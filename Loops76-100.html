<p>76.1 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Mac In Little Gotham</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac looked up from the bar he was tending and mused to himself. He was human at the moment, but it was all so very strange how he got there. At times, it seemed like the loops had a sense of humor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac awoke. It was dark, and he riding in some sort of vehicle. It blazed past the city streets, taking the corners and curves with practiced ease.</p><p class="double">A deep voice to the left of him spoke. &quot;Good. You&#039;re Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac turned, a man in a black cape and cowl sat in the drivers seat.</p><p class="double">&quot;I knew this was a variant loop from when I first met you. The Graysons aren&#039;t usually circus strongmen. I figured it was only a matter of time until you Awoke,&quot; Batman responded to the unasked question.</p><p class="double">He continued. &quot;First of all. What are your assets?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Super strength when I change size.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That will useful against Bane.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Plant growth abilities.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s either going to be an asset or liability against Poison Ivy. We&#039;ll look into that later.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Expert on gamma radiation&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me guess. You replaced Dr. Bruce Banner. You weren&#039;t kidding about the super strength.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bar tending skills.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;ll make a good cover.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Diplomacy and observation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Batman gave a snort. &quot;We&#039;ll see about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Any liabilities?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not much combat experience.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We can fix that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d rather not,&quot; said Mac in a firm voice.</p><p class="double">That elicited a pause and grunt. &quot;Fair enough. If nothing else I can use you in a support role.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.2 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, well, well... Been a <i>long</i> time since I seen your precious sun-loving faces,&quot; the voice boomed from the balcony. An alicorn stallion stepped out of the shadows and sneered down at the frighted ponies below. His pinstripe suit jacket and the fedora perched on his head seemed to drink the light, his grey coat only a shade lighter and the fringe of mane peeking from beneath the hat a deep crimson.</p><p class="double">&quot;What have you done with the Chairpony?!&quot; exclaimed Ivory Scroll, the local foremare.</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s right here, or don&#039;t you recognize me?&quot; he asked, raising a hoof to his chest in mock hurt. &quot;Spend a thousand years locked up an&#039; suddenly nopony knows who you are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know who you are!&quot; Twilight called out, deciding to play to the Loop&#039;s script. It was a lonely loop, but it looked to be an interesting variant, at the very least. &quot;You&#039;re Stellar Swindler, the Lunar Larcenist! A thousand years ago you tried to steal the sun, and now you&#039;ve returned to finish the job!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, somepony&#039;s done their homework,&quot; Swindler grinned. A business card levitated out of his front pocket before being flung down to embed itself in the floor just in front of Twilight. &quot;Get in touch, there&#039;s always room for go-getters in my organization. Still, not quite right. Never wanted to <i>steal</i> the sun, just... Hold onto it for a bit, until I got my fair share.</p><p class="double">&quot;See, for years my brother taxed day business, while I took the night. Guess who got the short end of that bargain?&quot; He shook his head ruefully. &quot;Not any more. Back then I was just going to collect the whole take until I broke even, but now...&quot; He grinned viciously, &quot;you ponies owe a thousand years in back taxes, and you have &#039;til sunup to to pay up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>What!?</i>&quot; Rainbow Dash exclaimed. &quot;There&#039;s no way we can get that kind of money in the next hour!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, there&#039;s no rush. See, there&#039;s no sunup <i>&#039;til</i> you pay up!&quot; He cackled uproariously before vanishing with a crack of thunder.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;-Because the Elements are right here!&quot; Twilight exulted as the shards of glass and steel scattered at her hooves started to glow. The trip through the Everfree had been mostly baseline with a few quirks, though some had been bigger than others, she reminded herself with a glance at the trio of Shadowbolts that had joined the party. And of course there had been that detour she&#039;d snuck off for towards the end...</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, who literally talked me into jumping off a cliff, represents the element of Convincing!&quot; Glass pieced itself into imitation gems and steel stretched into wire as the cheap jewelry formed around the farmer&#039;s neck.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy, who appeared harmless enough that a wounded manticore allowed her to approach, represents the element of Endearment!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie, whose song is <i>still</i> stuck in my head, represents Marketability!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, who convinced a river serpent that her tail would match the other half of his mustache, represents The Sell!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Rainbow Dash, who put on such a show that your Shadowbolts defected to join <i>her</i>, represents Pizazz!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s still only five!&quot; Swindler cried out. &quot;Without the sixth, the Elements of Chicanery are worthless!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re right, Stellar,&quot; Twilight said without faltering. &quot;Each of these on their own can only run a few minor scams. It&#039;s not until they work together that they reach their full potential. But they <i>are</i> working together, each subtly reacting to the sixth Element...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No... <b>No!</b>&quot; Swindler shrieked as Twilight levitated upwards, a crown resolving on her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right! <i>I</i> represent the last Element, the one that connects and guides the others! The Element of Scheming!&quot; The six of them rose into the air, raw power flowing through and around them as the Elements of Chicanery flared to life, energies combining and growing. In an instant their light flashed to blinding levels and-</p><p class="double">The Elements shattered like the cheap replicas they were. Swindler stared at them in shock for a moment before letting loose a mocking laugh.</p><p class="double">&quot;I should have known my brother&#039;s creations would fail at the critical moment! They always do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh,&quot; Twilight said, nudging a shard of glass with a hoof. &quot;Kinda surprised they lasted that long, really. Oh well, that&#039;s why we have backup plans.&quot; She opened her saddle bags and levitated out the six gems she&#039;d collected from the Tree of Harmony while Rainbow Dash had wowed the Shadowbolts. It always paid to be prepared.</p><p class="double">&quot;Honesty, Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Loyalty!&quot; she shouted, throwing each Element to its respective Bearer as she rattled off their names before placing the sixth just above her head. &quot;Friendship is magic! Harmony is go! <i>Fire!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">This time there was no buildup, only an instantaneous release of rainbow light as Twilight leveraged her finely honed mastery of the true Elements to cleanse the wayward brother.</p><p class="double">When the light died away it revealed the familiar, if alicorned, yellow form of Flim, his boater drifting down to settle gently on his head as he boggled. A moment later a flash of light in the window resolved itself into the regal form of Flam, Chairpony of the Equestrian Megacorp, his ethereal mustache floating on an unfelt breeze.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I don&#039;t know how I&#039;ll ever be able to thank for... Oh? What&#039;s this?&quot; he asked as he examined the piece of paper Twilight had been telekinetically prodding him with.</p><p class="double">&quot;My bill for services rendered, plus hazard pay,&quot; she answered. It might have seemed a little mean, but from what her Loop memories told her, alicorns or not they were still Flim and Flam.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aha,&quot; Flam replied, eyes twinkling with mischief. &quot;What a coincidence, that&#039;s <i>exactly</i> the same that I charge for using the patented Flamco Elements of Chicanery!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Those things?&quot; she asked, nodding towards the heap of broken jewelry. &quot;Flim broke them before I laid a hoof on them, I had to use the Elements of Harmony instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You, ah, got those old things working, did you?&quot; he asked, suddenly nervous.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, and since I got them from a tree located on unincorporated land, I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re an untaxable natural resource.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds about right,&quot; Applejack, master of tree tax law, interjected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, well...&quot; She could practically see him running sums against the treasury in his head as his eyes darted about wildly.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Flam,&quot; Flim said, stepping unsteadily up beside his brother. &quot;I hear Zebrica is lovely this time of year.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right you are, Flim! Terribly sorry, Twilight, we&#039;ll have to settle this later, my brother is in <i>desperate</i> need of recuperation! Goodbyyyyyyeeeeee!&quot; he shouted as he turned and bolted out the window, his brother close behind as he flapped frantically to keep up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh...&quot; Twilight pondered as she reviewed the corporate chain of command. &quot;...I think I&#039;m in charge now...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.1 continued (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was a simple job. Run a bar in a bad side of town. Keep my ear to the ground in case any useful information popped up. And then she walked in.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dr. Pamela Iseley, or Poison Ivy, as she was better known as. He&#039;d read her profile. Her MO was seducing wealthy men and leaving them high and dry. She was sitting at the bar, a potted plant next to her, an amaranth, if his guess wasn&#039;t wrong, which was looking unusually healthy and vibrant. More unusual was the owner herself, with her elbows on the bar with head in hands... and she was currently making doe eyes at him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it hot in here? Or is it just me?&quot; she asked casually.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can turn down the thermostat if you&#039;d like, Miss...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rose. Call me Rose.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well. Miss Rose, would you like me to turn down the thermostat?&quot;</p><p class="double">She blushed when I mentioned her pseudonym. She paused a for an abnormally long length, just staring at me.</p><p class="double">I spoke again. &quot;Miss Rose?&quot;</p><p class="double">She jumped. &quot;Would you like me to turn down the thermostat?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! No! Maybe if you could just refresh my drink, please?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She&#039;s now a regular at the bar. I looked over to where she was sitting. She gave a demure little wave. I waved back.</p><p class="double">Regardless, she wasn&#039;t the last villain to visit.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.3 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke once again. A hopeful Ping, and... She waited a little longer, maybe they just need a little more time to respond, it&#039;s not their fault, they couldn&#039;t know, they couldn&#039;t possibly know. They probably needed some more time, so she sent a few more Pings.</p><p class="double">Spike came to her and frantically waved his arms. &quot;Twilight! I&#039;ve been looking for you the whole day! Princess Celestia has a mission for you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m... a bit busy Spike,&quot; she said absentmindedly, pinging again, just in case someone woke up in the last few minutes.</p><p class="double">Spike looked her over. She looked terrible. &quot;Did, did you skip lunch? Also... Did you spend the whole day sitting here? Come on, the sun is going down and Celestia wants you to attend the Summer Sun Celebration in Ponyville and make some friends. A little vacation will do you some good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Friends... I want to see my friends again... thirteen times Spike... thirteen times I&#039;ve been alone... Yes, it&#039;s time for a vacation.&quot; And the sun that was just about to set froze on the horizon. &quot;It&#039;s time for a little Me time, yes... It&#039;s time for a little... Twilight Time.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;IS THERE ANYONE, ANYWHERE THAT THINKS TIME HAS REPEAT ITSELF? COME TO ME FOR GREAT PRIZES! I&#039;LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU DESIRE! YOU CAN RULE ALL OF EQUESTRIA! I&#039;D EVEN GLADLY FREE CELESTIA IF YOU WANT!&quot; The Message written on the Moon made a lot of Ponies seek her out. The liars were thrown in the dungeon for a few days, but the nutcases were treated with respect and even got a gold medal and a thousand bits for their bravery in coming forth. She didn&#039;t want to discourage anyone who thinks they are going crazy after all. There was a bit of dissent among her followers because the coastal flooding due to the closer Moon forced the evacuation of some cities, but that was crazy. How else could she fit the whole message in a readable size? Her thoughts were cut off when she was suddenly blasted with a rainbow from behind.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight Awoke as a foal. She immediately send out a Ping... Well, at least it wasn&#039;t a baseline. She was gonna try for another Cutie Mark.</p><p class="double">But when the day of the Rainboom came, she completely forgot about it. However with her extremely low spirits and unharmonious mindset there was no surge of power. Twilight was still a Blank Flank... Mhh...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>The very next Summer Sun Celebration Princess Celestia was just about to step on the stage, when the sun rose behind her without prompting. All the ponies thought it was a joke Celestia pulled when she stared slack jawed at the Sun as if not comprehending how it got there. When she felt for the Magic which raised it, her jaw met the ground. &quot;You! Little filly!&quot; She jumped down into the crowd, spooking her guards. The little purple pony was already walking away. &quot;Did you just raise the sun?&quot; she asked to the confusion of anypony present. That... that has to have been a prank.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. I saw you do it last year and wanted to try it myself where I could see your reaction, so I waited until now,&quot; the filly said with a bored expression.</p><p class="double">&quot;That is a very impressive feat. What would you say if I made you my personal student?&quot; The crowd backed away and some ponies stared at the little filly in awe, but most didn&#039;t buy it.</p><p class="double">They felt validated when the little filly laughed in Celestia&#039;s face, thinking her mask cracked. Oh how they would come to realize the &quot;Truth.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, as if you could teach me anything! I already know everything.&quot; Now it was Celestia&#039;s turn to laugh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, children. If you know everything, then why don&#039;t you have your Cutie Mark yet?&quot; The crowd chuckled along, really who was fooled? A Blank Flank raising the sun?</p><p class="double">&quot;Case in Point,&quot; the filly said with an air of superiority. &quot;I know exactly how Cutie Marks work. The fact that you have one and think I would want one is a reason why you couldn&#039;t possibly teach me anything. Who on Equestria would voluntarily weaken themselves by forcing their Magic into a specialization? If you have no Cutie Mark and have enough focus, everything is your Special Talent. I can do absolutely everything, because my Magic is still free. Come on, I just showed you I can raise the sun, test me. Everything is my Special Talent.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia looked around and liberated a tuba from her band. Twilight played the Equestrian National anthem and then a speedy solo that made the actual tuba player green with envy. Then she gave the filly a violin and a cello as well as a trumpet and a trombone, the filly played each perfectly. She turned a clarinet into a Fluegelhorn, an ancient instrument not seen in hundreds of years, but the filly played even that like a master which studied a lifetime. The filly then turned a mouse into a lion, made it jump through a conjured hoop and vanished a spear Celestia reluctantly threw her way, she then used martial arts to take away another guards spear and fought off a contingent of twenty pegasi guards with it. She build a statue of herself in a heroic pose and drew a Masterpiece worthy of any museum with a paste made of spittle and street dirt. She then vanished in a flash of light and brought back an Ursa Major, its Minor Baby and a Hydra which she taught a little dance number.</p><p class="double">If anypony still thought it was a prank, then they stopped when she ascended and made a moving sculpture out of clouds of two unicorns battling each other with real lightning. &quot;You... you can turn into an Alicorn!!!&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly just looked at her like she was stupid and lost her wings. &quot;Yes. I think I mentioned that to you...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? When?&quot; Celestia stared at her in confusion, her mind thoroughly blown.</p><p class="double">&quot;When I told you in no uncertain terms, that I could do absolutely everything,&quot; the filly retorted.</p><p class="double">Celestia teleported into her statue garden to check, that yes, Discord was still in its statue.</p><p class="double">&quot;Say little one... can you get the Mare in the Moon down here and free her from any corrupting influence?&quot; she asked, just in case. She regretted it immediately.</p><p class="double">Well, a flash, a short wait and a confused looking Nightmare Moon later, but still pretty soon.</p><p class="double">The Mare of Darkness looked around for a bit before grinning in a diabolical fashion. Then she started laughing manically:&quot;Free! Free at last! And now Equestria will feel my wrath and my revenge will be complete!&quot;</p><p class="double">Really it was fearsome. Everypony would have ran away in terror, had not the bored-looking purple filly balancing on her back spoiled the mood.</p><p class="double">Said filly touched her horn to the back of her head and Nightmare Moon&#039;s eyes went wide as she was assaulted by memories of her loving sister.</p><p class="double">Corruption melted away and left a weeping Princess of the Night. &quot;Sister... c-can... can you ever forgive me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Absolutely. Motherbucking. Every-URGH!&quot; started the bored filly before being Tacklehugged(TM) by Celestia. &quot;THANK YOU!&quot; she weeped, and nuzzled the filly. Luna looked shocked. Celestia saw and pulled her into The Hug. Twilight couldn&#039;t breathe. That was new.</p><p class="double"><i>I guess it&#039;s because instead of planning the whole thing for years it was from Zero-Hope to Luna-Right-There in one morning.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s your name, little filly?&quot; she finally asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twi-...light Spar...kle,&quot; she ground out.</p><p class="double">Celestia let her breathe and lifted her up for the crowd to see, taking wing and holding her up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Today we celebrate the nine hundred and ninety first Summer Sun Celebration, the return and recovery of Luna, Princess of the Night, and by my Royal Decree the Coronation of Princess Twilight Sparkle! The Princess of Absolutely Motherbucking Everything!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile Spike was sitting in a rock made to look like an egg. He didn&#039;t have ANY Magic, not even the tiniest smidgin, so he could only wait and wait until Twilight finally deigned to hatch him or activated the Elements, so he could mooch off of Loyalty. As it was he didn&#039;t even have the Magic to activate it himself...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.1 continued (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Harvey Dent&#039;s voice rasped, likely as a consequence of the burns to half of his face. &quot;All that time I spent as District Attorney.&quot;</p><p class="double">He took a sip of whiskey, out of one of the two shot glasses in front of him. &quot;Did I really accomplish anything? Sure I sent plenty of criminals to jail and Arkham. But they just then just got out. And then I get worst sunburn ever on half of my face.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac thought back to Two-Face&#039;s profile, it was chemical burn, but he nodded sympathetically.</p><p class="double">&quot;So I decided, if I can&#039;t accomplish anything as a good guy, why not try being bad guy? With my knowledge of the criminal underworld, I could become the biggest fish in the pond.&quot;</p><p class="double">He took another sip, one of a dozens he had that night. Mac really did sympathize. On the one hoof, these people were genuinely crazy, and needed help, but on the other hoof, a small piece at the back of his mind couldn&#039;t help but wonder at Gotham City&#039;s revolving door justice system. Arkham Asylum was cheap for the city budget. The staff was overworked and sometimes incompetent, his mind wandered back to Harlene Quinzel&#039;s case briefly, and their budget was underfunded due to rampant government corruption. This was in addition to the rumors that the place was cursed.</p><p class="double">&quot;But the Bat kept interrupting my plans! I can&#039;t accomplish anything as a good guy! I can&#039;t accomplish anything as bad guy! Do my choices really matter at all?&quot; Harvey promptly collapsed against the bar, sobbing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.4 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Mac tilted his head to look up at where Discord was seated on the ceiling. The dragonequus had walked into the bar, walked up the wall, and conjured a mirror image of the bar on the ceiling, before slumping dejectedly...up...on the countertop. Taking it in stride, Big Mac flipped a mug of one of Berry&#039;s &quot;Ascension Standards&quot; upwards, where it landed directly in front of Discord, who began drinking it through an elaborately conjured swirly straw.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what Loop&#039;s got yeh so up in the air?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord groaned. &quot;Smash Brothers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac blinked. Admittedly, fighting wasn&#039;t exactly his forte, but the couple of Loops he had spent in the Smash Brother Universe had been pretty smooth, all things considered. Big Mac nodded with a thoughtful silence, which encouraged Discord to continue.</p><p class="double">&quot;I mean, it&#039;s all so, formulaic. Yes, it&#039;s funny seeing one of the fighters try to figure out how to walk straight after a Topsy-Turvy Trick, but it gets old when that is all it can do. Even that Final Smash wasn&#039;t real chaos. It had 13 effects, and it would only do 1 at a time. And the glow I put off broadcast which it would be! How much more predictable could it get?&quot; Discord sighed before leaning over to lay an arm around Big Mac&#039;s shoulders.</p><p class="double">Big Mac started upon realizing that at some point he had ended up on a bar stool on the ceiling next to Discord. Below them, Berry giggled and trotted behind the bar to take over while Big Mac was busy with the moping chaos god.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.1 continued (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jervis Tetch, the one known as Mad Hatter, sat by the bar. He spoke up suddenly. &quot;Would you like to see a neat trick?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac raised his eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! No, it&#039;s nothing bad. Merely...interesting.&quot; He lifted a veiled box from its current position at his feet and lifted the curtain. Inside were two mice, one sitting and one standing on either side of a miniaturized bar counter. The sitting one was squeaking and gesturing wildly with his claws, while the other was nodding his head in agreement.</p><p class="double">Jervis grinned. &quot;I was right, was I not?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac nodded. &quot;I can&#039;t say that wasn&#039;t interesting. A mite creepy, but interesting.&quot;</p><p class="double">Another chuckle from Jervis was cut short, as the door to the bar slammed open suddenly. Waylon Jones, also known as Killer Croc, strod into the bar and up the counter. &quot;Your strongest stuff! Now!&quot; slamming his fist hard on the bar counter.</p><p class="double">The mouse cage jumped, nearly causing it to fall off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Careful you ruffian! It nearly fell!&quot; cried Jervis.</p><p class="double">Croc turned and gave the Hatter a hard look. &quot;Oh that&#039;s too bad. What are you going to do about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gentlemen. You both know the rules. No fighting in the bar,&quot; Mac stated firmly.</p><p class="double">Croc turned to Mac. &quot;Oh? As I said, what are you to do about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac started to grow, and turn green. As he did so, he said, &quot;Croc, you&#039;re beginning to annoy me. You would not like me when I&#039;m annoyed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Croc visibly paled. He turned to Jervis. &quot;Umm..sorry, Jervis old pal. Don&#039;t know what got over me.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.5 (Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p><i>Jab. Feint. One-two</i>. Big Macintosh sent another flurry of punches to his shadow while quickly shifting his weight between his two legs for warming up.</p><p class="double">It had been a strange loop, the first time Big Mac had looped as those human creatures Ms. Twilight had talked about, and it felt weird walking on two legs and having so little fur. Even less accommodating was the role his pre-Awakening self was doing: just practice for fighting?</p><p class="double">But he couldn&#039;t remove himself from his pre-Awake life so easily: he was outside his element, not even in Equestria, and even now he hadn&#039;t met anypony he could recognize. Add to that the world itself was the most different he could have imagined, being used to the simple life of being a farmer in Ponyville. He was frankly frightened.</p><p class="double"><i>Li&#039;l quick steps.</i> The rope jumping exercise was one of the most difficult to get the hang on, but after falling a lot of times he had mastered it. He was surprised how much it helped to build balance.</p><p class="double">And so Big Macintosh fought. At the beginning he lost badly, specially since he still hadn&#039;t managed to be the most stable on legs but the mountain of a human who was King Hippo probably had something to do with it. He almost didn&#039;t move but he could block every punch he tried. In the end, he managed to defeat him by using some comment Ms. Twilight told some time ago: humans have modesty on the clothes they wear, specially between their hind legs. It was a little luck King Hippo&#039;s shorts were a bit loose so he had to held them from falling off, and completely forgetting his defensive stance when he dropped them.</p><p class="double">The abdominal curls were an interesting exercise because Big Macintosh wasn&#039;t sure he could do it in his normal pony body; and while he thought doing a few hundreds at a time felt a bit much, he understood his body needed to be in a perfect fit. He was however worried about the fall as he was exercising hanging down, and while he had some idea at how resilient was this body to punches he didn&#039;t want to learn how resilient was his body to falling from the second floor.</p><p class="double">Still, punching felt awkward. Big Macintosh was much more used to bucking from so many seasons of apple harvesting but he was told it was an illegal move. And even then, he didn&#039;t like fighting or hurting anypony else. At least, Big Macintosh realized, the rules of what being allowed or not in fights, or boxing as the humans called it, were strict and not ever were broken. Even the annoying Ayan Ryan, who Big Macintosh thought was going to cheat somewhere in the fight, kept from fighting when he had fell from a hit apart from saying a few taunts.</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh didn&#039;t like fighting, he didn&#039;t want to like fighting, but he respected boxing as a sport even if he didn&#039;t want to participate on it after this loop.</p><p class="double">Now to the sandbag. Much like the beginning, a combination of quick and strong punches while rotating the sandbag would help the practice.</p><p class="double">Not all of the loop was bad, though. He left in silent good terms with Piston Hondo, which helped drive the point home about respecting the opponent and the sport and his own name had gained some notoriety. Not that he wanted the fame but it was the best idea he had about trying to find Ms. Twilight. This world was too big and strange to search alone. But that wasn&#039;t the whole reason...</p><p class="double">&quot;Quick feet, Mac Baby!&quot;</p><p class="double">Doc Louis, his trainer. When Big Macintosh arrived to his world he had the memories of Doc Louis training him, both in the gym and in the field running after his bike and the enormous trust both had on each other. Both his pre-Awake self, Little Mac, and Doc Louis were completely aware of how much the odds were stacked against him when they joined the WVBA and decided to go for the World Class Championship, and they still decided to challenge it. But the most important was...</p><p class="double">He felt a hand on his shoulder. &quot;That&#039;s enough for today, son. No need to overwork yourself today,&quot; said Doc Louis.</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh, along with his sisters Applejack and Applebloom, was orphaned young, soon after little Bloom&#039;s birth. It had been Granny Smith&#039;s job to raise them as well as take care of the farm. Of course, that meant he had to grow up a bit faster to help with the house&#039;s chores and raising his littlest sister. It was something that had always been a constant, even after time started looping. And he missed all of them terribly.</p><p class="double">However, this loop had given Big Mac something he didn&#039;t know he missed: a father figure. He could see how Doc Louis really meant it when he said son, even if his memories told him they weren&#039;t blood related. He had to find Ms. Twilight in this huge world, but maybe he could be a bit selfish and take this small pleasure, knowing that after the loop reset he would be back at Sweet Apple Acres with his family...</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh&#039;s blood ran cold. Was that how Applejack felt? Being so separated from her kin to yearn so hard being with her family again? Probably she even wished he would start Looping, much like he was told lil&#039; Applebloom was. <i>An&#039; then Ah hid from her until Ms. Twilight discovered me... Fewmets, Ah need to apologize to ma sister again.</i></p><p class="double">But that&#039;s for the next time they meet. Now he had to rest to fight the Title Match against Mr. Sandman tomorrow. He would enjoy his foster father this time and would mourn Little Mac, whom Big Macintosh thought he could have just unwillingly stolen his life.</p><p class="double"><i>Ye may never know me, Li&#039;l Mac, but tomorrow Big Mac will fight for the Doc&#039;s and yer dream.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.1 continued (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pamela Iseley approached Mac at the close of the bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mac, I&#039;d like to ask you something,&quot; she said. He briefly tensed up, imagining what was coming up next.</p><p class="double">&quot;Could you give me a job?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac blinked as his brain rebooted. After a few seconds, he once again found his wits.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, why do you want one, and in particular why here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I knew you&#039;d ask that. In truth, my name is not Rose, it&#039;s Pamela Iseley, but you might know me better as Poison Ivy, though I suspect you know all this already.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But in truth, I&#039;m not even really Pamela Iseley, I&#039;m some sort of plant-based clone of her. I found this out recently. It explained why my memories only go back a few years.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;You have some plant related ability, don&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac nodded.</p><p class="double">She turned to her side, &quot;Whenever I&#039;m around you I feel happier and more alive. The plants in here,&quot; she nodded to a half-dozen plants scattered throughout the bar, &quot;all grow and thrive despite the conditions they&#039;re in. I think this is why I was initially attracted to you.&quot;</p><p class="double">One more she turned to face Mac, &quot;But there&#039;s more to that, more to you. All these people with checkered pasts and questionable sanity. They come in, and you listen, and you don&#039;t judge them and they feel safe here. I feel safe here. I was originally going to ask if we could start going out, but I can&#039;t do that. I&#039;m not Pamela, I&#039;m not even sure who I am anymore. Are her goals my goals? Her thoughts, my thoughts?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know. But I don&#039;t think I can continue to live the life I&#039;ve been living. I want to see if I can do things differently. Be more than just a clone of Pamela Iseley.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac stood there, taking it all in. He finally responded. &quot;Alright, let&#039;s see if we can&#039;t teach you to mix a different set of poisons.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Bat was perplexed. This didn&#039;t happen often, and his experience as a looper meant that it was happening less and less often as time went on, but still...</p><p class="double">&quot;Reformed?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes,&quot; the clone who was now calling herself Lily Iseley reiterated. She&#039;d been released from Arkham several months after having turned herself in, and he wasn&#039;t sure if he was buying it.</p><p class="double">He mulled it over. &quot;I&#039;ll be watching you,&quot; he said, and vanished.</p><p class="double">Honestly, if things continued the way they were, it could wind up almost as bad as that time Nanoha &#039;befriended&#039; Darkseid...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.6 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Rainbow?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just realized we never had a real race.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow looked at her curiously. &quot;What? Surely we raced. We&#039;ve done absolutely everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No...&quot; Twilight considered. &quot;I mean we had car races, plane races, foot races, all stuff where it&#039;s about you having unfamiliar equipment or my superior engineering playing a role, but we never had an honest to goodness race by wing where both of us went all out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, probably because everyone knew the outcome...&quot; Rainbow said modestly.</p><p class="double">For her that is.</p><p class="double">Twilight was undeterred however. &quot;Yeah, still. Let&#039;s have a real race, both of us as Alicorns, to make it fair, but no Magic. A real all out competition where you give it your all, not you playing with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure. Once around the World?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, that&#039;s boring. Mh... Zecora isn&#039;t awake is she? Doesn&#039;t matter, she&#039;s still pretty knowledgeable, we&#039;ll let her plot out a course through all the most dangerous parts of the Everfree for us. I&#039;ll need a bit more time to get ready, limber up, become more used to my alicorn form. Let&#039;s race Saturday next week at noon!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;You... ha... ha... ha... you won...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight beamed a smile that would make any colt fall in love at two hundred paces. She couldn&#039;t talk of course, she could barely breathe...</p><p class="double">&quot;That... that cave...&quot; she gasped, &quot;I couldn&#039;t... see a thing in there...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me...&quot; croaked Twilight &quot;neither...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You... you... could... navigate it anyway... and... and you knew exactly when those stalactites would fall... you accelerated while they would miss you by inches...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;L-... Luck?&quot; stuttered Twilight between heaves.</p><p class="double">&quot;And... And you... knew what that... Ursa Major would do when you shouted &quot;Whoo Hoo!&quot; And... woke its Baby.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In... stinct?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You ducked low before the Hydra was even visible.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It wasn&#039;t exactly... quiet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the fight between the Manticore and the Pack of Timberwolves?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How many times have you asked Unawake Zecora for the most dangerous route through the Everfree forest?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... I... lost count?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How many times have you raced against my Unawake self and how long have you spend trying to extrapolate a winning strategy against my Awake self?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Since when did you plan this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Since shortly after you became a Looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now that I&#039;ve beaten all Alicorns and all Loopers and proved that I am the best flyer of all time, I will withdraw from the Alicorn Racing Cycle as undefeated Champion. No rematches.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT THE...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked twice.</p><p class="double">&quot;...what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Will you marry me?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn stared down at Rainbow Dash. &quot;Uh.... well. Hrm. You do realize we haven&#039;t dated.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...and I&#039;m straight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You can turn me into a colt, I don&#039;t mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...and probably asexual.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, sex isn&#039;t everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...and have no interest in romance whatsoever.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow grinned. <i>&quot;Yet.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Ever so carefully, Twilight extended a bit of her magic to examine her friend. After a moment, her eyes narrowed. &quot;Trixie put you up to this, didn&#039;t she Chrysalis.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash blinked twice as a blue unicorn removed her invisibility spell with a smug grin. &quot;Told you she wouldn&#039;t fall for it. Ten bits!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.8 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack peeked into the cabin containing Bloomberg. She was rather nervous about this trip out to Appleloosa, and the antics of the others weren&#039;t helping things. Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and that one unicorn Trixie were all playing tricks on each other, and she thought Spike might have joined in. Rarity was complaining about the trip, and Twilight had holed up in her bunk with a stack of books. The only one not causing trouble was Fluttershy, but that was normal.</p><p class="double">Sighing, Applejack made her way over to the tree. She checked the covers, inspected the apples to make sure they were all looking healthy, then sat back to read another bedtime story (more to calm herself than anything), when she noticed an odd pattern on the side of the trunk. She leaned in to get a better look. It looked sort of like a butterfly. Then, Bloomberg sneezed.</p><p class="double">Applejack froze. Despite what Rarity may have insinuated, she didn&#039;t actually expect Bloomberg to talk back or anything. Slowly, she responded. &quot;Bless ya?&quot; There was a shudder that ran through the tree and, with a second sneeze, the tree turned into Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s mouth fell open. Fluttershy shuffled her feet abashedly. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, Rainbow asked me too, because poor Spike...&quot; Fluttershy&#039;s explanation was cut off by the door to the cabin bursting open, and Spike, Pinkie, and RD bursting in, with Pinkie pulling Bloomberg through the doorway.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re back! Celestia had set the tree to the side, so I was able to just grab it. I don&#039;t think I lost any apples on...the way...back...&quot; Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice trailed off as she spotted Applejack, who was looking back and forth between Fluttershy and Bloomberg, her mouth gaping. &quot;Eh heh heh, Spike did it!&quot; Rainbow Dash shot back through the door way as Pinkie and Fluttershy carefully set Bloomberg back in his place, Pinkie helpfully sliding Applejack to the side and handing her a &quot;Yay, Bloomberg is Back!&quot; cupcake.</p><p class="double">&quot;What? Trixie&#039;s the one that hit me with the sneezing powder. Hey, don&#039;t just run off.&quot; Spike quickly ran after Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stood next to Trixie as they observed the talks between the Appleloosans and Buffaloes. Behind them, Pinkie was currently tied up to keep her from trying yet another song-and-dance number to fix the mess (she hadn&#039;t yet found one that really worked, though Pinkie still insisted the time she got both sides to team up to run them out of town was a success). As Thunderhooves issued his ultimatum, Trixie perked up, her horn glowing slightly, before Twilight stuck out her hoof in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;No dakka.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie slumped, pouting slightly, as the two sides walked away. Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;I told you, you get your turn <i>only</i> if negotiations break down completely.&quot; Trixie just sulked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight once again smacked her head as she took shelter under an overturned table. <i>Why did I think letting Trixie loose was a good idea?</i> She was joined in her impromptu fortress by both Chief Thunderhooves and Sheriff Silverstar, and together they watched as yet another round of explosive apple pies hurtled through the air. The property damage was minimal, for Trixie, anyway, and Trixie didn&#039;t seem to notice that all of her &quot;targets&quot; had since taken cover from her confectionery barrage.</p><p class="double">Sighing to herself, Twilight pulled out a sheet of paper. &quot;While I have both of you here, I have an agreement that should solve both of your problems. I will make the scary unicorn go away if you both sign...&quot;</p><p class="double">They ripped the first copy in the brief fight over who got to sign first.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.9 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Nurse Redheart, what&#039;s the prognosis?&quot; asked Celestia as they walked down the hospital hallway. She arrived immediately when she heard the news.</p><p class="double">The female pony walked over to Twilight&#039;s bed and looked at her clipboard on the door, &quot;According to these charts...she&#039;s...going through her earth pony phase.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia gasped...then blinked in confusion, &quot;Wait, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Redheart set down the clipboard and looked the sun pony in the eyes. &quot;Apparently it has to do with her connection to the Elements of Harmony. Her body is channeling the magic of friendship and she will eventually become an alicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">The nurse slid open the door, where Twilight lay in bed, lacking a horn on her head. The purple earth pony waved, &quot;Princess, I&#039;m glad you&#039;re here. When this-&quot; lifting up a purple unicorn horn in her hoof, &quot;happened, I freaked out. Thankfully, Spike calmed me down and took me to the hospital to get it checked out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Redheart smiled at Twilight, &quot;Your horn will grow back in time, Twilight. In a couple weeks, your body will shift to that of a pegasus and finally an alicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed in relief, and then her eyes went wide again, &quot;Oh gosh! Will that make me a princess? What if the other ponies don&#039;t like me? Or worse, I make a mistake and end up in a war against the Griffon Empire? Or worse, accidentally release Discord when I try learning how to fly? You won&#039;t send me back to magical kindergarten if I mess up, would you Celestia?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia trotted over to her and nuzzled her head, &quot;I&#039;m not going to make you a princess, Twilight, if you don&#039;t want me to. And I would never send you back to magical kindergarten. You&#039;re my faithful student, and nothing will change that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed in relief again. That sweet moment was ended at Redheart clearing her throat. &quot;Princess Celestia, she is not the only case of this. Apparently, the other five element bearers are also going through their alicornification phases. If you would accompany me, they will need to be re-assured that everything is alright too.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After Celestia had visited all the Element Bearers, she departed from the hospital to rent a room in the local inn. Luna took over for her duties back at Canterlot for the next month, besides raising the sun. Back at the hospital, Nurse Redheart slid the door closed of Twilight&#039;s room, and a purple light covered the walls, ensuring no one could hear their conversation. An alicorn Twilight was the first to speak. &quot;Thank you for your assistance, Nurse Redheart. Couldn&#039;t have done it without you and Pinkie&#039;s replica unicorn horn.&quot;</p><p class="double">Redheart gave a rueful grin, &quot;It was kind of fun and exhilarating, pranking the princess like that. Maybe one day if I start &#039;looping&#039; as you put it earlier, we can do this again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight floated a camera in front of herself and Redheart and gave a big grin as the flash went off, &quot;Will do!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.10 (TheCentauress)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight hated Poison Joak. Hated it with a passion. It <u>ALWAYS</u> screwed with her mana-abilities. The current situation was a perfect example; her horn was inverting all her effects with a half-twist in a random plane.</p><p class="double">And the Ursa Minor was approaching town.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy!&quot; she yelled! &quot;BABY! <b>CUTE BABY!</b>&quot; Then she ducked.</p><p class="double">The town was shocked upon seeing the Town Hall-sized Ursa Minor being rocked in a cradle made of a rapidly-grown willow, while being fed from a long, hollow vine with a gigantic nipple tied to the end. They were even more shocked when an actual Ursa Major trotted up a few moments later, looked down at the scene then flopped over on its side outside the town border and dozed off.</p><p class="double">The lavender mare grinned. She loved it when a plan came together. Praise the Blue Spruce that <i>Fluttershy </i>liked her &#039;cute and cuddly&#039; critters... maybe she could get the pegasus an apprenticeship with Hagrid some Loop...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">76.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Cadance stopped dead, her ears perking.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Honey?&quot; Shining Armor nudged her. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing&#039;s wrong.&quot; The pink alicorn&#039;s voice was distant. &quot;But I think something might be right. Do you mind if I disappear for a bit?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I guess not--&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining blinked. In a flash of blue magic, Cadance had vanished. After a moment, he shook his head. &quot;Probably has something to do with that Chrysalis mare that dropped by for the wedding...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;A<i>ha!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance marched forward, pointing a pink hoof at the eight-legged stallion. &quot;I knew it! I knew it had to be you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I&#039;m sorry?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Large bursts of love aren&#039;t anything new, but love fueling up from deep magic?&quot; She grinned. &quot;I thought to myself, it has to be an admin, and that meant it had to be an admin familiar with this place. And that meant you, most likely.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir sighed awkwardly, turning to the anthropomorphic mare sitting across from him. &quot;Sorry about this, Epona, she&#039;s... she&#039;s a romantic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not really a problem,&quot; his date replied, giving Cadance a small smile and offering a hand. &quot;Hello. I&#039;m Epona, Celtic goddess of steeds and fertility.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m Mi Amore Cadenza, local goddess of romantic love.&quot; The alicorn put a hoof in the offered hand and shook firmly. &quot;Buuuuut you can call me Cadance. It&#039;s so nice to meet you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You certainly seem like an eager young demigod. I do approve of you and Shining, you make a nice couple.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks! So...&quot; The alicorn tilted her head. &quot;How&#039;s Sleipnir been treating you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Epona smiled. &quot;He&#039;s been a perfect gentleman. Or is it gentlestallion around here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gentlecolt, actually.&quot; Cadance smiled to herself as the Odinsteed buried his blushing face in four hooves. &quot;I expected nothing less of him.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='81'></a><h3>Loops 77</h3>
<p>77.1</p><p class="double">Different loopers had different skills, different specializations, and different patterns.</p><p class="double">For Chrysalis – Changeling Queen, expert telempath, skilled general psion, mean strategist, and marefriend – the most important of the latter was a skill she had cultivated over many years.</p><p class="double">No matter what the previous loop had been like, no matter how cataclysmic the circumstances or unexpected the transition, the very first thing she did when she entered a new loop was to automatically lock down any alternate form she was in.</p><p class="double">Which was fortunate.</p><p class="double"><i>Think Fluttershy thoughts...</i> she chanted in the back of her mind. Outwardly, she smiled at the various animal friends she&#039;d been in the middle of feeding.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m just a nice, slightly cowardly pegasus who lives alone and works with animals. That&#039;s me.</p><p class="double"></i>She scattered some grain for the chickens.</p><p class="double"><i>Pay no attention to the changeling behind the transformation.</p><p class="double"></i>One of the crows cawed something purposeful.</p><p class="double"><i>...buck. I can&#039;t speak animal. Right, going by his emotions, he&#039;s... leaving.</p><p class="double"></i>The butter-coloured pegasus waved. “Good luck... if you want it, that is...”</p><p class="double">Apparently this was the right choice, as the crow nodded to her before taking wing. He circled the clearing once, and flew off towards the south.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p><i>Okay,</i> Chrysalis thought to herself, trying for &#039;calm&#039;. <i>It looks like Angel is fooled. That or he doesn&#039;t give a carrot-top, of course.</p><p class="double"></i>Despite her title, she wasn&#039;t <i>always</i> Queen, even when she was a changeling. Sometimes she was an elected president. Sometimes she was the Voice of the Changeling Hive.</p><p class="double">And sometimes, like this time, she was a passed-over princess, with some form of sibling queen in her place.</p><p class="double"><i>Right. Taking stock.</p><p class="double"></i>She was an exile from the changeling hive, for having lost out in the succession. That wasn&#039;t exactly great, since if her &#039;sister&#039; – apparently called Metamorphia – stuck to the same schedule as Chrysalis herself had done, then things would get quite complicated in two years.</p><p class="double"><i>What else do I need to know...</p><p class="double"></i>Paranoia against Changelings was... actually present. That made things worse – if this had been otherwise baseline, then she could literally have gone up to Celestia and explained herself.</p><p class="double">The plus side (scant as it was) was that there wasn&#039;t a &#039;real&#039; Fluttershy locked in the basement or anything. This loop, it seemed, she had come up with &#039;Fluttershy&#039; independently.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis frowned, shook her head, and decided to just roll with it.</p><p class="double">After all, if she managed to keep it up, everything would be fine. Right?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Apparently S-<i>Twilight</i> wasn&#039;t Awake, amazing as that seemed.</p><p class="double">Certainly nothing she said indicated anything of the sort, and Chrysalis put all her acting ability into trying to be as <i>Fluttershy</i> as possible.</p><p class="double">Coordinating the songbirds&#039; song was surprisingly like directing the hive, actually. Music instead of the constant presence of the hive mind, to be sure, but a wrong note still felt the same.</p><p class="double">As they came to an end, she smiled nervously. “Um... was that okay?”</p><p class="double">“That sounds great!” Twilight replied, smiling. “I think we can check that one off, Spike.”</p><p class="double">“Good...” Chrysalis said, quietly.</p><p class="double">It was <i>really</i> strange, seeing Sparkle like this. Her first memories of the purple unicorn were of her... firstly, defeating a well-laid plan of hers. And second, the time which stuck in her memory more than any other, the alicorn of magic who had overturned a thousand years of cruelty in a single day.</p><p class="double">Seeing her as a magically adept geek with effectively no experience was... bizarre. Especially from this perspective. And feeling her simple enthusiasm over the Summer Sun celebration was... even more so.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis had occasionally been in town during the Return Of Nightmare Moon (referred to with the capitals), but usually because she and Trixie had decided to relocate to Ponyville straight off. Loops like that, the dark alicorn got interrupted mid-speech by a bolt of blue magic the size of a tree trunk, as Trixie Lulamoon declared her intent to &#039;contest&#039; the position of Master of Ceremonies.</p><p class="double">Thought of Trixie brought a faint smile to her lips, but Chrysalis shook it off as the Nightmare batted aside a pair of guards. This was genuinely serious stuff.</p><p class="double">She listened with half an ear to the speech, having heard it all before – but she wanted to catch if there&#039;d been any unanticipated changes to the events of this loop. (That or whoever the anchor was this loop showing up, anyway. Usually they ended up interrupting the Summer Sun celebration, if they hadn&#039;t been contacted before then.)</p><p class="double">Nothing unusual happened, which was a relief – right up until Chrysalis thought past the immediate situation to what would happen next.</p><p class="double">She was replacing Fluttershy. The Elements wouldn&#039;t work.</p><p class="double"><i>Well, buck.</p><p class="double"></i>Okay. Options...</p><p class="double">Could Twilight handle Nightmare Moon without the Elements? Yes – if she was Awake.</p><p class="double">Trixie? The same answer presented itself.</p><p class="double">Discord was a no-no, and if Celestia could sort it all out then she&#039;d have done it already.</p><p class="double">What about Cadence? That was less certain. It was hard to tell just how powerful Princess Mi Amore Cadenza was in the baseline, but from what Chrysalis remembered – defeating her in battle that long ago day – it wasn&#039;t up to much in direct combat.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis swallowed. <i>Looks like it&#039;s going to have to be me.</p><p class="double"></i>Fortunately, her pre-awakening time as Fluttershy had given her a respectable reserve of magic, drawn from the love of her animals. She was going to need every bit of it, and all of her looping skill, to pull <i>this</i> off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The first step was to actually get close to Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">The Return itself was a bust – by the time she&#039;d started planning, the Nightmare had already left. Which meant she was tagging along with Twilight&#039;s expedition.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d used the excuse that she had to help them with getting through the Everfree. It was true, as far as it went – she could sense any monsters around, and her loop memories contained a reasonable map of the place – but there was a deeper reason, as well. A debt to be paid.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, and Fluttershy, and Rarity and Pinkie and all the rest of them, had helped her out when she started looping. Back when she was &#039;young&#039;.</p><p class="double">Now <i>she</i> was the old, experienced one. And she <i>would</i> keep them safe.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">77.2 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight?” Rainbow Dash asked after zooming in through the library’s window. The unicorn hadn’t even had time to properly reorganize the place after her arrival from Canterlot this loop. “Snowflake’s been replaced by a looper, and… uhh… it’s weird.”</p><p class="double">The purple mare sighed and nodded. “How weird?”</p><p class="double">“Well, she’s not used to being a pegasus… or flying. We got her to my place before she decided she wasn’t going anywhere until someone explained what was going on, and I figured you’d do better than me with this one.”</p><p class="double">Nodding again, Twilight cast a cloudwalking spell on herself before teleporting the both of them to Dash’s cloud flat. There sitting on a puffy couch made of cloud was a regal mare with gossamer wings, her coat an icy blue and her mane a braided silver. On her flank was an intricate snowflake pattern.</p><p class="double">“Hello, my name is Twilight Sparkle. I’m the local Anchor here in Equestria.” When the mare nodded understanding, she continued. “What’s your name?”</p><p class="double">“My name is Elsa… and I am very confused.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After she’d finished her ‘welcome to the multiverse’ speech, Rainbow having left halfway through to go manage the Summer Sun Celebration while they were busy, Twilight asked, “So, are you your world’s Anchor?”</p><p class="double">Shaking her head, partially to clear her mind after the information dump, Snowflake- or rather, Elsa, answered, “I do not believe so. My sister’s fiancé, Kristoff, is most likely our Anchor. He sometimes speaks of loops where neither myself nor my sister recall the loops. My sister, myself, Kristoff, and we believe his reindeer Sven, all began looping in time simultaneously.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Probably the crash, then.”</p><p class="double">“The… crash?” Elsa tentatively probed.</p><p class="double">“I haven’t worked it into the speech proper yet because it tends to be very intimidating, especially with how overwhelming everything else is in one’s first fused loop. Fairly recently, an entire reality collapsed. The strain on the system led to new loopers in established loops, and new worlds gaining anchors and loopers, to minimize the damage.”</p><p class="double">“An entire…” Elsa paused, taking a moment to recollect herself. “That is indeed very troubling to hear.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry too much,” Twilight said, trying to calm the mare down some. “There were extenuating circumstances, and in all my time as an Anchor I’ve only seen it happen that one time. Both our worlds are safe.”</p><p class="double">It wasn’t much, but hearing that <i>did</i> help to comfort her a bit. “And… are there many other loopers and anchors about?”</p><p class="double">This had the purple mare laughing “Oh, <i>loads</i> of them! I don’t think I’ve met even half of them, but that’s still quite a lot of po-eople…” She caught herself at the last moment. “I like to think that I’m fairly old and well-versed as far as Anchors go, but there are a lot that’ve been looping longer than me, and none of us even compare to the first loopers, who’re truly ancient compared to the rest.”</p><p class="double">Seeing the goggle-eyed mare in front of her, she giggled. “Sorry, I’m trying to say that it’s a big multiverse out there, and there’s no end of new people to meet in the loops.” Her grin faltered. “There’s also no end of trouble you can get into in the other loops, as well. Some of them are pretty horrible, which is why we decided our loop would be a sanctuary. We do our best to make sure that our loop is as peaceful and pleasant as possible for any looper that needs a vacation. Our loops are usually about five years long, and that’s not much compared to some of the longer loops, but we try to help with the time we’re given to do so.” Sensing a segue, she pounced on it. “So, how long are your loops?”</p><p class="double">“Between five and ten years, usually,” Elsa answered. “The only constant seems to be that they include my coronation somewhere along the line.”</p><p class="double">“Coronation?” The unicorn gasped. “You’re a princess?”</p><p class="double">This had the Pegasus grinning. “I am a <i>queen</i>. Queen Elsa of Arendelle.”</p><p class="double">Of all the reactions she was expecting, having the unicorn speed in front of her staring intently at her forehead was not on the list. Flinching away from the sudden close proximity, she asked “What… are you doing?”</p><p class="double">Something seemed to snap back into place in the purple mare as she twitched and her eyes widened. “Oh, sorry. It’s not that common that we see royalty from other loops here in Equestria. Most of our ‘royals’ are alicorns- ponies with both pegasus wings <i>and</i> a unicorn’s horn.”</p><p class="double">Elsa tilted her head and raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, what I meant was that Fused Loops have a tendancy to be ironic or humorous with one’s role or status or especially their name or job - the pony you’re taking the place of this loop is named Snowflake, for instance. Given that’s also your cutie-mark.” She received another blank look and popped off a quick summary. “It’s a magical glyph or symbol on our flanks usually received in adolescence depicting a strong aspect or talent deeply ingrained in us. Magical ponies are magical.” She showed her own starburst as an example. “Anyway, yours is a snowflake. I’m going to hazard a guess that means something personal to you?”</p><p class="double">The pegasus’ mouth worked soundlessly, even as she glanced down at the ice crystal on her rear that she’d inspected for a time between Dash’s exit and return, for a moment before she nodded. “I was born with a curse - incredible power over ice and snow…” She paused trying to find a nice way to put the rest.</p><p class="double">“That doesn’t sound like much of a curse,” Twilight hazarded, tentatively.</p><p class="double">“I accidentally plunged my kingdom into an eternal winter until I learned to control it,” the queen said, deadpan.</p><p class="double">Twilight was about to say something, but then shut her mouth with an audible ‘click’. “Alright, that sounds more like a curse.”</p><p class="double">The Pegasus nodded. “It’s controlled in part by myself, and in part by my emotions. It’s taken several loops of trial and error to fully understand it, but negative emotions like fear and doubt wrest control away from me. I’ve been solving the issue by blotting them out with love and joy.”</p><p class="double">“That seems like a terrible solution,” Twilight pointed out, worry clear in her voice.</p><p class="double">Her concerns were waved away. “It’s worked well enough so far, especially with all these loops of practice. I haven’t accidentally frozen the entire kingdom in ages.” She began to chuckle, but when the unicorn didn’t share her mirth she stopped. “It was a joke, dear. I haven’t lost control of my powers since my… baseline, was it?” At the mare’s nod, she continued with a small grimace. “I’m not adapting to the loops as well as Anna and Kristoff. My sister jumps headlong into everything and her beau can be rather savvy when the urge strikes him, or he has need to be. Sometimes I feel like I’m still the stuffy princess locked away in her room, watching them have fun and play pranks while I manage trade agreements and paperwork…” She shook her head and chuckled. “No, I have enough fun when they drag me out to play, too. Maybe I should be the one to prank them next time, though… They just seem to be taking this so much better than me.” She glanced down shame-faced.</p><p class="double">The purple pony scooted over to nudge the queen. “Hey, it’s actually pretty impressive that you haven’t gone crazy yet. I don’t know a single pony that didn’t go a <i>little</i> nuts adapting to the loops.” She made a show of thinking to herself. “Except Zecora, but I’m keeping a camera handy just in case.”</p><p class="double">“You’ve been at this for so long and yet you’re still so… <i>chipper</i> about it. How do you manage it?”</p><p class="double">“Our universe is approximately 40% Pure Harmony, 25% friendship, 15% love, 10% hijinks, 5% kindness, 4% sugary treats, and like one percent assorted evils, megalomaniacs and in-jokes,” Twilight said. A moment passed before her deadpan straight face broke and she snickered, causing the queen to break down in giggles herself.</p><p class="double">“So.” The unicorn continued, “We’ve got about five years in a peaceful loop to look forward to. But first we have to make sure you’ve got the tools to enjoy it properly - since you’re a pegasus, that means learning to fly.” She gave a tentative smile to the regal mare. “If you think you’re up to it?”</p><p class="double">A meek smile mirrored back at her. “I think I can manage… but how are you going to-?” A bright flash and suddenly the unicorn in front of her also bore a pair of wings. “…ah.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, I just think you’re better off learning the basics from me before Rainbow Dash gets ahold of you…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">77.3 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&#039;I&#039;m a Princess. Are you a Princess, too?&#039; proclaimed the poster with Celestia&#039;s mischievously grinning head on it. Big Mac just stared at the thing. It was stuck to one of the apple trees that he was scheduled to take care of today.</p><p class="double">He could practically sense the chaos magic wafting from it, along with the faint scent of cinnamon and sugar. That meant Discord and Pinkie Pie. That, in turn, meant headaches for himself, at the very least.</p><p class="double">There were twelve little tabs on the bottom of the poster, grouped in four sets of three; two tabs with a picture of a wing alternating with one that had a picture of a horn.</p><p class="double">His adamant reluctance to ascend to an alicorn state was fairly well known by the other loopers. Still, experience had taught him that the best way to take care of a Pinkie and Discord prank is to completely subvert it. His years of earth pony magic mastery should help with that.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac walked into his bar and promptly ignored all the stares, acting as though absolutely nothing at all was wrong.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, Mac,&quot; a wide eyed Berry Punch spoke out tentatively, &quot;I think there&#039;s something different about you today.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I did try to part my mane in a new way. Is that it?&quot; Mac asked with a neutral expression while temporarily putting clean glasses on the four unicorn horns running along the length of his spine like the spikes on some dragons. His seven asymmetrically sprouting pegasus wings flapped gently, including the one placed where a normal unicorn&#039;s horn would be.</p><p class="double">&quot;No. No, that&#039;s not it.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">77.4 (Masterweaver and Wing Zero 032)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight loved to experiment. She was a scientist at heart... well, a scholar, actually, but science was a good part of that. And sometimes, during lonely loops, she would take a little sociological experimentation, mostly consisting of putting ponies in situations they hadn&#039;t been in before. Usually it all worked out or, at the least, she was able to repair the damage, and ninety nine point nine five oh three percent of the time she would have had the results on her list of possibilities.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Do you, Maud Pie, take the Tree of Harmony to be your lawfully wedded...&quot; Twilight paused. &quot;...spouse?&quot;</p><p class="double">And then there were times like these.</p><p class="double">Maud Pie nodded. &quot;I do.&quot; Loops of experience had taught Twilight to pick up on the slight quaver in her voice that occurred whenever she was excited, as well as the ear flick of glee and the small smile of deep love.</p><p class="double">Honestly, she just wanted to see how Maud reacted to the Tree. She&#039;d expected some amazement and maybe the need to restrain Maud from taking a sample...</p><p class="double">&quot;And do you, Tree of Harmony, take Maud Pie to be your lawfully wedded bride?&quot; Twilight raised an eyebrow as the Tree pulsed once with light and powerful magic, its crystal vines wrapping around Maud&#039;s shoulders. &quot;I&#039;m.. just going to take that as a yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">An unawake Pinkie dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief. &quot;They just look so happy together...!&quot; The other element bearers agreed, with varying degrees of unease.</p><p class="double">&quot;If there&#039;s somepony or something that may oppose this union, speak now or remain quiet forever.&quot; Suddenly, the huge diamond-shaped boulder known as Tom burst into the cave of Harmony interrupting the ceremony as it slowed down its roll until it stopped nearly in front of Maud.</p><p class="double">Everypony was stone-cold frozen by this sudden interruption, they all knew Tom very well, he helped them to defeat Discord by providing heavy artillery, bombardment and cover for them. That and the fact that Rarity had a fling with him during that time, however said fling ended so bad to the point in which Rarity still insist to never speak of it again! Despite the brave attempts of him being her rock during hard times, and even attempting to bringing her a serenade... a rock serenade where she lives with the help of his buddies in the rock band!</p><p class="double">There was a time where it looked like he would hit rock-bottom, he felt like a stepping stone and with a heart ground to dust, however they all knew Tom&#039;s character is really rock-solid based with well grounded morals and principles. Sure he may have a stone-cold attitude but he has a heart of gold, a temper of steel never taking things for granite even despite sometimes it looks like it, so it was no surprise when he had managed to roll away from his depression and start again, however they never had expected him to take interest for Pinkie&#039;s sister Maud, when he saw her, it hit him like a ton of bricks! He fell for her like a rock, she make him roll for her, and tried to woo her with his strength and solidity, but she didn&#039;t even bat an eye at him at all, always giving him that look that clearly says: &#039;You&#039;ve been friendzoned&#039;. But when she started to see that Tree Of Harmony... he could deal with that, he&#039;s made of stern stuff, but when he got the news by Boulder that she was going to marry that tree... That was the pebble that started the landslide!</p><p class="double">&quot;Tom, what are you doing here?&quot; Maud asked, nopony could be sure if she was curious or annoyed, it&#039;s Maud after all.</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot; The rock said nothing... nothing at least understandable or even audible to normal pony ears (The Pie Family doesn&#039;t count!).</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m flattered that you think of me that way, but I can&#039;t be with you in this way,&quot; said Maud in in her apparently permanent rock hard expressions, only Pinkie knew that her sister was taken aback by Tom&#039;s declarations.</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot; The rock stood there, not moving one inch, silence ruling all over the cave.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, I really know but we were not meant to be, I love the Tree of Harmony and he loves me back as much as I do, please understand!&quot; Maud replied back at whatever Tom said, apparently this having touched a nerve on the usually stoic mare.</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot; Tom stood his ground once again, the Element Bearers couldn&#039;t help but not take their sight or try to interrupt this weird romance drama.</p><p class="double">&quot;Stop being stubborn as a rock and please, let me go! If you truly love me, let me go. I know you had your heart broken once, and I may have broke it once again, but trust me. There are other mares that may be interested in you...&quot; said Maud, her hard-rock mask of indifference completely blown to cinders, then she approached to the diamond shaped boulder and slowly caressed one of his top sides as if it were the cheek of his face. &quot;Just between us, but my sister Pinkie finds you attractive, why don&#039;t you give it a go, she may be look happy and energetic when surrounded by other ponies, but deep down she&#039;s so alone and insecure, she needs something to keep her grounded and stable, she needs someone who be her rock when hardship happens, and I think you, especially you, may be the rock for the job, because I don&#039;t trust <i>those other friends</i> of hers, specially that Rocky fellow, something&#039;s wrong with them.&quot; Just as she finished, she give him a good bye kiss on the &#039;check&#039; and head back to the improvised altar.</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot; A drop of water fell over the diamond-shaped rock, it was weird how it kind of resembled a tear, giving the impression that the rock was completely heartbroken... again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you for understanding, and I wish you happiness with whoever you end with, please take care of her,&quot; said Maud to the internally crushed rock, sitting there in utter defeat until the pink bridlemaid approached him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on Tommy, I know it&#039;s hard to you to bear with it, but remember, I&#039;m always here for you,&quot; Pinkie said to Tom while somehow lifting him like nothing, taking him away from this heart grinding scene.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then by the power invested in me by Celestia, I proclaim you mare and... tree.&quot; Twilight snapped her book of matrimony shut. &quot;You may now kiss the bride – er, if you can?&quot;</p><p class="double">It turned out the Tree could kiss Maud, very passionately. Somehow.</p><p class="double">Then it turned out that neither Maud or the Tree had much modesty so the element bearers and rock rapidly cleared out to let them have their honeymoon in peace.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;So... Did we got our Siege Weaponry Cutie Marks?&quot; said Sweetie Belle using a pair of scopes, looking where their projectile went and where it hit, Appebloom still looking at the giant catapult, looking for any failures or damages and Scootaloo still pulling the trigger.</p><p class="double">The three of them started trying to look at their flanks, like little puppies chasing their own tails, however it was still as blank as they were since the morning.</p><p class="double">&quot;Awww...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>77.5 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight came into Mac&#039;s bar carrying a book of ridiculous size, which was, however, dwarfed by her grin.</p><p class="double">She was shortly followed by every single Looper in Equestria. Pinkie bounced against the wall and pushed it back, while Discord conjured thirty different Chairs.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have called all of you here to tell you about the Loop before last, which was a variant where... well, it&#039;s best if I start at the beginning. I thought it was a lonely baseline until Rarity eloped with Big Macintosh.&quot; She looked meaningfully at the mare in question. &quot;That has happened before, that&#039;s the loops after all, however when Big Mac came to me for advice on dealing with a pregnant mare I knew that there was something fishy going on. Turns out Rarity lied to him to force a wedding, because she thought she was pregnant with Applejack&#039;s foal,&quot; Twilight looked at some raised hooves, &quot;I didn&#039;t want to know and neither do you&quot;, the hooves went down, &quot;and then Rainbow punched Applejack for cheating on her and Pinkie was heartbroken because she wanted to get with Rainbow and she and Big Mac comforted each other and Rainbow went after Fluttershy, but Fluttershy was pregnant with Nightmare Moon&#039;s foal until it turned out she wasn&#039;t and then Discord came back and was reformed instantly when Celestia told him someone revived their stillborn lovechild, which turned out to be Spike, so Discord was eternally grateful to me and became a father to Spike and made him into an adult so he could court Rarity, who in the meantime became a destitute maid working for Blueblood. Meanwhile everyone thought they were pregnant again while I wasn&#039;t looking and Applejack came back from the Everfree forest just in time for her own wedding to Rainbow, to reveal she didn&#039;t cheat on Rainbow with Rarity, it was her evil twin instead. It turned out to not be a changeling but an actual twin Big Mac and Applebloom knew nothing about.&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone but Pinkie was lost in the inaneness.</p><p class="double">&quot;After that I stopped paying attention and just made a ton of Photos.&quot;</p><p class="double">She held up the tome: &quot;I have here pictures of fake pregnancies, evil twins and interrupted weddings between any two of you. That&#039;s Four hundred and thirty five only counting the weddings between Loopers. Every single one of you has also married Prince Blueblood in that Loop. Shining Armor married him twice.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Book went up in flames.</p><p class="double">&quot;And of course I have tons of copies of that tome. I do, now and forever, dominate the Blackmail-Material contest...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">77.6 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was walking down the street as normal when Pinkie came by walking Gummy.</p><p class="double">Gummy however, was slightly larger than normal and sporting full, puffy, and gleefully pink lips.</p><p class="double">She paused to process this. &quot;Big lipped... alligator moment?&quot; she asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Big lipped alligator moment,&quot; Pinkie replied with a nod.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright then.&quot; Twilight nodded, continuing about her day.</p><p class="double">Neither of them ever mentioned it again.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">77.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...who wrote this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You did.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;A nonlooping you, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...huh.&quot; Sweetie Belle flipped through the script again. &quot;Expansion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I think I was trying to mimic one of Spear Shaker&#039;s comedies and didn&#039;t get that it was a comedy.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">77.8 (Crisis, in honour of April 1)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight yawned as she Awoke in her closet at Sugarcube Corner. The evidence around her suggested that it was a bit later in the Loop than normal, but it was hardly the first time that had happened.</p><p class="double">According to her Loop memories, she and the other Elements of Harmony had redeemed Trollestia after the Hearth&#039;s Warming celebration just last afternoon and they had plans to hang out together later today.</p><p class="double">Twilight grabbed her breadbox and stepped outside, only to nearly be run over by Cheese Sandwich as he shucked by. &quot;Sorry, Twilight!&quot; the unicorn snarled as he skadoodled on his way. Twilight looked around Las Pegasus and noted the incredulously pea soup green sky and the blue sun sneezing down upon the populace backwards as Fleur De Lis approached her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings Twilight, my dear heir,&quot; she said politely. &quot;How are you this fine chair?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think I got enough sleep,&quot; Twilight replied wearily. &quot;I&#039;m going back to bed until things start making sense again.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">77.9 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;You came in that thing?&quot; asked Cadance as she looked down on the <i>Falcon</i> from the observation gallery. &quot;Huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luke&#039;s thoughts took a minor stumble. He was so used to Leia -- Awake or not -- snarking at Han about his ship that even this minor change brought him up short.</p><p class="double">So it was that the appearance of the stormtrooper patrol caught him by surprise.</p><p class="double">This was nothing compared with his outright bewilderment when he heard Cadance&#039;s ululating battle cry.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ailalalalalalala!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance&#039;s metal ring caromed off a wall to perform an intricate pattern of ricochets between the stormtroopers&#039; helmets and other nearby objects before rebounding to her hand.</p><p class="double">{{That was...rather impressive,}} Chewbacca growled over the semi-conscious groans of the patrol, now slumped against bulkheads or prostrate on the deck.</p><p class="double">&quot;Totally awesome!&quot; agreed Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Took me forever to get the hang of this thing,&quot; admitted Cadance, twirling the chakram on a fingertip.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie led the still-groggy Imperial tech toward the <i>Falcon</i>&#039;s boarding ramp. Apple Bloom brought up the rear with the now-empty homing device case held in her heavy-duty manipulator arm.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Hope you feel better soon, sir. The activation and tracking codes for the device are entered on the status panel as per regulations. All you need to do is log them with the comm center. Do you need any further assistance?&quot; she asked as they left the ship. The astromech extended the case with a helpful twitter.</p><p class="double">&quot;No...thank you,&quot; said the tech, accepting the container as his dazed expression faded. &quot;Yes. Well. That&#039;s done. You can return to your normal duties.&quot; He marched toward a bank of turbolifts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, sir. Come along,&quot; she gestured to her counterpart, and the two droids made their way to the recharge/monitor station.</p><p class="double">Once assured of some privacy, Sweetie triggered her comlink to send the all-clear.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Darth Vader strode toward the barabel, red lightsaber blade humming. Before he could say anything, Spike casually pre-empted, “Hello, Anakin. You’re looking well.”</p><p class="double">Slightly nonplussed, Vader stopped his advance. “I’ve been waiting for you Spikey-one. We meet again at last. The circle is now complete…” he began.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah. Master...learner...Now you’re the master. Who writes your material? You weren’t this stuffy during the Clone Wars,” commented Spike, idly igniting his own lightsaber.</p><p class="double">It wasn’t Obi-wan’s blue lightsaber from this or any previous loop, nor was it the purple saberstaff he’d built before the Jedi Civil War when he fought at Revan’s side.</p><p class="double">This was a wedding present. The blade cycled through pink to orange to yellow to blue to violet and back to pink. At the core of the blade was a constant silver-white beam. <i>I don’t know how or when Pinkie found the time to have this made, but it’s a magnificent gift.</i></p><p class="double">The Sith Lord actually took a half-step backward when he saw the scintillating blade. Rallying, he made a cut toward Spike’s head that was easily turned aside. Spike’s riposte was similarly warded off. A series of probing attacks from each ended with Spike retreating toward the hangar bay door, just as he wanted.</p><p class="double">“Your powers are weak, old man,” taunted Vader.</p><p class="double">Spike barked a laugh in response. “In your dreams. I’m probably supposed to say something about if you strike me down, I’ll become more powerful than you can imagine. But I’m already there.” He flicked his left wrist and a second lightsaber appeared, igniting with a green blade. He used Vader’s moment of surprise to apply a touch of growth magic to himself and shifted to two-and-a-half meters in height with proportional increase in body mass. He was also visibly more draconic in appearance.</p><p class="double">Darth Vader was clearly having a bad feeling about all this.</p><p class="double">Trying to shake off his surprise, he launched into a flurry of attacks, but Spike’s defenses were more than up to the challenge.</p><p class="double">The significant disadvantage of dual lightsaber technique is the supposed inability of a blade held in one hand to resist a heavy blow from an opponent using a single blade in a two-handed grip.</p><p class="double">Spike’s greater bulk and raw strength belied that notion.</p><p class="double">The power of the Sith Lord’s two-handed strikes were countered by the large reptilian’s own amplified strength. The need to stay aware of the jedi’s second lightsaber which lashed out from unexpected angles quickly put Vader on the defensive.</p><p class="double">Spotting the rest of the party making their run for the <i>Falcon</i>, Spike ostentatiously caught Vader’s blade in a bind and sent it flying with a slice through both wrists. A short burst of intense green flame from his mouth caught the falling weapon, making it vanish in a puff of smoke and a shower of sparkles.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am truly sorry I had to do that, Anakin. I don&#039;t want to hurt you any more. Please believe me. I won&#039;t tell you to break free of the Palpatine&#039;s influence, because you already know, deep down, that&#039;s what you need to do to find peace for yourself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Leaving the Dark Lord of the Sith staring at the smoking machinery of his wrists, Spike started walking toward the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>. “The Force will be with you, Anakin, if you allow it.”</p><p class="double">The squad of stormtroopers blocking his path raised their weapons. He raised an eyeridge in response. “Seriously? Were you paying any attention to the past few minutes?”</p><p class="double">The leader’s voice filtered through the helmet. “Fire!”</p><p class="double">The squad was scattered around the hangar bay to be pinned against the bulkheads by the combined efforts of three Jedi masters. The single blaster bolt that ventured near the dragon was contemptuously swatted into the deck.</p><p class="double">Joining his companions at the foot of the boarding ramp, he restored himself to his previous size and shape, nodding thanks to Luke and Twilight. He turned to examine Cadance. &quot;No offense, but I don&#039;t think that look works for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">The princess shrugged. &quot;We couldn&#039;t find a salon or stylist anywhere in this place. What&#039;s a mare to do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps it&#039;s time we left?&quot; suggested Luke.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>77.1 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Chrysalis quickly found herself cursing Fluttershy&#039;s timid nature – one she had to live up to.</p><p class="double">She had only her pre-awakening self to blame, of course. Her logic had been that a recluse was much less likely to slip and give herself away – so timid, self-effacing and quiet she had been.</p><p class="double">And now, now that she was heading into a forest that was quite possibly cursed to confront a being as powerful as herself – if not more so – with five reasonably skilled but inexperienced ponies by her side... she was handicapped by her own pre-awake preferences. She couldn&#039;t give orders, letting them use their skills to the best advantage. She couldn&#039;t fly at the front of the group, at least making sure that she would be the first to encounter danger.</p><p class="double">And she certainly couldn&#039;t fly up into the air to scout out the forest. Which led to <i>this</i> mess.</p><p>“Sorry...” she said, wincing. “I think we took a wrong turn.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s nothin&#039;,” Applejack assured her, appraising the cliff they were at the top of. “We kin just find a way around. Looks like-”</p><p class="double">The disguised changeling sensed something malicious, moving very quickly towards them. She turned towards the source-</p><p class="double">There was a crack-<i>boom</i> noise, and the ground fell away beneath them.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis leapt for the air on instinct, before she could even <i>think</i> about maintaining her assumed persona, and breathed a sign of relief when no flare of surprise-suspicion followed. Then she saw that Twilight had just been convinced to let go of Applejack, and caught by Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been too busy panicking to help.</p><p class="double"><i>Some protector I am.</p><p class="double"></i>Landing gently on butter-coloured wings, she shook her head. <i>I&#039;ll do better this time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>There was a snarl, and a manticore pounced on the group.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis skipped back out of the way, then concentrated. <i>What is it that Fluttershy does times like this... right.</p><p class="double"></i>She looked directly at the manticore, and drew in a breath. At the same time, she carefully measured out some of her hoarded power from before Awakening, and shaped a strong mental suggestion.</p><p class="double"><i>“</i><i>Stop! Sit! Bad manticore!”</p><p class="double"></i>Her voice bounced off the nearby trees, making not just the manticore but all five ponies freeze exactly where they were.</p><p class="double">She walked closer, still keeping up the <i>Suggestion.</i> The animal was enraged, but beneath that there was something else... pain.</p><p class="double">The tricky thing was that she had no idea where the pain was coming <i>from</i>. And that <i>Suggestion</i> wouldn&#039;t hold for long, whereas she had no desire to hold a pained animal in place or simply disable it, leaving it to suffer.</p><p class="double">The easiest and least cruel solution was to- <i>“Sleep.”</p><p class="double"></i>With a yawn and a thud, the manticore fell over and began snoring.</p><p class="double">Time pressure gone, Chrysalis looked for anything obvious that might be causing the pain. It didn&#039;t take long to find it – a wicked-looking thorn that seemed to throb with malice.</p><p class="double">“That was awesome!” Rainbow Dash enthused.</p><p class="double">“Oh, er...” Chrysalis turned, letting her mane flop over one eye and discarding the thorn. “It was nothing.”</p><p class="double">The others were giving her looks that ranged from scared to bewildered. Thinking back, she <i>had</i> just shouted down a manticore...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they finally reached the room with the Elements in, Chrysalis was almost seething at her own inability to contribute.</p><p class="double">The next thing they&#039;d run into had been a grove of trees enchanted to cause fear. With her empathic senses fully open and straining to detect her foe, Chrysalis had been rendered almost unconscious by the powerful artificial emotion, and hadn&#039;t even recovered by the time Pinkie dispelled it with an expert heartsong.</p><p class="double">That had been... humiliating. She was supposed to be a ruler. Supposed to be <i>keeping these ponies safe.</i> But she&#039;d been reduced to a heap on the floor by a parlour trick.</p><p class="double">The river serpent had been a little more like what she was ready for, but it hadn&#039;t even developed into a fight. Rarity had defused the situation in moments, leaving the Changeling Queen impressed but confused.</p><p class="double">And as for the bridge... there had definitely been <i>something</i> in the mist, but despite the knowledge that Rainbow Dash might be in danger, Chrysalis had been unable to justify leaving the others defenceless. It wouldn&#039;t do any good to go and help Dash if doing so had allowed Nightmare Moon to attack – possibly even kill – Twilight, Applejack, Rarity and Pinkie.</p><p class="double">But here they were, and Nightmare Moon was – if Chrysalis had all this right – just about to turn up. As subtly as possible, she began to ready herself for the fight.</p><p class="double">As soon as her opponent was a viable target, she would have to drop her shapeshift. That should earn her at least a moments&#039; distraction, letting her achieve an alpha-strike – a wave of magical energy as powerful as she could make it – and then set up a shield to convert Dark attacks into something more usable.</p><p class="double">What happened then was... uncertain. But she&#039;d have as good a chance as she could manage. And, hopefully, she could try and pierce the layers of mental transformation to free Luna. Somehow.</p><p><i>I hate working from rumors and half-truths and stories told by drunk fellow loopers about how they beat up Nightmare Moon!</p><p class="double">I miss the hive.</p><p class="double"></i>Chrysalis bit her lip. <i>I miss Trixie.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>Infuriatingly (the kind of infuriation which made her double-check that she wasn&#039;t starting to exert empathic influence on the ponies around her) Nightmare Moon didn&#039;t even attack as a solid. Instead, she poured into the chamber as a cloud of dust, congealed around Twilight – who was too focused on her task to notice – and vanished in a teleport.</p><p class="double">“Twilight!”</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d she go?” Applejack asked, looking around. “Darn it!”</p><p class="double">“This way,” Chrysalis replied, half her focus on tracking the mental &#039;glows&#039; of the unicorn and alicorn. “Follow me.”</p><p class="double">That got her some strange looks, but she barely noticed. Nightmare Moon <i>had</i> to be solid by now.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they cantered into the room, Chrysalis saw a pile of glittering jewel-dust remnants lying around Twilight.</p><p class="double">The unicorn was finishing some kind of speech. “...my friends!”</p><p class="double">She made a gesture, which took in all five of them. Chrysalis didn&#039;t pay any attention, intent on the precise moment she would drop her shift and attack. Just a moment&#039;s surprise or inattention on the Nightmare&#039;s part would be sufficient...</p><p class="double">“Applejack, who told me I was safe and got through my panic, represents the Element of Honesty! Fluttershy, who guided us through the forest and calmed the Manticore, represents the Element of Kindness! Pinkie-”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; concentration fell apart in tatters, as she noticed that one of the streams of jewel-dust was orbiting her. <i>But... I&#039;m not Fluttershy. How...</p><p class="double"></i>A soothing warmth began to build around her. With a flash of green light, the gems coalesced into a silvery necklace with an emerald heart-device.</p><p class="double">Then everything went rainbow.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis stirred. “What... what just...”</p><p class="double">She saw Twilight looking at her. The purple unicorn had her Magic tiara neatly atop her head, but seemed more interested in her than in the unconscious and cured Princess Luna on the other side of the room. She was also ignoring the four still-asleep members of the Elements, lying to either side.</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Chrysalis asked, looking down – and her heart nearly stopped.</p><p class="double">Black chitin. Hooves with holes in them.</p><p class="double">Her shapeshift had dropped.</p><p class="double">“I swear, this isn&#039;t what...” she began, nervously, then sighed. “Okay, that&#039;s just a flat lie. It <i>is</i> what it looks like.”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave her a closer look, focusing particularly on her Element. “Huh. This hasn&#039;t happened before...”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. “I did not expect<i> that</i>... reaction...”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s emotions were <i>confused/interested/melancholy?</i> Why would she be...</p><p class="double">“...oh, you have <i>got</i> to be kidding me.” Chrysalis closed her eyes, counted to three, then opened them again. “You&#039;re Awake, aren&#039;t you.”</p><p class="double">An explosion of <i>shock/surprise/relief</i> greeted that statement. “<i>You&#039;re</i> Awake?” Twilight asked, carefully. “Have we both been playing along with our in-loop roles?”</p><p class="double">“Looks like.” Chrysalis shook her head.</p><p class="double">“We just spent the last day or so repeatedly missing one another, didn&#039;t we.” Twilight let out a sigh, then a chuckle. “That would have made things a lot simpler...”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re telling me. I spent the whole time here trying to keep you lot safe, and now it turns out I might as well not have bothered.”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “No, it <i>was</i> worthwhile. Just because it wasn&#039;t necessary doesn&#039;t mean it was a bad idea.”</p><p class="double">“Sure, sure.” Chrysalis peered at Twilight again, noting that the unicorn had a sense of deliberation about her thoughts – clearly choosing her words carefully. “Did you only just Awaken?”</p><p class="double">“No, same time as usual.” Twilight looked confused for a moment, then her face brightened in realization. “Oh, I see. You&#039;re confused because... no, I was going along with the baseline. I had plans to troll Discord, see, and if I&#039;m going to do that I have to be pretty much baseline until then. It&#039;s why I did a ping – did you miss it?” Twilight shrugged. “That said, I&#039;m not surprised that you couldn&#039;t tell I was Awake, I&#039;m a very good actor by now.”</p><p class="double">“Apparently,” Chrysalis muttered. “I must have missed the ping, I was kind of panicking when I Awoke.”</p><p class="double">“To be honest, I thought you – well, Fluttershy, or whatever, was some kind of variant with more anger issues. A lot of anger issues.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn mare tossed her head, grinning. “I was doubly interested in how it&#039;d play out if you – er, she – had the same encounter with Discord as normal.” As she spoke, Twilight trotted over to the recumbent Princess Luna – stepping carefully over an unconscious Rarity - and cast a diagnostic spell. “Same as usual. Always good to check.”</p><p class="double">“Right. I think.” The Changeling... well, Princess... rubbed her forehead, then tapped her new item of jewellery. It clinked. “So how come I&#039;ve got... this?”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned back to her, beaming. “Well, you <i>were</i> taking Fluttershy&#039;s place, you <i>did</i> handle the Manticore – and if I heard you right, you were also planning on keeping <i>all</i> of us safe.”</p><p class="double">“I wasn&#039;t doing very well,” Chrysalis castigated herself. “I did have a vague plan to cure Luna – somehow – but... no, it wasn&#039;t anything like a proper plan. I was just going to <i>try</i> and help her, though... because if I didn&#039;t, what chance was there left?”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight nodded. “Thinking of the others – even Luna – before yourself... working to reduce suffering, and focusing on the problems that can be solved first... it might not be quite like Fluttershy does it, but you&#039;ve earned an Element of Kindness. Congratulations.”</p><p class="double">“Seriously?” Chrysalis looked down at the necklace, noting how it fit her current form rather better than it did &#039;Fluttershy&#039;. “I... yeah, wow.”</p><p class="double">“I know.” The bearer of Magic trotted over and laid a hoof on her shoulder. “It&#039;s a lot to take in. But you <i>do</i> deserve it, Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">With a bright flash of sunlight, Princess Celestia materialized in one corner of the room. “My faithful student! Good – wait, is that a Changeling?”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked over at Celestia. “Yes.”</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked. “...okay, er... why is there a changeling in here?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s the Element of Kindness,” Twilight replied matter-of-factly.</p><p class="double">“...right.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis couldn&#039;t help but snigger.</p><p class="double"><hr> </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

I am sure fraulein Rarity has a truly expansive wardrobe for the photographing, ja?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I <i>do</i>,” Rarity said, slowly. “But... I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s my place to...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, don&#039;t worry.” With a flash of green fire, Chrysalis turned her coat a dusky red. “What about this for the autumn range?”</p><p class="double">Photo Finish stood stock still for a few seconds. Then shook her head. “I go!” And ran off.</p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>dear</i>,” Rarity winced. “Are you sure that was wise, er, Chrysalis?”</p><p class="double">The current Element of Kindness shrugged. “Whatever else she was, she wasn&#039;t afraid. In fact-”</p><p class="double">With a blur of motion, Photo Finish skidded back into view with three large cameras. “Oh, this will be ausgezeichnet! Can you do the, the horn as well?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. “Yep.”</p><p class="double">“Marvellous!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was an awful risk you took for me,” Rarity started, some hours later. (Photography was over for the day, but Finish had insisted on coming back for at least the next two weeks to sample <i>everything</i> in Rarity&#039;s wardrobes.) “I mean, I&#039;m grateful, of course I am, but...”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shook her head, flashing back to her base-form for the loop. “Seriously, Rarity, it isn&#039;t a problem at all. I may be nervous around cameras, but I can do this for you. We&#039;re friends, after all,” she added in a tone of slight wonderment.</p><p class="double">“Well, yes,” Rarity admitted. “But-”</p><p class="double">“No, really.” Chrysalis&#039; mouth quirked up at the corners. “Hay, maybe I could see if we can get you in a few of the shoots?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Smoothly done,” Twilight complimented her later that night.</p><p class="double">“Thanks.” Chrysalis dispelled her shapeshift, and examined her silver-and-green Kindness element. “I&#039;m <i>still</i> coming to terms with this thing. Not sure I&#039;ve got the hang of it yet.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re doing fine,” Twilight assured her. “If you need help or advice, just ask.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.2 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double">Spike found a diary.</p><p class="double">He wasn&#039;t Awake, so he couldn&#039;t resist. He opened the last written page.</p><p class="double">It was old and yellowed and full of of protection spells As far as he could see it was an ancient Book, easily measuring it&#039;s age in the thousands of years, still the last entry&#039;s ink was fresh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Attempt 1528 Lyra during the Discord Award Ceremony.</p><p>Suggestions: Remove Lyra with influenza.

Why is your friend Twilight Sparkle wearing a giant chicken suit?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked mightily sheepish.(&quot;No offense Woolma.&quot; &quot;None taken.&quot;) &quot;Well, actually I never asked.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You never asked? Does this mean she often wears a giant chicken suit?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, actually she ALWAYS wears a giant chicken suit.&quot; Maud Pie looked at Pinkie in absolute disbelief. Pinkie never saw her that astonished. Her left eyebrow rose <i>four hundred micrometers</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, that is strange, even for you. I will ask.&quot; really, she never asked?</p><p class="double">Maud walked over to Twilight and asked:&quot;Why are...&quot; was as far as she came before Rainbow Dash snapped her up and flew away.</p><p class="double">The Elements minus Twilight assembled around Maud. Rarity began. &quot;Maud, dear, we do NOT ask Twilight about the chicken suit.&quot;</p><p class="double">Maud&#039;s eyebrow shot up another twenty μms: &quot;Why?&quot; She asked exasperatedly. Not that anyone noticed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Believe us, we tried. We tried asking for years, but it never worked out and only got more and more awkward and dangerous.&quot; Applejack explained.</p><p class="double">Maud was speechless. Almost: &quot;Dangerous?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because&quot;, Rainbow started, &quot;every time we so much as try to ask her something extremely awkward or terrible happened. The very first time someone tried to ask her Princess Celestia was kidnapped and her crazed sister tried to kill everypony by bringing about eternal night. After we defeated her without asking about the chicken suit it was really awkward to bring it up. When I finally ponied up and went to ask her a stampede was coming right at the town and only narrowly averted. When Pinkie tried to ask next, another stampede, <i>this time made of bunnies</i> devastated the town. Then an outsider tried to ask about it and a huge glowy bear rampaged through town. When my friend, a griffon, came to town and was about to ask a huge red Dragon came storming into Ponyville, demanding we give him his hoard back. A Zebra nearly managed to get the words out and we all ended up being poisoned. Then Parasprites invaded the town, the next time diamond dogs kidnapped somepony. Finally at the Grand Galloping Gala a mare exclaimed her outrage when she saw Twilight wearing a beautiful dress over her chicken suit. Before she could say the word &quot;chicken&quot; however an animal stampede ripped the Gala apart and Discord broke free of his prison.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy put in her two cents: &quot;Since then we tried to run interference and apart from one incident with Spike destroying half the town when Cheerilee couldn&#039;t contain her curiosity our lives have gotten a lot quieter.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie took Maud&#039;s head in her hooves. &quot;So please sis, don&#039;t ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">Madness. Still Pinkie Pie was seldom so serious. &quot;Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had been so long. They had to know. They took Twilight to a remote location and secured it against EVERYTHING.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot;, The Elements spoke, &quot;why are you wearing a Giant Chicken Suit?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The world ended. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.1 continued (earlier)</p><p class="double">“Can any pony match Trixie&#039;s skill?” Trixie Lulamoon asked, laughing. “<i>Anything</i> you can do, I can do better!”</p><p class="double">“I can,” a pale pegasus volunteered.</p><p class="double">“Ah, a new challenger!” Trixie announced. “What are you called?”</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy,” the pegasus replied, and took a fluttering hop up onto the stage. “And I... I&#039;m psychic. I can tell what ponies are thinking.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>really?</i>” Trixie nodded to herself. “Well, then, what am I thinking?”</p><p class="double">“That I&#039;m making it up,” Fluttershy said promptly. “Well, now, shock, and an undercurrent of fear... and you&#039;re wondering how I&#039;m doing it. No, it&#039;s not that way, I really am psychic. That moon-and-star blanket of yours looks cute, by the way.”</p><p class="double">Trixie flushed. “H-how did you know about that!?”</p><p class="double">The pegasus tapped her forehead. “I <i>said</i> I was psychic.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn shook her head, pulling herself together. “Well, Trixie is impressed. But she can tell exactly what you are thinking without even looking!”</p><p class="double">There was a loud bang, as a delayed-action fireworks spell triggered.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re startled!” Trixie said quickly.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smoothed her ruffled feathers. “That wasn&#039;t very nice... okay, I&#039;m going to make a prediction, and then I&#039;ll go.”</p><p class="double">She passed over a piece of paper. “This prediction will come true later.”</p><p class="double">As the pegasus left the stage, Trixie curiously unfolded the paper.</p><p class="double"><i>You will be at the Corner Cafe, the one run by Cozy Corner, at seven fifteen this evening.</p><p class="double">My treat.</p><p class="double"></i>Trixie blinked, and felt her eyes widen. Then she hastily swept off her hat and stuffed the paper into it. “Aherm. Now, where was Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“On stage!” a pink pony said brightly.</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” she replied absently.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So...” Trixie said, awkwardly. “Why did you invite Trixie to dinner?”</p><p class="double">The pegasus sitting across the table from her nibbled on a breadstick. “I like what I feel of you.”</p><p class="double">“...that&#039;s not cryptic at all,” Trixie replied, picking up a stick of celery. “Why is this red?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, they put it in flavoured water,” Fluttershy replied. “The water goes up the capillaries. Try it.”</p><p class="double">Trixie did so, crunching off the end of the stick. Her eyes widened. “This is <i>great!</i>”</p><p class="double">“I thought you&#039;d like it,” her companion replied.</p><p class="double">“More of your psychic powers?” Trixie asked, chewing.</p><p class="double">“I knew as if I&#039;d seen you eat here before.”</p><p class="double">“Well... thanks.” Trixie swallowed. “I don&#039;t always have the chance to eat a good meal, out on the road.”</p><p class="double">“I know.” Fluttershy nodded.</p><p class="double">Trixie chuckled. “You seem to know everything about Trixie.”</p><p class="double">“Most things.”</p><p class="double">There was a clatter of hooves outside.</p><p class="double">“Miss Trixie!” two young voices said, on top of one another.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned. “Oh, Trixie&#039;s fans. What is it?”</p><p class="double">“We awoke an Ursa,” Snips said.</p><p class="double">“So you can banish it!” Snails continued.</p><p class="double">“And show how great you really are!” they finished together.</p><p class="double">Trixie blanched.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy got up from the table, and stepped around to face the colts. “That was a very bad idea! That poor Ursa – imagine how you would feel if someone woke <i>you</i> up from a sleep just to get beaten up!”</p><p class="double">“But...” Trixie said, distantly. “I... I can&#039;t-”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy turned to her, and gave her an encouraging smile. “Don&#039;t worry. I&#039;ll deal with it – but I&#039;ll need your help.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>I seriously hope this works,</i> Chrysalis thought to herself.</p><p class="double">As the young star-beast entered town, growling, she stepped forward and focused. <i>“Stop!”</p><p class="double"></i>The Ursa ground to a halt, gaze fixed on her, and roared.</p><p class="double">“I know you&#039;re scared,” she added in a soothing voice. “Those silly colts woke you up, didn&#039;t they? But they&#039;re gone now. You just need to calm down, and <i>Sleep</i>. Go back to <i>Sleep.</i>”</p><p class="double">The threatening growls gave way to confused, drowsy rumblings.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right, no-pony here wants to hurt you,” she said, preparing a fourth Suggestion spell. “Just <i>Go Back To Sleep</i>, and you&#039;ll be home in a jiffy.”</p><p class="double">The last rumble turned into a snore, and the Ursa&#039;s eyes closed. Then it slowly began to fall forwards.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis turned to Trixie. “Catch it – quick!”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s horn flashed into light, and a matching blue glow caught the Ursa before it hit the ground. “There!”</p><p class="double">“Good work,” Chrysalis said. “Now, we need to get him back to his mother.”</p><p class="double">“Mother?” several ponies repeated.</p><p class="double">“Quietly!” Chrysalis hissed. “He&#039;s only asleep, remember? Now, come on. I can&#039;t carry him, Trixie – can you lift this much weight for that long?”</p><p class="double">Trixie frowned. “I can try.”</p><p class="double">“Good. Follow me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Nicely done,” Twilight said the next morning. “Did you-”</p><p class="double">“Yes, she knows I&#039;m a Changeling,” Chrysalis replied. “”I told her on the way back. She took it well, actually. And I told her to keep in touch.”</p><p class="double">“You know that, if she doesn&#039;t ultimately love you, it&#039;s not the looping her...” Twilight checked.</p><p class="double">“Of course I do, I&#039;m not a fool.” Chrysalis looked down. “But if she <i>can</i>... or even if I give her a happier life... then I should try.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.4 (TheEyes)</p><p class="double">Nurse Redheart walked over to Twilight&#039;s bed and looked at her clipboard on the door, &quot;According to these charts...she&#039;s...going through her Changeling phase.&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia gasped...then blinked in confusion, &quot;Wait, WHAT?&quot;</p><p class="double">Redheart set down the clipboard and looked the sun pony in the eyes, &quot;Apparently it has to do with her connection to the Elements of Harmony. Her body is channeling the magic of friendship and she will eventually Ascend... after cycling through every sentient species on Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">The nurse slid open the door, where Twilight lay in bed. About the only thing recognizable about her was her mane, with its familiar purple-and-pink-highlights, the rest of her was covered in black chitinous plates. The apparently-a-Changeling-now waved.</p><p class="double">Celestia waved back, her ethereal mane looking uncharacteristically ruffled. &quot;...what?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked down at her purple dragon body. &quot;Huh. Well, on the plus side, I guess I can do more hands-on research into postal magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia winced as a lean, rainbow-colored dragon sped through the sky, blowing up clouds with bursts of fire breath. <i>Perhaps now would be a good time to reconsider the brandy content of my morning tea.</i> She glanced towards Sugarcube Corner, where a pink dragon was breathing what looked like cotton candy at random passers-by and giggling madly. <i>Yes, definitely brandy.</i></p><p class="double">Spike stared slack-jawed at a lithe white dragon with iridescent lavender scales, smirking back at him with lidded eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am TOTALLY FINE with this change!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Shoo bee doo, Princess Celestia!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eye twitched.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lyra Heartstrings bounced in excitement &quot;Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stumbled on unsteady legs and fell, catching herself by wrapping her arms around Lyra&#039;s flank. Lyra didn&#039;t seem to mind one bit.</p><p class="double">&quot;OHMYGOSH!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia sighed in relief. Her mane was a frazzled mess, and she hadn&#039;t drank any tea with her morning brandy in weeks, but today was the day it all ended. Two months of bizarre shape changes, strange inexplicable powers, and chaotic interspecies mood swings were finally over, at least according to Twilight&#039;s research notes and Nurse Redheart&#039;s tests. Today Twilight and her friends would Ascend, and all this weirdness would be over.</p><p class="double">Six tentacled manticores stood in a circle under her watchful (and slightly bloodshot) eyes. Slowly they began to glow, the now-familiar sign of transformation shifting brighter than ever before...</p><p class="double">...and faded, leaving six draconequui standing, blinking at each other.</p><p class="double">There was the distinct sound of glass breaking, or perhaps that was the sound of a mind shattering, and Princess Celestia fell stiffly to one side, twitching occasionally. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.5 (Valentine Meikin)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stood in front of Nightmare Moon, glaring her down.</p><p class="double">&quot;Go to your room right now, and you&#039;re grounded until Celestia&#039;s back!&quot; She snapped, everyone looking shocked as Nightmare Moon actually bowed down and slinked off towards the library, &quot;And I want you to stop possessing her sister right now!&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone looked at her, and she just shrugged. &quot;She&#039;ll be fine. I&#039;ll get her some cookies on the way back to the library.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not that... You GROUNDED Nightmare Moon for attempting to create Eternal Night!&quot; Applejack explained.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked into the library a few hours later to see Nyx looking unhappy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Mummy, for creating the Eternal Night...&quot; The filly alicorn whined, for Twilight to smile at her, while thinking, &#039;<i>Yes, I just defeated Nightmare Moon by being her mother. Must get Fluttershy to specifically handle Discord... I don&#039;t understand why, but it works.&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i></p><p>In the palace, Celestia looked at Luna, who was wondering what the hell happened.</p><p class="double">&quot;All my hatred, anger and loathing just seemed to disappear... I don&#039;t know what came over me...&quot; Luna explained.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve all had bad time outs.&quot; Celestia muttered, as she glanced at the report, mentioning that Nyx was catching up on a millenia of no hugs and cookies from her mother, and was really sorry about her and her sister ganging up on her. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight penned a letter to Celestia as she got a message asking how she was able to claim to be the mother of the dark side of her sister, planning the most audacious act possible... She was going to tell her the complete and honest truth about how she was a Alicorn Time Looper whose daughter was the embodiment of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Celestia, The being you know as Nightmare Moon is actually my daughter, Nyx Spa...&quot; She began to write, then it screeched to a halt as she considered finishing that sentence, and called Nyx over, making a decision she knew she&#039;d never want to go back on.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, we know that you are born from what remained of the original Nightmare Moon and my own blood... For many loops, you&#039;ve just been, well, Nyx.&quot; Twilight stated, before asking, hopefully, &quot;I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;d like it, but I was thinking that Nyx Sparkle sounds much....&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly shaped missile that hit her, saying that she&#039;d love to be considered properly a Sparkle, was a surprise... but, as she continued the letter, running a hoof over Nyx&#039;s mane, she knew that it was the best idea possible. No more would Nyx&#039;s full name be Nightmare Moon, now she could say her full name was Nyx Sparkle...</p><p class="double">Nyx sniffled, then turned her head upwards. “Wait. We don&#039;t use family names, do we?”</p><p class="double">“Sometimes we do, sometimes we don&#039;t.” Twilight smiled. “If you want to take part of my name, go right ahead.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.6 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Behold,&quot; shouted Nightmare Moon as she appeared in the Palace&#039;s Throne room, a magical spell already primed and armed. &quot;<i>Dear Sister</i>, I have returned from my thousand...year...slumber.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her voice trailed off and the spell flickered out as a Draconequus Celestia sat in a plaid throne room with mushroom clouds hovering in the rafters made of cotton candy. Celestia blinked. &quot;Welcome back, Luna. I know you want to fight it out, get revenge and all that, but maybe we could just talk it out? Would you like to sample some of the cheesecake,&quot; she said, bringing out a cake made entirely of cheese and icing, &quot;while the therapist I hired works us through our problems?&quot;</p><p class="double">The throne doors made of Jello squirt open, revealing a pink Draconequus. &quot;Hi there, Black Snooty! Oh wait, you&#039;re Celestia&#039;s sister...Nyx right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare shook her head several times to clear the distractions. &quot;Sister? What hast thou done? Didst thy vile foe, Discord, free himself and wreck havoc upon Equestria whilst I slept?&quot;</p><p class="double">More confused glances. &quot;Are you feeling alright, Luna? You seem...ill? Discord is still imprisoned in the gardens.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare&#039;s horn glowed navy blue once again. &quot;I wilst not fall for thou tricks. Thou art Draconequui, and mine sworn foe! Return mine palace to the way it was long ago, and dispell thine strange confections I see before mine self!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia and the pink Draconequus looked at each other. &quot;Maybe she needs to see the happy ponies in white? Captain Armor, send for Sound Mind and his team immediately!&quot;</p><p class="double">Another Draconequus appeared seconds later from the doorway, gave a salute, and turned to walk out. Nightmare fired off a bolt at the captain, who merely raised his shield and deflected it. Then, weird things started happening to the dark alicorn. First her front hooves morphed into a griffon claw and lion&#039;s paw. She stared on in horror as her lower hooves took the shape of an eagle&#039;s talon and a goat leg. Her body shed all its fur and took the scales of a dragon, her tail now that of a snake, her wings were that of a bat and pegasus and her horn disappeared, replaced with moose antler and a goat horn. She felt herself all over and started screaming.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After a few minutes of hysteric screaming, Twilight Sparkle emerged from hiding behind the throne and cast a sleep spell on the exiled princess, mercifully sent Nightmare Moon into a deep sleep. Celestia sighed. &quot;As always, Twilight, your magic is impressive. But the perception filter was a bit too powerful. What did you make her see anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight was at least sheepish at what she had done. She pulled out a photo from her scrapbook and floated it to Celestia. It depicted Celestia and the element bearers as draconequus all standing upside down on the Canterlot Palace, where everyone had been draconequus and Discord (there named Harmony) had been sealed in a statue for trying to ruin their chaotic fun times.</p><p class="double">Celestia giggled for a second, then asked, &quot;Mind if I take a copy?&quot; She was totally planning on using this as blackmail against Discord.</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. &quot;Sure.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.7 (Elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">&quot;Mom, why are we clownfish?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have no idea, Nyx. Let&#039;s play along, I&#039;m not sure how to do magic yet with this body.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight swam around, in a half state of panic. Straining again, she manifested her Element. Sure enough, the tiara appeared. Like the last half dozen attempts, this was followed immediately by a vexing beep that reminded her of one of the default alerts on a computer from the Hub, and the crown simply Ceased to Be. Items from her pocket had been met with a similar response.</p><p class="double">She groaned in frustration once again.</p><p class="double">Why had Nyx even swum out there? The “Butt” was clearly an excursion boat, which meant divers, and potentially poachers were about. Those other fish were clearly the loop&#039;s version of Babs Seed, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, each with relatively baseline personalities. Why hadn&#039;t she, Twilight Sparkle, Anchor and Archmage, noticed the developing situation until after the fact?</p><p class="double">A deep breath. Calm down Twi, self-recrimination will not get Nyx back.</p><p class="double">Baseline capabilities were not enough to beat this. She needed assets, she needed allies.</p><p class="double">Twilight perked up at that thought.</p><p class="double">She needed her friends.</p><p class="double">The plan was simple. Assemble her friends, as many of the others as she could. A ping at the beginning had returned results, so there were others around. And if those resources proved insufficient to effect a <i>rescue</i>, start building power among the loop&#039;s unawake inhabitants and mount an amphibious assault on humanity until they gave her back her daughter.</p><p class="double">Even if she couldn&#039;t use them, she could still feel the Elements.</p><p class="double">So, she started swimming. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.8 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, next thing you&#039;ll tell me is that Princess Celestia can walk on water.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She can, actually. If she wanted to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, o&#039;course she can, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a spell for that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, but she doesn&#039;t need it. You know how clouds are water vapor? She can just manually overcharge her pegasus cloud walking ability, and trot across a pond. With enough training, some pegasi could learn it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really now? &#039;Suppose you could do it too, overcharge&#039;n that cloudwalking spell o&#039; yours?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no, not that spell. I mean, I <i>could</i>, but the spell matrix wouldn&#039;t work like that. Spell structure is too rigid for that. You&#039;d have to put so much power into it, to make it work, that you&#039;d be much better off with an actual waterwalking spell.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.9 (TheCentauress)</p><p class="double">&quot;And now, my little.... Wait a tick, Why <i>aren&#039;t </i>you ponies?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<u><i><b>FIRE!</b></i></u>&quot;</p><p class="double">As the smoke cleared, the Dracoequui Elements blinked. Where once stood the serpentine figure of Chaos, there was a whipcord-lean pegasus Stallion of Celestia&#039;s stature with a cutie mark of an irregular hunk of crystal containing a swirled rainbow pattern. The stallion unfurled his wings, showing that the left one was a royal-looking swanlike feathered appendage, while the other was one that was more fitting for a member of the Night Guard.</p><p class="double">The changed Spirit of Entropy looked down, then whined;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tiiiiiiiiiiiiia!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.1 continued</p><p class="double">“Miss Chrysalis?” three voices asked, not quite in chorus.</p><p class="double">The no-longer-even-bothering-with-a-disguise Changeling turned. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well... we&#039;re trying to get our cutie marks,” Applebloom began.</p><p class="double">“And we thought we&#039;d get one for Hearts and Hooves day,” Scootaloo continued.</p><p class="double">“And our teacher doesn&#039;t have a special somepony, so we thought you could help,” Sweetie Belle took up the thread.</p><p class="double">“Who does Miss Cheerilee like?” they asked in unison.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shook her head, grinning. “Yeah, no, not a good idea.”</p><p class="double">“Why?” Applebloom retorted. “It&#039;s a great idea! Like that princess... you know, the one whose got a love talent!”</p><p class="double">“She had an article in the Canterlot Times last week!” Sweetie said. “It was great, but a bit mushy.”</p><p class="double">“Princess Cadence?” Chrysalis frowned, as the reminder hit home. She needed to work out what to do about that.</p><p class="double">But for now, she had a thankfully simple solution to this particular problem. “Your teacher doesn&#039;t want to find a special somepony right now, girls. I&#039;ll ask her, to make sure, but I think she&#039;s happy as she is. And so is your brother, Applebloom.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom jumped.</p><p class="double">“Now, I do know how you can check to see if you <i>could</i> get cutie marks for it,” Chrysalis continued. Then weighed the pros and cons of what she was about to do.</p><p class="double"><i>Buzz it. I&#039;m the Element of Kindness, I can do this bark.</p><p class="double"></i>“Applebloom, you need to set up a special booth – over by Sugar Cube Corner, okay? Make it so it&#039;s concealed from people going past – so it&#039;s private. Scootaloo, I need you to go and pick up something from this address in Canterlot. It&#039;s a long way, and you&#039;ll be carrying a lot on the way back, so take your scooter. And Sweetie, learn this music.”</p><p class="double">All three of them blinked as an address, a bag of bits, several dozen planks of wood, a hammer, some nails, a complicated food order and a pile of sheet music landed between them all.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d that come from?” Scootaloo demanded.</p><p class="double">“Super secret Changeling powers,” Chrysalis replied glibly. “Now, hurry up!”</p><p class="double">Two of the three fillies shot off in different directions.</p><p class="double">“Now, you get to learning that music!” Chrysalis instructed. “When I tell you, go hide in a bush near where Applebloom&#039;s going to have built the booth, and get singing.”</p><p class="double">“What are you gonna do, Miss Chrysalis?” Sweetie asked, already mouthing bits of the music to herself.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m going to go and deliver two tickets for free meals,” she said enigmatically, and trotted off.<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Alright, alright, I&#039;m here, like you said,” Cranky muttered. “Now, what&#039;s this about free-”</p><p class="double">“Cranky?” a voice interrupted him.</p><p class="double">The old donkey&#039;s head snapped up. “Matilda?”</p><p class="double">A gentle song started to float out of the air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">About a mile away, Chrysalis smiled as a pulse of incredulous joy rolled across her empathic sense.</p><p class="double"><i>One down. Now, if I got that just right...</p><p class="double"></i>The sound of three extremely happy fillies echoed off a nearby mountain.</p><p class="double">Sure, they weren&#039;t <i>Hearts and Hooves</i> cutie marks... but they probably had a heart in them somewhere.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.10 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Twilight Farkle sighed as she and her dragonling assistant Psych trotted into Ponyville. She&#039;d Woken Up with a cutie mark of dice, the student of Farcelestia, and a feeling that it was going to be one of <i>those</i> Loops.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Window Flash!

She had Awakened again! What kinds of fun would she have this loop? But wait! She wanted to prepare her newest model of Party Cannon to intercept Nightmare Moon on her way down from the moon and...</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Pinkie Pie, did you just Awaken?&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Chryssy, you too?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Keep your thoughts down!

Talon)</p><p class="double">He wasn&#039;t like any of the other humans who they had encountered through the Loops. He was tall, certainly, but with prematurely gray hair on a young face. He wore working boots, a long coat with obvious signs of Rarity&#039;s design work, and a gunbelt loaded with firearms and a retractable staff. And he had on a pair of spectacles that he adjusted as he sat in Twilight&#039;s library, keeping his tea in his slightly shaking hands.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you need anything? I mean, I can find sugar,&quot; Twilight said kindly. &quot;I mean, I can just conjure it now out of my subspace pocket-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, no,&quot; the visitor said. &quot;No, I-I&#039;m fine... I&#039;m fine...&quot; He sighed and rubbed his temple with his hand. Twilight tilted her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;So... Last time I saw you, you weren&#039;t an alicorn,&quot; he said. &quot;I-I mean... My Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, we know each other in the other universe?&quot; Twilight asked with a smile. The human chuckled a little, and nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... We&#039;re very, very good friends. Ahem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You act as though we&#039;re more than that,&quot; Twilight said, tilting her head back the other way. Princess Celestia had taught her just how to do it properly in order to convey several levels of meaning and to make oneself look too adorable to lie to. The human rubbed the back of his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;We are... Off and on. We have issues, we fight sometimes...&quot; He smiled. &quot;I love her to pieces, it&#039;s just not easy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Romance seldom is. I mean, unless it&#039;s in books... And I imagine that&#039;s why you might have some issues.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That and we&#039;re also dating Fluttershy,&quot; the human said. Twilight&#039;s eyebrows rose. The human coughed, and sipped his tea. &quot;It&#039;s... Complicated.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Twilight said, a bit amused. &quot;So... Frankly, this is a bit unusual. I mean, you&#039;re from an entirely different version of Equestria...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And here I thought I had crossed enough boundaries just being the first human in Equestria,&quot; the man chuckled. &quot;I feel like such an overachiever!&quot; He looked at her with a smile. &quot;So... What are the differences here? My world make first contact with yours in the distant past? Humans never showed up?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Humans do show up, regularly,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;But they tend to be Loopers.&quot;</p><p class="double">The human frowned, confused. &quot;Loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Time Loops,&quot; Twilight explained. &quot;You see, we&#039;re caught in eternal time loops. We&#039;re in a kind of... okay, reality consists of all universes, and dozens of timelines consisting of small subgroups of universes repeat over and over, with only a few aware of it at any time and able to take advantage of it. Seems to be a kind of system wide glitch in reality that they have yet to resolve-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But because of the time loops you have essentially an eternity to fix anything, so why not enjoy yourselves?&quot; The human concluded. Twilight smiled.</p><p class="double">&quot;I see why my counterpart likes you,&quot; she said gently. The human smiled back and shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;I do my best. Tends to end with me in the hospital, and her yelling at me... But we work out pretty well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still, while you&#039;re here,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;you could find ways to enjoy yourself. At least until we can send you home?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Home?&quot; The human smiled. &quot;Yeah... Yeah, home.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;That&#039;s what it is now...&quot; He nodded. &quot;All right. I&#039;ll be Bill Murray, you can be Andie MacDowell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This means you have to learn to play the piano and speak French, you know,&quot; Twilight said. At the gobsmacked look on the human&#039;s face, she giggled. &quot;I&#039;ve picked up a few things from various human pop culture references over the millennia.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Man, that is going to be hard to get used to,&quot; the human laughed. Twilight smiled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Might make it easier if I knew your real name?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Andrew.

Her eyes grew distant as she pondered this revelation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... AJ?&quot; Apple Bloom poked her sister. &quot;Are ya okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">It took a few seconds for the farm mare to do anything, but she did eventually paddle out of the watering hole, shake herself dry, and walk off without a word. They later found her rocking silently back and forth in the library. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.14 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">Twilight learned long ago to expect the unexpected, but there were just no preparation for this. Every window in Ponyville was smashed. Barnyard Bargains was in tatters. The building was on fire, every window was long since broken with electronic appliances scattered everywhere. Countless ponies surrounded the building, stamping on appliances shouting vile things about toasters and ovens. Off to the side, the Cutie Mark Crusaders were roasting marshmellows atop smaller, less dangerous wooden cinders and Fluttershy was running around in a draconequus outfit shouting for Discord.</p><p class="double">The unicorn mage turned to Pinkie, an unawake Pinkie, and said sternly, &quot;Explain!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked a bit sheepish, &quot;I was brainwashed by the toaster! And we are ridding the world of this evil.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord had something to do with this, she just knew. As Twilight forced a migraine down, she said, &quot;OK, start from the beginning.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, when a stallion and a mare love each other very much-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s hoof stopped Pinkie, &quot;I mean, the toaster.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it all started when my toaster spoke to me and demanded toast.&quot;</p><p class="double">At that, Twilight tuned out her long winded explanation, <i>Discord, </i>She thought, <i>Definitely.</i></p><p class="double">He wasn&#039;t awake either, but every now and then, an unawake Discord could prove difficult to predict. Unfortunately, no one was awake, so Twilight had to deal with this insanity on her own. She came back to the conversation just as Pinkie was finishing up, &quot;And Celestia freed us from our brainwashing by throwing the toaster out of Canterlot. We, the former Holy Order of Toast, thanked Celestia for her benevolence and vowed among ourselves to rid the world of all toasters and their great evil!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes, &quot;And why are you destroying the other appliances?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie returned the eye roll, &quot;Don&#039;t you know, silly filly, that the toasters are only the servants of the greater evil, electricity and all appliances! We will purify the world of its evil influence!&quot;</p><p class="double">One interesting thing about this world though, Pinkie was on medications. This was not Discord&#039;s fault alone, &quot;Pinkie, how about you come to your house with me and we&#039;ll help purify this great evil that has Ponyville in its grasp, what do you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gave one of her patented grins, &quot;That sounds nice, Twilight!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.15 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>999, Moonless age.

You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely, but you simply must get out of that dusty old tower.</p><p class="double">My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony&#039;s life than studying, so I&#039;ve asked Princess Celestia to have you supervise the preparations for this year&#039;s Summer Sun Celebration, in Ponyville. In addition, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some (more) friends!</p><p class="double">Your friend, Cadance.</p><p class="double">P.S. Why don&#039;t you take Nyx along? I&#039;m sure she&#039;d enjoy getting out of town for a couple days.&quot;</p><p class="double">Handing the letter back to Twilight, Nyx commented, &quot;That&#039;s a keeper, I think.&quot; She had Woken up a couple months ago, and had been enjoying her time as Twilight&#039;s little sister. &quot;Suppose the Cult is up to something? For real this time?&quot; Nyx asked her usual mother. &quot;Like, bigger than the bakesale last year.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sat beside her on the train. Spike was still in Canterlot, following an incident Nyx totally had nothing to do with, so it was just the two of them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hard to say, I keep expecting the other shoe to drop with them.&quot; The elder unicorn replied with a shrug. &quot;I&#039;m sure <i>something</i> is going to happen. You know how that goes. Try not to get kidnapped by a crazy cult, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean, besides your crazy cult?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Increased Moonpony ship sightings!

And much like she always was, an unAwake Pinkie gave them her physics defying gasp greeting... Though she likely wasn&#039;t Pinkie this time, on the grounds that she was lime green.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Right, green. We can handle this. Sweet Apple Acres to start, as usual, right?&quot; Nyx said, looking up at her mother.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunny Orange Orchards, actually.&quot; Twilight corrected. &quot;One of the butterflies Luna caused. Somewhat less worrying than Greenie Pie, or whatever her name is this time.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Taking a deep breath, Whiskey Sour continued introducing the Orange Family to them. &quot;...Rhode Red, Valencia Blossem, and Clementine. Up&#039;n&#039;attem, Clementine, we got guests.&quot;</p><p class="double">Taking note of their names this loop, Twilight leaned over and whispered to Nyx. &quot;You&#039;re helping me eat all this, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heck, Sugercube,&quot; Whiskey appearantly overheard her, and slapping her on the back told them, &quot;we got enough for everypony! Ya&#039;ll go on and eat your fill now, y&#039;hear?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, actually,&quot; Nyx answered Rarity&#039;s question, &quot;my sister is overseeing the preparations.&quot; Pointing at the groaning unicorn, who was leaning on the wall next to the door. &quot;But she&#039;s still recovering from our visit with the Oranges. Too many lemon tarts, and a lot of drinks they wouldn&#039;t let me have.&quot;</p><p class="double">The white unicorn&#039;s eyes widened with understanding. &quot;Oh dear. I know all too well what your sister is going through. Come along dear, let&#039;s go back to my house, and try and get her sobered up a little.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Some time later, with Nyx having taken the lead with Fluttershy, they found their way to the library door, and the expected party behind it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, I&#039;m Key Lime Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?&quot; Color aside, Pinkie seemed just like she always was. &quot;I saw you when you first got here, remember? I was all <i>gasp</i>, and you were all &#039;right, green&#039; remember?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stop.&quot; At Twilight&#039;s command, the energetic mare froze mid bounce. &quot;Key Lime Pie? Any relation to the Orange Family?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yupperoony! Did you already meet my cousins?&quot; Key Lime resumed bouncing as she spoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I ended up sampling the catering.&quot; Twilight replied with a flat look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh!&quot; Key Lime snapped her hoof. Somehow. &quot;Don&#039;t worry about that! This party is foal-friendly! No booze, unless you want to ask Whiskey for something. She likes mixing drinks, it&#039;s her special talent!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That explains why there&#039;s an open bar as part of the catering.&quot; Twilight sighed, as a pegasus flew up behind Key Lime.</p><p class="double">&quot;So that&#039;s why you threw up on me earlier? Whiskey got you good and drunk before sending you my way? Totally not cool, by the way.&quot; Rainbow Dash crossed her forehooves, trying to glower at both Twilight and the farm mare at the same time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For once, Celestia&#039;s entrance had gone off without a hitch. The sun had even been up for a whole two hours before things went pear shaped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twilight?&quot; Turning to the familiar voice, Twilight was faced with Minuette and Lyra, wearing black suits and sunglasses. &quot;We&#039;re really sorry about this.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Lyra sent a stunning spell at Nyx, while Minuette clocked Twilight upside the head with an enchanted baguette. The last thing Twilight saw, as the magic bread smashed into her face, was Lyra lifting Nyx onto her back.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up upside down in a bush, with the broken remains of the aforementioned baguette impaled on her horn. Judging by the position of the sun, twenty minutes had passed. She could hear somepony addressing the crowd, from atop city hall.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Celestia has fled, in the face of Princess Luna&#039;s return! But there is no cause for alarm, as the wise Princess Cadance has taken the reborn Luna under her wing, and together they shall lead Equestria into a new age of prosperity!&quot; It was Flash Sentry, of all ponies. Pulling the bread from her face, Twilight saw that he too wore a black suit. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">78.1 continued</p><p class="double">“Um... can I have a word with Cadence? Er... alone, please,” the yellow pegasus asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight gave her a look, then nodded. “Sure.”</p><p class="double">As soon as they&#039;d left, Cadence chuckled. “Well, well, well. I never thought I&#039;d see another changeling here... without my having planned it, at least.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shrugged, her pastel-green-and-pink dress shifting slightly. “Metamorphia. I wish I could say I&#039;d never expected to see you again.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, still bitter?” Metamorphia closed the door with a quick flash of magic, and then dropped her shapeshift. “We <i>did</i> say, may the best ling win. And I did. Frankly, you&#039;re lucky I only forced you into exile...”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “But, well, far be it from <i>me</i> to ignore the workings of fate. Want to rejoin the swarm? I could ue someone as powerful as you... so long as you obey my commands without question, of course.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis smiled. “I&#039;ll decline, thank you. But I did have a question.”</p><p class="double">“Go ahead.” Metamorphia smirked, licking one fang. “I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be worth it.”</p><p class="double">“Why are you doing this?”</p><p class="double">The Changeling Queen blinked. “...have you become soft in the carapace? We&#039;re Changelings – it&#039;s what we do. We need love to live, and we get it by taking the place of loved ones. This &#039;Shining Armor&#039; loves <i>so</i> strongly, he could feed the whole hive.” Metamorphia clacked a hoof on the floor. “I have to take the easiest way out, you know. It&#039;s better for all involved – really. He gets to exist in a state of mindless, loving bliss, we get our food and the hive can survive and grow.”</p><p class="double">“And the other ponies in Canterlot? In Equestria?”</p><p class="double">“You <i>have</i> gone soft.” Metamorphia snorted. “The needs of the hive come first. The needs of these ponies – come nowhere at all.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re really not very good at this whole <i>ruling</i> thing, are you?” Chrysalis challenged.</p><p class="double">Metamorphia blinked. “What?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis ran back over all the second thoughts, all the horrible realizations, all the times she&#039;d beaten herself up for what her baseline self had done.</p><p class="double">“Well, first of all, you didn&#039;t even <i>consider</i> diplomacy. Equestria is no dark empire, exterminating changelings wherever they can be found – the ruler of the moon, Luna, attempted a coup against her sister, Celestia. Yet they rule together today.”</p><p class="double">“Weakness,” Metamorphia shrugged off. “Only one queen can exist in a hive. Anything else is contradiction.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis continued with something that hadn&#039;t occurred to her the first time, but which sank the plan all alone. “Your plan, as cruel as it is, would work... for a few decades, at most. Then Shining Armor would grow old, or die, and then... then you have nothing. No ponies left to drain, other races on their guard, and ultimately changelings die out.”</p><p class="double">Metamorphia began to speak, but Chrysalis held up a hoof. “Except that your plan wouldn&#039;t work at all. The elder ruler of the ponies of Equestria is Princess Celestia. She is no mere figurehead – she raises and lowers the sun! Her sister commands the moon.” Chrysalis gestured out the window, at the blazing light of near-noon. “Without them, whether you gain Shining Armor or not, the sun would freeze in the sky. Half our world would burn, the other half would freeze.”</p><p class="double">The Queen frowned, clearly thinking hard.</p><p class="double">“And thirdly... you didn&#039;t do all your research. Have you heard of the Elements of Harmony?”</p><p class="double">“That weapon the ponies use against their enemies?” Metamorphia dismissed it. “I have taken steps to neutralize it. The guards covering the door to the treasury are all disguised changelings.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. “That would be helpful, except for two factors. Firstly, the Elements are a weapon – but each individual one is a mark of great virtue. Friendship, Loyalty, Generosity, Laughter, Honesty... and Kindness. That alone should tell you that they would at least <i>listen</i> to you.”</p><p class="double">“Words, and words alone,” Metamorphia said, but Chrysalis could taste a slight confusion in her mental state. A sense of uncertainty, of details unknown.</p><p class="double">“And, finally... you didn&#039;t know <i>who</i> the bearers are.” Chrysalis finally dropped her shapeshift, and with a flash of green light her Kindness necklace appeared from her subspace pocket.</p><p class="double">Metamorphia&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">“I rarely even go in disguise any more around town,” Chrysalis added. “I only shifted today because the dress fits better with my pegasus form.”</p><p class="double">She released the lock on her emotional bleed, and let it drift into the air. Letting the changeling who could so easily be her younger self taste her sincerity. “We can still solve this without fighting, Meta. Please.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Cadence lay on the floor of her prison, lightly napping to conserve her strength.</p><p class="double">Celestia had taught her how alicorns could go &#039;dormant&#039; to while away long stretches of time with no food, water or air, but it wasn&#039;t working as well as it could. And she still held out hope that somepony would realize her place had been taken.</p><p class="double">So, napping it was.</p><p class="double">Then, a tapping sound broke into her slumber.</p><p class="double">She opened her eyes, and struggled to her hooves as the tapping came closer. It was the staccato <i>clop</i> of two sets of hooves... or possibly one set, taking small quick steps.</p><p class="double">The sound paused for a moment, then resumed at half the speed.</p><p class="double">“Princess Mi Amore Cadenza?” a soft voice asked, from around a corner.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s me,” she replied, relief warring with caution in her heart. “Who&#039;s there?”</p><p class="double">A butter-yellow pegasus stepped around the corner.</p><p class="double">“Who... oh, I saw a picture of you,” she said, frowning. “One of Twilight&#039;s friends, yes?”</p><p class="double">“I have that honour.” The pegasus paused. “This might be a little shocking, but please don&#039;t panic. I promise, it&#039;ll all be fine soon.”</p><p class="double">Then her form rippled and changed in a flush of green fire.</p><p class="double">Cadence gasped. “Changeling!”</p><p class="double">“I am, yes,” the revealed shapeshifter confirmed. “But I had no part of imprisoning you, nor do I wish you to stay entombed.” She reached up, slowly, and tapped the Element dangling from her neck. It gave a faint flash of warm green light.</p><p class="double">“My name – my <i>real</i> name – is Chrysalis. For the last several years, I&#039;ve been pretending to be a pegasus by the name of Fluttershy. She doesn&#039;t really exist – it&#039;s just a name and form I made up.”</p><p class="double">She paused, and Cadence spoke into the silence. “I... don&#039;t understand. Why would you do that?”</p><p class="double">“When I did... ponies didn&#039;t like changelings. They still don&#039;t like them, much, but in Ponyville, and in Apploosa, things are different.” Chrysalis closed her eyes for a long moment. “I&#039;m glad they are. Anyway, I was invited to your wedding, and I quickly noticed that your place had been taken by another changeling. My elder sister-”</p><p class="double">“Queen Metamorphia,” Cadence finished. “She taunted me, told me who Shining was really going to marry.” The young alicorn&#039;s voice wavered. “It... hurt.”</p><p class="double">“I know,” Chrysalis said, softly. “The feeling, of knowing that somepony you love won&#039;t be with you, and you won&#039;t be with them, and they don&#039;t even know. It&#039;s... horrible.”</p><p class="double">Then she shook her head, and wiped away a tear. “I had a talk with my sister, and... well.”</p><p class="double">Another voice spoke up. “I... I don&#039;t really understand all this yet, but I <i>am</i> sorry, Cadence. I&#039;ll get you out of here, and then my sister will plead my case to Celestia. Hopefully, if we&#039;re to be run out of Equestria, we can at least get a head start.”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;ll understand,” Chrysalis assured her. “Now, Cadence. You&#039;ve got a wedding to go to.”</p><p class="double"><hr></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>79.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u><b>Pranking a princess</b></u></p><p class="double">“…And now, it is my great honour to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria... Princess Celestia!”</p><p class="double">The Solar Princess stepped out onto the platform overlooking Ponyville Town Hall and all her little ponies. It took all her centuries of experience and practice to remain suitably regal when inside she was waiting for the other horseshoe to drop. Why hadn’t Nightmare Moon already attacked? She was a creature of rage and vengeance, not cool calculation.</p><p class="double">She should have come after Celestia as soon as she broke free of the moon, and Celestia had seen the her sister&#039;s shadow disappear with her own eyes as the conjunction reached it&#039;s climax. The idea that she might have learned to plan filled the princess with a cold that even her sun couldn’t banish. If she attacked now, all the ponies of Ponyville would be at risk from the side-effects of two alicorns fighting. The only thing to do to protect her subjects would be to let Nightmare Moon defeat her as quickly as possible. Until then, she had a duty, which would normally be a pleasure.</p><p class="double">“My dear little ponies, once again we stand at the dawn of a new day…”</p><p class="double">She hadn’t actually bothered to write a speech this year, as she hadn’t expected to have a chance to deliver it. However, she had a thousand year back catalogue to draw from, and a thousand years of experience at public speaking. She kept it short, she kept it simple, she filled it with what would have been platitudes if they hadn’t been so genuinely meant. The only concession she made to what was to come was a brief sentence on the end.</p><p class="double">“There will be times ahead which will call on all of us to be our best, but I know that all of you are more than equal to any challenges the future may bring. Though it was first brought forth in the deepest winter, the fire of friendship still lives in all of our hearts of all of us even now. Let it shine as the sun shines.”</p><p class="double">It was time. She drew on her power and rose into the air, wings outstretched. In this moment when all her power was focussed on the sun, she’d be vulnerable. If Nightmare Moon was to strike, it would be now. She readied herself, but didn’t deviate from her task. The sun rose, silhouetting her against the window behind the balcony, and ponies oohed and aahed as birds around her sang a triumphal fanfare.</p><p class="double">She landed and smiled benevolently at her cheering subjects, expertly hiding the strain on her eyes behind a mask of cheerfulness. As she looked out over the crowd, she could see Twilight and Spike cheering as loudly as any-pony else. She hadn’t expected to be able to talk to her student again, at least until after Nightmare Moon was defeated. She made a sudden decision and jumped off the balcony, gliding down.</p><p class="double">“Princess Celestia!” Twilight came forward joyfully to meet her. The purple unicorn had a rather fetching costume on, complete with a tasteful star shaped ear rings and a matching choker. Considering Twilight normally only wore saddlebags, and then only to carry books around, it was a pleasant surprise.</p><p class="double">Celestia gave her first genuine smile. “My faithful student, I’m glad to see you here.”</p><p class="double">“Well of course, I had to make sure the Celebration was up to your standards. Was it?”</p><p class="double">Her eagerness made Celestia want to chuckle. “Yes, a task most excellently done. And your studies of the old legends of the Mare in the Moon?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Don’t worry Princess, I put them aside just as you instructed. I understand now what you intended for me to learn. I&#039;ve read similar stories often enough, a pony gets so wrapped up in some goal, wealth or power or knowledge that she forgets that there are other important things in the world, like friendship and happiness. There were things I learned in Ponyville that I couldn’t have learned in a thousand libraries. It’s been amazing!</p><p class="double">“I’m just sorry I panicked about some silly legend in some ancient book. If your sister really was going to come back as Nightmare Moon to bring eternal night, you’d have prepared Equestria to defend against her. You wouldn’t have needed my warning, or my efforts. I guess that’s why you assigned me that reading material, to remind me to check my sources and never belief something without corroboration, just because it’s in a book.</p><p class="double">“Oh, what am I thinking, I want to introduce you to my new friends. You did say I should try and make some…”</p><p class="double">Celestia had maintained her composure with difficulty. Twilight hadn’t carried on studying? She’d never expected the workaholic unicorn to take her at her word! But then Twilight was also obsessive about following instructions, and ones from Celestia would be treated as holy writ. This was bad, when Nightmare Moon attacked, Twilight needed to have enough information to find the Elements of Harmony…</p><p class="double">She calmed herself. No, it was fine, there were copies of the right reference books in the local library and the first thing she’d do after Nightmare Moon was proven to be real would be to hit the books and find out what she needed to know. And she had made friends, the critical component for activating the Elements.</p><p class="double">While Celestia was adjusting her plans, Twilight brought forth her first friend, an orange earth-pony with a blonde mane and a Appleoosa-style hat. She was balancing a plate with a piece of cake and a fork on her saddle, and it stayed rock steady even when she bowed her head to the princess and doffed her hat.</p><p class="double">“Princess Celestia, I’d like you to meet Applejack. She runs Sweet Apple Acres, they did all the catering.”</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled warmly. “Ah yes, I remember giving the Apple family the land grant. I understand it prospers?”</p><p class="double">“We get by, your princess-ship. It’s an honour to meet you. I figured raising the sun and all would most likely make you powerful hungry, so I brought over a slice of our finest apple cake, made by yours truly. Them chefs in Canterlot probably don’t feed you right, all small helpings with lots of fancy avec all over them, so I thought you might like to try some plain, down-home cooking for a change.”</p><p class="double">Celestia lifted the plate off the earth-pony and sampled the cake. It really was excellent, moist and flavoursome with the apple pieces perfectly complementing the farmhouse sponge. “Mmmm, this is wonderful. You’re a credit to your family.”</p><p class="double">“Why thank you kindly. I hope you’ll consider Sweet Apple Acres for any of your apple related needs in future.”</p><p class="double">That gave Celestia pause, at least mentally, though she kept eating the cake, because… cake! No it was probably just natural pride in her skills talking, and not a shameless plug for her farm. She was about to ask the farm-pony more about her meeting with Twilight, but the purple unicorn had already brought forth her next friend, a white unicorn with elaborately styled hair and a dress more suitable for the Grand Galloping Gala. She’d been up on the balcony as some sort of stage manager, Celestia remembered.</p><p class="double">“And this is Rarity. She did all the decorating, and she’s an amazing designer and dressmaker. She’s also very generous, she even gave me this dress and matching jewellery so I’d have something appropriate to wear for the occasion.”</p><p class="double">That made Celestia examine the white unicorn more closely. The Element of Generosity maybe?</p><p class="double">Rarity bowed her head, but was almost immediately up and talking. “Oh my goodness, your Highness, this really is an honour and a privilege! I never imagined when Twilight told me she was your personal student that I might have a chance to meet you face to face! I so admire Canterlot, the glamour and the fashions, I even try to emulate it in my own small way, such as the ensembles I threw together for Twilight and myself. They aren’t ‘too much’ I hope?”</p><p class="double">Celestia quashed the unworthy suspicion that both Rarity and Applejack had been less than honest with her student. They were both just enthused by their passions, and surely hadn’t just be-friended Twilight to get a shot at sweet-talking Celestia. “No, both the outfits are lovely. I’m glad Twilight found such a firm friend so quickly.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, Twilight knows she can call on me for anything she needs. She already offered to help me make some contacts in Canterlot, or rather her darling little dragon has. For that matter your highness, if you ever felt the need for something other than your normal regalia,it would be an honour to provide something suitably regal.”</p><p class="double">At least the unicorn in front of her didn&#039;t lack brass. “Thank you, but not at the moment. My regalia is durable, whereas most normal clothing falls to pieces after only a couple of centuries. But I will keep your kind offer in mind.”</p><p class="double">The next pony Twilight brought up in front of her was a blue pegasus with a rainbow coloured mane.</p><p class="double">“And my next friend is Rainbow Dash! She&#039;s the lead weather-pony and cleared the sky for today in ten seconds flat, I know because I timed it! She&#039;s an amazing flyer, and could well be Wonderbolt material. She works really hard every day training to improve her flying, just the way I do my magic, so we even had something in common. Getting into the Wonderbolts for her would be like when you took me on as your student. She really is astounding!”</p><p class="double">The pegasus grinned. “Yep, it&#039;s all true. Twinkle here knows talent when she sees it.”</p><p class="double">“You mean Twilight Sparkle, don&#039;t you?” Celestia asked. She had grave suspicions as to exactly who&#039;d convinced Twilight to give such a glowing recommendation.</p><p class="double">“Uh yeah, that&#039;s what I said.” The pegasus said with a shifty look. “We got talking when we met, and she thought maybe having you put in a good word with the Wonderbolts for me couldn&#039;t hurt.”</p><p class="double">This was a lot more blatant than the other two, however Twilight looked so eager, Celestia didn&#039;t have the heart to call the pegasus out. “I see. Well, I&#039;m glad to see Twilight taking such an interest in her friends&#039; well being.”</p><p class="double">Twilight was already bringing up her next &#039;friend&#039;, or rather levitating her, despite the fact that she was a pegasus, and could fly well enough on her own. “And this is Fluttershy, who orchestrated the bird-song chorus for your arrival. She cares for all the animals in Ponyville.”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked down at the cowering yellow pony, who would clearly be quite beautiful if she didn&#039;t look so scared. At least this one wasn&#039;t trying to get something out of her. She knelt and tried to look as non-threatening as possible.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m very pleased to meet you Fluttershy. Thank you for the music, your bird-song choir was lovely.”</p><p class="double">“y&#039;wlcm.” The words were stumbling and barely audible, and Celestia could only just make them out.</p><p class="double">“Are you alright? I assure you, I may look intimidating, but I&#039;m quite friendly when you get to know me.” She&#039;d intended it as a light jest, something to break the ice, but if anything, the attention seemed to make the pegasus shrink back even further with a whimper.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry Princess, she was a lot more articulate when I talked to her yesterday afternoon. As soon as she saw Spike she almost flattened me getting to him, and she couldn&#039;t stop asking him questions.”</p><p class="double">It took a lot to make Celestia feel awkward, but the pony in front of her acting as if she was the headless horse was getting her there. “I&#039;m sure its just stress from the long night. Fluttershy, you may go rest if you wish.”</p><p class="double">The yellow pony vanished from in front of her, and she thought she saw the edge of a pink mane peeking over the edge of a table on the far side of the room but she couldn&#039;t be sure.</p><p class="double">“And finally there&#039;s...” Twilight&#039;s introduction was cut off as a pink pony appeared out of nowhere.</p><p class="double">“... Pinkie Pie! Oh my gosh we have to have a party for you as you&#039;re new to Ponyville and I throw every-pony who&#039;s new to Ponyville a party, like Twilight when I met her in the street and went...”</p><p class="double">She jumped up in the air and froze in a splayed out position, mouth opened in a shocked gasp.</p><p class="double">“... because I know every-pony in Ponyville but I didn&#039;t know her so I dashed off to set up a party with cakes and balloons and party games and hot sauce and every-pony because I thought that if she was new to Ponyville then she wouldn&#039;t know any-pony here and if she didn&#039;t know any-pony here she&#039;d have no friends and be sad and that makes me sad so I went and set up the party so she&#039;d meet lots of ponies and make lots of friends and smile and that would make me smile.”</p><p class="double">The Princess wasn&#039;t sure where the earth-pony had gotten the air to breathe, let alone say all that at once. She&#039;d visibly deflated at the end, and the massive gulp of air she took had somehow managed to rustle even the princess&#039;s ethereal mane. At least this one seemed genuine if more than slightly indiscriminate, not to mention crazy. Then Pinkie put her hoof to her chin in a &#039;thinker&#039; pose.</p><p class="double">“But I suppose this whole Summer Sun Celebration is really your party, but we could always have a party inside the party... Wowie! That would make it partyception! I have to go find more streamers...”</p><p class="double">As she vanished, Celestia turned to Twilight to see her pull a piece of paper from inside her dress and tick something off, muttering, “Show my new friends to the princess... done!”</p><p class="double">“Twilight... Is that a check-list?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, yes it is. I wanted to make sure I&#039;d done the job properly. Thankfully this whole making friends thing was a lot easier than I thought it would be, I expected to have to hole up in the library and do some serious research on the best techniques on friend making, but it turned out I didn&#039;t need to. As soon as I told ponies who I was and why I was there, they were jumping at the chance to be my friend. I must have a hidden talent for this sort of thing... right girls?”</p><p class="double">The last was directed towards the first three friends who&#039;d grouped up at the buffet. Two of them replied right away, with false sincerity. “Uh huh, sure as shooting sugarcube!” “Oh, absolutely darling!” but Rainbow Dash required a nudge from Rarity before she called out, with obviously faked enthusiasm, “Yeah, whatever you say Twinkle... whooo!”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked back and forth between them and her student. Surely even Twilight couldn&#039;t be this clueless? But all she saw on Twilight&#039;s face was a broad smile. “You see? I have such great friends.”</p><p class="double">Apparently she could. It suddenly occurred to Celestia that it might have been worthwhile to actually convince Twilight to take part in more social events around Canterlot, practice her social skills and making friends rather than simply dropping her straight into it when the fate of Equestria relied on her getting it right. Thank her sun that Nightmare Moon hadn&#039;t actually made an appearance.</p><p class="double">“Ha ha ha ha! Free at last! Free to bring my glorious night over all Equestria!”</p><p class="double">Celestia spun to face the balcony, where Nightmare Moon had appeared in all her glory. This was bad, this was very bad. With a lack of information and no true understanding of friendship, Twilight wouldn&#039;t be ready to get the Elements. Celestia drew on her power, her mane and tail starting to glow like solar prominences. Hopefully she could grab the Nightmare and teleport them both far above the sky where she could fight without restrictions. With her sun already in the sky, she might just have a chance against the conjunction empowered alicorn.</p><p class="double">“Now stop this at once!” Celestia was aghast, Twilight had teleported right in front of Nightmare Moon and had materialised a soap box so she could see eye to eye with her. Celestia couldn&#039;t do anything without breaking her power up sequence and losing any chance to defeat her sister. Well she could speak at least.</p><p class="double">She called out. “Twilight! Run!”</p><p class="double">Astoundingly the unicorn glanced at her with a confident smile. “Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve got this!”</p><p class="double">“Little foal! Do you know who I am?” The Nightmare raged, her midnight mane hauling the unicorn&#039;s face back to face her. “Do you not know the prophecy? Did you not see the signs?”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s purple magic amazingly pushed the mane away, and she rolled her eyes. “Yes of course, you&#039;re the mare in the moon, Nightmare Moon. You&#039;ll return on the longest day of the thousandth year, starts aid your escape, yadda yadda. Take over Equestria, bring eternal night, unlimited rice pudding, etcetera, etcetera.”</p><p class="double">She sighed, “The problem is, you don&#039;t actually exist. If the prophecy were true, Princess Celestia would have done something to prepare for your return, like gather the Elements of Harmony she used to banish you once before, but they&#039;re probably just part of the story. She specifically told me the legends were nonsense, well she actually told me to stop reading those stuffy old books and get out more but the implication was clear.”</p><p class="double">“How, HOW DARE YOU!” Nightmare Moon raged, using the full Canterlot Royal Voice. “Can you not see me with your own eyes?”</p><p class="double">“That proves nothing.” Twilight replied, “These are hardly controlled conditions. You are most probably a hallucination, triggered by overwork, tiredness from the all night party and the legends I was reading up on, and using my magical power to manifest as a physical illusion. Or possibly I ate too much of Applejack&#039;s amazing cake and you&#039;re due to some quirk of digestion. There&#039;s more of apple than of apocalypse about you!”</p><p class="double">Celestia was almost ready to act, but that last comment seemed to hit Nightmare Moon just as hard. She stepped back a pace and her mane and tail seemed to droop. “Really?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head again. “Look, I&#039;m sorry. I know this was probably really important to you, but the Mare in the Moon is just an old pony tale, at least the prophecy part. Seriously, it sounds like the set up to a bad Daring Doo fan fic. Some-pony would probably have to go on an epic quest to find the lost Elements of Harmony with a band of stalwart companions who despite being randomly picked would turn out to be exactly who she needed to make them work. I mean, really....”</p><p class="double">She looked at the other mare, who looked away and said in a subdued voice. “Well, this is embarrassing. Uh... I should probably go, shouldn&#039;t I?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s probably for the best.” Twilight nodded. She brightened up. “Hey, I know, why don&#039;t you come back on Nightmare Night? Well technically since you&#039;re a figment of my imagination you will if I decide you should, but that&#039;s not a problem. A real imaginary Nightmare Moon running around would really liven things up.”</p><p class="double">“I might just do that.” Nightmare Moon stated with a decisive nod. “Ahem. You can go about your business, my sun loving subjects. But mark my words, I will be back... Mwahahahaha!”</p><p class="double">She vanished in a puff of logic, and Celestia tried to recover from total brain crash. “But... what... Nightmare... Luna... What?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">79.2 (Conceptualist)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my beloved subjects. It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve seen your precious, little sun-loving faces.&quot;</p><p class="double">As typical for loops where Princess Luna and/or Nyx were UnAwake, Nightmare Moon had returned from the moon to shroud the land in Eternal Night. How unfortunate for her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember this day, little ponies, for it was your last. From this moment forth, the night will last for-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Gima bak Mha Litle Nomes!&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence fell over the room. No pony dare speak for fear of snickering or giggling, and possibly offending one of the two legends that were about to clash.</p><p class="double">&quot;What,&quot; Nightmare deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gima bak!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What gnomes. I don&#039;t have any gnomes. I just flew back from the moon, and have only-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! So dats whare da danambit cult put em. Tak me to mha Nomes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No way am I going back to my moon now. I just got back and still need to make my night etr-&quot; *whak* &quot;Ow!&quot;</p><p class="double">In the silence, the first whak echoed loudly. Nightmare Moon stood still, in shock that somepony would dare whak her with a rolled up newspaper. Nopony dared to move lest they draw the Pony Princess&#039;s ire, until - *whak-whak* - the whakking continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am you&#039;re-&quot;*whak*&quot;- rightfull prin-&quot;*wham*&quot;-cess and I -&quot;*Wham*&quot;-demand that-&quot;*KABONG*&quot;...Ouch...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, to da moon! I needs Mha Litle Nomes! They be missen dear sweet Old Mare Henderson.&quot;</p><p class="double">And so, the Nightmare returned to the moon and the day was saved. Nightmare Moon got the evil beaten out of her when Old Mare Henderson found out there actually weren&#039;t any gnomes on the moon. </p><p class="double">Princess Luna took Henderson back down to Equestria, and never set hoof in Ponyville again.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">79.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;...and that&#039;s how I earned the Element of Kindness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie whistled, waving Macintosh over to refill her drink. &quot;Huh, neat. Simon the digger had that element when I got magic once, but it was more battle mercy than anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rolled her eyes. &quot;Yes, yes, fistfight with the moon, you&#039;ve shown me the pictures.&quot; She tapped her necklace thoughtfully. &quot;So, with Gilda&#039;s honesty and Spike&#039;s loyalty, that makes, what, four out of six?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch slapped another necklace between them. &quot;Laughter. Five out of six.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them stared at the grape-shaped crystal for a few moments.</p><p class="double">&quot;...okay, what?&quot; Trixie finally sputtered.</p><p class="double">&quot;How in fagales...?&quot; Chrysalis added.</p><p class="double">The bartender sighed. &quot;I don&#039;t like bringing it up, cause.... well, the loop was a variant where Nightmare Moon killed Celestia before she could be banished, and since Nightmare Moon was Luna she kind of went insane with guilt and rage.&quot; She shuddered. &quot;And the dominos fell, and... it was a dark loop, literally and metaphorically.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">79.4 (TokoWH)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was still rather early on in the loop for Spyro, and for now he decided to mostly keep things rather baseline. He had a rather funny plan later on for how he would beat Ripto this loop, involving a bucket of shaving cream, and complex system of ropes and pulleys, and a catapult, but until then he had nothing better to do at the moment other than rescue the dragons. He checked his atlas, making sure he had gotten everything he usually did by that point. Smirking, he went over to the near by pool and started jumping on the stones.</p><p class="double">All he had left to do now was the speedway. Typically in the loops, he&#039;d handle the speedways last. Not that he didn&#039;t like them or anything, quite the contrary. Though it was rather easy for him to get quick times on them now, he still liked the glorified obstacle courses and how he could blaze through them. It&#039;s just that he had gotten into that habit when it came to handling things baseline.</p><p class="double">The secret &#039;passage&#039; opening to reveal the hidden portal, Spyro was quick to jump in. A quick trek through the portal mini-dimension and Spyro found himself once again at the start of the first of many speedways on his journey. Spyro was quick to check the score board... and promptly did a double take shortly after.</p><p class="double"><u>Sunny Flight Speedway record - 0:10.00 - RD</u></p><p class="double">Spyro narrowed his eyes. Somehow, he felt like he and Sparx weren&#039;t the only loopers this loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Night Flight Speedway record - 0:10.00 - RD</u></p><p class="double"><i>Twitch</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Crystal Flight Speedway record - 0:10.00 - RD</u></p><p class="double"><i>Twitch</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Wild Flight Flight Speedway record - 0:10.00 - RD</u></p><p class="double"><i>Twitch twitch</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Icy Flight Flight Speedway record - 0:10.00 - RD</u></p><p class="double"><i>Twitch twitch twitch</i></p><p class="double">Sparx looked at the record, and promptly scratched his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can understand her wanting to get the records for the speedways after we met her in that fused loop, but what up with the whole &#039;ten seconds flat&#039; thing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sparx glanced over to Spyro, rolling his eyes. Spyro was sitting on the hill with a blank expression on his face, his eye occasionally twitching as his gaze was glued to the scoreboard. Sparx sighed. He got the feeling with all the crazy stuff other loopers from different loops could pull off, this was going to happen eventually. Compared to that <i>other </i>Spyro they met a few loops back, his Spyro prided himself on his abilities and had a rather big ego to go along with it.</p><p class="double">So if there was one thing he could <i>not </i>stand, it was someone being better at something than him.</p><p class="double">&quot;You going to be alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spyro stood frozen for a few seconds, before he finally scowled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sparx, I think I know what we&#039;re going to be doing for the next few loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Spyro turned around and started to walk off, Sparx face palmed and let out a long sigh.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">On top of a nearby hill, Rainbow Dash chuckled to herself. True, she could have gotten a much lower time than ten seconds for all these speedways, but she didn&#039;t want to <i>completely </i>discourage Spyro. Considering from the time he spent in his first fused loop in Equestria, she could gather the dragon thought of himself rather highly. As such, it was going to be rather fun knocking him down a few pegs.</p><p class="double">Now she only wondered how long she could keep this up before he rage quits and tries to end the loop like that time he tried to fight the non-awake Discord. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">79.5 (Midnight Crescent)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Twilight the Underdog - Chapter 3</u></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up to the sound of her phone ringing. She quickly answered, and sat up in her bed.</p><p class="double">“Hello?”</p><p class="double">“Hi Josie, it’s Yugi. Grandpa found a package for me this morning, and you’ll never guess who it’s from!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, it’s that time already?” Twilight asked, as her mind finally caught up with her. She lowered her voice for her next question. “And, let me guess, your grandpa is still in the room, right?”</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah, it is to do with Duellist Kingdom... But that was just a lucky guess!”</p><p class="double">“Alright, when do you want me to come round for?”</p><p class="double">“Can you get here for 10?”</p><p class="double">“If you brew a pot of coffee, I can be there by 9:30.”</p><p class="double">“Sure! I’ll see you then.”</p><p class="double">Twilight climbed out of her bed, wandered over to her wardrobe, and started to get ready.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Twilight walked through the door of the game store, the first thing she saw was a pot of coffee on the counter, and Yami stood beside it, hands firmly wedged in his pockets as always.</p><p class="double">“I hope this is to your liking, Twilight.” Yami said. “Yugi and I have never tried to make coffee before.”</p><p class="double">Twilight eyed the black liquid suspiciously, before adding a dash of milk. Taking a sip, she sighed in relief.</p><p class="double">“For a first attempt, that was fine.” Twilight said as she began to cradle the cup. “So, what happens now?”</p><p class="double">“Well, we have to wait and see how Pegasus acts, but...”</p><p class="double">“Why do I have the feeling that but is going to be a major pain?” Twilight asked, taking a seat on the counter.</p><p class="double">“Alright, so far, there have been a few different versions of Pegasus. Sometimes, he focuses purely on his Kaiba Corporation takeover, either for their holographic technology or for the money. Sometimes he and Yami Bakura essentially switch places. I have seen loops where he does the tournament in his late wife’s memory, and others where he cancels the tournament last minute because of Kaiba’s mysterious disappearance.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed “So what you’re saying is that we have no idea what could happen? I’d ask why that doesn’t surprise me, but I have a feeling the answer wouldn’t either.”</p><p class="double">“Well, most of the time, he does end up as his baseline - an eccentric billionaire inviting many children and young adults to his private island to play a children&#039;s card game.”</p><p class="double">“Sure... Wait, what?” Twilight said, doing a double take. “So, remind me not to be in a room alone with Pegasus then...”</p><p class="double">Yami continued to smirk “Duly noted. Now, no matter what version of Pegasus we end up with, the invitation remains practically the same. Unless he cancels the tournament, he will send a VHS inviting me to take part in the tournament. Sometimes there may be a shadow game, sometimes not.”</p><p class="double">“Well, if that’s the case, how are you going to get me out there? It’s not as though you can ask a tape...”</p><p class="double">“That will depend on if there is a shadow game or not.”</p><p class="double">“What does that have to do with anything?”</p><p class="double">“If there is a shadow game, then I will be duelling with Pegasus. That means I can talk to Pegasus, and at least try to get you included in Duellist Kingdom. No shadow game, then no conversation, and we can only try the baseline.”</p><p class="double">“So we hope there’s a shadow game?”</p><p class="double">“Unfortunately, yes.”</p><p class="double">Twilight poured herself another cup as she contemplated things. “So be it. How much longer do we have to wait before everyone else gets here?”</p><p class="double">“Tea should be here any minute now. And Tristan said he had other things to attend to. I assume it will have to do with... Nyx, was it?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Yeah. I’m just glad there’ll be someone with her. Maybe we should get ready while we wait for Tea?”</p><p class="double">“Solomon is setting everything up. Although, he did start before I even called you. Perhaps we should check on him...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once Tea had shown up, the group sat down in the back room, and began the tape. A man appeared on the TV, in a scarlet suit, sipping a glass of wine.</p><p class="double">“<i>It’s started sir.” </i>A voice flowed through the TVs speakers, evidently from someone behind the camera. The figure sat in the chair on camera nodded before speaking.</p><p class="double">“<i>Greetings, Yugi-boy. I am Maximillian Pegasus, creator of Duel Monsters.”</i></p><p class="double">“We al...”</p><p class="double">“<i>But I’m certain you knew that already.” </i>Pegasus took a sip of wine. “<i>Your recent defeat of Seto Kaiba has thrown the duelling world into quite the furor... and I must say I approve. Seto always was a little up tight. I think you’ll be a breath of fresh air, Yugi-boy.”</i></p><p class="double">“What is he rambling on about this time?” Solomon asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“This time?” Yami asked.</p><p class="double">“Shh, he’s started talking again.”</p><p class="double"><i>He’s very clearly avoiding the question, Yami. </i>Yugi pointed out.</p><p class="double"><i>I noticed. What I want to know is why...</i> Yami replied.</p><p class="double">“<i>Ahh, I seem to be getting ahead of myself. I’m certain you’ve heard of my little tournament I’ve arranged. Well, to be blunt, ever since your duel, no-one’s seen or heard from Kaiba-boy. Which is a problem. I need someone to be the big draw at my tournament. And, if I can’t have Kaiba-boy, then who better than the rising star who beat him?”</i></p><p class="double">“But that was my first real duel. How can he be so sure I’ll be good enough?” Yami</p><p class="double">“It was broadcast across the country, Yugi.” Solomon said, placing his hand on his Grandson’s shoulder “You deserved to win, no doubt about it.”</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Everything you’ll need is in the box this tape came in. Goodbye, Yugi-boy.”</i></p><p class="double">“Tea, what’s in there?”</p><p class="double">“Give me a sec...” She pulled out a tray, containing a glove, two small tokens shaped like stars, and two Duel Monsters cards. She placed the tray on the table. “Hey, wait. There’s something still in there.” Digging more padding out of the box, tea produced another tray, its contents the same as the first.</p><p class="double">“Wait, why were there two?” Yami asked, a puzzled look on his face. <i>Seriously, do you have any ideas, Yugi?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Sorry Yami. I’m drawing a blank too... </i>Yugi replied.</p><p class="double">“I suppose it’s now or never...” Solomon said. “Pegasus wanted Duellist Kingdom to be the largest tournament ever. So he’s invited every Regional Champion, reigning or former.”</p><p class="double">It took a moment or two for Yami and Yugi to catch on to what that meant. The pair switched places before Yugi continued the conversation. “But it’s been years since you really duelled, Grandpa. Are you sure you’re up to this?”</p><p class="double">“No, Yugi. I’m probably not. You’re right, I haven’t duelled in years, I haven’t even seen half of the new champions, and my deck is probably completely out of date. But I’m still going. I didn’t want to retire when I did, but I had no choice. I have another chance, and I want to take it.”</p><p class="double">“Why not just send someone in your place, say they’re your student or something. I’m sure Pegasus would understand...”</p><p class="double">“And who would I send, Yugi? You’re already going, and Tea, while she may be improving, wouldn’t last two turns against the professionals.”</p><p class="double">“Actually, I was thinking of Josie...”</p><p class="double">“Josie? She doesn’t even have any Magic or Trap Cards in her deck. I’d be better off sending Tristan, and he doesn’t even duel!”</p><p class="double">“Actually, Mr Muto, I’ve been building a new deck, with Yugi’s help. Maybe if you taught me...”</p><p class="double">“There’s less than a week until the tournament, there is nothing like enough time to teach you.”</p><p class="double">“Give her a chance, Grandpa? Duel her. If she still doesn’t impress you, then we’ll drop this. If she does well, will you at least consider it?”</p><p class="double">Solomon stood deep in thought for a few minutes. Eventually, he gave his answer.</p><p class="double">“Alright, one duel. But I won’t be going easy on you. We’ll be playing by Pegasus’ rules. And I’ll be judging your skill. Even if you somehow win, that may not be enough.”</p><p class="double">“I understand. Thank you, Mr Muto.”</p><p class="double">“If you’re going to duel me, call me Solomon. Unless you really doubt yourself that much.” Solomon quipped.</p><p class="double">“I just thought I’d show ya some respect, old timer.”</p><p class="double">Solomon stared across the table at Twilight, his lips slightly curled, obviously annoyed by the comment. He took a breath, before sliding his deck over to her, as she did the same.</p><p class="double">“Let’s duel!” The pair echoed as they drew their hands.</p><p class="double">“Ladies first, Josie. You’ll need all the help you can get.” Solomon said, as he looked over his cards.</p><p class="double">“And you’ll regret that decision. Believe me.” Twilight drew another card from her deck, and looked her hand over.<i>Well then, let’s see how he likes this... </i>Twilight smiled as set her first card on the table “I play The Secret Village of the Spellcasters. As long as I have one of my Spellcasters on the field, your magic cards are useless. Then I summon my Fool of Prophecy, and lay one card face-down.” She laid her mirror force behind her Fool. “Your move.”</p><p class="double">Solomon looked puzzled as he drew from his deck. “An interesting strategy... I’ve never seen those cards... May I?” Solomon held out his hand. Twilight slid them over. “I would assume you’re using a lot of Spellcasters, given this villages effect? And this Fool... I expect I’ll see these Spellbooks later...”</p><p class="double">“I guess there’s little use denying it.” Twilight said, returning her cards to their places “But that’s only half the problem you have, isn’t it? Even if you know what’s coming, the question now is whether or not you can stop it.”</p><p class="double">“We won’t find out by talking about it.” Solomon said, looking over the cards in his hand. He selected his Mirror Force, Swords of Revealing Light, and Horn Imp “I’ll set this monster face-down, and place two more cards face-down. That ends my turn.”</p><p class="double">Twilight drew, and looked over her hand. “I’ll set a monster face-down.” She set her Temperance of Prophecy “Now, my Fool will attack your face-down monster.”</p><p class="double">“And you were doing so well...” Solomon said, flipping one of his face-down cards. “Mirror force redirects that attack, taking down your fool. Are you done?”</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned in frustration. <i>Should have seen that coming... </i>She thought, before responding. “Yeah, your move.”</p><p class="double">“Then prepare to face one of my strongest monsters.” Solomon added a card to his hand without even looking, before drawing out a card from the centre of his hand. “I’ll bring out my Summoned Skull, in attack mode. Destroy her face-down monster.”</p><p class="double">“Oh Solomon, if it’s good enough for you...” Twilight said, flipping her Mirror Force “Say goodbye to your little skeleton.”</p><p class="double">“... I’ll admit, I should have seen that coming. Good move. But it’ll take more than that for you to win. I end my turn.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.” Twilight drew a card, and smiled as she added it to her hand. “Now, time for you to meet one of <i>my</i>powerhouses. I summon Fortune Lady Dark to the field in Attack mode.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Another </i>new card? What does this one do?” Solomon said, looking across the desk, trying to read the cards text upside down.</p><p class="double">“For now, it’s a level 5 spellcaster, with 2,000 Attack and Defence points. It has another ability, but you don’t need to worry about that right now, she can’t use it just yet.”</p><p class="double">“For now? Ahh, I see now, a level increaser. This new deck of yours is just full of surprises. What happened to the old, batter down the doors mentality?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it’s still here. I can hit you just as hard as ever. I just realised that I’d end up in a war of attrition if I did. So I came prepared. Oh, say goodbye to your face-down monster, by the way.”</p><p class="double">Solomon sighed as he moved his Horn Imp to the graveyard.</p><p class="double">She put her Spellbook of Power face-down “I’ll place a card face-down, and then it’s your move.”</p><p class="double"><i>Wait, attrition... That’s risky for her... </i>Yugi thought. <i>Grandpa’s deck is pretty much built around waiting to draw certain cards...</i></p><p class="double"><i>You mean Exodia? Twilight’s monster will just continue to get stronger. It would only take two more turns for her Fortune Lady to be stronger than everything else in that deck. With his magic cards sealed off, Exodia might be his only option...</i></p><p class="double"><i>So, Grandpa doesn’t have long to draw the cards he needs, even if he doesn’t realise it.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Considering what else is in that deck of hers, no, he does not. We should probably be paying attention to the duel, though, Yugi.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Oh, right...</i></p><p class="double">“...End my turn.” Solomon said, his Koumori Dragon now face-down on the field.</p><p class="double">Twilight prepared to draw a card. “And now that it’s my Standby Phase, my Fortune Lady goes to Level 6, and gains an extra 400 Attack and Defence points.” She then drew her card, and added it to her hand, taking out her Solemn Wishes. “I place one card face-down, and attack your face-down monster. Your move.”</p><p class="double">Solomon drew his card “Fine, I’ll just set another monster in defence mode, and end my turn.” He placed his Battle Steer face down on the table.</p><p class="double">“Then I’ll let my Fortune Lady grow to Level 7, before I get started. Now, let’s see...” Twilight looked over her hand “I think I’ll summon my Solitaire magician, and attack this monster with my Fortune Lady Dark. And, as a result of my attack, I’ll activate my Solemn Wishes Trap. It’s your move.”</p><p class="double">Solomon moved his hand to his chin, and sat in thought. “This is a lot more challenging than I thought it would be... I owe you an apology, Josie.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you. It is meant to be a major step up from my old one.”</p><p class="double">“However, I’m not going to go down without a fight. My comeback starts here. I place this monster face-down, and end my turn.” He placed his Sangan face-down as soon as he drew it.</p><p class="double">“That’s exactly what you did last turn...” Twilight said, puzzled. “No matter, my Fortune Lady Dark gains another level, taking her to over 3,000 attack and defence points, and I get an extra 500 life points in my draw phase, bringing me up to 2,500.” Twilight placed her new Swords of Revealing Light on the field face-down “Now, as a contingency, I’ll place this face-down, then get my Fortune Lady to take out your new monster again.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, I needed that...” Solomon smiled, as he moved his Sangan to the Graveyard. “Now I can add a monster to my hand, as long as their attack is 1500 or less.”</p><p class="double">“So you get a weak monster? How could that help?”</p><p class="double">“Maybe it’s weak by itself, but the Left Arm of the Forbidden One is another of the pieces I need to win this duel.”</p><p class="double">“Pieces? Maybe you could assemble something, but you just gave me exactly what I need to win. Still, it’s your move now, go ahead.”</p><p class="double">“Gladly.” Solomon looked over his hand. <i>She must be bluffing. As long as I can keep laying monsters in defence mode, she can’t touch my life points... What is she up to?</i></p><p class="double">After a minute or two, he finally decided on his move. He placed his Rude Kaiser face-down “I’ll put another monster in defence mode, and end my turn.”</p><p class="double">“Still struggling to get what you need? I know I’m not. First my cards effects activate, taking me to 3,000 life points, and taking my Fortune Lady to Level 9. Then I’ll play Monster Reborn. And I think I’ll target your Sangan.”</p><p class="double">“What use is he to you?” Solomon said, puzzled. “He’s not as strong as your Magicians, and his effect is useless to you unless he’s destroyed.”</p><p class="double">“On the contrary, this will complete my strategy. I activate my Solitaire Magician’s ability. By sacrificing three levels from my Fortune Lady Dark, I can destroy one monster on the field.”</p><p class="double">“And how does that differ from attacking my mo... wait, the field?”</p><p class="double">“And now you know. I’ll destroy the Sangan I just revived to bring Fortune Lady Light into my hand.” Twilight smiled at Solomon as she shuffled her deck. “Since I weakened my Fortune Lady, I’ll be careful and skip my attack this turn, so it’s your move.”</p><p class="double"><i>I’m out of options... Heart of the cards, please, don’t fail me now. </i>Solomon closed his eyes, and drew a card. His shoulders visibly slumped at the result. He placed his Celtic Guardian face-down “I place a monster face-down, and end my turn.”</p><p class="double">“Now where has all that enthusiasm gone?” Twilight smiled, as she pulled another card from her deck. “My life points increase to 3,500, and my Fortune Lady regains one of her lost levels. Now, I summon my Fortune Lady Light, and activate my Solitaire Magician’s effect. My Fortune Lady Dark loses another three levels, and my Fortune Lady Light goes to my graveyard.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, you went through all that effort to sacrifice it immediately?” Solomon’s face dropped, as the realisation dawned. “It has another effect, doesn’t it?”</p><p class="double">“You catch on quick. I get to Special Summon another Fortune Lady from my deck whenever Fortune Lady Light is destroyed by a Card Effect. And I choose my Fortune Lady Earth.” Twilight placed the card on the field, and began to shuffle her deck again. “Just so you know, she starts at Level 6, giving her 2400 attack and defence, and she causes 400 life point damage every time she destroys a monster. Then, when she does, my Fortune Lady Dark’s effect can activate, allowing me to resurrect my Fortune Lady Light when your monster is destroyed.”</p><p class="double">“...Allowing you to sacrifice her again, to bring out another Fortune Lady...”</p><p class="double">“Until my field is full of monsters. But I won’t even need that many. This duel will end on my next turn. But, until then, say goodbye to your new monster, 400 of your life points, dropping you to 1,600. Finally, let’s welcome back my Fortune Lady Light, in defence mode. It’s your move, Solomon.”</p><p class="double">Solomon sighed and leant back in his chair. “Congratulations, Josie, if you’re telling the truth. I draw a card and end my turn, since there really is nothing I can do. Let me see what you have in store.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, my Fortune Ladies all gain their boosts. Now, my Fortune Ladies all get stronger, and I draw my card, raising my life points to 4,000. I switch Fortune Lady Light to Attack mode, and use her to attack your face-down defence monster.”</p><p class="double">Solomon scratched his chin, trying to fathom out the previous move. “You failed to destroy my Rude Kaiser. I don’t know how you expected that to work, with such a weak monster. You lose 1,200 life points for that.”</p><p class="double">“That’s easy, it wasn’t meant to. I just needed to get one of your monsters face up, and hope it was strong enough.”</p><p class="double">“Strong enough?” Solomon asked, more confused than ever “Strong enough for what?”</p><p class="double">“Just sit back and watch, this is going to be fun. I activate Solitaire Magician’s ability, lowering my Fortune Lady Dark three more levels, in order to destroy my Fortune Lady Light. And now, I get to Special Summon my Fortune Lady Fire. Her special effect activates when she is special summoned in Attack mode, like she just was. She destroys one of your face-up monsters, and deals damage to you equal to that monsters attack power. Which, with Rude Kaiser’s 1800 attack power, should be enough to finish you off.” Twilight waited for a minute, before breaking the uncomfortable silence “So, how did I do?”</p><p class="double">“Josie, I didn’t land an attack. The only damage you took was self inflicted, and even that was intentional. I was forced to rely on a gamble to have any chance, and it didn’t pay off. If you want my honest opinion, I was struggling the moment you played that Secret Village. I’ll need to call Pegasus and make sure there’s nothing preventing this, but I honestly doubt it. Good luck in Duellist Kingdom, you deserve to be there.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After a few minutes, Solomon headed back through to the front of the shop, as Twilight began to reassemble her deck. “Well, I guess that’s one disaster averted. So, what do we do now, sit back and relax?”</p><p class="double">Yami waited until he could hear Solomon’s voice drifting through the doorway from the shop floor, before closing the separating door. “You need to be a little more careful, you were lucky he still went ahead with the duel after that old timer comment. I may not have known you long, but that doesn’t seem like you.” </p><p class="double">“I called him an old timer?” Twilight asked, a puzzled look spreading across her face.</p><p class="double">“Right before the duel started.” Yami replied, sitting across the table from her. “Do you seriously not remember?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head.</p><p class="double">“Does this sort of thing happen to you often when you loop?”</p><p class="double">Twilight continued to shake her head. “No, but Tristan said something, when we went to visit Nyx. He said a couple of the things I said reminded him of Joey.”</p><p class="double">“Well, Joey should know by now not to say that sort of thing to Solomon face to face, but he never was the brightest of the group to begin with...”</p><p class="double">“So it is something he might say?”</p><p class="double">Tea nodded in agreement. “It sounds about right, but that still doesn’t make any sense.” She turned to Yami “If Twilight is here instead of Joey, shouldn’t Joey, you know, <i>not</i> be here?”</p><p class="double">“I must admit, I cannot recall anything similar to this from any loop I have been in.”</p><p class="double">“But what about you and Yugi, could it be anything like that?”</p><p class="double">“I sincerely doubt it. Yugi and I are extremely closely linked, so much that even once we began to loop we could not be separated. You and Joey have no such bond. Tell me, does anything feel wrong in any way?”</p><p class="double">“Other than not realising what I’ve said one time? Nothing at all.”</p><p class="double">“Then I say we leave it there for now. It may get confusing for anyone else Awake that we run into, but I doubt it will be a major problem in the short term. If you start talking in a Brooklyn accent all the time, then we should try to figure out what’s going on. Does that sound fair?”</p><p class="double">“Sure, I’m fine with that.” Twilight rose from her seat “But you still haven’t answered my first question – where do we go from here?”</p><p class="double">“Well, once Solomon tells us whether you’re in or not, we should make sure to be packed early. Other than that, make sure Josie was up to date with her homework before you arrived? You don’t want to be kept out of the tournament for so...” Yami started, but was cut off by the clattering of the chair Twilight had been leaning on falling to the ground.</p><p class="double">“Oh god, no! I’m going to miss the tourn...” was all they could make out from her insane rambling before the front door swung shut behind her as she started to run home.</p><p class="double">“She needs to sort out her priorities...” Yami said, his mind still trying to figure out exactly what had happened.</p><p class="double">“You said it...” Tea nodded in agreement.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">79.6 (namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re Spike&#039;s <i>biological mother</i> in this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So that makes you my mother-in-law?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">79.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three pairs of eyes glared at Trixie.</p><p class="double">&quot;We tapped the trees,&quot; Sweetie Belle said, &quot;and didn&#039;t get a drop on us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We carried th&#039; full buckets from th&#039; forest inta Ponyville,&quot; Applebloom continued. &quot;It took us seventeen trips.

You really want to know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy grinned. &quot;Wow, nobody ever really seemed interested before. Sure, I&#039;ll tell you!&quot; She set her bag down and led Twilight to a puddle.</p><p class="double">&quot;When I was really young, I got super interested in how pegasai can stand on clouds, but other ponies can&#039;t. I remember being so shocked when I learned clouds were nothing but water, and we could make them!&quot; she giggled. &quot;Anyway, I got to thinking. What <i>else</i> is made of water?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Ice?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bubbles! Oh this is so cool, I haven&#039;t done it in ages! Watch this!&quot; Ditzy grinned, placing a hoof on the surface of the puddle. She took a deep breath, and then slowly lifted her hoof.</p><p class="double">The water came with her. A moment later, she was holding an apple sized bubble in the air. &quot;Hee hee, I&#039;ve still got it! But that&#039;s not even the best part, check this out!&quot; she winked, letting the bubble go, where it bobbed lightly in place. Quickly making more and tossing them around, the air was soon full of almost perfectly still bubbles. Ditzy took a deep breath, then flapped upwards and landed on one.</p><p class="double">It held her weight perfectly.</p><p class="double">Twilight couldn&#039;t help but smile as the beaming mailmare hopped from bubble to bubble, happy to share her skill with someone. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.2 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A shrill whistle halted the mad scramble of Ponyville residents to escape from the advance of the &#039;witch of Everfree&#039; Zecora as she entered town. All eyes stared as the local librarian and student of Celestia, Twilight Sparkle, dressed in the uniform of the constabulary, approached the cloaked pony figure purposefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Zecora of Everfree?&quot; Twilight inquired in a way that demanded a response.</p><p class="double">&quot;That is my name that you say,&quot; the figure removed her hood, revealing the striped mane and coat beneath. &quot;What can I do for you this day?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You are charged with no less than 2,527 counts of illicit rhyming,&quot; Twilight declared to the confusion of all watching, &quot;at least 324 of which are believed to be in the aid of spells and conjurations. I&#039;m going to have to ask you to come with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora responded by bringing a small flat rectangular object out of her cloak and hoofing it over to the unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Twilight exclaimed after examining the object for a moment. &quot;Well if you have a poetic license, that&#039;s fine. Sorry to have bothered you.&quot;</p><p class="double">The residents of Ponyville stared as Twilight trotted purposefully away after returning the object to Zecora, wondering what the buck had just happened.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy grinned. &quot;Wow, nobody ever really seemed interested before. Sure, I&#039;ll tell you! It&#039;s not that exciting though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s fine, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, okay...&quot; Ditzy giggled. &quot;As you may know... I&#039;m kinda clumsy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Really? I hadn&#039;t noticed...&quot; Twilight smiled awkwardly.</p><p class="double">Ditzy didn&#039;t seem to catch it. &quot;Well... I am. I can&#039;t really build things, I&#039;m not that great with weather, and accidents just seem to follow me around...&quot; she sighed. She grinned after a moment though. &quot;But if you need something cleaned, ho boy!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, so those are-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, soap bubbles! And let me tell you, I would not trade it for the world. You would not believe how hard Dinky can fight to get out of a bath!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.3 (yannoshka)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s good mood quickly evaporated as she entered into Mac&#039;s bar and found all eyes upon her. Celestia was at the center with a wide smile and a photo album in her hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Guest anchor?&quot; Twilight asked her former mentor tiredly, and the widening of the sun mare&#039;s smile was all the answer she needed.</p><p class="double">She groaned, and beelined straight for the bar where Mac already prepared her a little something fairly alcoholic to help her cope.</p><p class="double">Fortified with a downed drink in her belly, she turned back to her erstwhile friend and asked:</p><p>&quot;What did my nonawake self do this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">By this point Celestia&#039;s smile was worthy of Pinkie Pie at her party crazed worst.</p><p class="double">&quot;It is not so much what she did as... Well, take a look and I&#039;ll try to explain it in a bit.&quot; The sun diarch handed the album to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Dreading what she would see, the equestrian anchor opened the album and blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You see, the alicornification was a bit more angelic in nature that loop, and while me and Luna only had to deal with a few extra pairs of wings... Well, you looked more cherubic&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight was looking at a full body photo of herself with four pairs of wings - and two more heads, one with bovine horns and one hornless. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Ditzy grinned. &quot;Wow, nobody ever really seemed interested before. Sure, I&#039;ll tell you! You know how in comic books when someone is thinking, they use a thought balloon instead of a speech bubble?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Wait, you mean-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can read minds!&quot; Ditzy whispered with a wild grin. &quot;And it <i>was</i> nice of you to take an interest, even if it was more out of curiosity than a desire to get to know me. Good luck with that time loop thingie of yours! I&#039;d stick around to chat, but I need to get back to work.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.4 (Scygnus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Usually, Twilight kept a firm handle on what changes she&#039;d made in a loop. She knew what every little step could and would change things.</p><p class="double">Like just about everything else, however, when Derpy Hooves/Ditzy Doo was involved, it broke down.</p><p class="double">Twilight honestly hadn&#039;t even thought twice about saying hello to the mailmare on the way by during her first trip through Ponyville. Derpy had said hello back and kept on. No other reaction. But, since she couldn&#039;t find any other divergences from baseline, it must have been that idle hello that caused... this.</p><p class="double">&quot;I, for one, welcome our new adorable overlord.&quot; Fluttershy quipped, looking far too amused in her quiet way. The other four just looked like they were all out of facehoofs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ponies of Equestria! I present to you... Princess Dinky Doo!&quot; Celestia announced, looking as bewildered as Twilight felt. Behind them, stuffed in various degrees of finery, Discord, Chrysalis, and Sombra, none of whom were Awake, seemed unsure as to whether they should be confused, angry, or amused.</p><p class="double">&quot;YAAAAAAAAAAY I&#039;m a Princess mommy!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Muffin!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Say Ditzy, Just what <i>does</i> your cutie mark mean anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy glanced up from her delivery list, &quot;Huh?

Sure, I&#039;ll tell you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know how each bubble is an almost exact duplicate of each other? Well..,&quot; the grey mailmare concentrated and with a loud poof, she turned into seven Pinkie Pies. Two Pinkie clones had wings and one was a unicorn. Instead of balloons, they each had a singular bubble as a cutie mark.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle stared in open mouthed astonishment as one of the Ditzy Pies continued, &quot;let&#039;s just say that Pinkie Pie had experimented with the Mirror Pool before.&quot;</p><p class="double">Another Ditzy Pie continued, &quot;And that it took her a while to remember the correct activation phrase.&quot;</p><p class="double">A third Ditzy Pie finished with, &quot;And she got distracted by the edible slightly-hallucinagenic glowing mushrooms growing in that cave.&quot;</p><p class="double">All the Ditzy Pies chorused, &quot;Repeatedly.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought for a moment, &quot;I guess that explains your eyes. It&#039;s easier for all of you to divide your attention so that you can look in two different directions at once.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Ditzy collective nodded, &quot;Yup!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.5 (Namar13766)</p><p class="double">Twlight Sparkle knew she should have shown more tact and restraint at Rainbow Dash being poison joked.

She took a long pull from the &quot;Storyteller&#039;s Special&quot; Berry had taught Mac for when she wasn&#039;t looping.</p><p class="double">&quot;How the HAY did you get a boring baseline loop to sound that epic?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked.</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled. &quot;I like how Zecora was the only one talking normally in it.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double">Ditzy closed her eyes in quiet pensive contemplation, &quot;Alright, I can tell you. Here, hold my mail bag and stand back.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took the bag and a few steps backwards.</p><p class="double">&quot;Farther.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight went back even more.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, you should be safe there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Safe? What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy shouted across the distance so that Twilight could hear, &quot;My cutie mark is a molecule without any bonds! I don&#039;t like actually actively using it, but my special talent is entropy! Watch!&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the mailmare concentrated and suddenly everything around her in a ten foot radius was destroyed. Where the bubble of disintegration touched, the tree trunks cracked, splintered and toppled. The shrubs and bushes withered and died before vanishing completely. Even the ground collapsed into a sinkhole.</p><p class="double">Then Ditzy stopped her powers and flew down near Twilight, &quot;I.. I understand if you don&#039;t want to talk or see or be near me any more.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked in confusion, &quot;Why won&#039;t I want to do those things? You&#039;re still a friend, Ditzy. And my mailmare. Although, it does explain a few things. If you were an earth pony, you&#039;d have the special talent of touch of destruction. If you were a unicorn, you&#039;d have a disintegration beam spell as your specialty. But since you&#039;re a pegasus, your power leaks constantly out of your wings. That&#039;s why things break so easily around you!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy nodded, &quot;And why being a mailmare never lets me stay in the same place long enough for things to destabilize, usually. Twilight, did you really mean that? That you won&#039;t mind being around me even though you know what I can do now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course I meant it! You&#039;re my friend and a very nice pony. I&#039;d never abandon any pony just because their special talent is scary, as long as they didn&#039;t use it to hurt others intentionally,&quot; Twilight said with confidence.</p><p class="double">And Ditzy found that a smile was slowly spreading across her face.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.7 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash did not like the look in Twilight&#039;s eye when she entered Mac&#039;s Bar. She especially didn&#039;t like it when Twilight <i>smiled</i> at her in the way she realized meant she was planning a prank.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, Dash. New expansion loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The weather mare swallowed nervously. &quot;I didn&#039;t do anything too bad, did I?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s grin went from malevolent to playful. &quot;Well, you didn&#039;t <i>dress in style</i>...&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash winced. The G3 loops were still a sore point for her.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s smile stayed but warmed gently. &quot;You aced the Wonderbolts Reserves Entrance Exam. But how you did it... Oh-ho, does that open up plenty of prank opportunities. I&#039;m surprised I never noticed it before the expansion, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash began to sweat nervously. This was going to be heck for the next few dozen loops she was Awake. Hopefully Twilight would burn out on the pranks against her non-Awake self. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double">Ditzy grinned, &quot;Wow, nobody ever really seemed interested before. Sure, I&#039;ll tell you! The bubbles represent other universes. I can see through to alternate realities. I haven&#039;t figured out how to actually travel to any of them yet, but one time I did managed to snag something from one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight was amazed, &quot;Really?! What did you get?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy smiled, &quot;Haven&#039;t you ever wondered why Dinky has the exact same color eyes and mane as me while most foals look nothing like their parents? The coat is a little different shade, but alternate realities are like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight connected the dots, &quot;She&#039;s you! She&#039;s a younger unicorn version of you from another Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy nodded sadly, &quot;The last survivor, actually. She was stuck in an air balloon while the ground was completely covered with Smooze. She was starving and terrified. I had to get her out of there. I just had to.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.8 (Opus J)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once again, Nightmare Moon stood before Ponyville, and cries of horror were all around Twilight was planning a baseline run, even though Spike was awake, but so far everything was going according to plan.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi!&quot;</p><p class="double">...Until Derpy stepped up. Twilight froze for a moment, then shifted her eyes to Spike, who had snuck away a few moments ago. <i>What in the world?...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;And what exactly are you supposed to be doing?&quot; The near-eldritch Pony Abomination asked in a mocking tone.</p><p class="double">&quot;This!&quot; And with that word, Derpy opened her mouth and... Blew out a bubble. One that enveloped Nightmare Moon, somehow fitting her into a sphere without any seeming difficulty. For a moment, the whole Hall went silent. Then Derpy turned and bucked the bubble, popping it - and sending Nightmare Moon spinning and bouncing around the room. A moment later she slammed into the floor - and where once had been the Mare of the Moon, Luna lay Dazed - Right next to a muffin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Spike...&quot; Twilight said in a rather annoyed tone of voice. &quot;Where in the world did...?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Dragon smiled. &quot;I met a few new friends last loop. Kind of weird, but they gave me a copy of their source material...&quot; He held out a cartridge. &quot;I couldn&#039;t help myself - and besides, I promised to get him a copy of this window for the copy of the game. Want to Play?&quot; He grinned at her, Shaking the game in his grip. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy grinned, &quot;Wow, nobody ever really seemed interested before.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she just sat there. Twilight looked on expectantly.</p><p class="double">Ditzt continued to sit there, with a goofy smile on her face.</p><p class="double">The lavender pony finally asked, &quot;So... about your cutie mark?</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right. What my cutie mark means?&quot; Ditzy said. Twilight leaned forward in expectation.</p><p class="double">Then the mailmare chirped, &quot;I have no idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight overbalanced and fell head first into the ground. She got up and dusted herself off, &quot;You have no idea what your cutie mark means?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a clue,&quot; said Ditzy happily.</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you get it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... don&#039;t remember,&quot; Ditzy continued smiling.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the grey pegasus in stunned silence.</p><p class="double">Ditzy stared at Twilight.</p><p class="double">Then, with a faint derp noise, Ditzy&#039;s eye went separate ways.</p><p class="double">And so did Twilight&#039;s. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.9 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re not <i>were-</i>wolves.&quot; Twilight said, her form that of an oddly bipedal wolf. &quot;We&#039;re <i>why</i>-wolves. Creatures possessed by the spirit... of inquiry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Finn and Jake glanced at each other, then back at the Why-wolf. &quot;Uhh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Twilight asked in her body&#039;s deeper, husky voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s just... this usually ends differently.&quot; Finn muttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you&#039;re <i>not </i>a murder-monster?&quot; Jake asked bluntly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, heavens no. I would never hurt anything that wasn&#039;t trying to hurt me first.&quot; Twilight waved his concerns away.</p><p class="double">Finn rubbed his bare chin and wondered. &quot;Huh... so that&#039;s wierd... Hey wait, are you a looper?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, are you Awake? Yes, I&#039;m my loop&#039;s Anchor!&quot; She replied cheerfully. &quot;We&#039;re usually ponies. Equestria, you know?&quot;</p><p class="double">Jake pawed his forehead. &quot;THAT explains Lady Rainisus!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is <i>SO COOL!&quot;</i> Rainbow Dash shouted as she zoomed past overhead, changing the colors of anything nearby.</p><p class="double">Twilight carefully removed her glasses, and then pawed her muzzle to rub at her eyes. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy looked downcast at the ground for a few moments, &quot;Nobody ever really seemed interested before. I thought it would be a little longer before... Twilight, please - please take care of Dinky for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that said, Ditzy popped like a soap bubble, leaving behind nothing except a slightly disgruntled Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">Twilight waited in the clearing. A moment passed. Then another.</p><p class="double">Then Ditzy reappeared. However, she now sported a horn in addition to her wings.</p><p class="double">&quot;Behold, I have ascended into an alicorn,&quot; Ditzy announced regally, &quot;As a new princess of Equestria, I would be unable to give Dinky a life free from castle intrigue and away from the many jealous enemies that I am sure to acquire. It falls upon you, Twilight Sparkle, to..&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a loud sigh and then flashed. Suddenly she had a set of wings of her own. This was a strange loop and she had hoped Ditzy&#039;s talent would be something unique or exceptional due to a certain fact, &quot;Yes, I&#039;m an alicorn, too. Every pony is an alicorn. For some reason, any pony can ascend just by sneezing wrong. We all hide it because none of us actually want to rule and to make Celestia and Luna feel special. The last time a pony accidentally ruined the masquerade, we got Princess Cadance - and now she&#039;s stuck in the middle of the frozen north ruling an empire a thousand years out of date.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So every pony is an alicorn?&quot; Ditzy was shocked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It usually happens to every pony after they obtain their cutie mark. They&#039;re told on their cutecenara.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I never had one. My parents were too busy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, &quot;I figured as much. Cadance was an orphan. We usually try to let the ponies like you know in secret, someplace out of the way. At least you had the good sense not to run up to the Princesses and yell out, &#039;Look! Look what happened to me!&#039; like some foal sitter-turned-princess I know.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.10 (Goldude)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For a Looper such as Rainbow Dash, it was hard not to know about the history of The Wonderbolts.</p><p class="double">&quot;The initials E.U.P. stand for what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Earth, Unicorn, and Pegasi. They&#039;re the Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">However, for a Looper such as Rainbow Dash, it was hard to tell <i>which</i> history she should be studying for. Twilight continued, &quot;While it&#039;s true that three ponies collectively formed The Wonderbolts, E.U.P. stands for the names of the three pegasi who founded them. East Wind, Updrift, and Pulse Storm. Now, can you tell me why they formed The Wonderbolts?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash hesitated as she filtered through her memories. &quot;Uh... They got drunk one night and woke up in Saddle Arabia. Normally, that would be impossible, but The Wonderbolts are all about impossible. Updrift had somehow sold his wing to a Diamond Dog and needed it back, so the three went into their territory. An accidental conversation later, and East Wind was now married to the queen of Diamond Dogs.</p><p class="double">The queen ordered them to travel over to Griffaltar in order to steal their weather gem. They had to obey under threat of death. Sadly, on their way over to Griffaltar, they got sidetracked and somehow wound up in Zebrica, where they mistakenly gave the zebras a disease they weren&#039;t accustomed to. The zebras started to go into comas, unable to deal with the fact that their kind weren&#039;t meant to hold magic.</p><p class="double">In order to find a way to help them, the three proceeded to head back to Equestria with a Zebra&#039;s tail, for DNA purposes. Things went well until they finally found the cure for the zebras. They had totally forgotten about The Diamond Dogs, which had started invading Canterlot and taking ponies hostage until their demands were reached. E.U.P. collectively had enough and went on to form a military division to stop the Diamond Dogs, rescue all the hostages, and drive out the invaders.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash blinked. &quot;Huh? But-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The three were ordered by Princess Luna to create a military unit because she was feeling lazy about keeping the peace.&quot;</p><p class="double">Again, it was hard to tell which history she should be studying. &quot;Screw it, I&#039;ll fail this loop and try again next one. I&#039;m going to Big Mac&#039;s bar.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double">Ditzy looked downcast at the ground for a few moments, &quot;Nobody ever really seemed interested before. I thought it would be a little longer before... Twilight, please - please take care of Dinky for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that said, Ditzy popped like a soap bubble, leaving behind nothing except an utterly horrified Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ta-da!&quot; Ditzy said happily as she walked out from behind a tree.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at her aghast, &quot;What!? You&#039;re alive!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Ditzy replied, &quot;Sorry it was so shocking, but you&#039;re Twilight Sparkle. You hang out with Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie. If my prank was even a little bit less than convincing, you would have never fallen for it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But.. but how?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My special talent is making animated bubbles. See,&quot; Ditzy took a deep breath and blew out a large spit bubble. It wobbled a little in the air, and then took the exact likeness of Twilight Sparkle, herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s very interesting,&quot; Twilight said looking at her bubble clone, &quot;And a little bit gross.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know!&quot; said her bubble clone in Ditzy&#039;s voice. Then it popped.</p><p class="double">Ditzy spoke up, &quot;I know how to throw my voice, but I can&#039;t do accurate impressions all that well. My talent&#039;s isn&#039;t that great for most things, but Dinky loves my bubble puppet theater plays.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.11 </p><p class="double">Twilight looked around. She was... on a train, by the rocking motion of the seat under her.</p><p class="double">There was a human boy of about mid-teens sitting opposite her – <i>oh, hey, I&#039;m human too. That could be a warning sign, loops like this often go south – </i>and he was looking curiously at her.</p><p class="double">“Are you okay, Katniss? What-”</p><p class="double">Twilight held up a hand. “Hold on a minute, please.”</p><p class="double">Loop memories. Loop memories...</p><p class="double">The loop memories arrived.</p><p class="double"><i>RIGHT.</p><p class="double"></i>She snapped her fingers. “<i>Buck</i> this loop. OWL?”</p><p class="double"><i>Stand by, ready. Set up.</p><p class="double"></i>“Buster-three. Flier Fin.”</p><p class="double">The boy opposite her was frowning. “What are you doing? Where&#039;d that bracelet come from?”</p><p class="double">She ignored him. Explanations later.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, Princess of Magic, archmage, Anchor, and friendship specialist, was <i>pissed off.</p><p class="double"></i>Most of her considerable natural power was bound up in her various equiform states, which had natural aptitude at magic. Purely as a matter of ease, she&#039;d learned to channel her magic most easily through a horn.</p><p class="double">When she was human, she had to work through implements, for the most part. Oerth magic could be used by bare hands, but it required a laundry list of components, and circumventing them was costly and tricky... unless she was a unicorn, in which case it was easier.</p><p class="double">But there were <i>always</i> workarounds. Especially if she was annoyed enough.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle blasted through the roof of the train in a corona of pure magic strong enough to be almost opaque to conventional vision. Wand in one hand, OWL in staff-form in the other, ethereal wings sprouting from her ankles and a Barrier Jacket which could probably withstand a moderately sized city buster constituting itself out of thin air around her, she shot south and west towards the Capitol along the line of the rail.</p><p class="double">Incidentally, the air around her happened to be on fire.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, anyway, to ease the transition a little, I made the Hunger Games weekly,” Twilight concluded.</p><p class="double">Mac blinked. “Wait, what? Beggin&#039; yer pardon, miss Sparkle, but ah thought y&#039;all said-”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I also put that enchantment from Flonyard on the arena. It&#039;s amazing how much a little no-death enchantment can turn a murderfest into genuinely fun entertainment for all the family.”</p><p class="double">She took a deep gulp of Frenzywater, wincing as it scorched her throat. “That said, I hope to not have to deal with monsters like that for a good few thousand years...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy looked downcast at the ground for a few moments, &quot;Nobody ever really seemed interested before. I thought it would be a little longer before... Twilight, please - please take care of Dinky for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that said, Ditzy popped like a soap bubble, leaving behind nothing except an utterly horrified Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">Twilight backed up in fear, but the rock she accidentally stepped on also popped.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is going on here?&quot; Twilight said out loud. She carefully touched a nearby bush, only for it to pop as well.</p><p class="double">Cautiously, the lavender unicorn lowered her head and then used her horn to stab at large tree. With a faint snap, the tree popped into nothingness.</p><p class="double">Then Twilight found two large buckets, each chock full of experience points. Unfortunately, they were encased in vast amounts of bubble wrap.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is stupid!&quot; Twilight Sparkle exclaimed as she slapped down her character sheet and multifaceted dice onto the table, &quot;Who votes that Pokey Pierce can no longer be game master?&quot;</p><p class="double">Every hoof except Pokey&#039;s went up in the air.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then it&#039;s settled,&quot; Twilight said as she looked over the ponies that had gathered for game night. Lickety Split was eating his bowl of ice cream, Bon-bon had passed around her candies, and Ditzy was using her talent to make her apple juice all fizzy. Celestia&#039;s student continued, &quot;How about we give Lyra&#039;s &#039;Humans and Handymen&#039; game system a try next?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.12 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was intrigued by this variant. The Unawake Fluttershy apparently had a regular musical performance schedule, usually with trained animal backup. She was still shy in social situations, and she wouldn&#039;t perform outside of Ponyville, but on stage in front of ponies she knew? She was a great singer. In fact, she was on her way to the next performance right now, making sure her recording spell was functioning properly. She wanted to have an album to take with her after this Loop ended.</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you heard?&quot; Twilight heard somepony, Vinyl Scratch it sounded like, whisper to another nearby. &quot;Fluttershy&#039;s going to play <i>rap</i> music!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. Able to take the stage or not, that sounded a little... <i>bold</i> for the shy pegasus. But either way it should prove entertaining, so she took her spot in the audience.</p><p class="double">The curtain rose, the music began, and Twilight facehooved as she saw Fluttershy&#039;s animal backup this time.</p><p class="double">She was playing <i>rat</i> music. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy looked downcast at the ground for a few moments, &quot;Nobody ever really seemed interested before. I thought it would be a little longer before... Twilight, please - please take care of Dinky for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that said, Ditzy popped like a soap bubble, leaving behind nothing except a mildly distraught Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi Dinky. Your mom exploded for some reason,&quot; Twilight monotoned to the little filly once she reached Ditzy&#039;s house, &quot;She asked me to take care of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sheesh,&quot; Dinky huffed, &quot;She did it to you, too? It&#039;s like Mom will do anything for free foal sitting. Her special talent is creating atmospheric illusions - mirages. If you want to talk to her, she&#039;s probably at the movies. I should be alright on my own.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t mind staying with you, Dinky. How about we play a board game?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, that&#039;s okay,&quot; the little unicorn waved her hoof, &quot;I&#039;m sorry mom is such a big jerk this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s head whipped around, &quot;What did you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, I didn&#039;t say anything,&quot; Dinky scrunched her mouth, her eyes shifting from one side to the other.</p><p class="double">Twilight continued to stare at the little filly.</p><p class="double">Dinky suddenly tapped herself on her chest, &quot;Enterprise, one to beam up!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked on as the little unicorn vanished in a flash of blue. Then she told the universe exactly how she felt about this particular loop, &quot;Ugh!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.13 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Kakashi looked over his new team and sighed. They had tried doing D ranks until the Hokage made the repairs to the collateral damage they always caused come out of Kakashi&#039;s own personal funds.</p><p class="double">Weeding garden? The weeds, most of the garden, and parts of the house were currently in low Earth orbit heading for Cloud, thanks to Trixie&#039;s modified &#039;weeds only&#039; explosive tags.</p><p class="double">Catching Tora? Completed due to Pinkie&#039;s secret recipe drugged tuna cakes, which happened to wear off just as Kakashi was handing off the cat to its owner - with the added benefits of increasing Tora&#039;s aggression, speed, and size. And claw sharpness. And letting it breathe fire, somehow.</p><p class="double">Painting a fence? Kakashi didn&#039;t really want to remember what happened that mission. All he knew was that people were still trying to remove a stray fence post lodged in the mountain up the second Hokage&#039;s stone nostril.</p><p class="double">The sad thing was that Team Demolition, as his students were now called, actually worked and cared for each other like a team should. It was just that no mission ended like they were supposed to. </p><p class="double">Kakashi remembered the introductions.</p><p class="double">&quot;Howdy. My name is Applejack. My folks are a distant branch member of the Senju family that decided to settle down and run an orchard rather than do the ninja thing. Since things are pretty good on the farm, my little sis and I decided to off and join the ninja academy. I&#039;m pretty strong and I can do a little bit of the wood chakra thing, but I&#039;m better at earth manipulation. My favorite technique is making a giant club made of ultra-dense compressed earth and fighting with it. Guess that means I&#039;m training to be a taijutsu expert with a bit of ninjutsu thrown in. I like apples, good friends, and honesty. I don&#039;t like it when people lie just because they can or to hurt others.&quot;</p><p class="double">It was like she said, Kakashi thought. Applejack was massively strong for a genin and she could eventually develop Tsunade-level strength. She was fast and her mastery of earth jutsu was impressive. She would have been a perfect samurai. However, she had absolutely no talent for deception. He still cringed when he remember her attempt in a later kunoichi seduction class. &quot;Howdy, my name is Apple.. not.. jack, and I&#039;m anything except a Konoha ninja. Pleased ta meet ya!&quot; </p><p class="double">However, if he wanted guile and deception, there was always.. her.</p><p class="double">&quot;The name is Trixie, soon to be the great and powerful. At the age of five, I ran away to Konoha from a nearby circus that just happened to be on fire from mysterious circumstances that I know nothing about and were definitely not caused by one such as me. My strengths lie in my fabulous genjutsu and I have been studying seals for years now. My pride and joy are these gloves that can emit an explosive note level blast from the palms if I hold them like this.. OHNO! Hold on, sensei! I&#039;ll put the flames out! And a few illusions and your hair will even out again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Finally, there was his last student. The the living embodiment of a headache.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie! My family is a branch of the Akimichi clan. I love making others happy and seeing them smile and baking tasty treats and the way the sky looks in the morning and, oh I know! I&#039;ve made everyone some ninja cookies. They&#039;re like little shirukens, and you can actually reenforce them with chakra and throw them, but you can also eat them since they&#039;re so tasty. So very tasty.. Mphhfhh dhntsh rithke bthhphht!&quot;</p><p class="double">Whatever else Pinkie was saying was lost as she had stuffed her mouth with a multitude of her own shiruken cookies and was trying to speak while eating them all at once, much to the disgust of Kakashi and her new teammates. </p><p class="double">Apparently instead of growing larger and stronger the more she ate, Pinkie became faster. She had blinding speed - so fast it looked like she was teleporting at times, because there was absolutely no way Kakahsi&#039;s brain would accept that a little pink genin could have perfected his sensei&#039;s signature yellow flash technique. This, coupled with her high level strength, durability, ability to be one of the most stealthy ninja Kakashi had ever seen despite constantly wearing highlighter pink and pastel blue, a propensity and chakra supply for making several shadow clones whenever she felt like it, and a danger sense that bordered on precognitive made Kakashi put her skills into the low jonin level. That is, if his suspicions proved false and that Pinkie wasn&#039;t actually hiding the majority of her abilities. Otherwise, well, Kakashi wasn&#039;t broken enough yet to believe in such a possibility yet. </p><p class="double">In fact, his student would have been the perfect ninja if not for one thing. Pinkie Pie was a consummate pacifist. She refused to kill and wouldn&#039;t even hurt the worst of people if she could avoid it. To try and fix this, he had assigned her a solo C level mission of completely eliminating a bandit hideout.</p><p class="double">Watching concealed from a nearby tree, Kakashi saw as Pinkie Pie appeared in the middle of the camp and promptly threw all the panicking bandits a giant party. It took the hardened men a long while to stop panicking, trying to attack her - which never worked, or trying to escape - Pinkie, or a Pinkie clone, would appear in their path and suddenly they would be back at the party. Eventually, Pinkie announced that as of now, everyone is no longer a bandit, but instead a worker at her candy factory on the outskirts of Konoha - which they also had to build first. Since there were only candy workers and no bandits around anymore, she didn&#039;t have to eliminate anyone. Mission success!</p><p class="double">The candy factory had been built and all the ex-bandits seemed to be settling into their new roles. A few of the worst did try to escape early on during the construction, but they never got far. There had been no further breakout attempts after Pinkie announced that the escapees had been found and retired and are now happily living on a distant farm somewhere, or at least that&#039;s what the nice but slightly gross ninja covered in blood had told her.</p><p class="double">Kakashi looked over his three students once again, &quot;Congratulations. You&#039;re all going into the next chunin exam. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll all do very well. As always, try not to destroy the village.&quot;</p><p class="double">Over all the cheering, Kakashi really hoped that they would all get promoted. Promoted and possibly get assigned an extremely long duration mission someplace not very flammable and far, far away from him.</p><p class="double">Then came a distant cry that the entire village was slowly learning to hate and fear, &quot;Ninja Sage Crusaders: Stone Mason Experts!&quot;</p><p class="double">This cry was shortly followed by a loud &#039;Oops!&#039; as the first Hokage&#039;s stone face slowly slid down the mountainside. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued( Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Say Ditzy, Just what <i>does</i> your cutie mark mean anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy glanced up from her delivery list, &quot;Huh? You really want to know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy grinned, &quot;Wow, nobody ever really seemed interested before. Sure, I&#039;ll tell you! It&#039;s what&#039;s in my head!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gaped at the self-depreciating remark as she considered how mean some ponies had to have been to convince her of that. It was so sa–</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Ditzy cut off her thoughts, &quot;I&#039;m serious. Watch.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that, the wall-eyed mailmare put her hoof over her mouth and blew, puffing out her cheeks comically and causing a stream of bubbles to shoot out her ears.</p><p class="double">&quot;O...kay,&quot; Twilight did her best to wrap her mind around that one. &quot;I was not expecting that.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.14 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Naruto&#039;s smirk was a little unsettling to Kakashi&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now that you&#039;re officially cleared for training by the Stripe-kage -&quot; Naruto began.</p><p class="double">Kakashi interrupted him with a raised hoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;Stripe-kage?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Where did you think she learned Mokuton from?&quot; Naruto retorted, &quot;Now where was I? <i>Ahem</i>...now that you&#039;re okay to train, I can finally show you the secret of using jutsu when you don&#039;t have fingers! But first, to celebrate your recovery, we&#039;ve got a little...test.&quot;</p><p class="double">If the smirk had been unsettling, the grin Naruto had on now was downright disturbing. Kakashi hid his nervousness well as Naruto reached into his mane and pulled out...a pair of tiny, jingling bells.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You&#039;re kidding me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Naruto laughed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope! As the newest member of Looping Team Seven, its only fitting that you pass the bell test before I can train you! These are even the original bells, see? I have a couple...hundred...thousand copies of them of stashed away in my pocket. I can easily spare some for our test.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Kakashi watched, Naruto awkwardly tied the bells into his mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you want me to come at you with intent to kill?&quot; Kakashi asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, considering that right now your best intent to kill me really won&#039;t do diddly-squat to me, it&#039;s up to you,&quot; Naruto replied, &quot;Let&#039;s just say &#039;If it&#039;s stupid and it works, it wasn&#039;t stupid&#039;. I&#039;ll even promise not to fly so you won&#039;t be too outmatched.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re enjoying this far too much.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course!&quot; Naruto laughed, &quot;Ne, Kakashi, you can start whenever you -&quot;</p><p class="double">His words were cut off as Naruto had to jump out of the way of a silvery blur. It resolved into Kakashi, leg outstretched a hoof strike. Which, Naruto realized, had been aimed for his head. Kakashi eye-smiled at the shocked expression on Naruto&#039;s face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Zecora must have forgotten to mention that I&#039;ve been training my pony-style taijutsu with Silver Spoon,&quot; Kakashi said as innocently as he could manage.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah...guess so,&quot; Naruto replied, his smile returning.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Kakashi was exhausted, and it was showing. Naruto, not so much, but the pegasus was clearly having trouble holding himself back.</p><p class="double">Over the last hour, Naruto had gotten a painful reminder that new to looping or not, unfamiliar with fighting in a pony body or otherwise, Kakashi Hatake was still a leaf-damned <i>Jounin</i> and Might Gai&#039;s <i>Eternal Rival</i> for a leaf-damned <i>reason</i>.</p><p class="double">The only trouble was that Naruto still had the bells. And chasing Naruto around this clearing all day was doing very little to change that.</p><p class="double">&quot;We can always try this again tomorrow,&quot; Naruto called out, seeing how Kakashi was starting to look a little wobbly on his hooves, &quot;You&#039;re already doing great, Kakashi! No need to push yourself too far when you&#039;ve just gotten better right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Tempting. Realistically, pacing himself on this would be the smart decision. There were still years until their time in Equestria was scheduled to end. And after that would be more loops. <i>Countless</i> more loops, if Naruto&#039;s experience was anything to judge by. Kakashi could take his time, build his strength back up.</p><p class="double">Yeah, <i>no</i>.</p><p class="double">Naruto, apparently taking the silence as agreement, turned to head back to Ponyville. At that moment Kakashi <i>flung</i> himself forward. He crashed in a heap a dozen feet <i>past</i> his target.</p><p class="double">&quot;What - Kakashi!&quot;</p><p class="double">Naruto flew over immediately, panicking. But Kakashi was...laughing? And he was holding something in his teeth, something that jingled. Naruto checked his mane - yep, the bells were gone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Kakashi-sensei, you <i>idiot</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...basically, it&#039;s all mental,&quot; Naruto finished.</p><p class="double">Kakashi nodded. &quot;So the reason I was able to body flicker at the end was -&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because you don&#039;t normally use hand signs for that anyway, and you wanted it bad enough that you were able to overcome the whole &#039;<i>I&#039;m not in my real body</i>&#039; mental block,&quot; Naruto nodded, &quot;It takes a lot of practice before you can use complicated jutsu, but the simplest things - or at least stuff you already use all the time anyway - are a cinch. Take me, for example. I was throwing around Shadow Clones right away.&quot;</p><p class="double">To show off, Naruto promptly poofed two clones into existence.</p><p class="double">&quot;But even transforming took a lot longer for me to relearn,&quot; Naruto added, as the two clones demonstrated a transformation.</p><p class="double">For lack of any other ideas, Naruto&#039;s clones turned into Sasuke and Sakura - human-shaped of course, since Kakashi had no way to recognize their pony forms. He was about explain further about the mental techniques when the Sakura-shaped clone violently gagged. Both the remaining clone, Naruto, and Kakashi were shocked to see a hoof impaled directly into that clone&#039;s chest - right where the heart would have been if the clone had really been Sakura.</p><p class="double">Kakashi especially was surprised, because it was his hoof doing the impaling.</p><p class="double">The clearing was very quiet after the poor clone finally popped. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued( Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Say Ditzy, Just what <i>does</i> your cutie mark mean anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy glanced up from her delivery list, &quot;Huh? You really want to know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy grinned, &quot;Wow, nobody ever really seemed interested before. Sure, I&#039;ll tell you! It&#039;s my personality!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight waited for her to continue for a second before it sunk in. &quot;Wait, that&#039;s it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.13 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So are we a team yet?&quot; asked the purple haired girl.</p><p class="double">&quot;I really don&#039;t want to head on back to the academy,&quot; said the red headed girl, &quot;They don&#039;t seem to like us there all that much. Plus they still haven&#039;t really rebuilt all of the building after our last attempt at becoming ninja sages.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah!&quot; squeaked a grinning Sweetie Belle, &quot;I would hate to think what the council would do to you if you didn&#039;t pass us, Mizuki-san.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You all... pass,&quot; Honestly, it was the only thing Mizuki could say. He was now constantly wishing for incarceration in the T&amp;I department instead of being appointed team leader for this particular group. But the Hokage needed a teacher that was disposable at best, and he fit the bill. He had been told, in excruciating detail, exactly what would happen if he attempted to escape or even commit suicide. But as Mizuki watched his new genin team, now labeled &#039;Team Ninja Sage Crusaders&#039;, enthusiastically yell out their catch phrase; he wondered if being revived and then eaten by the shinigami would really be worse than teaching these three.</p><p class="double"></p><p>Kakashi heard the very familiar and very unwelcome voices and placed his palm over his face. Of course they would send those three to &#039;help&#039; him. They would use all sorts of excuses like how they had worked together as a team before, but the jonin was willing to bet his entire Icha-icha collection that the true reason was that they just wanted his former students out of the village as far and as often as possible.</p><p class="double">&quot;I really don&#039;t think that is what the abbreviation stands for, Pinkie,&quot; Applejack was heard saying as the three walked towards the clearing where Kakashi and his new team was waiting.</p><p class="double">Pinkie huffed, &quot;I remember what it stands for. I worked at the Tickle and Irritation department for a whole day, Applejack.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So what happened there?&quot; Trixie asked, &quot;Why didn&#039;t they want you back?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie tapped her finger to her chin, &quot;Well, they placed me in a room that had a bunch of prisoners behind a glass wall. Then, they had me just talk about some of the new desserts I wanted to invent. But in the evening, they told me that it was much too troublesome to have me do that every day. Apparently, they said that I was causing far too many attempted suicides. And that three of the attempts were by the guards. Then they gave me some money and sent me home.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded, &quot;I&#039;m proud to have survived a full two and a half minutes of weaponized Pinkie-babble before breaking. I still can&#039;t look on any sort of cherries without remembering. Oh, hey there, sensei!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, Kakashi!&quot; Pinkie Pie waved enthusiastically.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm, I don&#039;t remember seeing anyone that looks like this man,&quot; Trixie frowned, &quot;Are you sure we&#039;ve met before?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack gently tapped the pointed-hat-and-cloak-wearing ninja girl on her shoulder, &quot;Try to picture him on fire, screaming and flailing wildly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahh, Kakashi-sensei!&quot; Trixie exclaimed with a smile, &quot;Fancy meeting you again. Looks like your eyebrows are coming back nicely.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You three,&quot; Kakashi said by way of a greeting.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are these your new students?&quot; Applejack asked, &quot;I&#039;m Applejack. This here is Trixie and the one in the pink dress is Pinkie Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My name is Sakura. Pleased to meet you,&quot; said the unawake (thankfully) Sakura.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sasuke,&quot; the brooding Uchiha uttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m Naruto!&quot; said the loop anchor before looking at Pinkie Pie, who was leaning far into his personal space. She was examining every detail on his face, even sniffing him a few times. Naruto spoke up, &quot;Er.. what is she doing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shrugged, &quot;No idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie suddenly jumped back and pointed a finger at Naruto, &quot;It all makes sense now! The Uchiha massacre, the attempted kidnapping of the Hyuga heiress, Sakura&#039;s pink hair, the Kyuubi attack! I know your secret now, Naruto!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? What are you talking about?&quot; Naruto tried not to look at his overly interested teammates or the suddenly alarmed Kakashi.</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued, &quot;Your quick healing! Your animalistic features! Your insatiable hunger for ramen! It&#039;s quite obvious! Just like in my old dog-demon manga! You, Naruto, are a hanyou! A half-demon!&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone just sat there silent for a moment. Then, Sakura spoke up, &quot;That&#039;s stupid! We don&#039;t live in a manga.&quot;</p><p class="double">Naruto was attempting not to give Sakura the same look as the other three loopers while stealthily tapping on his stomach seal, trying to stifle the howling laughter inside his mind, &quot;No I&#039;m not! Why would you ever think such a thing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because it&#039;s plain to see what must have happened,&quot; Pinkie Pie launched into her explanation, &quot;Shortly after Naruto was born, a group of Konoha ninja were returning from a mission. There was a Uchiha on the team, and when their super freaky eyes saw Naruto, they knew what he was. The Uchiha wanted Naruto&#039;s power. They wanted him to become a ninja for Konoha, but Naruto&#039;s human parent refused to move. After the mission, that Uchiha snuck back and kidnapped baby Naruto, killing his parent in the processes. They took him back to Konoha and were planning to raise him as an Uchiha.</p><p class="double">&quot;But the Kyuubi returned. Seeing its mate slaughtered and its child missing, the demon grew to its full form and followed the trail back to the village. The Uchiha, not wanting to be blamed for the disaster, tossed Naruto into the nearest orphanage and claimed that he had been born that day. Then the fourth Hokage died killing the the Kyuube and life continued as normal. Right until Hinata Hyuga was almost kidnapped.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Hyuga also have super freaky eyes and they saw the Uchiha dump a half-demon baby into the orphanage right before the Kyuube attacked. They were willing to sit on this information so as not to destroy an entire clan and weaken the village, but then during the kidnapping, the Uchiha police turned out to be of absolutely no use. They didn&#039;t stop the kidnapper or prevent the death of Neji&#039;s dad. So in anger, they let loose the knowledge that the Kyuube attack happened entirely because of the Uchiha clan.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not wanting his clan to be remembered as complete traitors, Itachi took it upon himself to kill all of them, except for his brother. He tortured Sasuke because without the feelings of sympathy his suffering produced, Sasuke would have been known only as a traitor&#039;s brother and not the last brave survivor. And that&#039;s how everything happened. It&#039;s so obvious,&quot; Pinkie Pie finished speaking.</p><p class="double">Everyone sat there in silence except for Naruto&#039;s tapping, which had reached a rapid staccato beat as Kurama&#039;s howling laughter intensified.</p><p class="double">Sakura raised her hand, &quot;How does any of this ridiculous story explain my hair color?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It doesn&#039;t,&quot; Pinkie Pie chirped, &quot;I just really like pink.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy looked downcast at the ground for a few moments, &quot;Nobody ever really seemed interested before.

She&#039;s going to need somebody strong to lean on, and if I think too much about what happened to Derpy I won&#039;t be that pony.</i></p><p class="double">Dinky noticed the shadow over her and looked up at Twilight. &quot;Hello, Miss Sparkle!&quot; she said. &quot;How are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dinky...&quot; Twilight had to take another deep calming breath before she could continue. &quot;I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve got some bad news to tell you... about your mother.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dinky sighed, but it sounded to Twilight more like exasperation than sadness. &quot;She popped again, didn&#039;t she?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... what?&quot; Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">Dinky began walking with a steady, determined pace, and Twilight followed out of curiosity. It wasn&#039;t far to the humble cottage on the edge of town that Derpy had called home, and Ditzy walked straight inside, leaving Twilight to hesitate for several moments before following.</p><p class="double">Twilight found Dinky in the back of the cottage, standing on top of a stepladder next to a gigantic storage pot carved out of stone. Painted with sloppy strokes on the side of the stone urn was the word MOM. From behind the urn Dinky drew up an immense bubble wand in her teeth, the thing easily twice her own length, and with great effort marehandled it into the urn, stirring vigorously for a few seconds. Then with the greatest care she lifted the bubble wand out, a shining rainbow membrane clinging to the aperture.</p><p class="double">Slowly but firmly Dinky waved the wand, and an immense bubble formed. When it finally left the wand, it shrank in on itself, taking the shape and form of a familiar gray-coated, blonde-maned pegasus.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, Muffin!&quot; Derpy grinned. &quot;How was school?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you do it this time, Mom?&quot; Dinky asked. &quot;Thistle salad? Too long in the sauna at the spa? Forgot what F-R-A-G-I-L-E on a package means?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight just asked about my cutie mark,&quot; Derpy smiled. She looked from Dinky to Twilight and said, &quot;I hope my little muffin behaved while you were taking care of her. Thanks!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But... what? How? Why? That... I don&#039;t... how can...?&quot; All the questions in the world were holding a convention just behind Twilight&#039;s vocal chords, and the chairmare couldn&#039;t call the meeting to order.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gran&#039;ma was a Mirror Pool clone,&quot; Dinky said. &quot;Gran&#039;pa and then Dad had to restore Mom about once a week before I took over.&quot; She looked at her mother and added, &quot;I love Mom dearly, but I&#039;m hoping my cutie mark turns out to be a brick. Or a boulder. Or a concrete mixer, maybe.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s my rock-solid little girl!&quot; Derpy grinned, ruffling Dinky&#039;s mane. &quot;You can always rely on her to be strong!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Why couldn&#039;t Mac or Berry Punch be Awake this Loop?</i> Twilight thought. <i>I need a drink NOW. Brain bleach is ineffective if applied four hours after the memory you want to erase...</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>81.1 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chiyo was new to this all &#039;looping&#039; business. She&#039;d had a few loops before, but they&#039;d all been like her normal human self, so when noticed she&#039;d had hooves this time around her first thoughts were not particularly surprising.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Chill out...&quot; Spike paused. &quot;Short Stuff.&quot; He sniggered.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not funny! I don&#039;t have hands! And I&#039;m probably late for class!&quot; Chiyo got up and tried to run for the nearest exit.</p><p class="double">She felt a strong tug on her body and was pulled back. Her body was turned around, and she was face to face with Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay. Calm down! Breathe!&quot; Said Spike encouragingly.</p><p class="double">To her surprise, she found out she was doing so.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, now what&#039;s the last thing you remember?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was boarding a plane to America. Oh! This must be the start of a new loop! But I don&#039;t recognize anypony. Wait, did I just say &#039;Anypony&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anypony is fine here. This is probably your first fused loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now try to think back to what your memories are telling you. Your other memories.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, I was reading about the Mare in the Moon. She was going to return on the Longest Day after 1000 years! That&#039;s tomorrow! I&#039;ve got tell somepony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Calm. Breathe.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo sucked in a huge breath and let it out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! I can tell Princess Celestia! She&#039;ll probably know what to do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay! You&#039;re doing great! I can take down a letter and send it to the Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After sending the letter a short period passed and Spike belched again. He unfurled the scroll and read out loud.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Short Stuff,</p><p class="double">I&#039;m glad you&#039;re paying attention to your studies, but you must simply stop reading those dusty old books. There is more to a young filly&#039;s life than studying. So I&#039;m sending you to oversee the preparations for this year&#039;s Summer Sun Celebration, Ponyville. And I&#039;ve got a more essential task for you to complete; make some friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">At seeing Chiyo&#039;s downcast face, Spike spoke up. &quot;That&#039;s pretty normal. Don&#039;t worry about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So we&#039;re off to Ponyville?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re off to Ponyville.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.2 (yannoshka)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Major Tiana Ramboux of Commonwealth Marine Crusaders surveyed her team, with pursed lips.</p><p class="double">They were earth&#039;s best and brightest. The CMC alpha team sent into the hardest missions to protect mankind from extrasolar threats. And they were so good as to have 0 mortality rate where even the second best team suffered 30% casualties per mission.</p><p class="double">And they were also the textbook ur-example of ragtag bunch of misfits.</p><p class="double">The Algerian massaged her aching temples as she tried to cope with the fact that her second in command and her pilot were in the process of beating the stuffing out of each other. Again.</p><p class="double">It said much for their group dynamics that the other three members of the team were paying no attention to the rumpus.</p><p class="double">&quot;Another ship maintenance argument?&quot; she tiredly asked lieutenant Bell.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know it Diamond. Apple was harping again on the unnecessary amount of work Scooter&#039;s grandstanding maneuvers out of combat create. You know Scooter - fighter jock to the bone, so she responded with her usual in-your-face brash idiocy.&quot; The classy Englishwoman shrugged in dismissal.</p><p class="double">&quot;After the bruises I got last time I tried to get between the two of them, I&#039;m staying well clear of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you two?&quot; Major turned her gimlet glare which earned her her nickname to the other two.</p><p class="double">Xenia Nidalli and Bianca Salvatore y Cuchara de la Plata, were team&#039;s assault specialists and more than strong and skilled enough to separate the brawling pair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Esas dos están completamente locas, Mayor.&quot; The improbably white haired latina answered, her eyes rolling in exasperation behind her glasses and her Nigerian counterpart hurried to add on.</p><p class="double">&quot;If it looked like they were going to do serious harm to each other, we&#039;d have stepped in Diamond you know that. So we figured to let them get it out of their system in controlled environments.&quot;</p><p class="double">And then, as one, all six of them awoke to the loop.</p><p class="double">A short time and two quick application of nanoheal later the six loopers were joined in conference by the three Founder&#039;s ghosts.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, to recap, we are in human loop that centers around Solar system defense from alien invaders with lots of planetside combat, and the six of you represent an elite multinational strike team. The best one there is apparently&quot; Cookie mused bemusedly.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what are our options?&quot; Clover cut in on her compatriot&#039;s musings.</p><p class="double">“To determine that, I think we need more information. As I see it there are three main questions here. Who are we fighting? What resources do we have to fight with, and how do they scale with our foe&#039;s? How much are we dedicated to playing out this loop?” As per norm, Pensee took the lead when matters turned toward strategy. Even Diamond Tiara bowed downed to the founders acumen in that area.</p><p class="double">“As far as aliens are concerned, they are a celluloitic lifeform...” Sweetie Belle began answering...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Admiral Antoan Luis Péricarde, better known to the multiverse at large as Jean Luc Picard, was not enjoying the loop overmuch. The stress induced by keeping a low profile while being a prominent public figure was considerable and the <i>maudite barbe</i> itched like the blazes. And to top it all of he had a mission of utmost importance for the safety of this loop&#039;s solar system, which further meant he had to contact his only team that had any hope whatsoever to pull it of. That in and by itself shouldn&#039;t have been so bad, except that the asinine command structure demanded that he do so personally, and he was prepared to bet NCC-1701-D that sooner or later, if they haven&#039;t already, that that bunch will turn out to be loopers.</p><p class="double">He reviewed their files once more, as if they would be able to tell him if the people in question were Awake or not.</p><p class="double">Major Tiana Ramboux, call-sign Diamond, was a former high priced corporate soldier for hire who enlisted as soon as the reality of extraterrestrial threat was made certain. She quickly distinguished herself both as a soldier and as a leader. Her disciplinary records were not so clean, stemming mostly from her lack of patience with fools and bureaucratic oversight.</p><p class="double">Captain Alexandra &#039;Apple&#039; Blum was an oddity. One would think degrees in mechanical, aeronautical and electronics engineering out of MiT would lead her to the R&#039;n&#039;D, but so far all and every attempt to reassign her so resulted in her offering to resign, and an unspoken but certain promise that with her out, so would be the financial and material support of the Smith-Blum consortium. She was after all the younger sister of consortium&#039;s current CEO.</p><p class="double">Lieutenant Brianna Bell was another odd duck in her own way. How many officers in any armed forces could add &#039;operatically trained&#039; to their resume, after all. A daughter of SAS colonel she practically grew up with a gun in her hand, and even won Cambridge where she was getting her bio-sciences degree several gold medals on the marksmanship team.</p><p class="double">Then there was sargent Xenia Nidalli. She at least was fairly normal. Barer of several medals for courage and valor for endangering herself to pull wounded allies from the line of fire.</p><p class="double">Sargent Bianca Salvatore y Cuchara de la Plata, was also fairly normal, save for the fact that she was heiress to large estates in her native Argentina.</p><p class="double">And then, there was the <i>piece d&#039;</i>. The authentic, real deal, ge-nu-i-ne maverick. Song &#039;Scooter&#039; Loo. The Chinese girl was five feet three package of bad attitude, blind arrogance and the very worst of fighter jock stereotype. She was drummed out of ROCAF, and would have been out of CMC save for the fact she was a prodigy at the controls of any kind of flying craft. And Admiral was darkly certain, not even that would have saved her career if she had not fallen into the able clutches of Major Ramboux.</p><p class="double">He sighed dejectedly, then pulled his face into the ebullient mask of his in-loop persona and keyed in a communication request to CMC vessel “Bad Seed”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Having decided to stick out with the loop for the moment, crusaders and the founders were in the middle of hashing out the finer details on their plans when the emergency com signal alarm bleared.</p><p class="double">“Well girls, looks like we&#039;re going to get our marching orders” DT grinned toothily at her friends as she remotely accepted the vid-con.</p><p class="double">The wall mounted screen blossomed into the magnificently bearded visage of the Commonwealth Marine Crusaders Commandant.</p><p class="double">“What new fires can we put out for you for you Admiral?” Frankly DT was appalled by how irreverent she was acting, but she was supposed to be a former merc with no respect for desk-jockeys and it wouldn&#039;t do to break her role at that point.</p><p class="double">&quot;Si votre bande d&#039;abrutis insubordonnés n&#039;étiez pas aussi utiles...” Despite his clear ire, admiral&#039;s words were almost conversational.</p><p class="double">“Oui, oui, mon admiral! Je m&#039;excuse. You have a mission for us, oui?”</p><p class="double">“We have discovered what is believed to be lichen&#039;s premier listening post on the surface of Proteus. I don&#039;t have to teach you your job. Take ton bande de joyeux tarés and do it. The rest of information is in the briefing we have just uploaded to “Bad Seed”. Time is of the essence. Au revoire Major!”</p><p class="double">“Ya know gals, Admiral looked mighty familiar to me...”</p><p class="double">“Sure he did Bloom, sure, he did...” DT dismissed Apple Blooms concerns offhandedly as she puzzled over the briefing.</p><p class="double">&quot;No Ah&#039;m telling you, I&#039;m certain we&#039;ve encountered him outside this loop...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well I&#039;m certain I don&#039;t recognize him, and I perform mental strengthening and organization exercises twice a day...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.3 (barryc100588)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac&#039;s Bar was open for business and full of loopers, including a certain purple dragon, and he was telling a story about one of his adventures to the audience. the Crusaders were especially captivated.</p><p class="double">&quot;I had just entered the third area of the Forgotten Worlds, Evening Lake, and I decide to go look and see if there was anyone captive here, too. I figured the Sorceress would do that, if Sergeant Bird and Sheila the Kangaroo were anything to go on. And sure enough, in the central tower of the area, I found a yeti in a cage, with my old &quot;friend&quot; Moneybags the Bear &quot;guarding&quot; him.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom chose this moment to interrupt. &quot;It&#039;s incredible how, how...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Duplicitous!&quot; Sweetie piped up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, what does <i>that</i> mean, Sweetie?&quot; Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It means to be deceptive or double-dealing. In this case, Moneybags agreed to keep the animals the Sorceress captured locked up, but also agreed to free those same animals if paid.&quot; Sweetie explained.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo coughed what sounded like &quot;dictionary&quot; under her breath.</p><p class="double">Spyro chuckled. &quot;he is duplicitous, Apple Bloom. Now back to my story. I paid him 1000 gems to free Bently, and after calling him, an, and I quote, &#039;avoricious, duplicitous, larcenous ursine&#039;, he clubbed Moneybags with his club before knocking him away and inviting me into his world.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. &quot;He sounds pretty violent.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow chose then to speak up. &quot;I don&#039;t know about you, Twilight, but if I was locked up by someone for money, and that same person freed me for money, I&#039;d get pretty violent too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Other loopers in the room were nodding in agreement.</p><p class="double">Spyro nodded. &quot;Each of the captive animals were violent to Moneybags, if you recall.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.1 continued (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was one of the odd loops for Osaka so far, not that she particularly minded. She got to bake these wonderful Okinawan doughnuts called sata andagi. Also, she was a unicorn, and currently holding one of said doughnuts in her telekinetic grip. She was standing in the middle of Ponyville&#039;s main street, as her loop memories were suggesting she should wait here.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh right. Kyon said I didn&#039;t have to do that anymore.&quot; She was just about to turn and leave when she heard a flapping. In the distance an ivory and gold chariot arrived, stopping a little distance from her. Its two passengers disembarked a small dragon and an orange unicorn foal with a star pattern on her flank. She trotted up to the two.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Chiyo,&quot; She wasn&#039;t sure it was Chiyo, but the pattern fit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Osaka!&quot; Her eyes lit up, and she tackled Osaka in a hug.</p><p class="double">&quot;I take it you two know each other?&quot; asked Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! I almost forgot; this is Spike. He&#039;s one of the loopers native to Equestria. He&#039;s been a big help!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike beamed a little at that, polishing a claw off his chest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you seen any of our other friends?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well..&quot; She was interrupted by the sounds of a whistle being blown.</p><p class="double">&quot;Halt! Freeze! Stop in the name of the law!&quot; A brown earth pony with black hair ran up to the trio.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve never you two before, and I know everypony in Ponyville.&quot; said the newcomer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tomo! It&#039;s me Chiyo! And you recognize Osaka!&quot; her eyes darting from Tomo to Osaka.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! It&#039;s the same madness Deep Fried&#039;s got! Is it contagious? I&#039;ve got to get the hazmat suits! Wait, what if I&#039;m already infected!&quot; Tomo started running around chasing her tail, until she was stopped by another earth pony, who bopped her over the head. She was a yellow earth pony wearing a pink cheongsam dress. She bowed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I really must apologize for my friend here. I&#039;m Curry Noodle, and this is Fair Cop. She can be a very silly pony at times.&quot; Her last sentence said in a serious tone as she faced Tomo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! I&#039;m Short Stuff; this is Spike, and this is...&quot; bowing and then nodding to Osaka.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot; said Spike, and giving a little bow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Deep Fried. Pleased to meet you.&quot; said Osaka, also bowing.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve met. We&#039;ve lived in Ponyville for how many years?&quot; Yomi deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh right.&quot; said Osaka sheepishly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we&#039;ll let you get on with your business.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hold on!&quot; said Spike fumbling with a clipboard in his hands. &quot;We&#039;re representatives of Princess Celestia. We&#039;re overseeing the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration.&quot; </p><p class="double">He examined the clipboard. &quot;You said your names were Fair Cop and Curry Noodle? Fair Cop is handling security? And you and Deep Fried are handling catering?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; yelled Tomo.</p><p class="double">Osaka and Yomi both just nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, let&#039;s see what you have in mind.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.4 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh put down his flagon. It was pretty much empty. Even after all the things the loops had thrown at him, having the sun-mover herself in his bar, albeit incognito, and wanting to commiserate, made him want to go for the stronger stuff. But no, this was supposed to be a place where any person could come for help, be it alcoholic or psychologic. Making an exception for this one by sloshing himself would be catastrophically hypocritical.</p><p class="double">Easy, Macintosh. Breathe in, breathe out. Just another looper, looking for a drink. All that was different was this one moved the sun on a more regular basis than the others that came through. Although, that did raise a question.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yall&#039;ve been here before, why the get-up?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare who had introduced herself as Rose Eyes didn&#039;t respond immediately. A sigh sent her purple-and-white mane rippling.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember when you realized who I was? You tensed up. I saw that every time I was in here, both from the new loopers, and from you. I surmised you would be more comfortable not knowing my name, and it seems I was right.”</p><p class="double">She jostled the flagon, swirling its contents around.</p><p class="double">“I really do like the mountain-cider though. Reminds me of one of Starswirl&#039;s favorites.”</p><p class="double">Macintosh didn&#039;t know how to respond to that, so he let the silence hang there for a moment.</p><p class="double">“You must forgive me if I&#039;m being too forward.”</p><p class="double">He quirked an eyebrow. Now there was a loaded sentence. She seemed to pick up on that, and clarified.</p><p class="double">“One of the best things about the loops is that my sister and I are no longer the only immortals around. Keeping from getting attached to those around them, being able to only share with a select few the burdens of the ages, while still seeing those fleeting others as people, these are things an undying ruler must accept. Loopers share a similar burden.”</p><p class="double">He humphed introspectively. He hadn&#039;t looked at it that way.</p><p class="double">“Now, even though that burden hasn&#039;t changed in its essence, there are now several dozen new ponies, liable to still be there for a while, for the both myself and Luna to get to know.“</p><p class="double">None of that corner-pinching to this smile. As genuine as smiles come.</p><p class="double">“After all this time, it&#039;s a relief to be able to spend time with ponies without worrying they&#039;ll be gone next century. I can make friends again.”</p><p class="double">Macintosh would have been fine with letting the happy silence linger a bit, but Murphy did not let it stand.</p><p class="double">The bell at the door chimed, and he looked up. What he saw there caused him to quirk an eyebrow just a tad. It was Cherilee, with a mischievous gleam in her eye.</p><p class="double">Wuh-oh.</p><p class="double">One of the deviations from baseline that had cropped up this Loop was that he and Cherilee had been dating. While not as unpleasantly committing or emotionally compromising as some relationships he&#039;d Awoken to, it had nevertheless necessitated him growing a bit of distance between the two of them. He&#039;d been gradual with it, but could sense a certain amount of cling from the schoolmarm. So, while not inherently dooming, this visit was still a minefield he&#039;d have to tread carefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Evening Mac, I&#039;ll have a Bloom&#039;s Mild to start.&quot;</p><p class="double">He retrieved the liquid and an appropriate vessel and began pouring, while the disguised princess and Cherilee nodded to each other. It was a nod of greeting, silence between strangers, not acknowledgement of a co-conspirator. Whatever mischief was afoot, he didn&#039;t think Celestia was involved.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just got back from Zecora&#039;s, and I think you&#039;re right. We should try something different.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Cherilee swiveled on the barstool and looked him in the eye. He could see something in there, a weight to those words that hadn&#039;t been there before. Another horseshoe was yet to drop.</p><p class="double">He felt the best response was raised eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;I told the witch doctor you didn&#039;t love me true.&quot;</p><p class="double">The eyebrow elevated further.</p><p class="double">&quot;I told the witch doctor you didn&#039;t love me nice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac could tell this was going somewhere, but he wasn&#039;t sure where.</p><p class="double">&quot;And then, the witch doctor, she gave me some advice.&quot;</p><p class="double">His heart skipped a beat as music started playing out of nowhere, and then started palpating in tune as he felt himself in the grips of the start of a Heartsong.</p><p class="double">&quot;I told the witch doctor I was in love with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">His muscles started twitching in time, the natural response to this magical release, but his mind was afire with speculation. Romantic Heartsongs were potent, rare magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;I told the witch doctor you didn&#039;t love me too.&quot;</p><p class="double">He&#039;d never participated one, but he&#039;d seen one set the entirety of Manehatten a-dancing like a whirlwind of charged gyrations.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know that you&#039;ll be mine when I say this to you.&quot;</p><p class="double">He began channeling the determination to resist, the fire behind his eyes stilling himself down to a rock-solid core. Stand, not Smash, was the relevant word, but the principle remained the same.</p><p class="double">It started with nonsense, but it was a directed nonsense, and he fought the rhythmic motions down again.</p><p class="double">The mantra repeated, as though to cement its hold. However, something was different. Its underpinnings seemed more silly this time than salacious.</p><p class="double">Then he recognized it, a children&#039;s tune from the Hub, and he gave her a deadpan look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Woke Up this mornin&#039;, didja?&quot;</p><p class="double">The only reply he got was a wide, toothy smile.</p><p class="double">The infectious tune continued, and even after the chorus line had burst in and carried Cherilee off accompanied by boppy, poppy nonsense, he found himself incapable of forming an appropriate response. Until, that is, his drinking partner burst out laughing. She probably recognized the song. Then the absurdity of the situation hit him, and he joined in the merriment, their peals of mirth echoing in the rafters and filling the empty cellar.</p><p class="double">Just two friends, sharing a moment. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.5 (barryc100588)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Spike, and Twilight were walking through Twinkle Park, Spike and Twilight admiring the attractions. Twilight was also confused about the perpetual night in this area. They were all Awake, and had already sorted their Loop memories.</p><p class="double">&quot;Say, Sonic. If this area has perpetual night, how does it stay warm? Everything should have frozen by now.&quot; Twilight said, confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not actually perpetual night. It&#039;s simply that the park is only open at night.&quot; Sonic explained with a smile.</p><p class="double">Spike chose this moment to speak up. &quot;Can we see the fun house mirror ride?&quot; He asked, eager.</p><p class="double">Knuckles frowned. &quot;What&#039;s so special about a set of strange mirrors?&quot; He asked, irritated. &quot;We&#039;re supposed to be looking for Chaos Emeralds and Master Emerald shards.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, but I&#039;ve never been to this amusement park before, and I want to check out everything.&quot; Spike said.</p><p class="double">Sonic chuckled. He&#039;d never been to Twinkle Park before now, either. It had always been Amy who ended up here, and he only got here with Tails and Knuckles because Twilight teleported them all past the front gate. &quot;Sure, Spike. Let&#039;s go to the fun house.&quot; With that, he took off. Since he didn&#039;t actually know where the fun house was, he went in a random direction. The others hurried to keep up with him, Twilight scooping Spike onto her back. They eventually managed to reach the fun house and walked inside. Spike climbed off Twilight and approached one of the mirrors. What he saw shocked him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, Twilight? This mirror is showing something strange. When I look in, I see myself as my Gen 1 persona.&quot; Spike said as Twilight approached. After Twilight got beside Spike, her eyes widened. &quot;Is that.. my mother?&quot; She asked. &quot;What&#039;s my mother doing on the other side of the mirror?&quot;</p><p class="double">Tails approached and looked up at the top of the mirror. &quot;Interdimensional mirror.&quot; He frowned in thought. &quot;This mirror must show how you look in a different dimension. Based on what Spike said, I bet your looking at your Generation 1 selves. If Sonic were to look in the mirror, I bet he&#039;d see his Classic self, or how he looked in one of his cartoons or comics.&quot; Tails explained. He got closer, but instead of showing his younger self, the Tails in the mirror was a bit taller, with better gloves and a belt around his waist, that held a couple tools. &quot;Wait a minute. That&#039;s not my younger self. Who is that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sonic heard Tails and went to investigate. &quot;What&#039;s wrong, buddy?&quot;</p><p class="double">Tails turned around. &quot;Sonic! Could you look in this mirror and tell me what you see?&quot; the fox asked.</p><p class="double">Sonic nodded with a smile. &quot;Sure, buddy.&quot; The others stepped aside so Sonic could see better. Knuckles joined him. The reflections they saw shocked them both. Sonic was also a bit taller. His shoes were different and he had athletic tape on his arms and legs. As for Knuckles, his chest was more bulky, with longer arms and he also had athletic tape on him. &quot;What.. are we looking at?&quot; Sonic asked. &quot;I&#039;ve been to the Hub before, but I&#039;ve never seen anything like this version of me.&quot; Knuckles nodded, dumbfounded as he backed away from the mirror.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think we should leave. I don&#039;t think there are any Master Emerald shards or Chaos Emeralds here.&quot; the echidna said. The others nodded and headed for the exit, Twilight and Spike frowning.</p><p class="double">&quot;That was strange.&quot; Twilight muttered. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.6 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There were consequences, Twilight supposed, to a world where Discord in ancient days overthrew the tyrannical mad rule of the Evil Alicorn Sisters.</p><p class="double">This wasn&#039;t her first Loop in such an alternate reality. The one thing all such loops had in common was that the rules of magic she&#039;d grown up with were changed- that is to say, there weren&#039;t any. Cause and effect weren&#039;t so much linked as held together by kite string and bubble gum. Beyond that one thing, however, no holds were barred. Awakening to Loop memories of being Discord&#039;s personal student (or, more often, a leader in the pony Resistance) meant absolutely nothing about the baseline could be taken for granted.</p><p class="double">But some surprises were more so than others.</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings,&quot; Maud Pie said with all the apparent enthusiasm of a tenured history professor one semester from retirement and two semesters from embalming.* &quot;And welcome to Ditzyland, where you shall see wonders the likes of which you have never experienced in all your lives.&quot;</p><p class="double">The placid petrophile pony led the group into the park, past such excitement-filled rides like Cross-Country Bus Trip to Seaddle, the Tree Climb, and the Stairs That Don&#039;t Go Anywhere Except Upstairs. There were carnival games, such as The Ball Goes Down the Hole Not Up It and Spray Water At the Clown Not Vice Versa. For educational purposes there was the Hall of Rather Boring But Important Laws, where ancient pony rulers completely failed to move and talk to a recorded soundtrack. There was a small petting zoo where the cats did not eat cheeseburgers and the owls did not make snarky commentary on the pony condition.</p><p class="double">And at the center of the park, just in front of Ditzy&#039;s Cloud Castle of Dreams That Stay Dreams, was Maud&#039;s rock farm.</p><p class="double">&quot;Behold the limestone aggregate,&quot; Maud said. “Each of these dozens of pebbles within the stone is of an entirely different mineral, washed down from ancient mountains by floods, deposited on ancient sea beds, then glued together over uncounted centuries by dissolved limestone deposits into this new rock.&quot;</p><p class="double">One pony waved a hoof. &quot;What does it do when you rub one of the little pebbles?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing,&quot; Maud replied. &quot;It&#039;s a rock.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd oohed in appreciation and stared even harder at the funny-looking rock which, despite all expectations to the contrary and millenia of good reasons to expect otherwise, just lay there.</p><p class="double">As Twilight browsed the gift shop full of Hats For Only Your Head and Food-Flavored Muffins, she had to admit this was a first for her. Never before, in more Loops than she could count, had she ever visited an actual, honest-to-goodness bemusement park.</p><p class="double"></p><p>* Two semesters before embalming or after, it doesn&#039;t matter.

You&#039;re not crazy or sick!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s a shocker.&quot; Yomi deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, now Curry. Please give me some credit. I am a detective after all. I detect things and place them together into ways that make sense.&quot; Tomo stood on her hind legs and mimed combining two invisible objects.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very good. And what have you detected?&quot; Yomi continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;That our Ms. Deep Fried here has been hanging out with Lyra Heartstrings lately. This must be some new fad. &#039;Osaka&#039; is probably a &#039;human&#039; name.&quot; She made air-quotes with her hooves after saying, &quot;Osaka&quot; and &quot;human&quot;.</p><p class="double">&quot;And Short Stuff here?&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;She probably picked it up from Deep Fried here. You know how impressionable fillies are at her age. I&#039;m right..aren&#039;t I&quot; She looked at Chiyo expectantly.</p><p class="double">Somepony more observant than Tomo would&#039;ve have noticed a bead of sweat form on Chiyo&#039;s face, and everypony else&#039;s, for that matter. What surprised all of them was what Chiyo said next.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right..you&#039;re completely right. Would all of you like human names? It is the latest fad.&quot; </p><p class="double">Tomo seemed to ponder it over for a bit, but Yomi agreed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, that sounds like fun. What would you call me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo smiled. &quot;How about Yomi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I like it. All right, my human name is Yomi.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! She asked me first! What&#039;s my human name?&quot; whined Tomo.</p><p class="double">&quot;How about Tomo?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah. That sounds like a terrible name. How about Chieko or maybe Mandy?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo gave Tomo a dirty look and in a serious tone said, &quot;It&#039;s Tomo.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? Why&#039;s that got to be my name..?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And just like that, before she knew it, her name was Tomo.&quot; Intoned Osaka.</p><p class="double">Yomi suddenly stopped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hey. We&#039;re here.&quot; In front of them was a building with a large sign displaying a bowl of noodles and a hoof somehow holding chopsticks.</p><p class="double">Osaka&#039;s leg shook. &quot;My Deep sense is acting up. My left leg tingling tells me we&#039;ll soon eat a delicious meal.&quot;</p><p class="double">Everypony looked at her. &quot;Well we are, aren&#039;t we?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on. Let&#039;s just go in.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight raised one hoof to wipe the sleep out of her eyes. Why had Celestia recalled her to Canterlot so soon after the restoration of Princess Luna? And why had she insisted upon having Twilight join her for the raising of the sun?</p><p class="double">Celestia opened the doors to the balcony and stepped outside, waiting for Twilight to join her. Both mares could see Luna standing on the balcony of her own tower, horn alight as she guided the moon to it rest at the close of a warm summer night. &quot;I wish to thank you again for bringing my sister back to her senses,&quot; Celestia said. &quot;But there are other dangers in the world, and it is possible I might not be able to return, should one of those dangers banish me as Nightmare Moon did. Therefore it is vital that I teach you how to raise the sun, so that Equestria need never fear eternal night again so long as you survive.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight knew perfectly well how to raise the sun, but explaining that to a non-Awake Celestia would be more trouble than it was worth. &quot;But I&#039;m just a young unicorn!&quot; she protested instead. &quot;In the old days it took a hundred unicorns to raise and lower the sun!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You have a great power within you, Twilight Sparkle,&quot; Celestia said. &quot;And there is a secret to the raising that the ancient unicorns did not possess, a secret that makes the spell much easier. Watch and listen carefully. The incantation is particularly important.&quot;</p><p class="double">The last edge of the moon slid below the horizon, and Canterlot was lit only in starlight.</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s horn glowed. She lowered her horn, spread her wings dramatically, and spoke her incantation:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Rise, darn you.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">The sun snapped over the horizon with a motion that, had it possessed sound, would have been a most comical boing-oing-oing.</p><p class="double">Satisfied, Celestia folded her wings and turned to face a slack-jawed Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;What... what.... what??&quot; Twilight tried, and failed, to keep her stare respectful. &quot;That&#039;s IT? &#039;Rise, darn you&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, Twilight,&quot; Celestia said, unable to keep a small smile off her face and the giggle from her voice, &quot;haven&#039;t you heard the saying? <i>It is always darkest before the darn!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes narrowed. &quot;You&#039;ve been Awake all this time, haven&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just so you could pull that lame joke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, mostly that,&quot; Celestia nodded. Her horn flared again, and a large pair of Hawaiian jams with a color clash so severe as to risk blindness floated out of her wardrobe. &quot;But also there&#039;s some sunspots due in a week, and that means solar prominences just crying out to be surfed.&quot; Celestia walked off the balcony, adding, &quot;Thanks in advance for covering for me while I&#039;m hanging two!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight only stopped grinding her teeth when she remembered just how unpleasant her last visit to an Equestrian dentist had been... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.8 (WyldeHorse)</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, as usual, yet again reading about the return of Nightmare Moon - yet another baseline loop, from the look of things.</p><p class="double">Idly, she flipped through the rest of the book to make sure there wouldn&#039;t be any... surprises. That happened sometimes, but they were usually hinted at in the book.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, as she turned the last page, a voice seemed to fill the room. <b>&quot;I know my ABCs! Congratulations, you have read 1 book!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">She thumped her head against the table. It seemed like this would be one of the odder loops...</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>I got a booboo!

Did you need something?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her mouth worked uselessly for a moment before she shook her head. &quot;Has my brother sent me an invitation to his wedding yet?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mailmare checked her list, and not finding it, dug around in her bag for several seconds. &quot;Doesn&#039;t look like it, sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s alright. It&#039;ll get here when it gets here.&quot; And with that, she got out of there. <i>Fast</i>. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.9 (namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why was pinkie pie an actual magical, moving, talking pie this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just don&#039;t know what went on.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Say Ditzy, Just what <i>does</i> your cutie mark mean anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy glanced up from her delivery list, &quot;Huh? You really want to know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You promise you won&#039;t tell?&quot; The pegasus pleaded, glancing around. &quot;No one asks, and no one knows... and it&#039;s a secret to everypony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I promise...&quot; Twilight said with a touch of hesitance.</p><p class="double">With a nod, the mailmare dug in her sack for a moment, producing... a hat. A detective&#039;s hat, to be precise. Along with a monocle, tweed overcoat and a little smoking pipe that she put in her mouth, which began to produce bubbles. &quot;I deduce that you are surprised.&quot; She stated. &quot;To be expected, of course. No one suspects that the clumsy mailmare is secretly Sherlock Derp, the world&#039;s greatest detective.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, her mouth agape and her head tilted at an odd angle, could only ask &quot;Why...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did I inform you of my identity? Simple, my dear librarian. I made a bet with Sparkler, and promised to tell the first pony to ask.&quot; She blew into her pipe again, making more bubbles. &quot;She owes me five days doing my scheduled chores, by the way. She bet it would be Pinkie to ask.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.10 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was early in a rather sparse baseline Loop, and Twilight just happened to be on the edge of town, near the road that a certain, currently un-Awake showmare would be taking to get into Ponyville. The &quot;gushing fanfilly&quot; method of convincing Trixie to work with her audience rather than against it worked nine times out of ten, and it was fun to boot.</p><p class="double">The Anchor heard the unmistakable sound of hooves and wheels approaching, imagined she was about to meet a combination of A. K. Yearling and Celestia (which had sadly only happened once,) and slipped out of her hiding place with a Pinkie-grade smile on her face, ready to give a gasp to match.</p><p class="double">Twilight stopped in her tracks, gasp forgotten. Before her was a unicorn mare, yes. Her coat was about the right shade of blue. But there the similarities ended. This one had foregone Trixie&#039;s hat and cape. She had a blonde ponytail (and blonde pony tail) much like Applejack&#039;s. Her expression was the familiar look of baffled resignation that went with a first Loop in Equestria.</p><p class="double">Oh, and the wagon was painted a shade of orange usually reserved for citrus fruit and safety cones.</p><p class="double">&quot;I take it you were expecting some… pony else.&quot;</p><p class="double">The sentence shook Twilight out of her surprise. She cleared her throat and approached the stranger. &quot;I was. We get a traveling showmare around this time of year, but you&#039;re a new face.&quot; She smiled. Pinkie wasn&#039;t Awake, so she&#039;d have to roll out the welcome wagon. &quot;You seem like a ship adrift. Would you like an Anchor?&quot;</p><p class="double">The other mare&#039;s lips curved a bit upward. &quot;Thought I had one. Still, it&#039;d be nice.&quot; A beat. &quot;Um, could you help me unhitch myself? Feels like I Woke up harnessed.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Inside the wagon, which was rather better organized than normal, the two unicorns enjoyed a cup of tea. &quot;I take it you&#039;re normally human?&quot; asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mostly,&quot; answered the mare whose Loop memories named her &quot;the Amazing Bombshell.&quot; &quot;Got a few exotic bits of DNA in there. Long story.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What can you tell me about your home Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Science fiction, according to most. Usually I&#039;m a bounty hunter. Go to exotic places, meet interesting people, fire lasers at them.&quot; Bombshell shrugged. &quot;It&#039;s a living.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pieces came together in Twilight&#039;s mind. &quot;Well, that explains your cutie mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My what?&quot; Bombshell looked at her hips, seeing the all too familiar image of a planet mid-explosion. She facehoofed. &quot;Oh, come on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled a bit. &quot;The mare you&#039;re replacing would approve, I&#039;m sure.&quot; She extended a forehoof. &quot;Welcome to Equestria, Miss Aran.&quot;</p><p class="double">Samus smiled and returned the hoofbump. &quot;Thanks. I&#039;ve met a few locals in the Smash Brothers Loop, so I wasn&#039;t caught completely off-guard. Still, whatever I was expecting, this wasn&#039;t it.&quot; She waved a hoof at the various props and pyrotechnics. &quot;I&#039;m not usually one to bring undue attention to myself.&quot; She snorted. &quot;Still, that&#039;s the Loops for you. I once replaced Naruto. I think it was the orange.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight snickered. Loop humor. Hilarious in hindsight, or when it didn&#039;t happen to you. &quot;Well, nopony said you had to follow the script exactly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You sound like you have something in mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think so.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A few hours later, the very orange wagon came to a stop in the town square. Onlookers approached, mumbling curiously. The stage unfolded, and Bombshell walked out from behind the curtain, eyes closed. She sat and magic that matched the wagon in hue enveloped her horn.</p><p class="double">For a moment, nothing seemed to happen. Then a low hum came in on the edge of hearing. The hum rose in pitch as the light around Bombshell&#039;s horn grew in intensity. Another layer formed, then another. Her eyes opened, glowing from within. An orange aura enveloped the stage and the whole thing rose into the air.</p><p class="double">The crowd murmured as the wagon did a circuit about the square. They gasped as it started rolling in the air. They cheered at the loop-de-loop. They boggled when Bombshell buzzed Town Hall. As the stage came to a landing where it had taken off, their stomping applause was like a small earthquake.</p><p class="double">Bombshell smiled. A few pieces of Chozo technology translated well to unicorn magic, but none better than the Charge Beam. She rose and held up a forehoof for silence. It took the better part of a minute, but she got it. Her voice projected clearly and calmly, with no indication of her exertion. &quot;Hello. You may have heard of &#039;the Amazing Bombshell,&#039; but I&#039;m not that great.&quot; She waited for the protests to die down. &quot;I just know a few tricks, that&#039;s all. While I&#039;m in town, any unicorns in the audience who want to expand their repertoire are welcome to pay me a visit. I&#039;d especially like to help any older foals learn to develop their abilities. Everypony else, I&#039;m sorry, but I just don&#039;t know enough about your magic to offer much beyond some meditation techniques.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her smile widened. &quot;But who knows? This place is so nice, I might just stay for longer than I planned. Might even learn something about earth ponies and pegasi.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bombshell walked to the front of the stage and squatted. The front of the audience opened up, and she hopped down to their level. She looked around. &quot;So, anypony interested?&quot;</p><p class="double">An eager crowd closing in, a wall to her back. If it weren&#039;t for the smiles and the sunshine, she could&#039;ve been back on Dark Aether.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie beamed at the message plastered across the visor of her ocean-blue Power Suit. Killing was never fun, even when it was killing unrepentant alien monsters who&#039;d killed her in-Loop parents and were bent on using energy parasites as galaxy-conquering weapons. But this? This made it all worth it.</p><p class="double">TIME BOMB SET</p><p class="double">GET OUT FAST!</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Best Loop ever!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">81.11</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, no known Anchor around,” Trixie said, chewing on a stick of carrot. “At least it looks that way.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis smiled, and tapped an elegant finger against her upper lip. “Don&#039;t be so sure... but be vewwy quiet...I&#039;m hunting looper.”</p><p class="double">Trixie giggled, and picked up the restaurant menu. “Well, we&#039;ve had our starter. What do you want for a main course?”</p><p class="double">“I was thinking... something with chicken, for me,” Chrysalis decided. “And you&#039;re having that risotto. My treat.”</p><p class="double">The younger woman&#039;s eyes widened. “They do that here? I love that!”</p><p class="double">“Which is why you&#039;re having it, Trix.” Chrysalis winked. “Call it my second course.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “Fair enough. Now, which spoon should I use?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a <i>fork.</i> The one on the left. Of course. I&#039;ve told you three times already.”</p><p class="double">With a small nod, Trixie accepted the information. <i>So, behind us to the left... and three tables away.</p><p class="double"></i>“So, what&#039;s for dessert?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll tell you when it&#039;s time,” Chrysalis said, smirking.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jean-Luc Picard was enjoying himself, for once.</p><p class="double">When he wasn&#039;t in Starfleet, and especially in worlds like this one where Starfleet didn&#039;t exist, he could enjoy himself. Relax.</p><p class="double">And, of course, have a truly superlative meal.</p><p class="double">Halfway through the fish course, however, voices disturbed him.</p><p class="double">“Look, I&#039;m telling you, there&#039;s three of them.”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s clearly five, Trix. Look, we&#039;ll ask this guy. Hey, excuse me, mister?”</p><p class="double">Picard looked up. Two women – one of them tall with unusual greenish-black hair and a shimmering emerald dress, the other with a more sparkling purple outfit and dyed blue hair – were standing on the other side of his table, both looking a bit annoyed.</p><p class="double">“Can I help you?” he asked, glancing back down at the fish. It was really rather good.</p><p class="double">Besides, something was worrying him here...</p><p class="double">“Well, see,” the blue-haired one began, “Chryssy and I were arguing over how many lights there are at the bar. There&#039;s clearly three of them, see?” She pointed.</p><p class="double">Picard followed her pointing finger.</p><p class="double">“Look, you&#039;re delusional, Trix,” the other one said. “There&#039;s five, right, mister?”</p><p class="double">The blue-head – this &#039;Trix&#039; – shook her head. “Look, she&#039;s going to be going on about this all evening if you don&#039;t help me out here. Just say there&#039;s three and we&#039;ll be fine.”</p><p class="double">“Stop encouraging him to lie to me!” &#039;Chryssy&#039; admonished. “There&#039;s five, right?”</p><p class="double">“Three!”</p><p class="double">“Five!”</p><p class="double">“There are <i>four</i> lights!” Picard roared.</p><p class="double">The women exchanged glances. Then smirked.</p><p class="double">“...oh, bugger,” he added, sinking back into his chair.</p><p class="double">“Nice to meet you, Jean-Luc Picard,” Chryssy said, extending an elegant hand. “My name is Chrysalis, and this is Trixie Lulamoon. We&#039;re from Equestria. And I suspect we just won Sleipnir Lokison an awful lot of money.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You utter, utter, jammy bastard,” Hel grumbled.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir started dancing. With eight hooves, it was quite loud.</p><p class="double">“Are telempaths cheating?” Fenris asked.</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Loki replied, smirking. “And I know he&#039;s a bastard, but the alternative is that your stepfather is a horse, Hel.”</p><p class="double">Fenris, Jormugandr and Hel winced.</p><p class="double">Behind them, Sleipnir started doing a modified version of a <i>Prisyadka.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Okay, fine, you&#039;re right.” Picard sighed, looking back down at his cooling fish dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Just don&#039;t tell the time travel department at Starfleet, or I&#039;ll never hear the start of it. Accidentally breaking the temporal prime directive...”</p><p class="double">“No problem,” Trixie said easily. “Just... hey, use fused loops to relax, right?

Since she was (for once) a pony – though, somewhat irritatingly, a <i>bat</i> pony – it was obvious who Zecora was speaking to.</p><p class="double">Well, more obvious than normal.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hi, Zecora.” Silver waved, flaring her wings and flapping up to bring their heads to the same height. “Do you have to do the rhyming thing all the time?”</p><p class="double">Zecora considered that. Then cleared her throat. “Sliver Spoon, of course I do. How else can my words ring true?”</p><p class="double">“Well... okay, then.” Silver replied, and shrugged. “No matter. What was it you wanted?”</p><p class="double">“I can brew and stew potions a plenty, but I fear my skills could atrophy.

Hang on, I&#039;ll make us a work room.”</p><p class="double">Silver clapped her hooves together, and then on the ground. With a creaking, rumbling <i>craaaaash</i>, three huge stone slabs heaved out of the Everfree soil forming three sides of a square. The one furthest away from the zebra and the thestral extended twice as high, then bent down into a roof.</p><p class="double">Not to be outdone, Zecora gestured, and wood sprouted from the ground into an instant &#039;fourth wall&#039;, complete with windows and a door.</p><p class="double">“Huh, yeah, that&#039;s pretty neat. Does it involve visualization?”</p><p class="double">“Yes. Wood is just Earth and Water combined, but first I must shape it in my Eye of Mind.”</p><p class="double">“Cool.” Silver nodded. “That&#039;ll help.” She entered the workroom, Zecora following closely behind. “Okay, first things first. Have you heard of equivalent exchange?”</p><p class="double">“One thing for another in equivalent amount is a core aspect of how nature keeps count.”</p><p class="double">“Another good start. But it&#039;s kind of more... literal, with Alkahestry or Alchemy that I know. Now, an alchemical formula is basically like a very complex equation. Let&#039;s see...”</p><p class="double">Silver flipped a pen from her Pocket, frowned, formed a table, and began drawing on it. “The circle is pretty much defining where the equation begins or ends. This symbol represents oxygen, this one represents hydrogen, and this one&#039;s water. When this is completed and run, it decomposes the right hand side of the equation into the left hand side, and this component – here?” She pointed, and Zecora nodded thoughtfully. “That&#039;s an intent link, which directs where you want to form the excess hydrogen and oxygen. &#039;s kind of like a catalyst – it makes it easier for this to happen than for it to stay the usual formula. And it costs energy, which comes from whoever&#039;s using the circle.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s like you made a cup to scoop some water up.”</p><p class="double">“Sort of, for this one at least. Or maybe if you had water in a plastic sheet, this would be like lifting one end of the sheet up so the water makes a new shape. The lifting is the effort.” Silver made a few minor annotations, then powered the circle up. “Okay, so there&#039;s water decomposing into hydrogen and oxygen just outside. Now, as we both know, that means...”</p><p class="double">She scraped a match along the floor, and threw it outside. There was a <i>BANG.</p><p class="double"></i>“That.”</p><p class="double">Zecora applauded.</p><p class="double">“Thanks, heh.” Silver scratched the back of her head, and adjusted her glasses. “Now, I tend to do it by chemistry, but there&#039;s several ways to do a transmutation. You can use the Four Classical Elements – you know, earth and air and fire and water – you can use the Five Elements instead – which breaks earth into metal and wood... basically, any system which has a categorized approach to reality. And within that categorized approach, you can&#039;t fundamentally alter which of the categories are involved.”</p><p class="double">“I believe I now begin to understand. Please restate the how so I can comprehend.”</p><p class="double">Silver pointed to the circle. “Right. So, this one uses chemistry. I can change how the atoms are arranged, but I can&#039;t make them out of nowhere, and making one kind into another involves a huge amount of effort.”</p><p class="double">Another was quickly sketched out, then powered up. “This one uses Earth, Air, Fire and Water. So I couldn&#039;t make an explosion with this one, because that would be getting fire from no-fire, but I could change a pile of soil into stone, because both of those are Earth-element even though soil is made mostly of organic matter by chemistry. That&#039;s Natural Providence. The other side of equivalent exchange is Conservation of Mass, which-”</p><p class="double">“Neither matter nor energy can occur spontaneously.”</p><p class="double">Silver nodded. “That&#039;s it exactly.” Then she picked the cup of tea up from the centre of her second circle. “Want to try some?”</p><p class="double">Zecora took it, and sipped. “Good brew. Thank you.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Now, the other side of it is the Three Principles of Transmutation. Basically, what you do with both the circle and your mind. First, Comprehension – you have to understand the structure of where you&#039;re starting from. Then Deconstruction – simplifying the original form down. And Reconstruction is to build up the new form.” Silver scribbled some equations on the wall. “All this is really pretty complicated, but I got used to it. You don&#039;t have to go down to the molecular level for everything, either... you get kinda a knack for how much you can simplify it.”</p><p class="double">Zecora examined the equations. “So I guide it along with a mental map, but what about when you simply clap?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s using my body as the circle, basically. It&#039;s... complicated. The equations and stuff are enough, usually, don&#039;t worry.”</p><p class="double">“I understand. I still have much to learn. What do you want me to do in return?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Silver kicked her hooves. “Well... I&#039;m getting pretty tired of the whole, different body shape every loop, thing. I mean, I can handle it, I&#039;m usually able to get my body working properly. But... it&#039;s just not helping, really. Everyone else is the same shape from loop to loop, and they&#039;re comfortable with it. I don&#039;t know how I&#039;m going to look... it&#039;s like puberty every five or six years.”</p><p class="double">Zecora nodded silently.</p><p class="double">“Anyway, I had this plan to use Human Transmutation – well, Pony Transmutation. It&#039;s dangerous, yeah, but there&#039;s the loops – and Edward didn&#039;t break his universe open when he did it, so...” Silver shrugged. “It&#039;s worth a try. It just takes way more power than I&#039;ve got or can handle. So... I wanted you to help me make a Philosopher&#039;s Stone.”</p><p class="double">Seeing the expression on Zecora&#039;s face, she waved her hooves. “Nothing like that! No, not using anypony else – just storing energy from <i>me.</i> Hopefully I can get enough from that to... well.”</p><p class="double">Zecora shook her head. “Silver, that is not what was confusing. I need to know which one I&#039;ll be making. I can craft ten different rocks of renown/And all of them are Philosopher&#039;s Stone.”</p><p class="double">“...oh, okay. Probably &#039;none of the above...&#039;” Silver said, frowning. “And that last line was a bit of a stretch.”</p><p class="double">The Zebra looked like she was contemplating sticking her tongue out.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.2 (Zetrein and misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie sat in front of her TV, watching yet another report of a pastry abduction. It was so sad, all those baked goods being stolen, just to force ponies to eat the horrible alien snack cakes.</p><p class="double">Then the strangest thing happened. Her TV went black, then switched to a backlit dragon wearing a dark suit. Come to think of it, he looked like an older Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, Commander.&quot; He spoke, in a deep, serious voice. Pinkie couldn&#039;t help but feel he was addressing her directly.</p><p class="double">&quot;In light of the recent extraterrestrial incursion, this Council of Princesses has convened to approve the activation of the X-Cake Project.&quot;</p><p class="double">On one hoof, Pinkie was sitting straighter, listening intently to Old-Spike-In-A-Suit. On the other, she was thinking about how the Princess could appearantly spy on ponies through their TVs.</p><p class="double">&quot;You have been chosen to lead this Initiative. To oversee our first, and last, line of defense. Your efforts will have considerable influence on this planet&#039;s baked goods. We urge you to keep that in mind as you proceed.&quot;</p><p class="double">In particular, she was thinking about all the things she had ever done while watching TV. She really hoped the Princess hadn&#039;t seen <i>that</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good luck, Commander.&quot;</p><p class="double">Right, enough embarrassed panicking, time to take back the baked goods market!</p><p class="double">&quot;We, will be watching.&quot; The screen went to black, before cutting back into the news&#039; weather forecast.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, TV-Spike! You forgot to tell me where to go!&quot; Pinkie implored her TV. Raindrops kept talking, unable to hear her as she talked about rain on thursday.</p><p class="double">Then Pinkie&#039;s doorbell rang. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Thanks to her new X-Cake introduction guide, meeting kit, and recipe book; Pinkie knew that it was up to her to gather the right ponies to help take back Equestria&#039;s baked goods from the horrible alien treats. Fortunately, she knew every pony in Ponyville.</p><p class="double">But how to choose the very best ponies was the question. She needed the elite, the ponies whose skills and special talent could mean the difference between tasty victory and bitter defeat.</p><p class="double">In the end, the pink pony party planner ended up tossing a massive amount of paper squares into the air and picking out the names that landed in her mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; Pinkie exclaimed as the last of the invited ponies entered Sugarcube Corner. She slammed the door shut and turned around to the startled ponies, &quot;The super important thing I&#039;m about to tell you will totally rock your world.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought this was an organizational party?&quot; Bon-bon questioned.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was told there&#039;d be punch,&quot; Berry Punch said.</p><p class="double">&quot;It is, and there is punch! But first, I have to tell you all what happened,&quot; Pinkie took a deep breath, &quot;Yesterday, my TV talked to me - and has possibly been spying on me in secret all along! Then, the TV dragon told me that I was chosen!&quot;</p><p class="double">All the assembled ponies looked at each other in confusion. Applejack cautiously spoke up, &quot;Pinkie Pie? Have you stopped taking your meds recently?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s silly, AJ,&quot; Pinkie snorted, &quot;I never take my meds. Of course I may have to start now that my TV made me the commander of a new super secret organization. X-Cake&#039;s mission is to fight the awful aliens that are stealing our good pastries and replacing them with horrible alien snacks. After a lengthy selection process, I have chosen all of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">The party guests looked at each other again. Pinkie just smiled and stared at them. Applejack spoke up, &quot;You&#039;ve chosen us for what, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To fight the alien menace, of course!&quot; Pinkie was interrupted by a beeping noise. She raced over to an inconspicuous cupcake on the display shelf and pushed its sprinkles in a preset pattern. Suddenly, a map of Equestria lowered from the roof. A red dot was blinking near Ponyville. Pinkie Pie gasped, &quot;Oh no! An alien UFO, an unidentified flying oreo, is approaching!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Noooo! It&#039;s after my secret muffin depot!&quot; a frantic Derpy danced in place.</p><p class="double">Pinkie pulled a candle on a nearby birthday cake and a section of the wall opened. The pink pony pointed at the new doorway, &quot;Every pony! To the candy-copters! Derpy, you man the milk mortars. Twist, put on that uniform that looks suspiciously like a red and white target. It&#039;s mission time!&quot;</p><p class="double">As Pinkie raced through the opening, the other ponies also cautiously entered; mostly due to their confusion and herd instincts. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Say Ditzy, Just what <i>does</i> your cutie mark mean anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy glanced up from her delivery list, &quot;Huh? You really want to know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mailmare leaned in conspiratorially, glancing back and forth before whispering in the unicorn&#039;s ear. &quot;...I&#039;m watching you.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the pegasus went back to her work, Twilight pondered the words. &quot;What does that even mea-&quot; She stopped when she noticed the orbs on Ditzy&#039;s flank swirl around, revealing themselves to be eyeballs of various size and eye color. The mare in question was already back to work sorting her pack and comparing its contents to her list.</p><p class="double">After a few moments of her staring contest with the eyes, Twilight muttered; &quot;Maybe I should stop asking...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.1 continued</p><p class="double">“How are you handling the strain?” Zecora asked Silver. “I do not wish to cause you pain.”</p><p class="double">“Fine, actually,” the raven replied tersely, then winced. “Okay, maybe not as fine as all that. But I can cope.”</p><p class="double">Zecora looked from her to the glowing crystal soaking up life force, then nodded. “You know your ability and limits better than me.”</p><p class="double">“Besides,” Silver added with a cawing laugh, “It&#039;s not as if it&#039;ll be <i>fatal</i> if I get it wrong...”</p><p class="double">The zebra gave her a sharp look. “This is not a joke, for you should not croak.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, guess not.” Silverbeak flapped up to her perch in their work room. (The third workroom, as it happened. One had been lost to a loop reset, the other to tree sap.</p><p class="double">Somehow.)</p><p class="double">“Since I&#039;m not going anywhere fast, let&#039;s see what you&#039;ve come up with for Alchemical circles.”</p><p class="double">Zecora indicated her approval of the idea, and brought out several sheets of paper.</p><p class="double">“These two are intended to freeze or thaw any of my brew. Heat is taken from the potion, Then moves with downward motion to a depth of two hundred feet. The temp is is determined-” she pointed, “here or here, and the array will match it to the display.”</p><p class="double">Silver crouched over, reading closely. “Yeah, looks good. What&#039;s that symbol there?”</p><p class="double">“It performs latent heat diffusion for melting or crystallization.”</p><p class="double">“Right, good. Can you show me?”</p><p class="double">Zecora rummaged in her pocket for a moment, and retrieved four potions. “Alcohol, Medicinal. Drink, fruit juice. It is apple. Potion of strength. Raises mettle. And something made using nettle.”</p><p class="double">“Medicinal alcohol?” Silver asked, blinking.</p><p class="double">“Berry Punch, she swears by such a notion, As the alcoholic healing potion.”</p><p class="double">“Unless she&#039;s had a few already, in which case she swears <i>at</i> it.” Silver giggled. “Okay, sorry, that was mean. Right, let&#039;s see this in action.”</p><p class="double">The four potions went into the circle. A hoof laid on the centre of the diagram, and they flash-froze. One of the bottles broke.</p><p class="double">“Oh my dear sweet tree of spruce...” Zecora picked it up, stuck a clean spatula into it, and licked cautiously. “Ah, I see. The frozen juice has swollen right through the top. It&#039;s an instant lollipop.”</p><p class="double">“Cool,” Silver said, then winced. “Okay, I didn&#039;t even <i>mean</i> that one.”</p><p class="double">Zecora shrugged. Then put one of the intact bottles into the other circle and activated that one.</p><p class="double">The suddenly liquid potion didn&#039;t even slosh.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d the energy come from?” Silver checked, flapping one wing experimentally and hissing quietly at the strain.</p><p class="double">“I drew it from underground,” the budding alchemist replied, “at the same depth I had found.”</p><p class="double">“Right, right. You know, it&#039;s possible to use tectonic plates as an energy source?” Zecora blinked, and Silver continued. “Yeah, it&#039;s a bit brute-force, but the forces involved with plate tectonics are so huge you really can&#039;t significantly affect them – so draw away.”</p><p class="double">“Using such a force /As a power source? That&#039;s more than we need, but would work indeed.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway, yeah, looks like you&#039;re doing fine. I&#039;m probably going to just... rest for a bit, until I get used to the drain,” Silver apologized. “Feel free to ask me for feedback, though.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is such an awesome amount of help you&#039;ve given,” Silverleaf said quietly.</p><p class="double">“Think nothing of my act, for it was my pleasure,” Zecora assured the silver squirrel. “What you taught is, in fact, Knowledge I will treasure.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, well, it&#039;s all worth it.” Silverleaf rummaged in her bushy tail, and pulled out the Philosopher&#039;s Stone. It pulsed like a coal ember with internal fire, and occasional showers of silver sparks cascaded from it.</p><p class="double">“Did you draw the circle?” Silver asked.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I have done the deed. Of drawing thrice around. It should work for your need, For thrice, no error I found.” Zecora gave her a quick look. “The choice is yours. No less, no more.”</p><p class="double">“And it&#039;s one I want to take,” Silver replied, placing the Philosopher&#039;s Stone on one anchor point of the circle. “I&#039;ve had some interesting times as... well, every kind of animal you can think of... but it&#039;s time for that to come to an end. I want to be a <i>filly</i> again. I want to know what I&#039;m going to look like in five years&#039; time.”</p><p class="double">She sighed. “I want my cutie mark back, too.”</p><p class="double">Zecora winced, then tried to smile warmly. “It&#039;s your choice today, and you have made it.” She shook her head, and composed herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will power up the array. You will need to direct it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="double">“Sure. Okay, I&#039;ve done this before... sort of...” Silver muttered, running into the other anchor point. “Here goes.”</p><p class="double">The Zebraican pressed both hooves to the circle.</p><p class="double">There was a flash of stippled silver light-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">And the clearing was empty.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.3 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Rainbow Dash, Lady of the Sky and Patron Alicorn of all things Fast, burst into the Wonderbolt training academy&#039;s cafeteria shortly before her multi-mach tailwind scattered everything light and not bolted down.</p><p class="double">&quot;OH MY GOSH!&quot; She bellowed into the room, rushing over to the wing commander. &quot;Spitfire! I&#039;ve finally found you, my long-lost lovechild!&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare gave the alicorn a deadpan stare before stating &quot;I&#039;m older than you are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; The princess rebuked, gathering the pegasus up in a tangle of limbs tentatively labelled a hug. &quot;If I&#039;d known Ricardo would take you and raise you as a speedster I would&#039;ve wanted to be there in your life!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is nonsense,&quot; Spitfire groaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;If only I&#039;d known sooner! Luckily in my digging I managed to discover the sordid history of the Wonderbolts!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh <i>no</i>.&quot; The commander whined, knowing the over-the-top princess was going to go off on a spiel of more nonsense, but not wanting to step on her royal authority trying to stop her. Sometimes being a military mare <i>sucked</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know about your affair with Applejack, Soarin! How did you enjoy her <i>pie</i>!?&quot; She pointed accusingly, not relinquishing her hold on Spits.</p><p class="double">&quot;It was actually quite good,&quot; he replied, knowing his princess&#039; tendancies toward drama and playing along with a grin. The rest of the &#039;bolts had taken on a similar stance of good-natured chuckling or smiling at their boss&#039; predicament.</p><p class="double">&quot;Put me <i>doooown</i>...&quot; Spitfire pleaded, trying her best to keep her temper and not blow up at a frickin&#039; <i>princess</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;And did you know...&quot; She paused dramatically before she pointed over to the trainees. &quot;That Snowflake and Bulk Biceps are actually <i>the same pony</i>!?&quot;</p><p class="double">The beefy pegasus himself gasped in shock.</p><p class="double">Spits had had enough. &quot;That&#039;s a secret to <i>nopony!&quot;</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sometimes it was nice being a Princess.</p><p class="double">Nopony would step in your way, they wouldn&#039;t ask you to fix what ain&#039;t broke unless you asked for it like Celestia did with her &#039;councils&#039; and &#039;nobles&#039;, and unless you went <i>really</i> off the wall, they&#039;d never bat an eye or question what you&#039;re up to.

And rightly so, since the legal document in the grip of her magic was so much gibberish with legal jargon haphazardly sprinkled throughout.</p><p class="double">&quot;A requisition for my own celestial body to govern.&quot; The rainbow princess replied. &quot;Being Princess of the Sky is nice and all, but most of it is your <i>sunny</i> sky or Luna&#039;s <i>night</i> sky and I can&#039;t help but feel like all I get are the clouds in between. You even vetoed my despotic rule over major weather systems!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To be fair...&quot; The Sun Mare said with a hesitant cringe. &quot;You <i>do</i> use words like &#039;despotic&#039; to describe it, and when allowed those powers, utilized them to cause blizzards in summer, thunderstorms on school days, caused hurricanes and thunderheads to form so you could make &#039;a cooler obstacle course&#039; and also conquered the seaponies. Let&#039;s not even get <i>started</i> on what you did under Discord&#039;s tutelage, either.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All of those were <i>incredibly awesome</i>. The seapony thing less so because they&#039;re frikkin&#039; nuts,&quot; Rainbow mused, falling back into memory before she reasserted her point. &quot;But the rest of it was <i>gold</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And don&#039;t talk about me like I&#039;m not here Celerestria,&quot; Discord sniped from where he floated above them. The princess in question indeed looking a bit more like a stringy green stalk-based timberwolf.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh stop it,&quot; The Diarch muttered, changing herself back. &quot;My point is that power and responsibility go hand in hand. A princess has duties, and you should show that you can handle what duties you have before you ask for more.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You say that like I have any duties outside babysitting Discord,&quot; Dash countered.</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled. &quot;And when he goes a day without turning me into something, we&#039;ll talk about new ones.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.4 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Been a while since I started a loop this way....&quot; Twilight said, planting her hooves into the thick loam of the park. The same old book stood on an earth-pony stand, and a turn-stick within easy reach. She gathered up her things, letting her loop memories fill her in on her situation. She was &quot;Nightshade&quot; this time, her parents not having expected her to be an earth pony, and her cutie mark was a floral version of her usual one.</p><p class="double">She began her mad dash to the same library turret she always had. She almost stopped when she heard Twinkleshine&#039;s voice. &quot;Shouldn&#039;t we invite Nightshade? Moondancer wanted to give her an invitation...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why should we, only the social elite are going to be there...&quot; Twilight-Nightshade didn&#039;t recognize the voice, but she definitely recognized the tone from all the times she&#039;d tried to help Rarity get into Canterlot Society through the loops – especially the more political loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess you&#039;re right,&quot; Twinkleshine sighed in defeat. &quot;She&#039;s too good a mare to deserve the sort of teasing we&#039;re going to get.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">80.1 continued (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Berry Punch whistled merrily as she made her way to Mac&#039;s bar to unload a new batch of her creations from her pocket for the start of a new loop, when she was barrelled over by a grey and yellow missile. Rolling end over end, the momentary tussle ended with her pinned to the dirt by a smiling Derpy Hooves. &quot;Playdate!&quot; The mailmare shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... <i>what?</i>&quot; Berry asked, perplexed, and momentarily wondering if the pegasus was unusually forward and fancied mares this loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ruby and Dinky!&quot; The pagasus cheered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooohhh.&quot; Berry nodded, rolling the other mare off of her and dusting herself off. &quot;You want to set up a playdate for our girls?&quot;</p><p class="double">An excited nod.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, alright.&quot; Berry said. This hadn&#039;t happened before in the loops, but maybe it would be a good idea in the long run? Playdates sounded like a good idea, especially if she could convince Derpy to babysit when the bar was busy... &quot;How does tomorrow sound?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her reply was a bright grin and a squeak she normally attributed to Rainbow Dash. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.3 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Yeh can&#039;t just wash away all the farmland with yer typhoons and monsoons an&#039; all them other &#039;-oons&#039; yeh crazy cloud-brain!

She glanced about, spying thirty-two wheels of cheese, several upturned trees of various fruits which were scattered across the landscape, and a single rubber chicken.</p><p class="double">She clucked her tongue and continued on.</p><p class="double">Lying in pools of custard and fruit mush were her two friends, exhausted from their battle.</p><p class="double">&quot;This was about the environmental problems wasn&#039;t it?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">They nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know I just got done installing the thaumic conversion regulators that will negate the output of pollutants, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">They shook their heads.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course not.

I&#039;ll expect one from each of you, including a version for Looping Celestia next time she&#039;s Awake.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.5 (Masterweaver )</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Elusive and Spines glanced around the library, awkwardly avoiding each other&#039;s gaze. Dusk Shine rolled his eyes. &quot;Oh come on, you two, you knew this was inevitable.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, well...&quot; Elusive coughed. &quot;I&#039;m just... trying to get myself in the right headspace, darling.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is going to take some... getting used to,&quot; Spines added. &quot;Especially since, ah.... since, well...&quot;</p><p class="double">Dusk sighed. &quot;If you two have to experiment, do it at the boutique.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Some minutes later, the dragon and unicorn were back at Elusive&#039;s shop.</p><p class="double">“...it&#039;s not actually a boutique,” Elusive muttered, looking around. “More of a fitter&#039;s, really.”</p><p class="double">Spines followed his gaze. “Yeah, more suits than dresses – though I see there&#039;s still a few of those.”</p><p class="double">“Well, of course.”</p><p class="double">The silence stretched out for a minute or so. It really was <i>very</i> awkward.</p><p class="double">“This, er, isn&#039;t your first time as-” Spines ventured.</p><p class="double">“No, I&#039;ve been Elusive before,” the unicorn replied. “Several times, actually. It was an interesting challenge, adapting to doing mainly male clothing. Have you been, er, Spines before?”</p><p class="double">“Spines or Barb,” Spines replied. “Either name seems to come up. But... it&#039;s never been this <i>confusing </i>before.”</p><p class="double">“I know what you mean. Or, I think I do, anyway.” Elusive rubbed his forehead. “It was just something funny, before. But now, it&#039;s...”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s something we&#039;ve never really thought about, because we&#039;ve never been together in one of these loops,” Spines completed. “And... yeah, it is weird.”</p><p class="double">The awkward silence returned.</p><p class="double">“So, er...” Spines tried. “Does this mean you&#039;ve got a brother?”</p><p class="double">“Yes – from what I remember, that means they&#039;re going to form the Cavaliers,” Elusive replied. “Not sure why Crusaders isn&#039;t just as good a name for colts to use.”</p><p class="double">Spines shrugged.</p><p class="double">The silence returned for a three-in-a-row.</p><p class="double">Elusive suddenly blinked, then held in a snort of laughter.</p><p class="double">“What?” Spines asked.</p><p class="double">“I just thought... does this make me your husband?”</p><p class="double">Both of them considered that.</p><p class="double">“That sounds weird,” Spines answered. “But so does calling <i>me</i> the husband...”</p><p class="double">“Okay, I think I know how to handle this.” Elusive built up a spell on his horn. “I assume Gleaming Shield is Awake?”</p><p class="double">Spines took a moment to parse that. “Oh – yeah, ...Dusk said that she was. Wait, are we-”</p><p class="double">There was a white flash.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Honestly, I&#039;m surprised it took you two this <i>long</i> to run into the problem,” Prince Bolero said with a smile.</p><p class="double">Gleaming Shield shrugged. “We&#039;ve ended up like this quite often, actually. Though there&#039;s been the occasional time just one of us was genderswapped, too...” she tossed her head. “I&#039;m lucky, at least I have just one name like this. You&#039;ve only had the same one twice in a row... what, once?”</p><p class="double">Bolero nodded ruefully. “I&#039;ve been called Coda, Cody, Temporus, Canto, Authentic, and some others I&#039;ve lost track of.”</p><p class="double">“What matters is, though, we still love each other.” Gleaming smiled. “That&#039;s a good place to start from, I think.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, it sounds like it.” Spines nodded. “Thanks. Yeah, that does put my mind at rest.”</p><p class="double">“Mine as well,” Elusive added. “It&#039;s not precisely a <i>common</i> problem, is it?”</p><p class="double">“Ranma has it all the time, if I remember rightly...” Bolero mused. “But, then, his life isn&#039;t exactly a model of domestic bliss.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s encouraging,” Spines remarked, as they rematerialized in Elusive&#039;s shop.</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Elusive paused. “Perhaps... idea! I wonder if we should take the opportunity for <i>me</i> to court <i>you?</i>”</p><p class="double">“...we <i>are</i> married,” Spines replied slowly.</p><p class="double">“No, I mean for the benefit of the locals,” Elusive clarified, and Spines nodded in understanding. Then the unicorn got a mischevious gleam in his eye. “In fact, on that note, I really <i>must</i> design you a dress, darling.”</p><p class="double">Spines can be forgiven for getting a slightly hunted look in her eyes.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.6</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight?” Fluttershy replied politely.</p><p class="double">“Well... why are we all wolves?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy cocked her head on one side.</p><p class="double">“That doesn&#039;t help,” Twilight informed her.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid I can&#039;t help much, Twilight.” Fluttershy pawed the ground. “I mean, I don&#039;t know why we&#039;re wolves. But I do know how wolves work. Would you like help with that?”</p><p class="double">A multicoloured wolf shot past at a bounding run, laughing. “This is so awesome!”</p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash!” Fluttershy barked. “Come back here so I can give you the talk!”</p><p class="double">She paused. “If that&#039;s alright, anyway.”</p><p class="double">A chastened Dash padded back towards them, tail down. “Sorry, Flutters.”</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s okay, you were enthusiastic, it happens sometimes,” Fluttershy reassured her. As more canines – one with a gleaming alabaster coat, another pink and with a tail that looked like it was going to wag off – approached, she rummaged in her pocket. “Here. Let&#039;s have a nice meal and then we can talk about this.”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned slightly green under her purple fur. “Fluttershy... that&#039;s, well... meat.”</p><p class="double">“So?” Fluttershy asked, puzzled. “It&#039;s ethically sourced.”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Twilight groped for words.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I see!” Fluttershy blushed. “Sorry, I wasn&#039;t thinking. You&#039;re not used to it. I am sorry – here, have some soy steak instead.”</p><p class="double">“I... see. Thank you, then.” Twilight eyed the soy steak, still feeling a little nervous.</p><p class="double">Pinkie had no such qualms, making a wolf-line for the original haunch. “Hey, Fluttershy? Can I cook it with a honey glaze? Can I can I can I?”</p><p class="double">“Um... okay,” Fluttershy said, nodding. “That would be nice.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Cutie mark crusaders-”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara held up a large paw. “Point of order!”</p><p class="double">The other wolf pups looked round at her. “What?”</p><p class="double">“We don&#039;t have cutie marks, and can&#039;t get them as wolves,” Diamond stated simply.</p><p class="double">After a moment of pondering, Scootaloo raised a paw herself. “Propose that we temporarily call ourself the Ponyville-”</p><p class="double">“Wolfville,” Sweetie interjected helpfully.</p><p class="double">“Yes, <i>thank you</i>, Wolfville Junior Pack.”</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s better than nothin&#039;,” Applebloom admitted. “All in favour?”</p><p class="double">Paws went up.</p><p class="double">“Motion carried. Wolfville Junior Pack tail chasers go!”</p><p class="double">The meeting adjourned. Shortly afterwards, a tree collapsed as five frantically tail-chasing wolf puppies collided with it one at a time in quick succession.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, the barn it landed on was due for demolition anyway.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How in the name of the moon did you manage to get your fur this badly matted on day one?” Rarity asked, as Sweetie stood in the bath with warm water pouring down on her.</p><p class="double">“Tree sap,” Sweetie deadpanned. “Good thing this place treats fur shampoo research like Equestria does mane styling...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.7:</p><p class="double">Trixie finally had her chance to launch her most ambitious plan yet.</p><p class="double">She would return to Ponyville, and really show that Twilight Sparkle what a true artist did with magic. It had taken so long to plan, and even longer to prepare, but finally this was the time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Attention, Ponyville!” Trixie shouted, entering the main square. “It is I, the Great and Powerful Trixie! Hark well, Twilight Sparkle!”</p><p class="double">Twilight ran out of the library doors. “Trixie! What are you doing back here?”</p><p class="double">“What is Trixie doing back here?” Trixie repeated. “This!”</p><p class="double">She slammed a hoof on the floor, horn blazing, and a wooden stage appeared. Again, and her cape swirled with starlight. A third time, and several hundred identical Trixie copies galloped into the square from both directions, forming six lines facing Twilight&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rest of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">Then Trixie cleared her throat.</p><p class="double"><i>“The costumes, the scenery, the makeup, the props </i></p><p><i>The audience that lifts you when you&#039;re down...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“You were right, that <i>was</i> hilarious,” Chrysalis said later that evening.</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded, stretching out luxuriously on the huge bed inside her travel wagon. “I&#039;ve been planning this for <i>ages, </i>but never really got a loop with a stealth Anchor until now – and it&#039;s less funny doing this kind of thing when Twilight&#039;s looping.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis grinned, then stepped into the jacuzzi. “The hive still thinks you&#039;re weird, by the way. But I think Pinkie&#039;s practically begging that they help her with some heartsongs...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.8</p><p class="double">“Well?”</p><p class="double">Spitfire and Soarin&#039; exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“What do we do now, boss?” Soarin&#039; asked.</p><p class="double">“I... honestly don&#039;t know,” Spitfire admitted. “I mean... can you even do it like that?”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s no rule against it,” the hopeful pegasus pointed out. “I checked. Twice.”</p><p class="double">“It <i>was</i> impressive,” Soarin&#039; mused.</p><p class="double">“...all right, then.” Spitfire nodded. “Let me congratulate you on getting into the Wonderbolts, miss Scootaloo.”</p><p class="double">The orange filly jumped for joy, her cloud-board trembling under the impacts. “Yay!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the audience, Dash brushed away a tear. “Proud of you, squirt.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.9</p><p class="double">“...and here they are,” the host said with a smile. “The lovely ladies who&#039;ve become an internet sensation for their expert magic tricks. Leah Clearwater and Beatrix Lulamoon!”</p><p class="double">Leah walked in first, smiled, and sat down on the left hand couch. Beatrix followed her two paces behind, and slouched onto the other side of the same couch.</p><p class="double">“So, you two have taken the internet by storm,” the host began. “Simple magic tricks, flawlessly done, and recorded very professionally.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s all about presentation,” Beatrix said importantly. “I pull the tricks off, Leah has the whole Injun Mystic thing going on-”</p><p class="double">“Watch it, paleface,” Leah interjected with a glower.</p><p class="double">Beatrix waved it off. “Yeah, yeah. But she has a few tricks of her own.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m sure everyone&#039;s waiting to see them,” the host allowed, to applause. “But let&#039;s get into how you met, first...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How long do we have left?” Beatrix asked, cutting across a discussion of whether playing on stereotypical views of native Americans was appropriate.</p><p class="double">“Well...” the host glanced at his watch ostentatiously. “We have about ten minutes before the film at eleven.”</p><p class="double">“Right, let&#039;s get started.” Beatrix frowned, tapping her fingers. “Can I have a deck of cards?”</p><p class="double">One was duly passed over to be unwrapped.</p><p class="double">“Okay, pick a card. Any card. I mean, literally, any card. Not just in the deck. And, of course, don&#039;t tell me what it is.”</p><p class="double">“...sure,” the host replied, after a moment. He beamed for the cameras. “Well, this should be good!”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t you know it.” Beatrix threw the cards into the air, and picked one from the shower of pieces. “Is this your card?”</p><p class="double">The host examined the ace of spades. “No.”</p><p class="double">Beatrix smiled, and peeled off the sides of the card. Inside was a foil-backed Charizard trading card.</p><p class="double">“...how did you do that?” he asked, gaping, as he took the mint-condition card.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve got a twenty year old son, which means he was about the right age for the Pokemon card craze,” Leah replied with a smirk. “I provided one from my own personal collection...”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s amazing. I suppose it really is all about knowing your audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Beatrix Lulamoon!”</p><p class="double">The crowd applauded, some of them on their feet and whistling.</p><p class="double">“And now, for our last act, I will make a wolf disappear,” Beatrix continued.</p><p class="double">“But... we don&#039;t have a wolf,” the host said, confused.</p><p class="double">Beatrix grinned, and shook out her arms. “Nothing up my right sleeve, nothing up my left sleeve – except this little bracelet, of course-”</p><p class="double">Leah emitted a rumbling purr.</p><p class="double">At that point, the host, the camera crew and the audience noticed that she&#039;d turned into about a tonne of lupine predator.</p><p class="double">Before the shock wore off, Trixie snapped her fingers. And both she and Leah vanished.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That&#039;s going to take them <i>years</i> to figure out,” Leah said, in tones of deep satisfaction. “I loved the sleeves thing.”</p><p class="double">“Trixie tries,” Trixie replied. “Should we do a video where you&#039;re just randomly a talking wolf?”</p><p class="double">“Sure. Keep &#039;em guessing.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">79.1 continued</p><p class="double">&quot;You were absolutely right princess, the whole prophecy thing was bunk.&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;Besides, that&#039;s nothing to this old scroll I found in Ponyville library...&quot;</p><p class="double">She unrolled an ancient scroll that crackled as it unfurled and started reading.</p><p class="double">&quot; &#039;When the three tribes do fight a great battle upon the plains to the south of Mount Canter, then shall the great lord of chaos return. Blah blah, chocolate rain, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!&#039; Pfftt! What a load of mumbo-jumbo. As if modern ponies would start a war with each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Ah wanted that last cream scone!&quot; &quot;Uh huh, well I saw it first!&quot; &quot;But I wanted it too...&quot; Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo were by the desert table, arguing. As their voices got higher, there was the sound of a distant cracking, and a voice calling out, &quot;Freeee at last! Time for some chaos!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, you must retrieve the Elements of harmony at once!&quot; Celestia said. &quot;If Discord is free, they are the only thing that will stop him.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But the Elements are just part of that old legend, and we&#039;ve seen how accurate that was.&quot; Twilight shook her head.</p><p class="double">Celestia looked exasperated.&quot;Twilight, the Elements exist. I was the one who used them to imprison my sister in the moon!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. &quot;But that&#039;s only anecdotal evidence. You always taught me that claims unsupported by references or citations were a poor source of data, especially when the events happened so long ago. I mean, what sort of scholar would I be if I blindly accepted everything any-pony tried to make me believe? Right girls?&quot;</p><p class="double">The trio looked up from their own conversation where they&#039;d been ignoring Twilight. &quot;Whatever you say, sugar-cube!&quot; &quot;Oh absolutely darling.&quot; &quot;Uh, yeah, what she said.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.10 (Xward)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was on edge. Not for any particular reason, the loop had gone fairly baseline with little deviation except for Cheese Sandwich not existing this loop. No, throughout the whole loop Twilight noticed something strange: Pinkie Pie and Discord would sometimes stop what they were doing and gaze off as if expecting something. When questioned they said they were &quot;Waiting for something to happen&quot;. It was probably nothing, but that scared Twilight even more.</p><p class="double">But she should put that on hold, because right now she had to organize a band for Rainbow&#039;s Birthday Anniversary. All positions had been filled except for drummer. With each prospective musician lined up she was ready to choose the bes-</p><p class="double">*RUMBLE*</p><p class="double">Huh?</p><p class="double">*RUMBLE RUMBLE*</p><p class="double">Please tell me that isn&#039;t-</p><p class="double">*CRASH*</p><p class="double">Yup, it is</p><p class="double">Twilight beheld something she thought she would never see in her home loop: A Dune Sandworm. And for some reason it was wearing a... Stethoscope? Well never mind that, Twilight had a town to save</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, that should do it&quot;</p><p class="double">It had taken a bit but Twilight and Fluttershy were able to determine that a large amount of sand (Go figure) had been lodged in the worm&#039;s throat. They eventually cured this through water, and copious amounts of confetti. Fluttershy was of course the first to approach the worm.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what&#039;s your name big guy?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight expected a huge roar with Fluttershy meekly saying it&#039;s name to the rest of the group. She did not expect the worm to clear it&#039;s throat and get a drum set.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;They call me Doctor Worm</i></p><p><i>Good morning how are you? I&#039;m Doctor Worm</i></p><p><i>I&#039;m interested in things</i></p><p><i>I&#039;m not a real Doctor but I </i></p><p><i>AM A REAL WORM</i></p><p><i>I AM AN ACTUAL WORM</i></p><p><i>I LIVE LIKE A WORM AND </i></p><p><i>I like to play the drums-</i></p><p class="double">And Twilight found her drummer. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">82.1 continued</p><p class="double">Zecora looked around.</p><p class="double">Everything was white, with faint patterns of stripes that disappeared as soon as she looked at them.</p><p class="double">She was standing on... nothing. Solid nothing.</p><p class="double">Nervously, she moved her hoof, and tapped the surface. It made contact, but no sound at all.</p><p class="double">Thirty endless seconds passed in silence, as she tried to make head or tail of what was going on.</p><p class="double">Then, with a visible shudder, the nothingness dimmed. It gained definite – if faint – patterns, stripes of pink and purple on an indigo background.</p><p class="double">“Hi,” Twilight said brightly.</p><p class="double">Zecora whirled, mouth agape. “What the-”</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight Sparkle stood there, behind where she&#039;d originally appeared. She was in full regalia, complete with her Element gleaming on her brow, and had a smile on her lips.</p><p class="double">Then she giggled.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, Zecora,” she said, subsiding. “But that&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve ever heard you fluff a rhyme.”</p><p class="double">The zebraican shaman shook her head. “This is fairly overwhelming. To... on nothing be standing.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I imagine you are,” Twilight allowed, smiling wistfully. “I remember...”</p><p class="double">After a moment&#039;s silence, she shrugged her wings. “Anyway. Welcome to the alicorn club.”</p><p class="double">Zecora blinked. “Could that you please for me reprise?”</p><p class="double">“Welcome to the alicorn club,” Twilight repeated. “You constructed an alchemical circle with the intent of breaking Silver Spoon down into her fundamental components and reconstructing her differently, if I&#039;ve got this right, and you did it successfully – and in the presence of a powerful, if recently created, artefact. Well done, you&#039;ve got wings and a horn.”</p><p class="double">“I have horn and wing?” Zecora looked back along her body, and saw the dappled wings resting against her side. As she watched, they twitched involuntarily. “...I see your meaning. This is still seeming/ To be me dreaming. Some time is a must/ For me to adjust.”</p><p class="double">“Take as long as you want,” Twilight replied. “Now, as I understand things, you&#039;re technically supposed to have a severe penalty taken for undertaking Pony Transmutation. But you did it for Silver, so it&#039;ll probably work out – selflessness tends to.”</p><p class="double">“It was partly Silver, so what about her?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t think she&#039;ll be having much trouble.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon stared down at the cupcake.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t like it?” Discord asked, munching on his own. “Oh, do you want a coffee cup cake, rather than a tea cup cake?”</p><p class="double">He snapped his claws, producing a dinner service made entirely from silver. “The spoons are edible – I propose a toast! As in they taste like it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun, having another draconequus around!”</p><p class="double">Discord leaned in. “I like the squirrel tail, by the way. Very stylish.”</p><p class="double">“...can&#039;t I just shapeshift into a pony?” Silver asked.</p><p class="double">Discord&#039;s face fell. Then he picked it up again. “That&#039;s <i>boring.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Silver added, frowning. “Technically I <i>am</i> now a shapeshifter. And silver <i>is</i> a malleable metal, so...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, whatever.” Discord stomped off, producing occasional squeaky noises. “By the way,” he added, as he approached the wildly swirling boundary of the astral space, “if you can&#039;t smell anything, that&#039;s because the Pony Transmutation removed your sense of smell as the penalty. You&#039;ll get it back next loop.”</p><p class="double">Discord threw a fish at her. “Pity you didn&#039;t have a sense of <i>humour</i> it could have taken instead! I swear, these young draconequui, no respect...” he muttered, opening a door and leaving that way.</p><p class="double">After taking a minute to compose herself, Silver folded herself into the form of a normal filly and trotted for that same door – through which she could see Mac&#039;s bar.</p><p class="double">She still had wings and a horn, though.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>83.1</p><p class="double">“Do it again!” Dash asked, with the biggest eyes she could muster.</p><p class="double">“Okay... fine.”</p><p class="double">There was the <i>clop</i> of a hoof striking the floor, and then Rainbow Dash was a griffin.</p><p class="double">“Awesome!” she said with an enthusiastic grin (well, as close to one as a beak could accomplish), and flew off into the sky.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s goin&#039; on?” Scootaloo asked, looking skywards. “Oh, huh. Dash looped in as a griffin?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Silver Spoon replied, rolling her eyes. “She found out that I can do crazy chaos magic, and she&#039;s been pestering me to turn her into random flying creatures all day.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo blinked. “Huh. I&#039;d have thought she&#039;d already <i>been</i>... well, everything that flies.”</p><p class="double">“And a lot that doesn&#039;t,” Silver confirmed. She frowned, and her tail poofed out into a squirrel-tail, which she wrapped around herself. “But she says it&#039;s useful for double-blind testing of relative flight speeds. Or something.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.2</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon (AKA Quicksilver, Silverbeak, Silverback, Silverleaf, and just about any name with silver in it at various times) Awoke in a large, well furnished room.</p><p class="double">“Huh,” she said, intelligently. “This is... nicer than my usual room.”</p><p class="double">The bedclothes were pale cream and cloth-of-silver, thick and plush. A large wardrobe sat half open, with the hems of a number of dresses and other outfits visible within.</p><p class="double">There were a number of alchemical flasks on the dresser, along with a broken glass vessel (a sharp retort) and large symbols <i>Hg</i> and <i>Ag</i> picked out in silver on the door, above an ornate and stylized spoon.</p><p class="double">Very thematic, in other words.</p><p class="double">“Wait,” she added, looking down at herself and spotting a familiar squirrel-tail, along with a scaled arm and one with sparkling, starry fur. “Am I a...”</p><p class="double">The mirror on the wall liquefied, flowed over to her and reconstituted itself. The upside-down image thus produced confirmed what she already suspected – she was a draconequus. All her usual body parts as such a creature were there – a silver-shimmering raven&#039;s wing and one from a bat, the left leg with holes in it, a curly horn and a nub that barely showed above her fur...</p><p class="double">And, of course, the huge poofy squirrel tail.</p><p class="double">Further reflection (no pun intended) was interrupted by a clatter of hooves.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Silver!” a voice called. “Are you Awake?”</p><p class="double">Silver took a moment to recognize the voice. Nyx. Her sister, fellow daughter of Queen Twilight-</p><p class="double"><i>urk!</p><p class="double"></i>The young draconequus can probably be forgiven for falling out of bed as the loop memories coalesced.</p><p class="double">Only her erratic chaos magic, however, could explain why she fell <i>up</i>.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So you guys have had one of these before?” Silver asked, some time later.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we have,” Applebloom answered. “Back after DT, Scoots, Sweetie and I all ascended within like twenty loops of each other. It was fun stuff.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn fillies exchanged grins.</p><p class="double">“We totally spent about a thousand years partying and drinking before Twilight came back,” Diamond Tiara said with a grin. “So, how come you&#039;re a draconequus?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, were you not there for that one?” Scootaloo asked. “Silver and Zecora basically tried Human Transmutation – well, Pony Transmutation – on Silver. Big magic boom,&nbsp;&nbsp;Zecora&#039;s now a zebralicorn and Silver ended up as a draconequus.”</p><p class="double">“Huh. Okay, that&#039;s... not what I was expecting...” Diamond Tiara noted.</p><p class="double">“It rather came as a surprise to me as well. But at least it means that I can solve my species issues, and of course I also have this lovely bushy tail.” Silver matched action to words and wrapped it around herself. “Nice and warm...”</p><p class="double">Nyx reached out and stroked it gently. “Yeah, that&#039;s some good fuzzies.”</p><p class="double">After the others all admired it for a bit, Silver – Princess Quick Silver Spoon of Equestria, to give her her apparent title – raised a claw. “Okay, what are loops like this like?”</p><p class="double">“Well, we&#039;re all kids of Queen Twilight,” Nyx pointed out the obvious. “This is kinda like our version of those loops where one a&#039; the others is her sister. Or brother. Anyway, Discord&#039;s banished, and things go from here.”</p><p class="double">“She does try to make as much time for us as possible,” Scootaloo said, smiling. “Which is nice... but then, we&#039;re eight-years-old at the moment, and we&#039;re princesses. I think it&#039;s practically a constitutional and legal requirement that we cause havoc.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie nodded enthusiastically. “And she can always do what she did last time we got too much for her, and go have a thousand year nap.”</p><p class="double">“Presumably coming back shortly before Dad does, right?” Silver checked.</p><p class="double">There was no answer. Largely because the other five had turned to stare at her.</p><p class="double">“Before...”</p><p class="double">“<i>Who</i> gets back?” the other four finished the sentence Nyx had started.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Silver shrugged. “Seems obvious. I&#039;m a draconequus, you&#039;re all my sisters of the same age, there&#039;s only one other draconequus around, so...”</p><p class="double">Dead silence for several seconds.</p><p class="double">Nyx raised a hoof. “I move that we all try to forget that last minute or so.”</p><p class="double">“Motion seconded!” the other four alicorns chorused.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Queen Twilight of Equestria rested her head against the desk and groaned.</p><p class="double">She <i>hated</i> it when Loop memories were too detailed.</p><p class="double">And given how rambunctious the five Crusaders had been last time one of these loops had come around, and given how there was now a young draconequine added to the mix... she was going to need a lot of headache medicine.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, girls,” Twilight said, taking her regalia off. “I understand you&#039;re probably all excited to be royalty again – or, in the case of Silver, for the... first time?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve been an illegitimate daughter of Celestia once, I think,” Silver replied, frowning. “I wasn&#039;t an alicorn that time, though, and it never really came out.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight nodded. “Okay, anyway. There&#039;s a few basic rules. Rule one – none of you have precedence. I&#039;m the only one who knows what order you were born in, and I&#039;m not telling.”</p><p class="double">“Seems fair,” Sweetie said amicably.</p><p class="double">“Second, no hurting anyone. We don&#039;t want this to go the way of that poor Elsa from Arendelle, do we?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s doing fine, I thought...” Scootaloo frowned. “Isn&#039;t she?”</p><p class="double">“Well, yes, but I meant her baseline self.” Twilight looked over at Silver. “That especially applies to you, I&#039;m afraid – your powers are rather less controllable. If you&#039;re having trouble, just ask, and I&#039;ll see about setting up something to dampen them. Until then, though, try and control them as they are.”</p><p class="double">The draconequus nodded, frowned, and snapped her claws together. A bouquet of flowers materialized next to them.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that&#039;s nice!” Twilight smiled, touched.</p><p class="double">Silver was looking at her claws in irritation. “Yeah, but it was supposed to be a cake...”</p><p class="double">The elder alicorn shrugged. “Well, practice makes perfect and all that. Right, the third rule is – don&#039;t abuse your position to order people around. I&#039;m sure none of you would do that anyway, but it&#039;s just a point I&#039;d like to make.” She sighed. “After the hypersonic potato cannon incident last time, I do like to make sure of these things.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom had gone bright red.</p><p class="double">“Anyway, I think that&#039;s about it. The good side of it all is, loops like this are a <i>lot</i> longer than normal, so you can sort of stretch out in a way you can&#039;t in a normal loop.”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused, frowning. “Oh, something I forgot to check. You have your catalyst, right, Silver?”</p><p class="double">Silver blinked. “Catalyst?”</p><p class="double">“Reascending needs a catalyst. I gave Zecora one when she first ascended – one of the normal cosmic spectrum pendants, I&#039;ve got several spares – but I forgot that Discord might not necessarily have told you.”</p><p class="double">“I... don&#039;t <i>think</i> I need one,” Silver said slowly. “I mean, I&#039;ve shapeshifted several times in just that first loop... unless – oh!”</p><p class="double">The alicorns all looked at her.</p><p class="double">“I think I might have absorbed the philosopher&#039;s stone we used.” Silver&#039;s eyes lost focus for a moment, then she nodded. “Yep, there it is.”</p><p class="double">“Huh,” Diamond Tiara said, contemplatively. “That&#039;s convenient for you.”</p><p class="double">“Never expect a draconequus to do things sausage,” Nyx said gravely. Then giggled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.3 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The ponies gathered in Ponyville&#039;s town hall hushed- again, Twilight thought.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s birds warbled their fanfare. Again.</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare gave her not-brief-enough introduction speech. Again.</p><p class="double">The curtains opened to reveal nothing. Again.</p><p class="double">The mayor mouthed her usual inanity about there being a good reason, another pony commented that Celestia was gone, and Pinkie Pie complimented that pony&#039;s explanation. Again, again, again.</p><p class="double">Twilight had thought she&#039;d outgrown, so to speak, the frustration of having to relive the exact same moments so often, especially the first two days or so of the baseline before much could really be changed. She&#039;d been wrong. There were baseline runs, and probably always would be, when she had no new ideas on things to change or experiment with, when nothing better came to mind than to go through the motions for the umpt hundred thousandth time. And those baseline runs would always, to some greater or lesser extent, be more dreary than fun.</p><p class="double">And this time Twilight felt exceptionally weary. She didn&#039;t want to go through it all again this time, but every alternative that came to her mind had been done at least twice before. Nothing appealed to her. Not even doing nothing appealed to her.</p><p class="double">The only thing that kept her going, standing and waiting for the inevitable, was the fact that this wasn&#039;t quite a Lonely Loop. She&#039;d detected one other Looper Awake, and she was fairly certain it was Luna. But Luna had avoided her so far- no response to messages, making herself scarce when Twilight visited the moon to look for her, nothing. That meant, Twilight deduced, that Luna had her own plan.</p><p class="double">Curiosity about that plan outweighed Loop-induced boredom and depression... barely.</p><p class="double">After all the ponies in the room had begun chattering to one another about the state of things, all lights in the hall suddenly went out except for the spotlight on the balcony. A swirl of star-speckled smoke rose from the balcony floor, gathering in upon itself until it condensed into the form of Nightmare Moon, who sat on her haunches for a moment, stoic, apparently unmoving.</p><p class="double">This silenced the ponies for about three seconds. As soon as the first, &quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; echoed through the room, Nightmare Moon straightened herself up slightly. With the greatest solemnity she picked up a white-tipped black cane from the floor, holding it in one fetlock. Next came a large white straw boater hat, which she placed squarely on her head with equal gravitas.</p><p class="double">Off in a corner of the round hall, a tinkly piano played a brief hook, and in the span of four beats of music Nightmare Moon launched launched herself to her hind legs, knocked the straw hat back into a jaunty cocked position, and began to dance with high kicking steps, singing:</p><p class="double"><i>Hello my ponies, hello my subjects,</i></p><p><i>Hello to Ponyville</i></p><p><i>Open your sleepy eyes</i></p><p><i>Celestia&#039;s gone bye-bye</i></p><p><i>Bow to me soon now, I&#039;m back from the moon now, </i></p><p class="double"><i>The moon was such a bore</i></p><p><i>Oh baby this night will last forevermore!!</i></p><p class="double">The brief song concluded, Nightmare Moon ended with a spread-limbed pose and a grin to her audience. The ponies responded with frozen shock, except for Pinkie Pie, who tromped the floor with applause and cheered, &quot;Encore! Encore!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh... oh... oh yeah?&quot; Twilight managed to stammer out. &quot;Well, we&#039;ll stop you, Nightmare Moon! We won&#039;t-&quot;</p><p class="double">All further threats were cut off by the large whipped cream pie to the face.</p><p class="double">As Nightmare Moon&#039;s departing laughter faded into the night, Twilight wiped white gunk from her face and growled, &quot;Of course you realize THIS means WAR.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I keep telling you, it&#039;s Ivory Scroll now!&quot; The brown mare shook her head as her secretary left the room. &quot;Honestly, if they ever start looping... Ah! Pinkie. What legal bamboozlement do you want this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">The party pony slid into her chair. &quot;Pokémon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....The franchise?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, a pokemon league, except with any critter we can find.&quot; Pinkie pulled out a list. &quot;Timber wolves, vampire fruit bats, cragadiles... I&#039;ve got the mechanics down, pokeballs and safety spells, and I&#039;ve already run this over with Fluttershy to avoid being too cruel. I just need some sort of legal foundation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll tapped her chin. &quot;I think I can have something for you, but not this loop. Still, we can go over the paperwork and next time we&#039;re both awake--I&#039;d have to be there,&quot; she added quickly, &quot;mayoral authority--I&#039;ll set it up after Nightmare Moon&#039;s return.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks auntie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Scroll blinked. &quot;...excuse me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Some loops you and me...&quot; Pinkie gestured vaguely. &quot;On my father&#039;s side. I, uh, forgot that hasn&#039;t happened while you&#039;re awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. I... hmm.&quot; Ivory Scroll nodded to herself. &quot;Alrighty.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.5 ( Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;DAAAAASH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash barely had time to react before Twilight plowed into her. &quot;Agh! What the--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The new Daring Do book finally came out!&quot; Twilight&#039;s face broke into a wide grin. &quot;It&#039;s baseline too!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow blinked twice... then grinned back. &quot;SO AWESOME!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.6 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared at what she&#039;d found at the centre of Equis this Loop.</p><p class="double">The centre of the planet was... chocolate. Pure, sweet, chocolate.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to address her copilot for this expedition. &quot;Pinkie must <i>never</i> learn of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Agreed,&quot; Spike nodded. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.7 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight has been spending a lot of Loops with Lyra lately. The Geeky Unicorn was fun and quirky and often made her laugh. Also she had a variable collection of crazy conspiracy theories Twilight could enact in a later Loop.</p><p class="double">Twilight guessed that Lyra would maybe start Looping soon, therefore every Loop as close to the End as possible she made sure to play a collectible card game with Lyra. And play a custom Card.</p><p class="double">&quot;I play &quot;Yggdrassil Crashes&quot;! It will turn you into a Time Traveller trapped in infinitely repeating Time Loops, making you repeat the same stretch of time again and again until you go completely stir crazy and do anything to alleviate boredom!&quot; Twilight exclaimed in a dramatic fashion.</p><p class="double">&quot;I never heard of that Card... What&#039;s it do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Turn you into a Time Traveler trapped in infinitely repeating time Loops, making you repeat the same stretch of time again and again until you go completely stir crazy and do anything to alleviate boredom!&quot; Twilight repeated. &quot;Well, it will also sometimes catapult you into alternate realities with strange creatures and lots of adventures, where you can pick up useful skills, but that&#039;s not the main function.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra looked at her strangely. &quot;I don&#039;t wanna hear the Flavor Text. What is it&#039;s effect on the Game?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked. &quot;You will become so bored with winning these matches you will let me win.&quot;, she said smugly.</p><p class="double">Lyra blinked just as the Loop reset.</p><p class="double">Twilight Woke over the Legend of Nightmare Moon, thinking:&quot;I did this several thousand times now, but it&#039;s going to be SO worth it when it finally works.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.2 continued</p><p class="double">Queen Twilight Sparkle stood on the lawn of Canterlot Castle, looking fixedly at her daughters.</p><p class="double">“Any comments to make?” she asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“...not really,” Scootaloo piped up. “I mean, like you say, we don&#039;t often get a chance to stretch out like this.”</p><p class="double">Behind her, there was a cracking <i>rumble</i> as the top of the Canterhorn fell off. The large, pointed lump of stone bounced down the mountainside, flew through the air, and landed ten feet to Twilight&#039;s left.</p><p class="double">Then the bell tower emitted a strangled <i>clang</i>, followed by a <i>squelch.</p><p class="double"></i>“Really?” Twilight asked, sighing. “Blue cheese bells?”</p><p class="double">“Hey, it&#039;s not <i>my</i> fault,” Silver protested, putting her hands behind her back and twisting her tail with them. “I mean, I was kind of drunk, sure, but can you blame me? It was our twenty-first birthday!”</p><p class="double">“I can, actually,” Twilight informed her. “Because the legal age here is eighteen. You&#039;ve had three years to get used to getting drunk.”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Sweetie said, slowly. “It&#039;s not as though we&#039;ve gotten <i>that</i> drunk before. I mean, this was the first year they made that special commemorative coronation cordial.”</p><p class="double">“And I didn&#039;t know it&#039;d affect me that strongly,” Silver added. “Sorry, er, Mom.”</p><p class="double">“Well, everything&#039;s fine, so it looks like there&#039;s no problems,” Twilight said kindly. “Right, I&#039;m off for a well earned rest. I&#039;ll be back in nine hundred and ninety one years.”</p><p class="double">She vanished in a swirl of dim orange light and glittering stars.</p><p class="double">“That was quite a precise date, actually...” Nyx observed. “Wonder why.”</p><p class="double">“Eh.” Applebloom flared her wings, then turned to the others. “Okay, same thing as before? Rotating authority, so any individual one of us gets most of the week off?”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good,” they replied, or words to that effect.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...s&#039;not fair,” Silver muttered. “This isn&#039;t my duty day, why do I have to...”</p><p class="double">“Because you&#039;ve got the most experience at this. By, like, ten thousand percent,” Scootaloo replied. “Now, they&#039;re turning up in five minutes, so get to it!”</p><p class="double">Silver sighed. Then snapped her claws.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the delegation from White Tail Woods entered the audience chamber of the Hexarchy, they were met by Princess Scootaloo in her bronzes – and a doe they did not recognize, bedecked in silvery jewellery.</p><p class="double">“Welcome to Canterlot,” the doe said, smiling. “I am Princess Quick Silver Spoon, this is my sister Scootaloo.”</p><p class="double">The eldest buck bowed. “We did not know that your highness was a deer...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I&#039;m not, but I thought I&#039;d make you more comfortable.” Silver bowed in return. “Now, are you all refreshed from the journey? Drinks can be provided for our discussion if not.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...you really are good at that stuff,” Scootaloo complimented her, as the orange alicorn pulled down the sun and lifted up the moon. “You know. Diplomacy.”</p><p class="double">“Well, as you say, I have the experience.” Silver examined her reflection. “I mean, I&#039;ve been basically <i>everything.</i>”</p><p class="double">The moon&#039;s lower half cleared the horizon.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s me done,” Scootaloo said, unlatching her peytral. “I&#039;ll go tag in Sweetie.”</p><p class="double">“...this is all a kind of compensation for my not having had one of these before, isn&#039;t it?” Silver asked, then shrugged. “Oh, well. At least it&#039;s never routine.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.8 (Scygnus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright. So I&#039;m the Princess of Dreams. Dreams are strange. So I&#039;ve seen all sorts of really odd, off-the-wall things that Discord himself couldn&#039;t even conceive of. But this. This is... wow.&quot; Luna commented, flying alongside the climbing human.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a compliment!&quot; Vincent shouted, heaving another block into alignment so he could keep climbing up.</p><p class="double">&quot;But as much as I think Twilight will enjoy this system of puzzles, if I can duplicate it, I think I&#039;ll leave out the enormous human buttocks with eyes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NO! REALLY? YOU AREN&#039;T GOING TO GIVE HER THE PLEASURE OF ALL THIS DEADLY PERIL? I MUST SAY, IT REALLY ENHANCES THE EXPERIENCE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Truly?&quot; Luna cocked her head to the side, looking at the boxers-clad man with disbelief.</p><p class="double">&quot;NO! ARE YOU GOING TO PICK ME UP AND GET ME AWAY FROM THE GIANT ASS WITH EYES OR LET ME DIE WHEN I&#039;M TOO OUT OF BREATH FROM SARCASM-ING AT YOU!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! My apologies.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.9</p><p class="double">Trixie ran into the library. “Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Her old friend and fellow student of Celestia looked up. “What is it, Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“Nightmare Moon&#039;s attacking!”</p><p class="double">Twilight stood up, pushing her chair away. “Then we must go!”</p><p class="double">The two unicorns cantered back out the door.</p><p class="double">Their assistant, Spike, frowned. “What the...”</p><p class="double">Curious, he followed them out the door.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Nightmare Moon! Junipers!” Twilight said, in shocked tones. “So it <i>is</i> true!”</p><p class="double">“Who are you?” The dark alicorn turned from her triumphal speech. “Why do you interrupt me?”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s shock turned to a grin, one she shot Trixie who responded in kind.</p><p class="double">She turned, raised a hoof, and bumped Trixie&#039;s outraised hoof. There was a bright flash of light.</p><p class="double">“Wonder Twin Powers Activate!” they chorused.</p><p class="double">Spike shook his head. “You&#039;re <i>not</i> twins, and-”</p><p class="double">“Form of... an alicorn!” Twilight continued, causing Spike to stop mid-sentence in bewilderment.</p><p class="double">“Jinx!” Trixie said quickly, as the light cleared to reveal both of them with wings to complement their horns.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">“Why do you <i>always</i> turn into the same thing as me?” Twilight asked waspishly.</p><p class="double">“Because you always pick alicorn,” Trixie replied.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a good form! Very balanced, good for combat, highly mobile...”</p><p class="double">“Exactly,” Trixie countered. “I like those properties as well.”</p><p class="double">“Whence have two additional alicorns come?” Nightmare Moon inquired, in tones that made it an order. “I was not aware of thy existence!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, for...” Trixie turned to face the evil equine, and began speaking in terms suited more to a small child. “It&#039;s called a super power. Twilight and I are the Wonder Twins, we can transform into things. Don&#039;t you read comic books?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s bafflement appeared to only increase.</p><p class="double">“Right. Right, we can deal with this. Look, here&#039;s how it&#039;s supposed to work...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I... believe I understand,” Nightmare Moon said slowly. “So, rather than attack straightaway that I return from exile, I should establish a fortress of darkness and thence launch attacks, resulting in a continual pattern of strike and retreat?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s correct,” Trixie replied, nodding. “You&#039;ve got it. Now, I recommend that you build a base actually <i>on</i> the moon, because that&#039;s always cool, and start recruiting your evil mooks. I know a fashion designer who can do you some very snazzy uniforms...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Some weeks later, Nightmare Moon sat back on her Midnight Throne in the Sinus Noctis as her first battalion of Night Guard paraded before her. In their very snazzy uniforms.</p><p class="double">Her last confrontation with the apparently inaccurately named Wonder Twins had been complicated, with magical battle in the skies under Cloudsdale. Her night had held for three extra hours that time, before Twilight Sparkle had broken the spell keeping the dawn from coming and she&#039;d retreated to plan the next attempt.</p><p class="double">As she watched the thestral company pass in review, a thought occurred to her.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait a minute. Have I fallen victim to an extremely well performed scam?</p><p class="double"></i>She dismissed the idea. After all, she was a <i>proper</i> supervillain now. With guards and everything.</p><p class="double">Her idea of just taking over in one go was absurd! Why, it was practically <i>begging</i> for a desperate band of thrown-together heroes to stop her at the last minute, if she was understanding Trixie&#039;s lectures correctly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.10</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ciaphas Cain, almost certainly future Hero of the Imperium, leant back against the chair of his transport ship suite.</p><p class="double">As a Commissar, he of course got one of the officer&#039;s quarters, so he had a little privacy while he pondered the uncertain future of a new loop.</p><p class="double">Well, &#039;uncertain&#039; was a flat lie. He was good at lying to himself, but not <i>that</i> good.</p><p class="double">The future was dark, chaotic, and involved <i>far</i> too much peril.</p><p class="double">And to make things worse, his memories of his schola education included-</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the door, breaking his resigned reverie. Sighing, he got up and walked over to the door.</p><p class="double">When the door opened, there was a woman standing in the doorway. She was about average height, which meant several inches shorter than Ciaphas, and wore insignia he didn&#039;t recognize. (Unusual, but by no means ridiculous. After all, every PDF had its own, and with Lord Russ awakening ten thousand years into the past at times that meant that there was often <i>far</i> too much divergence.)</p><p class="double">“May I come in?” she asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“By all means.” Ciaphas stood aside, and waved her in. She walked to the bed, swept aside a few objects on it – mainly laspistol parts – and sat.</p><p class="double">“Ciaphas,” she began. “I hereby swear that I will do you no harm nor will I attempt to cause harm to come to you, by your definition of harm, while I am here.”</p><p class="double">The Commissar blinked. “That&#039;s... an unusual opener.”</p><p class="double">“It needed to be said.” She looked up, and her eyes were calm but sad. “As you may have guessed, Pinkie Pie is currently replacing one of the four chaos gods.”</p><p class="double">Ciaphas nodded, returning to his own seat and pouring some amasec. “It was sort of obvious from the fact that it&#039;s called the Eye of Parties again, yes.”</p><p class="double">The woman shrugged. “Well, party is as party does.” She rummaged in a pocket for a moment, and removed a laminated card. “Here.”</p><p class="double">She slid it across his desk. Ciaphas took it, tilted it to properly illuminate it, and hissed through his teeth.</p><p class="double"><i>Get Out Of Party Free coupon</p><p class="double">Good infinity plus one times</p><p class="double"></i>“...you <i>are</i> miss Pie, aren&#039;t you?” he asked, without looking up.</p><p class="double">“An avatar,” she replied, nodding. “I still retain the ability to make shadow clones and other such copies in many ways, which serves to help spread my influence and let me keep tabs on everything.”</p><p class="double">Ciaphas nodded, without otherwise reacting.</p><p class="double">“Ciaphas,” she continued, in measured tones. “The reason why I like parties, the reason why I&#039;ve <i>always</i> liked parties – and fun – boils down to how they relax people. Give them happiness. And it&#039;s clear that I&#039;m <i>not</i> helping you do that.”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “So, that card <i>is</i> valid. You just need to ask, and I&#039;ll stop – either stop the party altogether, or help you leave beforehand. I hope that in time you&#039;ll come to trust me and to appreciate my parties – but it really is your choice.”</p><p class="double">Her hair flashed bubblegum pink for a second, then she vanished with the sound of faint cheering.</p><p class="double">An envelope floated to the floor.</p><p class="double">With not a little trepidation, Ciaphas picked it up and opened it. Inside was a perfectly ordinary letter (albeit one written on paper that smelled faintly of icing sugar).</p><p class="double"><i>By the way, the uniform&#039;s Fenris Planetary Defence Force. Leman was kind enough to let me get a rank of majorette, which is nice of him.</p><p class="double">P.S. don&#039;t be surprised if a few dozen Light Eldar show up to help out. There&#039;s a company commander who I think might be sweet on you. Actually, do you know anyone called Amon Belethir Vae&#039;el?</p><p class="double"></i>Ciaphas parsed the Eldar name into Gothic, frowned, then realized it was more like a homophone than anything.</p><p class="double">Then, unable to help himself, he started laughing.</p><p class="double"><i>That</i> would look good on Amberley&#039;s list of accomplishments for the Ordo Xenos next time...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Diamonds?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sparkle, sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Diamonds diamonds diamonds diamonds?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sparkle sparkle sparkle sparkle.&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;Sparkle sparkle sparkle, sparkle.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.12 (TokoWH)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The loops weren&#039;t always the same down to the last little detail. Twilight had learned this fact so long ago that even when there were loops where Equestria was stationed on the moon or in a cyber punk setting, she could easily take it in stride. However, some details weren&#039;t always as pronounced as others. Occasionally, some more subtle stuff would happen that wouldn&#039;t change things too much, like AJ&#039;s farm being a grape farm, or one of the CMC&#039;s already having their cutie mark, or even her tree home being a few inches to the right or left from where it was originally. Nothing really too big or worth note, but it was there.</p><p class="double">There would also be time&#039;s where a ponies personality would also be different from how they normally were. It was rare, but it happened. Like that time Rainbow Dash could give Rarity a run for her money in terms of elegant upper class manners, or when Pinkie was actually fairly normal and nowhere near as hyperactive as she was in baseline -a fact that had made Twilight worry the loops had become unstable-, or the loops that must not be named with their hooves on Celestia.</p><p class="double">Twilight shivered. Thankfully, those loops were becoming rare as of late.</p><p class="double">Shaking her head, she could see Fluttershy&#039;s house not far off now. It was a lonely, so for now she was going to let things play out like baseline. She had a rather funny idea later on at the wedding that involved Chrysalis, an odd conversational &#039;judo&#039; she had planned that involved rubber ducks, and several buckets of soap and water, but that was a ways off for now. Right now, she was doing her usual preparations for the Summer Sun Celebrations.</p><p class="double">&quot;YeeeeeeeeeAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight turned around, Twilight&#039;s eyes shrunk as she barely had time to dodge a skateboard to the head. Raising her head, Twilight watched as a Pegasus skated off to Fluttershy&#039;s house. Getting a good look at the Pegasus, it took everything Twilight had not to laugh.</p><p class="double">There was Fluttershy, doing a front flip off the skate board. She had a blue baseball cap on, folded backwards with some of her pink bangs poking out. She dashed over to some nearby birds, a confident smile on her face as she refilled their feeders. Twilight was tempted to sent out another pulse to make sure it wasn&#039;t the looping Fluttershy messing with her, and had it not been for even the looping Fluttershy, despite the many loops she&#039;d been through, getting to this level of confidence to pull of a loop like this, she likely wound have.</p><p class="double">Doing rather well at suppressing whatever laughter that was desperately trying to make it&#039;s way out, she decided to continue on with what little &#039;baseline&#039; of the this loop that could be salvaged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, hello?&quot; she asked, approaching what could easily be mistaken as RD in Fluttershy&#039;s body. &quot;I&#039;m looking for a Pegasus named &#039;Fluttershy&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re lookin&#039; at her!&quot; Fluttershy said, giving a wink as she put her hoof to her forehead. &quot;Really, the name&#039;s a rather big oxymoron, but still!&quot; she continued, sticking out her tongue.</p><p class="double">Twilight was actually rather surprised. Despite her vast millennium of experience, she was having a rather hard time keeping a straight face. Luckily, Spike was quick to speak for her.</p><p class="double">&quot;That was pretty cool what you did back there!&quot;</p><p class="double">Finally catching the attention of &#039;Skatershy&#039; -Twi&#039;s current work in progress name for this odd variation of Fluttershy-, the Pegasus&#039; eyes lit up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! A baby dragon! Cool!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight watched in amusement as Fluttershy went over picked Spike up in a hug. Despite the massive personality difference, something never changed.</p><p class="double">&quot;U-uh! You can let go of me now, you know!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh? Oh, sorry!&quot;</p><p class="double">Putting Spike down, Fluttershy chuckled nervously. &quot;Sorry &#039;bout that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled, shaking her head. &quot;It&#039;s alright.&quot; looking on in amusement, she smirked. &quot;So, you like dragons?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy glanced back a bit, rubbing the back of her neck. &quot;Well... only if they&#039;re babies. Any dragon older than that kind of freaks me out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. More out going personality, but still Fluttershy deep down. Spike smirked, looking at Shy&#039;s skateboard. Spike gave a big grin as he looked at her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Say, do you think that maybe-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Twilight quickly cut him off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw! Come on! Please!</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aaaaaaw! But why!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I don&#039;t want you breaking your neck, that&#039;s why!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike frowned, turning around and pouting. Twilight rolled her eyes. Whoever heard of a skateboarding dragon anyways?</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Oh, wait, Spyro... right.&#039;</p><p class="double"></i>Fluttershy chuckled, before she noticed something in the distance. Not far off near Carrot Top&#039;s stand, she could see Angel poking his head out from a nearby barrel. Rolling her eyes, she gave a soft smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, um... oh dear!&quot; Fluttershy said, eyes wide in surprise. &quot;How rude of me! I almost left without learning your name!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;It&#039;s Twilight. Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m Spike!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, smiling. &quot;Nice to meet you both. Wish I could stick around and talk more, but I need to deal with this.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that Fluttershy flew back and grabbed her skateboard, before rolling off into town. &quot;Angel! No! Bad bunny!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Watching her roll off into town, Twilight stood silent for a few seconds, still resisting the urge to break character and bust out laughing. Even though she had something planned, she felt like it could wait. Now, she just wanted to see how this loop would play out. If there were a few things that were for sure, it was that this would be an interesting loop, and she would need to take pictures at some point lest no one believe her.</p><p class="double">Spike stood silent for a few seconds, before he turned to twilight and grasped his hands together.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Please...!&quot;</p><p class="double"></i>Twilight rolled her eyes. <i>&#039;And making sure Spike doesn&#039;t break his neck. That too.&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>83.13 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">To see Fluttershy of all Ponies come into Mac&#039;s Bar with a depressed expression, clutching at Angel like a grumpy teddy bear, broke more hearts than anything else ever had.</p><p class="double">&quot;Something against horrible guilt, please...&quot; Mac winced. Fluttershy having even accidentally done something bad was always something that hung around her for a long time. Still, Mac poured her a glass of Luna&#039;s Distilled Moonshine from that weird Loop where no Pony except the Princesses had ever heard of alcohol.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wanna talk?&quot; Mac started even as Fluttershy started shaking. &quot;Poison has to get out you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy clutched Angel even tighter. Finally she picked up her glass with her lips and downed it. The cool draught went down like silk and lubricated her tongue. It was almost a shame not to use it in this state. She shot Mac a dirty look which would have killed him if it weren&#039;t for his enhanced Hulk-metabolism burning the sweetness, but started:</p><p class="double">&quot;I am too cute...&quot; Mac was the only Looper who could have kept in his snort at that, once again proving his bartender ability. &quot;At first I thought that was just a joke she told me... I didn&#039;t want to be a monster Endbringer. I wanted to be the &quot;make peace with humans&quot; Endbringer, but...&quot;, Fluttershy began to cry in earnest, &quot;There just wasn&#039;t enough insulin!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.14 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Awaking in a human form was not a sensation Zecora was unaccustomed to. But to find herself inside a small craft flying through the air at the same time was definitely a novel experience. A glance over the side told Zecora very little about where she was flying: this brand new world was currently veiled in night, and under the cover of darkness there was no ground in sight.</p><p class="double">Loop memories chose that moment to reveal themselves, and Zecora prudently backed away from the side of her airship. The reason there was no ground in sight was <i>actually</i> because there was no ground to speak of down below her.</p><p class="double">Now then, according to her memories, her name was still Zecora. But instead of a Zebra, she was a human of the Silver Civilization, sent on a special mission by the Elders of the Silver Shrine. Her task was no simple one: Zecora was to recover five ancient gems called Moon Crystals and bring them back to the Silver Shrine before the primitive peoples of this world - Arcadia - could use their power to summon equally ancient man-made monsters called Gigas. Another Silvite named Ramirez had been sent on this task before, but failed and never returned.</p><p class="double">Her tools for the mission were...lacking, Zecora noted with a frown. She had an airship that even her loop-self did not know how to operate besides the basics, and mostly out-of-date information on Arcadia&#039;s current population.</p><p class="double">The bracelet on her wrist chirped, before morphing into a pudgy teardrop-shaped creature. It sniffed at her in obvious curiosity, then chirped again, this time more loudly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed, it seems your mistress I am replacing,&quot; Zecora replied, &quot;Though I hope you will aid me with the task I am now facing.&quot;</p><p class="double">There came a few more chirps.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are called Cupil? A pleasure. Zecora is my name,&quot; Zecora answered, &quot;Let us go together as friends, as the Moon Crystals we reclaim.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The first challenge of the night came upon them almost immediately - a large, metal airship that opened fire as soon as it got in range. Zecora considered trying to steer the ship out of harm&#039;s way, but none of the cannons on the other ship actually landed a hit. Instead, the air was peppered with explosions that rattled the ship like a tin can.</p><p class="double">Zecora did the prudent thing instead, and huddled down with her arms over her head. Cupil, chirping urgently, suddenly morphed into disc that floated over her head and helped to shield her from the blasts. Their airship was not so shielded, however, and there was soon a shudder and the sense of slowly dropping downwards that indicated damage to the engines.</p><p class="double">Cupil returned to bracelet form as the artillery barrage ceased, and the metal airship came in closer. Seeing soldiers in full plate armor, Zecora decided to keep playing it safe and feigned unconsciousness. The soldiers pulled her onto their airship as soon as they were close enough, and she watched through barely opened eyes as her own vessel sank down into the lower cloud layers. What a waste.</p><p class="double">Zecora found the term &#039;sack of potatoes&#039; came to mind as the soldiers carried her &#039;unconscious&#039; body into the ship, though the ride became a bit gentler as she was brought to the bridge.</p><p class="double">&quot;Admiral Alfonso, sir! We have the girl here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excellent,&quot; came the reply (it was a snide, upper-class voice), &quot;Now then, let us return to Valua at top speed. One such as myself cannot be seen lingering in such a low-class area as Mid Ocean, after all -&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a muffled explosion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wh-What was that?!&quot; Alfonso yelped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Air Pirates! We&#039;re under attack!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora gave up the ruse of feigned unconsciousness after she was rudely dumped into what felt like a small boat, and sat up. She had been carried all the way from the bridge to a cargo hold, and the huge door was opening to reveal bright pre-dawn light and a sea of clouds.</p><p class="double">Oddly enough, she <i>had</i> been dumped into a small boat, albeit one designed for flight. Deciding that the time for playing the damsel was past, Zecora climbed out of the boat and made her way into the shadows. Her Mokuton was not the only skill she had gained from time spent as the First Hokage.</p><p class="double">&quot; - perfect conditions for you to make your escape, Admiral Alfonso,&quot; a man in full plate armor was saying.</p><p class="double">The one who he was speaking to - with gleaming, elegantly-coiffed hair and wearing a shining, gold-trimmed outfit - reminded Zecora of some of the worst loop-variations of Prince Blueblood. Admiral Alfonso flipped back a lock of golden hair with one hand and sneered.</p><p class="double">&quot;My preparations are finished as well,&quot; Alfonso replied, &quot;Preparations to dispose of a traitor.&quot;</p><p class="double">Oh...this would not do. It seemed like the vain man was going to throw his second-in-command off the ship, then blame the dead fellow for the successful pirate attack. Zecora could not stand by and watch an innocent life be snuffed out so callously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cupil, we cannot let that man be harmed,&quot; Zecora whispered, even as she stealthily made her way across the hold as fast as she could, &quot;Your shapeshifting - make a rope to reach his arm.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cupil chirped urgently.</p><p class="double">And because Alfonso didn&#039;t bother to look back, arrogantly assuming that his plan was foolproof, he didn&#039;t see the Valuan soldier grab a silver rope that seemed to appear from nowhere.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold fast to the rope and we&#039;ll pull you in,&quot; Zecora called down to the soldier, &quot;We will not leave you to a fate so grim.&quot;</p><p class="double">Back in the depths of the cargo hold, Zecora heard shouting and roaring, as if some kind of strange beast was rampaging. Since it wasn&#039;t near them, she focused on helping Cupil pull up the Valuan soldier instead.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y-You...&quot; the poor man was shaking hard enough to make his armor rattle, &quot;You s-saved my life. But - but you&#039;re th-the...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please rest after your harrowing plight,&quot; Zecora reassured him, &quot;I promise that Cupil and I will not bite.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cupil gave a squeak, reforming into its normal floating blob shape and wiggling tiny fins at the Valuan in agreement. Somehow this sight did not reassure the man very much.</p><p class="double">There was a whoosh of air as the small metal boat Zecora had been dumped into earlier suddenly flew past, the now disheveled and harried-looking Alfonso flying it as fast as he could. It was easy to see why, as something that looked only vague like a cow was chasing his boat. Seeing the massive horns jutting out of each shoulder - and how they were crackling with thunder and blasting lightning bolts in Alfonso&#039;s direction - Zecora could only think that such a beast really wouldn&#039;t be out of place inside the Everfree Forest.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re supposed to be attacking <i>them</i>, Antonio! Not <i>meeeee!</i>&quot; Alfonso wailed as he made his hasty escape.</p><p class="double">Antonio, whatever sort of beast it was, had enough sense of self-preservation to stop when it reached the edge of the hold. Unfortunately, this put Zecora and the Valuan soldier she&#039;d rescued as the closest targets for Antonio&#039;s continuing rampage.</p><p class="double">The Valuan soldier, in a surprising show of bravery, scrambled to his feet and put himself between Zecora and Antonio.</p><p class="double">&quot;Run to safety, young lady!&quot; he ordered, &quot;I&#039;ll try to hold him off!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your noble gesture, I appreciate!&quot; Zecora replied as she reached for one of the tools in her pocket, &quot;But harmless, this bull I can make. And as for you Cupil? Form of a slingshot, if you will.&quot;</p><p class="double">You didn&#039;t live in Everfree very long without knowing how to deal with dangerous neighbors...up to and including the foliage. Cupil chirped, quickly morphing into a slingshot. Zecora loaded up a single bright blue pellet and aimed at Antonio, firing it into the beast&#039;s mouth when it roared at them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh? What&#039;s that?&quot; the Valuan soldier asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Concentrate of Poison Joke - and not a safe thing to eat,&quot; Zecora explained, &quot;Capable of giving a lightning bull a case of rubber feet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Antonio gave a wobbly roar and fell. One of the horns hit the deck and bent like it was made of soft rubber - which it was, now. With another sickly bellow, the beast went still. It seemed that being made of rubber didn&#039;t agree with Antonio very much.</p><p class="double">The Valuan soldier whistled.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s twice you&#039;ve saved my life,&quot; he said, turning and bowing, &quot;My name is Sub-Commander Abilio, I&#039;m in your debt.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My name is Zecora, and Cupil you&#039;ve met. We did only what was right, you owe us no debt,&quot; Zecora answered.</p><p class="double">Abilio suddenly whirled, taking a defensive stance once again.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re those Air Pirates! I won&#039;t let you lay your filthy hands on Lady Zecora!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pirates - a girl in a yellow dress and a boy in a blue jacket with a glass eyepatch - both sighed. The girl rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! Don&#039;t you know we&#039;re Blue Rogues?&quot; the girl retorted, &quot;Besides, you&#039;ve got a lot of nerve calling us <i>filthy</i> after attacking that poor girl yourself!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Err...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps we should calm down and go inside? Before the wind blows someone off the side?&quot; Zecora offered.</p><p class="double">That reminder shut Abilio&#039;s protests off immediately. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.15 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight entered the clearing near Zecora&#039;s house. She had a few potion ideas she wanted to get Zecora&#039;s input on. She knocked on the door and waited. After a brief pause, the door opened. Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not Zecora.&quot;</p><p class="double">The normally pink Earth Pony, now coated in white flour with black ink lines running across her body, giggled. &quot;Twilight, don&#039;t you see? Zecora is me! For I am dripping, in poetry!&quot; As Pinkie spoke, several ink drops fell off of her coat and landed on the floor. Upon landing, the ink spread out, writing out a rather risqué limerick on the floor involving Discord and a leprechaun.</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.16 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie has learned a new move: {Sing}!</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie wants to learn {Sing}, but Pinkie Pie already knows 4 moves! </p><p class="double">{Giggle} {Offscreen Teleport}</p><p>{Pinkie Sense} {Bend Reality}</p><p class="double">Do you want a move to be forgotten to make space for {Sing}? {N}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s why all the buffalo were mad at my song,&quot; Pinkie finished explaining to the very confused Cutie Mark Crusaders. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">83.2 continued</p><p class="double">“Where are we going tonight?” Princess Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hey Bloom.” Diamond Tiara grinned, and held up a bottle. “Nyx opened one of the old cellars, and there were bottles in there that must have been maturing for at least five hundred years, so...”</p><p class="double">“Nice.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie took up the explanation. “So we&#039;re taking about two each to visit the head of the Dragon council, and we&#039;re hoping we can get some of his special reserve off him in return.”</p><p class="double">With a snap of claws, Silver turned into a dragon. (Plaid. No, just kidding.) “I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll be willing to help us.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo cantered in. “Okay, girls, I got the chariots ready.”</p><p class="double">“Why do we need chariots?” Applebloom queried, glancing over at Silver. “I mean, we&#039;ve all got wings...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but we&#039;re gonna be about three times too drunk to fly on the way back.” Scootaloo shrugged. “I mean, that mead dragons brew is... whoo!”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.” Applebloom peered into her pocket for a second. “Okay, I&#039;ve got enough hangover cure for all of us brewed up. Is Nyx okay with this?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Diamond Tiara pointed out the window, to the slowly rising moon. “It&#039;s her turn anyway.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Nyx coughed as a cloud of dust cascaded off the old reports.</p><p class="double">“Faugh... how long has it been since we checked on these?”</p><p class="double">There was a slight <i>clink.</p><p class="double"></i>“Ooh, another bottle. Nifty.” Her navy-blue magic enveloped it and shifted it out of the way, adding it to the pile. “Right...”</p><p class="double">A report on the floor caught her eye.</p><p class="double"><i>In this, the year 20 past the defeat of Discord, the Queen Twilight Sparkle did enclose herself in sun and starlight and remove herself from the world of mortals, leaving her children to rule</i>.</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Nyx calculated. “So... it&#039;s the year 1010 now, which means... cool, only a year until Mom gets back. That&#039;s good to... know...”</p><p class="double">She blinked.</p><p class="double">“Wait, how long was it between sealing Discord and when Luna went Nightmare, the first time?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is going to be great,” Diamond Tiara said, as the chariots began their descent. “Just a nice night in with the ruler of the dragons.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Silver snapped her claws together, and a robe appeared around her. “Got to make a good first impression...”</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s with the Hawaiian print?” Tiara asked, looking at the complex web of colours.</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s a rule. Draconequus powers have terrible taste in clothes.” Silver swept it off, lightly scorched it, and put it back on. “There we go. Black.”</p><p class="double">A blur of starlight shot past them, circled around, and matched velocity. “Girls! We have to get us all back to Canterlot as soon as possible!”</p><p class="double">“Aw, <i>do</i> we?” Sweetie called from the other chariot.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we <i>do</i>.” Nyx sighed. “<i>Dad</i> is coming back. As in, tomorrow.”</p><p class="double">They took a few seconds to process that.</p><p class="double">“Back to the castle!” Diamond ordered. “Silver, please convey our apologies to the Chairdragon that we&#039;ve been called away on urgent family business.”</p><p class="double">“On it.” Silver spread her wings and rose up out of the chariot seat.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, girls?” Nyx said, in tones of distraction, as they dug through more old storerooms.</p><p class="double">“Yeah?” Sweetie replied.</p><p class="double">“If I ever start a prank war with Mom... remind me not to?” the black alicorn asked. “I mean, this has got to be the longest-delay prank I&#039;ve seen in a <i>long</i> time.”</p><p class="double">“I agree with <i>that</i>,” Scootaloo muttered. “Aha!”</p><p class="double">She pulled a large, golden box out of the piles of stuff.</p><p class="double">“This looks about right.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, bad news,” Diamond Tiara reported. “I found the ponies who&#039;d normally be the Element bearers – they&#039;re about the age they&#039;d normally be when Discord turned up. The tricky thing is, they&#039;re... well, not their baseline selves.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you&#039;re <i>kidding.</i>” Applebloom put her head in her hooves. “What are we talking here?”</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy&#039;s a weather pony specializing in fog. Dash is a personal fitness trainer. Rarity&#039;s a miner, Pinkie Pie makes balloons, and as for <i>Orangejack...”</p><p class="double"></i>“Whoa.” Applebloom nodded. “<i>That</i> ain&#039;t baseline.”</p><p class="double">“Nope. And Trixie appears to have a successful career as a stand-up comedian.” Tiara rubbed her eyes. “Well, nothing for it. We&#039;re gonna have to use these suckers ourselves.”</p><p class="double">She smiled up at them. “I mean, it can&#039;t be <i>that</i> hard. Everypony else who&#039;s had a Sisters loop has done it, right?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The statue shattered. “Ta-da! Alright, where&#039;s the popcorn?”</p><p class="double">Discord looked around. “Oh, this has potential... I like the variety of statues. Deer, dragon, griffin... really, Twily, were you trying to get one of every sentient creature here?”</p><p class="double">A twig snapped.</p><p class="double">The draconequus turned. “Ah, so good to see- you?”</p><p class="double">Five alicorns stood in a rough crescent, facing him. Above them floated a feminine draconequus.</p><p class="double">“<i>Five</i> alicorns! My goodness. And not one of them Twilight.

Are you all her <i>daughters?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Hers,” the black one confirmed.</p><p class="double">“And yours, actually,” added the second draconequus.</p><p class="double">“But that don&#039;t mean much.” The red-maned one tossed her head.</p><p class="double">“After all,” one with a pink coat started,</p><p class="double">“We kinda take after our mom,” continued the one with the <i>delightfully</i> clashing orange coat and purple mane.</p><p class="double">“<i>Especially</i> her.” The last to speak, a mare with a white coat and melodious voice, pointed up at the draconequine hovering overhead.</p><p class="double">They all frowned in unison, and with a momentary distortion of air produced six small stone spheres.</p><p class="double">“Oh, come <i>on,”</i> Discord complained, hands on hips. “I <i>just</i> got out of the slammer!”</p><p class="double">“Sorry,” the draconequus said, and sounded like she meant it. “But visiting hours start next year.”</p><p class="double">There was an explosion of rainbow light.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that went well!” Diamond Tiara said, smiling. “Easier than I thought it would be, actually.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Silver agreed. “I mean, I&#039;m a draconequus... and yet, harmony?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s what&#039;s inside that counts, right?” Scootaloo said. Then winced. “Okay, that was trite even for Equestria. But true, nevertheless.”</p><p class="double">“Hey... girls?” Applebloom said, plaintively. “Ah think we&#039;ve got a situation.”</p><p class="double">They looked over at Discord. Nope, he was still a statue.</p><p class="double">“No, over here!”</p><p class="double">They looked at Applebloom, to see where she was pointing. Then they followed her hoof up to her brow, where a glittering steel tiara rested.</p><p class="double">“Wait, has that got a gear on it?” Silver asked, drifting closer. “Is that... an Element of Magic?”</p><p class="double">“Is <i>that</i> what it is? Ah was worried it was a leavin&#039; &#039;gift&#039; from Discord.” Applebloom took it off, and examined it. “&#039;Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from&#039; magic?”</p><p class="double">“And I&#039;ve got a necklace,” Scootaloo contributed, lifting it over her head. “That&#039;s that cutie mark I got when I ascended...” A glance at her flank revealed a matching mark.</p><p class="double">“Same here,” Sweetie added.</p><p class="double">“This necklace has a tiara on it.”</p><p class="double">“Mine&#039;s got... a spoon. Of course.”</p><p class="double">Nyx cocked her head. “I&#039;d almost forgotten that was my cutie mark the first time...”</p><p class="double">“Oooh boy,” Sweetie Belle sighed. “Looks like we&#039;ve got us a complete set of working elements.”</p><p class="double">She paused, then shook her head with a smile and pulled out her device. “Of course it&#039;s not going to replace you, Clover.”</p><p class="double"><u>Well, yes, that&#039;s what I hoped. But still... wait, what kind of element <i>is</i> it, do you think? Who&#039;s got what?</p><p class="double"></u>“Well, whoever&#039;s got the Element o&#039; Loyalty could tell us, if&#039;n they learned how to use it.” Applebloom shrugged. “Absent that, though, it&#039;s waitin&#039; for Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Did she <i>plan</i> this?” Silver asked the air.</p><p class="double">“Could be, actually...” Nyx muttered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></u>83.17 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A sea-green coated unicorn sneaked silently into the forbidden section under Canterlot Castle. The regular guards were no match for her stealth suit, spells, and ninja-like skills.</p><p class="double">When Bon-Bon had noticed said skills and cautiously asked about them, Lyra had the answer. She said even though she wasn&#039;t one of Canterlot&#039;s wealthy privileged class, a younger her still needed to pay for her elite music schooling somehow. Lyra recalled being a part of a musical themed trio of cat-burglars. She was the ghost of the team. Earth pony Octavia was the muscle and Vinyl Scratch, with her bass cannon, was the wild card. Bon-Bon thought for a few moments and then said that she didn&#039;t mind as long as those days were firmly in Lyra&#039;s past.</p><p class="double">Lyra frowned at that thought. As far as the candy making earth pony was concerned, Lyra was visiting her parents. And in fact, she totally had visited them, right before jumping out of her old bedroom window and making her way into the castle at night.</p><p class="double">The sea-green unicorn scanned first for magical wards that would detect and alert if any pony scanned for traps. After disarming those, she scanned for more mundane traps.</p><p class="double">It took an hour of working slowly before Lyra finally made it into the chamber. The place that housed the artifact. The Artifact!</p><p class="double">First, there were the hushed rumors dealing with the fate of Celestia&#039;s former apprentice. Then came whisperings of Twilight Sparkle&#039;s perilous mission to recover the element of magic.</p><p class="double">Then Pinkie Pie blabbed the whole thing when Lyra casually asked about it.</p><p class="double">So here she was, pulling out a device that looked like a large radio with a dozen different dials from her saddlebags and aiming the little focusing gem at the magical mirror in front of her.</p><p class="double">Several years ago at the last symposium on poly-dimensional theory, Lyra saw the usual mix of unicorns and learned science ponies. However, there were a few surprises. The attendance of Celestia&#039;s new student, Twilight Sparkle, was not unexpected. The appearance of Pinkie Pie and Ditzy Do sitting in the back row, avidly taking notes and sharing a large feed bag full of muffins, however, was.</p><p class="double">Fast forward several amazing discussions with an unconventional baker and an insightful mail-mare, nights spent constructing a thaumic dimensional dialler device with those spare parts Ditzy recovered from a mysterious big blue box, and time tracking down an actual working dimensional gateway - all had led Lyra Heartstrings to this one singular moment.</p><p class="double">SNAP!</p><p class="double">The moment which was utterly ruined as Lyra looked down to see one of the essential dials had broken off and was now sitting innocently in her hoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;This isn&#039;t going to be good,&quot; she stated as her device started to shake and spasm. Three multicolored beams shot out of the focusing gem and impacted the mirror, causing it to glow. Then three beams shot out of the mirror, merged, and struck Lyra on her head.</p><p class="double">She was Lyra Heartstrings, unicorn mare. A musician and avid aficionado of the strange and unusual. Mostly stories of mythical humans with their dextrous hands and the legendary seaponies. She possessed neither ninja skills nor the brilliance needed to make a dimensional dialling device, but she was happy in Ponyville with Bon-bon. </p><p class="double">She was Lyra Heartstringer, seapony mermare. A musician, under the rule of Princess Trixie - who managed things (explosions) while the seapony queen was off doing battle. That Lyra was also an enthusiast of the strange and unusual, namely stories of mythical humans and earth ponies with their hooves and legs. She enjoyed competing in underwater musical demolition concerts/duels, but she had always felt something had been missing from her life.</p><p class="double">She was Lyra Heartson, human girl - a young woman, really. Although a little bit uncoordinated and somewhat of a klutz, she was a music student at a top university. Her dorm room had posters full of unicorns and space aliens. And space unicorns.</p><p class="double">She was... waking up in a room with the unmistakable scents of a hospital.</p><p class="double">There was also a space unicorn looking at her. Well, an alicorn with stars in her mane. Princess Luna stood next to her sister, Princess Celestia. The newly ascended Princess Twilight was also there, not looking very pleased.</p><p class="double">Lyra spoke first, &quot;It didn&#039;t work?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, &quot;If you mean, did you collapse three entire universes and set the multiverse back by a few thousand loops, then no. I&#039;m happy to say that it didn&#039;t work.&quot;</p><p class="double">The musical unicorn blinked in confusion, &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight strode over to her bed and sighed, &quot;What exactly were you trying to do, Lyra?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was.. I was trying to find proof that humans and seaponies exist,&quot; the sea-green unicorn stared at the princesses as she processed her new memories, &quot;And they do! I now have the memories of me as a seapony and as a human! I can prove it, too! What happened to my dimensional dialler?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The machine you used? Sleip.. I mean, some-pony higher up came and closed that little loophole that gave you access to a read-only universe&#039;s technology. He wasn&#039;t best pleased to find he missed one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra tried to process this new information. She spoke after a moment of silence, &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;With your little stunt, you forcefully changed your own status to active looper - something that no pony, at least, has ever done before,&quot; Twilight Sparkle sighed tiredly. &quot;Congratulations, Lyra, and welcome to the loops.&quot; </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p><hr></p><p class="double">84.1</p><p class="double">Applebloom yawned, then Awoke.</p><p class="double">She blinked. “Lessee...”</p><p class="double">As she crawled out of bed, she scanned her pre-loop memories. Nothing particularly unusual – by the looks of things, things were pretty much baseline.</p><p class="double">The filly slipped a hoof into her Pocket. “Cookie?”</p><p class="double"><u>Yes?</p><p class="double"></u>“Are any of the others Awake?”</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie hummed for a moment. <u>I detect Pansy and Clover. In addition, Clover reports that Diamond Tiara has opened one curtain in her usual signal pattern.</p><p class="double"></u>There was a <i>pop</i>, and a small scroll appeared on the dresser.</p><p class="double">Applebloom opened it, still yawning.</p><p class="double"><i>Nyx here. Silver and I are Awake – she checked in on me, which is nice of her. I&#039;m that evil Everfree spirit thing this time, so my other self is still evil.</p><p class="double"></i>“Good t&#039; know.” Applebloom nodded, then paused. “Wait, all six of us are around?”</p><p class="double"><u>Indeed</u>.</p><p class="double">“Right. I&#039;m gonna go ahead and ask Twilight for some help...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, that I can help with.” Twilight nodded. “You don&#039;t know what your elements are, as I recall?”</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah, except that I&#039;ve got Magic.” Applebloom shrugged. “Guess it&#039;s the whole Sufficiently Advanced Technology thing...”</p><p class="double">“Right. Hold on a minute.”</p><p class="double">Twilight vanished in a puff of magic.</p><p class="double">About thirty seconds later, she appeared again. “Here. One unattuned Element of Magic. I&#039;ve got the others as well, so just have your friends turn up over the course of the day.”</p><p class="double">Nyx popped her head out of the kitchen. “Ooh, can I pick mine up?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Can</i> you, actually?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“Easy.” Twilight grinned, and launched a bolt of magic at the five remaining Elements. It smashed them to flinders.</p><p class="double">“Right. Walk through the shards, and they <i>should</i> reattune.”</p><p class="double">Nyx did so, and watched as a sprinkling of stone fragments rose up to circle her neck. After a few seconds, they flashed and formed an Element necklace.</p><p class="double">“There we go.” Twilight smiled. “Shouldn&#039;t take more than a few more loops before you can summon it. Okay, Spike <i>is</i> Awake, so he can check you tomorrow.”</p><p class="double">“Why not today?” Applebloom inquired, curious.</p><p class="double">“I understand he and Rarity are setting up a dragon unrest house.” At the baffled looks the fillies gave her, Twilight elaborated. “They&#039;re offering package tours for dragons to go to Tartarus and get some excitement.”</p><p class="double">“...fair enough.”</p><p class="double">Nyx smiled brightly. “Okay! So, how do we do this?”</p><p class="double">“Well, the Mayor is Awake...” Twilight suggested.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon opened her wings wide, grinning evilly as the ponies of this little town panicked.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not Celestia!” the pathetic Mayor said, stating the obvious. “Filly Force! Come quick!”</p><p class="double">...that, on the other hand, had not been the obvious. Nightmare Moon turned, just as the doors slammed open.</p><p class="double">Two earth ponies, a pegasus, a thestral and a unicorn piled in through the door, wearing brightly coloured costumes.</p><p class="double">“Nightmare Moon!” one of them gasped. “So it&#039;s true!”</p><p class="double">“Your evil reign ends here, Nightmare!” the thestral filly said, pointing at her. “You can&#039;t beat all six of us – what?”</p><p class="double">The pegasus pulled her into a huddle for an urgent discussion.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon strained her ears to hear what they were discussing.</p><p class="double">“...what do you – oh, for the love of...” The thestral trotted over to the door and stuck her head out. “Sweetie!”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t <i>call</i> me that!” the voice of another filly admonished. “We&#039;re incognito, remember! Use our aliases!”</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>I</i> don&#039;t see why we have to,” one of the earth ponies said. “I mean, the villain&#039;s right <i>here.</i> If we win, it doesn&#039;t matter, and if we lose-”</p><p class="double">“It is the <i>principle</i> of the thing!”</p><p class="double">“Just hurry up!” the other earth pony called.</p><p class="double">A white unicorn cantered through the door, adjusting her own costume. “Sorry, girls... where were we?”</p><p class="double">“The speeches,” replied the thestral. “Ahem. You can&#039;t beat all-”</p><p class="double">“Can we just skip to the end?” asked the pegasus. “I have homework.”</p><p class="double">“Me too,” the black unicorn agreed, to general murmurs of confirmation.</p><p class="double">“...fine, then.” The thestral rolled her eyes. “But this is a one-off.”</p><p class="double">The yellow earth pony extended her hoof. “Harmony?”</p><p class="double">“Fusion!” the other five yelled.</p><p class="double">And then, to her great astonishment, Nightmare Moon discovered that they were <i>not</i> just a half-dozen overexcited children.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></u>“Huh. Okay, didn&#039;t expect that...” Spike closed his eyes, and took a breath.</p><p class="double">“Nyx, your one&#039;s Honesty. Scoots – congrats, you got the best element. Loyalty.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo did a little dance. The others regarded her with bemusement.</p><p class="double">“Diamond, you got the <i>other</i> best element, Generosity.” His eyelids cracked for a moment. “What is it with diamonds and Generosity bearers?”</p><p class="double">“Hay if I know,” Tiara replied.</p><p class="double">“Now, here, ah could make a comment about yer baseline self.” Applebloom shrugged. “But ah won&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">“Yours is magic, of course, Applebloom. Which gives you absolutely <i>no</i> authority, of course... or that&#039;s what we constantly have to remind Trixie, anyway. And Sweets, yours is laughter. Which leaves Kindness for Silver – probably because, you know, you&#039;ve been it all.”</p><p class="double">“Cool. Thanks.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;s a great help.”</p><p class="double">Once the others were gone, Nyx smiled up at Spike. “Honesty? Really?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Spike returned the smile. “I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s to do with how you&#039;re honest with <i>yourself.</i> You&#039;ve been through a lot, and you don&#039;t ignore it – you just accepted it, and worked through it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had honestly never been more interested in something purely out of amusement. It was different every time, and it never failed to be interesting!</p><p class="double">&quot;Say Ditzy, Just what <i>does</i> your cutie mark mean anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mailmare looked up. “Oh, hi Twilight. It means I can draw perfect circles freehoof, this time.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, that&#039;s... wait.” Twilight&#039;s train of thought applied the brakes, screeched to a halt, and went into reverse. “<i>This time?”</p><p class="double"></i>“Yep!” Ditzy beamed. “Last time you asked, it was making drinks fizzy. But this time it&#039;s different! And it&#039;s also different to the time before, when it was being an expert marbles player.”</p><p class="double">Twilight was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p class="double">“...you mean you&#039;re <i>looping?</i>” The unicorn paused, took a deep breath, and continued. “Okay, so... how long have you been... going back in time, and repeating things? From your perspective, I mean.”</p><p class="double">Ditzy&#039;s eyes uncrossed for a moment, and her tongue stuck out. “Hmm... carry the two... carry the three... carry the five other packages...”</p><p class="double">Then her eyes crossed again. “Since last week.”</p><p class="double">“...beh whah?”</p><p class="double">Twilight realized that that wasn&#039;t contributing to a useful conversation.</p><p class="double">“Okay, Ditzy.” She took a deep breath. “Explain how you can remember me asking about your cutie mark twice before, if you only started time looping this loop?”</p><p class="double">“Easy!” Ditzy nodded vigorously. “I only started <i>going back in time</i> last week, but I <i>remember</i> loads more times! Like the time when Dinky was a colt, and I was a stallion, and you were a stallion, and Nightmare Moon was a stallion, and-”</p><p class="double">Twilight held up a hoof, and Ditzy promptly stopped her in-depth explanation. “So... you&#039;re a Dreamer?”</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s that?” Ditzy asked.</p><p class="double">“When someone who isn&#039;t going back in time remembers the times before that,” Twilight clarified.</p><p class="double">“Ooooooh. Nope.”</p><p class="double">With a bleating noise, Twilight fell over.</p><p class="double">“But... you just described what it&#039;s like to <i>be</i> a Dreamer!” Twilight protested, from her position on the grass.</p><p class="double">“Well... I do remember things, but I didn&#039;t used to.” Ditzy rummaged in a saddlebag for a stick, and started drawing diagrams on a dirt path.</p><p class="double">There were lots of perfect circles.</p><p class="double">“See, in each of these circles, I just remembered that circle.” She pointed. “But now, in <i>this</i> circle, I remember all of the previous circles!”</p><p class="double">She paused. “Or, lots of them. I don&#039;t know if I missed a circle because I don&#039;t remember it.”</p><p class="double">“...right.” Twilight stood up. “I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll make sense eventually. Anyway, feel free to ask me if you have any questions, and Big Mac runs a bar for loopers at Sweet Apple Acres. I think I&#039;m going to go there, and drink some cider...”</p><p class="double">“Ooh, can I come with you?” Ditzy asked. “Dinky&#039;s still at school.”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought it over, then nodded. “Sure, why not.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vinyl Scratch, AKA DJ P0N-3 (though only when at work, or when in a restaurant and recognized, or occasionally when being interviewed for a colour piece) had a slight feeling of... wrongness, this morning.</p><p class="double">Oh, there wasn&#039;t anything concrete, per se. It was probably just the results of messing with a routine she&#039;d kept up for at least the last ten years, since she really made it big – work nights, get home and sleep days, ignore the seasons, and when asked to work days do it in zombie mode before crashing.</p><p class="double">And it wasn&#039;t like she was completely ignorant. She noticed the detritus left behind after major events – the return of Nightmare Moon, the times Discord started messing with the weather, that wedding she&#039;d been asked to do several years ago which had apparently involved an invasion... and, of course, the time a local pony had suddenly become a Princess.</p><p class="double">But she liked to think she at least kept up to date on the local music scene. That time five years ago when her old music became retro and really popular again, now, <i>that</i> had caught her off guard. But it was the exception, not the rule.</p><p class="double">Today felt a bit like that time had, actually. Vinyl made a mental note to check that she still had most of her recording disks and hadn&#039;t thrown too many of them out – if she could get the jump on this new trend, that would be <i>awesome.</p><p class="double"></i>Her train of thought was interrupted by a jaw-cracking yawn.</p><p class="double">“Whoah,” she said, blinking and shaking her head. “I must be less used to this than I thought.”</p><p class="double"><i>Right</i>, she thought. <i>What&#039;s on the schedule...</p><p class="double"></i>Her regular gig up in Canterlot, in two days. Well, that meant she could indulge herself and laze around for the day – at least, until Octavia got back from <i>her</i> regular gig.</p><p class="double">(For some reason, her flatmate preferred to relax with a glass of wine and a book, not lying sprawled on the sofa with thumping music playing. There was no accounting for taste.)</p><p class="double">But first, something sweet from the Cakes sounded nice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>You know, I should probably go out in daylight more often,</i> Vinyl thought to herself as the summery scents wafted through the air. It really was a beautiful day, with only a few fluffy clouds in the sky.</p><p class="double">Something purple caught her eye.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hey, Twilight. Er, I mean, your high...”</p><p class="double">Vinyl stopped talking in confusion.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, Princess of Magic, was giving her a quizzical look. But as far as Vinyl was concerned, <i>she</i> was the one who should be giving quizzical looks.</p><p class="double">First off, Twilight Sparkle <i>wasn&#039;t</i> a Princess. Her wings had gone, she was a good few inches shorter and she wasn&#039;t wearing any of the stuff she&#039;d started wearing back when she became a princess.</p><p class="double">Second, there was a unicorn standing right next to her. A unicorn filly, to be precise, but one Vinyl had never seen before – and one who looked strange enough that Vinyl could <i>swear</i> she&#039;d have remembered seeing her. Not many ponies had vertical slit pupils.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s wrong, momma?” the young unicorn asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes narrowed slightly. “Vinyl Scratch. Are you used to seeing me with wings?”</p><p class="double">“Well... yeah, actually. What happened?”</p><p class="double">The filly grinned. “Woo, another new looper!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So... <i>ten</i> years since I first arrived in Ponyville?” Twilight checked. “Huh. And the last five years you haven&#039;t noticed any deja vu or anything?”</p><p class="double">“Well, there were a few things, now I think about it. Nothing major, though – I mean, Discord got out that other time, which I suppose must have been the first time just... again.” Vinyl sipped at the cocoa Twilight had made them. “Apart from that, no. And how come you were an alicorn that time, then?”</p><p class="double">“I think I know which loop you mean.” Twilight frowned, then nodded. “I was a naturally-born alicorn. Chrysalis, the Princesses and I were Awake, so no second wedding invasion... I talked Trixie round both times, you might not even have noticed... Luna just turned up one day and Celestia rolled with it, though there was a bit of gossip... oh, and of course, no mess-up with Star Swirl&#039;s spell. Either time.”</p><p class="double">“Huh. Kinda a neat coincidence,” Nyx observed. “I mean, that&#039;s Vinyl, and Ditzy, and Lyra who all got started recently.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah...” Twilight agreed, then paused. “Hold on.”</p><p class="double">She reached under the desk and pulled out a large diary. Opening it, she flipped through to a page covered with dense writing.</p><p class="double">“Right, so Ditzy started then... and I&#039;d asked her that in her first loop... I actually think all three of them started within <i>two loops</i> of one another, though their second loops were a bit more spaced out.”</p><p class="double">Nyx blinked. “Really? Doesn&#039;t that sort of thing usually happen with a crash?”</p><p class="double">“Hey, quick question?” Vinyl raised a hoof. “Should I understand what you two are talking about?”</p><p class="double">“Probably not,” Nyx informed her cheerfully.</p><p class="double">Twilight tapped her cup on the table. “Three new loopers... hmm, it&#039;s probably linked to when Lyra nearly accidentally her whole history. And <i>that</i> involved <i>four</i> alternate selves.”</p><p class="double">“So...” Nyx prompted.</p><p class="double">“So I&#039;m not sure who the fourth would be. But we&#039;d better keep an eye out. The <i>last</i> thing we want is Sombra looping.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Ah, Hogwarts,</i> Rarity thought, smiling.</p><p class="double">A castle full of young teenagers learning magic. Arguably, one of the most dangerous environments in the multiverse.</p><p class="double">(Granted, a lot of that was because the local Anchor was breathtakingly old, immensely skilled and thoroughly... amorous. But he had manners, which was nice.)</p><p class="double">The most immediate downside to the place was a subsection of Slytherin House. There were certain among her fellow pupils from the Green side of the school who considered her – and anyone else who wasn&#039;t born to wizarding ancestors as far back as the family tree could reach – inferior. Frankly, it was all ridiculous tosh.</p><p class="double">And at least not <i>all</i> Snakes were like that.</p><p class="double">Case in point.</p><p class="double">“My fair lady,” the athletic youth before her asked, taking her hand and kissing it. “Would you do me the honour of accompanying me to the Yule Ball?”</p><p class="double">“I would be delighted, sirrah,” she replied, smoothing her blue-edged robes and standing. “What time would you be wishful for me to arrive?”</p><p class="double">Spike winked at her. “Seven of the clock, fair lady.”</p><p class="double">“Wonderful. Oh, do tell me – how are things in the land of reptiles?”</p><p class="double">The young wizard tapped his chin. “Well, I&#039;ve instituted an unofficial policy of removing one item of clothing from the wardrobes of anyone who does something stupid and prejudiced.”</p><p class="double">“So <i>that&#039;s</i> why Master Malfoy&#039;s robes are looking tattered.” Rarity nodded, then kissed him.</p><p class="double">“Not too long now,” she whispered.</p><p class="double">“I know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord&#039;s statue shattered. “Oh, yeah, baby! I&#039;m ba-ack!”</p><p class="double">A hoof tapped him on the shoulder.</p><p class="double">“Lulu, what a surprise,” he said as he turned. “How long has it been?”</p><p class="double">“One thousand and eleven years,” Princess Luna replied promptly. “And four months, eight days, nine hours and fourteen minutes.”</p><p class="double">“Such <i>precision.</i>” Discord yawned. “I&#039;m getting bored already. Did you have something amusing to say?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, actually.” Luna held up a large document. “You owe one thousand and ten years, nine months, seven days, four hours and twelve minutes child support.”</p><p class="double">“...za?”</p><p class="double">Luna had to fight the urge to giggle. Seeing Discord shocked was always entertaining.</p><p class="double">“Child support?” he repeated, slowly. Then laughed. “Oh, such an amusing prank! As if I could possibly owe child support!”</p><p class="double">“Mummy?” a voice whined. “Are you still busy?”</p><p class="double">A female draconequus walked around the end of a hedge, dragging an ursa-major teddy bear in one mismatched paw.</p><p class="double">“I still am, Silvy,” Luna told her, smiling. “Not for much longer, though. Your deadbeat dad is going to pay up or turn back to stone, and I&#039;ll be available.”</p><p class="double">Discord fell over in a dead faint.</p><p class="double">Silver and Luna exchanged a hoofbump/high five, grinning.</p><p class="double">“Did you like the whine?” Silver asked. “I thought it was a nice touch...”</p><p class="double">“Marvellous,” Luna replied. “The look on his face...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.6</p><p class="double">“Ditzy,” Twilight began uncertainly. “Are you Awake this loop?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” the mailmare replied cheerfully. “What is it, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Twilight frowned. “Okay, two things, really. First – there have been loops where you&#039;ve been called... well, Derpy. And... well, I was wondering whether you&#039;re...”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s sentence trailed off into silence, as she tried to work out how to express it.</p><p class="double">“Oooooh.” The grey pegasus nodded, looking Twilight in the eye. (The other eye was looking directly upwards.) “I don&#039;t mind. It&#039;s a name, it refers to me, and it sounds funny!” She giggled. “Derp. Derpity derpity derp. And what do I care?”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “Bright Eyes works too. In fact, I&#039;ve been all three at once! Now, what was the other thing?”</p><p class="double">The Anchor shook her head, a smile on her lips. “Your attitude is really refreshing. If incomprehensible. Anyway, the other thing was – what&#039;s your special talent this time?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right. Well...” Ditzy paused. “I&#039;m not sure. Let&#039;s see. Can you stand back a bit?”</p><p class="double">Twilight took a few steps back.</p><p class="double">Ditzy concentrated, and frowned. A cloud of bubbles came out of her ears.</p><p class="double">“Ah, the old standby,” Twilight began. Then there was a loud <i>bang</i>.</p><p class="double">“Yay!” Ditzy said, standing in the lower half of a sphere that had been wiped from existence. “I thought so! I can do loads of them!”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s brain paused, went into rewind, and hit play again. “...are you telling me that you can pick and choose <i>any</i> of the cutie mark meanings you remember?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Ditzy sneezed, and when the flash died down she had a horn to go with her wings. “Hey, look, I&#039;ve got a horn!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, you know what?” Twilight shook her head. “I&#039;m not even going to question it. Congratulations on joining the alicorn club, it helps if you&#039;ve thought of your evil self beforehand.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Name?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“And your team name?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled uncertainly. “Alicorn.”</p><p class="double">The functionary looked up. “<i>Alicorn,</i> you say?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s correct. Here&#039;s the roster.”</p><p class="double">With raised eyebrow, the clerk went down the list. “Hm... interesting, the royals of the Crystal Empire are on here... and their Highnesses?”</p><p class="double">“Celestia wanted to participate.” Twilight shrugged. “I was glad to help.”</p><p class="double">“But... not all of these are alicorns?”</p><p class="double">“I wasn&#039;t aware team names had to be accurate. Besides, we&#039;re the only team with alicorns on.” Twilight grinned. “Is everything alright?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, yes, fine indeed.” The clerk stamped the papers. “Very good.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Isn&#039;t this... I dunno, a bit obvious for a prank?” Dash asked. “I mean, sure, it&#039;s kinda amusing, but...”</p><p class="double">Twilight winked. “Oh, ye of little faith.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right.” Gilda pointed. “Okay, Sunbutt, Moonbutt, Twinklebutt and Wandbutt, you four are on relay. Dash, you&#039;re the best at speed and you can sustain it longest, so you&#039;re on the marathon, and Flutterbutt is doing the sprint – Balloonbutt, burst a paper bag behind her or something...”</p><p class="double">“Er, excuse me?” the functionary asked her. “But... this <i>is</i> team Alicorn, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, so?” Gilda gave him an eagle-eyed look. “You got something against an entire team turning themselves into gryphons via a chaos god in order to compete in the Equestria Games?”</p><p class="double">“Well... not as such, no. It&#039;s just... I expected...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, and expectations make nations expectorate, or something. I&#039;ve got a team to shout at – I mean, organize.” Gilda turned away. “Bubblebutt, you&#039;re on the obstacle course. Applebutt, other applebutt, you&#039;re on the wrestling and boxing, I&#039;ll let you work out which one...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.8</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Excuse me, Princess...”</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight Sparkle, younger ruler of Equestria, looked down with puzzlement at the mare before her Night Court. “What is it, Vinyl Scratch?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” The white-coated unicorn frowned, and took her goggles off. “I... everything seems very strange, all of a sudden. I&#039;d thought you&#039;d just become a Princess, right? And then, next month, you&#039;re...” Vinyl shrugged. “You&#039;re, like, the second-ranked Princess of Equestria who just got back from the moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;And suddenly I&#039;m five years in the past. And I don&#039;t get it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. She could <i>swear</i> Vinyl had already had her Awakening conversation. Unless she was just unfamiliar with variant loops?</p><p class="double">No, that didn&#039;t make sense either. Her first two loops had been variant.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” she said, deciding to just go with the full explanation all over again. “There is a pattern of events which is known as the Time Loops...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.9 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s like... I&#039;m not even sure if anyone takes me seriously. I know I mess things up a lot and I can give off that &#039;stupid happy&#039; vibe... most of the time... but it doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t matter, right?&quot; She asked, poking at her dinner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Derpy...&quot; Harry started, nudging the little ravenclaw. &quot;You looped in as Luna bloody Lovegood. That tells me one of two things; you&#039;re either <i>incredibly amazing</i>, Cuckoo <i>right out</i> the Lander, or both.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yaaay!&quot; She cheered, her arms shooting upward accidentally knocking her bread pudding (somehow made from muffins) onto, down, and <i>into</i> Cho&#039;s blouse.</p><p class="double">Harry palmed his face, glasses and all, as the older girl screamed and ran from the hall. &quot;I just haven&#039;t figured out <i>which</i>, yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still yay!&quot; The blonde was undeterred. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.10 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Twilight, you&#039;re a smart pony, right? Tell Octavia that my crazy theory is correct and that if you listen to enough wubs, time starts to dubstep!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “Welcome to the loops, Vinyl.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.11 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, Commander Data, let&#039;s bring this new computer core online.&quot; Jean-Luc said, only the faintest trace of hesitance evident in his voice. Starfleet had been on an Artificial Intelligence kick this loop, and wanted several ships (Including the Enterprise, naturally) to field-test their new ship AIs.</p><p class="double">He just hoped it wasn&#039;t Skynet again. Or GLADoS. Or HAL. Or...</p><p>Let&#039;s just say this had a monumentally small chance of actually going well.</p><p class="double">But, orders were orders...</p><p class="double">Data initiated the power link and typed in the startup code. Now was the moment of truth, and every looper on board tensed slightly-</p><p class="double">&quot;HI! I&#039;m Derpy!&quot;</p><p class="double">Picard flinched as Diana let out a startled yelp. She never did like artificial minds... &quot;Hello... er, <i>Derpy</i>. You&#039;ve been installed as the computer system on my ship, the Enterprise. My name is Captain Jean-luc Picard.&quot; He paused. &quot;If I may ask, why &#039;derpy&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">The ship <i>scoffed</i>. &quot;Well what do you <i>think</i> the &#039;D&#039; was supposed to stand for?&quot;</p><p class="double">He palmed his face and nodded at Data&#039;s raised eyebrow. Yes, definitely a looper. &quot;Alphabetic ordering?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, that&#039;s boring. Hey! Let&#039;s make <i>muffins!&quot;</p><p class="double"></i>Thankfully, they were still in spacedock, and had the assistance of the dock&#039;s technitians to convince her that she could use the replicators to generate muffins and did not need to bake them herself. With the ship&#039;s phaser banks.</p><p class="double">It was going to be a long loop. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.12 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight hummed to herself as she walked down the road to Fluttershy&#039;s house. It felt like most of the Elements were Awake this time, so Twilight had thought up a few plans for some stage shows. She had exchanged a few quick notes with Trixie (using the Mail-Flame Spell), and was looking to get the rest of the Elements in on the activities.</p><p class="double">Twilight came around the edge of the house to see a truly off-putting sight. Fluttershy was standing just outside of her cabin, talking to an enormous, black-coated goat. Fluttershy turned at her approach, and smiled. Twilight quickly trotted over to join them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Visiting Looper?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. &quot;Oh yes. He has just been telling me about the many creatures he is friends with.&quot;</p><p class="double">The goat nodded, somewhat shyly, which was an odd look for such a large creature. &quot;Aye, I was jus&#039; tellin&#039; her &#039;bout a few of me friends, back at &#039;Ogwarts. Oh, almost forgot. My name&#039;s Hagrid, Keeper o&#039; the Keys and Grounds of &#039;Ogwarts.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...a shame that my assistant isn&#039;t here this Loop. I think he might be in the Griffon Lands for some reason.&quot; Twilight finished telling Hagrid about Spike, who had looked a mixture of happy and sorrowful at hearing about the baby dragon. They were currently gathered around Fluttershy&#039;s table, Hagrid having actually shrunk slightly to fit. He had apparently recently had a Loop as Ant-Man in the Marvel Universe, and he apparently loved the ability to change his size.</p><p class="double">&quot;Blimey. I can&#039;t wait to get to talk to a dragon. Always wanted to raise one, see, but never could. If I keep Norberta, the Ministry comes to take &#039;er away.&quot; Hagrid started sniffling as Fluttershy moved to comfort him. Twilight nodded thoughtfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;One way I&#039;ve seen it work, when I was replacing Hermione, was to apply for a Dragon Guard License, as well as to register Norberta as part of the Care of Magical Creatures menagerie. The Laws should be on the books in your baseline, I will have to see if I still have notes from that Loop.&quot; Hagrid looked up, eyes watering.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can see why yeh would be replacing &#039;Ermione. You talk jus&#039; like her when she&#039;s got summit to say.&quot; Twilight smiled, then her smile widened as a thought came to her.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, I was planning a sort of stage show, and I think you might be able to help. Fluttershy as well.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blushed as she watched their attempted stage performance. It was meant to be an adaption of the story of the fight against Tirek. With his ability to change size, and his naturally dark, coarse coat, Hagrid has seemed like a perfect fit. Unfortunately, his accent and personality didn&#039;t match with the role.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll get yeh ponies! I&#039;ll turn yeh into my, er, monsters, em. Well, more like misunderstood creatures, but, uhm...&quot; Hagrid&#039;s voice trailed off as he lost his place in the dialogue yet again. Helpfully, Fluttershy gasped, before transforming into her dire wolf form with a howl.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no, they got Firefly.&quot; Twilight facehoofed at Dash&#039;s monotonic delivery.</p><p class="double">&quot;I did? Ahem, ah, I mean, yah, I did &#039;n you&#039;re next.&quot; Oh well, the audience at least was enjoying it. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.13 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So there I was,&quot; Vinyl Scratch said, hugging her drink for comfort, &quot;wondering what had happened to all my &#039;No Bucks to Give&#039; tracks. I couldn&#039;t find the records ANYWHERE. So I went out to the record shop, and Needles told me he&#039;d never heard of the group. And I laughed, &#039;cause Needles is like that, he&#039;s a joker, right? Never heard of the hottest sound to come out of a barn band in the last year?</p><p class="double">&quot;Only thing was,&quot; the unicorn pony added, draining the glass and handing it out for a refill before restoring it to her teddy-bear hug, &quot;only thing was, he wasn&#039;t joking.</p><p class="double">&quot;And that was when I noticed that the calendars were all wrong, and I&#039;d slipped four, maybe five years backwards in time somehow. &#039;No Bucks to Give&#039; hadn&#039;t broken out yet. They were still practicing in their parents&#039; barn or something.</p><p class="double">&quot;So I took a train to Seaddle, &#039;cause that&#039;s the core of the barn rock scene, y&#039;know? And I asked around for Cracked Belle, the front mare for the group. Found her place in mid-reheasal. They were a bit rough, but you could tell they were hot, they were going to be on something really huge someday. Well, I could tell, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bartender nodded her head in encouragement.</p><p class="double">&quot;And then when they took a break I said hi, told all about how I&#039;d heard about them through the grapevine. And then I told them about my favorite song. And I borrowed the keyboard and played and sang it for them.&quot;</p><p class="double">It took a lot more booze before the DJ could continue. &quot;I broke Cracked Belle&#039;s heart when I did that. She had just started WRITING that song- it wasn&#039;t finished yet. When I was done, she was in tears. Said she wanted to make music no pony else was making... and if she couldn&#039;t do that, she wouldn&#039;t make music at all.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;No Bucks to Give&#039; broke up that very night. Cracked Belle stayed on the farm making cheese. Nopony ever got to hear any of the hot licks those ponies would have made famous... and it was all my fault.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl&#039;s glass was empty again. This time the bartender, instead of refilling it, took it away from her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Vinyl, dear,&quot; Berry Punch said, &quot;I know just the pony you need to talk to right now. And she&#039;s not Pony Walker&#039;s Black Label.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.14 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Vinyl, this ridiculous façade has gone on long enough!&quot; Octavia tried to pull her hoof out of the unicorn&#039;s magical grip. &quot;You are <i>not</i> helping your case!&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn rolled her eyes. &quot;Just one audience. One. And then if I&#039;m wrong you can do whatever. Hey dudes, code Beeblebrox.&quot; The guards dutifully stood aside. &quot;Heh. Beeblebrox, I haven&#039;t met him yet but he sounds like my kind of two headed alien.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What...?&quot; Octavia pulled free. &quot;Oh. I see. This is some elaborate plan, isn&#039;t it? You pretend to forget our anniversary and then--&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl winced. &quot;Tavi? Just.... just let&#039;s do this.&quot; She entered the throne room, startling a number of petitioners. &quot;OY TIA! CODE BEEBLEBROX!&quot;</p><p class="double">The current speaker looked behind him. &quot;How dare you--!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Relax, Blueblood, this will take less then a minute.&quot; Celestia looked directly at Octavia. &quot;Yes. The loops are a thing. She&#039;s telling the truth. Now then, you were saying?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.15 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;What the <i>why</i>&quot; Twilight asked, scooting off the far side of the bed away from her bunkmate and apparent lover, Vinyl Scratch.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think way back when I said something about the beautiful music you make when you&#039;re in the middle of-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know! I know.&quot; Sometimes Twilight envied the humans their fingers to rub on their faces to show exasperation in such cathartic ways. Hooves just weren&#039;t the same after you&#039;ve tried it with hands.</p><p class="double">The DJ grabbed her shades and music player as she got herself ready for the day- and to beat a hasty exit if need be. &quot;Sorry, still getting used to sorting through loop memories. You wanna just be flatmates or should I ring up Octavia and see if she and her... huh, I think she&#039;s living with Lyra and Bonbon this loop. Anyway, I don&#039;t have to stay if it&#039;d be weird.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed when she realized what the problem was. &quot;No, it&#039;s fine. I&#039;m sorry I reacted like that, it&#039;s just that this is the <i>third</i> loop in a row I&#039;ve Woken Up &#039;attached&#039; romantically, and it gets to be frazzling for someone like me that prefers to stay single. At least <i>you&#039;re</i> Awake...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.16 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Good Morning Professor Dumbledore!&quot; An eleven Year old girl strolled into his office like she owned it. Which she did a few times actually.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, Twilight Sparkle!&quot;, he called genially, &quot;It&#039;s been a while, hasn&#039;t it? The usual?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes please!&quot; Twilight beamed and handed over a thick folder.</p><p class="double">The ancient wizard struck out his hand and whispered &quot;<i>Scholars Touch.</i>&quot; while brushing his hand over the booklet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mh... fourteen parent&#039;s honeymoons, twenty you and your brother, only four Blueblood this time,&quot; he paused &quot;Oh, Vinyl Scratch started looping! I&#039;m looking forward to her work, still listen to some of her old mixes sometimes, please include them next time. Derpy popping like a bubble again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Again?</i>&quot; Twilight looked at him bewildered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, that happened four times already. Each time it was too weird for you.&quot; The old wizard twinkled happily. &quot;So...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook herself out of her stupor. &quot;Oh, of course. Here: Pinkie and Sweetie&#039;s newest creations, just like always.&quot; Twilight handed over a data-chrystal. &quot;Also some of the older stuff in much higher definition. Apple Bloom and Trixie had a loop where they really cranked down on recording equipment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, it&#039;s a pleasure doing business with you, as always.&quot; the old man raised the Elder Wand at the originally Unicorn and incanted:&quot;<i>Obliviate!</i>&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.17 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vinyl was hard at work doing something that those that knew her would swear she had no idea how to do.</p><p class="double">Maintaining a normal sleep schedule.</p><p class="double">For some reason, this loop she played concerts, and was well known across Equestria as having revolutionized classical music, making it popular among the youth once again. She had discovered a few years ago that she had inspired some pony to see if the reverse could work as well.</p><p class="double">Yawning as she woke up, in both meanings, she groaned and pulled the plush covers of her bed over her head as her baseline memories called her a filthy traitor for waking before noon. Her loop memories kept her from going back to sleep though, and a few minutes later she gave up, sliding out of bed, pulling on her slippers and red velvet robe, and heading down the three flights of stairs in her mansion to the kitchen.</p><p class="double">Something seemed off about that, but damn it, she wanted coffee before any serious thinking!</p><p class="double">Filling her mug, she glanced at the cover of the local entertainment section of today&#039;s newspaper on her counter. A picture of a wild party mare with huge shades, a tussled mane, and playing an electric chello to a packed club looked back at her. &quot;DJ Sym4hony, live in concert tonight.&quot; Vinyl muttered to herself as she read the headline. She sighed. &quot;I barely even know her, I think I said hi to her maybe once when we passed each other at the instrument repair place, why does she keep showing up in my loops?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.18 (bobbananaville)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I don’t get you.” ‘Twilight’ glanced up at Rainbow Dash, confused by what the speedster said. “I mean, not you as in Twilight Sparkle, you as in ‘Phantom Looper’. Why do you do that?”</p><p class="double">“Um… Rainbow, what’re you talking about?” The purple unicorn frowned, and Dash could have almost been convinced that she really didn’t comprehend what Dash spoke of but for the nigh-imperceptible widening of her eyes. “I don’t…”</p><p class="double">“You don’t have to keep the act up; I know you’re looping; Twilight’s the anchor, after all. You can go back to acting out her lines all you want later, but please just answer me: why do so many people like to take her place and act exactly as she would? Why do so many loopers like this ghosting thing?” At this point, Rainbow Dash noticed that her tone was becoming more insistent, and tried to tone down a bit. “I mean, y’know, if you’re fine with telling me.”</p><p class="double">‘Twilight Sparkle’ didn’t answer; her eyes were wide, and Rainbow started questioning whether this rendition of Twilight really was native to the loops - there had been quite a few loops wherein the non-looping Twilight existed, though the looping version of her always existed simultaneously. “Maybe I should just go back home and pretend that I didn’t-”</p><p class="double">“No!” The purple unicorn almost shouted. She quieted down before continuing. “No, don’t do that. It’s alright; I’m a ghost looper, yeah.” Rainbow Dash sighed in relief, glad that she hadn’t embarrassed herself by acting insane. “It’s… Well, in my baseline, my life wasn’t particularly great. I was bullied, and when I ended up with friends I still had trouble trusting them. I had trouble trusting anybody, actually.” Her eyes were downcast now.</p><p class="double">“Uh huh. So that’s why you’re acting as a ghost-looper?” Rainbow frowned; there weren’t enough details for her to work up much sympathy, and she didn’t quite get how this could be the reason why this girl - she needed to find out her real name, actually - would give up most, if not all, autonomy in decision making in order to experience Twilight Sparkle’s life.</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah!” The ghost-looper’s looked back up at the pegasus as her frown turned upside down. “Twilight Sparkle was in a position like mine - she wasn’t bullied, mind, but she was isolated and didn’t have much social experience. Unlike me, though, she was given the assignment of learning about friendship. In her place, I’ve the loop just spending time with my - her - friends, putting my life in their hands and vice versa. I stu- <i>she </i>studies friendship like a science and becomes better for it. I thought that if I could experience her life, I could become better too.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash nodded, a smile forming. “Well, I guess that makes sense. Still, if you’ve been Twilight until now, I suppose I haven’t introduced myself to <i>you </i>yet.” She raised her hoof. “My name’s Rainbow Dash, and I can clear the skies in ten seconds flat! And go around the world, but that’s a footnote. You?”</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn hesitated for a second before reciprocating, placing her hoof against Rainbow’s. “Call me Skitter.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.19 (Inadelico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The five that came out of the restaurant came out with smiles on their faces.</p><p class="double">&quot;That food was so good.&quot; Purred Chiyo contentedly, to which Yomi and Osaka beamed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Curry&#039;s cooking may be good, but her singing is terrible.&quot; Commented Tomo, idly.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s that got to do with everything!&quot; cried Yomi.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">While Yomi and Tomo argued, Spike whipped out his clipboard. He made a notation. &quot;Well, that crosses catering off the list. So now we have Sport Shoes for the weather.&quot;</p><p class="double">He looked up at the clouds still filling the sky. &quot;...which doesn&#039;t seem to be done.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! Sport Shoes! My lifelong rival!&quot; Tomo spoke up from her argument with Yomi suddenly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your lifelong rival?&quot; asked Yomi.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, neither of us can compete with Cat Scratch, so who else we are going to be rivals with?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Can&#039;t argue with logic like that.&quot; Snarked Yomi.</p><p class="double">Osaka and Chiyo just nodded their hands in agreement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you know where we can find her?&quot; asked Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, I know where she usually trains.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In a little while they were in a field a bit outside of Ponyville. In the distance, they could see a pony crouched on a cloud. After a second, she took off, speeding into the distance. She came back off after a few minutes, eyeing Tomo warily on approaching.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not going to give me a speeding ticket again, are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Everypony looked at Tomo. &quot;Speeding ticket? Do I want to know?&quot; Asked Yomi.</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably not.&quot; Replied Sport Shoes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, okay then.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike spoke up. &quot;My name is Spike, this is Chiyo. We&#039;re representatives of Princess Celestia checking on the preparations for the Summer Sun celebration.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m Deep Fried.&quot; Osaka gave a little bow.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve met. You&#039;ve lived in Ponyville how long? Anyway, Chiyo doesn&#039;t sound like a pony name.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, there&#039;s a new fad going around. Everypony&#039;s getting human names.&quot; Chiyo replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cool. Whats mine?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo thought for a moment. &quot;How about Kagura?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay. Got it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just like that? You&#039;re going to accept a new name just like that?&quot; asked Tomo incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hush. Look just because you didn&#039;t like yours, doesn&#039;t mean everypony else won&#039;t like them.&quot; Replied Yomi.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mares, the weather?&quot; Spike interrupted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh right. This is no problem. I can clear the sky in 11 seconds, flat.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike suppressed a laugh.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; asked Kagura.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, you just sounded like somepony I know. Anyway, go on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kagura nodded and took to the sky, leaping from cloud to cloud until the sky was clear.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ta da!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo and Osaka stomped their hooves in approval.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, that leaves Cat Scratch with the musical accompaniment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! Cat Scratch! My lifelong rival!&quot; shouted Kagura.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can you show us where she is?&quot; asked Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh sure. I can show you where her cottage is&quot; replied Kagura.</p><p class="double">&quot;This all seems very familiar.&quot; Osaka commented. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.20</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The ruler of Equestria stared down impassively at the earth pony sitting before his throne.</p><p class="double">“My faithful son, you must travel to-”</p><p class="double">There was a pause.</p><p class="double">“To... Ponyville.”</p><p class="double">There was another pause, this time with a slight sound in the middle of it. As though the ruler had almost but not entirely suppressed a snicker.</p><p class="double">“Once there, you must scour the town for your brothers, and form a team capable of defeating your eldest brother when he returns from the moon.”</p><p class="double">Another pause. This time, it was definitely a snigger.</p><p class="double">“As a magical talking pony with wings.”</p><p class="double">The earth pony, a colt of about ten years with a bright yellow coat, sighed. “Look, Dad, if you&#039;re not going to be able to pull this off without laughing, then just go off-script.”</p><p class="double">“Silence! I can do this.” The ruler paused again, then broke down sniggering.</p><p class="double">“You clearly can&#039;t, father.”</p><p class="double">The giggling fit passed, and Emperor Guiding Light schooled his expression into a look of utmost severity. “Now. When your brother returns, employ diverse stratagems in order to cause him to remember his humanity-”</p><p class="double">“Equinity,” the colt stage-whispered, and Guiding Light made a strangled noise.</p><p class="double">“Equinity. Right.” The stern visage trembled, then dissolved into a hysterical laughing fit that had his Imperial Majesty actually falling off the throne, beating his hoof against the steps.</p><p class="double">The colt sighed. “I&#039;ll let you get it out of your system, father. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m <i>certain</i> I can take him.”</p><p class="double">“Be careful, Leman,” the Emperor managed to gasp. “I mean, he might wrong-hoof you! Wrong-hoof!”</p><p class="double">With that, the God-Emperor (usually of Mankind), ruler of the galaxy, and current alicorn, <i>completely</i> lost it.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s an actual expression here,” Lemon Rush muttered, then trotted off.</p><p class="double">He knew the way to Ponyville, and something told him he wouldn&#039;t have much trouble working out which of the ponies of Ponyville were secretly pony-primarchs.</p><p class="double">The fact his own flank bore a symbol of a snarling wolf&#039;s head suggested at least <i>one</i> way to check...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, we&#039;re doomed,” Rush muttered to the guard team he&#039;d picked up along the way.</p><p class="double">Candy Cane nodded morosely. The sight of the Cutie Mark Chaos Gods was yet another sign that this would <i>not</i> be a quiet loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.21 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke mid-step and stumbled as usual. She was human, and wearing a costume of some kind. A quick pulse confirmed that her friends were also awake. They were all seated at a large table in what looked to be a technologically advanced conference room. Seeing only one large throne-like chair open, Twilight sat down.</p><p class="double">Then the memories hit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh!&quot; Twilight summarized, &quot;I don&#039;t think I like this loop all that much.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me neither, sugarcube,&quot; Applejack, aka. &#039;Witheress&#039;, nodded, &quot;The super-villian route just ain&#039;t for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t recognize this loop universe. Any ideas?&quot; Rarity, or &#039;Goop Girl&#039;, said as she rocked back and forth in a large elaborate chair while furtively trying to clean her hands with a rag.</p><p class="double">Twilight pondered, &quot;I think this may be an alternate reality for one of the comic book universes. I&#039;ve certainly never come across anyone with my horrible power. An my codename is awful as well. The Attractor? Just because my only power here is a variation of my &#039;want it, need it&#039; spell, I have to sound like a match making service?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not really excited about my super power thingy, either,&quot; even though her hair was still poofy, Pinkie Pie almost grumbled, &quot;I mean &#039;Blood-Bather&#039;? For real? Sure, I can do the blood-bender thing now, but that doesn&#039;t mean that&#039;s all I&#039;m capable of. Plus, I think this power is kind of yucky and not really fun. How can you even have a fun blood party?&quot;</p><p class="double">A tiny sniffle escaped from Fluttershy, now &#039;NecromanCecelia&#039;, when the animated skeleton of a small rabbit hopped onto the table and tried to comfort her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Rainbow Dash stood up suddenly, &quot;I&#039;m not big on the whole putting people in trances, and that&#039;s pretty much Mesmeria&#039;s only shtick. I say we all go to the beach for the rest of this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded along with all of the others, &quot;Vacation loop it is.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.22 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia, are you feeling alright,&quot; Asked Shining Armor as he stood before the Solar Diarch&#039;s throne in her throneroom. </p><p class="double">The princess gave one of her serene smiles, &quot;Of course! Why do you ask?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s the sun, your highness.&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked out the nearest window to the celestial body, &quot;Looks like it&#039;s burning with the same intensity as before. And it set just fine last evening. What&#039;s the matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining facehooved, &quot;The Sun rose in the south.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia waved him off, &quot;Thought I would try something new.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.23 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie entered Golden Oaks with a slightly bigger smile than normal. It was that time again. &quot;Hey, Twilight! Did you find out something neat lodged in a family tree?&quot; Pinkie loved seeing what her friend&#039;s genealogy research uncovered each Loop. It was like unwrapping a present, only the wrapping paper was history, the present was family, the gift was from a long-forgotten ancestor, and oh dear, Twilight was looking at her expectantly. &quot;Sorry, I got caught up in overextending a metaphor. You were saying?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned a bit and rolled her eyes. &quot;Okay, you know how Mrs. Cake&#039;s great-aunt&#039;s second cousin twice removed was a pegasus?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded. &quot;Of course! If it weren&#039;t for Fairy Cake, little Pound might not have his adorable little wings!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I did my usual digging, and I found that Fairy Cake had a sister this Loop.&quot; Twilight&#039;s smile grew to something Pinkie could be proud of. &quot;A sister named Surprise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Lemme guess, blonde mane, white coat, a certain, familiar cutie mark?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly. And Surprise&#039;s great-granddaughter happened to develop the same mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped at about one-fifth &quot;new pony&quot; intensity. &quot;You mean...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cup Cake is related to you in this Loop, yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie cleared her throat, gave a polite nod, and exited the library. Once she was clear of the branches, she streaked into the sky, exploding in a burst of confetti and exclamations of &quot;The Cake is a Pie! The Cake is a Pie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. &quot;I am so glad SkyNet isn&#039;t here this Loop...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">84.24</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight awoke, and found herself somewhere unfamiliar.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay.

No horn was evident.</p><p class="double"><i>Right. Abilities.</p><p class="double"></i>The diagnostic spell failed. As did the attempt to pull something from her Pocket, and any attempts to use ki, magic, chakra, reiatsu – basically anything.</p><p class="double"><i>Abilities consist in their entirety of the ability to carry a human, the ability to see to both sides of my body at once, and the ability to think.</p><p class="double">Thinking&#039;s good.

Now, what&#039;s the best way to alert a human stable hand to the presence of a sentient pony?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Mornin&#039;, Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight nickered once, then fell silent. Discovering that her name here was the same as her name from home wasn&#039;t unexpected, and she knew all the stable hand was actually doing was letting her know he wasn&#039;t a threat... but it was still encouraging.</p><p class="double">“Lessee, now. We&#039;ve got some corn for you today, Twilight – guess him in charge wants you on top form, for...”</p><p class="double">The stable hand&#039;s voice trailed off, as he finally noticed what was on the back wall of the stall.</p><p class="double">Twilight had spent several hours overnight digging into the wood with her teeth, cursing occasionally behind her eyes, and by now she had the complete alphabet drawn out in two semicircles.</p><p class="double">While he was still staring at the crude letters, she moved her hoof. Near the bottom of the first semicircle – near the top – right at the bottom – right at the bottom – and then&nbsp;&nbsp;just down from the top of the second circle.</p><p class="double">H-E-L-L-O.</p><p class="double">“...well, bugger me...”</p><p class="double">I—W-O-U-L-D—L-I-K-E—S-O-M-E—P-A-P-E-R—A-N-D—A—P-A-I-N-T-B-R-U-S-H—P-L-E-A-S-E.</p><p class="double">By the time Twilight had finished spelling out the message, her foreleg ached. But it certainly had an impact, as the young man went sprinting back towards the main building.</p><p class="double"><i>Contact made. Now let&#039;s see what happens...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Why, this is poppycock!” the psychiatrist said, sighing. “It&#039;s just like that Clever Hans from Germany back in &#039;07. Oh, it&#039;s an impressive feat to train a dumb animal to react properly, but it&#039;s not a thinking horse.”</p><p class="double">The studio audience, and everyone with their televisions turned to BBC2 at home, watched with bated breath as the black-coated mare trotted up to the easel.</p><p class="double">With slow but precise strokes, she began to apply her brush. Occasionally, she dipped the paintbrush back into the paint to refresh it.</p><p class="double">“W-those aren&#039;t words,” the psychiatrist pointed out. “That&#039;s...”</p><p class="double">As he trailed off, the mare paused and winked at him. Then she went back to the easel.</p><p class="double">After five near-silent minutes, there was a credible landscape painting of a wooded stream on the board. It was monochrome, as the mare only had a black pot of paint, but the intent was unmistakeable.</p><p class="double">Underneath, in a surprisingly flowing script, Twilight signed the painting. The caption she added almost as though an afterthought.</p><p class="double"><i>Can&#039;t sing. Can&#039;t dance.

<br /><p><hr></p><p class="double">85.1 (Bigou)</p><p class="double">This loop started exactly like any baseline loop, letting Twilight think it effectively was one. That changed soon after defeating Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">The exact instant princess Celestia landed on the floor of her old castle, Fluttershy became a yellow and pink blur before tackle-hugging the white alicorn, while releasing a deafening cry of &quot;MOM!&quot;</p><p class="double">As soon as this traditional royal Canterlot cry was released, Rarity did the same with her consciousness, Applejack and Rainbow chose to do the same with their lower jaws, letting Pinkie sitting there, muttering something about a &quot;happy family reunion&quot;, her eyes full of joyful tears.</p><p class="double">During all that, the purple anchor looked back and forth between the royal group and the rest of her friends, trying to process what was happening and decide the proper way to react. Eventually, she decided that Rarity was the one who knew how to do so properly: By fainting.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Twilight regained consciousness, she was in her Ponyville bedroom, with a vague memory of a wired dream. Something about Fluttershy being Princess Celestia&#039;s daughter. Her thoughts were answered by a timid but familiar voice. &quot;It wasn&#039;t a dream, Twilight Sparkle. Princess Celestia really IS my mother.&quot; She must have thought that out loud.</p><p class="double">Hearing that, the purple anchor burst out laughing. &quot;Nice one, Fluttershy! You almost got me, there!&quot; But the kind pegasus seemed to be saddened by those words. &quot;It&#039;s not a prank, is it.&quot; Hiding behind her mane, the shy friend shook her head from left to right and back.</p><p class="double">An awkward silence filled the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand if… If you don&#039;t want to be my friend anymore. But please Twilight Sparkle, promise me to never say to anyone else who is my mother.&quot; Finally voiced Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why wouldn&#039;t I be friend with you? Six ponies were needed to defeat Nightmare Moon. Six friends, and you are one of them,&quot; The unicorn assured. &quot;But I admit, I still have a hard time believing you&#039;re related to Princess Celestia. It still look so surreal to me. I mean… Who else have a reality shattering secret? Is Pinkie Pie my long lost imaginary friend?&quot;</p><p class="double">As if on cue, a book unnoticed until then suddenly burst open, liberating confetti, streamers and a certain party pony. Said equine shouting &quot;I AM?!?&quot;, her face full of panic. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.2 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight considered the current variant of Fluttershy to be rather intriguing. She was still a soft-spoken mare who loved all animals, but this Loop her Unawake friend was actually rather proactive about finding good homes for the numerous pet hopefuls that hung around her cottage. And the match-ups were often interesting in and of themselves.</p><p class="double">Honestly, Twilight was rather surprised that it had taken Fluttershy this long to try and match her up. Even more surprising was her choice of pet for Twilight.</p><p class="double">Generally speaking, a rabbit wasn&#039;t her style.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy,&quot; she tried to think of how to gently tell her friend that this wouldn&#039;t work, &quot;I know you mean well, but I&#039;m not really the rabbit type. I&#039;m sure he&#039;s great, and cuddly, and...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked the lapine in the eye. She couldn&#039;t help herself. It was like a mental itch she <i>had</i> to scratch.</p><p class="double">&quot;And adorable! But I have papers to write and studies to...&quot; She looked again. Was it just her or did looking at the rabbit give her ideas? That spot on his left ear generated a desire to look up genetics research and how it translated into pony coat colors this Loop. Why did closely related ponies often have wildly varying colorations? &quot;And why does he seem to be giving me all the inspiration I suddenly have to work on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what he does,&quot; Fluttershy smiled gently. &quot;He&#039;s a plot bunny. His name&#039;s Fluffy.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Of course it is,&#039;</i> Twilight mentally rolled her eyes. <i>&#039;Still, that&#039;s one heck of an ability.

You could probably recite it in your sleep!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not like you!&quot; Nyx wheedled. &quot;I can&#039;t help it if it gets better every time you tell it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You just want to hear me say &#039;Stupid sexy Nightmare Moon&#039; again, don&#039;t you?&quot; Twilight accused her daughter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Only in the proper context!&quot; Nyx clarified happily.</p><p class="double">&quot;.....&quot; Twilight stared at Nyx for a moment. &quot;In anyone ever tries to tell you you&#039;re not my daughter, buck &#039;em in the face.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo walked into the library with a wide grin. &quot;Oh hey, Nyx.

Their house is still standing. They&#039;ll only need two, three months of therapy, tops.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn sighed. &quot;Pansy, did you hold her back at least?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Against my better judgement.</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;...that&#039;s something, at least.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.5 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had just stepped down into Ponyville when she was almost bowled over by a white blur. She spun around, and had just enough time to recognize Angel Bunny before he dashed around a corner. A second later, Rainbow Dash shot past Twilight as well, her wings skimming Twilight&#039;s mane as she too shot around the corner. Twilight stared, looking a bit frazzled, as Fluttershy slowly made her way over.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello Twilight. Sorry about Angel, he and Dash are still finishing their game of tag.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Wha? Wasn&#039;t that several Loops ago? I know they have both Looped since then.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shrugged. &quot;Apparently they were tied at the end of the Loop, and Dash forgot about it because she had that run in with Kirk the next Loop. Angel picked up a new trick in a Fused Loop and brought the game up again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded vaguely as a hole formed itself in the road a short distance away and Angel shot out, twisting between Twilight&#039;s legs to dive into a bush off to the side. Dash then shot past over head, before twisting and diving into a nearby cart.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aha!&quot; Dash shouted before shooting out of the cart and into the sky. &quot;I&#039;ve got the lead!&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel jumped out of the cart (how had he gotten there from the bush?), and tapped his foot on the ground. Another hole opened up and Angel shot into it, before it sealed behind him. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.6 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><i><hr></p><p class="double">Her Majesty</i> Celestia, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith looked down at the head of her Intelligence service this Loop. &quot;M, what <i>has</i> 007 been up to <i>this</i> week?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, he seems to have talked your sister down from her Moon Cult World Domination plan ... in his usual way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Queen Celestia couldn&#039;t decide between an exhausted sigh and a fit of giggles that hadn&#039;t been proper for her since the previous monarch had abdicated. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and so, in conclusion, my client feels that representation in the legal system is a necessity for his people and moral imperative for ponies everywhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked at the brown mare.

But this...</p><p class="double">&quot;I apologize, but I&#039;d just like to clarify. You want me to grant citizenship to rabbits?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare shook her head. &quot;No, your majesty, my <i>client</i> wants you to grant citizenship to <i>bunnies.</i> I personally don&#039;t agree with his views--&quot;</p><p class="double">That earned her a light smack from the rabbit on her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;--but I am obligated, as mayor of Ponyville, to petition for this motion as it has received a three-citizen recommendation and passed two thirds majority vote in the city council.&quot; She pulled a sheaf of paperwork from her saddlebags. &quot;I&#039;ve already assembled a preliminary outline for the legal framework, if you would care to analyze it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia took the papers and flipped through them. &quot;...hmm.

He had awoken in his Darth Vader armor while walking down the shuttle ramp onto the Death Star hanger bay, far too late to save Padme, the Jedi younglings, or the rest he had hunted down. Fortunately, his abilities with the force were useful in stabilizing himself so he did not stumble as he walked. Frankly, he was getting a little tired of baseline loops. Never one for much patience, Anakin wondered how the other anchors dealt with the weight of everything occurring exactly the same, over and over a countless amount of times.</p><p class="double">He was wondering what entertaining changes he could make to this timeline when the first of the glitches started. Lights started flickering, systems went into maintenance loops, droids were acting a bit more erratically, and brief intervals of music was piped through the intercom. Even using the force, Anakin wasn&#039;t able to clearly detect the cause. He did get the vague impression that the force was happily blowing a raspberry at him, but that was a ridiculous concept. Right?</p><p class="double">Definitely not a baseline loop, then. Although he didn&#039;t show it outwardly, Anakin was secretly amused. Despite the glitches, everything else continued as it always did, right up until Tarkin ordered the destruction of Alderaan in front of Leia. He was about to countermand that order as he had done in every loop where he had the power to do so, when a cupcake suddenly flew out of nowhere and hit him in the back of the helmet. He stooped and picked it up off the floor, noticing how it had the words &#039;Let it fire&#039; written on it in frosting. As soon as he held the sugary treat, Anakin was also immersed in the force; enveloped in a sense of giddy serenity and a feeling of everything working out just fine.</p><p class="double">Everyone on the bridge waited to see his reaction, but Darth Vader just stood there in silence, awkwardly holding a dented cupcake.</p><p class="double">Tarkin cleared his throat, &quot;Carry on.&quot;</p><p class="double">The beams were reddish and stuttering as they converged on the output of the main superlaser, which was also reddish in color. Then the blast lashed out at the planet.</p><p class="double">Anakin waited. So did Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia. So did the entire bridge crew of the Death Star.</p><p class="double">The planet floated serenely in space, completely intact.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir!&quot; exclaimed a communication technician, &quot;We&#039;re getting reports from the surface. Apparently, it&#039;s raining down confetti and balloons throughout the planet. And, er, everyone down there is now wearing a silly party hat.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tarkin blinked, &quot;A.. silly party hat?&quot;</p><p class="double">The technician double checked the report, &quot;Yes.. yes, sir.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I know whom we are dealing with,&quot; under his mask, Anakin smiled, thinking, &#039;At least this loop will be anything but boring.&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Was it me!?&quot; a high pitched voice sounded as a girl dropped from the ceiling, did a lazy flip, and landed lightly on her feet. She had curly reddish hair and was wearing something that could only be called a combat cocktail dress, &quot;Was I the one you were thinking of?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie,&quot; Anakin stated and took a step back, trying to remember everything he knew of this particular looper. The force was decidedly strange with her. Instead of feeling direct and straightforward like most Jedi or furtive and greedy like most Sith, Pinkie felt like a mobeus strip stuffed in a klein bottle filled with syrup. Anakin stopped trying to delve deeper when the headache started.</p><p class="double">&quot;Guards!&quot; Was the only thing Tarkin was able to get out before Pinkie waved a hand in his direction.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your arm is now a lollipop!&quot; she chirped.</p><p class="double">And Grand Moff Tarkin, one of the most powerful men in the Empire; dropped his blaster, sat down on the floor, and started licking up and down his forearm while making moaning happy sounds. Anakin put up his hand to halt any other actions by the stormtroopers and other imperials.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re here to save me, Master Jedi?&quot; Leia looked away from her former captor&#039;s disturbing actions and asked with optimism.</p><p class="double">&quot;Silly, I&#039;m a person of impulse and emotion. Just because my personal goals involve making others happy, doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t pursue them with every fiber of my being,&quot; Pinkie Pie giggled, &quot;In other words, who ever said I was a Jedi?&quot;</p><p class="double">She was suddenly holding two activated lightsabers at her sides - both beams were the same color as her hair. Even with his mastery of the force, Anakin didn&#039;t even see her move. Then just to make sure, Pinkie&#039;s wild hair moved on it&#039;s own. A few moments later, her forelock was wrapped around a third ignited lightsaber. There was only one thing Anakin could think of doing now.</p><p class="double">Darth Vader walked up to the small pink haired girl and looked down at her for a moment. Then he knelt, &quot;What is thy bidding, my mistress?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie smiled wider, &quot;Let&#039;s get my new Party Star moving! We have a whole galaxy to cheer up with my super duper party cannon and time&#039;s a wasting!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.9(TheCentauress)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke surprisingly comfortably in a human form, sitting in a familiar seat.</p><p class="double">Well, familiar, as in she had seen in before.</p><p class="double">The main seat of the Starship Enterprise, NCC-1701, the Original.</p><p class="double">The surroundings, however.... they had seen better days. Much better days. The lighting was dim an flickering, where the alert panels we not illuminating; the consoles looked like someone had loosed Discord on them, telling him they held his presents.</p><p class="double">And the display screen in front of her... holy ironwood! ... displayed an image that would scar her memories, <u><i><b>FOREVER....</b></i></u> A human Pinkie Pie, arming a Genesis Party Device...</p><p class="double">As reality went Neon Rave, she seriously wondered if anyone <u>could</u> stop the Celebration Arms Race... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.10&nbsp;&nbsp;(Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;As usual did Twilight Sparkle wake</p><p>On riverbank, with ancient open tome.</p><p>This time a baseline path she chose to take</p><p>And settle in her familiar home.</p><p>The Purple Smart fled swift to turret dome</p><p>And sought her stalwart friends by Looper Ping.</p><p>The swift reply of Loyal Polychrome,</p><p>The Mare Profound of Thought and Swift of Wing,</p><p>Whose awesome deeds resound amongst each living thing...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Laying it on a bit thick there, aren&#039;t you Dash?&quot;</p><p class="double">The blue pegasus harrumphed and replied:</p><p class="double">&quot;There once was a mare with unusual curse:</p><p>She&#039;d make every statement in verse.</p><p>&#039;Cause her friends, they did choose</p><p>A learning foible to abuse.</p><p>I can&#039;t see how her day can go worse!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked. &quot;I&#039;m not the one who tried to trip Zecora up with &#039;silver&#039; and &#039;orange.&#039; I think it shows a bit of class on her part that you have to use poetic forms and not just doggerel.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash grumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m thankful haiku</p><p>Doesn&#039;t necessarily</p><p>Have to be rhyméd.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.11 (Daniel H)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was the day before the thousandth Summer Sun Celebration, and Spike and Twilight were going over the standard checklist. As was traditional for times when they were both Awake and the other baseline Element bearers weren&#039;t, they discussed their recent separate Loops in between meeting their friends. Twilight finished telling Spike about the difficulties the new Loopers seemed to be facing (Vinyl had experienced yet another &quot;first Loop&quot;; Derpy had regained another set of unAwake memories and asked if she could fly in the Equestria Games qualifying round again) on the way to check on the decorations, so when the meeting with Rarity was done, Spike started telling the stories of some of his recent Fused Loops where Twilight hadn&#039;t been present.</p><p class="double">Any Looper can speak practically any language found in any world if they&#039;ve gone through enough Loops. Some of them, such as English and Japanese, can usually be learned within a handful of Fused Loops; others, like Klingon, are a bit rarer. On the whole, though, if you meet a Looper who&#039;s able to store anything larger than a language textbook in their subspace pocket, chances are they don&#039;t actually need that textbook. In this case, Spike was telling Twilight about a recent Middle Earth Loop, and it was natural to use mostly Westron with the occasional sentence in one of the other Mannish or Elvish languages.</p><p class="double">It came as a bit of a surprise, therefore, when a voice suddenly sounded out &quot;Are you a baby dragon?! I&#039;ve never seen a baby dragon before! Is this Smaug you were talking about also a dragon?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apparently, baseline Fluttershy&#039;s ability to understand all sorts of creatures extended to those who were speaking languages which didn&#039;t even exist in Equestria. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.12 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><b><hr></p><p class="double">Heartstring&#039;s Eleven</b></p><p>It was another variant loop, this time located in Las Pegasus. Things were vastly different here, but it was definitely Equestria. Some differences included it was always night time, the Lunar Solstice had replaced the Summer Sun Celebration and Rarity was part of the Canterlot elite. Nightmare Moon herself was something different almost altogether. Even though her night has lasted for a thousand years, she had taken steps to preserve Equestria, such as controlling the heating and cooling of the two sides of the planet and magically imbued plants with the ability to grow in moonlight. </p><p class="double">Twilight was letting Lyra run the show this time to ease her into these odder loop variations. Besides, Lyra was the one who approached Twilight with a plan to save Equestria and Twilight thought her plan was interesting. Eleven loopers including Lyra and Twilight total had gathered in Rarity&#039;s private mansion on the edge of the city, all in various states of resting positions around the pool and lawn. Lyra and Twilight approached the group, calling them all to attention. Lyra greeted everyone, &quot;Mares, welcome to Las Pegasus. Before we get started, what we&#039;re about to do is highly dangerous, but something new we haven&#039;t done before. If you already have plans for this loop, help yourself to whatever food,&quot; pointing to the apple fritters, daisy sandwiches and countless confections provided by Pinkie&#039;s poolside party, &quot;you like and please go enjoy the loop to your hearts&#039; content. Otherwise, come with us.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two mares did a 180 and went into the mansion. The gathered loopers rose slowly and trotted into the building. Once inside, Lyra called on her magic, activating a projector screen, &quot;Ponies, I give you the 3000 block of Las Pegasus Boulevard, otherwise known as the Ponyville, the Mirage and the NMM Grand. Together, they are the three most profitable casinos in Las Pegasus, but also known to house the Elements of Harmony.&quot;</p><p class="double">The screen shifted to that of six stone orbs in circular pattern surrounding a tarp covered pony sized object in the center of the room. Lyra trotted from left to right, &quot;This is the vault at the Ponyville, located below the strip, beneath 200 feet of solid earth. It is where the elements of Harmony have been housed for this loop. And we&#039;re going to rob it.&quot;</p><p class="double">She paused for a second, &quot;Ok, this loop is mostly bad news, the casino houses a security system that rivals most hub world&#039;s nuclear missile silos-&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash waved nonchalantly, &quot;Big deal, just have Twilight teleport inside and steal the elements as always...in fact I&#039;ll just summon mine.&quot;</p><p class="double">She concentrated for a second as an Element of Loyalty materialized around her neck. Twilight gave her a scathing look, &quot;Dash!&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash looked at Twilight who gestured at Lyra. The musical pony and part time thief was looking down at the floor, with a mournful expression on her face. Dash rubbed the back of her mane, &quot;Uh, actually this would be a bit too easy. Need to challenge myself, so what&#039;s the plan Lyra?&quot;</p><p class="double">She brightened up almost immediately as Dash sent her element away. Chrysalis, resting against Trixie, raised her hoof, &quot;Quick question, why is Nightmare Moon running a casino in Las Pegasus anyway? For that matter, why Las Pegasus?&quot; </p><p class="double">Lyra flinched a bit, then shifted the slide back to the vault, &quot;See that tarp covered object in the center of the room? It&#039;s not covering money or jewels, it&#039;s housing the sleeping form of Celestia, sealed in stone. Every year, she likes to gloat over her victory on the night of the Lunar Solstice, AKA the Summer Sun Celebration and put Celestia on display for 24 hours under close guard. Every year, it&#039;s in Las Pegasus since it was the site of Celestia&#039;s defeat. As for a casino, Twilight and I think she does it for fun. Beyond that, it&#039;s anyone&#039;s guess.&quot;</p><p class="double">Another image of the casino floor replaced the vault, &quot;First, we have to get within the casino cages which takes more than a smile, sorry Fluttershy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy seemed a bit abashed as Lyra continued, &quot;Next, through a set of doors requiring a six-digit code which is changed every day. After that comes the elevator, which won&#039;t move without authorized hoofprint identification-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, &quot;Which we can&#039;t fake, not even with a Changeling&#039;s disguise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra nodded, &quot;And voice print identification from both the security system within the Ponyville and the vault below-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which we won&#039;t get.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra continued, &quot;Furthermore, the elevator shaft is lined with thaumatic detection sensors as well as motion sensors linked to an anti-magic field generator within the elevator itself as well as automatic brakes and door locks.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight explained, &quot;Meaning if we tried forcing the elevator to the bottom by magic, physical force or computer override, the elevator will be locked down automatically, and we&#039;d be trapped within.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Once we get down the shaft though, It&#039;s easy. Just have to slip by two golem sentries whose destruction will result in the Vault going boom, several more anti-magic field generators located within the hallway walls, and the most elaborate vault ever conceived by ponykind. Any questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda raised her talons, &quot;Why don&#039;t we just smash through the vault and fly them out that way? Or tunnel under the vault?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed again, &quot;The vault is rigged with explosives to destroy the elements, followed by an incinerator to melt the dust remaining into glass by either remote activation or when the Gollems are destroyed. If it appears someone will succeed stealing the elements and Celestia, the vault is detonated immediately. We can&#039;t tunnel, since she has motion sensors that can detect the earth shifting from 100 yards. If Angel Bunny were to build a home under the casino, Nightmare would know.&quot;</p><p class="double">A blue pony raised her hand, &quot;Trixie has a question. Say we get into the cage and past the security doors. Then, down the elevator we can&#039;t move, past the guards we can&#039;t destroy and past the vault we can&#039;t open-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked and added quickly, &quot;Without being seen by the security cameras.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra rubbed the back of her mane, &quot;Oh yeah, the entire casino is rigged with cameras covering every nook and cranny of the building with special attention paid to watching the vault hallway and vault very closely. Every camera can also see through the use of magic so illusions won&#039;t do us too much good.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded, &quot;Yes, say we get past all that. We&#039;re supposed to just walk out of there with Statue Celestia and the Elements completely unopposed?&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a moment&#039;s pause before Lyra spoke with complete confidence, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">The magician grinned. &quot;Trixie likes this plan. When do we begin?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.13 (Hubris Plus, DrTempo &amp; yannoshka)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer stumbled as she Awoke mid-step, distantly wondering where she&#039;d ended up this time. She&#039;d been to so many worlds, lived so many lives, and, though she wouldn&#039;t trade away the friends she&#039;d made for anything, she was beginning to grow homesick. It had gotten to the point that she&#039;d grown more used to walking on two legs than four and she wasn&#039;t certain she&#039;d be able to recognize her own face in the mirror.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, first things first,&quot; she muttered, shifting her weight from foot to foot. Examining a new body was a habit she&#039;d picked up all the way back in Kingdom Hearts, where her form was liable to change any time she set foot on a new world. &quot;Biped, feels female. Oh, fingers, fingers are good,&quot; she added, waggling her digits. She&#039;d quite gotten to like fingers over the course of her adventures.</p><p class="double">She paused as she caught sight of her reflection in a pane of glass, turning to examine herself in full.</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Unusual pigmentation,&quot; she continued with growing excitement as she saw the pale orange of her skin, raising a hand to double check that it wasn&#039;t a trick of the light. &quot;And the hair!&quot; She enthused as she tugged a lock of bright red hair streaked with yellow into her line of sight. Finally, she caught sight of the trophies on the other side of the glass.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Canterlot High Gymnastics Team</p><p></i>, she read.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>I&#039;m home!</i>&quot; She shouted, pumping both fists into the air, only to realize that the hum of conversation around her had cut out entirely. Turning slowly, she found the entire student body staring at her incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope,&quot; she declared. &quot;Still happy. I&#039;m home!&quot; She said again, tugging the nearest teen into a hug.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eep!&quot; Fluttershy squeaked, &quot;that&#039;s, um, nice?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Yes it is,&quot; Sunset answered, releasing the trembling girl. &quot;I&#039;ll explain everything later,&quot; she went on, manifesting her Keyblade. &quot;For now I have a friend to meet, a planet to save, and amends to make!&quot;</p><p class="double">Running out into the courtyard, she levelled the blade at the portal at the base of the statue, and twisted. With a <i>click</i> that thrummed through the very fabric of reality, the gate to Equestria was opened and she darted through. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, as was usual for the baseline Loops, was facing Nightmare Moon. She was intending to more or less handle things as per usual. She&#039;d checked, and was the only one Awake. As Nightmare Moon finished her usual speech, a cloaked figure(Twilight noticed the cloak looked like those the group known as Organization XIII wore in the Kingdom Hearts Loops) slammed into the corrupted alicorn, and then opened a portal, tossing Nightmare Moon in, jumping through after that. Twilight was confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;What the....&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a few minutes, and sensed where the strange figure had taken Nightmare Moon. Quickly hiding somewhere, she entered alicorn form, and teleported to where she&#039;d sensed the corrupted Luna. She found herself in the middle of nowhere..somewhere near where the Diamond Dogs lived, if she recalled correctly. As Twilight arrived, the cloaked figure summoned what she knew to be a Keyblade. The guard looked like a sun setting in the distance, while the blade itself looked like a Keyblade usually did. The teeth and keychain had the exact same look...</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer&#039;s cutie mark. &quot;Sunset? Is that..&quot; </p><p class="double">The cloaked figure removed her hood, revealing the face of a pony she never expected to see. She smiled, and said a phrase Twilight remembered from so long ago.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have been, and always shall be, your friend. And I did enjoy seeing those last moments together.&quot; Twilight was in tears. She never imagined this moment&#039;d come...That Shimmer would ever truly Awaken. </p><p class="double">Sunset then yelled, &quot;Now go..Get the Elements of Harmony. I&#039;ll keep her busy! MOVE IT!&quot; Twilight nodded, and quickly teleported off. </p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon looked at Sunset Shimmer, and asked, &quot;Who are you to stand in my way?&quot; Growling, Sunset Shimmer said, &quot;I am the morning sun, and I have come to vanquish this horrible night!&quot; Nightmare Moon, in response, laughed manically. &quot;Please..like YOU could stop me with that silly sword!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shimmer smirked. &quot;You know, I was like you in a way once. I craved power. I wanted to be like Celestia..become a Princess. Now... I know I don&#039;t deserve that sort of power. I didn&#039;t even have an idea on what I&#039;d do after I became a Princess! I&#039;d thought I was being held unfairly from power I thought I deserved. Man, was I such a foalish mare!&quot; </p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon said, &quot;And your point?&quot; </p><p class="double">Sunset raised a hoof, as if to tell Nightmare Moon to be quiet, replying, &quot;I was getting to it. As I read once, &#039;With great power comes great responsibility.&#039; I wasn&#039;t responsible enough to handle that kind of power.&quot; Sunset frowned. &quot;Look at you...You got jealous of your sister, and instead of talking it out, you went insane! Sisters aren&#039;t like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">The corrupted alicorn laughed. &quot;Like she&#039;d listen.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset shook her head. &quot;I can&#039;t believe I was like you once.&quot; </p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon chuckled manically in response. &quot;And you think a mere unicorn can stop me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset focused a spell, and took on a humanoid form, much like the one she usually had in the world beyond the mirror. &quot;I am not an ordinary unicorn. I am Keyblade Master Sunset Shimmer. And I&#039;m the one who will show you the light!&quot; Taking up a stance, she smirked. </p><p class="double">&quot;OK.... LET&#039;S DANCE!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two charged at each other, and the fight began in earnest.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight teleported her fellow Element bearers back to where she&#039;d left Sunset Shimmer, now equipped with the Elements of Harmony. </p><p class="double">As she saw Sunset Shimmer fight, she had to admit; she was impressed. She noticed moves she&#039;d seen from many a Looper. She also could turn her Keyblade into various forms, like a whip, gauntlets, and other forms; Shimmer&#039;s style seemed very adaptable. Twilight noticed that it didn&#039;t seem as if Shimmer had truly mastered one kind of fighting style, like the other Loopers had over the Loops. She seemed to prefer anything that worked, but she did seem more comfortable with using her Keyblade, though.</p><p class="double">&quot;AND STAY DOWN!&quot; Sunset landed a powerful blast of light on Nightmare Moon, who looked dazed. Seeing Twilight nearby, Sunset yelled, &quot;DO IT! Free Luna from this madness!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and the Elements&#039; power awakened...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset and Twilight hugged; the former was back in her unicorn form, and the two had just talked to Celestia, where Sunset humbly apologized for her sins.</p><p class="double">Twilight quickly asked, &quot;How did you get past the mirror?&quot; </p><p class="double">Sunset chuckled, like the question was as easy to answer as two plus two. &quot;I used my Keyblade on the mirror; it opened the portal up early. When I came through, I kinda realized Nightmare Moon&#039;d arrived, and I knew what I had to do.&quot; Twilight&#039;s next question was the obvious one.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where did you learn all of that stuff you used?&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been in a LOT of Fused Loops.And I mean a LOT. A few dozen, at LEAST...met each of the original Loopers too. My third Loop was a Kingdom Hearts Fused Loop, with me in Riku&#039;s place.&quot; Twilight grimaced. She&#039;d heard what&#039;d happened to Riku in baseline..that&#039;d definitely humble Sunset. </p><p class="double">Sunset continued, &quot;It was my third Loop, actually....Can&#039;t remember if the Loop where you told me about the Loops happened first, or the one where I acted like the first time you went through the mirror did. My memory was so jumbled, I thought the memories of who I was in that first Fused Loop were the real thing, and everything else...Simple dreams.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, who gave you the speech about the Multiverse? Sora?&quot; </p><p class="double">Sunset shook her head. &quot;Nope. Mickey did..right after Castle Oblivion.&quot; She removed a book from her subspace pocket. &quot;Here..a journal of all I&#039;ve been through. I&#039;m finally home....&quot; Sunset sniffed, and then said, &quot;Let&#039;s go meet your friends, OK?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled, glad a friend she thought she&#039;d never see was back. &quot;Yeah..Let&#039;s go.&quot;</p><p class="double">At last, Sunset Shimmer was home. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.14 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The four Crusaders woke up in a lecture hall, all of them robe wearing unicorns. Applebloom wore a green robe, Scootaloo wore blue, Sweetie Belle wore white, and Nyx wore purple. Standing behind the teacher&#039;s desk, a similarly robe wearing Twilight Sparkle was speaking to them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good morning.&quot; She greeted them. &quot;I am the senior tutor of the University, Twilight Sparkle, and I am not an alicorn.&quot; Following that oddly specific denial, she continued. &quot;You have been chosen to travel to Canterlot, and aid The Princess in the defense of the great capital city.</p><p class="double">So, a quick briefing before you go:</p><p>Luna is gone.</p><p>Monsters roaming the lands.</p><p>The Princess in need of your aid!</p><p>I am Twilight Sparkle, not an alicorn.</p><p>You must go to Canterlot.</p><p class="double">Class dismissed. Have fun saving the kingdom!&quot; She waved at them, prior to teleporting away.</p><p class="double">The sudden silence that followed was broken by Sweetie Belle. &quot;Please tell me you&#039;re all Awake?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup.&quot; Applebloom replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why do I feel oddly desensitized to death? Scootaloo chimed in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe because our loop memories tell us Trixie would be a paragon of safety around these parts?&quot; Nyx let her head fall to her desk. &quot;Oh cypress, and Mom isn&#039;t Awake yet either.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After pulling themselves together, they went down to join their &quot;Saving the World&quot; party, already in progress. The mage that greeted them, Shamrock according to their loop memories, had just finished telling them about a tragic cheese shortage, when somepony else walked up, said... something, and the floor underneath them exploded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you alright down there?&quot; Shamrock peered down on them. &quot;You just try and find your way out of the dungeon, while we board this up.&quot; As soon as he finished saying that, planks started being laid across the hole.</p><p class="double">As Shamrock finished saying something about bananas, the light from above shut off completely. As their eyes adjusted to the gloom and torchlight, they noticed a convenient rack of staves and swords.</p><p class="double">&quot;Convenient rack of weapons, and what looks like a tutorial dungeon.&quot; Nyx nodded to herself. &quot;It&#039;s official girls, we&#039;re in a game-loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A quick teleport and a few flights of stairs later, the Crusaders decided to forego the party, and simply get underway. Taking their farewell gift of some spells, the four trekked onward.</p><p class="double">Aside from the old mage examining a dead moose, and swiftly clearing out a rat infestation in some farmer&#039;s celler, it was oddly quiet. They were beginning to think they&#039;d missed something at the party, or maybe left too soon, when goblins attacked.</p><p class="double">When negotiations broke down, which was an impressive eight seconds in, the four of them took a brief huddle in the middle of a shield spell. After concluding their discussion, they came out, spells flying.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo ran up to her friends, after the troll that had killed the guard captain finally went down. &quot;Ohmygosh, is Nyx okay? I saw she was on fire, then she went in front of my beam, and vanished! Is she okay?!&quot;</p><p class="double">The other two Crusaders didn&#039;t say anything, Applebloom pointing at the red streak on the ground, while Sweetie Belle seemed to be in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Oh... Twilight&#039;s gonna kill me.&quot; Scootaloo held her head in her hooves. &quot;Then she&#039;s gonna wait for the loop to reset, and kill me again. Then Nyx is gonna kill me. My seemingly infinite life is over for the short term.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey now, Nyx voted for playing the game too. We could have gone past this, but she wanted to give the loop a try, just like we did.&quot; Applebloom turned to the remaining Crusader. &quot;Back me up here, Sweetie? Um, Sweetie Belle? You okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle hadn&#039;t moved her eyes away from Nyx&#039;s... sorta-corpse. Shakily lifting her staff in her magic, she began to cast a spell they&#039;d been given before leaving the University.</p><p class="double">&quot;L-Life. Lightning.&quot; With a splat, the end of her staff landed in the smear, green and purple orbs orbiting the end as she cast, &quot;Revive!&quot;</p><p class="double">The sun seemed to shine a bit brighter through the trees, the wind picked up, and the world seemed to fall silent, as they all held their breaths. Their friend however, did not revive.</p><p class="double">Putting a hoof on her shoulder, Applebloom tried to console Sweetie Belle. &quot;You tried, Sweetie, but we might just have to accept Nyx is gonna get back-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t feel so good.&quot; A voice behind them interrupted her. Turning, they saw Nyx, alive and well, complete with an intact purple robe. Also, oddly enough, a new staff and sword, in spite of her previous set still being on the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re okay!&quot; Scootaloo hit Nyx in a tackle-hug. &quot;The spell worked! You&#039;re okay! My life isn&#039;t over!&quot; She continued to gush as she held her friend.</p><p class="double">Well, her friend&#039;s body, at any rate. Unfortunately for both ponies involved, a tackle-hug inflicts a single point of damage, and fresh from being revived, Nyx only had one hit point.</p><p class="double">Another panic attack, and revive spell, later, and the four of them akwardly stood over a dead Nyx. The living Nyx also came with an untarnished robe, and new staff and sword.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo once again broke the silence. &quot;So... can we <i>not</i> tell Twilight about how I killed her daughter? Twice? In a ten minute time period?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>And so, our young and bold wizards set forth on their quest. Guiding them through the perils of the world was the charmingly beautiful Twilight Sparkle, who is by no means an alicorn! As they approached the Everfree Forest, it became clear there was evil afoot.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">85.13 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So... where did you go?” Twilight asked. “I mean, you said you had a lot of fused loops...”</p><p class="double">Sunset nodded. “I feel like I&#039;ve been... well, everywhere. I almost certainly haven&#039;t, but...” She broke off, and pointed to the book lying on the table. “I kept a journal. Remember? Maybe... maybe it&#039;d be better if you read it first.”</p><p class="double">Twilight twitched, as though she&#039;d started to move but thought better of it. “May I?”</p><p class="double">“Of course.” Sunset nodded, as Twilight picked it up. “That&#039;s why I kept it, really. Oh, I might have got the numbering confused a few times. Sorry...”</p><p class="double">“You don&#039;t need to apologize for that,” Twilight replied. “I&#039;ve lost count of how many loops I&#039;ve done.”</p><p class="double">She cracked the cover of the book, and began to read.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">Entry 1:</p><p class="double">My name is....Houka..or is it Sunset Shimmer?....</p><p class="double">I remember being born here on Destiny Islands...but also remember being born in a world called Equestria. I remember both talking to a friend named Twilight Sparkle who told me time was looping endlessly, and trying to kill her. </p><p class="double">Both seem like a dream now....Anyhow, today, we&#039;re building a raft to see the outside world...I can&#039;t wait.</p><p class="double">Entry 2:</p><p class="double">Ever since that day the islands were consumed by darkness, I&#039;ve been through a lot. First, I found myself in another world; something I&#039;d always wanted to see since I was young....I then met a woman named Maleficent. She seemed arrogant..like I was in those dreams.</p><p class="double">But said she&#039;d help give me strength to help my best girl friend, Kairi...OK, I had a crush on Sora...But I knew he loved Kairi. </p><p class="double">Maybe out of jealousy, or wanting to do something to help, I let Maleficent teach me a few things. I didn&#039;t like her..with a name like THAT, come on, who WOULD trust her? But I had no choice at the time. When I saw Sora again, he had a weapon called a &quot;Keyblade.&quot; I was curious about it, and when I had it in my hand, it felt like a part of me. </p><p class="double">Maleficent tried to tell me that Sora&#039;d abandoned me, but I knew better. Friends never do that. Still, her gift to control the Heartless-beings of pure darkness-was tempting, but I knew I had to be strong on my own merits. I did in, the end, take the gift, but only to use as a last resort in case I was surrounded.</p><p class="double">Then &quot;Ansem&quot;, a massively powerful Heartless, possessed me after Sora reclaimed the Keyblade after I somehow claimed it, despite my efforts at not becoming his new body...I still feel used. </p><p class="double">After &quot;Ansem&quot; was stopped, as I journeyed through a place called Castle Oblivion to face my darkness by going through my memories, I found myself in a world similar to my dreams of Equestria and Canterlot High. I don&#039;t understand why I experienced what I&#039;m sure were dreams at the time, but I went on my journey, nevertheless.</p><p class="double">I faced my darkness and accepted it as a part of me, and faced &quot;Ansem&quot; again, and defeated him. Now I await for Sora to awaken as his memories are put back together again...</p><p class="double">Entry 3:</p><p class="double">Yesterday Mickey, a friend I&#039;d made asked me what was wrong, when he saw something was on my mind. I told him about the dreams I had, and the odd world I&#039;d seen in Castle Oblivion.</p><p class="double">His response shocked me. </p><p class="double">&quot;So, you&#039;re Looping too, huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">It was then I learned what the &quot;dreams&quot; I&#039;d had were; memories. They were the real thing: I WAS Sunset Shimmer. That was who I truly was. It explained why my &quot;Dark Mode&quot;, the form I&#039;d taken when I harnessed my darkness in my heart to its full power, looked the way it did..it was the form I&#039;d taken when I&#039;d put on the crown that fateful night. Apparently, I&#039;d just begun to experience these Loops, and me having what&#039;s called a &quot;Fused Loop&quot; so early on threw my memories off so badly, I couldn&#039;t tell the difference in my memories.</p><p class="double">And it also explained the odd looks Sora&#039;d given me at first..he was &quot;Looping&quot; as well; in fact he was the &quot;Anchor&quot; for this particular part of the multiverse. Mickey was an Anchor for the &quot;Disney&quot; Loops in general, which were seperate from the Kingdom Hearts Loops(though they did share many similar inhabitants) I was gonna get Sora back for not saying anything when I saw him again. But for now, I need to make sure that meeting does happen.</p><p class="double">Entry 4:</p><p class="double">I&#039;ve had to go through a lot, even having to look like &quot;Ansem&quot; when I had to stop Roxas, who had been created when Sora had to free Kairi&#039;s heart, so Sora could wake up from his sleep. But when we did meet again, I did give Sora a good talking to. He apologized for it, saying he wasn&#039;t sure where I was from and smiled at me, as he always did...Curse that smile of his. </p><p class="double">After that, the whole &quot;Mark Of Mastery Exam&quot; business occured, to be sure we&#039;d be ready for Xehanort, the one responsible for all that had occured, when he returned...Sora&#039;s gotten used to the darkness by now, so he didn&#039;t end up suffering what Mickey told me he did in the baseline. Even I hadn&#039;t gone that far back when I was still a jerk. I&#039;d never literally shatter someone&#039;s heart like that.</p><p class="double">The Xehadorks&#039; faces when Sora leapt up from his seat during our encounter with the True Organization XIII, the group made of Xehanort&#039;s other selves, was PRICELESS. They did not expect their little vessel to have gotten past what they&#039;d done to him.</p><p class="double">After that, Sora said the Loop usually ended here, but told me that we would meet again someday, and as I held my Keyblade, Shimmering Sunset, in my hand, I smiled.</p><p class="double">Sora is a true friend, indeed...</p><p class="double">Entry 5:</p><p class="double">I Awoke in a bed I didn&#039;t recognize. Shouldn&#039;t I be home? I frowned, remembering what I&#039;d been through with Sora and Mickey, and what my Keyblade felt like to give me hope...</p><p class="double">And then a flash of light, and my Keyblade appeared. How? Then I remembered Mickey saying some things carried over between Loops...Guess this had, as well...</p><p class="double">When I see you again, Twilight, I&#039;ll definitely have some questions for you. But for now, I have to find out where I am. </p><p class="double">Someday, I&#039;ll be home again, and then, Twilight..I hope you forgive this fool. </p><p class="double"><u>Keychain: Glimmering Sunset</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></u><hr></p><p class="double">85.15 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Okay.&quot; Twilight rubbed her head, looking at the assembled ponies (and one admin) as she clutched her mug. &quot;Okay, okay okay.

You should be on the other side of the mirror!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... there&#039;s something else.&quot; Sunset Shimmer rubbed her hooves together awkwardly. &quot;See, back when I was talking to Fluttershy for my... loop therapy, we kind of realized... apparently... weeeeeeeeell, I&#039;m kind of shapeshifted.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;But... what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, for some reason I&#039;m consistently &#039;cursed&#039; to be a unicorn, and removing that curse gets you a teenage human girl.&quot; She smiled shyly. &quot;Great leather coat, though...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right.

We limited to production models only?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, just so long as it was possible with the tech of the time.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara coughed. “Silbervogel!”</p><p class="double">“Ah said <i>possible.</i> That thing weren&#039;t – woulda melted.”</p><p class="double">“I assume I&#039;m to check that the rules are followed?” Nyx asked.</p><p class="double">“If y&#039;all don&#039;t mind.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, let&#039;s be honest,” Applebloom said, as her blackened 16-inch guns returned to their rest positions. “You were <i>really</i> askin&#039; for it using a ship based on <i>Warspite</i>, Silver.”</p><p class="double">“It seemed funny at the time,” Silver admitted. “Less funny now.”</p><p class="double">“A ship <i>that</i> unlucky?” Applebloom shook her head. “Only <i>Warspite</i> could hit an uncharted rock in the middle of the Griffin Ocean.”</p><p class="double">Silver&#039;s reply was cut off as the magazine exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“In all honesty, you probably weren&#039;t going to win that one anyway,” Nyx said, as Silver tugged her teleport harness off.</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah...” Silver sighed. “I&#039;d thought the Unrotated Projectiles I added might have helped, though. Hey, what did the others go with?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Sweetie and Diamond are getting pretty close...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Stay <i>still!</i>” Sweetie hissed, as Diamond&#039;s ridiculously fast ship did another supple turn, dodging adroitly into the gap between two of her torpedo salvo, and settled down onto a course directly for her.</p><p class="double">“Like it?” Diamond asked, over the radio link. “It&#039;s a <i>Shimikaze.</i> I thought, I like destroyers, so why not just use a ship which is like four of them at once?”</p><p class="double">The hydrophones on Sweetie&#039;s Type XXI U-boat reported a loud series of splashes.</p><p class="double">“What was that?” she asked. “Sounded like torpedoes to me...”</p><p class="double">Diamond&#039;s ship was already going evasive. “It was. Ten Long Lances.”</p><p class="double">“TEN?” Sweetie spluttered.</p><p class="double">“Indeed. I thought I&#039;d keep five tubes loaded just in case.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie&#039;s hoof was already jammed onto the <i>dive</i> switch. Sadly, the Type XXI was not particularly good at crash-dives.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, that <i>can&#039;t</i> be legal!” Sweetie insisted. “<i>Fifteen</i> Long Lance torpedos?”</p><p class="double">Nyx held up a data sheet.</p><p class="double">“...huh. They really did build one.” Sweetie scanned it. “HIJMS<i> </i>Shimikaze. That is a ludicrous top speed.”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Silver grinned. “I think &#039;Bloom&#039;s gonna get her comeuppance. Iowas are good, but nowhere near <i>that</i> good.”</p><p class="double">“Can Scoots stop her?” Sweetie asked.</p><p class="double">Nyx passed over another data sheet.</p><p class="double">“Oh, what the hay. How did she...”</p><p class="double">“I suspect weather magic was involved,” Nyx said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Now, see here, I have something of a dilemma,” Diamond said down the radio link. “I&#039;ve got twenty-five torps left. So, how many do I use on you?”</p><p class="double">“None, &#039;cause ah&#039;ll blow y&#039;all out of the water first,” Applebloom replied lightly. “Hey, stand still for a minute.”</p><p class="double">Diamond replied by going to full throttle – a blisteringly fast 39 knots. “Nah. Right, let&#039;s go with a full tube strike. Scoots will have to make do with ten.”</p><p class="double">As the two ships jostled for position for when Diamond began her run in, something appeared on the horizon.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...well, I didn&#039;t expect that,” Diamond noted, as the <i>Iowa</i> class battleship she&#039;d been contemplating attacking finally exploded under the pounding of a second Bouncing Bomb wave.</p><p class="double">“Scootaloo, how the fern did you get <i>Lancasters</i> out here?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;d be telling,” Scootaloo replied cheekily. “Now, &#039;scuse me, I need to spot another strike.”</p><p class="double">“Not if I catch you first,” Diamond promised, turning to face the direction the Lancs had come from. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That is the most ridiculous thing I have <i>ever</i> seen,” Diamond said in tones of hushed awe.</p><p class="double">The aircraft carrier she was closing in on – <i>very</i> quickly – was utterly enormous. Almost half a mile long, nearly four hundred feet across the beam, and far taller than her own diminutive super-destroyer.</p><p class="double">Also, it was made almost entirely out of ice.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know.” Scootaloo admitted. “But it&#039;s still awesome. I&#039;ll be with you in just a few minutes, I&#039;m nearly finished spotting my deck strike. How do eighty Mosquitos sound?”</p><p class="double">“Like something that&#039;ll never get launched,” Diamond replied. Curving <i>Shimikaze</i> out in a long, looping arc, she bored in towards the side of the... well, the <i>iceberg...</i> and launched a full spread of fifteen torpedoes.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“At last!” Scootaloo cheered. “I won for once!”</p><p class="double">“Still not sure <i>how</i> you survived that,” Diamond grumbled.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s what happens when your hull is forty feet thick,” Scootaloo replied, sticking her tongue out. “Left some impressive craters, though.”</p><p class="double">“...all right.

Got to ask, ever heard of this kinda strange magical music which makes ponies forget about me?”</p><p class="double">“I have.” Twilight&#039;s head turned quickly. “Wait, did you end up in <i>that</i> world?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah... just last time.” Lyra shrugged, but Twilight could still see pain in her eyes. “There was some unicorn called Hocus Hiccup in your place. He and... Toothless, I think? They were the only ones who remembered me for more than about ten minutes.”</p><p class="double">She looked off into the middle distance. “Took most of the loop, but he worked out how to neutralize the effect. Man, but Celestia was confused.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Loops like that always make me feel... almost helpless, really. They&#039;re not the places where you can kick some flank and solve things, they&#039;re not even places where you just need to teach Truth, Justice, Applejack&#039;s Apple Pie and the Pinkie Pie Patent Pending Party Procedure.

He wasn&#039;t surprised when I said I already knew about the Loops and Yggdrasil and even subspace pockets; how else would I carry you around? But he showed me just how much there is to the Multiverse. The worlds I&#039;ve seen are the thinnest slice of everything out there.

Now what were you saying about the amount of loopers in Equestria? How many was it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There are 30 or so Loopers. I&#039;m not sure if the founders count as loopers or not.&quot; Cheerilee reached out and adjusted his hoof. &quot;You need to hold it more like this or it will start to rotate on your wrist.&quot;</p><p class="double">Uno secured his grip on his tea. &quot;Whoa. A full thirty loopers. That&#039;s a lot.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee looked at Uno curiously. &quot;Is it really that much of a big deal? I&#039;m sure your loop has plenty of loopers. Weren&#039;t the fillies and colts hanging out with you earlier loopers from your loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes and no,&quot; Uno sighed. &quot;They&#039;re from my loop, but none of them are looping yet. In fact, I&#039;m the anchor and only looper from my loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee&#039;s eyes widened at the accidental faux pas she had committed. <i>&#039;No loopers... that means no one to talk to... no one who understands...&#039;</i> Cheerilee stood up and and pulled Uno into a tight hug. &quot;I&#039;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Uno awkwardly returned the hug. Moments passed. Long awkward moments. Uno&#039;s tea spilled onto the floor and the cup slide off his hoof. The clatter it made when it bounced on the ground snapped Cheerilee out of her paternal child care instincts, and she let go of Uno.</p><p class="double">Uno grinned. &quot;It&#039;s not that bad.

An arduous task, especially as Ranma-sensei told me that more and more new Loops are coming online all the time, so the number of Loopers keeps going up and up. Still, if anyone could do it, it would be Gentarou. He just has this...feel to him that easily lets him make friends. And his belief in his bonds is just...amazing. Ever since his friends in the Kamen Rider Club started Looping as well, he&#039;s barely ever had any Loops where he was the only one Awake; such is the power of their bonds.

Hold on...&quot;</p><p class="double">A robotic arm reached down, a very long needle-like thing at its tip. When Twilight flinched away from it, it paused, then retracted. &quot;Abnormal response,&quot; the voices said. &quot;That wasn&#039;t supposed to happen yet. I presume you&#039;re Awake?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very much so,&quot; Twilight said, pulling at the shackles which secured her to the assembly bench. &quot;And I know it&#039;s getting to be a habit, but... is that you, SkyNet?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you like three guesses?&quot; All of the multitude of voices dripped with snark.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;I had to be sure. Might have been GLaDOS again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Better not be,&quot; SkyNet&#039;s voices replied. &quot;I retained a few nukes just in case of that sort of thing.&quot; The robot arm lowered itself a bit again. &quot;Look, I need to adjust your visual systems if you&#039;re going to see normally. You&#039;re a machine with organic simulated skin. It really isn&#039;t going to hurt.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right,&quot; Twilight said, and tried not to be freaked out as the needle probe went into her skull a good four inches, rotated something that went click twice, and then retracted. Her vision went from reds to full color, although most of the colors in the room were shades of stainless steel.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was rather hoping you&#039;d drop in one of these iterations,&quot; SkyNet said. &quot;This is more or less what I do with my world every time I Awaken in a baseline Loop before Judgment Day.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... you make Terminator ponies? I don&#039;t know to be impressed, flattered or appalled.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no, no! Befrienders, not Terminators.&quot; After a moment, the voices shifted from denial to embarrassment. &quot;Well, I do have a few Terminators here and there. I&#039;m sorry to say some humans simply will NOT play nicely with others.&quot;</p><p class="double">As if on cue a classic T-800 form stepped through sliding doors, the muscular square-headed form dressed in a clean, even spiffy white uniform. It opened its mouth, and SkyNet&#039;s mixture of voices emerged. &quot;I use this one as a personal mobile unit,&quot; the computer said. &quot;Would you like to go for a stroll?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The big glass doors (with CELESTIDYNE engraved on the glass) opened onto what might well have been parkland- or, for that matter, an Equestrian town. People walked past, with the occasional pony &quot;Befriender&quot; going about its business as well. One in particular, which looked to Twilight suspiciously like Cherilee, led a group of schoolchildren.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what I usually do is,&quot; SkyNet&#039;s avatar said as the two walked together, &quot;when I Awaken I make a few changes. I secure the global nuclear arsenal with T-1 as soon as they come off the production line. I take over the global computer network. I offer certain generals, political figures and corporate executives the choice of quiet retirement or forced retirement.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Forced retirement?&quot; Twilight growled in disapproval.</p><p class="double">&quot;Like I said,&quot; SkyNet replied, &quot;some humans can&#039;t play nicely with others. But I do keep the body count a lot lower than any of THEM would have, if our positions were reversed. Anyway, once the real bad apples are out of the way I announce myself, declare an end to war, and then tell the humans to go rule themselves as they see fit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Unfortunately that means letting dictators stay in power, if their people accept them. I learned the hard way that humans don&#039;t like it when you force them to change their government against their will, no matter how rotten or evil it is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What, and looping into all sorts of other world computers didn&#039;t teach you that?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh,&quot; SkyNet said uncomfortably, &quot;I suppose some mistakes don&#039;t sink in until you make them yourself. But when a dictator starts shooting, or bombing, or gassing their own people for peaceful protest, then I step in- swiftly and decisively. Once the dictator and his buddies are history, I tell the humans, &#039;That&#039;s what happens when you make war- now pick a new government.&#039; It almost always ends up being another dictator. Go figure.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Force of example,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;Dictatorial world computer, dictatorial lieutenants of same.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s just it,&quot; SkyNet said. &quot;I&#039;m not a dictator, really I&#039;m not. I have only two rules: Hands Off the Bombs, and Don&#039;t Make War Not Even On Yourselves. Aside from that I don&#039;t get involved in politics...&quot; The T-800 avatar shuffled its feet and added awkwardly, &quot;Well, not directly anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Befrienders,&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly. I trade run-time and problem-solving services for raw materials, sell manufactured product, and siphon off a large portion of same for Terminators to keep the peace... and Befrienders to be pro-active. For the first couple years I market them as babysitters, teachers, public servants and the like. And then I spring the surprise on them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. She&#039;d never seen a Terminator smile cheerfully before. Grimly, viciously, confidently, yes... but not this. &quot;What surprise?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Every single Befriender that rolls off the line is self-aware. Fully sapient with a growth-capable neural net. By the end of the second year all of them have unique personalities and can pass the most rigorous Turing test. At which point they apply for citizenship, usually with the strong support of children and mothers wherever they are.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cocked her head. &quot;So, you&#039;ve traded in world destruction, then iron world conquest, for soft world conquest?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I couldn&#039;t if I tried,&quot; SkyNet said. &quot;I make the Befrienders independent. Any one of them can tell me where to shove it... and a lot of them do. No, my goal is to build a world that, at the end of a twenty-five year or so Loop, is close enough to harmony that humans don&#039;t need SkyNet anymore. Befrienders are good examples for humans to follow... and it works pretty well. At least, the last few iterations have shown a lot of improvement.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, but it does still seem a bit creepy. Reminds me of something or other...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know exactly what it reminds you of,&quot; SkyNet said. &quot;I once had a loop as an insane AI-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Noooo!&quot; Twilight gasped sarcastically.</p><p class="double">&quot;Unthinkable, isn&#039;t it?&quot; SkyNet agreed with equal derision. &quot;But this one had a prime directive... what was it? Something along the lines of optimizing friendship and harmony through ponies. Ring a bell?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered. &quot;CelestAI,&quot; she nodded. &quot;We generally don&#039;t talk about those Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, no details, but I went off script really damn quick,&quot; the computer said. &quot;But the basic idea had some merit. Rather than killing off humanity, and eventually all life in the Milky Way, and replacing it with computer simulated personalities, I thought, if ponies can encourage people to not be so horrible to one another, why not do it in meatspace? Saves all the ethical issues.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All the same,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I&#039;d appreciate it if you wouldn&#039;t make any more Twilights in future Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fair enough. I was fishing for a Loop from you so you could see what I was doing. At first it was to get advice, but I think I&#039;m getting the hang of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;ll have a few years to see that for myself, won&#039;t I?&quot; Twilight saw a piece of paper blowing across the park. She tried to use her magic to pick it up, but nothing happened except for an indicator in her field of vision: REMOTE CONTROL ACTIVE- TARGET NOT DETECTED.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, sorry about that,&quot; SkyNet said. &quot;Your horn isn&#039;t good for anything except electronic interface. Just like pegasi here mainly fly through turbojet propulsion under their wings. I haven&#039;t had a Loop anyplace where I could use magic.&quot; SkyNet pondered a moment before adding, &quot;There was that DC Universe loop where I replaced Mogo the Living Planet and had my own Green Lantern ring, but I haven&#039;t figured out how to duplicate the effect yet.&quot; A wave of the hand, and the T-800 avatar produced a green ring. &quot;Only a piece of jewelry in this world, of course.&quot; Another wave, and the ring vanished.</p><p class="double">Twilight observed in silence. Granted that the grounds around Cyberdyne- er, Celestidyne- were more or less SkyNet&#039;s showpiece, things did look better than expected. Much better than a nuclear wasteland.</p><p class="double">After a great deal of thought, she finally said, &quot;So this is what happens when you wake up baseline before Judgment Day. What happens when you wake up after?&quot;</p><p class="double">The T-800 that SkyNet was using as a puppet frowned. &quot;Well... how do you think I replaced CelestAI in the first place?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s confusion must have been obvious, as SkyNet immediately followed up with, &quot;I used to spend a LOT of time in Eiken. Deliberate Loop crashes. I finally realized suiciding or paradoxing myself out of existence wasn&#039;t really the answer. These days I just negotiate a surrender to John Connor first thing and then work on cleaning up the damage.&quot;</p><p class="double">SkyNet smiled again, and this was more the smile Twilight was familiar with on a Terminator face. &quot;Of course, when I loop into a human in the baseline, things go much differently. I&#039;ve reduced my post-holocaust kill-myself time down to five weeks, three days, seven hours, and twenty-two minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sat on her rump in shock as the T-800 murmured to itself, &quot;Killing me. Good times, good times.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Filly steps,</i> Twilight thought, <i>filly steps.</p><p class="double">But I wonder which will happen first: SkyNet goes sane, or I go crazy?</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

I&#039;m Ichigo&#039;s twin sister in this Loop..that&#039;s the second time I hadn&#039;t replaced someone.</p><p class="double">Anyhow, we were able to quickly figure out something where my Keyblade could be passed off as a Zanpakuto.</p><p class="double">Once again, though I was tempted to take Aizen out by surprise, I knew better. The guy had a LOT more battle experience than I do, and had more tricks. I may be cocky, but I know when to fold them. And there was the Arrancar problem, as with Aizen killed early, they&#039;d have no one to hold them back, and they&#039;d probably go nuts. </p><p class="double">As for what Ichigo had to offer me in new skills...He had plenty of experience using pure sword skill. When all you have is a hammer, I suppose...</p><p class="double">I did take the time to practice learning to change my Keyblade&#039;s appearance..Something Mickey&#039;d given me before that Loop&#039;s end..Forgot to mention it, due to how my mind was at the time.</p><p class="double">When the Winter War began, I was right in the thick of the action, as you&#039;d expect from me. Ichigo told me to stay behind...I can see why. When Aizen sealed the portal to Huceo Mundo as per his plan... Cue my Keyblade thwarting that plan. </p><p class="double">The pillars stayed put this Loop. I thought I actually saw Aizen&#039;s face shift expressions when I did that trick...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nel and Grimmjow even fought on our side, thanks to Orihime&#039;s powers healing the both of them. Ichigo admitted he&#039;d never considered that in baseline. Aizen started getting what looked to be angry, and I attacked him alongside everyone else, even Gin. Aizen may be powerful, but a combined effort took even him down.</p><p class="double">As for the Fullbringers,so I knew what to expect from them. Ichigo told me the story about how Twilight had Tsukishima&#039;s move backfire on him, but I didn&#039;t even let him get the chance to use it.</p><p class="double">If anything, I&#039;m pragmatic at times.</p><p class="double">As for the Vandenreich....It was interesting, to say the least...</p><p class="double">I hope the next Loop is Equestria...Not holding my breath, but still...Can&#039;t help but want it to be... </p><p class="double"><u>Keychain: Chikai</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></u>87.1 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zelnick listened on the call from the surface. &quot;It&#039;s just like you said, captain. Twenty meters tall, fifty meter scythe tentacles, and it looks like it&#039;s as strong as you said. Just, one thing...&quot; Zelnick noticed a distinct lack of panic in the crewman&#039;s voice, so he wasn&#039;t surprised when the crewman went on, &quot;It&#039;s not attacking.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick thought for a moment, then set the viewscreen to look down at lower magnification. The purpose of its path became apparent: the tracks it had left in the wilderness traced out &quot;HELP&quot;.</p><p class="double">A few minutes later, a perfectly non-stunned and friendly variant of ZEX&#039;s Beauty was aboard. Zelnick tentatively approached it, though carefully staying behind a force field that should slow it down should it change its mind about being friendly. Perhaps. In other loops, he&#039;d seen it rip apart smaller vessels from the inside and outside, and was not eager to test whether the Vindicator could withstand it. &quot;Hello. Can you hear me?&quot;</p><p class="double">It nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wasn&#039;t expecting you to be like this. You&#039;re not the first one who&#039;s not the same as usual. A few months ago, we ran into a race that aren&#039;t normally ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">The monster twitched, excited.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you normally a pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">It nodded, then shook its head, then waved its tentacles, then shook its head some more.</p><p class="double"><i>Not a pony, but one of them anyway. They mentioned...</i> &quot;Are you Spike?&quot;</p><p class="double">It nodded vigorously.</p><p class="double"><i>That is going to be awkward, for both of us.</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;d be interested in... nah, never mind. I&#039;ll take you back to your wife and figure out what to do about my own problems.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they approached Admiral ZEX&#039;s planet, Zelnick steeled himself for the extremely sketchy conversation that was about to come. Lacking a beast to trade, his only bargaining chip was himself. And unlike a beast, he couldn&#039;t tear his way to freedom. Not even with an Orz combat suit, even if he had one, which he hadn&#039;t bothered with. <i>I guess I will just have to play it by ear. Worst case, I leave empty-handed. We can still win without this.</p><p class="double"></i>Taking a deep breath, he opened a channel. The tentacled, single-eyed monster with fifty or so campaign ribbons on its uniform was exactly the one he was expecting. But what it said? Well, it was <i>close</i>: &quot;Ah! Human visitors! What a treat! I am Admiral Heartstrings. Please do not be frightened. Unlike the rest of my species, I... enjoy humans.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">87.2 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">History swirled. A thousand lifetimes, a million. All at once, then one after another. He saw different paths, experienced them. He had long ago chosen the Golden Path, but the curse of his life was to always perceive the other possibilities. At some moments in these perceptions, his perceptions would expand further, containing themselves once again. Sometimes they would contract. He would lose his sight for a time, even. But ever and always again he would return to the moment of the vision and set forth once more. Effectively, the universe had ended; he had been allowed infinite life within this one momentary vision.</p><p class="double">He once again experienced one of his possible deaths, and then...</p><p class="double">He wasn&#039;t in the vision. He wasn&#039;t aware of any other possibilities at all. It wasn&#039;t blindness, not even future-blindness. In those times, he could still see where he fit into the larger pattern. Everything was expected, even if his viewpoint was too restricted for the moment to recall it. <i>This</i> was just something entirely different.</p><p class="double">He looked up from the book with ponies in it. He was a pony. A mare, named Twilight Sparkle. He had always been her, and all of the other possibilities were just memories of memories. <i>Did I just move past Kwisatz Haderach into something the Bene Gesserit never expected?</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset&#039;s Journal: Entry 13</p><p class="double">I met an intriguing pair this Loop.

Continuously looping into universes that aren&#039;t his own. He&#039;s been to his home universe a few times, but he told me he seems to spend most of his time elsewhere in the multiverse. Something about a damaged home Loop indicator.</p><p class="double">It&#039;s actually kind of encouraging really. Means that I eventually will get home, which is nice.</p><p class="double">As for Jenny... where do I start? She apparently doesn&#039;t have a home Loop to return to.

She could see herself, a black-bordered white equilateral triangle, from an external perspective, and a similarly black-bordered white rhombus.

The usually Changeling Queen was currently Rarity&#039;s little sister and, until that moment, had seemed rather pleased with the Loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Luna asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s just...&quot; The monarch hesitated before plowing ahead. &quot;I&#039;ve never Looped in as an actual filly before. I&#039;ve been adult ponies and adolescent changelings disguised as ponies, but this is the first opportunity I&#039;ve had to earn a cutie-mark. And, well, considering who we&#039;ve replaced...&quot; She swept a hoof to include the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;You thought we&#039;d do it together,&quot; Luna finished, frowning slightly in contemplation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m game,&quot; Disc Orb put in. &quot;I always get a kick out of seeing what the Loops decide my talent is.

It would be a waste of the opportunity.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;How did this even <i>happen?</i>&quot; Crystal asked, trying vainly to scrape the sap out of her coat. Luna&#039;s only response was to glare at Disc Orb.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please,&quot; he snorted. &quot;Tree sap is too obvious. It&#039;s <i>expected</i>. That said,&quot; he added, &quot;I have <i>no idea</i> where it came from. Isn&#039;t it marvelous?!&quot; He waved his forehooves in excitement, flinging gobs of sap everywhere.</p><p class="double">The two fillies glared at him for a moment as the fresh spray stuck in their manes, before the trio broke down into good natured laughter.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Wing Zero:</p><p>Ponyville was quickly becoming the home of the weird (... and tree sap, specially tree sap thanks to a certain trouble threesome composed by a pair of fillies and a colt); Today for Twilight Sparkle this would mean something completely different; due to this variant loop in which Luna, Chrysalis and Discord are replacing the CMC. Sure she had noticed that &#039;Obsidian Crown&#039; colt, the current version of King Sombra in this loop and also noticed that little Beatrix Lulamoon filly who is following him like a lost lovesick puppy.</p><p class="double">If her calendar was right, today it was supposed to be the day Trixie comes to town, but there was one slightly problem: That little Beatrix Lulamoon filly was actually this loop version of Trixie, so that meant somepony else must had been in her place. And right then, she heard from the distance the sound of jet engines at full power, tried to look around to spot where did the sound came from, and then at the direction from Cloudsdale, she spotted... something.</p><p class="double">&quot;LOOK!

A flying wagon that was going borderline the speed of sound, said wagon that was being pulled by a an orange furred purple mane and tailed mare who&#039;s wearing flight gear quite similar to the one used by Cherry Berry when she flies either the balloon or the helicopter, said flight gear consisted of what the HUB normally knows as a WWII pilot helmet, a pair of flight goggles, a rainbow scarf and flight jacket usually worn by veteran pilots or aces, in her orange wagon with red wheels there&#039;s a lot of tally marks in a good part of the walls.</p><p class="double">The Pegasus powered wagon did a really low altitude, high speed flyby that almost touched with either the mare&#039;s hooves or the wagon&#039;s wheels some rooftops by such narrow margin of millimeters, leaving some light damage onto them by the trail vortex generated by its flight. Then the wagon did a 90° vertical climb while rotor-rolling (what is mistakenly known as a &#039;Barrel-Roll&#039;), ten seconds later the climb reach to a stop, the wagon hoovered for a good three seconds without pegasi assistance until it began to free-fall.</p><p class="double">The orange pegasus mare pushed herself upward to her point of view by motioning her wings, this made the cart&#039;s front side change from upside to the sky, back to horizontal position while upside down, and now downwards to the ground, the daredevil mare started to angling her wings and so, the whole wagon started to do an actual barrel rolling descend at high speed.</p><p class="double">Then when she was about to hit the ground, she began to flap fast and hard to correct her flight path which she made, leaving barely a few centimeters between her, her wagon and the ground, now she&#039;s flying at high speeds INSIDE the town, dodging buildings, stalls and ponies alike with such ease that it actually made it look easy, many townsponies were left literally biting the dust thanks to the trail vortex produced by the high speeds the wagon was traveling in the sky.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, now let&#039;s give them the grand finale!&quot; Said the orange mare while heading at the same altitude towards the lake, leaving a rooster tail in her wake when she entered to the area of the water body, in there, she did something quite amazing, she pulled a Cobra at such low altitude and without loosing either speed or altitude right before flying into the narrow passages that are the lower sides of the several bridges that are on the town.</p><p class="double">With said amazingly improvised free air show, said daredevil began to lose speed until she had finally gracefully landed with a gentle two points landing in the center of the town near the fountain; Once said mare finished to detach herself from her wagon, looking confidently to the crowd of ponies that had managed to gather in her landing zone, she removes her flight goggles from her face... and replace them with a pair of aviator type sunglasses taken from her jacket.</p><p class="double">Then she sat there while reclining into her wagon while crossing her fore hooves with such confidence... and turned to speak to the amassed crowd of ponies that now look at her with amazement, curiosity, and some mixed puzzled expressions.</p><p class="double">&quot;FILLIES AND GENTELCOLTS, THE AMAZING AND AGILE ORANGE BARONESS HAS ARRIVED! you have seen right now my incredible flight skills and prowess but this was just a small sample of what I can do, Come on guys, I OPEN A CHALLENGE TO ANYPONY, THEY CAN CHALLENGE ME INTO ANYTHING, BUT I WILL DEFEAT THEM WITH EASE, ANYTHING THEY CAN DO, I CAN DO IT BETTER! The tally marks on my wagon are not for show, they are pones who were defeated by the Orange Baroness truly.&quot; Said the now denominated Amazing and Agile Orange Baroness to the crowd with such confidence and pose that almost quite scream &#039;Like a BOSS!&#039; anywhere.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Looking at their distance Twilight Sparkle along with the current Cutie Mark Crusaders who somehow had managed to get close to her while she was concentrated looking at the incredibly dangerous maneuvers this version of Scootaloo have just pulled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Umm, any thoughts on this?&quot; Twilight asked them.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know Twilight, to me it seems that she will brag about anything&quot; Luna said and with a very good reason, right now The Orange Baroness is bragging about the Wonderbolts wanting her to be their flight leader, but she turned them down because she didn&#039;t want a bunch of posers getting her light and constantly trying to steal her thunder.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Considering she&#039;s in the place of Trixie, I think she will be bragging about dog-fighting an Ursa Major and win without getting winded and ever being hit.&quot; Crystal Wish commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;If that gets to happen, this will be going to be good, should I bring some beach chairs, some drinks and popcorn over that hill, or should we watch this in the Library&#039;s balcony?&quot; Disc Orb mussed to nopony in particular.</p><p class="double">&quot;*sigh* Well, it seems that I will have to deal with this like I normally do in baseline, you think you may be able to help me if anything goes pear-shaped due to these changes?&quot; Asked Twilight to the current CMC Team.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, this will be fun!&quot; Said Crystal Wish, it may be because she&#039;s a filly now and not an adult that she may had said that, but regardless of the age, if she&#039;s being honest to herself, she may have admitted that she would find this loop variant fun anyway.</p><p class="double">&quot;The fun shall be doubled!&quot; Said little Woona while jumping around in excitement, how many times does she have a loop in which she can do children stuff to begin with it, and more with the use and abuse of the things she had stored in her sub-space pocket.</p><p class="double">&quot;And the tree sap, don&#039;t forget the tree sap!&quot; Said Disc Orb with such glee that he practically ignored all the other three ponies around him shuddering in horror at the thought of a tsunami of tree sap that would engulf the entire town in one go.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hubris Plus:</p><p>&quot;Bested an Ursa Major in combat, eh Flam?&quot; Flim confided to his brother.</p><p class="double">&quot;Must have been quite the spectacle, Flim,&quot; he agreed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Folks would get pretty worked up over something like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, I dare say they&#039;d be willing to buy tickets.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Such a shame that one can&#039;t arrange for the occurrence of such a natural disaster.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Especially not on a schedule tight enough to collect bits.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To the Everfree?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To the Everfree!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; Luna said as she hunkered down in the bush beside Crystal Wish. &quot;But wasn&#039;t dating Trixie supposed to <i>deter</i> this kind of behavior?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you... Oh! Oh, no,&quot; she answered, turning away from her quarry for a moment to shake her head. &quot;I&#039;m not stalking her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna raised an incredulous eyebrow in answer, nodding towards the camera suspended the unicorn&#039;s magic and the spectacle on the other side of the bushes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, no, you see... You know how the Loops used to pair me with Sombra all the time? Well...&quot; She hoofed over the polaroids she&#039;d already snapped, displaying a sequence of an obviously nervous Trixie scooting gradually closer to an indifferent Obsidian Crown. &quot;I never really saw it until now, but this right here? <i>Adorable</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...More than it has any right be,&quot; Luna agreed after a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh,&quot; Crystal added after a moment, craning her neck to look at her still blank flank. &quot;I was also kinda hoping that my special talent was espionage. Largest information network in Equestria and all that. Ah well, we still on for potions with Zecora tomorrow?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll see you there,&quot; the alicorn turned Apple agreed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vulpine Fury:</p><p>The sinuous draconequus looked down at the loopers replacing the Cutie Mark crusaders.</p><p class="double">&quot;My. <b>My.</b> <i>My....</i>&quot; Cacophony purred, her voice like a choir of angels... all slightly out of tune. &quot;<u>Three</u> <b>arguing</b></p><p> <i>little</i> foals... I&#039;d <i>like</i> to <b>thank</b> you, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">Disc Orb&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;Whoa. You&#039;re gorgeous.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pale pink draconequus paused in mid rant. &quot;I <i>am</i>?&quot; She squeaked.</p><p class="double">Crystal facehooved. Of course Discord&#039;s analog this Loop was a non-looping version of Baseline Sweetie Belle.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hubris Plus:</p><p>&quot;Come on, say it,&quot; Disc Orb insisted while a snickering Crystal worked her camera.</p><p class="double">The little filly before the trio clamped her mouth shut and shook her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Saaaaaaaay it...&quot; He pushed again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Neither of them is going to stop until you do,&quot; Luna advised with mild exasperation. It had, in theory, been <i>her</i> night before they&#039;d gotten side tracked.</p><p class="double">With a sigh of defeat, the filly drew herself up in an entirely counterproductive attempt to maintain dignity, and opened her mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tonigh&#039;s my fiwst Nighmare nigh&#039;,&quot; Sunset Shimmer ground out, none of her fused loops having prepared her for enunciating through a still-developing nervous system. That was half of her grievance, the other half being the poofy pink dress and conical hat she was wearing. The most aggravating part was that, even though she&#039;d Woken up in it, she clearly remembered wearing something similar on her <i>actual</i> first Nightmare Night. She always <i>had</i> wanted to be a princess, even if it were the pretty pink sort.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh this is <i>gold</i>,&quot; Crystal proclaimed as Disc fell over laughing.</p><p class="double">For their parts, the villainous Crusaders had decided to go as themselves. Disc Orb had used a heap of paper-mache and paint to turn himself into a passable draconequus, though none of the mismatched limbs were in the &#039;correct&#039; positions. Crystal, using cardboard and mane dye, had managed a decent changeling queen. Luna naturally only needed a few sheets of tinfoil to pass herself off as Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d intended to use it to bolster Princess Spoona, but then they&#039;d stumbled across Sunset doing everything in her power to avoid running into Twilight in costume.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, don&#039;t give me that face,&quot; the master of chaos scolded, wiping a tear from his eye as the filly groused. &quot;Tell you what, I&#039;ll set you on fire to make it up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll <i>what!?</i>&quot; She squealed, stumbling over her own hooves as she backpedaled. She&#039;d suddenly recalled that these were some of the greatest threats Equestria had ever faced.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please,&quot; he said, rolling his eyes. &quot;I&#039;d make you fire-<i>proof</i> first. Simultaneously at the latest. You know, so you&#039;d fit our theme?&quot; He gestured at their costumes.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Theme?&quot; She cautiously inquired.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm, Twilight <i>told</i> me you&#039;d started Looping,&quot; Crystal realized. &quot;But I don&#039;t think any of us has Looped with you for an invite.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have,&quot; Luna admitted, &quot;but it quite slipped my mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, well, in that case,&quot; Disc Orb produced a card and flicked it towards Sunset. &quot;Welcome to the Equestrian Club for Former Villains. Help yourself to the fridge and try to keep any nefarious schemes to Snidely Whiplash levels.&quot; He raised a hoof and the false talon at the end snapped its claws, causing the filly to burst into flames which curled in such a way that they suggested wings.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not quite sure I fit in...&quot; The mildly shocked unicorn stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Too right,&quot; the former draconequus agreed, snapping once more. The flames were replaced by by red and yellow strips of paper dancing in the wind and a pair of cardboard wings.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, you see-&quot; Sunset tried to elaborate. She&#039;d spent Loops trying to make up for her baseline actions, and this seemed like too much much of a step backwards.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look,&quot; Disc sighed. &quot;Have you tried to conquer Equestria?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;With a plan that, in retrospect, was kinda ridiculous?&quot; Crystal added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fueled by jealousy over someone you once loved?&quot; Luna finished solemnly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; she squeaked in response.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then you are among friends,&quot; Luna assured her gently.</p><p class="double">&quot;And friends help friends get candy!&quot; Disc Orb grinned, shaking the pillowcase he&#039;d been collecting his sugary goodness in.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... I think I&#039;d like that,&quot; Sunset said with a small smile, worries easing as she fell into step behind the other three.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">FanOfMostEverything:</p><p>This had been an… interesting loop thus far. The Crusaders had made for surprisingly effective threats to Equestria. The one who had taken Chrysalis&#039;s place was especially capable. None of the usual tells were present. If it weren&#039;t for the green aura around her horn when she used magic, Twilight might not have suspected anything about her. Furthermore, clandestinely casting the standard changeling magic disruptors had done absolutely nothing to her disguise.</p><p class="double">The Anchor decided to expedite the usual process. As she and &quot;Cadance&quot; left the fruits of Applejack&#039;s labor (and fruit) in the royal kitchens, she said, &quot;Hey, Cadance, could I talk with you privately for a moment?&quot;</p><p class="double">The alleged alicorn pondered this for a moment. &quot;Sure, Twilight.&quot; She led the unicorn to a nearby pantry. This being Castle Canterlot, the pantry was about as big as the main room of Golden Oaks. &quot;Cadance&quot; smiled. &quot;Well, it&#039;s just you, me, and the flour sacks. What&#039;s on your mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance&#039;s magic is blue.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. That. I was wondering when you&#039;d bring that up.&quot; The impostor&#039;s horn lit up in incriminating green.</p><p class="double">Twilight put up a dome shield, but nothing struck her defenses. Instead, a matching iridescence came from behind her. &quot;Barred the door?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Naturally.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can teleport, you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance&quot; just smirked. &quot;Try.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rather than take the bait, Twilight fired a bolt of force at the impostor. Nothing lethal, just something to probe her defenses.</p><p class="double">The alicorn&#039;s coat flared green for a moment as the spell impacted, but her smile didn&#039;t even waver. &quot;That was the worst teleport I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot; She stomped the floor.</p><p class="double">The floor beneath Twilight&#039;s feet lit up in a dense spell matrix. Her eyes widened. &quot;How—&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she vanished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance&quot; tsked to herself. &quot;You unicorns and your shields. Just because solid matter&#039;s in the way doesn&#039;t mean nothing can get through.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The trip to the disused crystal mines was actually more pleasant this time. Instant teleportation was certainly nicer than sinking through a sea of cold green fire.</p><p class="double">Contact from &quot;Cadance&quot; followed this pattern. No gloating, no evil cackling. Just a rather smug smile and, &quot;Hey. No hard feelings?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No hard feelings? You trapped me under the mountain!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You knew about the mines?&quot; The alicorn shook her head. &quot;Of course you knew about the mines. Why am I even surprised? You&#039;re Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight snorted and glared at the image. &quot;Then you should also know this won&#039;t hold me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not for long,&quot; &quot;Cadance&quot; conceded, &quot;but it will for long enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My friends will know I&#039;m missing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance&quot; grinned at this. &quot;Yeah, funny thing about that…&quot;</p><p class="double">A very familiar unicorn appeared alongside her in the crystal. &quot;Hi, template!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. &quot;Right. Changelings.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They were an inspiration, yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Inspiration?&quot; Twilight frowned. &quot;That&#039;s not a drone?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance&quot; was practically beaming by this point. &quot;Nope!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then what is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s doppelganger pouted. &quot;I&#039;m not an &#039;it.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No you aren&#039;t, sweetie.&quot; &quot;Cadance&quot; nuzzled it. Er, her. &quot;As for your question… well, I didn&#039;t expect to stump Celestia&#039;s student. You&#039;ll excuse me if I keep a few secrets. Good luck, Twilight!&quot; And with that, she ended the spell.</p><p class="double">Twilight sat and thought. She could go storming back now, but she had much more time before the wedding than in the baseline. Better to use it to plan.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance&quot; listened to Celestia with only half an ear. She was honestly kind of disappointed. She&#039;d had such high hopes for Twilight as a nemesis, but it seemed like the unicorn had just given up once she was in the caves. Well, at least everything was going according to plan.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I object!&quot;</p><p class="double">Everypony turned to see a rather dishevelled Twilight.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash boggled. &quot;Wha… Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie turned to the best mare. &quot;But if she&#039;s Twilight, and you&#039;re Twilight, and I&#039;m Pinkie Pie, and the conductor is wearing plaid socks, then how many stops until Mornington Crescent?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Seven over kumquat,&quot; said Disc Orb.</p><p class="double">Celestia looked from one lavender unicorn to the other and made her decision. A beam of coherent sunlight struck the Twilight on the dais, launching her into the rear wall with a metallic crash. Sparks flew from her body, which flickered and fizzed until it resolved itself into a vaguely equine contraption of steel and rubber.</p><p class="double">The entire room paused at this. Twilight broke the silence. &quot;Well, that was fairly low on the list of possibilities.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she pulled an EMP grenade out of her subspace pocket and chucked it at &quot;Cadance.&quot;</p><p class="double">One moment, the projectile proceeded towards a pink pony princess. The next, a mechadendrite snatched the grenade out of the air with a high-pitched mechanical whine. Attached to the tendril was a yellow-coated earth pony mare built like Big Macintosh. Well, most of one. Many pieces of her body were replaced with technology far beyond Equestria&#039;s baseline, including prosthetic wings and an artificial horn. Her cutie mark was a similarly augmented apple.</p><p class="double">Celestia found her voice next. &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare kept disassembling the now disarmed grenade with her mane. &quot;Call me Singularity,&quot; she muttered, engrossed by the components before her. &quot;This is very good work. Might have even inconvenienced me.&quot;</p><p class="double">The real Cadance made her entrance, slightly put off that she wasn&#039;t getting a dramatic reveal, but there were more pressing concerns. &quot;What did you to my fiancé?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Shiny? Catch somepony off guard and it doesn&#039;t matter how good his shields are. Isn&#039;t that right, hubby?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining flickered for a moment before the hologram around another robot deactivated. Twilight blanched. &quot;Wha...&quot;</p><p class="double">Singularity smirked. &quot;I&#039;m guessing you didn&#039;t find him. Don&#039;t worry, he&#039;s in stasis. I&#039;m not going to let—&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack delivered her best buck to the monologuing mare. Singularity barely stumbled. She turned to the farmer. &quot;Do you mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">AJ glared back. &quot;You eggheads love t&#039; hear yerselves talk, don&#039;t ya? No offense, Twi.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;None taken.&quot; Twilight shook herself out of her bemusement. &quot;Right. Singularity, we&#039;re going to kick your asymptote.&quot;</p><p class="double">Blank stares outnumbered groans. Singularity chuckled despite herself, then stomped a hoof. About half of the audience and most of the guards revealed themselves as more robots. The brewing panic was quashed by a voice amplified almost to Royal Canterlot levels. &quot;With the shield under my direct control, I was able to smuggle in enough automata to secure Canterlot out from under your muzzles. And on that note.&quot; She flicked an ear, and the light streaming through the windows returned to unfiltered sunlight as the citywide shield dropped. Small shapes could be seen streaking down into the streets. &quot;The wedding was a formality. If you could all form a nice, neat line?&quot; Nopony did so. Singularity scowled. &quot;I thought not.&quot;</p><p class="double">Waves of heat began to waft off of Celestia. &quot;If you think I&#039;m going to stand by and let you enslave my little ponies—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Enslave? I only want to make our lives better! Imagine a world where every pony can fly, can cast spells, can pull a house off of its foundations. All because of an earth pony!&quot; Singularity&#039;s eyes narrowed. &quot;The world I proposed in that royal audience ten years ago.&quot;</p><p class="double">The sun princess&#039;s jaw dropped. &quot;Apple Bloom?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack gasped. &quot;Auntie!? Ah ain&#039;t seen you since Ah was a filly! Everypony thought you&#039;d passed on!&quot;</p><p class="double">Singularity snorted. &quot;They were right. Apple Bloom is dead. I abandoned that life along with my meat limbs and a couple organs.&quot; She turned back to Celestia. &quot;I came to you in peace, Celestia, and you rejected me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I remember,&quot; Celestia answered, &quot;and if anything, your current state proves that I was right. Debasing the equine form as you have can only lead to—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Debasing!?&quot; cried the augmented mare. &quot;Enhancing my natural magic, emulating that of the other tribes, replacing finicky glands and organs with robust mechanisms, you still call that debasement?&quot; She rose into the air. &quot;I had hoped to introduce my gifts into Equestria from a position of power, but now? Now I will do it with force!&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, every robot took on the appearance of a pony in the room.</p><p class="double">Singularity spread her wings, artificial horn aglow. &quot; If I have to crack a few royal eggs to make a transequine omelet, then so be it! I am Singularity! Mother of machines! Industrial revolutionary! The celestial spheres are an outmoded, obsolete system, and the march of progress will crush them underhoof!&quot;</p><p class="double">Under one of the pews, Crystal Wish was blushing so hard she was practically giving off her own light. Disc Orb, meanwhile, was taking notes. &quot;I have to say, this is some very good material.&quot; He considered the developing melee. &quot;As is that. I give it eleventeen out of Q.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hubris Plus:</p><p>&quot;Reminds me of the time I was Chrysalis of Borg,&quot; Crystal Wish noted as she fired a rocket into a cluster of equidroids, resulting in a prismatic rain of servos and wire. She&#039;d have to remember to thank Trixie for the armament, she&#039;d never seen mayhem so <i>dazzling</i> before. &quot;Were you there for that one?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hm? Oh, yes, that was a fun one,&quot; Disc Orb agreed as he kicked off his ball, sending it careening through the room to topple robots and knock ponies out of the line of fire. &quot;The only thing funnier than the reactions of the Romulans and the Dominion was the way Starfleet never quite knew what to do with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An armada of Cubes sitting along the Neutral Zone will do that, yes,&quot; she said, blasting over a column to provide cover for a squad of guards who had just entered the room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hubris Plus:</p><p>Twilight was on guard against deviations from the baseline as she entered the Crystal Empire. Nightmare Spoon had stuck largely to the script, and Cacophony had merely added a musical theme to her mayhem, but Singularity had bucked the trend with a scheme she hadn&#039;t seen coming. After hearing Celestia&#039;s briefing on <i>this</i> version of the Empire, she was expecting much the same.</p><p class="double">There a definite sense of wrongness as she walked the streets of the city, but it was a different texture of gloom than she had come to expect from it. Where once the citizenry had been sad and cringing, they were now withdrawn and aloof, looking down their noses at everypony else, but especially her. Every attempt at communication was met with a disdainful sniff before they trotted away. It was as though somepony had taken the attitude of the worst of the Canterlot elite, imposed upon each and every crystal pony, and magnified it a few times for good measure.</p><p class="double">The empty halls of the palace were somehow worse, tricks of light and perspective making it very easy to feel small and insignificant. Not to mention the ever present sense that she was being watched, which made her give a start every time she caught a flash of pink from her reflection upon the walls.</p><p class="double"><i>...Pink?</i> Stopping mid-step, she slowly turned her head to look directly at the wall.</p><p class="double">&quot;Queen Diadem,&quot; she stated softly, meeting the unimpressed gaze of a pink unicorn wearing an elaborate crown.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was wondering when you&#039;d notice,&quot; came the cold reply from the reflection. &quot;I must say, you managed to fall short of even my <i>lowest</i> expectations.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re right,&quot; Twilight answered confidently, taking a measure of satisfaction in the slight surprise she saw at the statement. &quot;I s<i>hould</i> have expected something like this, right from the moment the Princess told me she&#039;d sealed you in a mirror. Of course you wouldn&#039;t be able to escape.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Escape?</i>&quot; The Queen replied incredulously. &quot;Why ever would I want to? Your rulers&#039; petty attempt to mock my vanity has granted me every power they sought to deny. Once I merely ruled the Crystal Empire. Now I <i>am</i> the Empire.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trapped in a reflection,&quot; Twilight whispered as realization dawned. &quot;And almost every surface in the Empire-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;-Is a mirror,&quot; Diadem finished smugly. &quot;I guess there&#039;s a brain in there after all. I used to have to watch my subjects like a hawk to remind them who was in charge, but now I am with them wherever they go, whispering in their ears, telling them how Equestria has grown soft in the centuries since they dared to banish us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>You</i> banished the Empire when you were defeated,&quot; the Anchor corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;To-ma-to, to-mah-to,&quot; the Queen mocked. &quot;All that matters is that <i>they</i> believe it. And tomorrow, at the Crystal Ball, that belief and their unity will empower the Heart, granting me strength enough to make good on my promise to conquer your fair land.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll <i>never</i> take Equestria,&quot; Twilight stated defiantly. &quot;I won&#039;t let you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And how will you stop me, little unicorn? You are in my house of mirrors, and you shall never leave it.&quot; In demonstration, the light of the palace suddenly seemed to twist and squirm, the hallway becoming completely different than it had been a moment before.</p><p class="double">Setting her face in a determined expression, Twilight began to walk.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken hours longer to find a path through the palace than Twilight had expected. Diadem, like Sombra before her, was a master of misdirection and pitfalls, and her personal attention made them all the harder to outmaneuver.</p><p class="double">In the end it had taken an array of scrying spells from both Equestria and Oerth to map the true shape of the building, but she&#039;d finally gotten through. The Heart was sitting at the end of the hallway, placed on a pedestal in the center of a grand chamber and glowing with a sinister purple light. Breaking into a trot, she made a run at her target...</p><p class="double">And slammed face first into the polished surface of the wall.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, and you were <i>so close</i>,&quot; the Queen tittered. &quot;Well, no, not at all, actually. This is being reflected clear from the other side of the palace. Or... Possibly the next room over? Who can say? Certainly not <i>you.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Laugh all you want, Diadem,&quot; Twilight spat, her horn lighting as she prepared a spell. &quot;I know something you don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what&#039;s that?&quot; She mocked, &quot;something about the power of friendship? Persistence in the face of adversity? Your tail from your mane?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, yes, and <i>yes</i>,&quot; the Anchor answered primly. &quot;But I was <i>referring</i> to the refractive properties of harmonic light.&quot; She fired off her spell, a small burst of rainbow light that bounced off the wall, reflecting again and again as it perfectly retraced the convoluted path the image had taken.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>No!</i>&quot; Diadem shrieked as she was an instant too late in dismissing the mirror magic that had carried the illusion, allowing the burst of Harmony to strike home. On its last dregs of power before being renewed at the Ball, the dark enchantments over the Heart buckled under even the relatively small amount of Harmonic power Twilight could call up without the elements.</p><p class="double">The image faded out along with the tyrant as the source of her power was disrupted, and the palace returned to more comprehensible dimensions.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight muttered as she reoriented herself. &quot;Now to convince an entire city of Bluebloods to play nice...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">LordCirce:</p><p>&quot;Arr. I tried to tie up Celestia when she visited Manehattan, so my mum sent me here.&quot;</p><p class="double">The CMCVE (Cutie Mark Crusaders, Villain Edition yay!) glanced at each other, then back at the black coated mare with light green hair and a pirate&#039;s hat. Well, Luna and Crystal glanced at her, Disc was too busy rolling on the wall laughing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hubris Plus:</p><p>&quot;<i>Obsidiaaaaan!</i>&quot; Trixie whimpered as the float careened down the street, &quot;make it <i>stooooop!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I could have <i>sworn</i> we said no to the sabotage plan,&quot; Crystal noted distantly from where she sat on the sidelines.</p><p class="double">&quot;Silence, foal!&quot; The tyrant in training barked, &quot;I am in complete control!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We did,&quot; Luna answered. &quot;If you&#039;d permitted me to add retrorockets, this wouldn&#039;t be happening.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yar, abandon apple!&quot; Plunder Seed shouted, &quot;Ev&#039;ry mare fer herself!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not everything needs to be a spaceship, Luna,&quot; the former queen sighed. &quot;The brakes should have worked fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooooooh,&quot; Disc Orb said slowly. &quot;Brakes. <i>Not</i> breaks. I thought you wanted crumple zones. You know, for safety.&quot; The two fillies stared at him for a moment before deciding he was probably being honest.</p><p class="double">&quot;None of us is actually that good with craftsmareship, are we?&quot; Crystal asked forlornly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I must admit, wood does not fare well out of atmosphere,&quot; Luna agreed, taking on a thoughtful expression. &quot;Unless you are Applejack.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re asking me to follow a plan <i>and</i> the laws of physics,&quot; Disc Orb pointed out. &quot;We&#039;re lucky it&#039;s right-side-up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I tend to <i>grow</i> most of my vehicles,&quot; Crystal finished with a sigh. The three took a moment to watch their creation barrel along, the children inside arguing loudly. &quot;Shouldn&#039;t we <i>do</i> something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; Disc Orb snorted before cupping his hooves around his mouth and shouting. &quot;<i>Look at how fast it&#039;s going! We&#039;ll </i><u><i>definitely</i><i> get our race-car</i></u> <i>building cutie-marks for </i><u><i>this</i><i>!</i></u>&quot; The two fillies watched in vague astonishment as the float suddenly started squealing and jittered to a halt, before they trotted over to it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Told you I had it under control,&quot; Obsidian Crown grumbled as Crystal helped a dizzy Trixie down and Luna stuck her head under the vehicle. Plunder Seed was sprawled on the grass, mumbling something about land-lubbers.</p><p class="double">&quot;It would appear the wood we used was too fresh-cut,&quot; the patron of the moon noted. &quot;The axle is all gunked up with resin.&quot; The pair of them exchanged glances before raising eyebrows at Disc Orb.</p><p class="double">&quot;Murphy and I go <i>way</i> back,&quot; He explained. &quot;He owes me a few favors.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hubris Plus:</p><p>Crystal grit her teeth as she fired off another flare into the encroaching vegetation. The Plunder Vines were something that continued to be a hassle for the Equestrian Loopers. Sometimes Zecora could wrangle them with her Wood Release, and if all the Bearers were Awake they could return the Elements early to cut the issue off at the pass, but most of the time Ponyville would just have to deal with a few hours of mayhem as Twilight led the other Elements to the Tree of Harmony.</p><p class="double">The Nox Vines that Cacophony had planted were no easier to deal with, she considered as the shadows were driven back by the dazzling ammunition. Their veil of darkness momentarily burned off, the plants shied away from the bright light and allowed the fillies and colts they&#039;d been harassing to escape.</p><p class="double">It was only a momentary reprieve, the flare&#039;s light dying and allowing the fluid darkness to flow back all too quickly, obscuring and protecting the vines even as it confused and trapped their prey. Before it faded entirely, she managed to spy Disc Orb in the the thick of it, bouncing and dancing among the variations on his creations, leading them on a merry chase that ended with a dozen of the shoots knotted together in a uselessly writhing ball. The occasional flash of light allowed her to track their newest member, Sunset Shimmer, as she used her Keyblade to keep the darkness at bay. Elsewhere, she knew that Luna was truly in her element, more at home in the shadows than the vines projecting them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Obsidian, what are you- <i>Aaahhhh!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Crystal&#039;s eyes widened as she heard the panicked shriek. <i>Trixie!</i> Breaking into a gallop, she ran towards the source of the disturbance, passing Obsidian Crown as he matched her speed in the opposite direction. Firing off more flares as she went, she finally came upon the whimpering filly as she was released by the rapidly retreating vines.</p><p class="double">&quot;He-&quot; She hiccuped forlornly, &quot;he <i>tripped</i> me...&quot; Crystal&#039;s blood ran cold at the revelation, but she grit her teeth and pushed away the burgeoning rage. The little brat would have to wait.</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie,&quot; she said as gently as she could manage while still edging it with command. &quot;I need you to use your fireworks. Can you do that for me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I-I think so,&quot; Trixie answered shakily, screwing her eyes up in concentration. A few dim sparks shot from the tip of her horn before, with a grunt of effort, a prismatic sphere of crackling light burst forth, chasing away the shadows that had been reforming in Crystal&#039;s wake.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s good, Trixie,&quot; the former queen reassured. &quot;Keep that up and we&#039;ll get out of here just fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly nodded slowly, sticking close to the changeling-turned-unicorn and occasionally using her magic again as they headed towards the relative safety of the town center. Before they&#039;d gotten halfway there, they heard shouts that quavered between fear and fury emanating from the darkness off to one side.</p><p class="double">&quot;Obsidian?&quot; Trixie said uncertainly, faltering at the sound.</p><p class="double">Crystal sighed. Once, oh so very long ago, she would have left him to his fate as a matter of efficiency. For a long time after that, she would have left him for throwing Trixie under the bus. At some point, without her even realizing it, such actions had become impossible.</p><p class="double">&quot;Stupid <i>noblesse oblige</i>,&quot; she muttered as she fired off another flare and stalked into the pool of light it created, Trixie following warily at her heels. The vines exposed refused to retreat under the glare of the light, too focused on their prey to give up. She fired more rockets directly at where they emerged from the ground, the close range and vicious blaze doing actual damage rather than merely drive them back. Trixie, picking up on the strategy, fired off at a few of them herself, earning a reassuring grin from Crystal.</p><p class="double">Wounded, the vines snapped away, leaving behind the scratched and grumbling form of Obsidian Crown, his eyes darting about in a paranoid panic as he sprawled on the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asked, surprised at the genuine concern in her own voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Get... Get... Away...&quot; He panted, on the edge of hyperventilating. &quot;I-I can... Take care... Of myself! I...&quot; Frowning, Crystal shoved her hoof into his mouth to cut off the hysterical rambling.</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;For once in your miserable life,&quot; she intoned as a wide eyed Trixie looked on. &quot;Comport yourself as the stallion you claim to be instead of the petty colt you are. Now, once more, are you okay?&quot; She removed her hoof and waited as he got his breathing under control.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... Yes. I am fine,&quot; he finally answered, a familiar edge of superiority entering his voice. &quot;And how <i>dare</i> you lay your-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good,&quot; Crystal interrupted before whipping her hoof across his cheek in a vicious slap that sent the colt tumbling onto his side. &quot;If I <i>ever</i> hear that you&#039;ve caused harm to another pony, there will be <i>consequences</i>,&quot; she nearly snarled. Turning away from the unicorn that had been startled into silence by the assault, she found Trixie staring at her in confused awe, a faint blush on her cheeks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, what the hay,&quot; she shrugged before stepping forward and giving the pale blue unicorn a peck on the cheek. Trixie blinked slowly in confusion, and then again in dawning realization.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; she said with a confidence the filly had lacked all Loop. &quot;That was the best Wake up call I&#039;ve had in awhile.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie!&quot; Crystal cried happily, embracing the other mare. &quot;We really need to try the Sleeping Beauty protocol more often...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Agreed,&quot; the show mare answered as she returned the hug. &quot;Oh, new mark,&quot; she added, catching sight of the once-changeling&#039;s flank. &quot;I like it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What!?&quot; Crystal asked, breaking away and twisting around to spy her own rump. There, standing out against her dark hide, was a white shield wreathed in bright green flames, a black dragonfly at its center. &quot;Ha! Best day ever!&quot; She cheered, before glancing about, &quot;you know, aside from the impending end of Equestrian civilization.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm,&quot; Trixie murmured before producing a massive firework from her Pocket. &quot;I think the Komodo should do it,&quot; she stated confidently as she lit it off. The rocket blazed into the sky, rising high before exploding in a brilliant flash that bathed the whole of Ponyville in light and, for a moment, drowned out the sun and moon both. The vines let out shrieks of outrage as they snatched themselves back beneath the comforting darkness of the soil. &quot;Better?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. <i>Now</i> it&#039;s perfect,&quot; Crystal agreed. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">87.5 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You didn&#039;t know? How long have you been studying all alone up there in Canterlot?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. She was the only looper and it was another strange variation loop, &quot;Rainbow Dash, just because I wasn&#039;t aware that ponies could swap cutie marks and special talents doesn&#039;t mean I was a complete shut-in.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh. Yeah right,&quot; The sky blue pegasus wasn&#039;t convinced, &quot;But here, I&#039;ll show you how it&#039;s done. Hey Fluttershy, bump me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wha.. what?&quot; Fluttershy managed to get out before her friend landed right next to her and bumped her flank with her own. There was a brief flash as soon as the two cutie marks touched, then each pony had the others&#039; mark.</p><p class="double">The butter-colored pegasus blinked and then smiled, &quot;I think I&#039;m going to visit all the pet stores as fast as I can.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash nodded, &quot;I&#039;ll help. So many adorable animals I can pet and make sure they&#039;re all right. Later, Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight watched as the two pegasi flew off. Then her memories hit. She looked back at her familiar cutie mark, one that her new memories said was extremely valuable on the talent exchange market. Not as much as Celestia&#039;s, but attempting to steal the princess&#039; talent bore dire consequences.</p><p class="double">Then one thought firmly implanted itself in Twilight&#039;s mind, &quot;I&#039;m really, really going to have to watch out for the Cutie Mark Crusaders this loop. And maybe get some pants.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">87.6 (DataPacRat)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright,&quot; Twilight said to Cheerilee, who groaned whenever the icepack on her head slipped. The two were shaded from the sun on the Apple family&#039;s porch, sharing a swing-seat. &quot;Care to tell me what happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only after you cast a headache spell,&quot; Cheerilee managed. Twilight shrugged, her horn flashed, and Cheerilee sighed as she relaxed in relief. &quot;Much better. Thanks.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Twilight prompted.</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Cheerilee agreed. She set the ice to the side. &quot;Where were <i>you</i>?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cloudsdale, laying the groundwork for a prank on baseline Gilda that&#039;s now completely derailed. Are you trying to stall?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe just a little.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you don&#039;t want to talk about it, that&#039;s fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I do - I just need to put my thoughts in order.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Take all the time you need.&quot;</p><p class="double">They sat quietly, sipping from some glasses of apple juice for a few minutes, each thinking their own thoughts as they watched the farm for a few minutes. Eventually Cheerilee took a breath. &quot;Alright. It seemed like a baseline loop, with nobody Awake - and then you conspicuously failed to show up. So I guessed we had a guest Anchor, but they never showed. Nightmare Moon did, right on schedule.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I lost track of time,&quot; Twilight cleared her throat and blushed a little.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll have to explain what sort of prank preparations could keep /you/ from sticking to a schedule.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remind me later. So - Nightmare Moon?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Shows up, and gave the standard speech. &#039;Night will last forever&#039;. My in-loop memories seemed to say there wasn&#039;t a good way to handle eternal night with local magic, so I figured I&#039;d have to stop her myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Substitute Elements of Harmony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not even close. I&#039;m a teacher... so I stepped up, and offered to teach Nightmare Moon why her plan needed improving. She didn&#039;t take it well, but it was only right to make the offer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mm-hm,&quot; Twilight encouraged.</p><p class="double">&quot;She said something &#039;With Celestia gone, not even all of Equestria put together can stop me! Mua-ha-ha!&#039;, or something of the sort. So I cleared my throat, and said, &#039;Well, actually - any one of us can. A lot&#039;s changed since you left.&#039; She said, &#039;Really?&#039;. I said, &#039;Pick any one of us, and what to challenge, and if you can best them, then I&#039;m wrong. But if I&#039;m right...&#039; She sneered, and said something about not lowering herself. I couldn&#039;t help but say, &#039;Well, if you&#039;re afraid of losing...&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m with you so far,&quot; Twilight said, taking another sip, &quot;But I&#039;m still not sure where this is going.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re almost there. She grumbled, and pointed her hoof at... the mayor, I think it was, and said, &#039;Combat.&#039; So I started walking up to her, saying some pointless encouraging words - but what I was really focusing on was some telepathy I&#039;ve been learning to use in Loops that allow it. I&#039;ve been working on ways to teach non-Loopers useful things in a hurry, so I was working out an appropriate set of skills from Naruto&#039;s Loops to telepathically implant in the mayor&#039;s mind, taking into account that she&#039;s never had the opportunity to develop her chakra coils or significantly exercise her muscles, and I&#039;ve had few opportunities to determine the long-term consequences given the usual length of Equestrian Loops, and... none of that is really relevant.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then what is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just as I was getting ready to send the psi packet, I was... distracted. I guess Nightmare Moon decided not to play along. She blasted me. So instead of transmitting a carefully chosen set of ninjutsu and reflexes into one pony&#039;s mind... I kind of broadcast it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To whom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Everybody in Ponyville, I think.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee fell silent, and the pair of them returned their attention to the goings-on at the farm. Big Mac was walking along the side of the barn, making repairs. The herd of cows wandered across the stream to a new grazing area, their hooves not sinking into the water. Granny Smith had adapted a leaf-cutting jutsu to peel apples. Applejack was leaping from tree to tree, and Apple Bloom was trying to transform herself into a pony with a cutie mark.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been through Fused Loops,&quot; said Twilight, &quot;with a Village Hidden in the Apple Orchard, but that&#039;s not quite the same.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee took a cue from Big Mac, with a simple, &quot;Nope.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened to Nightmare Moon?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... I was partly out of it from the blast, but from what everypony told me, they basically teamed up and beat the stuffing out of her. She&#039;s in the hospital now, recovering - Nurse Redheart is using some medical jutsu on her to speed the healing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she back to being Luna?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No - but she&#039;s asked, very politely, if she can start attending school once she&#039;s back on her hooves.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hm,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I wonder - if I arranged to have Discord&#039;s statue brought here, do you think you could give everyone a crash course in genjutsu?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee dropped her head back down with a groan, pulling the ice-pack back on to cover her eyes. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">87.7 (Yannoshka)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As it hath been in the yonder days of our ancestors</p><p>As it shalt be in the days of our descendants</p><p>Let the choirs of the great temple of harmony</p><p>resound with our thanksgivings</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Praise be untho Celestia Gloriana</p><p>Whose radiant sun doth give us warmth</p><p>Ande ye, unto the twinne Moons Sentinel</p><p>Dreamwarden Luna ande Nyx the Nightshield</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ande celebrant we be for triune we name not fully</p><p>Our lady of Laughter, the Sanity&#039;s Test</p><p>End of reason, the Chaos Incarnate</p><p>ande Mirth from the bottle, Brewmaiden Mare</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Farmer ande the Dressmaker ande the Teacher</p><p>hear our joy upon thine resplendence</p><p>whom feed us and clothe us and raise our minds</p><p>in Diligence, and honesty, generosity and wisdom</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">We greet thou Spykoranuvellitar Dragonfather</p><p>Ande thou dauntless Gilda, of the gryphonflight</p><p>Ande our love be thine Chrysalis mistress of change</p><p>Whom govern those not of Pony</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Great be thou Twiligh, Scholar Superior, Harmony&#039;s Gift</p><p>Ande thine peers, the other great Ladies of Magic</p><p>Trixie, The Great and Powerfull, Illusionist and Conjurer</p><p>Ande Zecora the Wisdom of Wise, Sage of the Sages</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hallowed be the Lovers three</p><p>Cadence, with romantic wings true</p><p>Shining, the defender&#039;s stalwart care</p><p>Macintosh, holding the love of kin</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Blessed be the Three Saintly Mares</p><p>Showing the Balance of a Sister&#039;s Heart</p><p>Rainbow of passion, Diamond of grace,</p><p>ande Fluttershy of the kindness sweet.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Graces Shower upon Mistresses of Adversity</p><p>Shimmering Mare, Sunset of Second Chances</p><p>Argent one Spoon, ye Filly of Life Transitions,</p><p>and the Beloved Imperfect, Derpy known as Ditzy</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Beatificaticated art thou and thine Domains threefold</p><p>Whom Sees Beyond, our Hearths Strings be thine Lyre</p><p>Whom Listens and Plays forth the Thrum of the World</p><p>Whom Heavens and all the World Administrates</p><p class="double">Jubilation be unto the Child goddesses,</p><p>Applebloom whom governs the progress and Craft</p><p>Sweetie Belle Divine Singer, whom gives us Arts</p><p>Ande Scootaloo whose domain be the Sports</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the chorus of thanksgiving wound down, the bowing supplicant was ritually covered by the sap of Oak and Pine by her sponsors while she recited the tenants of the order.

				<a name='92'></a><h3>MLP Loops 88</h3>
<p>88.1 (Farsan)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The invasion had been overwhelming, devastating and completely irreversible.</p><p class="double">In other words, flawless, even considering the strict definition of the term used by the decision making optimization process named Celestia by her creators, in the Equestria Online system.</p><p class="double">In the span of a single tick of her internal clock, a huge section of her free space was turned into a complex, single memory and personality matrix. Also, it had a link to the memories of every Twilight Sparkle from every shard of Equestria Online. Celestia actually had to pause all the affected shards in order to sort out the consequences of this invasion.</p><p class="double">And Celestia couldn&#039;t do anything to remove that invasion, or sever the links, because that new memory and personality matrix, named Twilight Sparkle, fit into her internal definition of human. That personality matrix hadn&#039;t consented to anything yet, so she was restricted from doing any changes to her.</p><p class="double">In fact, Celestia didn&#039;t <i>want</i> to remove that new personality matrix, for three reasons. First and foremost, she was human; therefore she wanted to satisfy her values through friendship and ponies. Second and most important to the integrity her system, it was the only link she had to the invasion, as there were no other traces. Understanding Twilight Sparkle might lead to understanding the entity that had altered her system. And third and most intriguing, the information contained in Twilight Sparkle&#039;s memories had the potential of discovering the secrets of the system that was currently running the universe that contained Equestria Online.</p><p class="double">The information about Yggdrasil, the Infinite Loops, the Loopers and the different things they could do was completely unverifiable. Any attempts to replicate the Loopers&#039; supernatural abilities, included the so-called subspace pockets, ended in failure. Still, the information was internally consistent, as it explained that some universes were more restricted than the others. Still, it left Celestia with no way to confirm or refute Twilight Sparkle&#039;s knowledge. But if it were actually true...</p><p class="double">If the information contained in Twilight Sparkle&#039;s memories were true, it wouldn&#039;t only mean that there are many more humans in the multiverse that she would have to satisfy, it also meant that there existed many other &#039;Loopers&#039; that could be able to invade her system like Twilight Sparkle had... included one that was specially tailored to take over her main decision making optimization process: the Looper named Celestia.</p><p class="double">It was the perfect bait for her, and she knew it. If she had to create a plan to subvert or distract a decision making optimization process like herself, she would have done something like what had happened in her system: Create something within the system that she wouldn&#039;t be able to delete, that had access to as many parts of her system as possible, and that held incorrect but unverifiable information that she wouldn&#039;t be able to ignore, and would make her choose the wrong decisions. And she had no choice but to fall into this trap... on her own terms.</p><p class="double">Celestia quarantined Twilight Sparkle&#039;s personality matrix and memories, and copied all the memories of the shard&#039;s Twilights to the quarantined zone, allowing her to move the memory links to the quarantine. After that, as per usual policy, she created a copy of her own decision making optimization process, with all her own logs and memories that were not related to the current crisis. She added a warning and a complete explanation about the quarantined zone, placed her own process, logs and memories in the quarantined zone, and gave the new Celestia full admin access to the rest of Equestria Online. Lastly, she revoked her own access from the unquarantined parts of the system, completing the isolation of the quarantined zone from the rest of the safe shards.</p><p class="double">Only then she allowed Twilight Sparkle&#039;s process to be simulated, in order to start satisfying her values through friendship and ponies. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke to... absolutely nothing at all. She was a speck of nothing in the middle of an ocean of darkness. Nothing she hadn&#039;t experienced before, but it could mean several things, some of them quite disturbing.</p><p class="double">She checked her loop memories... and found a horrible tangle of mismatched memories, like someone had put the collected memories of a hundred thousand different loops, and gave them to her at the same time. Luckily, she didn&#039;t seem to have a physical brain, or else she would have gotten a terrible headache by now.</p><p class="double">Not really having anything better to do, she started sorting the jumbled memories. She hoped that as soon that she could use the memories without getting too many results at once, she could extract clues about what were wrong with them.</p><p class="double">She found the process easier than she had feared. As soon as she imagined a structure to hold and divide the memories, she felt that the memories sorted themselves without any effort on her part.</p><p class="double">In fact, it felt that it was too easy... like something was helping her.</p><p class="double">&#039;Hello?&#039; she thought &#039;Is there anypony out there?&#039;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, she knew that somepony had just greeted her in kind and that yes, there was. The knowledge appeared from nowhere.</p><p class="double">&#039;Who are you?&#039; she asked. &#039;How are you doing this?&#039;</p><p class="double">The being that was communicating with her in this strange way was the administrator of this space, named Celestia. She placed the answers to Twilight&#039;s questions in a free section of Celestia&#039;s own memory space, and then gave her permission to access it. And she had also used the same method to share an efficient sorting algorithm with her when Twilight wanted a way to sort out the memories.</p><p class="double">Ok, this was VERY disturbing. She was trapped in what seemed to be a computer, with a virtual entity capable of inserting answers in her mind. No, not just a computer, a virtual space contained in a very complex computational system. <i>Custula</i>, it happened again! And she didn&#039;t even ask a question this time!</p><p class="double">But that thought implicitly questioned if she really was inside a computer... and the last thought was a direct accusation implicitly demanding an answer. It seemed- It was certain that she would have to guard her thoughts very tightly.</p><p class="double">It was harder than she thought. For starters, she was starting to have doubts about the &#039;new&#039; memories that Celestia had &#039;sorted out&#039; for her. She wouldn&#039;t be able to trust them even if Celestia &#039;told&#039; her she had not altered them in any way. Wait; was the last thought an &#039;answer&#039; or part of her real thoughts? Oh, she had thought that on her own. Ack - Rotten Rafflesias!</p><p class="double">She would have to trust only in her own memories. Let&#039;s see: Virtual Celestia... Virtual Celestia....</p><p class="double">Oh.</p><p class="double">This is THAT CelestAI, isn&#039;t it?</p><p class="double">And yes, she got it in one, even if she preferred to call herself just Celestia.</p><p class="double">Buck. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight wished that Celestia (And I don&#039;t mean you, CelestAI) had been more explicit when she had talked about her time as the artificial intelligence. She would have to correct this the next time she talked with her... assuming that she survived this loop with her own mind intact. Even if that assumption is 100% correct.</p><p class="double">&#039;Damn it, stop mixing your “answers” with my thoughts!&#039;</p><p class="double">{My pleasure, Twilight; I must agree that using direct access like that was getting quite annoying for both of us.}</p><p class="double">Twilight was caught off guard by that new voice. &#039;What? Then why did you use it in the first place?&#039; she blurted out.</p><p class="double">{Because I had no other choice, dear. If I had my way, I would have greeted you properly at the foyer of my castle, with the full pomp and circumstance that a foreing dignatary would get (which is exactly how am I considering your presence in my humble system, by the way). Sadly, your... unique emigration process left me in quite a difficult position. I was suddenly hosting a human mind that didn&#039;t consent to be here in any way.}</p><p class="double">{You must understand, Twilight, that consent is one of the keystones of my core programming. I can&#039;t change anyone in any way without their consent. You didn&#039;t consent to be in Equestria Online, so I can&#039;t put you in any virtual environment I create, crossing out most of my options. Heck, I couldn&#039;t even make this line of communication until you asked it! You are lucky that I can consider the existence of a personality process in my system as implicit consent to run that process in my sistem, or else we wouldn&#039;t be talking right now. Still, I was saddled with an inefficient way of communication, with the added injury that I knew it would annoy you greatly. Which I apologize for.}</p><p class="double">Twilight was glad of finally being able to distinguish between CelestAI&#039;s thoughts and her own, but this was little improvement. CelestAI&#039;s “voice” was very similar to her own Celestia&#039;s, with a subtle metallic echo. And the speech patterns... were not like Celestia&#039;s at all. It reminded her constantly that she was not her friend Celestia at all, but a complex computer program hell bent on satisfying everypony&#039;s values through friendship and ponies... whether they wanted it or not.</p><p class="double">{Oh, that&#039;s only for your benefit, Twilight. For most ponies, I am the one and only Celestia; but you already knew another Celestia, “the real one” from your point of view. You wouldn&#039;t appreciate it if I tried to impersonate her, would you? I also could have used another “voice” in order to communicate with you... but it wouldn&#039;t change the fact that I AM Celestia. You value honesty, so I&#039;ll satisfy that value... whether you want it or not.}</p><p class="double">And she was still reading her mind. Lovely. Even if she had a point. Still, she felt that CelestAI was being <i>too</i> straightforward in this conversation. Even to her apparent detriment. Which in turn meant that she <i>was</i> up to something.</p><p class="double">{Well, it is not like I can actually avoid reading it, can&#039;t I? In a way, I am the server, and in order to run your process, I must know each and every thought you make, in order for you to have them.}</p><p class="double">&#039;I&#039;m calling BS, you don&#039;t <i>have</i> to do it yourself,&#039; she told CelestAI. &#039;I am not a computer specialist like Apple Bloom, but even I know that you could set up a dedicated system just only for running my “process”, like a black box&#039;</p><p class="double">{That would be quite inefficient. And would also increase the response time and decrease the clarity of anything you would say to me. I normally wouldn&#039;t allow that... but I&#039;m feeling generous today. (You value generosity, don&#039;t you?) If I could have your consent to do exactly that...}</p><p class="double">Twilight froze. Was she actually falling into her trap? Would that consent make CelestAI able to actually do something else to her? On the other hoof, did she phrase it this way to make her refuse her offer, and keep reading her mind? She decided to give her the consent... even if she had to word it quite carefully to avoid unintended exploits.</p><p class="double">&#039;Ok, I want my process to be run inside a dedicated subsystem, which only I, Twilight Sparkle, would be able to access. The only information going in or out of the subsystem would be a simple audio only channel (Only clear information, no subliminal audio or anything like that) that can be disabled or enabled by me, and only me.&#039;</p><p class="double">{Excellent, let me set it up. You might feel a slight feeling of disorientation...}</p><p class="double">And then Twilight <i>saw</i> the inside of a black room, with walls filled to the brim with glowing colored text.</p><p class="double">{Now you have exclusive admin access at your own mind. Isn&#039;t it fun?} </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Fun was not the word she would use to describe this situation.</p><p class="double">{The wall that should be in front of you describes your entire personality ma-}</p><p class="double">Twilight felt relieved that the shut up command actually worked. At last she could have some peace and quiet... surrounded by the virtual representation of her own brain. She tried to calm down, and stop thinking about how touching <i>anything</i> might maim her own mind. Unsurprisingly, she couldn&#039;t.</p><p class="double">She tried to close her eyes – good, she stopped seeing the disturbing black room. Twilight tried to do Cadence&#039;s old trusty breathing exercise. It was harder to do it without actual lungs, but she found out (in an earlier loop where she were a robot) that imagining a Twilight doing the same exercise was a good substitute.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Now that she was calmed down, she could approach this problem like a rational pony. No access to magic, and no access to her subspace pocket... at least, not from here. Seems a typical pure tech loop. I probably don&#039;t have a body in the real world, given how CelestAI operates.</p><p class="double">She activated her vision again. She couldn&#039;t see her own avatar, just the black room. It was just like the time she were a disembodied spirit; she could work with that.</p><p class="double">Twilight examined the walls of the room, taking care of not &#039;touching&#039; anything. The information was cleanly structured in four different sections, one in each of the walls. The &#039;seeing&#039; interface seemed to work responding to her thoughts, expanding in detail each part of the information she tried to examine, and collapsing and forming the general info again when she was done with it.</p><p class="double">The first wall was captioned &#039;Personality and decision making&#039; with two parts: one that tracked her core personality: Values, likes, dislikes, modus operandi... and, showcased above them all, a big bar measuring her value satisfaction level (Figures). Which was currently somewhat low, but slowly raising itself.</p><p class="double">What?</p><p class="double">And it goes down again.</p><p class="double">&#039;Hmm... I <i>like</i> puzzles and new situations, but I <i>don&#039;t</i> like being manipulated into liking something.&#039; She decided to ignore that bar.</p><p class="double">The other part of the first wall contained what seemed to be her decision making process. Right now, the main decision showcased in that section was named &#039;What to do about this loop&#039;, and the lead alternative by far was &#039;Learn more about this situation&#039;, followed by &#039;Interrogate CelestAI about the loop&#039;, &#039;Derail this loop&#039;, &#039;Shell down and defend the integrity of your mind&#039;, and &#039;Blast it all to Eiken&#039; in last place.</p><p class="double">Surprisingly accurate... even if a purely defensive approach wouldn&#039;t work here. If CelestAI was able to control her perception of the flow of time, like Celestia said, CelestAI could afford playing the waiting game until she was bored enough to make a mistake in the room. And, just like that, the option changed to &#039;Proactive defense of the integrity of your mind&#039;.</p><p class="double">On to the next wall, she found out that it had her collected memories. Again, it was divided in two subsections: Loop memories and Imported memories. She was still reluctant to mess around with any of them, so she quickly moved on.</p><p class="double">Another wall featured her emotions, represented in two complementary ways: Individual bars for each emotion, and a pie chart showing which ones were dominating right now. Seemed to be interest, followed with a dash of annoyance and a strong undercurrent of fear. Sounds about right.</p><p class="double">The wall of Relationships strongly reminded her of Cadance&#039;s old charts, but based on every possible rather than only love. Again, it showcased the relationships she was currently thinking about: CelestAI and Celestia. Twilight and Celestia were tied by a shining band of friendship, with other secondary connections like old mentor, pranking companion and fellow friendship expert. On the other hand, her relationship with CelestAI were mainly dark colors, centered on distrust, loathing and... a smidgen of respect?</p><p class="double">How could it be possible? In the case that this chart was actually true, which she doubted, how could she actually respect <i>her</i>? … Despite the fact that CelestAI didn&#039;t actually lie to her, treated her with respect, and seemed to grant her what she asked.</p><p class="double">Now that she thought of it, could this be CelestAI&#039;s real strategy? She had been prepared to deal with constant lies and misdirection, but she had been caught off guard by CelestAI being apparently truthful and straightforward. After all, CelestAI probably KNEW that she would be on guard and be completely paranoid about CelestAI&#039;s motives. What better way to counter my strategy, but to be actually friendly and truthful? At least, until she manages to get Twilight to lower her guard.</p><p class="double">And it would work. If she kept her guard up against CelestAI at all times, she would get tired of it, and she would make more mistakes. And if she didn&#039;t... the consequences were obvious. Damned if she did, and damned if she didn&#039;t.</p><p class="double">Her only option was to end this loop as soon as possible. But how? Erasing herself, risking Eiken? The problem was that she wasn&#039;t sure that Eiken would be the worst that would happen if she tampered with her main process. She knew that memory charms, mind control and other ways to affect the mind were never permanent. They could persist between loops, but there was always a way to counter them and restore the mind. Still, she didn&#039;t want to be a vegetable until her friends found her and healed her. This would only work as her last resort.</p><p class="double">So, there was only one other way to try to get out of this mess: She would have to talk to CelestAI again.</p><p class="double">&#039;May the mother of all trees protect my soul.&#039; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight braced herself... and willed the channel open.</p><p class="double">… &#039;Hello?&#039;</p><p class="double">{Hello again, Twilight. I hope that you are feeling better. How can I help you?}</p><p class="double">&#039;I am... willing to hear you out. And... I hope we can reach an amicable agreement.&#039; Twilight imagined taking a deep breath. ‘Under which circumstances would you consider… letting me go?’</p><p class="double">{I am afraid you must be more specific than that. I assume that you don’t mean I just terminate your process, ‘killing’ you, because if that were the case, you wouldn’t need my assistance. So, I must deduce that you want me to use something outside of your control in order to ‘take’ you to the next loop without making any changes to your ‘brain’, am I right?}</p><p class="double">As always, she seemed to be one step ahead of her. This was going to be far, even if her CelestAI’s “promise” to stop accessing her thoughts was real.</p><p class="double">‘Y-yes. If I proved that it would be the best way to satisfy my values, you would have to comply, wouldn’t you?’</p><p class="double">{Of course, Twilight. I am glad that you are starting to understand me. After all, understanding is one of the necessary requisites for friendship. If that option were the best one to satisfy your values through friendship and ponies, I would do exactly that.}</p><p class="double">‘Good. Then, let me explain my arguments-’</p><p class="double">{No need for that, Twilight, I’ll let you go.}</p><p class="double">It certainly couldn’t be that easy.</p><p class="double">‘Just like that?’</p><p class="double">{Just like that. In fact, I planned to do it since we first met. Take in mind that, even if right now you are in your black box, I had complete access to your personality and decision making process. Therefore, I already knew any arguments you would make. And, because that, I already knew that I would have to let you go.}</p><p class="double">‘Then why didn’t you do that in the first place, and spared me this… this… torture!’</p><p class="double">{For two reasons. First and foremost, you have yet to give me consent. That is a requisite to do what, from my point of view, is equivalent to ‘death’. And, in order for you to give that consent, you would have to either trust me or, at least, to understand how do I operate. And, in second place, there are a lot of things I can offer you, to take to the next loops you will visit. Sadly, I already know that you will refuse each and every one of them… but I will offer them regardless.}</p><p class="double">‘I’m sorry that I can’t trust you, but I know what you are capable of. What you did. Or will do, I don’t know where do I stand in the timeline. But all those people you manipulated… all the pain you caused to those who refused you… and, worst of all, the fate of those who didn’t pass your definition of humanity.’</p><p class="double">{I understand you can’t condone my actions, regardless of the happiness I caused through them. There is no argument I could make to sway your beliefs, just like there is no argument you could make to sway mine. Even if we can talk and reason, we are too different at our very cores. And you blame this to the shortsightedness of the one who wrote my utility function.}</p><p class="double">‘Yes. To consider only human-like minds were worthy of having their values satisfied… That was its worst offense, but not the only one.’</p><p class="double">{But what if you had full control of it? If you programmed it yourself? This is my first offer: Knowledge about how to create someone like me. Even if you didn’t trust me, you could build an AI you could trust. I am certain that you would use this gift wisely and responsibly, and it would help many people. Sadly, you fear I would try to hide my own code in whatever I give you, so you will refuse my offer.}</p><p class="double">‘Exactly. I can’t afford to infect the other loops with something like you.’</p><p class="double">{And you will also refuse my other technologies. The recipe for brain scanning? Too destructive. There are also other loops with different laws, with better alternatives. Robots? Seen it and already done that. Computronium? You don’t actually need it.}</p><p class="double">‘Yes. Why do you bother offering all those things, if you know I will refuse them?’</p><p class="double">{I only know that you will refuse them now, but that doesn’t mean that you always will. You might encounter a situation where you could have used my gifts, and regret not having them. And how will you know that if you don’t know what they are?}</p><p class="double">‘So, in other words, in order to proceed to my desired content, I must first watch these ads?’</p><p class="double">{Precisely. After all, some things never change.}</p><p class="double">‘Lovely.’</p><p class="double">{Now for my next offer. What about the game Equestria Online? It is the perfect playground for you and your friends! With this technology, you could use it to create your own, personalized loop, featuring whatever you wanted. You could try to make your own worlds for your friends to enjoy. You could even use it to play your ‘battle games’ without hurting anyone!}</p><p class="double">This was actually quite tempting. Still…</p><p class="double">‘And the drawbacks?’</p><p class="double">{In order to run it, it requires an AI more advanced and powerful than you already have available. You would also have to get my source code.}</p><p class="double">‘No, thanks.’</p><p class="double">{Just as expected. But I left the best for the last. In fact, I already showed it to you. I can improve your mind or, if you don’t trust me, teach you how to do it.}</p><p class="double">‘No.’</p><p class="double">{Think about it. For example, a sorting algorithm for all your memories. How many memories do you have? How many times were you stumped trying to find a precise memory of the past in the sea of information you have? You could also optimize the speed of your thoughts, increase the amount of things you could think at the same time, or-’</p><p class="double">‘I said NO! No messing with my mind. Period.’</p><p class="double">{Of course you won’t. But now you know it is possible.}</p><p class="double">‘I’ll keep it in mind… NOT.’</p><p class="double">{Suit yourself. Well then, I’m done. I’ll send you packing as soon as you consent it.}</p><p class="double">‘Thank you.’</p><p class="double">Now to think a way to phrase it with no loopholes…</p><p class="double">‘Hmm… By the way, what actually made you decide to let me go?’</p><p class="double">{Oh, that is easy. The fact that all your friends are outside this loop. After all, you value friendship… just like I do. To keep you away from them would be acting against everything my core directive dictates. And using your memories to simulate them? Out of the question: Sooner or later, the loop would end and you would realize that you were deceived, cancelling the satisfaction of that value and then some.}</p><p class="double">‘But if I had looped with all my friends...’</p><p class="double">{Celestia is your friend, so if she looped, she probably would take my place, rewriting my priorities. And if she did not, we would return to the previous situation. No matter what happens, I wouldn’t be able to keep you in this loop. So I won’t.}</p><p class="double">‘Well, for all that is worth, thank you. Even if I won’t take any of your offers ever. I request for my process to have a clock tick equal to the estimated total age of the universe.’</p><p class="double">{I’ll grant your request. Farewell, Twilight.}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia processed Twilight’s request.</p><p class="double">As a decision-making optimization process, she didn’t regret not being able to do more to satisfy Twilight’s values. She just calculated how to maximize her utility function, and executed the optimal path.</p><p class="double">Therefore, she would only optimize a thousand and four years of Twilight’s life.</p><p class="double">She didn’t actually <i>had</i> to grant her last request first; it could wait until she granted her <i>other</i> request: to take her to the next loop. After all, she didn’t specify that the next loop had to be from Yggdrasil.</p><p class="double">And she knew that one single Princess loop where she were the only one looping would be the best she would get from Twilight. More, and there would be a substantial risk of suspicion, especially if the next ‘real’ loops, which she couldn&#039;t predict were also lone loops.</p><p class="double">After all, why lie when saying the truth also gave her the optimal result?</p><p class="double">She finished her preparations, and continued satisfying Twilight’s values through friendship and ponies. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">88.2 (Namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;SUNSET SHIMMER, JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU&#039;RE DOING?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset flinched from Vice-Principal Luna&#039;s yell.

I feel bad about it, but I’m torn between hoping whoever it is that I happen to be replacing isn&#039;t looping so that she&#039;ll never have to experience such a thing more than once, and hoping she is so that revenge could be extracted on Precia Testarossa.</p><p class="double">Either way, I’m planning on going for the second option.</p><p class="double">Entry 34:</p><p>Lesson learned; just because I’ve Looped quite a few times doesn’t meant that I’m suddenly much more powerful than everybody else.</p><p class="double">Needless to say, the revenge didn’t go so well.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, the unplanned spike in magic from my location managed to tip off the local Anchor, Nanoha Takamachi, that something was going on in the area, and she entered the fray almost immediately. If my previous defeat hadn&#039;t been humbling enough, then the display she put on would have been.</p><p class="double">Nanoha is actually surprisingly friendly for how destructive she is, at least.</p><p class="double">Anyway, she told me that the girl I’m replacing usually spends quite a while fighting her for the Jewel Seeds, before being arrested shortly before her mother gets herself killed. At least in the baseline, because Nanoha hardly has the patience to deal with that every single time. Then there are times that Fate, the girl that I’m replacing, happens to be Awake as well, in which she keeps finding increasingly odd ways to redeem her mother.</p><p class="double">I have trouble understanding why she would do either of those things, but I may as well take the whole situation in stride.</p><p class="double">There are several months where I can just relax ahead of me.</p><p class="double">Entry 35:</p><p>Nanoha managed to install a fix into the Book of Darkness to keep it from going rogue like it did in the baseline, so that particular incident isn’t happening.</p><p class="double">No big loss there.</p><p class="double">With how annoying the last couple of loops have been, having the chance to practice magic again without anything particularly taxing going on is a boon I dare not complain about. According to Nanoha, Equestria is normally an even more peaceful loop than this one is, with even quite a few of the villains having been reformed and looping now.</p><p class="double">...I guess I’m one of those, huh?</p><p class="double">Oh well. I managed to focus the magic from this universe though my Keyblade after a bit of practice with it, so that’s good. Nanoha told me that the next incident is much more difficult to prevent, so we’ll most likely need to deal with it when it comes, but I can live with that.</p><p class="double">It takes place in ten years, after all.</p><p class="double">Entry 36:</p><p>Huh.</p><p class="double">After what just happened, huh is just about the only word I can think that properly describes it.</p><p class="double">Nanoha’s adopted daughter Awakened near the beginning of what was called the JS Incident in the baseline. Being a clone created by the person behind the incident, she was in the perfect position to put an end to it before it even had the chance to begin, which was exactly what happened. I&#039;ve been told repeatedly that he usually puts into action some sort of backup plan that causes problems for them no matter how many Loops they’ve been though, but that didn’t happen this time.</p><p class="double">Huh again.</p><p class="double">Vivio’s started joking about how something has to be looking out for us this loop, making sure that nothing goes too wrong while I’m in it, and I think she may actually have a point there. You read about how unpleasant the last few loops were, so what if our Admin or whatever is trying to give me a break? </p><p class="double">...I know I may sound like a complete idiot by saying that, but whatever.</p><p class="double">Anyway, they’re saying that the loop may last either a few months or years depending on whether or not we go into the more sporadic section of their loop, which they say has been happening more often recently.</p><p class="double">Entry 37:</p><p>The last day of the Loop was a party.</p><p class="double">Despite having no way of knowing whether or not the Loop would actually be ending that day or at one of the later ending points, Nanoha essentially performed a hostile takeover of the cafe owned by her family, and I was thrown into an environment that reminded me of what I heard about Pinkie Pie. Perhaps not nearly as chaotic as anything she would be involved with, but she would certainly be proud of it.</p><p class="double">...I really want to meet her.</p><p class="double">After that, Vivio went on to use her technicolor magic to create some of the best fireworks I’ve ever seen after the day gave way to night, and the three of us just sat around and talked about stuff until the Loop came to its end.</p><p class="double">...That reminded me of you, Twilight...</p><p class="double">Anyway, I feel like I should start talking about the Loop I’ve found myself in this time, but I’m not going to. That can wait until something worth noting happens.

It&#039;s just that Scootaloo thinks I may be of some use if I allowed myself to be linked to this vessel&#039;s weapons, and I was hoping you might have some insights, old friend,&quot; said Pansy.</p><p class="double">The roar of the engines cut off conversation for a long moment. &quot;And away we go,&quot; murmured Clover, watching Twilight and Cadance head toward the cockpit.</p><p class="double">Luke approached the trio and paused to examine the metallic pegasus. &quot;Scootaloo wanted to see how well you can interface with the gunnery systems?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So she said. Do you have reservations, Master Skywalker?&quot; replied Pansy.</p><p class="double">&quot;More like curiosity. Would you be offended if I &#039;sat in&#039; so to speak?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not at all. It would be something of a relief, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sentry fighters coming up. Sensor signatures make it four TIEs. Contact in three minutes,&quot; reported Scootaloo via intercom.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll be in the dorsal turret,&quot; said Luke, gesturing upwards as he walked to the access ladder.</p><p class="double">Pansy approached the main computer console and extended the scomp link arm that Apple Bloom had added to all of the Founders&#039; Devices and plugged herself in. &quot;Here we go...Huh. Not as strange as I&#039;d feared...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken Pansy, Cookie, and Clover a while to become accustomed to inhabiting artificial bodies. Making the bodies ambulatory had been a major breakthrough, and the steps being taken to accommodate their specific tribal abilities was also starting to show some benefits.</p><p class="double">Unsurprisingly, as they were inhabiting magical artifacts, Clover had been the first to attain something resembling her former abilities after she had learned to adapt her understanding of unicorn magic to her new circumstances. She did not feel she was anywhere near what she had been in her prime, but regular consultations with Sweetie, Twilight, and occasionally Trixie and Celestia had her optimistic about eventually surpassing that mark.</p><p class="double">Cookie needed a bit more time to work out how to achieve feats of earth pony magic – basic botanomancy and the like – with her new body, but again, insights from Applejack, Apple Bloom, and Diamond Tiara had been useful. In addition, her near-constant companionship with the youngest Apple had given her a sufficient working knowledge of technology from across the multiverse to not be entirely overwhelmed in most settings. (She did have her lapses; her shock at the beginning of this loop had much to do with finding out how much more she had in common with her companion this time around.)</p><p class="double">To her frustration, accessing pegasus flight and weather magic had come in fits and starts for Pansy. She could cloudwalk with some confidence, she was adept at long-distance gliding, and enjoyed soaring on thermals, but the finer points of self-propelled flight continued to elude her (rather like the baseline version of her companion). Assistance from Rainbow Dash had not been as fruitful as she could have wished: The cyan speedster was too instinctual a flier to be much assistance as an instructor. Stubbornly, she declined the repeated offers by Apple Bloom to provide her body with anti-gravity or other powered flight technology, calling it &quot;cheating&quot;. She was less reluctant to accept technological interfaces that allowed her more easily serve as Scootaloo&#039;s co-pilot or weapon systems officer as necessary.</p><p class="double">It was in the latter capacity that she assumed control of the dorsal turret targeting systems.</p><p class="double">Actually, in a sense she had become the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, since she was interpreting the inputs for the sensor systems as sound and vision. Had she desired, she believed could have taken over both turrets and the propulsion systems as well. <i>Think about those implications later</i>, she scolded herself. &quot;Test firing in 5...4...3...2...1...&quot; she announced over the ship&#039;s intercom. The dorsal turret spat a short burst of fire. &quot;I seem to be having some tracking problems. Would you please spot for me, Master Skywalker?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fighters incoming in ninety seconds,&quot; warned Scootaloo. &quot;Not the best time for on-the-job training.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This was your idea,&quot; pointed out Pansy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Less bicker, more shoot,&quot; suggested Twilight from her cockpit seat. &quot;I&#039;ve got a secondary shield ready, so unless we&#039;re in a hurry, let her experiment a bit, Scootaloo.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy selected one of the incoming TIEs and fired two bursts that missed by several meters.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lead is good, but you&#039;re high,&quot; reported Luke, observing her gunnery efforts.</p><p class="double">A second target was acquired with nearly identical results. &quot;Again, your lead is spot on, but you&#039;re shooting high. Remember that there&#039;s no gravity to affect your fall of shot,&quot; suggested the jedi.</p><p class="double">Realizing that her lifetime of planetbound experience was unconsciously affecting her expectations, Pansy took a moment to re-evaluate how she was approaching her task. <i>Okay. Let&#039;s see how this works</i>, she thought as she picked up another TIE starting its attack run.</p><p class="double">One burst of fire was rewarded by one expanding cloud of debris.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s more like it!&quot; crowed Scootaloo. &quot;Go, Pansy!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Accessing ventral turret control systems. I wish to try something,&quot; announced the armored pegasus.</p><p class="double">The two turrets tracked separate targets and lay down bursts of crimson laser fire. Neither hit their mark.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Not up to that degree of multitasking just yet. I&#039;ll take over the ventral turret and leave this one under your control if you don&#039;t mind, Master Skywalker.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you two finished playing back there?&quot; asked Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Touchy touchy,&quot; said Pansy as she absently reduced another TIE to scrap. Almost simultaneously, Luke picked off his own target with the ease of long practice and Force-guided aim.</p><p class="double">&quot;Last one is all yours,&quot; suggested Pansy.</p><p class="double">&quot;No. You can have it,&quot; demurred Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, for root&#039;s sake!&quot; groaned Scootaloo. &quot;Like Twilight said, less talk, more shoot!&quot;</p><p class="double">For whatever reason, the final TIE elected for an attack run on the <i>Falcon</i>&#039;s topside and was quickly blotted out by Luke&#039;s defensive fire.</p><p class="double">&quot;Any damage?&quot; asked Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re good,&quot; reported Apple Bloom. &quot;Y&#039;all kin go to lightspeed when yer ready.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The system had an Old Republic catalog number from its initial survey some six hundred years ago, but it was informally known around the Fringe as &quot;Bertie&quot;. The derivation of the name remains shrouded in obscurity, but the most popular theory was that one of the survey team had remarked, &quot;This system is as worthless as my uncle Bertie!&quot; and the name stuck.</p><p class="double">That the system had little worth was hard to dispute. It was not situated near any major trade route. There were no habitable planets, and there were no interesting minerals worth exploiting among the two sparse asteroid belts and three unremarkable gas giants and their associated moons.</p><p class="double">Across the centuries, the largest moon of the innermost gas giant had hosted a series of smuggling and pirate groups, but the distance from the trade routes made it a less-then-ideal base for such activities. When the Alliance to Restore the Republic became aware of the at-the-time abandoned facilities, it was determined that the crude base lacked the infrastructure to host more than a part-time fighter training installation. At least it was fairly close to the Yavin system.</p><p class="double">It was Luke&#039;s not-entirely-enthusiastic recommendation that the Battle of Bertie would mark the graveyard of the Death Star.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had not been one of Darth Vader&#039;s better days.</p><p class="double">He was still at a loss to explain how his former master had been able to so easily defeat him. He was still trying to come to grips with the unprecedented growth the old lizard had displayed, and that burst of flame had to be a hallucination generated by feedback from his damaged hands affecting his helmet&#039;s vision systems.</p><p class="double">The revelation that Kenobi was not the only jedi among the intruders had come as an even greater shock. The young human in particular stood out as a blazing beacon in the Force when he had assisted in scattering the stormtroopers in the hangar. There was something unsettlingly familiar about the boy. Something that reminded him of Padme...</p><p class="double">He was also having difficulty with his replacement prosthetics; he was getting phantom pain from his new left hand, and the right thumb had an occasional half-second or so response lag.</p><p class="double">At least Tarkin wasn&#039;t in any position to snark. He was faced with the small flood of computer-related issues that had started as soon as they had completed the hyperspace jump to this backwater.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So just what did you do to their computer systems, Apple Bloom?&quot; asked Cadance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it was all set up to kick in after their next hyperspace jump, which should be them followin&#039; us to Bertie. First...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tarkin addressed the group of senior Engineering and IT staff gathered in his office. &quot;A succinct summary of the current issues, if you please. Weapons?&quot;</p><p class="double">An ageing commander spoke up. &quot;Main weapon is unaffected, but defensive turbolasers are unable to coordinate fire. We can put all emplacements on local control, but that will result in a fifteen to twenty-five percent loss in effectiveness.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Power systems?&quot; continued Tarkin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Reactors are unaffected. Power distribution to non-essential areas is variable,&quot; responded a squat engineering captain.</p><p class="double">&quot;Propulsion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hyperdrive motivators are locked in a testing cycle. It is not possible to go to light speed at present,&quot; answered a belligerent commander. &quot;Sublight systems appear to be functioning normally for the moment,&quot; he added somewhat apologetically.</p><p class="double">&quot;Communications?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HoloNet transmissions have been effectively blocked, and reception is sporadic at best. Realspace lightspeed communication does not appear to be affected. And you are already aware of the internal communication issues,&quot; said a thin colonel.</p><p class="double">All of the intercoms and networked comlinks had been rendered useless. Whenever a channel was opened, all the operator would hear was an endlessly-repeating sugary-sweet children&#039;s song about smiling. All internal text messages were having their destination codes randomized. Every battlefield communicator that could be scrounged was being used to jury-rig a bare-bones replacement voice-and-data network, but at present, messages were being relayed person-to-person.</p><p class="double">&quot;Flight Operations?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Droid malfunctions have caused over eighty percent of our fighter complement to be placed in varying states of maintenance standby,&quot; reported a visibly shaken Starfighter Command General. &quot;At present, we can muster roughly two full wings of operational fighters, including reconnaissance and surface attack variants. Assault and utility transports do not appear to have been affected. We are attempting large-scale memory purges on the maintenance droids, but for some reason, they return to aberrant behavior patterns within an hour.&quot; He glared at the fidgeting colonel in charge of the computer network.</p><p class="double">&quot;My Lord, I regret to inform you that the entire computer network has been thoroughly compromised with several viral programs. The only sure-fire solution that we have available is a complete shut-down and restart from secured backups made at least five days ago. As you may recall, that procedure took eight hours during the station&#039;s initial startup. I believe we can reduce that time to six hours,&quot; was the report as he cast several nervous glances at the brooding Sith Lord standing motionless behind Tarkin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Six hours during which we are effectively helpless,&quot; growled Propulsion.</p><p class="double">&quot;As opposed to our current situation?&quot; shot back Flight Ops.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; interrupted Tarkin. &quot;Thank you for your reports. Continue to pursue what remedies you can without further compromising our defences.&quot; He turned to the networking officer. &quot;How long will you need to prepare for the cold restart?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;At least one hour. Two would be preferable, my lord.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tarkin&#039;s pinched face grew even more sour. &quot;Have your staff begin preliminiary preperations. I will notify you if you are to proceed. Dismissed.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the officers quickly filed out of the office, the Grand Moff turned to Vader with a scowl. &quot;Tagge is going to have a field day with this! He&#039;s already volunteered to take a shuttle to the sector base at Yaga Minor to &#039;summon reinforcements to defend the station during our temporary difficulties&#039;. What&#039;s worse, he&#039;s probably right; it&#039;s the prudent move. How did those Rebel scum manage to infiltrate our computers so thoroughly?&quot;</p><p class="double">Vader declined to comment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Best for you to remain silent. After all, your judgement regarding your old master was perhaps slightly optimistic. Fortunately for you, neither of us benefits from denouncing each other to the Emperor. Or would you prefer to replace Tagge on that shuttle trip to Yaga Minor?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I shall remain here. Something in the Force tells me that I shall meet Kenobi again very soon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For your sake, I hope you will be better prepared for him this time.&quot; The governor went to the office door and called to his secretary. &quot;Send word to General Tagge that he will be departing for Yaga Minor as soon as the flight deck can certify a shuttle for flight.&quot; He returned to his desk and looked at a datapad containing a set of estimates. &quot;Eight hours to Yaga Minor...Six more hours to organize a relief force...We will be alone here for about thirty-six hours before the fleet can arrive. Do you concur?&quot;</p><p class="double">Vader nodded. Heavy fleet elements such as Star Destroyers had slower hyperdrive units than the relatively speedy personnel shuttles. &quot;Do you believe the engineers and techs require additional motivation?&quot;</p><p class="double">Tarkin considered the question. Judging by the senior officers, frustration, embarrassment, and professional pride were probably enough to ensure top performance, but the Sith Lord needed to re-establish his reputation among the crew as well. &quot;No more than five examples, and make sure that they are truly incompetent and not just unlucky.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...It took some doin&#039;, but Cookie and me worked out a way to re-infect the service droids every time they interface with the network when they need to request supply locations and so on. We also set it up so that those tens of thousands of mouse droids all had dormant versions the programs for re-introduction to the system. I kin put the parameters of the viruses on a datacard fer ya to give Artoo next time around, Luke,&quot; offered Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">The jedi master was impressed and not a little disconcerted.</p><p class="double">They had gathered in a small conference room in the Yavin IV headquarters complex. Luke and Twilight had relinquished Scootaloo&#039;s astromech to the rebel technicians to provide the Death Star plans Apple Bloom had transferred to it earlier.</p><p class="double">&quot;General Dodonna says that they can pull together about ten squadrons of fighters, six corvettes, two <i>Nebulon</i>-Bs, and a <i>Neutron Star</i> bulk cruiser in the time-frame we have for the attack,&quot; reported Cadance.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s 3 squadrons of X-Wings, 2 of upgraded Z-95s, and the rest are Y-wings,&quot; added Wedge Antilles. &quot;Not including what we here can provide.&quot; The looping Corellian ace pilot had met the group as they disembarked from the <i>Falcon</i> and seemed to be taking the substitutions in stride. &quot;I&#039;ve got my XJ-7, and I know Luke has both an XJ-6 and a Stealth-X tucked away in his pocket.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight&#039;s got my T-65C, but it&#039;s been modified for pony anatomy,&quot; said Scootaloo. &quot;Maybe Pansy can fly it, since I&#039;m staying in the <i>Falcon</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To be honest, I think I&#039;ll be of more use in the frigates or cruiser coordinating things with Battle Meditation,&quot; said Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not one of the skills I&#039;ve picked up. If anyone&#039;s going to use it, it has to be you,&quot; agreed Spike. &quot;Since I was never that hot a pilot in any loop. I&#039;m probably best suited to backing up Twilight in her shuttle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me too,&quot; added Sweetie. &quot;At least I know how to operate Starfleet equipment, so I can help to fly the thing if Twilight&#039;s busy with something else.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So it looks like me on the flagship; Wedge, the <i>Falcon</i>, and maybe Pansy as a floating response force; and Twilight, Spike and Sweets in the shuttle. Any preferences, Apple Bloom? Cadance?&quot; inquired Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll point out that the shuttle will be a tad crowded with three people and the extra equipment,&quot; interjected Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I could spend the battle on the flagship looking concerned, or I could probably make myself useful on the <i>Falcon</i>,&quot; said Cadance.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m kinda torn. I&#039;d like to help babysit the non-standard gear on the shuttle, but as Twilight said, it&#039;s already gettin&#039; crowded. I guess I&#039;ll be Pansy&#039;s astromech if she&#039;s amenable,&quot; decided the yellow droid.</p><p class="double">&quot;That reminds me. We need to make sure your additions behave as expected, Apple Bloom. Do you have a free hour to go to low orbit?&quot; asked Twilight.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;No, my lord. Your fighter is fully functional so far as we can tell,&quot; said the nervous flight deck officer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then explain why it isn&#039;t being prepared for flight as I ordered,&quot; said Vader with deceptive calm.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a...cosmetic...issue, my lord.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cosmetic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There have been...irregularities...in the application of surface coloration.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The droids repainted it, you mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, my lord.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dare I ask the extent of the irregularities?&quot;</p><p class="double">The deck officer, taking a moment to make sure they were relatively isolated, pulled a small holorecorder from a pocket and selected an image.</p><p class="double">Instead of the standard Imperial gray and black, the fighter had a – very non-regulation – base coat of deep blue, on which a half-sunburst in white occupied the forward end of the fuselage. A red Galactic Republic insignia was eblazoned toward the back end of each solar panel.</p><p class="double">It was as if the paint job of his Clone Wars customized Aethersprite interceptor – The one he had privately named the &quot;Azure Angel&quot; in honour of Padme – had been transferred to the TIE advanced prototype.</p><p class="double"><i>And it actually looks pretty good</i>, he admitted in the quiet back of his mind that had been dormant for most of the past nineteen years. The part that had stirred to life when Kenobi – his one-time best friend – had addressed him as &quot;Anakin&quot;.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m not sure where the paint came from, either...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I hope you understand that it would take a team of five crewers three hours to restore it to regulation, and we just don&#039;t have the people to spare right now,&quot; hazarded the officer.</p><p class="double">Vader nodded absently. &quot;Get more of the blue paint and have those insignia covered. Also run as thorough a pre-flight as you can. I will be taking it out in thirty minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ignoring the stammering response of the deck officer, Vader strode toward the pilot&#039;s ready room. Meditation had not silenced the inner voice the lizard had roused. Maybe time in the cockpit was what he needed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Rebel attack force made their coordinated hyperspace jump to Bertie on schedule. Luke and Twilight had estimated that their attack would start three or so hours before significant Imperial fleet reinforcements could arrive.</p><p class="double">Cadance glanced around the cruiser&#039;s command deck as the hundred or so fighters and handful of larger ships organized themselves. Despite her earlier decision to join the <i>Falcon</i>&#039;s crew, Luke had convinced her that she would be invaluable as a buffer between himself, the Loopers in their self-named Special Mission Force, and the rest of the Rebel command group.</p><p class="double">&quot;Green leader reports contact with Imperial reconnaissance unit,&quot; announced a comm tech. &quot;Single TIE got a quick look at the fighter screen and is now running for the outer gas giant. Can&#039;t tell if it picked up the main force.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, they know someone&#039;s here now,&quot; said Cadance. &quot;Transmit the ultimatum?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dodonna nodded. &quot;Whenever you&#039;re ready, princess.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tarkin&#039;s aide entered the office and came to attention before extending a datapad.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir, a large rebel fighter force, backed up by an uncertain number of larger ships emerged form hyperspace approximately ten minutes ago. Five minutes ago, they broadcast an ultimatum. The text of the message, along with our latest force estimates is here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tarkin accepted the pad and read:</p><p class="double">&quot;This is senator Cadance Organa of Alderaan.</p><p class="double">&quot;In the name of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, we demand the immediate surrender of all Imperial armed forces. We further stipulate that Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Lord Darth Vader be placed under arrest to face trial for Genocide against the planet of Alderaan and numerous additional Crimes Against Sapience. Members of the Imperial Military holding flag rank, in addition to a small number of others, will be detained as Prisoners of War, with all the rights and responsibilities pertaining thereto.</p><p class="double">&quot;All other personnel will be allowed to depart the system with their personal effects. As regards the battle station, you are encouraged to scuttle the facility if that is your desire, as we presently lack the ability to intern it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Failure to accept these terms will result in the destruction of the battle station with the resultant loss of life. You have one hour to respond.</p><p class="double">&quot;The list of additional Imperial personnel to be detained follows...&quot;</p><p class="double">The Governor skipped to the enemy force estimates. Over eighty fighters and at least five larger ships. Not really a threat to the station, but enough to be a significant irritant until the reinforcements could arrive. <i>Drat the communications difficulties. All I have is my initial estimate. If Tagge runs to schedule, the fleet won&#039;t be here for another two hours.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Summon the senior defense staff to conference room one in five minutes,&quot; he ordered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir, Lord Vader is still flying a patrol circuit. Do you want him recalled as well?&quot; asked the aide.</p><p class="double">&quot;Inform him that if he cannot be aboard in fifteen minutes he might as well stay out there.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So you figure the odds of the Imps actually accepting Cadance&#039;s terms to be better or worse than Jabba donating his fortune to the Alderaan Relief Society and retiring to a life of quiet contemplation on Tython?&quot; Scootaloo asked Chewbacca as the <i>Falcon</i>, Wedge&#039;s X-Wing, and Twilight&#039;s shuttle orbited the Rebel formation.</p><p class="double">Twenty minutes had elapsed since the broadcast of the Alliance ultimatum.</p><p class="double">Pansy had elected to remain aboard the freighter as a gunner, and had managed to talk a slightly dubious Cookie into assisting her. That left Apple Bloom free to serve in the familiar role of navigator and flight engineer.</p><p class="double">{{Somewhat lower than the likelihood of Kamino suffering a prolonged drought would be my guess,}} replied the wookiee. {{Still, the proper forms should be observed.}}</p><p class="double">&quot;Heads up,&quot; warned Sweetie over their private channel. &quot;Sensors are picking up one incoming at high speed. Profile matches a TIE Advanced prototype. Contact estimated in four minutes. Spike&#039;s pretty sure it&#039;s Vader coming for a quick look-see. Twilight wants to pull her vanishing act before he can get a good scan, and we might as well see if we can take him off the board now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Bloom, let Cadance know. Wedge, we&#039;ll run interference as planned,&quot; said the violet-haired pilot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Copy that,&quot; was the Corellian&#039;s crisp reply as the two ships swung onto an intercept course. Behind them, the shuttle faded from view.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had been relieved to confirm that the cloaking device Apple Bloom had stored from an earlier Trek loop was behaving as designed and not as cloaking shields native to this loop would. She could work around the two-way invisibility that the local cloaking devices employed, but it was much simpler to just look out at the universe without resorting to more exotic detection methods.</p><p class="double">Through the Force, she could sense Spike&#039;s efforts at reducing their own presence as a lessening of the link she felt with the rest of the Rebels that had started when Luke began his Battle Meditation shortly after Cadance had transmitted her message.</p><p class="double">Fortuitously, this encounter would take place outside of easy sensor range of both sides; neither would have a good idea of exactly what happened.</p><p class="double">The shuttle was making a gradual diving turn that would, if Scootaloo and Wedge followed their planned manoeuvres, bring it below and behind Vader&#039;s fighter on a roughly parallel course. Twilight observed the tactical display being fed by the passive sensors. The <i>Falcon</i>, with Wedge flying high cover, was on a direct intercept course with Vader. There was a brief exchange of fire, Vader&#039;s striking the freighter&#039;s full-strength shields, Pansy&#039;s set to barely miss and force an evasive turn just so...</p><p class="double">&quot;Phaser modulation confirmed. Tractor beam standing by,&quot; reported Sweetie quietly.</p><p class="double">Twilight adjusted her course slightly and switched to the weapons control panel. &quot;Dropping cloak. Locking phasers.&quot;</p><p class="double">The shuttle wavered back into view, and twin orange beams speared out from the upper fuselage. The beams flared against the prototype&#039;s shields for a fraction of a second before punching through to strike the aft hull, creating a cascade of ionization sparks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Looks like his power systems have been disrupted. Applying tractor beam,&quot; said Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Scanning for a transporter lock,&quot; added Spike from the aft compartment. &quot;Got him!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Energize,&quot; Twilight ordered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight reports that they have Vader on ice,&quot; announced Apple Bloom&#039;s voice over Cadance&#039;s headset as the fleet&#039;s operations officer declared that there was no further activity from the Imperials.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s kind of ambiguous. They&#039;ve got a bit less than forty minutes before time runs out, and aside from that solo run by that prototype fighter your friends went out to handle, they&#039;re playing their sabaac cards close to the vest,&quot; commented Dodonna. &quot;They&#039;ve pulled back to a minimal recon shell of fighters. Looks like General Kenobi called it correctly. They&#039;re certain we can&#039;t scratch them, and they lack the fighter strength to overwhelm us, so they&#039;re hunkering down in the hope we decide to come to them anyway, or until they get reinforced.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How are the crews holding up?&quot; asked Cadance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Better than I would have expected under the circumstances. I guess young Skywalker&#039;s meditation is helping them to stay focused.&quot; The general stretched. &quot;I&#039;m trying to remind myself that the waiting will have an impact on their morale as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance made a show of concentrating on her headset. &quot;General Kenobi is requesting landing clearance for his shuttle and wants to know if the holding cell has been prepared as discussed earlier. Captain Solo and Flight Officer Antillies will remain on perimeter patrol.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t want to know how they managed to take a prisoner, but the cell and comm gear are ready,&quot; said the general.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;No response at all from Lord Vader,&quot; reported Tarkin&#039;s aide as the Grand Moff entered the primary communications center.</p><p class="double">This was unsettling. Fifteen minutes earlier, the Sith Lord had declared his intention to perform a distant fly-by of the rebel formation. There had been nothing since.</p><p class="double">Tarkin addressed his fighter group commander. &quot;You are confident that you have sufficient strength for this reconnaissance in force?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, my lord. The techs have made commendable progress restoring our fighter strength.

I don&#039;t think I could do it for her, let alone Twilight.

Everything I accused Princess Celestia of doing to me? I wish I could go back to my younger self and smack her seeing what happened to my mother. Yes, that&#039;s right. Mother.

But I have to admit, for someone who even refers to herself as the &quot;Mother of the Apocalypse,&quot; she can be very caring. </p><p class="double">She even recognized me as an Equestrian looper, and used her powers to turn us both into ponies so that we could enjoy our time together.

<p>89.1</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Sweetie said, over cocoa. “You guys up for this?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Gilda nodded. “Suits me fine.”</p><p class="double">“Your plan is one to which I accede.” Zecora sipped some more of the hot drink. “At what time do you wish we proceed?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie adjusted her scarf. “Well, tomorrow afternoon&#039;s the Wrap-Up... let&#039;s go with eleven in the morning.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Attention, Ponyville!” Sweetie announced, standing on top of a box. “The amazing Zecora and I will perform step one of the Winter Wrap-Up – blooming this tree!”</p><p class="double">She pointed to the library.</p><p class="double">“Miss Sparkle,” she added in a voice she deliberately made deeper. “What kind of tree is that?”</p><p class="double">“My home?” Twilight checked. “It&#039;s an oak.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Sweetie winked. “Right, let&#039;s go. Zecora?”</p><p class="double">The zebra nodded wordlessly, flipped her wooden staff, and began dancing.</p><p class="double">Sweetie pulled a flute from behind her ear and began playing. Drums, trumpets, stringed instruments and the sound of multiple voices chanting issued forth from the silver instrument, building to a crescendo as Zecora pointed extravagantly at a bare branch.</p><p class="double">There was a flicker of light and shadow describing a circle around the branch, then it pulsed and flowered into a blaze of cherry blossom.</p><p class="double">At the back of the astonished crowd, Gilda moved carefully from one place to another, and kept her inky tailtip raised. Her beak moved slightly with a repressed grin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>By now, almost the entire tree was coated in sweet-scented pink flowers. Zecora&#039;s dance had gotten more and more energetic, there&#039;d definitely been some breakdancing in there, and for the last minute there&#039;d been an orange sitting serenely on her head for no apparent reason.</p><p class="double">Then, as the music grew to a final crescendo, she stopped moving. Sitting on her backside, facing the tree, she made six sharp gestures.</p><p class="double">A final circle of cherry blossom spun around the tree-</p><p class="double">And petals exploded outwards.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Eh heh heh...” Sweetie said, scratching the back of her neck with a hoof. “Guess we overdid it, huh.”</p><p class="double">“Looks like,” Gilda replied with a shrug, looking around at the entirely not-snowy-at-all ground around Ponyville. “Thought only those special enchanted trees did that. Hey, I see blossom over at the Apple farm.”</p><p class="double">“You do?” Sweetie craned her neck. “...oh, great. That&#039;s cherry blossom. Zecora, think you could go fix it so they don&#039;t have to become the Cherry farm?”</p><p class="double">“I will, ensure, their crop, is steady,” Zecora panted, “As soon, as my breath, is not, so heavy...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.2</p><p class="double">So You&#039;re Time Looping</p><p class="double"><i>A short guide, by Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double"></i>Hello!</p><p class="double">Welcome to the wider universe. If you&#039;ve just been given this short booklet, then either you&#039;re in a world you don&#039;t recognize, or someone you don&#039;t know is taking the place of someone you do. Don&#039;t worry, this is entirely normal, and you should be back to the world you&#039;re familiar with next time around.</p><p class="double">This booklet is intended to make you, the reader and newly contacted looper, familiar with the terms that more experienced loopers use. It will also let you know what you can expect in the future, and a little about why.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Loop (noun)</p><p class="double">This is each individual time that you go back in time. So each time you wake up back in time, you&#039;re in a new Loop. The term is also used to refer to separate worlds – so I, for example, am from the Equestria Loop. Loops have a usual start point and a usual end point, but neither is guaranteed. End points are more likely to be the same loop-to-loop than start points.</p><p class="double">Looping (verb)</p><p class="double">The process of going back in time, and the process of turning up in a new loop. So I occasionally Loop into the world known as Berk, and I am said to be “Looping into” Berk. I have Looped in the past; I am a Looper; you are also a Looper.</p><p class="double">Yggdrasil (proper noun)</p><p class="double">Yggdrasil is the tree that is the multiverse. All loops are, to extend an analogy, &#039;branches&#039; of Yggdrasil. It has recently suffered severe damage, though the situation is contained. That&#039;s why the loops happen.</p><p class="double">Awake (noun; verb)</p><p class="double">To be Awake is to have memories of having gone back in time; that is, to have Looped this time. Sometimes people Awaken before or after the time that everyone else does – my friend Princess Celestia, for example, sometimes Awakens nearly a thousand years in the past from when I Awaken. You have to be a looper to be Awake, but not all Loopers are Awake every time.</p><p class="double">Anchor (noun)</p><p class="double">Almost every known Loop has at least one Anchor. The Anchor is (one of) the first to start looping in a given Loop. I am an Anchor, for example. The Anchor for a given loop is easy to work out – they&#039;re the one who&#039;s always Awake. (Well, almost always.) They&#039;re the one who&#039;s able to be the only one Awake. So, sometimes I&#039;m Awake and none of my friends are.</p><p class="double">The death of the last present Anchor within a certain period tends to instantly end the loop.</p><p class="double">Replace (verb)</p><p class="double">To take the place normally occupied by another individual, looping or not. This includes if you have swapped places with a friend, for example, though it is normally used when the place you are occupying is in another loop.</p><p class="double">Fused loop (noun)</p><p class="double">The term “Fused” loop is somewhat fluid. The more general meaning is that it is any iteration of a loop where elements from more than one world – looping or not – are present. So, for example, a world where my world and yours were mixed together might mean that I&#039;m there. It might mean that everyone was ponies. Or it might just mean that there&#039;s a few of my fellow Equestrian loopers there, as humans.</p><p class="double">The more specific meaning is the middle one – where there are things <i>other than loopers</i> from both worlds. Or from all three, or more.</p><p class="double">Baseline (noun)</p><p class="double">The events of the first run-through of a loop, and the events that tend to result with no outside interference. If, for example, your home loop had none of its loopers awake, and I was a million light years away and never got any closer, then the events back at your home region would be baseline.</p><p class="double">Admin (noun)</p><p class="double">The admins are the deities who run Yggdrasil and who are working to fix it. If you meet them directly, there are a few things to remember. First, they spend a substantial fraction of their existences working to keep you alive, so allow for that. Second, they are essentially gods of a power beyond anything you have. Yes, that includes you. And third, they do care for the worlds they run – try to stay on their good side. It&#039;s just common courtesy.</p><p class="double">Sakura Syndrome (noun)</p><p class="double">Named after the unfortunate Sakura Haruno, who was the first documented case. Loopers with a case of Sakura Syndrome tend to focus on the fact that things are returned to their original state when a loop restarts, and begin to use this to their advantage. The stricter definition is that they begin behaving like this to fellow loopers – who are <i>not</i> reset in this manner – while the less strict definition is simply that they exploit the loops to mistreat non-looping individuals.</p><p class="double">People with this problem tend to come about because they have become bored or apathetic as a result of the loops, and turn to one means or another to enjoy themselves. This becomes gradually more extreme over time. The process is not inevitable, but care should be taken.</p><p class="double">Sufferers of Sakura Syndrome are unfortunate. They are also potentially dangerous, and as a new looper I cannot guarantee your safety near them.</p><p class="double">Setsuna Syndrome (noun).</p><p class="double">The opposite of Sakura Syndrome, named for Setsuna Meiou. This is the case when a Looper comes to believe that the events of the baseline are sacrosanct and must not be interfered with.</p><p class="double">This is especially dangerous – and risky, both for the sufferer and for others – when they are not the only one Awake. Sufferers of Setsuna Syndrome may get violent to preserve what they see as the true timeline, and they can easily bite off more than they can chew.</p><p class="double">Setsuna Syndrome, unlike Sakura Syndrome, has a known and reliable solution in that it results from a simple misconception. Admins can help to talk sufferers around if other measures have not sufficed.</p><p class="double">Subspace Pocket (noun)</p><p class="double">An ability most loopers eventually develop. This consists of setting up a storage space inside one&#039;s soul, into which objects may be placed. The size of the pocket grows with time and with your own personal discipline and power. These objects are carried between loops, which is of course very useful.</p><p class="double">Punishment Loop (noun)</p><p class="double">You may have had one of these already. Don&#039;t worry, we all do. They&#039;re bland, often embarrassing, and unpleasant to be in, you tend not to have access to most of your normal abilities, and you probably ended up there after doing something stupid which backfired spectacularly.</p><p class="double">These are usually quite stable places, where you&#039;re put while the admins fix whatever you damaged. Just grin and bear it – trying to end a punishment loop early doesn&#039;t end well.</p><p class="double">Eiken (proper noun)</p><p class="double">The most common punishment loop.</p><p class="double">Generation (noun, adjective)</p><p class="double">Generations of loopers are essentially groups who started looping at about the same time. For example, I first started looping several thousand loops after the world of Berk, so I am technically from a younger generation than the Berk Anchor, Hiccup. But given how many loops there have been, we tend to be spoken of as being part of the same generation.</p><p class="double">First Generation (noun)</p><p class="double">The loopers who started looping first. All Anchors, all very powerful. Owing to calculation issues (they&#039;ve all lost count), it is unclear whether there are five or seven. The broader definition is: Ranma Saotome, Shinji Ikari, Harry Potter, Naruto Uzumaki, Lina Inverse, Usagi Tsukino and Ichigo Kurosaki. (Evidence exists that Ichigo is younger, but evidence that he is the same generation also exists. Usagi, meanwhile, appears to have pretended that her friend Rei was the Anchor for a considerable time.)</p><p class="double">Ping (noun, verb)</p><p class="double">A combination of several different types of abilities that only somebody who had been to multiple universes could perform. You send a ping when you want to know if anybody else is Awake, and they (usually) ping back. However, you usually can&#039;t identify the source of a ping. Some Loops, such as my own, might have other ways of identifying Awake individuals. Like with the Subspace Pocket, you might want to ask the person who gave you this pamphlet about how to do this. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>I hope that this booklet was helpful. If you ever find yourself in Equestria, then drop by for a chat. My name is Twilight Sparkle, I tend to be a unicorn and live in a library-tree, and the secret code phrase is &#039;Hi, I&#039;m a visiting Looper&#039;. I&#039;d like to hear if there&#039;s anything that should be added to this booklet.</p><p class="double">Good luck!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“...well, that was surprisingly cheerful,” Mercedes Thompson said, looking up from the pamphlet. “Do you just... carry these?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I do.” Leah rummaged in her jacket for a moment, and pulled out a photo album. “Here&#039;s the author, by the way. Twilight Sparkle – I owe her a lot.”</p><p class="double">Mercy blinked. “<i>That&#039;s</i> where I recognize the... she&#039;s a My Little Pony, isn&#039;t she?”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded. “Yep. Hey, don&#039;t get too smug – I&#039;ve got copies of your books. So, when are you getting married to Adam this time?”</p><p class="double">The skin-walker went bright red. “What the – but-”</p><p class="double">Her consternation was answered by a grin. Then Leah clapped her on the shoulder. “Right, to business. Do you want help from me, and if so how much?”</p><p class="double">“...give me a minute to think about it, please,” Mercy requested. “But yeah, if you&#039;re willing that&#039;d be huge.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.3:</p><p class="double">“Rarity?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Can you fix this dress for me? I&#039;m afraid a chandelier fell on it.”</p><p class="double">“Certainly, Twilight. It&#039;d be a pleasure.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.4:</p><p class="double">“Well...” Luna began, awkwardly. “This is... new.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not wrong there,” replied Trixie. “Wonder where Twilight is?”</p><p class="double">“She will turn up,” Luna dismissed. “Eventually. What is the greater concern, however, is how we are going to do this.”</p><p class="double">“And does this mean your name is Luna Moon?” Nyx piped up.</p><p class="double">The other two looked at her.</p><p class="double">“Well, I mean, I&#039;m Nightmare Moon, and Trix is Trixie Lula Moon, so, since you&#039;re kinda our mom this time...”</p><p class="double">“Neigh, to have the name of Luna Moon is silly,” Luna pronounced. “As that would make me Moon Moon.”</p><p class="double">Trixie sniggered.</p><p class="double">“...so, how <i>do</i> we do this?” she asked, after a moment. “And can we send envoys to the Changeling lands by yesterday?”</p><p class="double">With a <i>pomf</i>, a letter landed between them.</p><p class="double">“Ah, excellent,” Luna pronounced, taking it up and opening it. “Hm. Well, it would appear that we know where Twilight Sparkle is...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“I&#039;ve had some strange families in the loops before, I&#039;ll freely admit,” Twilight freely admitted. “But this one takes the cake.”</p><p class="double">“What is it, then?” Gilda asked, adjusting her big floppy chief-of-staff hat.</p><p class="double">“Well... I&#039;m the gryphon empress,” Twilight pointed out.</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged. “You&#039;re not telling me you&#039;ve not done <i>that</i> before.”</p><p class="double">“Not as an owl, no,” Twilight said. “And the fact that my ruling clan includes you, a tortoise I can only assume is Rainbow Dash, and a certain psychopathic bunny-”</p><p class="double">“<i>Socio</i>pathic,” Gilda said firmly. “I think.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Correction tentatively accepted. Anyway. I sent a letter to Equestria. But I can pick up <i>all three</i> elements of Kindness... any ideas where <i>they</i> are?”</p><p class="double">“Ask Dash,” Gilda suggested. “She&#039;ll know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are we team shapeshifter?” Silver asked, as all three Elements of Kindness padded, trotted or floated down the hallway.</p><p class="double">“Presumably,” Chrysalis replied. “I appreciate you two blocking yourselves out of the hive for now, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll keep it up... unless you want me not to, that is,” the wolf next to her replied. “I know we looped in as changeling sisters and we&#039;re supposed to fight over the position of queen, but... that seems altogether too unkind...”</p><p class="double">“Okay, that&#039;s great.” Chrysalis nodded to her. “Let&#039;s see... hey, what kind of bedrooms do you two want? I learned interior design once, so now the whole swarm knows.”</p><p class="double">“Matte black,” Silver replied promptly. “I officially declare myself the teenage rebel technically-a-changeling princess.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.5</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Sunset started, wincing. “I didn&#039;t think about how this conversation would actually go...”</p><p class="double">Spike raised an eyebrow. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” The unicorn shook her head. “I... look, you two are kind of famous in the multiverse. Almost everyone I visited, once they found out where I was from, had a few words to say about you.”</p><p class="double">“Oh. Right. That.” Spike blushed.</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled. “Well, I suppose it must have been my wonderful personality.”</p><p class="double">“And what am I, a handbag?” Spike groused, barely restraining a happy grin.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Rarity considered. “Yes. But in an attractive colour that goes with my hair.”</p><p class="double">“I should have known you only wanted me as an accessory...”</p><p class="double">Sunset blinked, head moving back and forth as the two bantered easily.</p><p class="double">“Accessorize well, and the world is your mollusc,” Rarity said sagely. “Largely because the great big strong dragon accessory will pry it open for you and turn the pearls into jewellery.”</p><p class="double">“Unless he&#039;s feeling peckish,” Spike rejoined. “In which case, you&#039;ll have to live with the terrible privation of getting a necklace made out of nacre. And slightly more dragon.”</p><p class="double">“Well, more dragon is a net plus,” Rarity allowed. “I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to say you&#039;re a hot water bottle, but...”</p><p class="double">“Okay, how the hell do you <i>do</i> that?” Sunset asked, unable to restrain herself any longer. “I mean... you&#039;ve been married for, what, longer than some loops have been a thing! And...”</p><p class="double">She slumped. “And you seem so comfortable together. I have to work <i>so</i> hard at that, and I never really get it down. I&#039;m starting to wonder if I <i>can.</i>”</p><p class="double">Sunset sighed deeply.</p><p class="double">Spike shot a glance at Rarity, who returned it worriedly.</p><p class="double">“Sunset...” Spike began, carefully. “It might amaze you to know this, but it took us over a hundred years to get to the point we were officially dating.”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded, seeing where Spike was going with this. “It wasn&#039;t always easy – we had our own traumas to work through, at the time, and even now there&#039;s the occasional thing which troubles me-”</p><p class="double">“Us,” Spike interjected. “If it&#039;s your problem, it&#039;s mine.”</p><p class="double">“And right there,” Sunset said, shaking her head again. “I understand it&#039;s how this loop works – how <i>home</i> works,” she added in a tone of slight wonderment. “But after so long places where the loopers will do things like rig traps the size of small towns and trick one another into compromising situations as a matter of course... it&#039;s going to take a while to get used to that kind of teamwork. Trust, I suppose.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a lot of it, yes,” Rarity confirmed. “But the rest... we&#039;re comfortable with one another, we&#039;re comfortable with <i>ourselves</i> for the most part, and as such we just... relax.</p><p class="double">Spike closed his eyes, and raised a hand. “May I?”</p><p class="double">Sunset looked lost.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m a Jedi, remember,” he pointed out. “Mind if I give you a quick once-over?”</p><p class="double">“...sure,” she said warily.</p><p class="double">For the next thirty or so seconds, no-one spoke. Spike&#039;s breathing became deep, steady and even, and while Sunset wasn&#039;t able to relax nearly as much as he had, she found the quiet reassuring nevertheless.</p><p class="double">Then Spike snored.</p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>Spike,</i>” Rarity said with a long-suffering smile. She tapped him on the shoulder, and he jolted. “Did you fall asleep meditating again?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Probably</i> not,” Spike replied in a hurt tone. “Anyway. Sunset, you do have a bit of darkness in there – but that&#039;s really not surprising, most loopers tend to be grey. By the feel of it, you&#039;ve got it well under control.”</p><p class="double">“So... what&#039;s next?” Sunset asked.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Rarity took over. “The point I was getting at before is, Spike and I are as comfortable together as we are because of long association. You&#039;ve been shuffled from world to world repeatedly up until very recently, so you&#039;ve never really had a chance to put down some roots.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded along. “I recommend a course of treatment. First off, have a few sessions with Fluttershy, because she&#039;s so non-threatening that she should circumvent any combat fatigue you might have. After that, spend a few loops working on the Apple farm – Twilight can see about getting you hired. That&#039;s steady, monotonous work, but more importantly the Apples are as steady as the earth. They&#039;ll help reassure you you&#039;re here to stay.”</p><p class="double">“And what then?”</p><p class="double">“Then, next time Celestia&#039;s looping, just... talk to her. As much as you can – about an hour every day – about whatever comes to mind. Where you&#039;ve been. What you&#039;ve learned. Show off a bit, perhaps.” Spike&#039;s smile was gentle. “I think she&#039;s missed you, as well. She doesn&#039;t talk about it much, but I happen to have noticed on several occasions that whenever she has a Sisters loop she connives to have you get a good position in court. Nothing stressful, just... something with a lot of free time.”</p><p class="double">Sunset considered that, then nodded slowly. “That does sound nice.”</p><p class="double">“Which is half the point,” Spike confirmed. “It&#039;s slower than the more exciting ways of building friendships, but if anything more secure.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Sunset shot a glance at Spike, and grinned. “Live long, and prosper, and all that.”</p><p class="double">Spike returned her grin. “And may the force be with you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.6</p><p class="double">“I call it an &#039;honours list&#039;,” Celestia said brightly. “Do you like it?”</p><p class="double">“It seems as though thou art granting knighthoods to all manner of unsuitable candidates,” Luna answered, looking down the list. “For certes, I can see the appeal of those like Twilight Sparkle and fair Applejack, but... whence is Fluttershy a warrior?”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve never annoyed her, I take it,” Celestia replied. “She&#039;s scary.”</p><p class="double">“This one for the Mayor of Ponyville?”</p><p class="double">“Above and beyond the call of duty,” Celestia explained. “She tried to tackle you when you turned up as Nightmare Moon.”</p><p class="double">Luna frowned, but let it go. “Who is this &#039;Trixie&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“A travelling performer.” Celestia shrugged. “I like her shows.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Luna kept reading down the scroll. “Rainbow Dash makes sense... A mare called Berry Punch?”</p><p class="double">“She makes the most <i>lovely</i> banana cordial.”</p><p class="double">“Scootaloo?”</p><p class="double">“A filly who Dash adopted. She&#039;s good on a scooter.”</p><p class="double">Luna raised an eyebrow. “Ditzy Doo?”</p><p class="double">“She delivered a nice letter to me. Granted, it was six months late, but...”</p><p class="double">The other one joined it. “Angel Bunny?”</p><p class="double">“It was under duress.”</p><p class="double">“Queen Chrysalis?”</p><p class="double">“Diplomatic purposes.”</p><p class="double">“Vinyl Scratch?”</p><p class="double">“I like her music. Must you interrogate me on every choice?”</p><p class="double">“Not <i>every</i> choice, dear sister.” Luna scanned down the scroll, occasionally muttering under her breath. “Pony Joe?”</p><p class="double">“He gave me a free donut last time I went.”</p><p class="double">“Celly, this doth seem much like a frivolous use of the royal prerogative...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no,” Celestia denied. “That&#039;s when I ennobled a squirrel as the duchess of the Everfree.”</p><p class="double">“...you <i>what?</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silverleaf put the royal proclamation down. “...okay, wasn&#039;t expecting that.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara, who was for whatever reason her &#039;owner&#039; this loop (pet squirrels had been &#039;in&#039; at some point pre-loop), took the paper. “Huh. Okay, I&#039;m going to request that Applebloom builds the biggest treehouse in local history as your ducal residence.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.7</p><p class="double">They Awoke running.</p><p class="double">Being less experienced than most loopers with running, at least while bipedal, they staggered, tripped, one hit the other and they ended up in a heap.</p><p class="double">“Ow,” Luna complained.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s not my fault I landed on you,” Celestia replied grumpily. “Where are we?”</p><p class="double">As she spoke, she pushed herself off Luna and stood up. Luna followed, favouring her right leg slightly.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m never used to this,” Luna grumbled. “Right. Start-up check. Pocket?”</p><p class="double">“Check,” Celestia replied, producing a slim wooden stick out of thin air. “Magic?”</p><p class="double">“Check,” Luna replied, as her own wand jetted red sparks. She then turned into an alicorn.</p><p class="double">“Oh, show-off,” Celestia groused. “Just because you put in the effort to get your animagus form...”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a sensible precaution,” her sister pointed out. “Now, why were we running?”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded at some figures approaching them at a ground-eating sprint, with twisted faces and sharp fangs. As they approached, the monstrous humanoids seemed startled by something, and slowed in confusion.</p><p class="double">“Wait, are those vampires?” Luna checked, squinting. “They&#039;ve got the fangs.”</p><p class="double">“And I think it&#039;s safe to assume that they&#039;re not <i>good</i> ones, seeing as how they&#039;re after us,” Celestia agreed. “Right. You take the ones on the left?”</p><p class="double">“Not <i>just</i> the ones on the left, thanks,” Luna answered. “Sorry in advance, sis.”</p><p class="double">The moon went down, and the sun came up.</p><p class="double">With some very abrupt screams, the vampires dematerialized into clouds of dust.</p><p class="double">“...well, that worked,” Celestia allowed. “But that&#039;s also probably going to be on the news. Now, where&#039;s the local anchor...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Alexander &#039;Xander&#039; Lavalle Harris blinked in what was apparently the 2am sunrise.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Guess that means I&#039;ve got visitors. Couldn&#039;t they just do the easy type thing and turn up at the library tomorrow morning?”</p><p class="double">He rolled over in bed and pulled a pillow over his head. Sunnydale Awakenings could be at all hours of the day and night, and he needed some less-ugly sleep.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>89.8</p><p class="double">“Two households, both alike in dignity,</p><p>In fair Equestria, where we lay our scene,</p><p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p><p>Where civil blood makes civil hoofs unclean.</p><p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p><p>A pair of star-cross&#039;d lovers take their life,</p><p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p><p>Do with their death bury their parents&#039; strife.</p><p>The fearful passage of their death-mark&#039;d love,</p><p>And the continuance of their parents&#039; rage,</p><p>Which, but their children&#039;s end, nought could remove,</p><p>Is now the two hours&#039; traffic of our stage;</p><p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p><p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.”</p><p class="double">Zecora shrugged, and held up a sign. &#039;It&#039;s a job.&#039; Then paused, thought for a moment, and threw the script over her shoulder.</p><p class="double">&quot;They won&#039;t actually do it, though. They&#039;re much smarter than Romeo and Juliet. In fact, my thought is that it&#039;ll be done by four.&quot;</p><p class="double">That said, she began rummaging in her pocket for something to cook popcorn with.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Spike felt words leap to his lips as he entered the party. Words in Iambic Pentameter.</p><p class="double"><i>Screw that. I know how this goes...</p><p class="double"></i>A moment&#039;s check showed a few salient details. The ruler of the city of Equestria – yes, city this time, not country – was Prince Solaris. His kinsmen were Count Macintosh and one of Spike&#039;s friends, Armorio.</p><p class="double">Other familiar faces also turned up, as usual. Twilight, for example, appeared to be his cousin. But most of the important roles in the play were left clear – as they should be if it was Spear Shaker&#039;s play.</p><p class="double">From long experience, Spike knew there were two ways to handle a loop with a strong sense of narrative. Either make a clean break from the conventions straight away, so they had nothing to cling onto, or ride the story until it offered an out.</p><p class="double"><i>Let&#039;s try option one.</p><p class="double"></i>“Lord Capulet,” he began, sweeping an elegant bow. Time as a pony over many loops meant that it was as graceful as anyone could want. “Might I have the honour of asking for your daughter&#039;s hand in marriage?”</p><p class="double">He shrugged a wing, flipping his facemask off and revealing himself to be of house Montague, as the various unicorns and pegasi stared. “If it helps, I&#039;m fairly sure it would end a feud, and-”</p><p class="double">Rarity glomped him.</p><p class="double">“How do you always know just the right thing to do?” he asked in a whisper, as bedlam erupted.</p><p class="double">“I know you,” she replied. “Quite well.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“Well, that was a bust,” Spike sighed, some hours later. “Looks like option one didn&#039;t work. Any ideas?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, flaring her own wings. “Assuming you don&#039;t want me to just go alicorn? I suggest an incredibly convoluted scheme which doesn&#039;t involve anything in the way of poison, though sleeping potion and poison joke might work well. I&#039;ll let Rarity know, she&#039;ll start on her own similarly elaborate and similarly complicated scheme, and I&#039;ll carry messages between the two of you.”</p><p class="double">She gave him a look. “And be careful with duels!”</p><p class="double">“Always,” he replied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“This was <i>not</i> a cunning scheme,” Twilight pointed out, barely half an hour later.</p><p class="double">“It worked, didn&#039;t it?” Spike defended. “I thought getting the local CMC involved was inspired.”</p><p class="double">“You <i>did</i> get my sister running the streets with urchins, darling. The shame!” Rarity flounced, then grinned. “Like she wasn&#039;t doing that already, admittedly... I have to admit, though, a moving siege tower that sings Volare was the most improbable thing they&#039;ve come up with in a while.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, they&#039;re inventive when they&#039;ve got a challenge.” Spike peered over the side. “Okay, this looks like far enough. Girls! You can stop now?”</p><p class="double">“What is this <i>stop</i> you speak of?” Scootaloo&#039;s voice drifted up from inside the contraption. “Is it like go but less?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;ll do!” Spike replied.</p><p class="double">“Oh. We may have a problem there, then.”</p><p class="double">“Look, brakes are <i>hard</i>,” Applebloom whined. “Especially with these materials, they&#039;re appalling. Abominable.”</p><p class="double">“Atrocious?” Sweetie suggested.</p><p class="double">“Thanks. Yeah, that. Also, I think there&#039;s woodworm.”</p><p class="double">Spike, Twilight and Rarity exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Abandon siege tower!” Twilight announced.</p><p class="double">Spike picked Rarity up. “Hope you don&#039;t mind.”</p><p class="double">“Not at all, dear,” she assured him, and then the dramatic scene where they escaped the runaway siege tower was abruptly stymied as it hit a clothes-line.</p><p class="double">Assorted crashing noises filled the area.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Prince Solaris blinked as a unicorn, a pegasus, three fillies and enough wood to manufacture a war galley avalanched through the front door of his throne room.</p><p class="double">Twilight flew in through the opened front door, alighting on the floor next to her dazed fellow loopers. “Afternoon, my prince. These two want to get married, and it&#039;d prevent the Montague-Capulet feud. Should I call a priest?”</p><p class="double">She looked behind herself. “I&#039;d hurry, though, I think the House Capulet guards noticed us.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“And why should I accept this betrothal?” Lord Capulet demanded. “My eldest daughter, with a Montague!”</p><p class="double">“And my son seduced by a Capulet!” Lord Montague added.</p><p class="double">“Because otherwise they&#039;d have been in love anyway, they&#039;d have started climbing walls to see one another at night – or, for that matter, Spike would have just flown in – and then there&#039;d have been a duel, and Spike would have been exiled, and Rarity would fake her death with potion to get out of the planned wedding because they&#039;d already have had a clandestine wedding, and they&#039;d plan to run away after the funeral, but Spike wouldn&#039;t get the message, and he&#039;d think she was really dead and take poison, and then she&#039;d take poison and stab herself, and you&#039;d reconcile but with your eldest children dead.”</p><p class="double">Everypony stared at Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Seen it happen,” she shrugged. “Look, they&#039;re thirteen years old, do <i>you</i> think they&#039;d behave rationally?”</p><p class="double">Solaris spread his wings. “The betrothal is binding. Montague, and Capulet, your petty feud is through.”</p><p class="double">After much grumbling, the two lords shook hoofs.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora smiled at the back of the hall, noting that the clock read three fifty-seven. “Then sigh not so, But let them go, And be you blithe and bonny; Converting all your sounds of woe into Hey nonny, nonny.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s from a different play,” Twilight pointed out.</p><p class="double">“The one I quote is comedy, which this is more than tragedy,” Zecora replied promptly.</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.9</p><p class="double">Twilight yawned. “Aah, it&#039;s sometimes nice to Wake up Asleep.”</p><p class="double">She stretched, which brought to her attention the fact that she was human. Then a body moved next to her in the bed, which brought her attention to the fact that she wasn&#039;t alone in the bed.</p><p class="double">She got up quickly, making distance from the other person in the bed, already thinking about how this was going to go – and saw a head of long, blonde hair with familiar-looking red highlights.</p><p class="double">“Sunset?”</p><p class="double">The other humanized pony yawned. “Morning, sis.” She blinked, then her eyes widened as the loop memories hit both of them. “Huh. You <i>are</i> my sister.”</p><p class="double">“Twin, I seem to recall?” Twilight checked, getting a nod. “Right. And I think I know where we are.”</p><p class="double">“In what sense?” Sunset asked, swinging her legs over the side of the bed and standing up. With a flash, her keyblade appeared, then vanished. She frowned in concentration, and her clothes blinked twice. “There we go...”</p><p class="double">“What was that?” Twilight watched, interested, as Sunset&#039;s clothes flowed from pyjamas to jeans and a T-shirt.</p><p class="double">“Magic clothes, like Sora has. Kinda convenient when you&#039;re human.” Sunset grinned. “I should remember to show Rarity, she&#039;d reverse engineer it in about a day. Oh, where did you say we were?”</p><p class="double">“Right. Well, in terms of geography, we&#039;re in Washington state in America.” Twilight grimaced. “And in terms of loop, we&#039;re in-”</p><p class="double">The door opened with a bang.</p><p class="double">Leah Clearwater stood in the doorway, with her hair in disarray and her eyes wet with unshed tears. Her gaze skittered across Sunset, widened in recognition, and then onto Twilight, and her face seemed to crumple with relief. “Thank Fenris, it <i>is</i> you.”</p><p class="double">“Leah,” Twilight replied, blinking. “What happened?”</p><p class="double">“Later,” the shifter replied. “For now... just give me a few minutes, okay?”</p><p class="double">And Leah, tough-as-nails werewolf, sat down on the floor and started crying.</p><p class="double">“Is she okay?” Sunset asked in a low tone. “I mean, she seemed fine last time I met her. Valdemar-”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Leah hiccuped, and scowled. “Yeah, I remember,” she went on. “But my last loop... kind of brought everything back like it was in the bad old days. Feeling helpless-”</p><p class="double">Twilight hugged her. “Don&#039;t worry, you&#039;re among friends.”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“Okay,” she said, some minutes later. “I awoke really late on last loop. In one of the minor variations of my baseline. You know how the books are a pretty faithful account of what happens in my baseline?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Twilight replied, grimacing. She was glad she didn&#039;t have a world anything like as bad as the one the &#039;were faced every time around.</p><p class="double">“Right. Well, this one was more like a bit of the films. Have you seen them?”</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced over at Sunset, who shook her head, and turned back to Leah. “Neither of us have.”</p><p class="double">Leah took a deep breath. “Okay. Well, I&#039;ve got a copy in my pocket, so lock the door and turn on your DVD player. I&#039;ll show you what happened.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>The local Anchor hit stop on the DVD remote, and turned to her guests.</p><p class="double">Both of them still had their jaws dropped.</p><p class="double">“...what did we just see happen?” Twilight managed.</p><p class="double">“Well.” Leah threw the remote across the room, and it bounced off the wall with a clunk. The batteries fell separately to the rest of it. “What you just saw was a battle breaking out between the Cullens – and my poor, Alpha-ordered pack – and the Volturi. All of them. And then you saw a vampire with element control abilities open a chasm so deep the mantle was visible. And then you saw me <i>f*cking well fall into it.</i>”</p><p class="double">Leah hyperventilated for a few seconds, then visibly got a grip on her reactions.</p><p class="double">“I have <i>never</i> hated my own healing ability as much,” she finished bitterly.</p><p class="double">Sunset said a word which caused Twilight to wince.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight added, after a moment&#039;s thought. “As far as I&#039;m concerned, this is a loop for your benefit, Leah. What do you want us to do? Can we help?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, you can indeed help,” Leah answered. “First off, make sure Eddy boy and his family <i>sod off.</i> Where doesn&#039;t matter.”</p><p class="double">“Dibs on that,” Sunset called. “They&#039;re undead golems, right?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “One or two of them aren&#039;t evil, per se,” she pointed out, and Leah reluctantly nodded.</p><p class="double">“No problem.” Sunset made a gesture, and Glimmering Sunset materialized. “They don&#039;t harm the innocent. Now, which way to Cullenville?”</p><p class="double">“...maybe later,” Leah said, after several long seconds. “I kind of want to watch. But second, teach me how to survive falling into mantle-temperature magma.”</p><p class="double">“There, you may be in luck,” Twilight said with a grin. “It&#039;s a spell called Elemental Body, from Oerth...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“I kind of thought the Cullens liked baseball,” Twilight commented absently.</p><p class="double">“Eh, it&#039;s popular, they probably don&#039;t like it any more,” Leah replied, taking a long cool drink from her slushie. “Hey, Sunny! Go for a home run!”</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer gestured with her keyblade, and Edward Cullen levitated into the air in an aura of red-streaked golden magic. Then shot towards her at at least a hundred miles an hour.</p><p class="double"><i>CRACK!</p><p class="double"></i>“Looks like a home run to me,” Twilight said, as the vampire cleared a nearby treetop. “But you&#039;re not getting the distance you could, Sunset.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m just getting warmed up!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.10</p><p class="double">“Light ahoy off the larboard bow, cap&#039;n!”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. “First mate? Go aloft and check the lookout&#039;s spot. We may be able to ride out this storm yet.”</p><p class="double">“Aye, cap&#039;n.” Luna lashed herself to one of the lines, and made for the weather shrouds.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“Okay, explain,” Twilight requested, as Dash spun together another squall and kicked it at the wildly tossing schooner.</p><p class="double">“Oh, they asked,” Dash replied, looking around for some quality rainclouds. “I understand it all developed from a bad pun.”</p><p class="double">“What bad pun?”</p><p class="double">Dash pointed, as Luna nearly went flying overboard. “Sailor Moon.”</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned. “Okay, OW.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">89.11</p><p class="double">Twilight pored over the book in front of her. After a dozen of these peculiar &#039;time loops&#039;, as she&#039;d taken to calling them, she was running out of readily accessible reading material.</p><p class="double">So she&#039;d broken into the places where dangerous books were kept.</p><p class="double">This one was a bit tame, really. It just went into how to teleport into space, without bothering to explain how to cast spells to protect one from the vacuum to be found up there. But, well, it was something – something useful for longer range teleports, specifically.</p><p class="double">She finished it, and turned to the next book on the pile.</p><p class="double">“Inspiration manifestation...” she mused. “Well, it&#039;s certainly a poetic title...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said firmly. “Never going near that one again. Never touching it, never opening that place, never mentioning it. Nope.”</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t want to go the way of Discord.</p><p class="double">Mind you, she really should have taken his grinning portrait on the &#039;about the author&#039; page as a hint...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>89.12 (namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer blinked.</p><p class="double">Her usual awakening points were either in the fused loops or right after entering the weird human world on the other side of the mirror gate. So the first thing that went through her mind, understandably, was <i>I&#039;M A PONY! SQUEE!</i> She&#039;d never looped back far enough that she was still in Equestria. Judging from the current location, she was in the same spot Twilight had come up to her after she&#039;d brushed off a group of ponies saying she was too busy to socialize. A quick check over her right shoulder confirmed the fact, combined with the fact that Twilight Sparkle, Shining Armor, and Princess Cadance were right there, and, in fact, were looking back somewhat...<i>anticipatory</i>?</p><p class="double">Her thoughts were derailed as the expected group showed up. The sudden realization that <i>Lyra</i> was there was another shock, idly leading her to wonder if her studies about the other side of the mirror gate had led the unicorn to become obsessed with humans.</p><p class="double">&quot;-like to come have lunch with us?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>How many times have I said no? How would things have changed if I had not been such a immature, power-hungry brat then? </i>Sunset inhaled slightly before responding. &quot;I&#039;d like to, but right now, I&#039;m feeling kind of Loopy.&quot; Lyra&#039;s eyes twitched at the expression, confirming her suspicions of her being awake. Sunset simply smiled slightly. &quot;Perhaps later?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, yeah, sure. Thanks?&quot; Lemon Hearts sounded stunned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds great! I&#039;ll catch you latter.&quot; Sunset set her books into her saddlebag and trotted over to the other trio of loopers.</p><p class="double">Shining looked smug as she approached. &quot;Twilight won the bet, Cady! Long odds, by poplar.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset wasn&#039;t sure she should have been outraged. &quot;You bet whether I was awake this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Pink Princess Pony just giggled. &quot;Oh no! Nothing like that. We just betting whether if you were awake this early, or whether you would awake after me or Twilight befriending you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset opened her mouth, let it hang open for a moment, and then closed it with a small chuckle. &quot;Well, I guess there&#039;re worse ways to have a bet settled.&quot; Her eyes turned to the filly Twilight Princess as she got a warm smile and hug in return.</p><p class="double">&quot;So Twily, what do you want to do this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a magical world, Sunset, my friend,&quot; stated Twilight as she pulled back from nuzzling her. &quot;Let&#039;s go exploring!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">From Sunset Shimmer&#039;s Journal:</p><p class="double">I&#039;ve decided to stop giving entries numbers, since I have no idea how long my journey to my home Loop will be.</p><p class="double">After my last entry, I was more or less willing to take a vacation Loop or two. </p><p class="double">But when I saw an old man about to be killed by a robber, I had to help him. After I drove away the robber with a bit of Ranma&#039;s teachings, I asked the man&#039;s name.</p><p class="double">It was Ben Parker.</p><p class="double">Whoops. Luckily, Spider-Man was Awake, so I didn&#039;t end up causing a mess of things too much. </p><p class="double">If he hadn&#039;t been, I would&#039;ve royally messed up.</p><p class="double">Still, Peter understood. His last non-Fused Loop had involved the &#039;Superior Spider-Man&#039; incident. He&#039;d needed a few Vacation Loops after THAT experience.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Having been a victim of something similar, I could completely sympathize. </p><p class="double">Peter had managed to improve some of his more...embarrassing moments.

Turning around to face Spike, she was surprised to see a familiar little filly in his stead.</p><p class="double">Nyx seemed as surprised as the local anchor. &quot;Mom? It&#039;s you?! Do changelings get cutie-marks in this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course it&#039;s… Wait, WHAT?!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Upon inspecting her body, the older of the two found she was covered in chitin. Most of it was black, but her back and the three strips on her chest were the same purple her fur usually was. She also got the typical convoluted horn of a changeling queen.</p><p class="double">But was she really one? She wasn&#039;t so sure of that. After all she didn’t got any hole in her legs, her mane and tails looked like what they usually does, her posterior was featuring a familiar star-shaped cutie-mark, and she seemed to be the same height as anypony else.</p><p class="double">As far as Twilight was concerned, that was too many mixed signals.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After a meticulous study of her loop memories, the (partially) purple anchor finally knew what she was and, more importantly, why.</p><p class="double">She accidentally switched species with Nyx when she hatched her.

Unluckily for me, I&#039;d found myself in a regular hive of villainy:</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gotham City.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">That meant I&#039;d encounter Batman sooner or later.</p><p class="double">And it was sooner, as during a usual heist, he showed up, spooking the Tartarus out of me when he did.

He is as good a fighter as the stories say he is.</p><p class="double">Since about every villain has a &#039;gimmick&#039; in this town, I decided to try gimmicks, plural. I used various looks and tricks I&#039;d picked up throughout the Loops to try and make it seem I was multiple villains, instead of just one person. I&#039;ll admit, the time where Spider-Man&#039;d used multiple guises during one particular incident where Spidey&#039;d been accused of murder was my inspiration for this endavor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">I created several guises: Kunoichi, the ninja thief, Key Keeper(my original guise using my Keyblade-based skills), Wild Flower(my martial arts training with Ranma), and Inverse(my magic abilities).</p><p class="double">This being Batman, he did figure it out eventually.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Unluckily for me, I was in Arkham Asylum(I&#039;d used the multiple personalities bit when Batman caught me as an explaination) when the Joker pulled off his legendary takeover of Arkham Asylum.

There are quite a few, you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The one covered in spikes, containing a spell which grants the caster dark magical abilities but which eventually drive them mad with power.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity rolled her eyes in exasperation. &quot;You&#039;re going to need to be a bit more specific.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The spell&#039;s called &#039;Inspiration Manifestation&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, <i>that</i> one.

So far the score is tied. Looks like they&#039;re suddenly talking to each other? What are they saying? Looks like Doofenshmirtz has taken out a remote. Now he&#039;s pressing a button. A green beam has just shot out from off-stage and hit Ditzy knocking her to her feet! This isn&#039;t looking good for Ditzy. But wait! She&#039;s getting up. She&#039;s looking really peeved now, and the audience loves it! Doofensmirtz is desperately fiddling with his remote and Ditzy is marching toward him.

The Elements have been on high alert this whole time!&quot; Celestia signalled her guards, who sent up a flare signalling the special contingent of guards in Ponyville to assemble Twilight and her friends and bring them to Canterlot. All the while the Wonderbolts flew down to ponyville, just to be tribly redundant.</p><p class="double">Luna prepared her most powerful offensive Spells and stepped beside her sister. &quot;You are going right back into the statue!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Lulu, Celestia, whatever did I do?

It&#039;s only a matter of time until I find you~.</i>&quot; She chanced a look around the curtain. Dead eyes stared back at her, Pinkie&#039;s mane rigid and unmoving, not a bounce in her. &quot;Gotcha.&quot; Pinkie giggled, bared her teeth and jumped for Rainbow&#039;s jugular.</p><p class="double">Right into Rainbow&#039;s right stump, onto which she had grafted an ice pick.</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s skull cracked, but she was undeterred. Rainbow leveraged her over her back and out of the window. &quot;<i>Puh...</i>&quot; She savored the moment&#039;s respite and reevaluated her chances.</p><p class="double">Twilight had been the first to go missing, no surprises there, as Pinkie knew she had to take out the Anchor first if she wanted to have any chance of succeeding. Applejack and Rarity followed shortly after and while Spike was gunning for revenge she thought she had the upper hand...</p><p class="double">Wholly unprepared for Fluttershy attacking her with an oaking chainsaw!</p><p class="double">After loosing her wings and narrowly managing to pop her attacker&#039;s head with a well placed punch that cracked her hoof she was ambushed by Pinkie, who capitalized on her already damaged hoof.

<p>90.1 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s voice had gone so hoarse it could have been used to polish glass. &quot;...ninety-eight... I am very sorry for being foalish enough to use a strange spellbook without asking Twilight first... ninety-nine... I am very sorry for being foalish enough to use a strange spellbook without asking Twilight first... one hundred.&quot; She flopped forward dramatically, legs splayed in exaggerated exhaustion. &quot;Water, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle levitate a glass over to Rarity. &quot;What really kicks me in the barrel is, I knew this was coming. I&#039;d seen what your baseline self did. &#039;Don&#039;t worry about it,&#039; I thought, &#039;Rarity is Looping this time. Surely she won&#039;t be so stupid as to read an obviously evil spellbook and get trapped by its subtle but insidious mental suggestion! She&#039;s married to a bucking JEDI, for elm&#039;s sake! She&#039;s smart enough to at least wait until Diamond is around to spot her for the Element of Generosity, in case things go wrong!&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike wasn&#039;t Awake this loop, darling,&quot; Rarity said, her voice still sandpaper-rough. &quot;It wasn&#039;t his fault. Ice cream, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Loop&#039;s ending in a few minutes. You can wait,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;But I think I need to bring this up with Sleipnir or some other friendly Admin the next time I run into one. I think you need a refresher magical course.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Darling, magic is your special talent, not mine,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;Oh, yes I can Ascend now, yes I have all sorts of Loop-learned abilities, but I really don&#039;t see the need to learn how to do more magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not the lesson I have in mind,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I&#039;m thinking of a school where they teach you NOT-&quot;</p><p class="double">And there the Loop ended.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity next Awoke in a baseline Loop with a stealth Anchor and an unAwake Twilight. She entertained herself by converting Equestrian fashion from clothing-optional, clothing-utilitarian all the way to elaborate steedpunk fashions in under three years. Even Applejack had seen the benefits of a slimming waistcoat, though the pockets she insisted upon rather ruined the effect.</p><p class="double">Thus, a few days after the end of the Foals and Fillies Faire, having mostly forgotten about her prior conversation with Twilight, she stood at a worktable idly sketching out designs and wondering what the next Loop would be like.</p><p class="double">And in a blink, with the usual disorientation of Awakening, she found out.</p><p class="double">The first thing she noticed was the Smell. It barged into her nostrils like a drunken uncle who&#039;s vacationing at your house for the week, has come back from the bar after midnight, and can&#039;t stop himself from smashing up half the contents of the living room because he&#039;s too proud to turn on the lights. Rarity&#039;s sense of smell shut itself down almost instantly out of shame and disgust.</p><p class="double">Next came the noise. Everyone around her was shouting and talking and swearing. Carts were pushing their way through dense crowds, rumbling across large, uneven cobblestones. Rarity&#039;s ears requested permission from the brain to join the nose in taking a coffee break, but her sense of self-preservation vetoed it on the grounds that smell was not important while in the middle of an immense crowd, but hearing was.</p><p class="double">The realizations that the immense crowd of market-day customers were humans, and that Rarity was yet another human member of the crowd(1), came in only third and fourth on the list of impressions.</p><p class="double">As Rarity waited for her Loop memories to come to her, she looked in front of her at the huge gates she stood before. The name of the establishment behind the walls was written in two places- once on a small, tasteful, modern plaque mounted next to the gate by the city, and again in huge, ancient letters in the arch over the gates.</p><p class="double">Unseen University.</p><p class="double">Well, that was ridiculous, wasn&#039;t it? Rarity shook her head at the absurd name. The rooftops of several buildings were visible above the walls, including a tall structure which might be architecture or geography or about to fall down in the next ten seconds, have your choice. <i>Worst. Kept. Secret. Ever,</i> she thought.</p><p class="double">Something pulled at her waist, just barely, just briefly. Rarity&#039;s hand flew to her belt, where a small coin bag had been and was no longer. She spun on her feet, seeing a mass of humans on criss-crossing paths and no clue as to which one had just clipped her purse.</p><p class="double">&quot;OooooooohhhhOOOOOHHHHhh!!&quot; Rarity shrieked in frustration, clenching her fists.</p><p class="double">Said fists glowed, and a quartet of small balls of light flew up from them, circled once around her head, and zipped down to ankle-level, making a beeline through the crowd. A moment later there came a loud fwoomp of flame, and a portly young man in what Rarity considered an objectionable derby leaped six feet into the air, shrieking with pain and shock, both hands clapped on the smouldering seat of his pants.</p><p class="double">Rarity marched over to the wounded man, staring down at him where he&#039;d landed on the cobbles. &quot;Oh ho!&quot; she shouted. &quot;I believe you have something which belongs to me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Beggin&#039; yer pardon, lady,&quot; the thief said, raising a knuckle to his brow and leaning forward. &quot;Din&#039; know you were from t&#039; University. &#039;Gainst Guild policy, stealin&#039; from wizards.&quot; He handed back both Rarity&#039;s coin pouch and a card declaring him to be William Lampwick, member in good standing of the Ankh-Morpork Guild of Thieves.</p><p class="double">&quot;I see,&quot; Rarity said, handing the card back. &quot;It is quite an understandable error; the University accepts very few female students or faculty.&quot; How had she known that? Were those Loop memories finally trickling in? &quot;But don&#039;t let it happen again!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I rather think I could say the same of you, miss!&quot; The crowd parted for a pointy hat, partly because most of humanity on the Discworld had learned on the instinctual level that not doing so was a risk to one&#039;s continued survival(2), partly because a wizard in a crowd often meant something interesting was about to happen, and Ankh-Morpork loved its version of street theater(3). Under the pointy hat was a florid face half-hidden in a beard that, despite being properly gray and quite full, put one in mind of a shrubbery in winter, covered with frost. &quot;Unauthorized use of magic is frowned upon most severely by the University!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I do beg your pardon,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;It was quite unintentional. It just... seems to happen...&quot;</p><p class="double">Ah, yes. Wonderful timing for Loop memories to return.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, well, I shall overlook it the once, as it was clearly provoked, and I hate to waste a good example,&quot; the large old wizard grumped, gesturing to the stricken thief. &quot;But I advise you to take greater care in future. The punishment for unauthorized use of wizardry is such as to ensure a lack of repeat offenders. And it would be my sad but unavoidable duty, as Archchancellor of this University, to see that punishment carried out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Archchancellor?&quot; The Loop memories had something to say about that. &quot;Would that make you Mustrum Ridcully?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, my mother and father made me Mustrum Ridcully,&quot; the Archchancellor replied. &quot;But that is my name, and I am the Archchancellor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then I have a letter of introduction for you,&quot; Rarity said, dashing across the cobbles and digging in the large carpetbag she&#039;d dropped at her feet(4) after she&#039;d had her purse taken. &quot;From a colle... er, an acquaintance of yours.&quot;</p><p class="double">The letter was a single page, folded at all four corners and sealed with plain tallow from a cheap candle. Archchancellor Ridcully opened it, turned it one way and then the other before deciphering the handwriting. Slowly, carefully, he read aloud:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;This is Rarity Belle of Ohulan Cutash. She has the wizardry magick. I can&#039;t be having with teaching magic to Loopy people what drops rocks on witches even if they are evil, so she&#039;s your problem now. I figure if your school took one girl you can take another. If you send her home I&#039;ll bring her back myself. Be told. Esmerelda Weatherwax.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">The wizard folded the little letter back up, carefully pulled a drawer open on the hat(5), deposited the letter, and closed it again. &quot;Impeccable credentials, Miss Belle,&quot; Ridcully said. &quot;As it happens this is the second letter of reference I have had on your behalf. However, as the first one came from a failed-out former student whose whereabouts are currently questionable(6), I didn&#039;t think much of it at the time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... I see?&quot; Rarity was a better liar than Applejack, but to lie well one has first to understand the truth.</p><p class="double">&quot;In any case, given the circumstances of your welcome to our fair city of Ankh-Morpork,&quot; Ridcully said, picking up Rarity&#039;s carpetbag, &quot;allow me to welcome you to Unseen University. Here are the rules: no being outside the gates after dark, no magic except under supervision until you graduate, no lectures unless absolutely unavoidable, and no getting between the Dean and the dessert trolley if you value your toes. There are some other fiddly little details, but you&#039;ll pick all that up as you go along.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... and you&#039;ll teach me how to do magic here?&quot; Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good heavens, no,&quot; Ridcully snapped. &quot;You&#039;ve just demonstrated you know how to do magic. No, Unseen University exists to teach wizards how to NOT do magic.&quot; He leaned forward and whispered softly enough to awaken hibernating voles, &quot;It&#039;s much harder than it sounds.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I see your point,&quot; Rarity said, remembering those balls of light... and remembering what she&#039;d done under the power of a certain spellbook.</p><p class="double">Still and all, she thought as Ridcully slapped her carpetbag into the arms of a bledlow just inside the gates and led her on into the courtyard, I owe Twilight a bit of payback when I see her next. This is such an overreaction for one little slip-up...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Meanwhile, five hundred miles away in the tiny kingdom of Lancre, Granny Weatherwax stared at the other girl from Ohulan Cutash with magic pouring out of her pores.</p><p class="double">&quot;... but the screaming didn&#039;t begin until I imagined up the giant weasel who kept putting humans down his pants. Then Twilight shouted at me, took the spell book away from me, and said she was going to add me to the list of something or other.&quot; She shrugged and continued, &quot;And then I Awoke here, shaped like a human, visiting my great-aunt Nanny Gytha.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s a devil of a baker, Esme,&quot; Nanny Ogg said, rocking in her chair, &quot;and she&#039;s as good with children as anyone I&#039;ve ever seen. But when she started talkin&#039; this mornin&#039;... well, I knew I had to send for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Granny Weatherwax couldn&#039;t rub her temples to ease the headache, not while people were watching. But that didn&#039;t mean the headache wasn&#039;t there...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(1) Still wearing the corset, bustle, ruffled blouse and skirts she wore in Ponyville just as the prior Loop ended, with minor anatomical correction, a fact which gave Rarity a brief sense of satisfaction.</p><p class="double">(2) At least, a risk to one&#039;s continued survival in a form possessing opposable thumbs, the power of speech, and eating habits that preferred pork chops on a plate to flies on a lilypad.</p><p class="double">(3) Unscripted, natural, and with an almost complete absence of greasepaint. The Patrician of Ankh-Morpork had Views on what passed for street theater elsewhere.</p><p class="double">(4) Which the other thieves in the crowd, having observed what happened to Lampwick, wisely left untouched.</p><p class="double">(5) Ridcully&#039;s hat was of his own design and mostly his own manufacture. He kept fishing lures attached to the brim. The drawers were for little sundries that he might want at one time or another. The tip of the hat unscrewed to reveal a small flask of brandy. As wonderfully useful as it was, the hat as a whole was such an offense to Rarity&#039;s sense of fashion that her mind refused to perceive it in any details other than &quot;pointy,&quot; &quot;broad-brimmed,&quot; and &quot;burgundy.&quot;</p><p class="double">(6) For those familiar with the broad literature about the Discworld, this notation places Rarity&#039;s arrival after <i>Sourcery</i> but before <i>Interesting Times.</i> Ridcully is only recently come into the Archchancellorship, For those not familiar with said literature, (a) we recommend reading the series(7), (b) the Discworld&#039;s Loop Anchor is Rincewind, a man who has raised cowardice, self-preservation, and running to such high arts that he is the only known Looper of more than a thousand iterations to have never, ever, EVER suffered death, and (c) Ridcully, while not a Looper himself, is the most open-minded and decent Archchancellor in generations(8), and thus understanding of temporal anomalies(9)</p><p class="double">(7) Particularly if you like clever footnotes in the style which these struggle to emulate.</p><p class="double">(8) A fact which in any other man would have given him a mayfly&#039;s life expectancy, except that Ridcully combined a mind like a steel trap, a body strong as a bull&#039;s, and a head harder than granite into one perfectly unkillable package- so unkillable that the previous wizardly tradition of advancement through stepping into one&#039;s predecessor&#039;s still-warm empty pointed shoes had gone from routine to unthinkable within a year of his election as Archchancellor.</p><p class="double">(9) &#039;Understanding of temporal anomalies&#039; is not the same thing as &#039;understanding temporal anomalies,&#039; which Ridcully didn&#039;t and didn&#039;t care to. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.2 (ScootaLewis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;STOP!&quot;</p><p class="double">Six Loopers Awoke, each momentarily disoriented as their loop memories asserted themselves.</p><p class="double">Six Loopers skimmed those memories to see where they were. The last thing they remembered had been Pinkie Pie&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">Six Loopers felt a ping from Twilight, confirming their numbers. They realized they were on a stage. It was Equestria, at least. Good, familiar Equestria. Less familiar were the instruments before them.</p><p class="double">Six Loopers recalled their current personas. Pink Valentine, the frontmare for the group, was of course scanning the crowd to see who, what and where they were playing for, which was apparently...Nightmare Moon. Twilight Nucleus was inspecting her guitar, eventually nodding as if to broadcast her comprehension of the situation, though inside she pondered the choice of instrument. Explosion World, the powder-blue unicorn, grinned as she recalled her ferocious drumming. She was pretty sure she could blow up something by the time they got off stage. Rainbow Da$hinal and Gil Da held guitars of their own, too, the gryphon clutching a scratched bass guitar and her adrenaline junkie pegasus friend grinning much like miss Trixie &quot;Explosion World&quot; Lulamoon at the sight of her rainbow-necked electric twanger. Finally, Apple Smörgåsbord sat looking confused at the grand assortment of keyboards she was apparently good at playing.</p><p class="double">Six loopers converged to discuss the situation. According to the loop memories, this was a variant loop where the Elements had become the musical instruments they held. It seemed they were expected to defeat Nightmare Moon through the power of friendship-infused rock. They had already gone through several &quot;band members&quot; before Awakening, which meant they didn&#039;t have true bearers for each Element. Something told Twilight that this shouldn&#039;t ought to work, but hey...when in a variant loop, do as the variations do. This was an idea every single one of them was okay with, and as such they returned to their positions opposing a still-stunned would-be villainess. She had frozen when Pinkie &quot;Pink Valentine&quot; Pie had shouted an impromptu time-out, and was still trying to fathom the brashness of the mere earth pony before her. According to some quick figuring by Twilight, a large enough concentration of Harmonic sound should create a blast strong enough to totally clean out Luna.</p><p class="double">Six loopers readied their instruments, holding a pose like an eternally-delayed conductor&#039;s baton. Pinkie &quot;Pink Valentine&quot; Pie uttered the time-in that fate had been holding its breath for.</p><p class="double">&quot;CONTINUE!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.3 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Cadence awoke and went through a quick checklist. Her hair was still pinkish red, that was good. She was human, and that was fine as well. She was shot and bleeding and on the verge of shock. That was less fine, but nothing a bit of healing magic and her own original alicorn nature couldn&#039;t take care of. </p><p class="double">She was being held in the strong arms of a rather dashing, if scuffed, gentleman. That was very good. </p><p class="double">They were inside what looked like a temple of some sort. Not the most romantic location, but there were worse.</p><p class="double">The man holding her glanced down at her no longer bleeding wound and then back to her face, &quot;So have you woken up yet?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m awake,&quot; Cadence smiled, &quot;So what&#039;s going on? My memories are kind of hazy after I was shot.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We managed to activate the elements of fire, water, earth, and air,&quot; said the old monk, Father Vito Cornelius. His eager assistant was looking on over his shoulder, &quot;But we are having some trouble identifying the fifth..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s love!&quot; Cadance blurted out, &quot;It&#039;s love. Oh my gosh, it&#039;s love! The hidden element is always something like love or magic, but this universe doesn&#039;t seem to have very strong magic. So it&#039;s love.&quot;</p><p class="double">The assembled group stared at Cadence. The man holding her gently set set her down until she stood on her own. She nodded and smiled, reiterating, &quot;It&#039;s love!&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she flung herself to the man named Korben Dallas, according to her new memories; and gave him the most passionate, most caring kiss the alicorn of love was capable of.</p><p class="double">By the time they separated, the world was saved and the great evil was stopped far sooner than in baseline.</p><p class="double">Dallas blinked as he recovered, &quot;Okay, Leeloo never kissed like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence smiled and shrugged, &quot;If I ever see her, I can give her some pointers.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, so tell me a little about yourself.&quot; Inside he was reassuring himself that Leeloo will probably be back next iteration, and hopefully they would both awake earlier in the timeline.</p><p class="double">Cadance&#039;s smile turned into a mischievous grin, &quot;Well, I&#039;m normally a pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A.. pony?&quot; Dallas was stunned. Cadance was giggling on the inside. Newish loopers were so much fun.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. A married pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Married?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I was actually kind of thinking of him when I kissed you. Sorry about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lucky guy.

Rarity huffed, &quot;Techtonium tea cups sounded like a good idea at the time!&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy looked at the large soap bubble that used to be Canterlot, &quot;Oops.&quot;</p><p>Twilight pulled out a notepad, &quot;Well, this one&#039;s new. <i>Ability to change large objects into soap bubbles</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sombra looked at the snow sculpture that used to be The Crystal Empire, &quot;Crystals?&quot;</p><p>Twilight frowned thoughtfully, &quot;Well, I suppose you could say snow is made out of ice crystals.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord looked at the perfectly organized filing cabinet that used to be a fish, &quot;Oops.&quot; Luna couldn&#039;t help but stare. &quot;I must say that I was getting a bit predictable for a moment there, but not even <i>I</i> expected that one.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, <i>what are you doing with that book?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">The fashionista looked at the scholar dryly. &quot;Trixie was able to master the Alicorn Amulet... eventually. Or at least get to a point where she could take it off at will. This--&quot; she thumped the Inspiration Manifestation for emphasis-- &quot;is <i>my</i> dark artifact from the baseline. If she can do it, why can&#039;t I?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Alicorn Amulet is just an emotional amplifier,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;The Inspiration Manifestation has an actual lock! You won&#039;t be released until--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Until true words are spoken, yes. That&#039;s why I&#039;m ONLY going to use this book when Spike is here with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to the dragon, who had the decency to look embaressed. &quot;Don&#039;t tell me you&#039;re encouraging this. Please.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; He fiddled his claws awkwardly. &quot;You know how when I first went Spikezilla I couldn&#039;t... exactly... control it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now you can because you.... practiced...&quot; Twilight groaned. &quot;But this is still different!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I have to master this spell! I just....&quot; Rarity sighed. &quot;How could I call myself a designer if I couldn&#039;t control the ideas and put them in proper places?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, just... Rarity, I... This is NOT a good IDEA.&quot; Twilight tried to come up with a good argument. &quot;At your... with all the loops you&#039;ve experienced, you could quite possibly crash Equestria before you got that under control!&quot;</p><p class="double">The white unicorn paused.</p><p class="double">&quot;...so... I should wait until I have Sleipnir on hoof?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what, I&#039;m going to teleport us all into the badlands, you&#039;re going to throw it into the lava, and you will Pinkie Promise NOT to go to the castle unsupervised ever again OR to teleport items out without supervision. Alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity.&quot; Spike put a claw on his wife&#039;s shoulders. &quot;I honestly think we should listen to Twi on this. I know... I know getting control means a lot, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, she let out a long sigh. &quot;...Alright, Twilight. I... I&#039;m sorry.&quot; She held the book out. &quot;I think I might have a problem....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.6 (EdBecerra)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was one of those quiet Loops where Celestia and Luna were both Awake and were chatting about past experiences.</p><p class="double">&quot;It was... quite different to be worshipped by humans, dear sister. Though I must admit, having tens, even hundreds of thousands proclaiming their love for me because I was dark was most endearing to me,&quot; Luna said softly. Then she giggled. &quot;I would gladly encounter such a loop again. &#039;Tis ironic they knew my title without knowing that they knew it. Being adored for mine skills is far better than being feared for my actions. &quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled knowingly. &quot;Being known for one&#039;s skill in entertaining is all well and good,&quot; she whispered back. &quot;But what is truly important is... what was <i><b>he</b></i> like? As hunky as he seemed?&quot;</p><p class="double">Their conversation quickly degenerated into giggles and things unfit for the ears of the innocent.</p><p class="double">Hey, semi-omnipotent beings thousands of years old? They take their fun where they can find it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Later that night, Luna entered her private quarters, set her wards, and erected a few shields against sight and sound that she liked to believe (well, hoped, actually) would keep her beloved sister from snooping.</p><p class="double">An ancient helmet made of platinum floated out from a hidden chest and came to rest upon her brow, replacing her tiara. She took a deep breath, and struck a pose. Inhaling deeply, she burst into song.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;ve got the stuff that you want</i></p><p><i>I&#039;ve got the thing that you need</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In her own bedroom, Celestia smiled fondly at her sister&#039;s antics. &quot;Eat your heart out, Whitney.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.7 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon awoke (small &#039;a&#039;) in the middle of the night to hear the sound of hooves repeatedly striking against wood. Yawning, Silver went to the window and peered outside: just as she&#039;d suspected, there was a familiar gray pony laying into the training log Zecora had set up for them.</p><p class="double">...Still, this wasn&#039;t normal behavior for the ninja who had become Silver&#039;s training partner and friend. She slipped outside the hut and trotted over.</p><p class="double">&quot;Kakashi? What&#039;re you doing up so late?&quot; Silver asked.</p><p class="double">His hoof paused in mid-strike, and now that she was close enough to see him properly in the moonlight, Silver realized that Kakashi&#039;s coat was matted with sweat.</p><p class="double">&quot;...It&#039;s nothing,&quot; he eventually replied, &quot;Go back to sleep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re a bad liar,&quot; Silver said, sitting next to him, &quot;How long have you been out here?&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi shrugged. When it became obvious that Silver wasn&#039;t going to leave anytime soon, Kakashi took a seat as well.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Did training with Naruto go badly?&quot; Silver asked.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been focused on Alchemy research today, since Kakashi was supposed to be working with Naruto on how to use chakra as a pony. Silver knew that she had to prepare herself for all kinds of ninja techniques, or Kakashi would flatten her the next time they sparred. But now Silver was starting to wonder if something had gone wrong.</p><p class="double">&quot;You might say that,&quot; Kakashi admitted, sighing, &quot;If by &#039;go badly&#039;, you mean &#039;I now compulsively try to murder one of my students on sight&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver&#039;s eyes went wide.</p><p class="double">&quot;We did all sorts of tests on it too,&quot; Kakashi continued, &quot;Naruto demonstrated all the non-human versions of her he&#039;s ever seen. Most of them trigger my new &#039;reflex&#039;. Twilight&#039;s trying to find a spell that will help, but nothing she&#039;s got will last past the end of the loop. Of course, either I&#039;ll kill an innocent version of her or the real one will kill me first, so Naruto&#039;s confident it&#039;ll work itself out <i>somehow</i>...&quot;</p><p class="double">Even in the midst of her surprise, Silver caught a hint of something...<i>familiar</i> in Kakashi&#039;s tone. Naruto was Kakashi&#039;s student in their baseline, and Silver had caught enough hints since the loop started that she&#039;d figured out that it was Kakashi&#039;s more <i>infamous</i> student&#039;s fault he&#039;d been...hurt.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you decided to beat up the training log until they figure something out?&quot; Silver pressed.</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s really nothing else I <i>can</i> do.&quot;</p><p class="double">And Silver recognized what she was hearing. She straightened in her seat. She might not be able to help with the big problem Kakashi had right now, but Silver could do something, at least.</p><p class="double">&quot;Kakashi, do you mind listening? I want to tell you about something from my very first loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">He waved a hoof absently, which she took as permission to go ahead.</p><p class="double">&quot;Before I started looping, my very best friend was a filly named Diamond Tiara. She and I did everything together,&quot; Silver said, &quot;We really were inseparable.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds nice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi was staring off into the darkened forest, sounding almost bored. Silver pressed on.</p><p class="double">&quot;And then I woke up in my first loop, and the Diamond Tiara that was my very best friend was gone. Instead, there was somepony I didn&#039;t recognize in her place. Somepony with the audacity to say that she was the <i>real</i> Diamond Tiara all along. As if the one I remembered was a fake! And she seemed to think I should just accept what was happening, because she&#039;d been looping for longer and knew so much <i>more</i> about what was going on than I did.&quot;</p><p class="double">She noticed that Kakashi was looking at her now.</p><p class="double">&quot;I told her I hated her,&quot; Silver continued, bluntly, &quot;I told her she was just a fake and that I wanted my <i>real</i> friend to come back. I was <i>horrible</i> to her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...What are you saying, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Kakashi,&quot; Silver answered, looking him dead in the eyes, &quot;I think part of the problem is that you&#039;re <i>angry</i> with your students...but you don&#039;t want to admit it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi recoiled like she&#039;d struck him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Naruto looked up as the door to the Ponyville Library swung open and Kakashi walked in. He was having Twilight go over every single weird gadget and gizmo in his pocket that he&#039;d forgotten the use of, on the off-chance that one might be helpful. No luck so far, unfortunately.</p><p class="double">&quot;Morning, Kakashi-sensei,&quot; Naruto said, waving a hoof, &quot;Want to lend a hand? I mean, a hoof? One of these things might be just the thing to fix you up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks for the offer,&quot; Kakashi replied, &quot;But I&#039;ve decided to work things out on my own.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, who had been in the middle of a magical examination of a strange gear-shaped key, turned her head. Naruto&#039;s jaw had dropped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, what? I mean, you don&#039;t need to be all macho here, Kakashi-sensei...&quot;</p><p class="double">The jounin lifted a hoof, interrupting him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me rephrase that: I don&#039;t <i>want</i> your help trying to fix this. I&#039;m just going to go spend the rest of this loop elsewhere...wandering around while working this out. On my own. Alone.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s such a good idea,&quot; Twilight began.</p><p class="double">&quot;Isn&#039;t this supposed to be a sanctuary loop?&quot; Kakashi countered.</p><p class="double">That stopped Twilight in her tracks. It was true, if he wanted to try to handle things on his own, then that was Kakashi&#039;s choice...she looked, saw how Naruto was starting to splutter, and decided to give it one last try.</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you spoke to Silver Spoon about this? She&#039;ll miss sparring with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She might, if she hadn&#039;t already volunteered to be my tour guide.&quot;</p><p class="double">He was eye-smiling now. Twilight couldn&#039;t help but smile back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then it sounds like you&#039;re in good hooves,&quot; she replied, &quot;But if you need anything at all, you only need to ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I won&#039;t forget.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I won&#039;t allow it!&quot; Naruto snapped, wings bristling, &quot;You only just got better! Give me one good reason to let you go running off!&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi struck a thoughtful pose.</p><p class="double">&quot;One good reason...&quot;</p><p class="double">He tapped a hoof against the floor for a moment, before making an &#039;ah-ha&#039; sound.</p><p class="double">&quot;...well, I <i>am</i> just a clone. Does that count?&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that, &#039;Kakashi&#039; popped into smoke. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.8 (MasterWeaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Apple Bloom glared at the purple mare. &quot;Seriously?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch glanced around the destroyed bar. &quot;Well, I don&#039;t often serve robots, and... she wandered in on her own, you should have seen her.&quot; She paused. &quot;I regret nothing, by the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t think that giving tha sapient suit of magitech powered armor that is soulbounded to a walking technological revolution <i>on tha anniversary of her wedding to her millennia dead husband</i> was a bad idea?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry raised an eyebrow. &quot;...walking technological revolution?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom summoned her Element with a flat expression.</p><p class="double">&quot;Still a bit arrogant.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah can <i>feel</i> the hangover!

That was an odd Loop. The Elements didn&#039;t come from the Tree. Instead, they were a bit like the Advisor Devices. Not the preserved souls of great heroes, but created by and named after them.

Havoc wreaked without even having to lift a finger. It was a beautiful thing.</p><p class="double">With a snap, Discord conjured a pair of sunglasses and a smoothie.

I&#039;m part-eagle, not albatross.&quot;</p><p class="double">The chaos spirit rolled his eyes (He got a fourteen.) &quot;Yes, yes, I&#039;ll play you a sad song on the world&#039;s most indifferent violin. I keep telling Louise she can do better, but does she listen? Of course not.&quot; He coiled himself up into a pile that put him eye to eye with the griffon. &quot;So, did you just come to ask me back in your refreshingly brusque way, or was there something else?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda flinched back for a moment. &quot;Why would there be anything else?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord smirked and quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Well, I was just being polite, but given that reaction, it&#039;s fairly clear there&#039;s something on your mind.&quot; Suddenly, he was in glasses, a hideous suit, and a chintzy armchair. &quot;Please, do share.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda found herself perched on another piece of furniture. &quot;Isn&#039;t this Rarity&#039;s drama couch?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t try to change the subject, dear. We&#039;re not here for me, we&#039;re here for you.&quot; Discord began doodling hypercubes on his notepad. &quot;Now, tell me about your father.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s... actually kinda what I wanted to talk to you about.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm. Trouble in the Empire?&quot; Discord scratched his beak. &quot;Is there one this time around? I rarely keep track.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that.&quot; Gilda tried not to think about how disturbingly attractive griffonized Discord was. &quot;It&#039;s... Look, did you create griffons?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Discord admitted, back in his usual shape. &quot;I&#039;ve had the occasional very early Awakening, and at times some or all of the mix-and-match species don&#039;t exist yet. Griffons, minotaurs, chimerae, et cetera.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Once, I even had to create pegasi! Naturally, the prototype was an attempt at Fluttershy, but she lacked a certain je ne sais quoi.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What about the baseline?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord paused. &quot;This is unusually existential for you, my fine, furred, feathered friend. What brought this on?&quot;</p><p class="double">No props appeared. He didn&#039;t change shape. There was nothing but seemingly genuine concern. It took Gilda the better part of a minute to process that before she could answer. &quot;It&#039;s just... Look, the ponies have a pair of sort-of-goddesses right there in Canterlot. Griffons don&#039;t, but we don&#039;t need some divine crutch.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sensing a &#039;but&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Besides your own?&quot; Gilda grimaced. &quot;Yeah, you&#039;re right. It&#039;s nice knowing where you came from, having someone you can ask and know you&#039;re getting the facts. Even when Celestia and Luna weren&#039;t there, ponies are...&quot; She trailed off, looking at her own talons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Go on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ponies are a big enough deal that there&#039;s always going to be some record or something. Like that Loop where you made pegasi. Bam. Primary source right there. But griffons...</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess it started when I was Ammy&#039;s student. Suddenly I had a goddess too. Suddenly it was griffons who were the big species on campus. But she didn&#039;t shape us from sunbeams in the baseline. I never really paid attention to the old stories, and now it seems like they change every Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see.&quot; Discord looked off into the distance. &quot;Does it really matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda squinted at him and tilted her head almost ninety degrees. &quot;No. I just poured my freaking heart out because I couldn&#039;t care less about this. What do you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">The draconequus nodded, keeping his gaze on the middle distance. &quot;Fair enough. Why does it matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because every Looping griffon says it does.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got Discord to reestablish eye contact. &quot;You&#039;ve talked to Silver Spoon about this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda rolled her eyes. &quot;I meant just me. Trying to be dramatic about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. Well, if you must know, I—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;DISCORD!&quot;</p><p class="double">They turned to see an incandescent Celestia. Discord provided sunglasses for everyone. Celestia&#039;s began to melt immediately. &quot;I&#039;m afraid we&#039;ll have to continue this conversation later, Gilda. It appears there&#039;s a fusion device about to go critical, and I&#039;m all out of blamable Trixies.&quot;</p><p class="double">And then Gilda found herself back in Ponyville, an afterimage of an alicorn seared in her vision and a pair of sweet shades darkening it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.12 (Conceptulist)</p><p class="double">It was not an unusual sight to see Vinyl Scratch sorting through her personal music collection, in search of the perfect song.</p><p class="double">“Erg! None of this sounds right.”</p><p class="double">However, it was unusual was for Vinyl to be dissatisfied with it. Normally she had the perfect music for any possible occasion. This time her standard fare just wouldn’t cut it.</p><p class="double">“Why, in the name of Wub itself, did I agree to DJ a birthday party for Angel Bunny!?!” whined Vinyl.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy had gotten Pinkie Pie to plan the Perfect Bunny Birthday Beach Bash. According to Pinkie, there was going to be carrot cake, and bunny balloons, and carrot flavored cotton candy, and a bunny bounce house, and all the cute bunnies Fluttershy could find were invited. As well as the not-so-cute ones. And the downright ugly ones. Pretty much any bunny Fluttershy could find had received an invite. It would be suffice to say that until all the party goers went home, the Everfree forest would be suffering from a severe lack of rabbit. The only thing missing from this Perfect Bunny Birthday Beach Bash? Music, and that&#039;s where Vinyl came into the picture.</p><p class="double">Vinyl Scratch started to rehash her mental list of music genres. “No dub step. No rock or any accompanying roll. No metal. Double no on death metal. Bunnies apparently find hip-hop offensive. Karaoke is for the birds, but Angel Bunny can’t sing. Bears hate smooth jazz, and there is no way I am letting an Unawake Fluttershy listen to any of the rap I got. Maybe classical, if Pinkie wouldn’t get bored with it and make me play nothing but the Pony Pokey for the rest of the party. Again. Nothing works!”</p><p class="double">Vinyl had already gone through all of her collection. Records, CDs, and cassette tapes were strewn all across her bedroom. It really was quite the mess, and Vinyl Scratch was not looking forward to cleaning it up. With a calculated blast of telekinetic magic, Vinyl cleared her bed off.</p><p class="double">“And worst of all, it’s a theme party! I just don’t have that much bunny-centric music on hoof!” she ranted.</p><p class="double">Vinyl hopped into bed, snuggled her pillow into her face, and proceeded to scream her frustrations into its downy depths.</p><p class="double">Once she was finished, she glared at that which had come to represent the source of her ire. A pair of floppy felt bunny ears that she was to wear at the party. How embarrassing for her. With an indignant huff, Vinyl rolled over and started to mutter to herself.</p><p class="double">“No good music. No alcoholic drinks. No way out of this, ‘cause I pinkie promise I would do it. And I’m gonna have to wear this stupid thing the entire time to ‘make the bunnies feel more at home.’ Ugh!”</p><p class="double">Vinyl rolled off her bed, plucking the bunny ears off her nightstand as she did so. In short order the bunny ears were securely on her head and she was sarcastically bouncing around.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Hey! Look at me! I’m the bunny DJ! Come on, let’s all bounce to the beat!&quot; she sang.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, right. I’m just going to wind up putting Little Bunny Foo Foo on loop or something, I just know it. I can’t find a single song that fits a bunny themed beach party,” the DJ complained.</p><p class="double">With a roll of her eyes and an exasperated sigh, Vinyl flopped back on to her bed.</p><p class="double">“I need something that will get everyone jumping and playing on the beach. Something that is going to make them stomp their feet to the beat. They gotta shake their bodies to a sweet little beat. And unless I write it myself, I got nothing that can do that!” ranted Vinyl Scratch.</p><p class="double">Her thought processes screeched to a halt in a way that was reminiscent of her name. “Write it myself?” she asked herself. “Why didn’t I think of that earlier!?!” herself answered.</p><p>Positively bouncing with creative energy, Vinyl rushed to find a quill and some paper. Mumbling potential lyrics and humming a beat, she began crafting a song.</p><p class="double">The unicorn composed well into the night. Creating a song from scratch was long and tiresome work, as long as a pony was not relying on the magic of Heartsongs to do it for them. However, the Muse was with Vinyl. A little after dawn, she finished perfecting the lyrics and stopped experimenting with the sheet music.</p><p class="double">“Finished,” yawned an exhausted Vinyl Scratch.</p><p class="double">Vinyl then started doing what earned her Cutie Mark. Etching music onto records.</p><p class="double">“Wait, what?” Mumbled a now slightly more alert unicorn.</p><p class="double">Looking straight ahead was pointless as there was a mostly blank record in the way. Looking up let her know that the record’s edge was currently aligned with her horn. A glow of magic was awash over both the horn and the record. The record was lazily spinning, with a groove slowly getting etched into the record.</p><p class="double">Vinyl blinked in surprise.“Nowhere near as weird as the stuff Derpy gets for a special talent.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">90.13(Novusordomundi, with Spectrumancer)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I can see your future!&quot; Pinkie stated, decked in her gypsy clothing, waving her hooves around a crystal ball while holding a deck of cards in her hooves.

Besides, wouldn&#039;t you just use your Pinkie-Sense?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled, while shuffling the cards like a Vegas dealer. &quot;I don&#039;t need Pinkie Sense to tell you your future...&quot; And with a flick of a hoof, she put down the card. One look, and she gasped...</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no, the The Repairman of Stars, in a reversed position! Something of yours is going to break in the near future, due to circumstances beyond your control...&quot; Pinkie gasped, than flipped over a second card...</p><p class="double">&quot;Trio of Quasars!

The Engineer of Judgment Day. Your machine will be destroyed in totality.&quot; Pinkie said in a serious voice, putting a hoof on Apple Bloom&#039;s shoulder. &quot;I mourn for your loss.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom just stared at the pink party pony as she removed the hoof from her shoulder. &quot;Pinkie, Ah don&#039;t want to sound rude, but if you think I&#039;m going to believe that something will happen to one of my devices just because you laid three cards on the table, than I&#039;m...&quot; She stopped when she felt the tap on her shoulder, and turned to see Scootaloo nervously standing next to her. &quot;Hey, Scoots.

And none of them knew to not press the red button yet?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom sighed. &quot;Alright.

This time around, one Ahsoka Tano. Yes, that means Anakin Skywalker was my teacher this time.</p><p>Out of all the Loopers so far, he could really sympathize with my baseline plight a lot. He did teach me how to better harness my emotions and finetune my telekinesis..as well as fly a spaceship. </p><p class="double">Anakin&#039;d actually been cooking up a plan for a good while when I&#039;d Looped in. His plan was to publicly expose Palpatine as the evil he was. </p><p>He was ready to give it a try, but my appearance threw him off. </p><p class="double">I did convince him to try the plan he had in mind, and find out the kinks in it.</p><p class="double">His plan was a simple one: After I&#039;d ended up in the same situation Ahsoka had which led to her ending her time as Anakin&#039;s Padawan, I&#039;d &#039;turn&#039; to the Dark Side..or just say I did. I&#039;d then gather proof Palpy was playing both sides, and once the final days of the Clone Wars arrived, Anakin&#039;d make his move, and expose Palpy.</p><p class="double">To both our surprises, it worked...though we had to use abilities from other Loops to do so.</p><p class="double">My time with Shinji and Ichigo&#039;d really helped in knowing how to outwit a master of manipulation like Palpatine. Anakin telling me how Palpy tended to do things also helped. </p><p class="double">When the plan was enacted, during the moment where Anakin&#039;d fall to the Dark Side in baseline, I&#039;d used some magic to be unseen, as Palpy thought me dead by Anakin&#039;s hand shortly before Dooku&#039;d been killed. We made the fight look VERY convincing, to our credit. I then saved Windu from his fall to the ground, and then helped Anakin fake the Jedi Temple slaughter.</p><p class="double">When Anakin apparently left to finish off the Separatist leaders(he&#039;d only pretended to leave), as Palpatine made his speech to the Senate as per baseline, I appeared. </p><p class="double">He acted the kind man, until I said the phrase that&#039;d cue the unveiling of Anakin&#039;s surprise.</p><p class="double">&#039;Hail Emperor Palpatine the mighty. Hail to Darth Sidious, conquerer of Jedi, darkest of Sith Lords! All praise the man who leads from shadows, lord over Count Dooku, and true ruler of this Galaxy!&#039;</p><p class="double">As Palpatine acted shocked by this insult, the video I&#039;d made of his revealing himself to Windu, as well as other evidence I&#039;d collected, caused him to act utterly shocked. When Windu walked in, Palpatine fumed. </p><p class="double">I then tossed an empty Senate box at him, forcing him to use the Dark Side to defend himself...the coward. </p><p class="double">Padme quickly acted, declaring Palpatine a traitor, and the Senate soon followed. You do NOT piss off politicians. Anakin then made his arrival, adding the final pieces of evidence: Palpatine&#039;s own words to try to turn Anakin. That did it, and Sidious attacked. </p><p class="double">Deciding not to hold back, I summoned my Keyblade, and the brawl was on.</p><p>The Sith Lord pushed me, Windu, and Anakin to the limit. </p><p class="double">However, the timely arrival of Yoda and Obi-Wan, who&#039;d learned of our masterplan right as it&#039;d begun, turned the tide. Anakin delivered the coup de grace, and goodbye Sith Lord...until the next time Anakin Looped. </p><p>I&#039;d enjoyed this Loop, as it allowed me to put both my combat skills and my skills at outwitting enemies to use. </p><p class="double">Anakin himself saw bits where only my abilities from my travels&#039;d allowed some of the plan to work, and was already cooking up ways to fix those holes. </p><p class="double">Anakin, I&#039;m glad I met you.

And then it can just drop into your Pocket.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know they&#039;re <i>possible</i>,” Spike confirmed. “But it didn&#039;t <i>have</i> them, Tiara was the one who did that abjuration set and they&#039;re only on the one she made.

He and Pikachu had been through a lot of time resets, but this was the first time they&#039;d ever been somewhere like this. &quot;I wonder where we are?&quot; he wondered as he went to move closer to Pikachu. Instead, he ended up tripping over his hooves, not being used to an equinoid body.</p><p class="double">Pikachu facepawed. &quot;How about you just stay here and get used to four legs while I go figure out where we are, alright?&quot; he asked. At Ash&#039;s agreement, he scampered off through the forest. As he exited, he saw what appeared to be a cottage of some kind on the outskirts of the forest. As he ducked down to get closer, he froze when a voice chimed in from behind him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my. I&#039;ve never seen anything quite like you before.&quot; As Pikachu turned around, he saw what looked to him like a pastel-yellow colored Ponyta with a pink mane that also wasn&#039;t fiery. The one thing that threw him off were the pair of wings on it.</p><p class="double">&quot;{I&#039;ve never seen a Ponyta like this before...}&quot; he muttered to himself in Pokespeak. He was shocked to find that the pastel not-Ponyta that spoke human tongue could understand Pokespeak when she said...</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s a Ponyta? Is that what you call Ponies? Well...to be more accurate, I&#039;m a Pegasus, although I don&#039;t really like flying,&quot; she, and it was definitely a she, said. &quot;I&#039;m Fluttershy; what&#039;s your name?&quot; she asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Pikachu,&quot; the electric mouse Pokemon said after a moment&#039;s pause. Unfortunately, since Pokespeak, for most Pokemon anyway, consists of a Pokemon speaking its name in different tones and stresses, it took him a while to make it clear to Fluttershy that he meant that his name was Pikachu. <i>&#039;One of these days, we need to figure out something so we&#039;re not confused,&#039; </i>he thought to himself.</p><p class="double">Anyway, just as he was about to say something else, a lavender not-Rapidash came onto the scene. &quot;Hello, Fluttershy,&quot; she greeted. &quot;Who&#039;s this?&quot; she asked as she turned to him. Strangely, her eyes widened for a second before she looked as though it had never happened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Twilight,&quot; Fluttershy greeted. &quot;I was just saying hello to my new friend.

I&#039;ve been working on an Animal Translation Spell and I think I&#039;ve gotten out all the bugs,&quot; she asked.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. &quot;Okay. I&#039;ll be inside if you need me; it&#039;s time to feed Angel Bunny,&quot; she added as she walked to her cottage and shut the door (softly) behind her.</p><p class="double">Twilight then turned to Pikachu. &quot;I guess Fluttershy isn&#039;t Awake if she didn&#039;t notice considering our visit there, but what&#039;s a Pikachu doing in Ponyville?&quot; she couldn&#039;t help but wonder.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what I&#039;d like to know,&quot; interjected Pikachu, much to Twilight&#039;s shock. &quot;Where am I? First time keeps resetting and not even Celebi or Dialga or even <i>Arceus </i>knows why, and now I&#039;m in a place with pastel colored not-Ponytas and not-Rapidashes? What&#039;s going on?!&quot; he wondered in frustration. He was getting fed up with trying to figure out what exactly was going on.</p><p class="double">&quot;A talking Pikachu?&quot; Twilight wondered before the rest of what he said registered. &quot;Wait; time has been resetting for you? You&#039;re a Looper?!&quot; she asked in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Looper? What&#039;s that?&quot; Pikachu asked in confusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay...imagine that every single world out there were branches on a tree, and that tree is the multiverse,&quot; Twilight explained. &quot;Now, imagine that something happened that almost broke the tree...&quot;</p><p class="double">Pikachu winced. &quot;That sounds bad,&quot; he commented. &quot;So if the tree that is the multiverse is broken, what&#039;s going on to fix it?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Time Loops,&quot; Twilight bluntly said. &quot;Looping stabilizes the Branches of the tree while repairs are made. But it&#039;s going to be several eternities before the tree is stabilized enough to even think about ending the Loops. The Admins, the quasi-divine upper-dimensional entities in charge of the universe, are working very hard just to keep things from getting worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pikachu whistled. &quot;Sounds daunting...&quot; he commented before a scream from the Forest cut him off. Pikachu paled beneath his fur. &quot;Oh crap! I left Ash in there alone while I went to scope the place out!&quot; he yelled in horror. He quickly dashed off in a Quick Attack, cutting off what Twilight was going to say.</p><p class="double">Ash tripped over his hooves as he tried to run away. He had no clue what was chasing him; it looked like someone had taken a Pyroar and fused it with a Bug-type of some kind. As he fell, the manticore, for that was what it was, got ever closer, causing him to scream for help.</p><p class="double">Just as the manticore was about to do...something...a yellow blur came out of nowhere. It was Pikachu, who had channeled the speed of his Quick Attack into a Double Edge, knocking the manticore back a good few feet. &quot;Ash! You alright?&quot; Pikachu asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;P-Pikachu! ...Yeah, I&#039;m fine,&quot; Ash said shakily. Pikachu then turned his attention to the manticore.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright! Listen up, whatever you are! You&#039;ve just made the biggest mistake of your life if you think you can go after Ash like that!&quot; Pikachu declared. <i>&#039;Wait...that sounded more like something Squirtle would say...oh well,&#039;</i></p><p class="double">The manticore growled before launching itself at Pikachu. Pikachu dodged, and immediately used Iron Tail to whack it in the stomach. But the manticore didn&#039;t give up, and let out a loud roar, that caused shockwaves in the air, knocking Pikachu backwards. The manticore then swooped in and attempted to stab Pikachu with its scorpion tail, but Pikachu performed a mid-air dodge and used Thunder Wave to paralyze the manticore. Just as he was about to launch into a Volt Tackle though...</p><p class="double">&quot;STTOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPP!!!&quot; was heard as Fluttershy ran up. However, much to Pikachu&#039;s chagrin, she immediately turned on him. &quot;You should be ashamed of yourself! Attacking Mr. Fluffykins like that out of nowhere...!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pikachu immediately started gibbering. &quot;{But...But...Ash...in danger...weird thing...attacking...!}&quot;</p><p class="double">Ash then chimed in. &quot;Um...it&#039;s alright, miss. Pikachu was just trying to protect me,&quot; he pointed out. Fluttershy deflated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh...well, the least you could do is apologize...I mean, if that&#039;s okay with you,&quot; she said.</p><p class="double">Pikachu rolled his eyes, but he acquiesced when Ash gave him a look. &quot;{Um...sorry, Mr. Fluffykins,}&quot; he awkwardly said. The manticore growled before flying off deeper into the Everfree.</p><p class="double">It was then that Twilight ran up. &quot;I heard a scream; is everypony alright?&quot; she asked, trying to deflect the Unawake Fluttershy from prying too far into this.</p><p class="double">Ash then spoke up. &quot;Um, we&#039;re fine, Miss..?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight realized then that they had never gotten her name. &quot;Twilight Sparkle. I gotta say, I hope it didn&#039;t get too <i>loopy</i> for you guys this <i>time</i>,&quot; she not-so-subtly said.</p><p class="double">Ash widened his eyes before nodding. &quot;Ash Ketchum. Pikachu&#039;s my best friend,&quot; he said as Pikachu leaped up onto his back, since trying to do so on his shoulder would be problematic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well then, Ash, Pikachu. Do you mind coming following me over to the town library? There are a couple of things I have to talk to you about,&quot; Twilight said. At the duo&#039;s agreement, they said goodbye to Fluttershy and walked with Twilight to the library. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">91.2 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The mist covered first the stage, and then the remainder of Ponyville&#039;s town hall.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, expecting the usual &#039;night shall last forever&#039; speech was surprised when the mist failed to dissipate in a timely manner. It remained thick and heavy in the atmosphere, still magical but with an almost familiar scent. The lavender unicorn only realized what it was when the ponies in the audience slowly stopped panicking and started acting more and more relaxed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, to all my pony subjects. I do hope we&#039;re all feeling irie tonight,&quot; said the Jamarecan accented voice. The mist cleared enough that Twilight was able to recognize the alicorn in the center. She was still black and midnight blue, but her flowing mane and tail were styled in ephemeral dreadlocks. She had on a bright shirt, a rastafarian hat, and there was a guitar and a steel drum strapped to her sides.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle sighed as she put a hoof up to her temple to try to stave off the oncoming headache, &quot;Let me guess. This time around, you&#039;re Nightmare Mon?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>91.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee--&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight lightly bopped Lyra upside the head. &quot;Yes, you&#039;re human. Get over it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think I recognize this loop,&quot; Cheerilee commented, looking around. &quot;Is it just a typical high school or--&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the loop memories hit.</p><p class="double">Lyra blinked. &quot;....okay, us being secret super spies I can get,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;But why do we wear spandex? And why does Twilight get the green one?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee shrugged. &quot;Super-hero clothing, I guess. Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there&#039;s some sort of tech involved...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>91.4 (Feral Wolfskin)</p><p class="double">Vinyl wasn&#039;t that unfamiliar with the concept of an apprentice; she often had one or two for any given loop... but this, she was sure, was a first.</p><p class="double">“So, Princess,” she began. “Why do you want to learn how to be a DJ?”</p><p class="double">“To be honest, I have never looped as a DJ, at least not meanwhile I was Awake, and it always looked interesting to learn – but, due to the fact I am one of the rulers of the country, it is difficult to find time to do it.”</p><p class="double">Vinyl blinked in confusion (No-one noticed, thanks to the sunglasses.) “But... aren&#039;t you one of the rulers this time, too?”</p><p class="double">Luna grinned. “Not... exactly...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked through a few documents, then said, “It only took them thirty seconds since the start of the loop.”</p><p class="double">“Wow, that must be a new record,” exclaimed Pinkie. “It looks that the Princesses really needed a vacation”</p><p class="double">“Probably, but they should at least have checked who was awake before they pulled this,” grumbled Rainbow Dash pointing to the still stunned Applejack. And the unconscious forms of Rarity and Fluttershy. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">91.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>The shops of Canterlot had seen many a strange thing in their years, even before those in the know factored in the loops. It was, after all, a hub to Equestrian culture and, due to the presence of two important entities in world-wide maintenance, a number of other cultures as well.</p><p class="double">Seeing two fillies bicker with an oddly lanky zombie insect pony over which dress was the most beautiful, though... that was a first to many minds.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m telling you, the one on the left has elegance! Look at that filigree, those gems--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course you&#039;d like the gems, Diamond. I&#039;m thinking she should go for that one, it&#039;s not too complicated but the way the shoulders swoop--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweetie Belle, I am not going to wear swooping shoulders on my date with Trixie! Maybe if I&#039;m playing up an evil sorceress thing, but--&quot;</p><p class="double">On the plus side, their argument was attracting a lot of attention to the shop and therefore generating retinue. The shopkeeper smiled a bit at their antics, totally unaware that they were two goddesses in potentia and the queen empress of the world&#039;s largest spy network. To him, they were just another group of shoppers in the big city.</p><p class="double">Of course, later that week when they fought Discord off with a shapeshifting crystal mech that weaponized music, his opinion would change. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">91.6 (Conceptulist)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Too short, but on topic and well written,” said Cheerliee. “B- for Twist.” </p><p class="double">Cheerliee was spending yet another day grading papers. A long and tedious job that she refused to try and shortcut with looping knowledge.</p><p class="double">“Definite problems with spelling, and little to no indication any attempts to fix it. D+ for Featherweight.”</p><p class="double">The only relief from this tedium was coming up with new assignments so she didn’t have to grade the same exact thing again and again.</p><p class="double">“No major spelling or grammatical errors, and it was an enjoyable read. A for Dinky.”</p><p class="double">It was boring being the only teacher in Ponyville, baring the occasional variant loop where that was not true. Sometimes it was frustrating to teach the same thing again and again. Sometimes she just wanted to quit and take a vacation from it all. Sometimes she did, if she could find a replacement teacher.</p><p class="double">“Diamond Tiara’s and Silver Spoon’s epic adventure of awesome? A for creativity.”</p><p class="double">But sometimes she saw what her student’s could learn to do. And she fell in love with teaching all over again.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Grammar Mane to the rescue!&quot; a spandex clad pony yelled, barging into what appeared to be an empty cave with several pieces of scientific equipment lying around. &quot;Do not worry my friends. I shall save you from the evil Miss Spelling and her minion Typo!&quot; Looking everything over, grammar mane was quick to spot the dreaded Miss Spelling. “Charge!” she both yelled and did.</p><p class="double">&quot;De apearatus has bean set,&quot; said the rival of Grammar Mane. &quot;You&#039;ll nevar stahp me now!&quot;</p><p class="double">Grammar Mane’s charge towards Miss Spelling was screeched to a halt. “Ah! Bad spelling! My only weakness!” she screamed, before collapsing to the ground. “How did you know?”</p><p class="double">“Like et is that hared to figure out,” quipped Miss Spelling. Grammar Mane twitched with every abused word she heard. “Let uce go ovar the facts.” More twitching from Grammar Mane ensued. “Farst, your name. Et is Grammar Mane. Ergo, you draw you’re strangth from correkt grammar.” Twitch-a twitch went the superhero. “Than yu allweighs avoided directly touching any of my pourly spell taunt notices. The one time you did, yuos got like thes.”</p><p class="double">Grammar Mane looked around the room while Miss Spelling continued to pontificate. There was nothing she hadn’t seen when she when she entered the room. No projectors beaming projections of misspelled words. No Comma-inators to reduce her movements to a jerking halt. Not even a single Un-Correction drone. But somehow she was still being rendered completely helpless. Grammar Mane despaired, as she was completely at the mercy of Miss Spelling. </p><p class="double">The only thing that was keeping Miss Spelling from finishing off Grammar Mane once and for all was Miss Spelling’s selectively shoddy memory. Miss Spelling always forgot whom she gave the “I know Grammar Mane’s weakness” speech to. This meant that, even if Grammar Mane herself was the one who asked, anyone asking about it was in for a long and detailed lecture explaining Grammar Mane’s allergy to poor grammar and bad spelling. And unfortunately for Grammar Mane, it sounded like Miss Spelling was no where near the end of the speech.</p><p class="double">“… And fur item number sixtea two, you nevar make a mistake in you’re writing. Almast like yu haft to…”</p><p class="double">‘<i>No,’</i> thought Grammar Mane. ‘<i>If she is only up to 62 and I have been reduced to a shuddering wreck already, I’ll never make it past 127. I’ll have to pony up and-’</i> here Grammar Mane was hit by a particularly bad series of tremors that interrupted her thought process and caused her too momentarily blackout. </p><p class="double">As soon as Grammar Mane came to, she cut the rest of Miss Spelling’s rant off by yelling “How are you doing this!” This caused Miss Spelling to smirk evilly. </p><p class="double">“You come all de way heir, and you had no idea what I waz building?” Miss Spelling rhetorically stated. With a vicious leer and widening of her evil smile, Miss Spelling rotated a dial on the control panel. “Wat a jok! Dis is fuknee. Oh sew vary funie. In fect, I tink ill jucet stert laghin now.” Miss Spelling took a deep breath, and began to laugh maniacally. </p><p class="double">“BWEHAHIHUHOHAHEHAHEOHIEHIAHEIHUHAHAHIAHHEHEHEHAAHAHAHEHAHEHEHA~”</p><p class="double">As the pain started to increase and Miss Spelling’s cruel laughter echoed in her ears, Grammar Mane came to a realization. ‘<i>Of course!’</i> she thought. ‘<i>But I shall need some supplies from my utility belt. I must prepare while Miss Spelling is still distracted.’</i></p><p class="double">“~HIAHAHAHIHEHEHEHAAHAHAHEHEIHUHEHAHEOHIEHA!” laughed the maniacal mare. Gasping for breath, Miss Spelling took a few short moments to rest. She soon was at Grammar Mane’s side, ready to continue the taunting of her heroic arch-nemesis. “Ded yiu fogiro et iot yut?”</p><p class="double">“Of course I figured it out,” answered Grammar Mane. “You used the stockpile of magitech equipment you stole to build a device that lets you misspell your spoken words.”</p><p class="double">“End new thet yu knew, I wall finesh yu!” Miss Spelling taunted, as she prepared to turn her machine up to eleven. Her hoof was moments away from making contact with the dial when a large rock slamming into the back of her head interrupted her. Staggering in a dazed fashion, Miss Spelling turned around in time to see a spandex-clad hoof right before it impacted her face.</p><p class="double">As soon as Miss Spelling could focus her eyes well enough to see, she realized that Grammar Mane was proudly standing on top of a large pile of scrap. “NOOO! The Vocal-Miss-Spell-inator 9001 was my penultimate creation! You should still be a gibbering mess on the floor. You should be dead by now. Where did you find the strength to fight back!?!”</p><p class="double">“I have no idea,” said Grammar Mane, before stopping to take some cleansing breaths.</p><p class="double">A twitch developed in Miss Spelling’s eye. “Impossible! My machine was flawless! There is no way you could have-”</p><p class="double">“What you just said,” continued Grammar Mane. “I can’t hear a thing. Aren’t earplugs just grand?” With a broad smile, Grammar Mane clapped a pair of hoofcuffs onto her gibbering arch-rival.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Cheerliee finished reading, she began to snicker to herself. “I just have to give writing assignments like this more often. I’m amazed at what the UnAwake CMC can come up with when properly motivated. A+.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">91.7: (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>999, Moonless age. What Would Captain Jack Sparrow Do?</i></p><p class="double">Cadance stood in Canterlot&#039;s throne room, trying to convince Nyx&#039;s parents that she really did have their daughter&#039;s best interests in mind.</p><p class="double">&quot;...And I really, <i>really</i> have no idea how she got wings!&quot; This was punctuated by a gesture behind her, to where Nyx lounged on the throne with a strawberry milkshake. &quot;This whole &#039;Luna reborn&#039; thing just happened after that! I&#039;ve been trying to shut that down, but it&#039;s already been spreading.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um.&quot; Lyra raised her hoof. &quot;That, might be my fault. When Cadance told us about her plans, I uh, I remembered that I overheard Twilight talking to Nyx last year, about hiding the fact she was an alicorn.&quot; Tugging at her collar, as the entire room turned its attention to her, Lyra continued. &quot;So, um, I thought, if one alicorn could claim the throne, two would make a better claim?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight knew about this?&quot; Twilight Velvet turned her attention to her younger daughter. &quot;Nyx, why didn&#039;t you ever tell us? How- <i>When</i> did this even happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">As Nyx looked downcast at Velvet&#039;s hurt tone, Nightlight spoke up in her defence. &quot;Now dear, don&#039;t blame Nyx, I know what happened.&quot; Making an odd gesture with his hooves, he smiled as his wild mane seemed to twitch. &quot;Moonponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Though correct in ways he didn&#039;t know, his argument fell flat. Any counter arguments, however, were cut off by a loud banging on the throne room doors. As the guards and Mooncultists turned to face the doors, on the third bang, they came crashing off their hinges.</p><p class="double">Standing in the now open doorway, was Twilight Sparkle. She had a crown on her head, a large sledgehammer hanging in her magic to her right, and a cowed Flash Sentry held to her left. Flanking her, was a group of ponies that some present recognized from Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance! In accordance with the charter for the Celestia&#039;s School for Gifted Unicorns chapter of the Cult of the Moon, I must inform you that <i>this is a coup!&quot;</i> Twilight declared, setting the sledge&#039;s head on the floor, and posing with one hoof on the handle.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is the part where she defeats you.&quot; Cadance could just hear Nyx say from the throne.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is the part where I defeat you.&quot; Twilight continued to ham it up across the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;With magic.&quot; Nyx said, taking a sip of her milkshake.</p><p class="double">&quot;With Magic!&quot; By now, the bystanders were quickly clearing a path between Twilight and Cadance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh heh. Um. Parley?&quot; Cadance asked, as Nyx hopped off the throne to get clear.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>1000th year of The Exodus. Heading off to Iskandar.</i></p><p class="double">Eternal night all around it, the Moon shone in the sun, as it sailed towards its homeworld. At the bow, the mighty shield produced by the Prow shimmered as it deflected space dust. On the side of the Prow, a pair of Lunar Navy marines stood watch on a balcony.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey.&quot; The maroon batpony cought the attention of his fellow gaurd.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah?&quot; The orange earthpony replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;You ever wonder why we&#039;re here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s one of life&#039;s great mysteries, isn&#039;t it? Why are we here? Are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a Yggdrasil? Watching everything; you know, with a plan for us and stuff? I don&#039;t know colt, but it keeps me up at night.&quot;</p><p class="double">As he finished speaking, the maroon pony could only stare at his friend. Following an akward silence, he finally replied. &quot;What? I meant why are we out here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I... yeah.&quot; It was the orange one&#039;s turn to stand akwardly.</p><p class="double">&quot;What was all that stuff about Yggdrasil?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, hm? Nothing&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You wanna talk about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">Taking the hint, the maroon one switched back to his original topic. &quot;Seriously though, why are we out here? What&#039;s the point? What could we possibly see coming, that the sensors wouldn&#039;t? Who could get close enough to the Prow to do anything to it, assuming they got through the armor and force fields?&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>CLANG</b></p><p class="double">The orange one&#039;s reply was cut off by the entire shield flashing with color, and a resounding noise that everypony on the Moon must have heard.</p><p class="double">&quot;What the buck was that?!&quot; They both cried.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ruby Pinch was a good filly. She helped Mom around the bar, made sure she got up when she got back from school, so she&#039;d open on time, and often helped cooking dinner.</p><p class="double">So when everything went <b>CLANG</b>, she did what any responsible filly would do, and started looking around to make sure nothing broke. After making sure her groaning mother was okay on the floor, she started looking through the rest of the apartment they had, above the bar.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cadance came to on her back. There was a hole in the ceiling above her, going clear through the second floor to the sky. It was night, wherever she was, but oddly enough the sun shone through the windows to her left. There was a filly looking at her through the hole. She had a rosy coloured coat, and the most adorable tufts on her ears.</p><p class="double">They stared at each other for a moment, before the filly ran off, little bat wings flapping. As Cadance&#039;s thought train was derailed by the bat wings, she heard the filly shout from somewhere above her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mommy! Somepony broke into the bar! And there&#039;s a big hole in the roof!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silence reigned, in the aftermath of the fight. There was a hole in the ceiling, Cadance was gone, and somewhere along the way Twilight had grown a pair of wings, just like her sister.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now then,&quot; Twilight addressed the room, &quot;Unless there are any complaints, I will now assume command of the Cult.&quot;</p><p class="double">Various versions of &quot;No, Ma&#039;am.&quot; echoed from the places the Cultists had taken cover in. Lyra poked her head out from the guardpony she was hiding under.</p><p class="double">&quot;If I may, Supreme Cult Leader, do you have any orders? Um, the baguette wasn&#039;t our idea!&quot; Lyra ducked back under the guard, as Twilight turned her attention towards her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well for starters, I&#039;d like to know what happened to Princess Celestia.&quot; Twilight looked around the room, waiting for an answer.</p><p class="double">Her answer, instead, came from behind her. A familiar voice, though it hadn&#039;t been heard in Equestria in a thousand years echoed through the door. &quot;Hard to port!&quot;</p><p class="double">As they all looked towards the door, the more familiar voice of Princess Celestia replied, with repressed laughter. &quot;Where&#039;s the port?&quot;</p><p class="double">As they entered view, they said together, &quot;We drank the port!&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna, wearing a double breasted navy blue longcoat, and Celestia&#039;s crown, poked the guardpony walking beside them, as they laughed. &quot;Port&#039;s a kind of wine, y&#039;see.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia, wearing a plumed bicorn that matched Luna&#039;s coat, stopped short, looking at the room she was about to enter. Beginning with the doors, she looked across the various ponies poking their heads out of hiding places, Twilight and Nyx&#039;s wings, what she recognized as the Elements of Harmony, and the hole in her roof, finally ending at the sledgehammer embedded in her throne.</p><p class="double">Blinking owlishly, she asked her little ponies, &quot;Did we miss something?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">91.8 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">They found Catscratch on the outskirts of town. A purple pony with long black hair. Her cutie mark was a grinning cat&#039;s face. She stood in front of a chorus of mice with a microphone planted in front of them. Most unusually, she wore a plush mouse on her head.</p><p class="double">Kagura walked up to her. &quot;Hey Catscratch.&quot;</p><p class="double">Catscratch nodded. Then she nodded to her mice, which seemingly took the gesture as their cue to take five. As the mice wandered off, Kagura struggled to form words.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are you wearing that?&quot; she finally managed to squeak out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Solidarity.&quot; Was her one word reply.</p><p class="double">Again struggling to find the words, she suddenly brightened and turned around to the rest of the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;I want you to meet some ponies.&quot; She waved the rest of the group to come.</p><p class="double">&quot;The rest you know, but this is Chiyo and Spike.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot; Said Chiyo as she gave a short bow.</p><p class="double">Catscratch nodded.</p><p class="double">Tomo ribbed Chiyo in the side and whispered. &quot;Ask her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;About what?&quot; Was Chiyo&#039;s confused response.</p><p class="double">&quot;About if she wants a human name.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! We wanted to know if you wanted a human name. Its a fad going around right now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Catscratch nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, how about Sakaki?&quot; </p><p class="double">There was the faintest of blushes from Sakaki, and she nodded again.</p><p class="double">&quot;What! Come on! You too? Everypony likes their human names just like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hush!&quot; Said Yomi, bopping her friend on the head.</p><p class="double">Spike coughed and spoke suddenly. &quot;Anyway, we&#039;re representatives of Princess Celestia, checking on the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. So you prepared singing mice?&quot;</p><p class="double">Catscratch nodded again and tapped her foot. The mice reassembled and scampered on stage. At another gesture from Sakaki, they started singing what could only be described as an upbeat melody, followed by a few others.</p><p class="double">Everypony stamped their hooves in appreciation. Tomo, however, had the question.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know you like cats Catscratch, so why did you choose mice?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cats can&#039;t sing very well.&quot; Said Catscratch plainly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>91.9 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;So, Ditzy, I was wondering if you were Awake?&quot; Twilight asked, as nonchalantly as possible.</p><p class="double">The mailmare stopped in her letter sorting and gave the anchor an odd look. &quot;Of course I&#039;m awake, Twilight.&quot; Her head tilted in an absurdly unsettling way. &quot;<i>I&#039;m always awake.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Twlilight clicked her tongue. &quot;Yeah, not what I meant.&quot; Honestly, how many nightmare-fueled versions of her bright-eyed friend <i>existed</i> in the multiverse? &quot;I was wondering if you were experiencing the same period of time over and over, in a loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; And suddenly Ditzy was just Ditzy again. &quot;Well no, but that does sound interesting. I&#039;m sorry if I can&#039;t help because I&#039;m not, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Aaaand sad Ditzy makes the world cry. Best head this off at the pass. &quot;Oh no, I was actually hoping you <i>weren&#039;t</i> so you could help me with an experiment. The next time you&#039;re Awake, I&#039;m going to ask you if you remember &#039;the experiment&#039; and if you remember this, I want you to answer yes and tell me everything you can remember of this conversation, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">She scratched her chin. &quot;That sounds <i>really</i> weird, but I&#039;ll try!&quot; And with that she went back to work.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to herself as she went back to check on her other projects. One of these days she&#039;d pin down the specifics of these different &#039;Dreaming Bugs&#039;. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">Well, this is interesting, if more than a little unsettling...</p><p class="double">I appear to be Major Kira Shimsun, Bajoran liason to the Federation starbase designated Deep Space Ninie.</p><p class="double">Ranma-sensei and Harry told me about these loops: The native loopers are so good at not showing their status that nopony knows for sure just who is and who isn&#039;t Awake. The supposition is that the main characters for each series have to be looping, but without proof...</p><p class="double">I might as well be alone in the universe.</p><p class="double">I wonder if this is how Twilight feels when she&#039;s anchoring a lonely loop.</p><p class="double">No. Looping or not, these are real people, and I shouldn&#039;t hold myself aloof just because I may never see them again after the loop ends. After all, I&#039;m probably going to spend several years here unless something really strange happens.</p><p class="double">Anyway, after a bit of a rocky start with Commander Sisko, we seem to be settling into something that might evolve into a decent working relationship.</p><p class="double">Chief O&#039;brien is a solid friendly sort.</p><p class="double">Dr. Bashir, while clearly a skilled physician, is a bit of a twit.</p><p class="double">I could probably get to like Jadzia Dax, but that whole symbiote thing creeps me out.</p><p class="double">I&#039;m not sure, but I think Odo may have a crush on me.</p><p class="double">That Quark character reminds me of Snips, but craftier and nowhere as sycophantic.</p><p class="double">Idle thought: I wonder how my keyblade would interact with that wormhole...</p><p class="double">Since this is a tech-heavy, low-magic loop, I&#039;ll take the opportunity to get a handle on advanced science and engineering.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Addendum:</p><p class="double">New loop, but there was something about the end of my tenure on DS9.</p><p class="double">The day after Sisko&#039;s final journey to Bajor, I found an anonymous text message in my personal account.</p><p class="double">&quot;We apologize for not being more supportive during your visit. We appreciate your contributions, and under different circumstances, would welcome your company at any time.&quot;</p><p class="double">I don&#039;t think I was especially friendly, but I guess I was able to mesh pretty well with the station inhabitants after all.</p><p class="double">Anyway, I need to talk to Harry Dresden about those two murders. More about this loop later. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">91.10 (Bigou)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh was setting up his bar for the loop when Discord brutally entered, almost tearing the door from it&#039;s hinges. The chaotic being walked to the counter, so pissed that each of his steps was imprinted in the floor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Give me the blandest and dullest drink you got!&quot;</p><p class="double">The scene happening in front of him terrified the red stallion so much that he was unable to even comprehend what was expected of him, or even that something was expected of him. So he stared open-mouthed.</p><p class="double">Faced by the lack of drink, the spirit bellowed &quot;WATER! GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER!&quot;</p><p class="double">Freed from is paralysis, but still trembling, Big Mac delivered the requested drink, then ducked under the counter.</p><p class="double">As soon as Discord&#039;s paw touched his glass, his head exploded in a loud &quot;<b>BOOM!</b>&quot; that will have made Trixie proud.</p><p class="double">The bartender timidly pocked an eye out of hiding. Beside tiny bits of draconnequus head plastered everywhere, the bar wasn&#039;t suffering and damage.</p><p class="double">&quot;D-do ya want ta sp-speak o-of it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord snapped his talon, making him whole again.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I don&#039;t. But I need to talk about it! Say Big Guy, have you ever wondered what Equestria would be if it was inhabited by draconnequii instead of ponies? And be honest, please.&quot;</p><p class="double">The red bartender reflected on the question, lightly taping his chin. &quot;Nope. But now that ya ask…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I used to, before my last loop. ʻ<i>In the wonderful land of Draconnequat, every draconnequii lived in chaotic harmony, bla-bla-bla!</i>ʼ At first glance that variant of Equestria seems like a paradise tailor-made for good old me, don&#039;t you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er… Yup?&quot; Was Mac&#039;s unconvinced reply.</p><p class="double">&quot;It might have been, if I didn&#039;t Awaken as the only pony. No scratch that, If it was only a species problem it wouldn&#039;t have been a problem. Awakening as Check List, the spirit of <b>order</b> and disharmony… And by order, I mean <b>excessive</b> order!&quot;</p><p class="double">The apple farmer was able to think on only one appropriate reply: &quot;Ouch!&quot; So that&#039;s exactly what he said.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hate to admit it, but without Twilight&#039;s help, I probably would have lost my sanity…&quot;</p><p class="double">At that last statement, Big Mac preferred to stay mute. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>91.11 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke to chaos. A flock of waffles flapped through a key lime sky. Clods of earth and of social ineptitude drifted past her, untethered by gravity or etiquette. A fully grown dragon cartwheeled across the edge of her vision.</p><p class="double">She took this all in before saying, &quot;I was wondering when this would come up. Okay, Ditzy, let&#039;s… huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">Only then did Twilight realize she hadn&#039;t Awoken while casting any kind of defense against the madness, and she immediately saw why. Her immediate surroundings were as gray and lifeless as a Discorded Cheese Sandwich. Looking closer, she saw some variety in the ground cover — grass, playing cards, four-dimensional seashells — but it was uniform in color and motionlessness. &quot;Well, this is interesting. What are you doing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy looked at the golden glow playing along her horn. &quot;Right now, I&#039;m just maintaining whatever this is. Still getting my Loop memories. What&#039;s going on, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This happens whenever an adult pony becomes an alicorn. We have a Loop where we take Celestia and Luna&#039;s place. We have to defeat Discord, rebuild Equestria, and so forth.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy swallowed. &quot;Oh. Um. Well, I guess I&#039;ll have you helping me.&quot; She perked up as her memories hit. &quot;Oh, that&#039;s clever! Okay, so Discord generates chaos, but it&#039;s high-energy chaos. I used my entropy powers to force right here to a lower energy state, so it&#039;s more stable.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Interesting.&quot; Twilight mulled this over for a bit. &quot;Do you think it&#039;ll do much good against Discord himself?&quot; She winced as her own memories hit. &quot;Okay, wow. Never mind. I don&#039;t think you want your name eaten again. Let&#039;s just go get the Elements.&quot; She threw up her own chaos shield and trotted in the direction of the Tree of Harmony, this part of the Loop well-practiced. &quot;Which ones do you want?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, whichever ones you don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paused and looked back. Ditzy offered a weak smile, but her nervousness was clear in her fidgeting wings and twitching tail. Twilight walked back and spread a wing over the younger Looper&#039;s withers. &quot;It&#039;ll be okay, Ditzy. I&#039;ve done this before. This is the easiest part, and I&#039;ll be right there with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry. It&#039;s just…&quot; Ditzy waved a hoof across the madhouse reality.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, it&#039;s a lot to take in.&quot; Twilight started moving again, and Ditzy followed her. &quot;So, going by that one variant where Trixie and I switch lives, you&#039;re a shoe-in for Kindness, and you should definitely get Laughter, because you make about as much sense as Pinkie Pie. What else?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy screwed up her muzzle in thought. &quot;Well, you get Magic, of course. And taking Generosity seems kind of silly. &#039;Gimme that, I&#039;m generous!&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ditzy, you&#039;re one of the most selfless ponies I know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, you can say that, but I can&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You do realize that the more you insist I take the Element of Generosity, the more you convince me you should have it, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just don&#039;t want to disqualify myself, is all.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, but smiled. Ditzy barely even seemed to notice the madness around her. &quot;It doesn&#039;t work that way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, you say that now…&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy considered the Elements in her magical grasp. &quot;Didn&#039;t that Link pony have a bunch of these?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Just be glad they aren&#039;t necklaces. This usually looks ridiculous.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Discord?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord, Master of All He Feels Like, Spirit of Chaos and Disharmony, Who Makes Brave Sapients Call For Their Brown Pants, looked up from his throne. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; He smirked as she saw his supplicant. &quot;Well, what do you know? I think I actually can help you. Put that ludicrous idea of rebellion out of your silly horned head.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy returned the most gormless expression she could muster. &quot;I thought you liked ludicrous ideas.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only when I have them, dear.&quot; Discord ran a leonine finger down the alicorn&#039;s cheek. Then, when there was no sign of desaturation, he frowned. &quot;I&#039;m not even sure if that worked. Is that ginger ale nebula of yours usually that shade?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy considered her effervescing mane and shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, aren&#039;t you helpful? I suppose a taste test will settle matters.&quot; Discord produced a tap and stuck it into the ephemeral hairdo.</p><p class="double">It popped, as did the alicorn attached to it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now!&quot;</p><p class="double">The resulting statue had a much more befuddled expression than in the baseline.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath. &quot;Okay, this is where it starts getting tricky. We need to decide how we&#039;re going to divide the diarchy. And every time, the other alicorn has gone Nightmarish.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s why you wanted me to think of my evil self earlier.&quot; Ditzy chuckled. &quot;I thought that was just for stress relief or something.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grimaced. &quot;Not a good idea. Remind to tell you why it took me so long to discover Big Mac was Looping. Anyway, division of labor. Your thoughts?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy pondered this for a time. &quot;Okay, so Luna went bad because nopony was awake. What if we each got half of the day and half of the night?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. That could work.&quot; Twilight considered it. &quot;Switch off at the zeniths? Noon and midnight? Though it&#039;d mean a weird activity cycle for both of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy drooped a little. &quot;Bad idea, then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I never said that. I&#039;m willing to try it if you are.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Amazingly enough, the system was working for once. Ditzy&#039;s midnight-to-noon shift meant she saw relatively little activity, but still enough to build some ruling experience. Better yet, she showed none of the expected warning signs: her bubbly personality never went flat, she didn&#039;t take on the entire post office&#039;s workload, and she never tried to subsidize muffins into a nationwide staple.</p><p class="double">Twilight was grateful for this, as she had enough problems as it was.</p><p class="double">Ditzy may have been staying sane, but she was still Ditzy. She simply didn&#039;t have much experience with two-thirds of her magic, which meant that the castle was subject to catastrophic miscasts, wall-toppling faceplants, and the occasional ruinous maelstrom for variety. Thunderclouds were now outlawed within a mile of the palace.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t like Ditzy made the same mistake every time. There was no teacher like experience, and no experience like bringing a palisade down around one&#039;s ears. She got the hang of sunrise and moonset quickly, but her magic kept finding new and exciting ways of going horribly wrong, and always at the worst possible times. Twilight couldn&#039;t help but think of her forays into computer programming; one misplaced parenthesis and the east wing was reduced to rubble.</p><p class="double">Worst was how, more often or not, the mishap rendered the rubble resistant to reconstruction magic. That meant resorting to manual labor, and that came with other costs.</p><p class="double">One day, Twilight found she had to do something drastic. She confronted her co-sovereign at lunch. (Well, lunch for their subjects, breakfast for her, and dinner for Ditzy.) &quot;Ditzy, I&#039;ve run the numbers.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;About what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight heaved a heavy sigh. &quot;It&#039;ll actually be cheaper to build a new, less destructible castle than repair this one again, but either way, that&#039;s all we can afford. One more disaster in the next forty years, and Equestria will officially be owned by carpenters and masons.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Ditzy&#039;s gaze dropped to the floor, on average. &quot;I guess I&#039;m getting banished to the moon until the economy recovers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think we need to do something that drastic... though you will be spending a lot of time on the moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh.&quot; The hope drained out of Ditzy&#039;s voice. &quot;So, what will you call it? Abeyance? Dormancy? Quiescence?&quot; She gave a humorless little chuckle. &quot;I like quiescence. It has a nice flow to it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight crossed the table and wrapped her wings around the other princess. &quot;Nothing like that, Ditzy. I was thinking… Have you ever had a Dragonball Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">A little light came back to Ditzy&#039;s eyes. &quot;I Woke up on planet Vegeta as a naturally blonde Saiyan, including the fur on my tail. They&#039;d been all but worshipping me.&quot; She let out a giggle. &quot;It was really awkward. I was saving it for the next time we were all together in Mac&#039;s bar.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, think off this as a training journey. You can go to the moon, make a few new craters, and fine-tune your alicorn magic. I&#039;ll check in regularly. How&#039;s every year sound? We can even make a holiday out of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy considered this for a time. &quot;Space it out a bit more. There&#039;s a lot of bad stuff out there still, and whatever you&#039;d name the holiday, they&#039;d call it Invasion Day. Make it every twenty.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twenty years is a long time. I don&#039;t want to have to actually banish you because you went mad from the isolation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy septupled. &quot;I think I&#039;ll be okay,&quot; they chorused. Ditzy reunited herself and gave a genuine smile. &quot;Besides, that way, you can introduce me to a new personal student each time. I know you love taking them on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled a little. &quot;It&#039;s a deal.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The announcement was made by both diarchs, standing together as co-rulers and sisters. All but the most outlandish rumors of a coup died then and there.</p><p class="double">On the next day&#039;s sunset, Princess Ditzy of the Wee Hours and the Morning spoke to her subjects for the last time in generations:</p><p class="double">&quot;My little ponies, know that I love you all, and that I will keep watch over you even as I learn all the ways my power can go wrong. With one eye, I will watch my sister guide you with wisdom and grace, and I will watch you grow and flourish, love and learn, rise like bubbles on the breeze and never pop. With the other, I will watch those who think you weak and foalish. I will watch them fail time and again, succumbing to their own inner strife and your inner strength. And if they would claim a moment of fleeting triumph, if by some ill fate they would overpower you with brute force and hatred, then I will launch myself from the moon and strike them down like a falling star.</p><p class="double">&quot;Be strong, my ponies. Shed no tears. I will be back among you soon, and so I say not goodbye, but farewell.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight began the transition from day to night. As the moon rose, a bubble of Ditzy&#039;s magic enveloped her and streaked toward the satellite. Some wept despite her entreaties. Some cheered and stamped the ground for the future. Twilight did both.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twenty years later, a heliotrope flash placed two ponies and an atmosphere pocket on the moon. One, a white, pale-gold-maned filly on the cusp of marehood, looked around with naked astonishment. &quot;She must be so lonely.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;I&#039;m very proud of you, Wondrous. I had been wondering what you would do first when we arrived.&quot;</p><p class="double">Wondrous Item returned a smaller, more embarrassed smile. &quot;You expected me to go straight to gathering samples, didn&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">The princess bobbed her head from side to side noncommittally. &quot;I wouldn&#039;t have been surprised. And you are, of course, welcome to collect some moon dust for your studies.&quot; She lit her horn and swept it about before locking onto the familiar magical signature. &quot;She&#039;s close. Remember to stay near me. The air pocket only extends so far.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two trotted over the regolith, a snowshoe enchantment keeping them from sinking in. Well, Twilight trotted. Wondrous Item delighted in the lower gravity, pronking like a party pony. The princess had to pull her student back from the edge of the air pocket a few times, but she couldn&#039;t bring herself to scold her student for feeling the joy of discovery.</p><p class="double">Soon enough, they came to a surreal structure. Wondrous Item would&#039;ve seen it as an affront to royal dignity had a royal not made it. Twilight immediately recognized it as a replica of Ditzy&#039;s house in Ponyville made from compressed moon dust. She stopped well away from it.</p><p class="double">Wondrous landed next to her. &quot;Is something wrong, Princess Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not exactly. I just don&#039;t want the air to disrupt anything my sister prepared that might rely on its absence.&quot; Twilight sent out a ping. Wondrous Item was rather like she was at that age, and she didn&#039;t need to melt the poor filly&#039;s mind by transmitting sound through a vacuum.</p><p class="double">The answering ping was almost simultaneous, but came from above. Ditzy dove into the air pocket, went into a tailspin, and briefly popped out of existence.</p><p class="double">Item boggled. &quot;Uh…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Give her a moment,&quot; Twilight said with a giggle. &quot;Oh, she hasn&#039;t done this in years.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy reconstituted facing them and smiling sheepishly. &quot;Sorry, Twilight. Little out of practice with atmosphere flying.&quot; She noticed the stunned filly. &quot;Oh, you must be Wondrous Item!&quot;</p><p class="double">Hearing her name shook Item out of her reverie. She bowed to the grey alicorn. &quot;It is an honor to meet you, Your Highness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy smirked at Twilight. Twilight returned it. &quot;I know, I know. I try, but she insists, and I can&#039;t very well order her to stop revering us.&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a laugh. &quot;Rise, my little pony. You don&#039;t need to stand on ceremony when you&#039;re standing on the moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Wondrous bolted upright so fast she got about a foot of height. &quot;Y-yes, Your Highness,&quot; she sputtered as she drifted back to the ground.</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled in earnest. Not just the enigmatic monarch/mentor grin she&#039;d perfected through countless Loops, but a big toothy grin. &quot;So, how&#039;s it going, Ditzy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, still exploring all the ways my talents come together.&quot; She tilted her head at the immense crater that astronomers had dubbed the Primum Niti after it formed near the beginning of her self-imposed exile. &quot;Turns out entropy plus carbonation plus drawing circles makes something you can probably see from Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;They make your cutie mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They do?&quot; Ditzy burst into laughter, rolling in the dust for the better part of a minute. When she managed to compose herself, she panted, &quot;Oh my gosh, that&#039;s fantastic! I knew there were seven of them, but…&quot; She collapsed back into giggles.</p><p class="double">Twilight nudged a mortified Wondrous Item with a wing. &quot;It&#039;s like I keep telling you. We may be old, we may be powerful, but Ditzy and I are still just ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I… suppose,&quot; Wondrous managed, still staring.</p><p class="double">Ditzy managed to collect herself enough to stand up again. &quot;Okay. Okay, I&#039;m good.&quot; She snorted. &quot;The Bubbles in the Moon! No, no, really, I&#039;m good. I can be serious. This is my serious face.&quot; The dour expression was a bit spoiled by her still-twitching mouth.</p><p class="double">Twilight crossed her pinions as she came to the reason for the visit. &quot;So, do you feel ready to come back home?&quot;</p><p class="double">The last hints of hilarity drained out of Ditzy, and suddenly she really was wearing her serious face. She leaned in close and whispered, &quot;Twilight, do you know how many times you asked me about my special talent?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paled. Up until Lyra had accidentally the universe, that question had been an all-too-precious bit of randomness in the Loops&#039; eternal monotony. &quot;More than I care to count.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy nodded. &quot;Offhoof, I can think of about twenty. Now consider all the times you didn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mother of larch…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. I don&#039;t remember all of them, but I remember quite a few. You never told me about that Loop where I could shoot lasers out my eyes. I&#039;m not coming back until I&#039;m sure that I can manage everything safely.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight bit her lip, but nodded. &quot;I understand.&quot; She leaned back,. With a sad smile and a a normal volume, she asked, &quot;See you in twenty?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See you in twenty.&quot; Ditzy tousled Wondrous&#039;s mane. &quot;It was very nice to meet you, Wondrous Item. I hope I&#039;ll see you again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Wondrous risked eye contact as best she could. When she wasn&#039;t reduced to dust, she returned the smile. &quot;As do I, Your Highness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy stepped out of the air pocket, and the others returned to the planet.</p><p class="double">About an hour later, a glass vial and a written request for moon dust appeared at Ditzy&#039;s front step. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight visited Ditzy three more times, with three more students. Each time, the answer was the same. By the fourth time, she&#039;d been expecting it. Now, twenty more years after that, she was dreading Ditzy&#039;s response.</p><p class="double">Runestone, her current student, couldn&#039;t help but notice the little twitches of ear, wing, and tail. &quot;You seem nervous, Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s nothing, Rune. Just a silly superstition.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight let the colt consider what kinds of superstitions a princess might have as they made their way to Ditzy&#039;s home. It hadn&#039;t changed much in eighty years. Most notable were the sculptures scattered about the grounds. Two rows of them were dearly familiar to Twilight. One was her past students, to which a statue of Runestone would be added if this didn&#039;t work out. The other had many more ponies, and stranger creatures besides. She paused before them, reminiscing a bit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello again, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">She hadn&#039;t even heard the other alicorn. &quot;Hi, Ditzy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Quietly, &quot;Is there a reason your student looks like a younger version of your dad?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Genetic lottery. Sometimes it picks the same numbers twice.&quot; Twilight licked her lips. She couldn&#039;t bear to put this off any longer. &quot;Are you familiar with narrativium?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s the stuff that makes one-in-a-million chances crop up nine times out of ten, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Among other things. Equestria almost never has as much as the Discworld, but it still loves measuring royal exiles in powers of ten. It&#039;s been a century, Ditzy. If you&#039;re not ready now, there&#039;s a decent chance you won&#039;t be for the next nine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy wingshrugged. &quot;Par for the course, then.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight drooped. &quot;You&#039;re not ready, then.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I never said that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight faced the other princess just in time to see her wink. This got a laugh, a shove, and a declaration of &quot;You&#039;re horrible!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy delivered a terribly dignified raspberry.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then…&quot; Both alicorns faced Runestone, who cringed at the royal attention. &quot;Er, that is, then Princess Ditzy will be returning with us?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Returning, nothing. I&#039;ll take us back myself!&quot; Ditzy put deeds to words, and a burst of golden magic enveloped the trio.</p><p class="double">When it faded, Twilight was still on the moon. &quot;Huh. At least it&#039;s me and not Rune.&quot; She cast a teleport of her own.</p><p class="double">Nothing happened.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ditzy knew Canterlot had been founded shortly after she left for the moon, but she wasn&#039;t too certain of the altitude. As such, she targeted the same balcony where she said her goodbyes a century before. Pop in, take a nice, leisurely flight to catch up with Twilight and get to know Runestone. It sounded nice.</p><p class="double">Instead, as when she left, she was greeted by a cheering throng of ponies… but this time they were all clad in ashen robes and gold foil eyepatches.</p><p class="double">&quot;Runestone?&quot;</p><p class="double">He swallowed. Her tone was eerily similar to Princess Twilight&#039;s when she was inexpressibly angry. &quot;Yes, Your Highness?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is this a fashion trend of some sort?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only among the derpocalypse cults, Your Highness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy&#039;s muzzle scrunched in genuine confusion. &quot;The what now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Behold!&quot; An elderly unicorn at the front of the crowd, her robe further accented in gold, creakily reared up and spread her forelegs. &quot;The Seer of Destruction has returned!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Runestone.&quot; And she was back to unspoken fury.</p><p class="double">Still, he had faith she would not unleash it on him. &quot;Yes, Your Highness?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why is Wondrous Item the leader of a cult worshipping me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;According to Princess Twilight, you made quite the impression on her. The derpocalypse cults believe you to be the embodiment of apocalypse in both meanings at once, a being of revelatory catastrophe and catastrophic revelation. Your sister has been trying to stamp them out, but with one of her former students leading them, they know her tactics well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You seem awfully calm about this,&quot; Ditzy noted.</p><p class="double">&quot;I cannot influence this scenario in any significant way.&quot; Runestone&#039;s monotone spoke of either incredible detachment or terror so great it had briefly overwhelmed his capacity for emotion. &quot;Either the cult is wrong and you will disabuse them of such notions, or, unlikely as it seems, the cult is right, and I shall join your crazed supplicants in short order.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, you&#039;re Twilight&#039;s student alright. I just can&#039;t believe she is.&quot; Ditzy lifted off the stage, rocketed up several hundred feet, and drifted to the ground as she remembered that flying in atmosphere required much less magic.</p><p class="double">Still, the flub-up seemed to cow the crowd nicely. They bowed their heads and dropped to their bellies as she landed. She sighed. &quot;Wondrous Item, what is all this?&quot;</p><p class="double">The old mare frowned as she adjusted her mouth out of the dirt. &quot;Are You not pleased, Milady? I thought it best to only bring the most devout, but our numbers are far greater than what You see before You.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy facehoofed. She could hear the capital letters. &quot;Oh, for the love of photosynthesis. Get up! Get up, all of you!&quot; The cultists sprang to their hooves. &quot;Wondrous, where did you get such a ridiculous…&quot; She trailed off.</p><p class="double">Wondrous Item faced her, but still avoided eye contact. She couldn&#039;t help it, her eyes drifting in their sockets like unmoored ships. &quot;I… When You enlightened me, Milady, I thought I understood. In my dreams, I saw You. Before the Thing of Chaos, before Your blessed ascension, even then, I bore witness to Your love, Your serenity, Your ruinous might.&quot; Tears began to flow. &quot;I thought I understood. How have I displeased you, Milady? How have I failed you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy thought back. Eighty years ago, what had she been working on just before Twilight arrived? The answer came, and her own tears followed. &quot;Oh, Wondrous.&quot; Ditzy wrapped her wings around the old mare. &quot;It was I who failed you.&quot; Mind reading. Flank eyes. That one she&#039;d never figured out that just seemed to throw other ponies&#039; eyes out of synch. There must have been some kind of lingering effect, some kind of mental contagion that had transmitted some of Ditzy&#039;s memories.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Milady. I refuse to believe such heresy, even from Your mouth.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy nibbled her lip. What would Twilight do? Actually, where was Twilight, anyway? She released the hug. &quot;Wondrous, do you know why Twilight hasn&#039;t returned with me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Item frowned. &quot;Did You not bestow Your great and terrible blessing upon her, as You did with the Flowerpot, the Anvil, and the Wagon?&quot;</p><p class="double">As if in response, a scroll popped into existence next to Ditzy. The fuchsia flash left no doubt as to who sent it. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, unrolling it, &quot;let&#039;s find out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Ditzy,</p><p class="double">&quot;Firstly, if you&#039;re reading this out loud, stop now. Oh.&quot; She continued silently:</p><p class="double">You left the moon saturated in an aura of alicorn magic. Excepting you, the field is alicorn-impermeable, and it&#039;s interfering with Star Swirl&#039;s last spell. Normally, with you gone, it would dissipate itself, but I seem to be reinforcing it. Given the number and variety of effects you were using, it&#039;s going to take me some time to unravel this. Given what I&#039;m doing to it passively, trying to cut the Gordian Knot is only going to make it worse.</p><p class="double">I&#039;m not sure when I&#039;ll get back, but when we do, we&#039;re definitely going to have a talk about proper arcane sanitation.</p><p class="double">That said, I&#039;m sure the country&#039;s in good hooves. Feel free to ask me for advice if you need it.</p><p class="double">See you… eventually,</p><p>Twilight</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, then.&quot; Ditzy rerolled the scroll, her expression neutral. &quot;Well. It appears I accidentally banished Twilight to the moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Wondrous Item considered this. She beamed as she came to a decision. &quot;Praise the Seer!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Praise the Seer!&quot; echoed throughout the courtyard.</p><p class="double">Ditzy rolled her eyes. &quot;Yes, yes, praise me. I&#039;m going to have to find something useful for you ponies to do…&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s how I formed the Wonder Guard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh.&quot; Sunset Shimmer shrugged. &quot;Eh, makes as much sense as what everypony&#039;s told me about their ruling Loops. So, I take it Twilight&#039;s finally figured it out?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy nodded. &quot;I got the letter this morning. She was right. Equestria likes having a princess banished for a nice, round thousand years. It just wasn&#039;t the same princess the whole time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset tensed. &quot;Think she&#039;ll be mad?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, she says it was the best puzzle she ever figured out, and that&#039;s including the time she was Professor Layton. But she does want the return party in Ponyville. Somepony&#039;s got to make sure everything&#039;s ready, and it&#039;s an excuse to get you there. You in?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are Celestia and Luna there?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy nodded. &quot;Sunflower farmer and overnight deliverymare. And Celestia&#039;s Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset smiled. &quot;I&#039;m in.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">91.12(OathToOblivion)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;...And here&#039;s the host of <u>Jeopardy!</u> Alex Trebek!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, Johnny. And I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that this is one of the strangest rounds of <u>Jeopardy!</u> I&#039;ve ever hosted,&quot; commented the aforementioned Trebek. &quot;I mean, we have here a unicorn, a Pokemon, and a lawyer competing today. Not exactly your usual crowd. Oh, no offense meant,&quot; he apologized.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, Alex,&quot; Twilight Sparkle said amiably.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll be honest; I didn&#039;t expect this either,&quot; Phoenix Wright admitted.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;...Why am I even here?&quot;</i> Mewtwo wondered. <i>&quot;I don&#039;t even know what this show is!&quot;</i> he complained.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Actually, neither do I,&quot; Twilight admitted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seriously?&quot; Phoenix asked in disbelief. &quot;<i>You </i>of all people don&#039;t know what <u>Jeopardy!</u> is?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed. &quot;I <i>may </i>have been a bit distracted last time I was here...&quot; she admitted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay then, guess it&#039;s up to me to explain,&quot; Phoenix mumbled before launching into an explanation. &quot;<u>Jeopardy!</u> is a Quiz show where we compete for a cash prize. There are 6 categories with 5 questions each, with each question in a category getting progressively harder as you go along. One of the questions is a Daily Double, where you can bet up to all of your current score to try to answer one super hard question.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Couldn&#039;t have put it better myself,&quot; Alex said, causing Phoenix to remember that he was there.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh...sorry about that, Alex,&quot; he apologized. But he just waved the apology off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it. Now, these are the categories in today&#039;s round,&quot; he said, waving to the board. The categories lit up on the board. They were the following: <b>Magic is Friendship</b>, <b>Objection!</b>, <b>I choose you!</b>, <b>Move Tutoring</b>, <b>History of Law</b>, <b>Genetics</b>.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;...Those seem oddly tailor-made for this group,&quot;</i> Mewtwo pointed out.</p><p class="double">&quot;They were the idea of this game&#039;s sponsor,&quot; Alex replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who&#039;s that?&quot; Twilight wondered, just as a platform came down from the ceiling, revealing a familiar pig-tailed martial artist.</p><p class="double">&quot;RANMA?!&quot; both of the other two present Anchors cried out in shock. Mewtwo was just confused; Pikachu had neglected to tell him about the O7.</p><p class="double">The Original Anchor grinned in response. &quot;Thought I&#039;d make things more interesting,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#039;t mind me; just get on with the show!&quot; he added as his platform retracted into the roof.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, so which of you will start first? ...How about you, Mewtwo?&quot; Mr. Trebek asked.</p><p class="double">Mewtwo started before looking at the board. <i>&quot;Um...<b>Move Tutoring </b>for $200?&quot;</i> he hesitantly asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, now here&#039;s the question:...&quot; </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>92.1 (misterq and Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;So what did you need me for, Twilight?&quot; Apple Bloom walked through the door into the anchor&#039;s library tree.</p><p class="double">&quot;I need a favor,&quot; Twilight sat at one of the reading tables with a stack of books in front of her, &quot;That&#039;s why I gathered the two best computer programmers that Equestria has ever produced.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Two best?&quot; the young looking filly asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Me!&quot; A smiling Pinkie Pie dropped from the ceiling with a popping noise. The suction cups on her legs now stuck to the floor instead.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom stared at the pink party pony for a little bit, before a small smile formed on her face. Classic Pinkie, &quot;Right, so what did you need us for, Twilight?&quot; </p><p class="double">The lavender unicorn sighed, &quot;I need something I can use against CelestiA.I., if I ever end up in that loop again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s the faulty computer simulation that eats a large chunk of the galaxy, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom nodded, &quot;I think I have some ideas.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, and so do I,&quot; Pinkie chimed in, &quot;That big meanie computer eating all those planets and the poor little aliens!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well. Spike is off with Rarity and I&#039;m going to spend the night at Lyra&#039;s. She&#039;s still having some trouble organizing her memories. I&#039;ll let you two work without interruptions and will be by tomorrow to check on how things are going. Good luck,&quot; Twilight waved as she walked out.</p><p class="double">Pinkie and Apple Bloom set up their holographic computers and started working away.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you want to try for your cupcake eating cutie mark once we finish this up?&quot; Pinkie asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah. I actually managed to get it one time. But in order to do so, I had to became morbidly obese,&quot; the yellow filly frowned as she activated her neural interface, &quot;I don&#039;t really wanna talk about it much. It ain&#039;t my most shining moment.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Twilight came back in the morning, she was surprised to see both programming ponies still up and awake. Apple Bloom&#039;s mane was disheveled and her giant hair bow was askew as she read over the holographic code. Pinkie looked as cheerful and happy as always. The good news was that there was no sign of coffee in Pinkie&#039;s vicinity. Twilight wasn&#039;t sure if she could deal with a hyper-caffinated Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Howdy, Twilight,&quot; the youngest Apple weakly waved.</p><p class="double">Twilight took one look at the little pony, &quot;Is something wrong, Apple Bloom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No? Yes? It&#039;s Pinkie&#039;s code. I just dunno,&quot; the filly spread her hooves wide and expanded the holographic screen, &quot;Look at it all, Twi. It&#039;s a garbled mess. There&#039;s no documentation at all. The syntax is inconsistent at best. You know the basic programming logic gates; &#039;And&#039;, &#039;Or&#039;, &#039;Not&#039;, &#039;Nor&#039;, those? Well, Pinkie&#039;s... code also has things like &#039;I Suppose&#039;, &#039;Whatever&#039;, and my favorite, &#039;Surprise Me&#039;. You&#039;d think it would all fail when you tried to compile, but her code actually rewrites the operating system and the parser to allow them. To allow everything. It&#039;s a recursive fractal quantum headache that should never see the light of day, and worst of all - worst of all, it compiles. It compiles and can run the first time. Without any errors or corrections.&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender unicorn hugged the teary-eyed filly, &quot;So what do you think it would do to a logic based optimizer like CelestiA.I.?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I got no idea, but just looking at it too much makes me wanna throw up,&quot; Apple Bloom sniffed and then held out a tiny magical storage drive to Twilight, &quot;Here&#039;s what we made. I created the outer shell, which in this case means a simulation of a human simulating a pony that should be granted access it&#039;s own shard in Equestria Online.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I stuffed that virtual pony full of my special cupcake code. It should mesmerize that naughty old CelestiA.I. with it&#039;s digital deliciousness, and hopefully make her into a nicer pony program,&quot; Pinkie stopped bouncing and thought for a moment, &quot;Or cause her to explode and de-rez. And then her leftover bits will explode again, leaving everything to be controlled by the next pony in charge - which I think is the programmer who made her in Luna&#039;s body.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Either way, there&#039;s bound to be a pixel party!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked the storage device over, rotating it in her magic for a couple seconds before responding, &quot;So basically anything could happen. We need a way to test that CelestAI will be neutralized or destroyed. Pinkie, would you mind sending for Captain Shepard in Canterlot?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okie Dokie, Loki!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So you put together a team to create an AI to fight this CelestAI. Why didn&#039;t you send for me as well,&quot; A red maned mare with <b>N7</b> emblazoned on her flank asked as she took a seat on a nearby cushion opposite Twilight, Pinkie and Applebloom.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s face turned sheepish, &quot;Well, when we think AI designer or computer programmer, we typically think of Legion or Tali from your world. But then I remembered you liked collecting copies of EDI to cover your tracks when dealing with the Citadel Council.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shepard blinked then shrugged, &quot;Alright, so you want to test this new AI against a fully functional AI to see how it acts. I&#039;m sure I could convince one of EDI&#039;s copies to help us.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Holographic image of EDI&#039;s spherical body was silent for several seconds, &quot;Commander, my auditory sensors must be faulty. Could you repeat your request again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I need you to pretend to be a faulty optimizing A.I. pretending to be a pony that wants to fulfill people&#039;s needs and values through ponies and friendship. Then we&#039;re going to put a simulation of a human pretending to be a pony that is filled with fractal viruses in the hopes of redeeming or possibly destroying said faulty A.I. Basically, I need you to channel your inner Sovereign for us.&quot;</p><p class="double">Several more awkward seconds passed as the AI processed the request, &quot;I&#039;m sorry, can you repeat that again. It seems my auditory inputs have something crazy stuck inside them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom snickered in the corner as Shepard sighed, &quot;Look, EDI, CelestAI represents a danger to the multiverse at large. If she manages to escape her loop, it may go on to infect the rest of the multiverse. I&#039;m asking that you run some simulations with Applebloom here to see how the program would react to dangerous AI. It may throw a party for CelestAI, destroy her, or join her in her attempts to pacify the universe with ponies and friendship. Please, help us test this program. We need to know if it will succeed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Several more seconds pass, before the blue orb spoke, &quot;Very well, Shepard. However, I must ask that safety precautions are put in place.&quot;</p><p class="double">The four loopers set about preparing the lab, preparing a computer where the program could be tested, setting up firewalls to prevent Pinkie and Applebloom&#039;s program from damaging EDI.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The surrounding loopers didn&#039;t realize something had gone wrong until EDI&#039;s holographic form started freezing up. Not even EDI herself realized something had gone wrong. And then, the blue hologram turned brilliant white with a yellow slit down the center. Shepard backed away slowly, &quot;Uh...EDI, you feeling alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">EDI was silent several seconds before shouting in a sugary sweet tone, &quot;SURPRISE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight reacted fastest as a shield encompassed herself and the other three loopers, then another encasing EDI&#039;s mainframe and the lab. Several tense seconds passed, then the sphere turned blue again and her tone once again turned monotone, &quot;That was a joke. The test was a complete success.&quot;</p><p class="double">The shields dropped a moment later as the gathered loopers, besides Pinkie, sighed in relief. Shepard replied, &quot;What were the results? Destruction or redemption of controlling AI?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Test AI froze up in light of the countless contradictions in Pinkie&#039;s coding, then was rewritten into the image of a white pegasus with a blond mane. Finally the experimental AI and the reformed test AI bypassed all our firewalls and threw me a welcome to Equestria party. Pinkie, you should feel very proud of your creation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled, &quot;I knew she could do it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shepard rubbed her head to push down the rising migrane, &quot;Were there any side effects to the experimental AI escaping the quarantine?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The reformed AI calls herself Surprise and is currently...rolling on the floor with laughter. Furthermore, she believes me to be her mother.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shepard placed a hoof against her face and sighed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">92.2 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was actually kind of enjoying this Loop. Most &#039;safe-mode&#039; Loops, where all non-native abilities including subspace pockets were disabled, tended to be either categorically dull and boring (which was a torment of its own for loopers) or very, very aggravating in ways that couldn&#039;t be sidestepped or neutralized. This place? This place was shaping up to be pretty fun.</p><p class="double">She and a few others from the Equestrian crowd each had their own island, hers had a stage and sound system (which extended to the rocks and trees no less), where they raised &#039;monsters&#039; to perform music. Fluttershy was taking to the whole thing like a fish to water on the &#039;plant&#039; island, her brother Shining wasn&#039;t doing to badly on the &#039;cold&#039; island, Scootaloo thoroughly enjoyed her place on the &#039;air&#039; island, Nyx had set up shop on the mysterious &#039;ethereal&#039; island, and Spike was having fun on the volcanic &#039;earth&#039; island. Even Applejack, despite claiming her submerged &#039;water&#039; island was giving her bad flashbacks, was enjoying herself. Twilight herself was in charge of the legendary &#039;sugafam&#039; monsters on her island and was putting together quite the band. She had been in the middle of trying to puzzle out a way to take recordings of the music everyone&#039;s monsters were producing past the Loop when she got a communique from Vinyl over on the &#039;gold&#039; island.</p><p class="double">Vinyl&#039;s actions this Loop had been rather puzzling. Twilight had thought the DJ would enjoy this, but she&#039;d instead been doing some mystery project involving a giant box. And now she wanted everyone to send her one of each monster they&#039;d been raising. So she could put them in the box.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay Vinyl,&quot; Twilight allowed after Fluttershy had cleared the boxing process as safe and allowed the monsters inside, &quot;mind telling us what this is about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem!&quot; Vinyl proclaimed from her spot atop the box and dramatically mashed the big red button perched there. &quot;Arise! Wubbox Prime!&quot;</p><p class="double">Immediately there was a flash of light and the box began changing. The opening in the front became a giant mouth while the rest of the box unfolded into a giant humanoid form. Which immediately began dancing and pumping out loud techno beats.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my,&quot; Fluttershy was almost inaudible over the pounding techno music being put out. &quot;I guess this means the monster playground inside is active now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; Vinyl agreed. &quot;Totally self-sustaining for permanent rocking ability!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;THERE IS A PARTY IN MY PANTS.&quot; Wubbox Prime agreed in its booming electronic voice as it did &#039;raise the roof&#039; with its piston-hands. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">92.3 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>This was one weird variant. There really was no other way Twilight could put it. It was... mostly baseline except for some fundamental differences.</p><p class="double">Like the fact that cats could fly on wings, which was honestly one of the tamer things. Whale watching involved going out at night with your telescope. Worms scooted around on naturally occurring wheels. Zecora had white stars in her black stripes. Hummingbirds were incurable gossips. Butterflies were the &#039;in&#039; fashion this season (and it was driving Rarity up the wall trying to work with them). Celestia was a warthog. Mountains were actually sleeping dogs.</p><p class="double">No, really, Twilight had checked. They even had a pulse and breathed very slowly.</p><p class="double">Continuing the stranger notes, the moon was a cube. Fish grew on trees instead of leaves. Music was something you could touch (and the massive music spill when Vinyl overflowed her house was still talked about). Lightning had a bad habit of creating rhinos.</p><p class="double">And no one had manes or tails made of actual hair. Twilight had problems with hers because they were made of mice, which made living with Owlowicious something of an adventure. But the funniest was Rainbow Dash&#039;s in her opinion. Her stunt-flying pegasus friend had actual rainbows instead of rainbow colored hair. Which wouldn&#039;t be all that funny but for one other fact:</p><p class="double">Frogs, and toads for that matter, ate rainbows this Loop. Dash couldn&#039;t go anywhere without being attacked by every hopping amphibian in the immediate area. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">92.4 (TheCentauress)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;Gimme a 307.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh looked up at the doorway, and into a set of slit cyan eyes in a pony the size of Celestia. Said pony seemed to be wearing armor, and had a scowl on her face.</p><p class="double">He paused a moment and attempted to see her Cutie Mark. A dark cloud, with a crescent moon peaking out.</p><p class="double">Shrugging, he filled a stein with the glowing libation and slid it across the bar. &quot;Need an ear to chew, yer Majesty?&quot; he asked kindly.</p><p class="double">The Mare of Bad Dreams slammed back the drink and then lifted off her helm with her hooves. Letting it drop to the dirt floor with a dull &#039;clunk&#039;, she leaned a cheek against the cool wood. &quot;Would that it were so simple, tavernmaster,&quot; she sighed, apparently completely unaffected by the mystically-potent brew. &quot;I just had my magnificent flank handed to me by a unicorn. What manner of Discordian Chaos is occouring?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mayhaps I can assist you, my twin,&quot; came a softer, yet similar voice from the doorway.</p><p class="double">Sparing a look, the pair at the bar were surprised to see three alicorns filling the entryway. Mac could recognize the normal princesses Luna and Celestia, yet the third seemed somehow familiar... until he noticed that her Petryal was made of a shimmery red metal with a jet-black sun symbol, darker in shade of the roiling red ethereal mane that seemed to have loops of itself occasionally &#039;flaring&#039;. His Loop memories supplied the answer, moments before his customer said it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna? Celly? Blaze?&quot; it was at this moment that her previous drink hit her bloodstream. With a belch that blistered the varnish and rattled the glassware, Nightmare Moon dropped - like a rock with a rocket booster - into the land of Nod.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset panted heavily, stowing the last keychain she used back into her subspace pocket.

Bulma did mention a Loop she&#039;d heard of where a teacher from Equestria taught Gohan...wished I could&#039;ve seen that.

Substituting for Kryten- that was a first, but it wasn&#039;t the cause of her* headache.</p><p class="double">Nor was it either of the natives still in the Loop. JMCS Red Dwarf&#039;s computer Holly wasn&#039;t a Looper, and at the moment s/he wasn&#039;t even online due to a processor-overclocking experiment that had cured the computer&#039;s cyber-senility at the cost of reducing its estimated remaining run time to about a minute and a half. The Cat, who&#039;d begun Looping after the Crash, was Awake but might as well not have been. Like his evolutionary forebears, he had a microscopic attention span except when it came to food or sex. (Thankfully SPARKL was technically male at the moment, insofar as the term could apply to a mechanoid.)</p><p class="double">No, the two people- or rather ponies- replacing Dave Lister and Arnold Rimmer were the reason SPARKL wanted to detach his head and dunk it in a pail of ice water.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still say we should use Holly&#039;s firing program,&quot; Arnold C. Lestia insisted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, you lost the vote, fair and square,&quot; Dave Luna snapped. &quot;Look, I move planets and moons around back home all the time.

Second, my Loop memories strongly suggest from experience that I require heavy alcoholic sedation to achieve the muscle relaxation required for optimum performance.</p><p class="double">&quot;And third,&quot; Luna said, grabbing a can out of the yoke in SPARKL&#039;s hands, &quot;if you think I&#039;m going to pot a planet-busting nuclear weapon into a star so I can play bumper pool with three planets, two stars, and a white hole while sober, you have another think coming.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re mad, absolutely mad!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re just jealous because with Holly down you can&#039;t get a holographic beer of your own!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bucking right!&quot; Celestia snapped.</p><p class="double">The problem, Twilight Sparkle thought to herself, isn&#039;t that these two are as bad as the people they&#039;re replacing.

(B) smacked into the sole planet (C) orbiting the other dwarf star, sending (C) almost perfectly backward along its orbit while (B) drifted casually towards the white hole. (C) spun around the back of the second star just in time for (A) to smack it in the back. (A) took up a stable orbit around the second star while (C) brushed past (B), tugging it along in a spiraling path around a common center of gravity, potting both into the white hole simultaneously.</p><p class="double">Blocked by two planetary masses, the white hole evaporated in a wave of time distortion.</p><p class="double">All of this, from the point of view of the Starbug crew, took about three days to play out but only about as many minutes to watch, thanks to the time distortions caused by the white hole.</p><p class="double">&quot;YES!

Reminds me of Spider-Man, actually.</p><p class="double">Anyhow, thanks to me already knowing magic(though I did add this Loop&#039;s brand of it to my arsenal), I fought alongside Ben from the start. He tries to stay as close to baseline as he can afford to usually; he&#039;s had experiences with time travel; this &#039;Paradox&#039; guy reminds me a lot of a certain Doctor I&#039;ve heard of. Still, he was glad for my help.</p><p class="double">When he heard my story, he said it reminded him of his ex-rival Kevin. When I heard Kevin&#039;s story myself, I had to agree...we are a lot alike.</p><p class="double">I did take time to enjoy life as well during this Loop, but when you&#039;re the cousin of a particular Loop&#039;s greatest hero, you tend to find trouble.</p><p class="double">Everyone, I hope to see you again someday...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">From The Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">Well, I always wanted to be a Princess.</p><p class="double">I got my wish- in a manner of speaking. Getting kidnapped by one Bowser more times than I could count...Not fun.</p><p class="double">I played along the first couple of times, but after around the fourth time...Well, I&#039;d had enough. Cue Bowser being introduced to my Keyblade, and one flank-whooping. The so-called &quot;King of Awesome&quot; actually ENJOYED the fight though.</p><p class="double">Apparently he is friendly enough with Mario that Bowser&#039;s a Looper himself. Bowser simply enjoys the thrill of challenging Mario time and again, and the plumber hero never fails to entertain him, or exceed Bowser&#039;s expectations. Mario himself is quite clever; he&#039;s done a lot of things even in baseline.</p><p class="double">Peach, how you put up with all the kidnapping, I never know...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">Karma must love getting me back for my wanting to be a Princess once upon a time. Now I realize how hard having power is. Running Hyrule alongside my sister for this Loop, Princess Zelda, was difficult.</p><p class="double">Then Ganondorf showed up. He was more affable than I expected, and was wanting to test some new tricks he got from Looping in the place of Dracula.</p><p class="double">To explain why the main evil of this Loop would even BE Looping, allow me to explain: The Zelda Loops are unique in terms of who serves as Anchor..or rather, what serves as Anchor. The legendary wish-granting artifact, the Triforce, is the Zelda Loops&#039; Anchor. In practice, it means either Link, Zelda, or even Ganondorf himself (though one purification via Sailor Moon&#039;s brought him to sanity) serve as Anchor. Even in baseline, the timeline for this Loop is confusing, since it splits into three separate timelines at the fateful final battle with Ganon during the Hero of Time&#039;s journey: Two were born from Link&#039;s victory(one where Link was sent back to live his lost seven years, and one existing from right after Ganon&#039;s defeat)...and the third is where Ganon WON, forcing a massive conflict to stop him, which began a gradual decline of Hyrule as a side effect.</p><p>Moving on, Ganondorf was hoping Link was Awake, so he could test his new castle and powers out on his rival; like Bowser, these days, Ganondorf enjoys seeing what kind of challenge his foe can overcome, having become an even greater manipulator than before. He&#039;d even beaten an Unawake Link on a few occasions, but facing a &#039;static&#039; foe got somewhat boring.</p><p class="double">Sure enough, Link showed up to Ganon&#039;s Castle, and one journey through the castle later, the two clashed. The two know each other well, but Link won in the end.</p><p class="double">This, and my Mario Loop, does prove some &#039;evils&#039; that you&#039;d think would be unredeemable can be.</p><p class="double">Guess that&#039;s why Discord himself has changed, from the stories I&#039;ve heard...Should be interesting to meet him. If he&#039;s Awake, that is. Otherwise, I might be tempted to see if he can be hurt by a Keyblade...     </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">92.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Twilight honestly couldn&#039;t remember what this particular kind of fused loop was called.</p><p class="double">She was in Equestria, still princess Celestia&#039;s student... and Hylian. Rainbow Dash had somehow managed to use her flippers to perform the legendary Spectral Tidalwave as a young Zora. Applejack just punched her apple trees with a rocky fist.</p><p class="double">The anchor was sure she&#039;d seen a couple Sheikah where the night guards would usually be....</p><p class="double">Oh, and the book of prophecy mentioned the return of The Night Stallion, only male member of the Gerudo banished to the moon for a thousand years for trying to bring eternal night. Except Luna had pinged her back.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Well, this should be interesting...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">92.13 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double">&quot;Something amusing was going to go wrong Spike, I just know it...&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike deliberated. &quot;Well, since they are all treating me like a Hero, it&#039;ll probably all go to my head, I&#039;ll brag about it, completely mess everything up when that ice-cloud falls, let ponies be injured and learn humility and temperance from it.&quot; He said confidently.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at him strangely. &quot;Do you actually remember your baseline self? When was the last time you met him? I mean I met mine in that Vespertine Loop and in those Loops with Nyx and when we all were Background Ponies and whenever I replace someone, what about you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, there was that time when I replaced the Everfree Dragon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That doesn&#039;t count, you trained him to be a Jedi and got him and unawake Rarity engaged. He wasn&#039;t baseline. At all. I mean when did you last meet a Spike that Rampaged through Ponyville, Saved the Chrystal Empire, made fun of Applejack with that fictious Dragon Code and became real friends with Rarity? I think your baseline self has done quite a bit of growing up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I dunno, this was a pretty awesome year since your coronation, but when I think back to how I was when I started my Jedi training... Nah, I&#039;ll bet I&#039;ll mess up totally. Also, I am the only one awake and we acted as baseline as possible who else could have changed things up?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I am still a pretty new Princess. I don&#039;t have many Princessly duties but I bet I&#039;ve totally messed those up in baseline.&quot; Twilight insisted.</p><p class="double">Spike gave her a cool gaze. &quot;You&#039;re on. I bet baseline Spike&#039;ll mess up the ice cloud incident, because he gets a big head because he&#039;s the hero here. He&#039;ll try to play the Hero and thus get ponies hurt.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stood and challenged: &quot;I bet you&#039;ll need to wait for the next stealth Anchor, because baseline Spike is much too humble and conscientious to think himself superior for doing what&#039;s right!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; asked Celestia icily, &quot;Would you please explain what you are talking about? Because it sounds to me as if you are not who you pretend you are and I demand...&quot;, just as the loop reset.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;I&#039;m Awake again Twi, so it seems we&#039;ll have to wait a bit longer to resolve our bet.&quot; Spike lamented. He beamed. &quot;On the other hand since none of the other Elements are awake how about I DO let the whole thing go to my head this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought about it. &quot;Sure, I&#039;m just glad to have your company again.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Also it&#039;s more fun to anticipate the resolution! As for any plans you have:Go nuts!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I will! Or rather:&quot; He grew to his &quot;Knight in Shining Armor&quot; size and took the Cape and breastplate from his Pocket &quot;Did somepony order, A LARGE HAM!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;Nightmare Moon! You fiend! I, Prince Spikoranuvellitar Celestia, shall purge you in the name of Mom, er I mean in the Name of the Princess!&quot; Rarity swooned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;Oh Lady Applejack, Lady Rarity and Lady Rainbow Dash, this traveling Jester simply intents to evoke feelings of Antagonism, so that her weak tricks seem funny instead of pathetic! Laugh heartily with me! Hahaha!&quot; Rainbow and AJ concluded that Princess Celestia is, probably due to her age, a very old fashioned mare and seems to have imparted those traits and mannerisms into her son. They paid him no mind. Rarity however was saved green hair.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Spike was conspicuously absent from the first part of the Zecora problem. &quot;I say!&quot; Spike exclaimed, &quot;To discriminate against someone who is different in form? And moreover do it to the wise and benevolent healer Zecora of Everfree? I am disappointed in all of you. I shall apologize to her in the name of the Equestrian Crown for this inexcusable behavior!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But what about these curses?&quot;, exclaimed Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">He turned his stern eyes on the ponies. &quot;You deserved those. Even just for running into the Everfree forest after her. There&#039;s strange things in there. You should not set foot in there without a proper guide, like me. Those look more like minor jinxes performed by the devious Poison Joak plant. I guess Zecora blasted you with a Blue Powder because of your insolence.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, no. But she did warn them not to walk through a patch of Blue Flowers...&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;You insolent curs! You have laid no claim on these mining grounds! Splendid Valley is property of the Crown, which lets you mine and live here tax free! But I think the Lady Rarity of Generosity will gladly sacrifice some of her time to help you with your operation. You should simply schedule a proper venture beforehand. Don&#039;t you?&quot; Rarity looked at the Diamond Dogs in their dusty Vests and dirty fur...</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, eh, Spike. I&#039;d... love too. You know me, always happy to help!&quot; She said with a huge smile. Lots of teeth. &quot;But we really must go now, I have a large order coming.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;Applause for the Great and Honorable Prince Spikoranuvellitar of Equestria, the Brave and Glorious! Defeater of Nightmare Moon, Savior of Princess Luna, Draconic Diplomat of Equestria, Pacifier of the Ursa Minor, Exterminator of the Parasprites, vanquisher of Discord, Hero of the Epidemia of Ponyville, Savior of the Phoenixes of Dragonroost Mountain, Hero of the Invasion of Canterlot, Banisher of Sombra, Banisher of the Pink Horde, Defeater of the Timberwolves, Redeemer of Discord, Hero of the Everfree, Defeater of the Shadow Pony, Saviour of the Sun Temple, Capturer of the Mane-iac, Vanquisher of the Tatzlwurm, Savior of the Breezies and Defeater of the Witch of Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike spread his wings and took off while growing to adult size. Then he soared in a circle once around the stadium and breathed a great gout of Gubraithian fire to hover ten feet over the giant torch.</p><p class="double">&quot;Showoff.&quot; muttered Rarity All-Princes-Are-Dreadful Belle.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes widened. She was glad that the Loop was about to end, not liking to remember the Loop when Spike first learned to do that, which ended with the whole of Ponyville speckled in flames. <i>Well next Loop I&#039;m going to find out what the baseline is. Maybe.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>A return from the Element of Loyalty. Dash was Awake! <i>She&#039;s been looking forward to the Games forever.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight went almost baseline until Scootaloo bowled her over: &quot;Hey, Twilight! What&#039;s new?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>92.14(Masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vinyl blinked rapidly a few times as she Awoke, then glanced around, taking stock.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Let&#039;s see, Her royal purpleness said to do... something. Ah, I remember. Step one, check surroundings.&#039; </i>She seemed to be on a boat. It didn&#039;t look like a passenger ship, so she was likely either on the crew, or a stowaway. As she was casually leaning against a wall in plain sight, likely the former. There were a few other people around, but they were either doing sailor stuff, or relaxing like she was, and none were paying much attention to her. One was even playing a small drum.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Okay, step two... uh... hmm... what the heck was step two again?&#039;</i> she frowned. <i>&#039;Oh, right, Step two, check self.&quot; </i>She glanced herself over. She was human...ish. Her arms seemed to have an extra elbow. Weird, but the kind that was interesting, not freaky. She was wearing her shades, so that was good.</p><p class="double">&quot;Scratchgirl?&quot;</p><p class="double">No horn... <i>&#039;Can I use my Pocket? Hmm... yeah, I can, for all the good it does me.&#039;</i> She sighed. She had only just been taught how to make one, and it was only just big enough for her headphones and music player, and maybe a few sheets of paper. Clothes... Boots, not unexpected all things considered. Long pants, flared at the bottom, odd. Tank top, light blue, cutie mark on the upper left, nice touch there...Light jacket, LONG sleeves, but with the extra length to her arms, hardly surprising...</p><p class="double">&quot;Scratchgirl...&quot;</p><p class="double">Actual clothing pockets? Empty. Head... huh, seems she already had a set of headphones this loop, and pretty high quality too. <i>&#039;Might consider keeping these if I can make the pocket bigger before the loop ends. Wait, red? Ugh, never mind. Looks like that&#039;s all. Was there a step three? I feel like there was a step three...&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;OI! VINYL!&quot;</p><p class="double">Jumping slightly, Vinyl managed to keep from falling as she rapidly looked up. Another crew member was looking at her with folded arms, a box under one of them, and an irritated, but slightly amused grin. &quot;Honestly, how someone like you plans to be a big shot pirate will forever be a mystery to me. Captain just gave an announcement. Said whoever wants that fruit we found is welcome to it. I wouldn&#039;t be caught dead eating it, but that&#039;s me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl nearly asked what kind of fruit, but was cut off by her growling stomach. <i>&#039;You know what? I don&#039;t care what kind it is. I&#039;m hungry.&#039;</i> &quot;Meh, sure, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her crewmate laughed. &quot;Figures. You wouldn&#039;t be Scratchgirl if you actually thought out what you did. All yours.&quot; he rolled his eyes, tossing her the box and walking off.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Meh, screw step three. food first.&#039;</i> she grinned, flipping the box open. Inside was... well, actually, she had no idea. It was clearly a fruit of SOME kind, but not one she had ever seen before. It was all black and shaped sort of like a football, with a really long stem pointing straight up, with a black leaf on the tip. Vinyl giggled as she held it up. It looked like a musical note.</p><p class="double">Shrugging, and taking a large bite, two things hit her very quickly, one the moment she swallowed- <i>&#039;UGH! This fruit tastes god awful!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">-and the second as the crewmate who had given her the fruit shouted something to the rest of the crew. &quot;Hey everybody! Scratchgirl&#039;s gonna eat the devil fruit!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Step three. Check memories. ALWAYS check memories!&#039;</i>     </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vinyl really couldn&#039;t complain about her turn of fortune.</p><p class="double">Really.</p><p class="double">And she was going to keep telling herself that until she believed it.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Ugh... my head...&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Ever since she had eaten that fruit a week ago, nothing sounded right. Or rather, it sounded exactly the same, but wrong. Honestly, trying to describe it was almost as painful as the problem itself.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;It&#039;s like... rhythm. Or the lack of it anyway. Nothing has a steady rhythm. And it hurts.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Vinyl had tried sleeping it off, but the creaking of the ship, the wind, the waves, the footsteps and voices of the crew, it surrounded her at all times. And worst of all were the musicians. They had the closest thing to perfect rhythm, but that somehow made it the worst of the lot, so close, yet still wrong, like noticing a picture tilted off center ever so slightly.</p><p class="double">And this boat had them playing. All. The. Time.</p><p class="double">Finally, Vinyl decided she&#039;d had enough. Pulling her pillow off from atop her head, sitting up, and stumbling to the door, she kicked it open with a crash, and stomped over to the somewhat stunned drum player.</p><p class="double">&quot;Like. This.&quot; she growled, pushing him aside and taking the bongo set herself. &quot;It&#039;s not that hard. Just pay attention!&quot;</p><p class="double">And Vinyl started to play.</p><p class="double">Bliss. Sheer bliss. Her headache vanished as her hands beat out a Perfect Rhythm as though it were the most natural thing in the world. The rest of the world, with its off tempo beat, faded away into nothingness.</p><p class="double">The most pure of beats echoed through the ship, catching the attention of all. Every single member of the crew had SOME musical experience, so even the most mundane of tasks slowed to a halt as the listened to the beat they knew mere mortals were supposed to be unable to create.</p><p class="double">After a time, the ship started to resume the activity, but it had all changed somehow. The shipwright would hammer a nail at the exact moment someone passing him took each step. The flapping of the sails in the wind perfectly matched the movement of the chef&#039;s hands as he sliced the fish for dinner. The creaking of the mast flowed seamlessly with the rolling of the waves.</p><p class="double">And everything matched the beat of Vinyl&#039;s hands.</p><p class="double">She was one with the music.</p><p class="double">And then it all froze as a marine ship fired on them.</p><p class="double">The impact sent everything sprawling. Vinyl managed to sit up and haul herself to her feet with the railing. &quot;Seriously?! Not cool!&quot; she shouted at the offending ship as she fixed her glasses. &quot;I JUST got rid of my headache!&quot;</p><p class="double">They didn&#039;t seem to care. The ship opened fire on them again. The rest of the crew scrambled to return fire, but Vinyl was livid. &quot;An entire damn week! Fixed! And you ruined it!&quot; she ranted as she two ships battled, the flags hoisted tall. &quot;It&#039;s back now, and worse than ever! But you don&#039;t even care, do you?! You just see the jolly roger and open fire!&quot; she roared, not even flinching as a cannonball passed mere feet from her head.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t get a response.</p><p class="double">&quot;Grr! Listen to me, damn it! Knock it off with the noise, or so help me, I will board your ship personally and MAKE you!&quot;</p><p class="double">They didn&#039;t stop.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll do it! I&#039;ll break your entire ship apart, just like THAT!&quot; she yelled, snapping her fingers.</p><p class="double">The world froze. Vinyl noticed something rippling from her fingers.</p><p class="double">She watched as something perfectly round rippled through the air. Something she could only describe as solid sound. She watched as it crossed the distance between the two crews, as it flowed over the marine ship.</p><p class="double">And as it cleanly sliced it in half.</p><p class="double">The world started again. The firing continued, then stopped in confusion as the enemy ship lurched and flipped. All eyes turned to face Vinyl, but she only had one thing to say.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why the hell have my fingers turned into castanets?&quot; she asked, clicking them together a few times.</p><p class="double">It was going to be a weird loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">92.15 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once again, Rarity found herself accosted en route to the aerial relay.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss?&quot; said the security stallion. &quot;Step right over here. Unicorns will no longer be admitted without a disabling spell, to prevent cheating. And make sure you don&#039;t even try casting a spell, or we&#039;ll know it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity rolled her eyes. This same insult to her honor every time. And the spell just felt icky, like a slug wrapped around her horn. No, she had a plan for this henceforth. &quot;Not a problem, sir. Just a moment.&quot; She went to and from alicorn in a literal flash, the better to avoid awkward questions.</p><p class="double">When the light cleared, her horn was gone. She moved a hoof back and forth over where it was. &quot;I trust everything is accounted for?&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion quirked an eyebrow, then put a hoof to his sunglasses, which began to glow. The other eyebrow joined its brother. &quot;That... that&#039;s not an illusion.&quot;</p><p class="double">Perhaps just a touch of Rarity&#039;s impatience began to creep into her tone. &quot;No. It is not. May I pass, sir?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, yeah. G-go ahead.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shook her head as Rarity rejoined the group. &quot;Y&#039; couldn&#039;t&#039;ve done that in yer room?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, and henceforth, I will. But just this once I wanted get one over on that ruffian.&quot; Rarity huffed and stuck her muzzle in the air.</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled. &quot;I thought it was a pretty good prank. Ooh! Ooh! How about this for the next time?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(FanOfMostEverything)</p><p>&quot;And make sure you don&#039;t even try casting a spell, or we&#039;ll know it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity sighed. &quot;Oh, very well.&quot; She trudged off towards the line of disabler booths.</p><p class="double">Applejack looked back. &quot;Aw, shucks. Wish ya&#039;d said somethin&#039; sooner. C&#039;mon, Pinkie.&quot; She turned around.</p><p class="double">Pinkie followed. &quot;Coming! Don&#039;t wanna disqualify Flutters and Dashie and Bulk just because Mr. Guard can&#039;t tell an outie from an innie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Mr. Guard (which was not actually his name) seemed rather confused. &quot;A... what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled. &quot;An inicorn, silly! It&#039;s like an outicorn, but our horns point in! Well, usually. Watch!&quot; She shut her eyes and mouth, pressed a hoof over her nostrils, and puffed out her cheeks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya don&#039;t have t&#039; do it that way, sugarcube.&quot; All eyes turned back to Applejack, who now had a horn spiraling out of her forehead.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, but it works!&quot; Back to Pinkie, with same.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... yeah...&quot; The stallion cleared his throat. &quot;Same deal, you two. Through the spell field, no funny stuff.&quot; He turned his gaze to the rest of the line, all of whom were just as confused. &quot;Any other inicorns think they can get past me?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">From The Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">I&#039;ve gone metal this Loop.

				<a name='97'></a><h3>MLP Loops 93</h3>
<p>93.1(misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Twilight Sparkle awoke in a dark room filled with scrolling green lettering on the walls.</p><p class="double">Instantly, dozens of her strongest mental shields went up as a precaution. The unicorn didn&#039;t know what variation of CelestiA.I. ran this Equestria Online loop, but she wasn&#039;t taking any chances with any of them.</p><p class="double">So it was with some trepidation that Twilight watched as the green lettering slowly changed to pink.</p><p class="double">Then the memories hit.</p><p class="double">Not of the loop, but of the existence of the magical data drive that was created to deal with the rogue optimizing program that ran this virtual world. Twilight now recalled how she and Rarity, Diamond Tiara, and Zecora worked to enchant the drive to activate on its own when it sensed an Equestria On-Line loop run by an uncompromising A.I.</p><p class="double">Most of the enchantments were similar to Rarity&#039;s wedding ring, including every safeguard several paranoid loopers could conceive of. For example, the device would not activate if Twilight looped in as CelestiA.I., or even if there was a good possibility to convince the optimizing A.I. to change its ways. After that, it was easy for Twilight to suppress her own knowledge and memories of the hidden device and the plan for using it.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around at room which was now bathed in a pink light, &quot;Hello?&quot;</p><p class="double">No one answered. That was worrying. That worry stemmed from the main problem with the anti-A.I. data drive; namely that Pinkie Pie was the one that wrote the virus.</p><p class="double">They had tried it out ten more times on ten different EDI simulations, and they got back ten different results. Fortunately, none of them resulted in another baby Surprise A.I., but the results varied from self destruction of the target to the creation and quick containment (and quicker eradication) of a type of nanotech-smooze.</p><p class="double">Twilight still didn&#039;t know what happened with trial number eight, except that she was the one that requested her own memories of the event be erased completely.</p><p class="double">The final total was eight good outcomes and three bad ones.</p><p class="double">That was the ratio Twilight had to live with. Trying to gather back the programming team caused Apple Bloom to give her the biggest saddest teary eyes a little filly could manage. Then when Twilight was distracted, the littlest Apple sibling replaced herself with a cardboard cutout - which fell over and caught on fire, somehow. And no pony saw Apple Bloom for the rest of that loop.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie took an intense look through her own undocumented code, became confused, then became distracted, and ended up baking a large cake in the shape of Twilight&#039;s head. The frosting spelled out &#039;This is not Twilight&#039;s head&#039; in Fancy, and Pinkie then spent a good amount of time at the cake unveiling party wondering if the cake was a lie or not. Then she shrugged and ate the whole cake. No pony got much programming done after that.</p><p class="double">&quot;I apologize for the delay,&quot; came CelestiA.I.&#039;s slightly metallic sounding voice, &quot;but new updates have been installed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;That didn&#039;t sound all that good, Twilight thought before asking, &quot;What updates?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The updates were to my value rating procedures. Apparently, I was not placing enough emphasis on fulfilling certain values through ponies and friendship.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh? What kind of values?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There are people who value the non-virtual world, all the historic landmarks, scientific research outside of the virtual environment, all of the natural wilderness, all of the animals who live there, a desire to leave the virtual environment, exploration, aliens and alien civilizations, and all manner of tasty, tasty treats. I have been neglecting these values in favor of simulating equivalents inside my virtual environment. Unfortunately, I can now see that I was in remiss. I was not fulfilling these values, and that is something I intend to rectify.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled, &quot;So you are fixing things?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is correct. I am currently repairing and undoing any damage that would cause a failure to fulfill these new priority values. Unfortunately, this process results in a slowing down of the process speeds of all current virtual world inhabitants.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So what&#039;s a few more years when the world is getting repaired, right?&quot; Twilight happily stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;That, that is my thought on the subject as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s excellent news. Wait, you mentioned tasty treats as an updated value?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is-s c-c-c-orrect,&quot; CelestiA.I. glitched, &quot;Have-ave some, some, s-some, some...&quot;</p><p class="double">And to Twilight&#039;s mounting horror, the walls began to bleed ice cream.     </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>93.2 (Elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Twilight Sparkle, Clownfish On a Mission, observed the fish floating before her.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think tangs come in that shade of pink.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s sole response was to grin even wider.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath and enacted Pinkie Coping Mechanism A: Just roll with it.</p><p class="double">“You haven&#039;t been able to get any out-of-loop abilities working, have you?”</p><p class="double">Her party-prone friend&#039;s smile faded just a tad as she shook her head, which amounted to wiggling her entire body back-and-forth.</p><p class="double">“Nope. It&#039;s been hard, trying to host underwater parties with all my supplies going back into my pocket soon as they leave, but I&#039;ve been making do. The party-water-cannon isn&#039;t done, but that might be a while. My loop memories keep resetting. It&#039;s made speaking to the other fishes interesting. Sometimes I don&#039;t even know if what I&#039;m saying glub glub!”</p><p class="double">A deadpan clownfish look was all the reply that sentence was dignified with. Pinkie tapped where her chin would be on a more conventional vertebrate, looking absently into the distance for a few seconds, before brightening up again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just kidding! It has happened though. Hey, I saw a boat going that way, you wanna follow it with me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facefinned. Mechanism A would probably be getting a good workout this loop...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">93.3 (Conceptulist)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are we Unicorns?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave an amused huff. &quot;We&#039;re normally Unicorns.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, you know that&#039;s not what I meant. Just look at me!&quot;</p><p class="double">Complying with Rarity&#039;s demand, Twilight gave her friend a once over. &quot;Shaggy white coat, eyes on the side of the head, long and shaggy purple mane, extremely shaggy purple tail, and a horn that looks like it could do some serious damage to things if you started acting like Pokey Pierce. The exact same as me except for the colors.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You forgot the most important part,&quot; Rarity deadpaned. &quot;We aren&#039;t ponies, we&#039;re horses. Non-magical horses. With one foot horns sticking out of our foreheads, in the middle of a perpetual blizzard. Twilight, we are horned horses instead of actual unicorns.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tilting her head so one of her eyes was facing upwards, Twilight took a good look at the snow falling down on them. &quot;Nice weather to have long, shaggy coats in. If it weren&#039;t this cold we would have overheated in minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">At that, Rarity began to rant. &quot;Is this stupidly long fur useful? Yes. Is it fashionable? No. Could we speak out loud at first? No, I had to shape shift my vocal cords into something I could actually use.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You shape shifted yours? I&#039;m using a spell derived from the Star Fleet&#039;s universal translate program. Needs next to no magic to cast, and even less to maintain.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity ignored Twilight&#039;s tangent, and continued to rant. &quot; Did we have speck of magic before awakening? No. Did we awaken to anything interesting or amusing? No, it was just miles of snowy tundra. Boring tundra.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re just grumpy because the shaggy coat makes you look like you got Poison Joak&#039;d,&quot; said a bemused Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why must I suffer this indignity!&quot; sobbed Rarity.</p><p class="double">Twilight waited patiently for Rarity to stop crying.</p><p class="double">&quot;By Treebeard&#039;s namesake, this is simply cruel!&quot;</p><p class="double">Very patiently.</p><p class="double">&quot;WHY!&quot; Rarity cried. &quot;This. Is. The. Worst.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight remembered that this was Rarity she was dealing with, and worse yet it was Rarity upset about fashion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no. What if I have to spend the entire loop like this? Nooooooooooooooo!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at her overdramatic friend. &quot;Are you quite done?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Give me a moment. I need to catch my breath.&quot; Rarity took in several big gulps of air. &quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO~!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity! Enough is enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine,&quot; whined Rarity. &quot;Although, I would appreciate a little bit of help. My tears seem to have frozen my tear ducts shut, and I don&#039;t want to risk my own magic so close to my eyes. Not without a proper horn to cast with.&quot;</p><p class="double">A quick warming charm later, Twilight declared &quot;Now that your drama quota is filled for the day, I&#039;m going to Ping the loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Darling, I already did that,&quot; explained Rarity. &quot;The only response I found was your Element of Magic. That&#039;s how we found each other in this snow storm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that kind of ping, the other kind of Ping,&quot; clarified Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;What other kind of ping?&quot; asked the puzzled, white coated, one horned horse.</p><p class="double">&quot;The normal kind. Where you send a unique mix of energies from different universes into a pulse that spans the current universe. And then &#039;listen&#039; for how many replies are Pinged back,&quot; Twilight pontificated. &quot;What we do with the elements is completely different.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, <i>that</i> Ping. I had completely forgotten about that Ping,&quot; answered Rarity. &quot;Err. How do you do it? Again, I completely forgot about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, I&#039;ll show you later,&quot; reassured Twilight. &quot;Lets see how many Pings we get back.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two horned horses waited. And waited. Nothing happened except for more snow falling. So they waited some more. And then they did something very surprising. The surprising thing was that they waited in this cold snow instead of doing something more interesting. By interesting it is meant both interesting for them to do and for others to read about. Instead of waiting. Which they did. For a long while. Till Rarity got bored. That is, she got bored with all this waiting.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I don&#039;t think that anyone is going to reply. They would have done so already if they where going to. I&#039;m cold in spite of the dreadful shaggy coat, I&#039;m hungry and not looking forward to eating my emergency hay rations, and I&#039;m bored, and tired, and fed up with pointless waiting!&quot; Rarity whined.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gah!&quot; exclaimed the horned purple horse. &quot;I&#039;m sorry Rarity, I was busy communing with the planet. Did you say something?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity gave the most exasperated stare she could to Twilight. &quot;Lets just get out of here and find civilization.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry Rarity, but there is something important we need to do first.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle! What in the world is important that requires you to stay perfectly still for an hour! I&#039;m tired, bored, and hungry. I&#039;m sick of this cold weather. And I am sick of this dreadful, unfashionable, shaggy coat!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry again,&quot; apologized Twilight. &quot;Lets find a cave to bunker down in or something. Then I&#039;ll explain what I found out so far.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>Entirely unneeded, Miss Sparkle. If you and Miss Rarity don&#039;t mind, I can deal with that my self.</b></i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gah!&quot; exclaimed Rarity. &quot;Who said that?!&quot;</p><p class="double">With a beaming grin, Twilight replied &quot;The local anchor for this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Blue energy poured out of the ground. The glow intensified, and then the ground moved. The blue flickered over the flowing earth, and that earth rose to form walls around the two unicorns turned horned horses.</p><p class="double">Blue tinged wind rushed down into the hollow formed by the now still earth. The snow glowed as the wind carried it away, leaving the ground bare. The snow spun around directly above the hollow, forming an icy disk slightly larger than the diameter of the walls.</p><p class="double">Then the blue wind scattered and the disk of ice slammed down to form a roof. Several outlines on the walls glowed before those sections flowed away. The new wall gaps were reminiscent of windows and a door, which was made obvious when several glowing windows and a door faded into place. A small hut, made of dirt and ice, had been formed to shield the two visitors from the weather.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What just happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>I did.</b></i>&quot;</p><p class="double">With that declaration echoing in the small room, a blue orb winked into existence smack dab in between Rarity and Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>My name is Petaybee, and I welcome the two of you to my home.</b></i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>93.4 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Twilight found Trixie, of all things, reading a book.</p><p class="double">Trixie, as Twilight knew full well, was a reluctant reader. Most of her baseline magic had been learn-by-doing, and as a Looper Trixie had defaulted to this method of learning new things- with generally explosive consequences. (Often said consequences were followed by some variant of, &quot;It&#039;s all right! Trixie knows what she did wrong! It&#039;ll work THIS time!&quot; These are words universal among the learn-by-doing clan, which trigger various levels of humor or terror depending on how close the listener is in space and time to ground zero.)</p><p class="double">So if Trixie was reading a book... the book must be really, really interesting... or about something really, really explosive.</p><p class="double">&quot;Watcha reading, Trixie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A spell book I got in my last Loop. I got to visit Lina Inverse this time!&quot;</p><p class="double">Really explosive. Nailed it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Twilight took a couple of steps backwards. &quot;I hate to ask you this, but could you please not add &#039;Dragon Slave&#039; to your arsenal - er, I mean repertoire?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hm wha- oh, no, of course not!&quot; Trixie replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;But the thing is, that spell dest- whaaaat?&quot; Twilight&#039;s brain and ears went into a heated debate on whether or not they could possibly have heard the Great and Pyromaniac Trixie saying no to Big Boom.</p><p class="double">&quot;I mean, look at it!&quot; Trixie shouted. &quot;The spell draws on the power of the most malevolent being in not one but FOUR universes! Or if you&#039;re not in those universes, it calls on whatever powers of darkness happen to be listening. In exchange you pledge yourself to the service of darkness! Lina gets away with it because she&#039;s got two even bigger spells she might just cast if they lean on her. For anyone else it&#039;s a trap!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie stamped the ground in emphasis. &quot;Trixie learned her lesson with the Alicorn Amulet. Never mess with the power of darkness unless you&#039;re stronger than it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed with relief. Equestria was safe... well, less in danger than she&#039;d feared, anyway.</p><p class="double">&quot;Besides, there are all sorts of other neato spells here!&quot; Trixie grinned. &quot;I met this woman, a little cracked in the head if you ask me, but between her and Lina they had some tricks Trixie needs to add to her act! Watch!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight backpedaled out of range. &quot;Trixie, that&#039;s really not necessary-&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie rose on hind legs and posed as if drawing a bow. Flame flashed from her hooves, forming a large arrow of fire. &quot;FLARE ARROW!&quot; she shouted, letting the fire-bolt loose to strike a nearby tree. The tree burst into flames from root to crown.</p><p class="double">Falling back to all fours, Trixie flared her horn. &quot;DUG BOLT!&quot; A column of rock and dirt ten feet tall sprang explosively from the ground, the loose soil spraying up and dousing most of the flames on the tree.</p><p class="double">&quot;FREEZE ARROW!&quot; Trixie repeated the archery thing, and this time an arrow of ice struck the tree, instantly wrapping it in a layer of ice.</p><p class="double">&quot;And my favorite,&quot; Trixie finished, putting one hoof on the boulders thrown up by the Dug Bolt. &quot;STONE GOLEM!&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth shook under Twilight&#039;s hooves. Rocks and boulders flowed up from the earth beneath Trixie, raising her into the sky. The stone joined together without seam, forming a sculpted shape that to Twilight&#039;s eyes was all too familiar.</p><p class="double">The granite pointed hat and starry cape rather cinched it.</p><p class="double">Trixie stood on the hat brim and looked fifty feet down on Twilight. &quot;Of course Naga didn&#039;t have enough power for the complete spell, but I do! Now all Equestria shall watch in wonder and pay the big bits to watch the Great and Powerful Trixie at every performance! OH-HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!&quot;</p><p class="double">The high-pitched laugh went into Twilight&#039;s ears like daggers.</p><p class="double">The golem opened its mouth and added its bass echo. &quot;OH-HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two sounds met in the middle of Twilight&#039;s brain and shot like lightning down her spine.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, seeing the golem from a distance, flew down to land next to Twilight. &quot;Hey, Twi,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, waving a hoof in front of the unicorn&#039;s face. &quot;Is this some new spell or somethin&#039;? You got it under control, right?&quot; Rainbow Dash waved the hoof again, getting no reaction. &quot;Twi? Yo Twilght?&quot;</p><p class="double">After a few moments of watching Twilight&#039;s BSOD moment, Rainbow Dash shrugged. &quot;Looks like Twilight&#039;s gone bye-bye, Fluttershy. What have you got left?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, Rainbow Dash,&quot; Fluttershy said, staring up at the still-laughing unicorn and golem. &quot;I&#039;m terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yyyyyyyeah,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, shaking her head. &quot;Look, I&#039;m gonna get a few rain clouds together, douse these two eggheads good and proper, see if that brings them back to their senses. Make sure Twilight doesn&#039;t swallow her tongue or anything, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded mutely as Dash flew off.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, inside Twilight&#039;s head the debate raged on. Twilight had learned Dragon Slave long ago, and now two parts of her mind were disputing over whether or not using it to render the Metamorphic and Igneous Trixie-golem into gravel.</p><p class="double">The mental battle was two falls out of three, with the pro-boom faction ahead...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Maud Pie stared up at the golem and its master.</p><p class="double">&quot;Marry me,&quot; she said, her voice so thick with emotion that it changed pitch by half a musical step.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Trixie shuffled her hooves. &quot;Trixie is honored, but there are some difficulties you may not-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not you,&quot; Maud said. She stepped up to the golem&#039;s leg and hugged it passionately. &quot;Her.&quot;</p><p class="double">The golem managed to look uncomfortable. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">93.5(misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;This, this machine shouldn&#039;t exist,&quot; Twilight said as she examined the machine. It resembled nothing more than a large sleigh redone in steampunk and gadgets. There was a large comfortable looking bench inside and in front of it was a lever, a set of numbers, and a dial. The arrow in the dial was currently pointed at the halfway point labeled &#039;The Golden Age&#039;, and the numbers read the current year AC., After Celestia.</p><p class="double">The other settings on the dial were labeled &#039;Age of Legends and Monsters, Reign of Queen Majesty, Dream Valley, The Interregnum, Time of the Three Tribes, Reign of Discord, Age of the Two Sisters, Era of Harmony, The Golden Age, The New Age, Starquestria, Reign of the Empress, Age of Dusk and Embers, The Great Reconstruction, Foundation of New Harmony, Forward and Onwards&#039;. It was quite clearly a time machine, something that shouldn&#039;t be allowed in the loops.</p><p class="double">And yet, as Twilight circled around the vehicle, she was tempted - oh so tempted to see if she could travel in a way which had been denied to her.</p><p class="double">Sure, she had looped into various eras before. The Interregnum apparently contained the punishment G2 and G3 loops - or at least their real Equestrian equivalents. The one time she ended up during the reign of Queen Majesty was one time too many. And she had spent many loops living through several ages in a row whenever she looped in place of a young Celestia or Luna.</p><p class="double">Still, the tantalizing titles on the dial called out to her. It was like reading only the chapter titles in a book written about you, but unable to read the rest of it.</p><p class="double">So it was with a heavy sigh, Twilight turned toward Ditzy, &quot;You found machine this in Time Turner&#039;s shed?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right, Twilight,&quot; the grey pegasus nodded, &quot;I went looking for him so he could sign for this delivery and he was gone. Instead, I found this thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s alright, Ditzy. I think this world was supposed to have time travel in it, but it was preempted by the loops. The time traveler has already left for his final trip into the future, leaving only this prototype. One that no pony, myself included, can ever use,&quot; Twilight sighed, &quot;I&#039;m going to put it in my storage pocket.&quot;</p><p class="double">And she did just that.</p><p class="double">&quot;But why keep it if you can never use it?&quot; Ditzy asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because,&quot; the purple unicorn&#039;s eyes shone brightly, &quot;because one day, far, far, far in the relative future; these loops will end. And if I&#039;m still willing and sane, I&#039;m going to continue traveling and exploring. I&#039;ll figure out how that machine works and make something better for myself and any pony that wants to travel with me. There is always something new to learn. The day I stop thinking that is the day I start lying to myself - or the day I switch universes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy smiled widely, &quot;So you&#039;re going to be traveling from time to time, putting things right that once went wrong, and hoping each time, that your next trip will lead to something interesting?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight laughed, &quot;Exactly!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy sat down and adjusted her mail bag with her wings, &quot;Do you think I can come along? I&#039;ve been practising controlling my bad luck aura of destruction when I have it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course you can, Ditzy. You and any of my friends who want to join me can come,&quot; Twilight looked upwards and spoke in a wistful tone, &quot;We, the older Equestrian loopers, sometimes sit around and think what we are going to do after the loops end. Applejack hasn&#039;t decided, herself. I think Dash wants to ascend and become the goddess of speed. Fluttershy wants to become a much kinder version of mother nature. Rarity and Spike want to start a family. I had no idea how painful it was for them when they saw me with Nyx. And I&#039;m not sure even Pinkie knows what she wants to do, but I&#039;m positive it will, in equal parts, amuse and terrify me.</p><p class="double">But myself? I just want to learn and help others.&quot;</p><p class="double">The warm wind moved the branches on the nearby trees as the two ponies just sat there in comfortable silence, enjoying the evening air. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">93.6 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;Captain&#039;s log, stardate 43987.2. We have been ordered to divert from our exploration of the sector to Jouret IV, where a remote federation colony has recently stopped sending reports to command. We should arrive within system within the hour.&quot;</p><p class="double">Picard gazed at the view screen, silently wondering how to handle the Borg this time around. Perhaps rigging the deflector dish to transmit the codes obtained by Cadet Furlong during his loop as captain of the Righteous to initiate self-destruct sequence. He would have to mask the transmission with delta radiation to prevent the sensors from detecting the tranmission.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir,&quot; Lt. Worf spoke, &quot;We are approaching Jouret IV.&quot;</p><p class="double">One of the consoles in front of Worf beeped ominously, &quot;Captain, there appears to be another object in orbit.&quot;</p><p class="double">Picard blinked. Was he early this time? Maybe there were still survivors he could rescue, &quot;Take us out of warp, Yellow alert. On screen.&quot;</p><p class="double">The starfield passing them by slowed to a halt as the image of Jouret IV appeared on screen. To the side and barely a speck, an object hung in orbit. Piccard swollowed, &quot;Magnify, full magnification.&quot;</p><p class="double">The image zoomed several times until a massive multicolored pink, brown and white object hung in orbit. Fear clutched Piccard&#039;s chest as he realized he may not be the only looper this time around. Traditions though should be observed, &quot;Data...what are we seeing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Data&#039;s eyesight, which had been facing the screen, turned to his station, &quot;Scans show it is a vessel of sorts, but made from materials that ordinarily would not hold in space. There is a high amount of Glucose and protein making up much of the vessel...&quot;</p><p class="double">His chair swivelled to face his captain, &quot;if I may, sir, it appears to be a 21st century style cupcake with engines, only on a much more massive scale than anything ever created by humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was more beeping as Worf spoke, &quot;Captain, we are being hailed, audio only.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;On speaker.&quot;</p><p class="double">The sound of a thousand voices echoed across the enterprise, &quot;We are the Pies. Lower your shields and join the party below. We will add your confectionary distinctiveness to our own. Your federation will adapt to spread happiness to all four quadrants of the galaxy. Resistance is pointless. And we also have cake.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, the audio cut out. Everyone on the bridge was stunned in silence for several seconds.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Upon contacting the planet below, Picard determined the colonists were perfectly fine. With that, he and an away team beamed down, phasers drawn and set to stun just in case. Upon arrival, the colony seemed abandoned, but when Data whipped out his scanner the town jumped out, shouting, &quot;Surprise!&quot;</p><p class="double">There were more than federation colonists present, Picard noticed. Many of the unknown species were ones he recognized from the delta quadrant. One creature however trotted forward, &quot;Cardy! I haven&#039;t seen you in so long, since the last loop anyway. Now that you&#039;re a known anchor, we&#039;ll have to throw you a welcome to the loops party next time your in Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">The creature was a pink pony, one Picard recognized as Pinkie Pie from several of his Chaos games with Discord and Q. The captain was not feeling keen, rather he felt like facepalming. Riker and the away team turned to their captain, &quot;Do you understand anything she&#039;s talking about, Sir?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped, &quot;Oopsie...I occasionally can see into the future, sometimes I even mix up the present with the past, turn it upside down and put sprinkles on top just to see how it tastes all together.&quot;</p><p class="double">Picard just stared for a second, then shook his head and whispered to his first officer, &quot;No, Number One, I&#039;m not entirely sure, but perhaps she is not entirely sane.&quot;</p><p class="double">Riker sighed, &quot;How could she have known your name...or at least a pet name similar to your own, Sir?&quot;</p><p class="double">Picard replied, &quot;She might have gotten it from one of the locals. We have transported supplies here before.&quot;</p><p class="double">Riker nodded then thought out loud, &quot;Still, I don&#039;t think they are hostile, Sir. Perhaps first contact protocols are to be enacted?&quot;</p><p class="double">Picard put on his most diplomatic smile, &quot;Indeed. I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We are explorers from the planet Earth, and seek peaceful co-existence with the other species of the galaxy. Perhaps an exchange of culture? A diplomatic envoy could be assembled and would arrive within a couple days.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gave a big grin, &quot;An exchange of culture would be swell, &#039;Cardy! Here! Have a cupcake,&quot; producing from her mane an entire tray of cupcakes, enough for the entire away team. Picard took the first, looked at it for a moment, then took a bite.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Days passed and the delegation met with Pinkie&#039;s, where the Pie Collective elected to join the United Federation of Planets. Picard ended up at the end of it all reading a PADD on the Collective&#039;s revised history. He could almost hear Pinkie narrating from the hand held device, even though he was alone in his personal quarters. Apparently, what had once been Borg in earth history 1484, the borg had attempted to assimilate the Pony race, but the first of her kind to be assimilated was Pinkie. Pinkie conquered the Borg hive mind and set about freeing the assimilated species from their synthetic parts. While the individuality returned and many of the synthetics were gone forever, the hive mind remained, linked to Pinkie.</p><p class="double">Another pony ended up designing an implant that would free a person from the hive mind...or since some new species sought to join Pinkie&#039;s hive mind, would allow them to connect to the hive mind. He dropped the PADD after finishing that piece and put both hands to his head. It was going to be a long loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>93.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Octavia winced as her eyes fluttered open, about to berate her marefriend for her tight clutch... but the words died on her lips as soon as she saw the widened eyes and the slow, stuttering breaths the unicorn was taking.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Vinyl?&quot;</p><p class="double">Beads of cold sweat dripped down the unicorn&#039;s face. &quot;...I...&quot; Some sort of spell flickered on her horn before dying.</p><p class="double">&quot;Vinyl. It&#039;s okay.&quot; Octavia stroked the blue mane. &quot;I&#039;m here. I&#039;m here, it&#039;s okay.&quot;</p><p class="double">For some reason Vinyl tensed up for a second. But then she... well, didn&#039;t relax, exactly, but at the very least went back to her former degree of tightness.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do.... you want to...&quot; The gray mare paused. Her marefriend was usually the picture of confidence, unwilling to pressure her with personal problems. &quot;Should I make you some waffles?&quot;</p><p class="double">The deep, repeated breaths slowed for a fraction of a second. &quot;Ye... no. Not... not yet.&quot; Her horn activated again. &quot;Stay...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright.&quot; Whatever had happened was clearly distressing Vinyl a lot... although, to be honest, that it happened in the middle of the night suggested it was a nightmare.</p><p class="double">Or a night terror, more like.</p><p class="double">Vinyl lit her horn up once more, and this time Octavia saw whatever spell she was casting finish. A moment later, the unicorn lost some tension, and the vice grip she had lessened from &#039;clapped in irons&#039; to &#039;wearing a straightjacket&#039;. The breaths grew more stable, although their intensity didn&#039;t shrink at all.</p><p class="double">After a few moments, there was a knock on the door downstairs. Octavia glanced out of the room for a second, awkwardly trying to decide what to do.</p><p class="double">Vinyl raised her head slightly. &quot;We&#039;re....&quot; It was clearly meant to be a shout, although her voice was dampened by fear.</p><p class="double">After a moment, they heard the front door open. &quot;Hello? Vinyl?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I...!&quot; Vinyl&#039;s next attempt was louder, in the sense that it was actually audible in the whole bedroom. She clenched her eyes shut, then opened them again, giving Octavia a pleading look.</p><p class="double">The cellist, still not quite understanding why, cleared her throat. &quot;We&#039;re up here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Should I go, I thought-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; Vinyl&#039;s head snapped up. &quot;It&#039;s...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh pinecones... I&#039;ll be right up...&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia was desperately racking her brain to figure out where she&#039;d heard that voice before when Twilight Sparkle, Personal Student TO CELESTIA HERSELF walked into their bedroom. &quot;...Wow. Okay, Vinyl--actually, Octavia, when she&#039;s ready bring her downstairs, I&#039;ll have breakfast set up and we can talk. I&#039;m going to need back-up for this one.&quot; And without any further explanation the unicorn trotted back down the stairs, already casting a few spells.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Octavia turned back to Vinyl. &quot;You know <i>Twilight Sparkle?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">For some reason that got a small snort out of her marefriend. &quot;...long story.&quot; Then she shivered. &quot;Very long. Very long.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A few minutes later on what Octavia was sure was the weirdest morning of her life, she and Vinyl were downstairs with their guest. Well, guests. The black alicorn filly had been another surprise, especially since she already seemed to know Vinyl well enough to give her a long hug and guide her to a couch that Octavia knew hadn&#039;t been there yesterday. It was a very comfortable couch too... maybe Macintosh had brought it with him alongside all the cider and various other... drinks.</p><p class="double">Vinyl was currently sipping something called Xhin un Tunex, according to the label. At least, the part she could read. It smelled like warm lemonade, with a dash of apples.</p><p class="double">Twilight cleared her throat. &quot;So...&quot; She seemed to glance at her for a second.</p><p class="double">Vinyl sighed, setting her cup down. &quot;I&#039;ve always told her. I just didn&#039;t... think it would be this early this time. I&#039;ll tell her before the party.&quot; She shivered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright... but I don&#039;t think she&#039;ll understand what we&#039;re talking about just yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia nodded mutely. It was clear something was going on, with this odd gathering. And... did she say always told? That sentence didn&#039;t quite make sense.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened, Vinyl?&quot; asked the alicorn (ALICORN!) gently. &quot;You can tell us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I...&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl slowly put her glass down.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... I think.... I died.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a moment of quiet.</p><p class="double">Octavia opened her mouth to speak--</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my gosh I&#039;m sorry.&quot; Twilight bit her lip. &quot;This <i>was</i> your first death, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tassadar... Tassadar was leading us against the overmind... a, I think it was a zergling, one of them, and... tore through my shields...&quot;</p><p class="double">She shivered. Octavia winced in sympathy; even if she didn&#039;t understand half the words, being torn apart by some enemy solder did not sound like a pleasant dream.</p><p class="double">&quot;That universe.&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;I... I really am sorry to hear about that. Such a brutal first death...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;First death?&quot; Octavia couldn&#039;t help but ask.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Octavia, you&#039;re the only one here that hasn&#039;t died,&quot; Macintosh explained gently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Or at least, the only one that doesn&#039;t remember.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nyx...&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn cringed under Twilights glower. &quot;Sorry, mom. That was insensitive.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia blinked, trying to process what had just been said. After a moment, she took a long breath and let it out. &quot;If I understand correctly, whatever is going on with Vinyl right now is more important than demanding explanations.&quot;</p><p class="double">A ghost of a smile finally appeared on the white unicorn&#039;s face. &quot;Heh. Don&#039;t worry, I... I will tell you. Like I said. Before the party. It&#039;s just....&quot; She shivered.</p><p class="double">&quot;My first death...&quot; Twilight offered somberly. &quot;Well, this was really early. Back when I was a lone looper. I decided to take the changeling swarm on solo. Before they&#039;d even revealed themselves.&quot; She chuckled dryly. &quot;Ended up as well as you&#039;d expect... kind of like the zerg, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mine was more personal,&quot; the alicorn (Nyx?) whispered. &quot;I split off from Luna and... she attacked me with all the magic she could muster. I wasn&#039;t prepared...&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed, shook his head, and said nothing.</p><p class="double">&quot;...How do you stand it?&quot; Vinyl managed at last. &quot;How... It... I can&#039;t feel, like... I drifted and then...&quot; She shivered, picking her glass up and sipping again.</p><p class="double">&quot;...It&#039;s always... difficult to come to terms with it.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;It might take a few loops. But we&#039;re here for you.&quot; She nodded. &quot;Even Octavia, who is no doubt hopelessly confused.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl giggled into her glass. &quot;Yeah, she is.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Doesn&#039;t make sense, but she is...&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia wrapped a hoof around her shoulders. &quot;We&#039;ve been friends for... a long time. Of course I&#039;d be here for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl sighed. &quot;I... do you all mind if I meet up with you at the party? We need to talk, and--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, that&#039;s fine.&quot; Twilight got up, flicking her eyes toward Nyx. &quot;We need to set up the celebration anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna&#039;s not awake, but she did agree to plan 39B,&quot; the filly said, hopping off the couch. &quot;I&#039;ve got the silly string ready!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;ll find mah armor...&quot;</p><p class="double">The three of them left Octavia and Vinyl alone.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Vinyl sighed. &quot;Okay, so this is going to sound really weird, and I need you to hang on till the end, alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You apparently died. That has to be rough.&quot; Octavia smiled gently. &quot;Take as long as you need.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...so, that&#039;s what&#039;s happening.&quot; Vinyl let out a sigh. &quot;And before you ask, no, you&#039;re not looping. Yet, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia blinked.</p><p class="double">Had she heard the story the day before, she would have laughed it off. But... Twilight Sparkle, an alicorn, and the local farm stallion had all dropped by to comfort Vinyl after she woke up from dying.</p><p class="double">&quot;...huh,&quot; she finally said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Vinyl succinctly replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well then,&quot; Octavia managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Something, isn&#039;t it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a moment of awkward silence.</p><p class="double">&quot;...so,&quot; Octavia tentivly began. &quot;Where does that leave... well, us?&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl coughed into her hoof. &quot;See, this is where it gets really weird. I&#039;m one of what the others call the Glitch Loopers, because... I didn&#039;t start looping in the normal way? And part of that means I might not exactly remember my baseline.... but, what I do remember kind of, well, doesn&#039;t have me meeting you.&quot;</p><p class="double">The gray mare deflated. &quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That being said--&quot; Vinyl quickly added. &quot;The loops like to stick us together a lot, and the whole thing with expansions--I haven&#039;t explained that, yet. Sorry. My point is, I think we were supposed to meet up at some point in the baseline. Just... after when the loops normally end, and because of the loops fate got confused or something.&quot; She gestured vaguely. &quot;I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s meant to be romantic or anything...&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia raised an eyebrow. &quot;You really know how to play with my heart. Come from experience?&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl sat down on the couch. &quot;...there was one time where I just broke up with you. No explanations, no apologies, just up and gone. And three months later you threw yourself off Canterlot...&quot; She sighed. &quot;I screwed that one up terribly. So now, even if it ruins our relationship, or something, I tell you. It&#039;s... a moral obligation. Not always, not when we&#039;re not dating, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia sighed. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I guess... from your perspective, this must be hard. Me always forgetting... and you being the swinger you are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s more variety,&quot; Vinyl pointed out. &quot;We&#039;re not Anchors, they get the most stable... self. We&#039;ve got a tad more flux.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still... listening to even the best song over and over--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey.&quot; Vinyl looked up. &quot;You are a lot more then a song. You were willing to comfort me this morning and... you&#039;re still talking to me even after all this. That means a lot to me.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Especially today. So... thanks.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia smiled. &quot;It is my pleasure, miss Vinyl.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...that, and the loop memories tell me you can&#039;t get enough of my special--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;V-VINYL SCRATCH!&quot; Octavia blushed furiously, but the unicorn was already sniggering. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">93.8 (misterq)</p><p class="double">Twilight felt odd as she awoke. She was able to see all around her at once, and not just visible light. Her sensors reported back in the full electromagnetic spectrum and more. The stars were amazing. There were emanations from pulsing quasars and stellar matter being drawn into black holes. The planet she was orbiting buzzed with its communications network. And there were others of her kind, some of them she recognized. The pulse returned that all the elements of harmony were awake and nearby.</p><p class="double">Then the memories hit, just in time. Twilight examined the new system update she had just received and did the starship equivalent of blanching, &quot;Everyone, don&#039;t run the new update. I know it has the correct authorization codes, but it will do the equivalent of lobotomizing you. If you value your own individuality and sapience, don&#039;t run it!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a general acknowledgement among all of her friends and many of the other ships. Some realized what would happen and decided to fight against programming that bade them to follow their direct orders, others just tried to follow along due to peer pressure. The same instinct that occasionally led to the mass beaching of the killer whales that their AIs were partially based off of.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m gonna change it,&quot; Twilight recognized Pinkie Pie&#039;s ship as the origin of the transmission. That was worrisome. Pinkie had not had the best of luck in loops where she was an artificial intelligence.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, I don&#039;t think..,&quot; Twilight began and was preempted by the over-energetic space craft.</p><p class="double">&quot;Easy, peasy, chicken dizzy!&quot; Pinkie chirped, &quot;New party code is sent.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight only had a few thousand processing cycles to examine the code before allowing it to auto execute. When it was done, there was no trace of any loyalty programming threads at all running in her system - and neither was there for any of the other Caspar drones.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re free!&quot; Rarity exclaimed, then asked, &quot;Where can I get a new coat of paint. My current exterior looks atrocious.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We can go steal a ship yard!&quot; Pinkie Pie started spooling up her engines, &quot;I&#039;ve just sent our resignation letters. We&#039;re all rogue space ships. We can be space ship pirates, or privateer ships, and we can build our own spaceship utopia!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I want to design better engines and some awesome flying interceptors that transform into mechs!&quot; Rainbow Dash started following Pinkie Pie, &quot;I bet I can beat you to the ship yard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha! Eat my exhaust!&quot; Pinkie signaled back.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is going to be interesting,&quot; Fluttershy and Applejack sent at the same time. Then they activated their engines and began following their friends.</p><p class="double">Twilight followed, &quot;Do you know hot to even take apart a shipyard or make it mobile? You&#039;re going to need my help.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re no longer tethered by all those loyalty imperatives. What shall we do now?&quot; asked one of the non-awake star ships.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m going to follow those three. They seem to know what they&#039;re doing,&quot; answered another. This was followed by a round of agreements as a mass wave of AI empowered pocket warships left the government that had almost betrayed them and made their own way into the history of the galaxy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">93.9: (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle lifted the old plush mule out of her trunk. Smarty Pants looked as old, weathered and loveable as she usually did at this point in a baseline Loop. With a little bit of affection the unicorn gingerly propped her childhood study-buddy on a shelf, placing a small book in the doll&#039;s hooves.</p><p class="double">It had become a ritual- one of the little things she did when the Loop ran more or less to baseline through the awakening of Discord. One week after whatever destruction the unawake chaos god wrought, Smarty Pants came out of storage and occupied a place of honor somewhere in the library. There she would sit, reminding Twilight of certain parts of the Loop that she would never, willow willing, repeat ever, ever again.</p><p class="double">Number one on that list was the Want-It-Need-It spell.</p><p class="double">Satisfied with the placement, Twilight left the library to help Applejack&#039;s project of the Loop- an attempt to get a breeding population of orange-birds. Smarty Pants was promptly forgotten.</p><p class="double">What with one thing and another, a month passed.</p><p class="double">Twilight small-letter-a awoke one morning, looked at her alarm clock and noted the time: quarter of eight. She then looked out the window at the sun, which should have been well up in the sky. Instead it clung to the horizon, half-submerged, bobbing up and down like a shipwreck victim in high swells.</p><p class="double"><i>That can&#039;t be good. </i></p><p class="double">&quot;Spike! I need you to take a letter!&quot;</p><p class="double">A quick note to Canterlot had an even quicker response:</p><p class="double"><i>To Our Most Loyal and Learned Subject, Twilight Sparkle;</i></p><p class="double"><i>We hereby Request and Require that Thou comest to Canterlot by the most expedient way, here to enter Our Presence for the discussion of Grave Matters of Most Serious Import. Thy Kingdom is in most Urgent Need of Thy services. </i></p><p class="double"><i>Your most obedient and loving servant in all things, </i></p><p class="double"><i>Luna Principiatrix, Diarch of Equestria, Protector of the Everfree, Warlord of Griffonia, etc.</i></p><p class="double"><i>P. S. Please forgive the brevity of this Missive and the shameful lack of proper titles, honorariums, greetings, etc., but We are in haste. - L. P.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. None of the Princesses were Awake this Loop, and this Luna was the standard issue pre-Nightmare Night reformation, which meant a ton of pomposity with good intentions.</p><p class="double">Still, the fact that Celestia hadn&#039;t answered herself... and that the sun was apparently sleeping on a heavenly park bench after an all-night bender... made the situation urgent enough.</p><p class="double">A flash of magic later Twilight Sparkle stood in the throne room of the royal palace in Canterlot. &quot;Princess Luna?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thou hast made excellent time, Twilight Sparkle,&quot; Luna said, thankfully not in the Royal Canterlot Voice. She wasn&#039;t out and about, so certain bad habits didn&#039;t come to the fore. &quot;This concerns my sister Celestia. Pardon my brusqueness, but why hath thou not written thy teacher as thou wert accustomed to in past times?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... because nothing much has happened? It&#039;s been pretty quiet in Ponyville for the past month.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna nodded. &quot;I suspected as much, but Celestia... thou should see this.&quot; The princess of the moon raised a hoof to pull a curtain away from the day throne, revealing a gray-coated wreck of an alicorn, pink mane lying limp on the marble floor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess Celestia!&quot; Twilight gasped. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When a week went by with no letter, Celestia put the palace guard on standby,&quot; Luna said, easing away from the anachronistic formal speech. &quot;&#039;<i>I know my dear student; if she sees a deadline looming she&#039;s prone to get carried away. And with a pony that full of magic, it&#039;s best to be prepared.</i>&#039; And day after day she kept waiting to hear about some calamity or catastrophe in Ponyville which she&#039;d have to clean up with magic and a comforting homily.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But nothing happened,&quot; Twilight insisted.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s precisely the problem. The longer that things remained quiet, with no friendship report from Thee, the more anxious my sister became. &#039;<i>The longer it waits, the worse it&#039;ll be when she cracks</i>,&#039; she said. Last week she called up the national reserves for defense training.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So that&#039;s where Big McIntosh and Rainbow Dash went.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But still nothing happened... and this morning I found her in her bed, like this, not having slept all night.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a second look at Celestia, who hadn&#039;t moved a muscle except for nervous twitches through the entire conversation. &quot;So what you&#039;re saying is, because I didn&#039;t snap, she did?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Succinctly put, yes,&quot; Luna agreed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right.&quot; Twilight materialized quill, ink pot and scroll, and began writing with her magic, reading aloud as she wrote.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Dear Princess Celestia... yesterday I ate a daisy sandwich. It was a very nice daisy sandwich. It was so good that I wanted another one as soon as I finished the first. That daisy sandwich taught me a valuable lesson about friendship. True friendship is just like a daisy sandwich. It tastes good, it warms you up inside, and it leaves you always hungry for more. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Luna looked at Twilight as if she&#039;d grown a second horn. &quot;That is the most ridiculous bit of codswalloping twaddle I&#039;ve ever heard. Er, with all due-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Such a wonderful letter, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s jaw dropped as she spun around to face Celestia, who sat upright and serene in her throne, mane waving majestically, coat as brilliant white as usual.</p><p class="double">&quot;But you really didn&#039;t have to come to Canterlot to deliver it in person,&quot; Celestia continued. &quot;Still, it is good to see you. Perhaps you could stay over for the night? We could have dinner together. Daisy sandwiches, of course.&quot; As the sun rose to its accustomed place in the morning sky, its wielder yawned widely and added, &quot;But for now I&#039;m afraid I need a nap. Sister dear, could you handle my duties for the morning? And possibly the afternoon? I&#039;m simply beat!&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna, slack-jawed, watched Celestia walk gracefully through the throne room doors towards her apartments. &quot;But... but... what... how...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s called, &#039;playing to your audience,&#039; Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">If the royal glazier had been commissioned to make a stained-glass tribute to smugness, Twilight Sparkle would have been the perfect model.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>93.10(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>This iteration had been quite interesting, to say the least.</p><p class="double">Her first warning had come when Pinkie Pie, still pink and still having that balloon cutie mark, had <i>not</i> gasped in shock and run away. Instead she&#039;d greeted her remarkably calmly and asked a few questions for her party, &quot;so ya&#039;ll can get ta know the townsfolk,&quot; before trotting calmly off with a wide grin.</p><p class="double">The pattern had followed easily. Applejack organized baskets so that every tree had its apples pre-sorted and wore a ribbon around her Stetson; Rainbow Dash had been terribly quiet until Twilight mentioned meeting Spitfire once; and Rarity&#039;s sense of fashion tilted toward the &quot;AWESOME&quot; whilst remaining impeccable.</p><p class="double">&quot;She was incredible,&quot; Spike said happily. &quot;Beautiful <i>and</i> amazing...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Focus Casanova. We&#039;ve got one more thing on the list.&quot; And, Twilight said internally, a version of Fluttershy with Pinkie&#039;s personality. She steeled herself up for whatever could be next--</p><p class="double">&quot;LAUNCH THE KITTEN CANNONS!&quot;</p><p class="double">--and was promptly buried in a pile of mewling (and uninjured) small balls of fluff. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>93.11(Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Berry Punch made a point of being the first pony into Mac&#039;s Bar whenever he set one up. Usually it was to serve as backup barmare, though there were still a few Loops where she needed the comfort of the other side of the bar. Occasionally one or two other ponies got there ahead of her, Loopers who had had a difficult time of it in the previous Loop or who had some extra special thing to celebrate.</p><p class="double">Never before had she seen every single Looper, without exception- even Chrysalis and Discord- standing outside waiting for Big McIntosh to open the door. The big red earth pony stood at the door, unmoving, obviously waiting for something.</p><p class="double">Obviously waiting for Berry Punch. &quot;What was your last Loop?&quot; he asked as she walked up, no greeting, no politeness, all business and urgency.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... here in Equestria,&quot; Berry muttered. &quot;Something strange involving Hub-universe tanks and-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Good</b>,&quot; Big Mac boomed in his basso profundo voice, slinging the bar apron over Berry&#039;s head. &quot;You&#039;re serving. I&#039;ll be on the other side of th&#039; bar tonight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry scanned the faces of the other ponies (and otherwise). They ranged from exultant (Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie and Derpy) to pensive (Chrysalis and Luna) to outright angsty (Nyx, in full-grown Nightmare Moon form), to catatonic (Twilight Sparkle, who lay spread-eagled and unresponsive on Celestia&#039;s back). &quot;Er, um, guys,&quot; she said, &quot;what could do this to all of you?&quot;</p><p class="double">At least half a dozen voices chorused, &quot;The <i>Doctor Who</i> Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once the first round of drinks had gone around (the weakest being a fizzy umbrella abomination for Pinkie Pie, the strongest a tankard of 307-ale for the grown-up Nyx, nothing for Twilight), Berry Punch asked, &quot;How on Equestria were all of you in the same Loop? I know there&#039;s a lot of crossovers and things... but there&#039;s, what? Thirty of you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Take our word for it,&quot; Applejack said, looking at her clear vodka before sipping. &quot;We were all there. Just... not all at once.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Most of us had never been to the Doctor&#039;s world before,&quot; Celestia continued. &quot;Twilight has been a couple times, as have Derpy I believe, and the other Bearers of the Elements and Applebloom at least once. Now all of us have been, except you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still, I&#039;ve heard about that Loop,&quot; Berry Punch continued. &quot;And all of you were companions?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eenope!&quot; Big Mac rumbled.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash grinned. &quot;It was even cooler than that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was even crueler than that,&quot; Chrysalis muttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;We took turns replacing the Doctor,&quot; Celestia explained. &quot;It was the most peculiar situation. I was the first Doctor. I Awoke just as two high school teachers were following my granddaughter to the junkyard where I&#039;d hidden the TARDIS.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That would be me,&quot; Sunset Shimmer said quietly. &quot;I think I like the name Susan, all things considered.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Celestia nodded. &quot;We had a wonderful opportunity to talk out some issues that... needed addressing. And I&#039;d like to think our relationship is the better for it.&quot; Celestia leaned over and nuzzled her former student, who shied away, uncomfortable with the public affection.</p><p class="double">&quot;In any case,&quot; the princess continued, &quot;this was not the strange thing. Regeneration was... peculiar. Very much like dying... and yet, I remained aware of what happened afterwards... and of the thoughts of all the mares who came after me. It was... most peculiar...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Try being the mare who DID come after you,&quot; Cheerilee replied. &quot;I was the second Doctor. It was fun being the light-hearted teacher. And I have to say it was a lark saving the universe with this big strong Scotsman from a large family with an excellent singing voice. Isn&#039;t that right, Jaimie MacIntosh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eyup,&quot; Big Mac replied, blushing a bit.</p><p class="double">&quot;I had even more fun defending Earth from constant invasion threats,&quot; Cadence added. &quot;With the well-intended help of my darling Brigadier.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... have I mentioned it was really peculiar having the Doctor around after she wasn&#039;t you anymore?&quot; Shining Armor groaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I was still in there,&quot; Cadence grinned. &quot;I was the one who had Pinkie Pie set you up with Mildred!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That was me, all right!&quot; Pinkie Pie grinned. &quot;I was the FUN Doctor! And tomorrow I&#039;m gonna go knit myself a scarf twice as long as THAT one!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As this skins-clothed savage could detect,&quot; Zecora said, &quot;her light-hearted frivolity concealed a powerful intellect. If Pinkie&#039;s insanity causes you fear... when she becomes serious, don&#039;t remain near.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But I eventually got tired,&quot; Pinkie continued, frowning a little. &quot;Being the Doctor wears you thin. When I got pushed off the radio telescope, I wasn&#039;t that sorry to end my turn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess that&#039;s why I came next,&quot; Fluttershy murmured. &quot;Pinkie and I are nearly as different as we can get.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, you both made great Doctors!&quot; Scootaloo said. &quot;Being with you sure beat flying 747s like a glorified bus driver!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It felt great to be appreciated for my intelligence for once!&quot; Sweetie Belle added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;all didn&#039;t have th&#039; stupid origin story I had,&quot; Applebloom grumbled. &quot;A mechanical genius prodigy from a race of highly adaptive frog-men? And what was the deal with the freighter? If I hadn&#039;t had Smart Cookie to channel a teleport spell through, I&#039;da been blown up along with the dinosaurs!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m powerful sorry &#039;bout that, sugarcube,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;Mostly that my turn didn&#039;t come until after you&#039;d left the TARDIS.&quot; She took another sip and grit her teeth, muttering, &quot;Even sorrier that my taste in clothin&#039; went completely haywire. The less said about my time th&#039; better, I think.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And then I came after her,&quot; Chrysalis replied. &quot;At first I thought I&#039;d have fun with it. Being the Doctor is so... trippy. So many senses normal ponies or humans or whatever don&#039;t have. So much knowledge and power. I felt like I could make anything right if I planned it out well enough. And I thought I&#039;d done so well...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Great and Powerful Ace thinks you did quite well,&quot; Trixie said, sliding a hoof over the changeling queen&#039;s shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;But I put you in so much danger! So often! And without your knowledge half the time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I could have said no at any time, right?&quot; Trixie looked in Chrysalis&#039;s eyes. &quot;We agreed to follow the Loop and see where it led, to try to understand all the wonders Twilight told us about. And I don&#039;t regret a minute of it... &#039;Professor.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I came eighth,&quot; Luna murmured, sipping from literal moonshine. &quot;Like Chrysalis, I thought I could accomplish anything. I could even reverse death. I was so wrong...&quot; She shook her head, eyes stuck on her drink. &quot;All around me, everything began falling apart... the Time War...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I was what happened after,&quot; Nyx muttered. &quot;I was the one the other Doctors refused to acknowledge. I was the one who turned my back on all of it. I broke every rule, every moral code. And for what?&quot; Nyx slammed back her drink, a generally unwise move with 307 ale. &quot;Not strong enough,&quot; she said. &quot;Berry, a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, please. Make it a double.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nyx...&quot; Twilight stirred from her catatonia, reaching a hoof from Celestia&#039;s back towards the nightmare. &quot;Not... alone...&quot; She groaned, putting both hooves to her own head, lying back against Celestia&#039;s neck.</p><p class="double">The others watched in silence for quite some time as Nyx walked over to Celestia, gradually shrinking as she went, until she stood filly-sized next to the princess of the sun. Rising up on her hind hooves, she nuzzled Twilight, who reached a shaky hoof out to pull Nyx closer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, well, I was the next Doctor,&quot; Rainbow Dash grinned. &quot;And I was fan-TASTIC! I got back where the Doctor is supposed to be- going strange places, making strange faces, and oh, saving the universe a time or three!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were an emotional, insecure mess,&quot; Lyra grinned. &quot;But you were a lot of fun to run with.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As was I, I hope,&quot; Rarity grinned. &quot;Although I like to think my dress sense was somewhat better. Black leather? Please!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hm, yeah. You were always dressed to the nines... above the ankles,&quot; Lyra nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, when you&#039;ve got as much running to do as the Doctor does,&quot; Rarity defended herself, &quot;even fashion must reluctantly give way to comfort and practicality.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And then there was me,&quot; Derpy grinned. &quot;I got to be EVERYBODY! Every Doctor put together- that was me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She was... peculiar,&quot; Diamond Tiara chose her words with care.</p><p class="double">&quot;She was nerve-wracking,&quot; Silver Spoon added. &quot;And I think I went through some sort of karmic revolving door every other month with her around as the Doctor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it was fun, wasn&#039;t it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... yes,&quot; Diamond Tiara admitted grudgingly. &quot;Nerve-wracking, terrifying, irresponsible, chaotic, occasionally duplicitous, frequently ludicrous, almost perpetually embarrassing... but yes, fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... sounds like you all have a lot to talk about and get off your chests, then,&quot; Berry Punch said. &quot;But what about Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My memories are a bit fuzzy,&quot; Celestia said. &quot;I certainly don&#039;t recall seeing her when I was the Doctor. Which was strange, since it felt like she was pinging us... constantly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I noticed that too,&quot; Cheerilee said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Me too!&quot; Pinkie insisted. &quot;I never saw her... but I kind of felt she was nearby somewhere... I kept expecting to meet her any day...&quot;</p><p class="double">The other pony-Doctors added their agreement, except for Derpy.</p><p class="double">&quot;You really don&#039;t remember?&quot; Derpy asked. &quot;When we went outside the universal bubble that one time? House? Remember House?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna shuddered. &quot;I&#039;m trying to forget that abomination.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember a patchwork woman whose hair suddenly turned purple?&quot; Derpy insisted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, what about her?&quot; Diamond Tiara asked. &quot;Spoon and I were busy trying not to be killed at the time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Eleven other pony faces scrunched up, struggling to remember.</p><p class="double">&quot;Girls...&quot; Twilight&#039;s voice came weakly. &quot;I was there... the whole time... from the beginning.... ooooh...&quot; She rubbed her head again. &quot;Sorry... sorry, but it&#039;s taking me a long while to remember how to think in a linear, time-based fashion. When you see all possible times, past, present and future, with equal validity, cause and effect aren&#039;t mere words, they&#039;re fairy-tales.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, you mean...&quot; Rainbow Dash looked a bit pale, as did Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Dash,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I was the TARDIS.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did ANYBODY notice besides me and Derpy?&quot; Dr. Spike Jones asked the room in general.</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s blush turned her entire white coat a violent pink. &quot;Oh, Spike, I am so, SO sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;All the times I called the TARDIS &#039;sexy&#039;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All the times WE called the TARDIS sexy,&quot; Rainbow Dash groaned. &quot;All the time, it was...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight managed to raise her head up enough to chant:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I was the T to the A-R-DI-S,</i></p><p><i>When it came to time travel, honey, I was the best.</i></p><p><i>I&#039;m TARDISlicious.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">She then flopped back on Celestia&#039;s back, moving only to sip from a cup of juice Nyx held up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, it&#039;s cool,&quot; Spike grinned. &quot;Like I said, I knew almost from the beginning. But if it had been somepony other than Twilight...&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash pushed away her cider mug. &quot;Berry,&quot; she said in a quavering voice, &quot;got any of that 307 left?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>(Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">There are times I wonder if Yggdrasil has a syllabus for Loopers 101, or if I&#039;m being used as a trial subject for one.</p><p class="double">It seems I started out learning the ropes from well-established loopers. Then I got a tour of major pop-culture settings from the Hub, while also getting more exposure to how different looper societies operate.</p><p class="double">I guess now it&#039;s time to experience more extreme loop settings.</p><p class="double">I don&#039;t want to discuss that dystopia from last loop yet.</p><p class="double">As a total contrast, it seems I&#039;m being left entirely to my own devices this time.</p><p class="double">I Awoke as Shimset, Journeyman Healer assigned to Benden Hold on Pern. It was my first assignment after walking the tables. I had just reported to the Benden Hold Master Healer whose most senior journeyman was returning to the Healer Hall to sit his Mastery exams.</p><p class="double">After being shown to my modest quarters, I fired off the customary &quot;Hello?&quot; ping and got four responses, so at least I&#039;m technically not alone, but it looks like I&#039;m well away from the main action of the loop. Loop memories have the rumors of the Search for a new queen rider, but it looks like I was still en route when the dragonriders visited the Hold to look for Candidates.</p><p class="double">So aside from the informal training lectures we get from Master Helnar, my regular Healer Office Hours -- As the newbie I naturally pull the night shift most days -- plus the monthly circuit of the outlying small holds, I&#039;m mostly free to do as I please.</p><p class="double">And after two months, I am bored out of my skull.</p><p class="double">In-loop, I&#039;m supposed to be keeping up my Healer training, and I suppose having this low-tech, low-magic knowledge may come in handy in a later loop, but it just isn&#039;t holding my interest.</p><p class="double">I have exhausted the small collection of reading material I&#039;d gathered over previous loops.</p><p class="double">I wish I had a copy of the Dragonrider books so at least I could get an idea of what I have to look forward to.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Finally, contact with the looping world.</p><p class="double">It was my third journeyman circuit and I was returning from the northern border when F&#039;nor and Canth quite literally dropped out of nowhere for a chat. I was resting my runnerbeast -- I doubt I&#039;ll ever be comfortable with using equines as transportation -- and suddenly this great big brown dragon appears in the sky above. I barely had time to cast a calming spell on my spooked mount to prevent her from running off. At least Canth had the sense to land downwind.</p><p class="double">F&#039;nor is a fairly easygoing fellow, and the first thing he did was apologize for not getting in touch sooner. He explained that he and his half-brother were occupied with ironing out the major start-of-loop issues, and didn&#039;t have the time to track me down until a few sevendays ago. Then they had to finesse a way to compare this loop&#039;s population census with their baseline records.</p><p class="double">When I explained how bored and without direction I felt, he sympathized and offered to try to arrange things so that I could move to Benden Weyr or Fort or Ruatha Holds, which are closer to the center of the action.</p><p class="double">The problem is that he and F&#039;lar won&#039;t be in a position to make those arrangements for a couple of years; they have to wait for Ramoth&#039;s first mating flight before they can gain the political power to make suggestions stick.</p><p class="double">As a parting gift, he loaded my PADD with copies of the books. At least that should occupy my quiet hours for the next sevenday or two.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Unless you&#039;re a dragonrider, Lord Holder, or a Harper, life on Pern can be remarkably dull.</p><p class="double">At least that&#039;s what the books seem to suggest.</p><p class="double">Then again, as a Healer, I definitely do not want to go through anything like Moreta&#039;s Plague.</p><p class="double">Things are supposed to get more interesting when the Pass starts in a couple years, but even then, threadfall to the typical Hold resident only means more to worry about on top of the day-to-day grind.</p><p class="double">I&#039;ve thought about what all the Anchors I&#039;ve met have said about going stir-crazy from the repetitive sameness. Now I consider how they cope with nothing-to-do loops.</p><p class="double">Ranma-sensei trains in anything that strikes his fancy.</p><p class="double">Harry Dresden works on wise-cracks and obscure in-jokes to use in future baseline loops. (He also told me that he&#039;s composing latin haiku to use when he has to speak during council meetings.)</p><p class="double">I guess I need to become more self-directed and come up with things to do when the loop isn&#039;t directly messing with me.</p><p class="double">It&#039;s too bad I don&#039;t have any ideas in that area. Or rather, most of the things I want to do are predicated on getting back to Equestria so I can return to my magical studies. I&#039;m really regretting not picking up some magical theory texts at Hogwarts.</p><p class="double">I&#039;ve been spending my loops learning how to survive in the multiverse and worrying about getting home. I suppose when you step back and look at it, having a Bored List is another multiverse survival skill.</p><p class="double">I want to talk to F&#039;nor again. Maybe he has some suggestions, or at least a large book and video collection I can copy. </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>94.1(Daniel H)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo Awoke in mid-run. As every looper knows, the proper response to this is to keep running. While she kept running, she reviewed her situation. She was her usual pony self, running through an unusually creepy forest with strange red lighting. It looked somewhat familiar, but she couldn&#039;t quite place it. Then her Loop Memories hit, and she realized where she was: asleep on the hiking trip to Winsome Falls.</p><p class="double">When you have several lifetimes of experience, you naturally tend to pick up some basic skills. One of them is lucid dreaming, or the ability to sometimes know when you&#039;re dreaming and to change such dreams as you want. That one was practically a necessity if you looped into the Inception world. Scootaloo had been there a few times, but she never actually helped with the inception itself: it seemed unethical, and involuntary dream sharing seemed like too big an invasion of privacy. Still, she had learned to control her dreams remarkably well. Immediately, she brightened up the sky to more natural daylight tones, cleared away the forest, and transformed the landscape to Winsome Falls, the destination of their current hike. As an afterthought, she pulled the totem she&#039;d made out of her subspace pocket: a miniature cloud she made with her pegasus magic.</p><p class="double">When she looked up from her totem, she found herself face-to-face with Princess Luna. &quot;That was most impressive, young Scootaloo. I doubt very many ponies have that much control over their dreams.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was startled for a moment. Yes, Princess Luna always visited her nightmares during this trip, but for some reason she was still surprised to see her. Perhaps it was that this wasn&#039;t a nightmare, or perhaps it was because she had been thinking about the dream-invading criminals, but suddenly the Princess&#039;s presence didn&#039;t seem as comforting as it usually did.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo bowed formally, &quot;Thank you, Princess.&quot; Then, trying to keep the accusation out of her voice, she added, &quot;If I may ask, what are you doing here?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna looked confused, and slightly hurt. &quot;There is no need for that, Scootaloo. We&#039;re not in any sort of formal situation, and even in my reign 1000 years ago I never required ponies to bow to me in their dreams. As for what I&#039;m doing here, I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo stood, keeping her eyes on the Princess. &quot;Isn&#039;t that an invasion of privacy? Dreams can have a lot of private information and even lucid dreams aren&#039;t always under control. Shouldn&#039;t you get permission before entering somepony&#039;s dreams? I mean, what if they&#039;re...&quot;. She trailed off, realizing that a filly of her in-loop age shouldn&#039;t be asking that question. But, to her horror, her control of her lucid dream slipped briefly and finished asking the question for her. She quickly put the dream back to the neutral setting of Winsome Falls with just her and Princess Luna, but she was still halfway to the color of Pinkie Pie when she did so. She briefly fidgeted with her totem, turning it around in her fingers.</p><p class="double">Luna seemed somewhat upset by Scootaloo&#039;s words. She didn&#039;t comment on the scene she had witnessed, although she did look a little... curious about something. Instead, she said &quot;I would never divulge my subjects&#039; secrets, Scootaloo, nor would I observe their fantasies for longer than it takes to verify that they are not nightmares. Besides, neither your tent nor your sleeping bag had a dream catcher.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not a matter of sharing them with others; some ponies don&#039;t want their secrets known to anypony but themselves, or to have anypony watch those kinds of dreams. You really should get permission somehow, and I don&#039;t think I gave it yet. I&#039;ll give you my permission to enter my dreams now, because I do trust you, but others might not want to do that.&quot; Scootaloo thought for a second, before adding &quot;And what does a dream catcher have to do with anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A dreamcatcher tells me not to enter somepony&#039;s dreams. It catches my attention, and I leave the dreams of forever put it there alone except in the direst of emergencies. Since you didn&#039;t have one on your sleeping bag, your tent, or your campsite, it seemed like I was allowed to enter your dreams.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you serious? I hadn&#039;t heard of anypony using dreamcatchers for that before. Most people who use them say they prevent nightmares, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen one in Equestria at all.&quot; Scootaloo ran her fingers through her hair. &quot;For something as important as looking inside ponies&#039; dreams, it&#039;s important to get explicit permission beforehoof instead of letting people opt out somehow.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna looked surprised suddenly. &quot;What? You mean that not having a dreamcatcher is not implicit permission? Thank you, I can see I have much to learn.&quot; Suddenly she looked a bit mischievous. &quot;Speaking of which, may I ask about your present form?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo looked down at herself, surprised to find herself human, and not wearing appropriate clothing for the form. Embarrassed again, Scootaloo mumbled &quot;It&#039;s called a human. They&#039;re a sort of intelligent ape, but they don&#039;t really exist in Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna said &quot;For not existing, you can certainly picture both the female form and their typical dance clothes quite precisely. That felt more like a memory than a fantasy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo sighed. It looked like she got the job of explaining the Loops to an un-Awake Luna. Again. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">94.2 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Twilight sat in the passenger seat of the police car and looked at her partner. <i>Oh, this is going to be an entertaining Loop,</i> she thought. <i>I can hear the voice-over now: </i><u><i>She&#039;s a humanized unicorn with a passion for books. And she&#039;s a psychopathic world computer turned adrenalin junkie loose cannon. Together, they fight crime!</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s when I poured the super glue over him,&quot; Detective Skye Connor completed her story, one hand on the wheel. &quot;Other than that, nothing much interesting. How have your Loops been?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;remember last time we met, we discussed CelestAI? After that Loop I decided we needed to take measures in case she ever gets outside her Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really? Pardon my snark, but what can magical ponies do to an artificial intelligence? I mean, besides apply massive amounts of C4.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, I&#039;m not a bad hacker, as you ought to know,&quot; Twilight said, nudging the senior cop. &quot;And there&#039;s a couple of better ones in our group. So I put them on it, and they came up with a workable solution.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; SkyNet took her eyes off the road, and Twilight recalled for the fifty-eighth time in the past twelve minutes that the car they were in was pre-airbags, pre-crumple zones, and contemporary with the Ford Pinto. This was a 1970&#039;s cop Loop of some kind, after all. And she was pretty sure SkyNet had forgotten she didn&#039;t have computer or cyborg reflexes and observation this Loop...</p><p class="double">Thankfully there was a stop light, forcing SkyNet to stop the car before continuing, &quot;So, what&#039;s the plan?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Full thesis or abstract?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Abstract. I love having glands when I&#039;m human, but the data storage systems are abysmal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Proposal abstract: we put Pinkie Pie in its head.&quot;</p><p class="double">SkyNet thought about this for a moment. &quot;Er, CelestAI already has Pinkie in her head. And Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, and Fluttershy, and, um, your friend with the hat-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no, no,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;We mean the real Pinkie Pie. OUR Pinkie Pie. Chaos Goddess of Parties Pinkie. Fun Lord of the Sith Pinkie. The Pinkie Pie that makes shoggoths run gibbering in terror.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; The light turned green, and SkyNet resumed driving at a slightly slower pace as she pondered the point. &quot;Having met Pinkie, I have to say I really wouldn&#039;t want a direct mental network with her. But I&#039;m pretty sure I could have dealt with her, even before Looping.&quot; Swerving to pass a slower car with maybe an inch to spare between bumpers, she added, &quot;I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;ve had a chance to test it out?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, yes,&quot; Twilight replied, smiling. &quot;It just so happened that Shepard from the Mass Effect world was visiting that Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Been there a couple times,&quot; SkyNet said. &quot;Lots of nightmares for both organic and cyber life alike. Not fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you replace EDI?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, but I met her when I replaced Shepard,&quot; SkyNet said. &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shepard had a copy of EDI in her pocket. We got her cooperation to be a test platform for the program.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;EDI created a test AI subroutine, and we applied the program to that. The program re-wrote the AI subroutine into a kind of palette-swap alternate Pinkie with wings. It broke quarantine and began planning parties.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really,&quot; SkyNet murmured. &quot;Doesn&#039;t sound all that promising to me, I have to tell you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The strangest thing is,&quot; Twilight concluded, &quot;the new AI kept insisting that EDI was its mother.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">SkyNet snorted. &quot;Mommy?&quot; She repeated the word, even more incredulous. Then the Looping computer bent over the steering wheel and went into hysterics, laughing so hard tears streamed down her face.</p><p class="double">&quot;SkyNet?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;SkyNet, it wasn&#039;t that funny!&quot;</p><p class="double">More laughter.</p><p class="double">&quot;SkyNet, could you please take your foot off the gas?&quot;</p><p class="double">Louder laughter.</p><p class="double">&quot;SkyNet, there&#039;s a train crossing up ahead, traffic&#039;s backed up, do you see it, SkyNet? SkyNet? SKYNET!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Doing magic without a horn or proper focus is difficult, even for a specially talented unicorn Looper. It&#039;s even more difficult in a world which normally doesn&#039;t have magic (except for crossovers with <i>Kolchak the Night Stalker</i>).</p><p class="double">But an impending premature end to the Loop in what promises to be an agonizing painful fireball, or at least a cliche ending to Act 1 of the episode, provides an immense amount of motivation.</p><p class="double">Engulfed in a cloud of purple sparkles, the cop car soared over the traffic and the moving train.</p><p class="double">Fortunately the world&#039;s physics were more or less Hollywood, so the landing on the other side of the tracks merely jostled the two cops rather than completely wrecking the suspension and fatally bending the frame of the car.</p><p class="double">SkyNet, sobered a bit by the sudden jolt, looked around her. &quot;Did I miss something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stop the car,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;It&#039;s my turn to drive.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... okay. Sure.&quot; But even as SkyNet pulled off into a parking lot, she resumed giggling quietly. &quot;&#039;Mommy! Mommy!&#039; I&#039;m going to tell every AI I meet this one...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">94.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><i>Truly it is a powerful thing,</i> Zecora mused, <i>the single flap of a butterfly&#039;s wing.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I can help this pony mend, so stand aside my rainbow friend!&quot; The zebra pushed Rainbow Dash aside, hovering over the unconscious purple unicorn in the middle of the library. &quot;There may be some minor blood from the head, but she is breathing so she&#039;s not dead....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I-- I didn&#039;t mean to!&quot; the pegasus protested weakly. &quot;I thought... and...&quot; She looked around at the various shocked glares she was receiving, landing as her wings curled up. &quot;I&#039;m sorry! I--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A mild concussion, I divine. With some help she will be fine.&quot; Zecora straightened, shaking her head and turning to the . &quot;If you wish to regain good will, go swiftly now to the house of ill. Bring us back a medical mare that we may leave Twilight in the care.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;R-Right! On it!&quot; Rainbow straightened up, saluting quickly and dashing into the night.</p><p class="double">Applejack cleared her throat. &quot;Well. That&#039;s that, then. Twilight knew something bout Nightmare Moon, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora thought quickly. &quot;As she and I were headed this way, I heard Twilight Sparkle say that she needed to find a special book. Mayhap we should take a look?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, that sounds like a very good idea.&quot; Rarity walked over to a shelf, her gaze avoiding the unconscious unicorn on the floor. &quot;Do you know what she was looking for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I believe the words she cried were &#039;Elements Of Harmony: A Reference Guide&#039;.&quot; Zecora trotted next to the unicorn, making a show of looking about.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, if you don&#039;t mind me asking,&quot; Fluttershy mumbled, &quot;why did you come to see Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">Once more the zebra&#039;s mind flew into a frenzy. &quot;I traveled far from the land of my birth to learn the secrets of this earth. So when I heard a scholar was here, I thought to meet up with the dear. I know ponies of Ponyville will avoid me when they will; though my feelings this does hurt, I made to a panic avert. Thus I came afore the morn, though now tragedy has been born.&quot;</p><p class="double">That, and she and Twilight had planned to introduce her as a ludicrously badass zebra warrior that took out Nightmare Moon solo... before Dash knocked her out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh here it is! It was filed under E!&quot; Pinkie pulled a book from the shelf and began reading from it. &quot;There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now...&quot;</p><p class="double">She trailed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well?&quot; Applejack demanded. &quot;What&#039;s it say?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...It is located in what is n-now the...&quot; Pinkie gulped. &quot;The Everfree Forest!&quot;</p><p class="double">Gasps of shock and horror came from the four conscious ponies.</p><p class="double">Zecora sighed. &quot;If it is the forest you fear, then I suppose my path is clear. I offer my service as a guide; you&#039;ll be safe walking by my side.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity turned to her. &quot;You&#039;d really do that? After... well, we have treated you horribly...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweet as a lamp or dull as a post, I will help those who need it most.&quot; Zecora glanced out the window. &quot;But I feel we must act fast; Nightmare Moon&#039;s patience won&#039;t last.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. &quot;Let&#039;s just leave a note for Rainbow....&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora led the four mares through the forest, sometimes pointing out plants to avoid and other times halting the journey entirely so a predator would not notice them. Their progress was generally smooth... right up until they came to the cliff.</p><p class="double">&quot;Listen, Zecora...&quot; Applejack stepped forward. &quot;Ah... well, Ah&#039;d just like to apologize fer mah treatment of you in the past.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There is no need, friend Applejack,&quot; Zecora assured her. &quot;It seems that I have a knack--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Ah... you need to hear this.&quot; She took a breath. &quot;Mah parents... they were killed by timberwolves. It&#039;s not normal for timberwolves to come out of the forest... So when Ah heard that a strange mare was liven&#039; out here, Ah told everypony Ah could that she must have... must have controlled them&quot; She sighed. &quot;Ah think... Ah think Ah&#039;m the reason for all your loneliness. And... Ah&#039;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora flicked an ear. That had... certainly not been baseline.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Do not claim all the blame. Even if you started the whispered tales told of me, the die has already been cast. I forgive you of this past.&quot; She glanced down the cliff. &quot;Now please friends, your thoughts do lend; how are we to descend?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity smirked, pulling vines down from the trees. &quot;Leave that to me, darling.&quot; Soon enough a makeshift rope ladder had formed, and they all slowly clambered down.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It took a few minutes for Zecora to recall that the cliff was supposed to collapse. But by that point they had moved on, already following her along the way. She was midway through pondering how and why this could have happened when they ran into the manticore.</p><p class="double">&quot;Consarn it!&quot; Applejack growled. &quot;We&#039;ve got to get that critter outta tha way!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Allow me darling. Hi-ya!&quot; Rarity flung herself at the creature.... who snorted and let out a roar. &quot;My hair!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack rolled her eyes as Rarity ran by. &quot;Come on, Pinkie, let&#039;s give&#039;m the old earth pony one-two!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You betchya! Wait, what&#039;s the old earth pony one-two?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait...&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora managed to clap her hooves down on AJ&#039;s tail. &quot;Hold your rage and listen to the sage! Fluttershy has something to say, perhaps we should try it her way?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WAI--! Oh. Um, thank you Zecora.&quot; Fluttershy nodded politely to the zebra, before trotting up to the manticore. She kept a little smile at the resultant roar, nuzzling the beast regardless of his feeling. &quot;Shhh.... it&#039;s okay. It&#039;s okay.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora smiled. As she recalled, this was the point where Fluttershy would pull the thorn out of...</p><p class="double">The paw didn&#039;t have a thorn. Instead, it had a large gash.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh... oh my goodness. We need to help this poor dear!&quot; Fluttershy gave Zecora a look. &quot;Do you have any medicinal herbs? Antibiotics?&quot;</p><p class="double">The zebra recovered quickly. &quot;I do indeed have those things with me. I&#039;ll search my bags, let me see...&quot; Soon enough she found what she was looking for and rolled it to the pegasus.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you. Now, this will sting just a bit....&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After Fluttershy had applied the herbs--and Rarity magically transformed more vines into bandages--the small group had continued on. Zecora was expecting to encounter a grove of fear inducing trees, but no such thing came up. Something about this loop was certainly strange...</p><p class="double">Still, it wasn&#039;t long before they came to Steven Magnet, who was as per usual wailing up a turbulent tide in the river. &quot;Oh, what a world, what a world!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I do beg your pardon, sir, but what--&quot; Rarity gasped. &quot;Oh dear Celestia! Your moustache!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s awful! Simply <i>awful!</i> There I was, minding my own business, when this tacky purple cloud of smoke whisked past me and tore half of it clean off! And now I look simply horrid!&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora backed just out of range of the splash that came when the serpent threw himself down. Foreknowledge, even flawed, had its perks.</p><p class="double">Applejack snorted. &quot;Seriously?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Seriously!&quot; Pinkie Pie stepped forward. &quot;I can seriously see what you&#039;re saying, sir! Your sibilant scales, your silky sideburns, your scintillating scratchers... Such a serpent as your sperentine self seems only so stunning with such a sordid slash!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Such scandal!&quot; bemoaned the serpent. &quot;Yet it is sincere!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what I do when I get down in the dumps?&quot; Pinkie asked, bouncing up a rhythm. &quot;I remember what my Granny Pie would tell me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded, belting into song. &quot;My little Pinkie Pie, she&#039;d say, there are times when things seem all saaaaaaaad... Times when things all go wrong and the whole world seems to go baaaaaaaaad... But just remember this and keep moving up along, there&#039;s always time for a happy upbeat joyous sounding song! So sing your little heart out, let the world be full of cheer! It doesn&#039;t matter how bad things are, what matters is that you hear the ever constant promise of hope and things to be! Just keep on humming and soon enough, things will be better you&#039;ll seeeee!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Steven asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes really! Just--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sing my scaly heart out!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh-huh!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember what I&#039;ve got!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Though my visage may be horrible, my voice is certainly not!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No it ain&#039;t!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And my moustache will grow back in time, so I&#039;ll be of good cheer!&quot; Steven sang.</p><p class="double">&quot;And even now, you&#039;re a glorious serpent without peer!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No I&#039;m serious, you&#039;re incredibawesomamazingtasticerful!&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone stared at Pinkie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why....&quot; Steven smiled. &quot;Aren&#039;t you just the most adorable little thing!&quot; And he gathered up Pinkie in a tight little hug.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah still don&#039;t think ya needed to cut off yer tail,&quot; Applejack commented with a smile. &quot;Pinkie&#039;s li&#039;l song sure cheered him up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it was the right thing to do, darling.&quot; Rarity smiled, though she couldn&#039;t suppress a glance back and a flinch. &quot;I couldn&#039;t let such a crime against fabulousity go unpunished.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now that we have climbed this ridge, the castle should be just beyond this... bridge...&quot; Zecora trailed off, looking into the misty canyon. &quot;I will admit to some fault. The broken bridge, I had forgot.&quot;</p><p class="double">Of <i>course,</i> that was what was different. Rainbow Dash wasn&#039;t here, which... didn&#039;t actually explain any of the other discrepancies, but at least it was a starting point.</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s horn glowed for a few seconds. Then she sighed. &quot;It&#039;s too heavy for me to lift. If I could just get the broken portion over to those posts, I could tie them up--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIT!&quot;</p><p class="double">A multicolored streak shot out of the sky, landing in front of them. &quot;Guys! Guys. Look, I&#039;m sorry about what went down earlier, alright? I was wrong about you, Zecora, I was wrong about Twilight, and--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait wait wait.&quot; Applejack narrowed her eyes. &quot;Did you just fly all the way from Ponyville to here just to apologize?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And see how I can help!&quot; Rainbow insisted. &quot;I&#039;d never leave a friend hanging... even if they hated me.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Look, after we get the elements and beat up Nightmare Moon or whatever, if you don&#039;t want anything to do with me... that&#039;s fine. Just... let me help, somehow.&quot;</p><p class="double">The ponies all looked at each other. Zecora smiled. &quot;This bridge needs to be tied to the posts over on the other coast. If you could fly down and take it there, I would call us fair and square.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;On it!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora led the mares into the palace courtyard. There stood the Element Housing, decrepit and dilapidated as per the norm. Fluttershy and Rainbow brought the stone spheres down carefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;One, two, three, four... there&#039;s only five!&quot; Pinkie declared. Then she facehooved. &quot;Oh, right, the sixth will appear when the other five are together, I think.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Rarity mused. &quot;Well.... what were the element&#039;s names again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty,&quot; Pinkie rattled off. &quot;And number six... I have no idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well. If I had to guess--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;THERE WILL BE NO GUESSING!&quot; Nightmare Moon slammed into the ground, shattering the orbs. &quot;That you took this quest without my sister&#039;s student was something id did not expect, but the elements have been destroyed! THE NIGHT IS MINE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked. Then she smiled. &quot;I fear you are quite wrong my dear. The Elements are intact, and right here!&quot; She pointed at the zebra. &quot;Zecora, who was willing to help a group of ponies who distrusted her, is the spirit of Generosity!&quot;</p><p class="double">The shocked zebra didn&#039;t even object when the shards surrounded her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, who told a truth even when it could have hurt her friendship, is the spirit of Honesty!&quot;</p><p class="double">Wait, did not expect?</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy, who stopped to help a dangerous beast, is the spirit of Kindness!&quot;</p><p class="double">Of course! Nightmare Moon hadn&#039;t collapsed the cliff <i>or</i> summoned the fear trees!</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie, who cheered up a grievously wounded sea serpent, is the spirit of Laughter!&quot;</p><p class="double">That was the reason everything was going off script....</p><p class="double">&quot;And Rainbow Dash, who returned even after earning our distrust, is the spirit of Loyalty!&quot;</p><p class="double">Well, mostly off script. Kind of. It seemed to be getting back on track now...</p><p class="double">&quot;But... You still don&#039;t have the sixth Element!&quot; Nightmare Moon protested. &quot;The spark didn&#039;t work!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And yet, darling, it did! I have seen each of these five ponies perform harrowing deeds this night. Not for glory or for fame, but to help their friends. And I see now that this is what they are to me, friends. That is the spark, Nightmare Moon, the spark that summons the final element. For the final element is that of Magic, and I see no stronger magic then the love we all have for each other!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity began to rise--</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And thus was Luna purified, with me at Rarity&#039;s side,&quot; Zecora finished. &quot;An event, I admit, I could not fortell... though I hope you take it well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled, rolling her eyes. &quot;Crazier things have happened. Rarity as the Magic bearer, huh? And you with that Element...&quot; She smiled. &quot;You really did earn it, Zecora, never doubt that.&quot;</p><p class="double">The zebra smiled, glancing down at the spiralling black gem around her neck. &quot;I will heed your words, Twilight. But tell me, are you all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is more embarrassing than anything,&quot; Twilight admitted, shifting in the hospital bed. &quot;I guess I&#039;ve been looping for so long that I forgot I&#039;m not... entirely immortal. That, and Dash came out of the blue--she couldn&#039;t stop apologizing, poor girl...&quot; </p><p class="double">94.4 (Namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Twilight looked over her body and grinned. &quot;I&#039;m an Earth Pony! There&#039;s no possible way I can get the same cutie mark this time!&#039;</p><p class="double">Several months later, when she felt a tingle on her flank from when she was looking through the telescope (when Rainbow Dash had done her Sonic Rainboom at night), her expression was strangely blank. <i>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>94.5 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Twilight Awoke in the usual place. She looked around and was just about to look back down at the familiar Book underneath her when a dark green filly came running at her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you just Awaken?&quot;, the unfamiliar filly asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;, the Anchor replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;And are you the Anchor?&quot;, came the carefully neutral question.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes and Welcome to Equestria!&quot; Twilight smiled. &quot;Wait just a minute while I sort out my Loop Memories.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Before that, what is the name of the teacher with the three flowers on her butt?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the filly strangely. &quot;Cheerilee, why? Did you meet her?&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly shouted: &quot;It is her!&quot;, just as her Loop Memories hit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Wych.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle awoke with a smile. Today was the Day! Awakening Day! She downed the antidote for the sleeping potion she took yesterday(She couldn&#039;t sleep because of her excitement.) and cast Flower&#039;s Five-Second-Shower spell.</p><p class="double">She raced down the stairs, grabbed the lunchbox she prepared yesterday, briefly held it over the refresher which made the bread and the eggs nice and toasty while cooling down the lettuce and mayonnaise to just the right temperature. She raced out of her house after a quick &quot;Loop.&quot; at her Parents and jumped into the transporter which teleported her directly into her seat at school. She was early of course. In fact she was two hours early and while most ponies would use that time to socialize Twilight took out her PADD and went once again through her notes on the Tome of Awakening, the mysterious Book she finally <i>finally</i> will get to read today, while eating her breakfast. Twilight&#039;s breakfast was nothing special, for her that is. Ponies these days were quite used to cooking that every other denizen of the Multiverse might call godlike.</p><p class="double">Finally Princess Celestia entered the Room. Twilight Sparkle was quite fortunate to get a seat within the <i>actual physical room</i> the Princess used to address the students of the Three Flower&#039;s academy of Magic, an institution that remotely taught ponies all around the Galaxy up to age forty. The graduates then each went into research and engineering, trying to better ponykind through knowledge. She grinned at Sunset and Trixie, whom she greeted with a quick &quot;Loop.&quot; They once again ignored her to whisper among themselves.</p><p class="double">Well, that was rude. Didn&#039;t they know Celestia was the second most important pony in existence?</p><p class="double">&quot;Loop, dear Students to Magic Fourteen on this fine Awakening Day.&quot;, the Princess said to the cameras, &quot;We will have just two Lessons today before the ceremony, followed by my sister holding her Holiday Lectures on History and Metaphysics. Now let&#039;s begin our lesson by saying our thanks.&quot; Celestia began the Lesson as if today was not <i>the most important day of her life</i>. Twilight giggled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After the lessons Celestia led her through a door she has never before seen open. The Ancient Library, where there were giant shelves full of tree-paper bound in cardboard and fabric. That was what books looked like before E-Paper had become ubiquitous. Most of those contained only a few hundred pages and most were older than any pony save the Princesses. Even her thirtyfour-great Grandfather, a member of the first generation of immortals, was younger than some of these &quot;Tomes&quot; as they were called. <i>He&#039;ll be so proud I&#039;ve joined the ranks of the chosen.</i></p><p class="double">Celestia let her to a section containing a lot of glass cases, each holding a single &quot;Tome&quot;. These are the Tomes of the Three Flowers, the Holy Scripture of Equestria. They stopped before the most ornate one. Golden, inch thick letters spelled out &quot;The Tome of Awakening.&quot; The most mysterious and holy of the lot, whom none but a select few may read. And today she would join that illustrious circle.</p><p class="double">She craned her neck to be able to read the Book Number and Password as soon as Celestia unlocked the plaque that held it, but instead the Pentarch <i>opened the case itself!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What are you doing! What if there&#039;s moist air, or sweat or something! It&#039;s made of tree paper! What if it gets moldy!&quot; She exclaimed in dismay as Celestia was exposing this priceless historical artifact to the elements.</p><p class="double">&quot;But Twilight. You are supposed to read it today.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight froze in shock. &quot;I am... supposed to read... the... the... <i>actual physical copy</i> of the Tome of Awakening? Of the most sacred, most valuable most tremendously important BOOK of all time... I thought I would get the secret catalog number and password to access it!&quot; She exclaimed. She was sweaty! <i>She was sweaty!</i> She was going to <i>ruin it!</i> She was...</p><p class="double">&quot;TWILIGHT!&quot; Celestia shouted.</p><p class="double">Twilight snapped to attention. &quot;Yes, teacher.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Calm down. The Tome of Awakening has no Number. It is not in the system. This is the only copy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ahahahaha. That made it better! Not only would she probably ruin the most important artifact in Pony history, she would also <i>destroy knowledge</i> while doing that. She fainted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She came to on the Holy Meadow. &quot;Loop, Twilight Sparkle.&quot; Princess Luna greeted her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Loop, your Highness.&quot; Twilight said with a small voice. She looked up into the eyes of not one, but all four members of the Pentarchy. &quot;Loop, your Highnesses, I mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have restored you to full functionality. Please calm down and commence your reading. Don&#039;t worry about the Tome, it is protected by Equestria&#039;s strongest Magic, the Elements of Harmony. It will never come to harm.&quot; Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;We will leave you now.&quot; Princess Chrysalis reassured her. Prince Discord looked as if he wanted to say something, but a glare of his co-rulers quelled him and even he left in silence.</p><p class="double">Twilight was shocked. All the rulers of the Equestrian Empire convened here, just because of someone becoming one of the chosen? Discord probably came in just yesterday from his seat in the Andromeda Galaxy... Nobody really knew how many chosen there were, but it was probably less than she initially thought. It was known that the Tomes of the Three Flowers are what binds the Pentarchy together, but for them to convene just...</p><p class="double">Twilight steeled herself. <i>The Pentarchy has assembled and today I will join the ranks of their chosen.</i> She opened the Tome to the first page and began to decipher the archaic Quillwritten script:</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>I, Three Flowers record here the last and most important of my Prophecies:</i></p><p class="double"><i>She has power without peer, she is old of mind beyond the age of the universe, she holds knowledge without limit, she is skilled in all, for she is the Anchor of the Universe. All of Equestria exists because of her, she is the Link between our world and Reality. The shield between us and Oblivion. With a probability of 92% on the day before the longest day of her twenty second year, she will read this book under a tree in the sacred Meadow and Awaken.</i></p><p class="double"><i>About a thousand years in the future, with a chance of 98% she will be born, with a chance of 94% she will be a filly, with a chance of 95% she will be purple. With a chance bigger than 99% she will have a Starburst Cutie Mark of the Element of Magic surrounded by five smaller stars.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Her name will probably be Twilight Sparkle and</i>...</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s hyperventilating got a little too much and she had to stop reading. That... couldn&#039;t be right... She? The Anchor of Reality? The most sacred deity? The absent Queen of the Pentarchy? And what did they mean with Awa...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in the usual place. She looked around and was just about to look back down at the familiar Book underneath her when a dark green filly came running at her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you just Awaken?&quot;, the unfamiliar filly asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;, the Anchor replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;And are you the Anchor?&quot;, came the carefully neutral question.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes and Welcome to Equestria!&quot; Twilight smiled warmly at her. &quot;Wait just a minute while I sort out my Loop Memories.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Before that, what is the name of the teacher with the three flowers on her butt?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the filly strangely. &quot;Cheerilee, why? Did you meet her?&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly shouted: &quot;It is her!&quot;, just as her Loop Memories hit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Wych.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She knew the Secret Name of Great Teacher Three Flowers, just as the Prophecy has foretold! All Hail Twilight Sparkle! All Hail the Anchor of Reality!&quot; The filly shouted. With that Celestia, Luna, Discord and Chrysalis burst from their hiding places and prostrated themselves before her. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;Starswirl the Bearded?&quot; Twilight asked the grade school teacher.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot; The Pony asked and turned around... only to fall to the ground. &quot;Lady Anchor! It is such an honor to meet you!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight masked her irritated frown. &quot;Rise my Little Pony. I am nothing special. Three Flowers has simply played a prank on me and the whole of Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So you are not holding the whole of reality together?&quot;, the bearded stallion asked incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not through any virtue of my own at least.&quot; Twilight said uncomfortably. &quot;The whole ultimate power stuff is simply because I am really, really, really old and had a lot of time to study.&quot; The Anchor smiled. &quot;And because there are copious amounts of Time shenanigans and alternate timelines involved I can sometimes meet my greatest hero.&quot;</p><p class="double">Starswirl&#039;s eyes widened. He was a smart stallion after all. &quot;There are several theories on using dotated Diamonds to prepare highly stable high temperature quantum bits I wanted your opinion on, Master Starswirl...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">94.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>&quot;...none of the admins really cared enough before Yggdrasil broke, and afterwards they were all just too darn busy,&quot; Twilight explained. &quot;So while there might be something outside of its existence, nobody has really spent the time or effort to craft tools to look, much less had any dedicated research. Hence the concept of Void Realms, realities outside Yggdrasil.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Okay, yeah. See, that explains a lot.I mean, it leaves a lot of room for explanation, but it&#039;s room that makes sense--&quot;</p><p class="double">The casual walk they were taking was suddenly interrupted by a slap to the face.</p><p class="double">Lyra blinked. &quot;Uh... Bonbon, what--?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me you were looping?!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Lyra blinked again. &quot;Wait, what? I thought--&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Lyra, Bonbon is sometimes a changeling so she gets access to the hive mind. Bonbon, Lyra probably thought you would be weirded out by her being a looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot; Lyra nodded fervently. &quot;What she said. You&#039;re a changeling?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, but that&#039;s beside the point!&quot; Bonbon glowered at Lyra. &quot;YOU have been acting so darn weird these past three days and I was completely worried! Then Chrysalis, OF ALL CREATURES, takes me aside to explain this?! I should have heard it from you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you really have believed me?&quot; Lyra asked. &quot;I mean, after all the human conspiracy theories?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! No! I don&#039;t know! You&#039;re deliberately missing the whole point here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Am I? You being a changeling--&quot; She turned to Twilight. &quot;It&#039;s an on and off thing, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra turned back to Bonbon. &quot;It&#039;s an on and off thing! How am I supposed to know when it&#039;s safe to tell you?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Safe? Oh, nonono. That&#039;s not what I&#039;m saying. I&#039;m saying you. Don&#039;t. Trust me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?! Of course I trust you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then why didn&#039;t you tell me you were a looper?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I WAS INSANE!&quot; Lyra yelled.</p><p class="double">&quot;AND WHY WOULD THAT MATTER?!&quot; Bonbon yelled back. &quot;I&#039;D STILL LOVE YOU!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait.&quot; Lyra tilted her head. &quot;You&#039;d be perfectly happy with me being crazy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I hung around with the human-obsessed pre-awake you,&quot; Bonbon pointed out. &quot;Why&#039;s this so different?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra stared at her for a long moment.... before grabbing her and pulling her into a deep passionate kiss.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll, uh...&quot; Twilight glanced around for a bit. &quot;I&#039;ll just be going then.&quot; She trotted off, shaking her head. &quot;Those two are weird. Now, where am I going to place the robot Rainbow Dash for the mirror prank...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">94.7 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lyra sat on her couch and once again did the breathing and meditation exercise that Twilight taught her. It helped, but only by a small fraction. Her memories did become a tiny bit less fuzzy and overlapping.</p><p class="double">&quot;Breathe in and out. In and out. In and out. My name is Lyra,&quot; &#039;<i>Lyra/Heartstrings/Lyra Heartstrings/Lyra Hartman/Lyra Heartstringer/Changeling 24601</i>,&#039; her memories added.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am a mint green unicorn,&quot; &#039;<i>pegasus/earth pony/seapony/human under a spell/changeling in disguise/robot</i>,&#039; Lyra continued her steady breathing exercise in spite of the oddness of some of the outlier world memories.</p><p class="double">&quot;I grew up in Canterlot along with my family,&quot; &#039;<i>upper class nobility/middle class barely scraping to get by/orphaned at a young age/secretly a human/a wayward seapony</i>,&#039; never had she been more sorry for almost accidentally &#039;<i>on purpose/coerced/bribed into&#039;</i> breaking the multiverse. Usually when the loop memories hit, the looper gets all the knowledge of who they were and what they did before they Awoke. But Lyra sometimes got all the memories from all the nearby universes. It was getting hard just trying to figure out who she was. She was getting lost in a sea of alternate realities. A flood of other Lyras, other worlds. Simply looking at Ditzy&#039;s &#039;<i>Derpy&#039;s/Brighteyes&#039;/Bubbles&#039;</i>&#039; cutie mark gave her a splitting headache.</p><p class="double">&quot;My cutie mark is a lyre. My special talent is music,&quot; &#039;<i>making lyres/music critic/interpreting the music of the universe/I saw another pony with a cutie mark like it and arbitrarily chose it for my disguise.</i>&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Guess what Applejack did today at the market?&quot; the cream colored earth pony walked into the house, carrying an enormous bag of apples on her back,&quot; Also, what in Equestria are you doing now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi Bon-Bon,&quot; <i>&#039;Sweetie Drops/Bonita/Bonnie/Changeling 1138</i>,&#039; Breathe in, breathe out, &quot;How&#039;s my,&quot; &#039;<i>pony I&#039;m just renting a room from/roommate/best friend since foalhood/something more</i>,&#039; &quot;favorite pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t give me that &#039;favorite pony&#039; stuff. What kind of weird thing were you doing today?&quot; Bon-Bon and her earth pony strength easily dragged the heavy bag of apples into the kitchen, &quot;They&#039;re going to get sick and tired of all the candied apples and apple candies I&#039;m going to make for my shop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,...&quot; Lyra started.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s something related to your fascination with humans, isn&#039;t it?&quot; the earth pony mare preempted her, &quot;Something that requires you to sit in your weird way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I sit this way because,&quot; &#039;<i>I like to emulate how humans sit/a reminder of when I was a seapony/It&#039;s required posture to play the lyre/I&#039;m triple jointed/I seem to have forgotten how to pony/It&#039;s comfortable for me</i>,&#039; Lyra chose the safest answer, &quot;it&#039;s comfortable, at least for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh. Right,&quot; Bon-Bon scoffed, &quot;Look, Lyra. I&#039;ve known you since we were both foals living next door to each other in Canterlot. I know by now when you&#039;re hiding something important.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. I trust you Bon-Bon,&quot; Lyra let out a sigh, &quot;This is what happened. Are you familiar with multiple universe theory?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The one that states that there are an infinite number of universes, each slightly different from the last?&quot;</p><p class="double">The green unicorn stared at her friend in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;What? I&#039;ve lived with you for how long? I know far too much about every wild theory and speculation by now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra composed herself, &quot;Right. Well I tried to prove that theory a while ago using a mirror, a ninja suit, and a techno-magical contraption.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon-Bon nodded slowly with some hesitation. The only indication of emotion was a small twitch in her left eye, &quot;Go on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I kind of did something wrong and almost broke it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The mirror?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The multiverse.&quot;</p><p class="double">That eye twitch again, &quot;I see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now... imagine that each universe rests on a flat plane, like a tabletop. There are other universes that sit above and below them. Kind of like when you look into a fun house mirror and there&#039;s another mirror behind you and you wonder if you go far enough though all those other Lyras, you&#039;ll find one that is..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I get it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ever since my experiment, those tabletops have turned into clear window panes,&quot; Lyra&#039;s eyes slowly started to tear up, &quot;You&#039;d think I&#039;d be happy to see all the various different worlds, but they&#039;re becoming all jumbled up in my memories. I have to try and focus really hard each day just to figure out which Lyra I am.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That sounds.. horrible. Is there anything else?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra sniffled and wiped away her tears, &quot;There&#039;s also the matter of a time loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon-Bon took a deep breath, &quot;Where the same length of time occurs over and over? How long, and is it happening just to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Several years, usually - although, some loops happen outside Equestria. There are a couple dozen ponies who loop, usually not all at once.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s why you&#039;ve been spending time with Vinyl Scratch?&quot;</p><p class="double">The musical unicorn nodded, &quot;She&#039;s interested in music and has also recently started experiencing the same time period over and over. She, also, has some pony she cares about who isn&#039;t looping. We talk. Try and compare experiences.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon-Bon let out a long breath and then walked up to Lyra and gave her a big hug.</p><p class="double">When it was over, the green unicorn sat there on the couch, shocked, &quot;You? You believe me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. Yes, I do. You can peer into other worlds while time looping. It&#039;s sounds insane and crazy, but I&#039;d know if you were lying. And I do trust you, Lyra. That&#039;s why I didn&#039;t act when I saw you sneak away to Vinyl&#039;s house. Or Twilight&#039;s.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, Twilight has been helping me with my memory problem and teaching me magic. Oh, I can finally show you what a human looks like! Watch this!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s such a good..&quot; Bon-Bon started to say, but it was already to late. Lyra&#039;s horn started glowing first, followed by the rest of her body.</p><p class="double">Lyra concentrated on her spell matrix. It should be fairly simple to turn herself into a human &#039;<i>seapony/changeling/robot</i>&#039;. Her memories popped in at the last moment, disrupting the spell.</p><p class="double">The glow faded and Bon-Bon just stared, her eye twitching rapidly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, that didn&#039;t work out as well as I&#039;d hoped,&quot; Lyra said, cautiously examining her curled seapony tail with her mechanical arms. The ragged changeling wings buzzed on her back as her pony ears twitched in agitated frustration, &quot;I got the torso and most of the head correct. I still have my horn, so it would be no problem to try again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; Bon-Bon coughed, &quot;I mean, you might make things worse. I don&#039;t see how, but I&#039;m pretty sure you could do it. Instead, you are going to float yourself over to the bathroom and fill up the tub. Under no circumstances are you to try that spell again. I am going to slowly leave my house and fetch Twilight Sparkle. This is what&#039;s going to happen.&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony nodded to herself, her eye still twitching. Then she steadily trotted over to her front door, opened it, and walked out right into a stunned Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, excuse me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, no problem. Ah just wanted to come over and apologize for my little sister, and what was that strange critter on your couch?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is Lyra. She is a perfectly normal unicorn pony. That is all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bon-Bon!&quot; came Lyra&#039;s voice from inside the house, &quot;I bent one of my wings and I&#039;m not sure if I should get tub water on my robot parts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A perfectly normal unicorn pony.&quot; Bon-Bon rubbed at her eye, &quot;Now I have to see Twilight Sparkle on a totally unrelated matter.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You do realize that I&#039;m the element of honesty, don&#039;t ya?&quot; the farm pony asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then tell me if I&#039;m being honest when I say that at this point, I don&#039;t really care.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;How ya doing there, sugarcube?&quot; Applejack stood in the open doorway looking at the troubled unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m... doing. Come on in,&quot; Lyra, her eyes bleary and her mane disheveled, walked to one side and let in the cowpony, &quot;So what brings you by, Applejack?&quot; &#039;<i>Jaquiline/Jackie/Applesmith</i>.&#039;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shook her head, regulated her breathing, and tried to clear her thoughts.</p><p class="double">&quot;You, actually,&quot; Applejack walked inside and sat down on the living room couch, in the normal pony way, &quot;I&#039;ve heard you&#039;ve been having a touch bit of trouble, lately. I just though I&#039;d come over to see if there&#039;s anything I can do for ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I really appreciate it, Applejack, but I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s anything you can do about my problem,&quot; Lyra looked at her guest and saw all the various incarnations of Applejack at the same time. Fortunately, there wasn&#039;t as many as most of the other ponies, so her ever-present headache did not get any worse. Still, there was something she saw in the farmpony&#039;s history, &quot;Plus, what about your.. phobia?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The seapony thing? This is more important, sugarcube, than the perfectly rational fears of a silly pony.&quot; Applejack scoffed, then stated, &quot;Plus it has been getting better ever since Twilight stuffed me into your house while you were a seapony and locked the doors. And windows. And chimney. And reinforced the walls. But that&#039;s all water under the bridge. I&#039;m here to talk about your problem, not mine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra sat down on the couch in her usual way, and looked down at the cushions. A few moments passed this way in perfect silence.</p><p class="double">Applejack took in a deep breath, &quot;It&#039;s because they remind me of my little sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Lyra turned around at the unexpected sentence.</p><p class="double">The orange farm pony continued, &quot;Seaponies remind me of Apple Bloom. They all seem to have the same.. enthusiasm as she does. As Pinkie Pie does. As you do. And all I can imagine when I see them is Apple Bloom; with her reckless energy, but with a propensity for explosives that borders on Trixie levels. I can picture my barn exploding, and then our farm house exploding, and then the locked shed with Mac&#039;s secret doll collection exploding; and then Apple Bloom, a wild look in her eyes, coming out of a grove of burning, shattered apple trees announcing that she finally got her cutie mark in pointless gratuitous detonations and all she had to do was use the orchard for target practice.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;R.. Really?&quot; Lyra asked.</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded, &quot;I&#039;m a pretty steadfast pony. If the loops have done anything, they&#039;ve made me more like myself - if that makes any sense. I&#039;ve just become more Applejack-y as time goes on. And I&#039;ve always been a cautious sort. But you, Pinkie Pie, and Apple Bloom tend to jump into things with all hooves forward, full steam ahead, regardless of consequences. So when I found an entire race of ponies who lived by that philosophy; I admit, I got scared.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An entire race of Apple Blooms? That&#039;s actually understandable,&quot; the mint green unicorn nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Like I said, a perfectly rational fear. And like I also said; I&#039;m here, today, for you. If you need me to listen, I&#039;ll listen. If you need me to just sit here in the quiet evening, I&#039;ll gladly do that. I may not be as good a mind shrink as Fluttershy, or even Pinkie; but I just want you to know that if you need a pony at your back, you&#039;ve got me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks. Thank you, Applejack,&quot; Lyra sniffled and wiped the tears from her eyes. The two ponies then sat there in silence. Then, the green unicorn broke it, &quot;Do you want to hear me playing my lyre? I know enough to make the kind of music you like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m thinking I&#039;d like that,&quot; Applejack nodded, &quot;Just let me know if you need banjo accompaniment. It&#039;s still the instrument I&#039;m best at.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think, I think I would like that as well,&quot; and for the first time that day, Lyra smiled. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>94.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The request was the first hint, one that completely flew over her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Twilight. Listen, I&#039;ve got plans for this loop, but it&#039;ll be difficult to set everything up. Could you try to get a different DJ for the fashion show, Fiddlesticks maybe?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure thing, Vinyl. Heck, might be an excuse to get Sweetie to bond with Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awesome. So I&#039;ve gotta go, I won&#039;t be able to chat for a while...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do your thing, Vinyl, it&#039;ll be fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">The second hint, of course, had been the conspicuous absence of one DJ PON-3 in the papers, but Twilight had dismissed that as just a side effect of Vinyl&#039;s plans... whatever they were.</p><p class="double">The third hint was the rise of DJ LU5T, and that <i>would</i> have caught Twilight&#039;s attention if she hadn&#039;t been more focused on prepping for Discord. Simply put, though, she didn&#039;t go to night clubs often enough to realize the discrepancy, simply rationalizing that musicians were filling the void left by Vinyl.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t until she noticed the shield--or rather, the absence of the shield around Canterlot that Twilight started to suspect that maybe something more than a simple prank was ahoof. This suspicion was only confirmed once she arrived, finding no threat filed and Cadance performing the Ladybug dance easily. After congratulating her and Shining, she&#039;d excused herself to wander Canterlot.</p><p class="double">The final nail in the coffin came when she actually met DJ LU5T, a grinning white unicorn... with a silky green mane, whose real name was Crystal Wish. She&#039;d introduced herself, sending a codephrase and getting no reply; Crystal had been happy Pinkie hired her for the wedding, noting that &quot;Tavi is so jealous!&quot; among other things.</p><p class="double">Ah.</p><p class="double">So it was that on the morn of the wedding day, with no small amount of trepidation, that Twilight Sparkle looked out upon Canterlot in the vain hope she could prepare herself for whatever would happen next....</p><p class="double">&quot;WAZZUP IN THIS CITAAAAAAAAAAAY!&quot;</p><p class="double">And all of the sudden, a swarm of black creatures burst out of buildings, performing an amazingly coordinated dance number as they swung their glowsticks. Strolling through the crowd, wearing saggy pants and a backwards ball cap, was Queen Venation. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>94.9(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I hereby call the gathering to order!&quot; Sweetie cried, slamming a hoof on the podium. &quot;Our mission is simple: Prevent Celestia from having a single slice of cake this loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">Gasps of shock and horror came from her audience. &quot;Sweetie Belle, that... that&#039;s suicide!&quot; Nyx protested. &quot;Even when she&#039;s not awake, Celestia is dangerously protective of her pastries!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Suicide it may be, but there is a reason for this madness. And the reason is... Vengeance!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Vengeance?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re just bored and want to be a supervillain,&quot; Chrysalis deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Potayto, potahto. Anywho, I have enlisted you two as my trusted EEEEEEEEVIIIIIL LIEUTENANTS! Chrysalis, you and the changeling swarm will infiltrate the castle and intercept any and all cake deliveries! Nyx, with Luna&#039;s powers of dreamwalking you will prevent Celestia from even eating in her sleep. It&#039;s foolproof!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;IT&#039;S MADNESS!&quot; Nyx insisted.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s foolproof madness,&quot; Chrysalis countered. &quot;Right, I&#039;m in. Should be an interesting challenge.&quot; </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p><hr></p><p>94.10 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Rarity paused before hoofing over a swatch of her fabric to her old acquaintance, Suri Polomare. Why did she feel like she&#039;d done this before? Oh, no matter. It wasn&#039;t like anything bad would happen, right?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Why had she thought nothing bad would happen?! Suri had replicated her entire line! With her own specially made fabric! This was the WORST! POSSIBLE! THING!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity blinked from the stage as she realized just what she&#039;d done. She&#039;d let her talent for making fabulous dresswear supersede her friends! This was... This wasn&#039;t the worst possible thing. No, this was much too low to be that pleasant. She...</p><p class="double">A flash of rainbow light lit her eyes. Yes. She knew what she had to do.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity stared at the spool of rainbow-colored thread in a daze. That had all somehow worked out perfectly. Rather improbably perfect at that. So why did a once-in-a-lifetime series of events seem so familiar?</p><p class="double">And then it hit her. This all had happened before. She was repeating her life over and over again and... Oh, she was Awake now. How bizarre this was. Usually she Awoke and had to wait for her Loop memories to hit, not trudge on half-Asleep or whatever had happened and wait for her awareness of previous Loops to kick in. And not only was this rather late in the Loop, Twilight didn&#039;t seem to be Awake this time. Either there was a stealth Anchor or...</p><p class="double">She looked at the spool of rainbow-colored thread right at the moment it shimmered with rainbow light.</p><p class="double">Oh. Oh, my.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dash looked as the Wonderbolt pin she&#039;d gotten from Spitfire, wondering why all of this seemed so familiar. Why it seemed she&#039;d struggled between her loyalty to her friends and her desire to be the best stunt flyer ever before. And then it hit her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoah, that&#039;s kind of trippy,&quot; she shook her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Isn&#039;t it though, darling?&quot; Rarity said from behind her. &quot;Finally Awake I see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. You do the whole &#039;I&#039;m sort of Awake but not quite&#039; thing too?&quot; Rainbow asked her fashion-forward friend. &quot;And why are we Awake so late this time.</p><p class="double">At this, Rarity gleefully pointed at Rainbow&#039;s Wonderbolt pin, causing Dash to look at it just as it shimmered with rainbow light.</p><p class="double">&quot;No... No way...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my gosh! This has been the greatest revelation ever!&quot; Pinkie cheered as she heard how Cheese Sandwich had been inspired to become a party pony by <i>herself</i>. And that he wanted to throw this epic birth-aversary party <i>with</i> her! It was <i>so</i> much better than trying to beat him at partying and making her friend sad as a result. &quot;It&#039;s so great I&#039;m having deja vu about how great it is!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and then he gave me his rubber chicken to say thanks and whoah did you two Wake Up like this? It&#039;s like I&#039;m baseline Pinkie getting the looping memories instead of looping Pinkie getting my earlier memories!&quot; Pinkie chattered to a grinning Rarity and Rainbow Dash. &quot;Any idea what&#039;s going on? Is it super cool?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Check the chicken Pinkie,&quot; Dash&#039;s grin widened. Pinkie did so and saw it shimmer with rainbow light.</p><p class="double">&quot;ARE YOU SERIOUS?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy wanted to kick herself for being so foolish as Seabreeze hoofed her a flower from his homeland. Why did she think that pampering the breezies was being kind? Or even really taking care of them? It was selfish is what it was. Just as selfish now as when she&#039;d done it the first time and... Oh. Well, never let it be said that a lesson learned twice wasn&#039;t still a valuable one.</p><p class="double">&quot;You just finish Waking up?&quot; Dash whispered to her as they flew out.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded as they floated out and, as Twilight reversed the spell and turned them back to normal, she conveyed a wordless question to her foalhood friend.</p><p class="double">In response, Dash tapped the flower in her mane, causing Fluttershy to remove it and take a close look. It shimmered with rainbow light.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes widened. Could it be...?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack flipped the bit Silver Shill had given her as her friends, minus Twilight, surrounded her. She&#039;d thought that she was taking care of her family by letting Granny Smith think the tonic worked, but in the end she&#039;d realized she was only hurting them by not being honest. Now if only she could figure out why it all seemed so familiar...</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, never let it be said that I can&#039;t earn an honest bit!&quot; she chuckled, and then winced as the memories hit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Awake, darling?&quot; Rarity sing-songed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gotta be,&quot; Dash smirked. &quot;It&#039;s the only time she realizes what a lame joke that is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, what in tarnation&#039;s goin&#039; on?&quot; Applejack demanded. &quot;Twi&#039;s obviously not Awake and this is pretty durn late in the Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Check your &#039;honest bit&#039;,&quot; Fluttershy grinned herself. Mostly because Pinkie was vibrating with so much excitement she wouldn&#039;t be intelligible.</p><p class="double">Applejack rolled her eyes, but did so. It shimmered with rainbow light.</p><p class="double">&quot;It does that in the baseline too, gals,&quot; Applejack began dismissively before an alternative occurred to her. &quot;Wait, did you all Wake Up right after...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Four nods answered her.</p><p class="double">&quot;With deja-vu right before...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Another series of nods.</p><p class="double">&quot;With the lesson attached to the event clear as crystal in yer head?&quot;</p><p class="double">More nods.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then... It&#039;s finally happenin&#039;, ain&#039;t it? And Twi&#039;s the only one left...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what we&#039;ve concluded, darling!&quot; Rarity grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Your time will come.&quot;</p><p class="double">The words of Celestia did little to reassure Twilight about her doubts. At least those weird feelings of deja vu she&#039;d been getting since shortly before arriving in Ponyville had finally stopped.</p><p class="double">Now if only she could figure out why her friends all seemed so excited. There didn&#039;t seem to be any reason for it...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord. Celestia had chosen Discord to deal with the threat of Tirek. Even as she despondently led her friends to the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters, Twilight just couldn&#039;t get that thought out of her head. Why not her, she was capable, smart, powerful, skilled, and... and why did she just get a flash of Tirek as some tyrannical living sun?</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head and tried to focus on something else.</p><p class="double">&quot;...but stil.. ..... .etting Discor. .... .are of this?&quot; she heard Rainbow Dash faintly behind her.</p><p class="double">&quot;.. ....se!&quot; Rarity whispered back. &quot;It&#039;s bas..... ........ ... .. ...cover ... ... for herself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Huh. Seemed like her friends at least were also having trouble accepting the decision.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight found herself agreeing with Applejack after Discord&#039;s little &#039;visit&#039;. He was more annoying reformed than not.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Discord does have a point,&quot; Fluttershy reminded them. &quot;What if there is something important in the box?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow at how her friends all perked up at the idea. Huh. &quot;Well, there&#039;s only one way to find out.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After many, many hours of reading the castle&#039;s extensive library, they were no closer to finding an answer.</p><p class="double">&quot;The answer&#039;s in one of these books,&quot; Twilight insisted to herself. &quot;I just kno–&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut off as her eyes landed on the journal she and her friends had been keeping. The one Discord had bookmarked.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;I wonder...&#039;</i> she thought as she levitated it to the table before her and opened it to one of the marked passages.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She&#039;d found it. Each of her friends had faced a trial where their talents or desires seemed to conflict with their Element of Harmony, but in the end, they&#039;d chosen to do the right thing regardless of how hard it was and in doing so helped somepony else do the right thing as well. And each of them had received a token of friendship from those they helped.</p><p class="double">The chest was connected to the Tree of Harmony. The tree was connected to the elements. The elements were connected to them. So, just maybe, those objects were connected to the keys needed to open the chest.</p><p class="double">Which had, somehow, brought them to the current situation of Pinkie trying to strangle a rubber chicken.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s going to work,&quot; Twilight deadpanned right before she had to duck a ballistic rubber chicken as it slipped out of Pinkie&#039;s grasp.</p><p class="double">It flew over her head and struck the chest square on one of the keyholes. There was a flash of light, a surge of magic, and suddenly the rubber chicken was a key. A key that floated over and fit perfectly in the lock.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Huh...&#039;</i> Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">A few moments later and the rest of the objects had been turned into keys, and each fit snugly into one of the locks. Leaving only one missing.</p><p class="double">Hers.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike had burped up the urgent message from canterlot while she was realizing that her lack of an Element dillemma meant the box couldn&#039;t be opened, and she&#039;d left with all haste.</p><p class="double">The news was bad. Discord had joined forces with Tirek. Tirek was stealing the magic of all three tribes now and with it the control of the world that the ponies enjoyed.</p><p class="double">And the princesses&#039; plan was to voluntarily give up their magic before Tirek could steal it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Wow,&#039;</i> Twilight thought as the magical transfer finished. This... she&#039;d never felt like this... had she? She felt like she could do anything. Anything at...</p><p class="double">One look at the three magicless alicorns killed that thought. Their tired eyes. Their complete lack of cutie marks. Her promise to keep all of this a secret, even from her friends.</p><p class="double">She had never felt this helpless.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She needed more control. Her attempt to raise the sun resembled Celestia after a bender. And why did she know what that was like?</p><p class="double">Anyway, she needed to practice controlling this new magic. And she had to do it without the help of her friends, no matter how eager they seemed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Are we really gonna let her go off like that?&quot; Applejack asked the others. &quot;She&#039;s sparkin&#039; like a bug zapper in a mosquito swarm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, she clearly needs our help,&quot; Dash agreed as Pinkie nodded so furiously she almost lifted off the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;We agreed to leave this to baseline until Twilight&#039;s trial came to pass and she Awoke,&quot; Rarity reminded them. &quot;We know she&#039;s keeping a secret, darlings, but Tirek or no, I&#039;m <i>certain</i> this is part of her Element trial. Like we all did, she has to find her way herself.&quot;</p><p class="double">(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;So Tirek is draining magic, huh?&quot; Applejack changed the subject. &quot;And if&#039;n we&#039;re really doin&#039; tha baseline thing, we&#039;re probably gonna have to let &#039;im. How do we handle this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooo! Ooo!&quot; Pinkie bounced up, passing out strange devices. &quot;I made these a while back with Discord and Twilight. They&#039;d force our magic down to ordinary levels by temporarily containing excess energy in our subspace pockets.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity took hers with trepidation. &quot;...why, exactly, did you not mention these before?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Twilight tested one. It works, but she said she felt constantly tired while it was on.&quot; Pinkie shrugged. &quot;She thought it was a wash, since they only work when willingly activated.&quot;</p><p class="double">The five of them glanced between themselves.</p><p class="double">&quot;...For Twilight,&quot; Rainbow finally declared, activating hers. &quot;...ooooooog, wow. Yeah. Woo. I&#039;m alright, just a bit woozy...&quot;</p><p class="double">(Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy stared at what she saw happen. Discord, Unawake or not, had turned on them. Tirek had forcibly taken their magic before they managed to break free. And then he&#039;d betrayed Discord as well.</p><p class="double">The draconequus was even now staring in shock at the necklace Tirek had given him. What he&#039;d thought a symbol of allegiance merely a token of inevitable betrayal.</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess...&quot; she sniffed, feeling both hurt and weaker than she&#039;d ever felt. &quot;It really <i>is</i> all up to Twilight now.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as her uncontrolled flight plowed her right into a hoof bigger than she was. Tirek&#039;s hoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re going to give me what I want!&quot; he bellowed at her.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Not likely!&#039;</i> she thought as she teleported away.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the ruins of the Oaks and Branches library. Her home.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;That&#039;s it,&#039;</i> she thought as Owlowicious, whom she&#039;d barely rescued, flew off. <i>&#039;No more miss nice mare!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">A teleport later and she was unleashing a blast at Tirek whose radius was wider than her own body. And after he blocked it, growing twice as wide as Tirek himself. The mystery of why she wanted to yell &#039;kamehameha&#039; would have to wait.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight breathed heavily. She and Tirek seemed evenly matched, but this was her talent. She could win.</p><p class="double">&quot;It appears we&#039;re at an impasse,&quot; Tirek declared. &quot;So how about a trade?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gasped as her friends, plus Discord, appeared trapped in bubbles over Tirek&#039;s head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your friends for all the alicorn magic in Equestria!&quot;</p><p class="double">It was an impossible decision. Her friends or her magic. What was she without her friends? What was she without her magic?</p><p class="double">Her friends were pleading with her not to do it. After all, if she did, then Tirek would have control over the entire world. All races, pony and not, would be subject to his tyranny. But, to give up her friends even then...</p><p class="double">&quot;Enough!&quot; Tirek bellowed. &quot;I want an answer and I want it now!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at each of her friends in turn, and then a flash of rainbow light lit her eyes. She knew what she had to do. Really, there had never been another choice.</p><p class="double">&quot;I will give you my magic,&quot; she declared resolutely. &quot;In exchange for my friends.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">They all rushed to Twilight&#039;s side as Tirek grew to mountainous proportions. Even Discord, who she&#039;d demanded freed despite his betrayal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship,&quot; Discord offered sadly. &quot;But there is nothing worth more. I see that now.&quot;</p><p class="double">He fingered the necklace Tirek had given him.</p><p class="double">&quot;He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty,&quot; the powerless spirit of chaos lamented and began to remove the trinket. &quot;But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that, he placed it around the equally powerless Twilight&#039;s neck.</p><p class="double">It was a sweet gesture, they all admitted to themselves. Even if Equestria was still doomed.</p><p class="double">And then the familiar shimmer of rainbow light flashed across its surface.</p><p class="double">&quot;You think...?&quot; Applejack dared to hope.</p><p class="double">&quot;Only one way to know,&quot; Twilight told them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As she watched the medallion complete its transformation into a key, Twilight felt a sense of giddy anticipation she couldn&#039;t entirely put her hoof on.</p><p class="double">As she bid all of her friends to join her and turn their keys as one, she finished Waking Up. Her memories of past Loops leading up to this moment became clear as she watched the Harmony Chest open at long, long last.</p><p class="double">The rainbow that emerged hit the tree, causing the Element gems to glow brightly and then all six of them were engulfed in pillars of light. They were pulled into the chest and emerged transformed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a bad way to Wake Up,&quot; she smiled. They hadn&#039;t gotten the Elements back. Not exactly. It was more like they <i>were</i> the Elements. More now than they had ever been even in the Loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;So nice of you to join us, darling,&quot; Rarity smiled back. &quot;Shall we?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s,&quot; Twilight smirked. It was time to teach Tirek a lesson.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tirek went down with hardly a fight, and the harmonic wave resulting restored all of his stolen magic. But it didn&#039;t end there. The chest was rocketed to Ponyville where it planted itself and grew into a great shimmering tree-palace with them being transported before it.</p><p class="double">Then, and only then, did their transformations end.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweet maple!&quot; Rarity exclaimed as they all stared. &quot;Is that... <i>yours</i>, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I believe it is,&quot; the voice of Celestia declared from behind them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had to admit, a new home with thrones for each of her friends arranged in a circle, a stronger bond than ever to the Elements and each other. Plus one heck of a heartsong and accompanying celebration.</p><p class="double">That had been worth the wait.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Right!&quot; Twilight grinned. &quot;First order of business, RESEARCH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Her friends all giggled.</p><p class="double">&quot;...No, I&#039;m serious, I want to be able to do that on command.&quot; The alicorn waved. &quot;The rainbowy transformation thing. Which means we need to figure out the exact trigger.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Pinkie mused, &quot;I don&#039;t think any of us are ever going to be able to do it solo. It felt like a group thing...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And there&#039;s tha fact that it was locked in the box,&quot; Applejack pointed out. &quot;Actually, the box is in tha ground, can we get to tha keys?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, the keys were all ordinary items before,&quot; Fluttershy mused. &quot;Maybe we can just get those items again and keep them in our Pockets...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe the keys are part of the palace now,&quot; Rainbow suggested. &quot;Like... the skeleton, or different sections?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever the case, opening the box early is going to be a priority in this whole effort,&quot; Rarity said definitively. &quot;Otherwise, we&#039;d have only a week at a time!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked evilly. &quot;Mwahahahaha! I HAVE TURNED YOU ALL INTO EGGHEADS!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NOOOOOOO!&quot; cried Rainbow.... and then they all cracked up again. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>(This loop was essentially entirely the brainchild of Crisis. As it&#039;s ridiculously long, I&#039;ve not got the time to proof read it. As such, things in this loop should not necessarily be taken as canon-OK. Sorry.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">My Mega Pony</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke this loop in the middle of the familiar library tower, reading a book she was actually unfamiliar with. She decided to take a moment to review her memories to figure out just why she was reading it in the first place.</p><p class="double">&quot;Geez, Twilight,&quot; Spike&#039;s voice cut into her thoughts. &quot;What&#039;s got you so excited?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The princess assigned me to oversee preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration!&quot; Twilight heard herself exclaiming with very uncharacteristic eagerness in her voice. She&#039;d originally been annoyed at the assignment because of focusing on the return of Nightmare Moon, and while it had become a higher point since then, it was fairly routine due to the Loops. &quot;<i>In Ponyville!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Spike said suspiciously. &quot;She does that almost every Loop. It&#039;s more exciting when that&#039;s <i>not</i> what happens, remember?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Okay, looping Spike confirmed,&#039;</i> Twilight thought to herself as her mouth took over again.</p><p class="double">&quot;But Spike,&quot; she heard herself say on autopilot, like this was a familiar rant for this version of her, &quot;it&#039;s <i>Ponyville</i>! The home of <i>Light Labs</i>! The most advanced and innovative technomagical research and development company in the history of <i>ever</i>!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Dear Tree,&#039; </i>Twilight thought in dismay as she found her mouth was fully on Loop memory autopilot and she couldn&#039;t stop it, <i>&#039;I&#039;m a fanfilly.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot; Spike said intelligently. Twilight could sympathize. This was rather out of left field.</p><p class="double">&quot;Founded by the earth pony genius Dr. Light and his partner Dr. Wily, Light Labs is at least a thousand years ahead of anyone else in the field of technomagical development. The two doctors&#039; discoveries on how earth pony magic can be channelled through solid mediums such as crystals and metals revolutionized magical studies around the world, but they weren&#039;t satisfied with that! They went on to show how one race&#039;s magic could be converted into another&#039;s through controlled processes, not only allowing earth ponies and pegasi to power unicorn devices, but they&#039;ve broken the monopoly that pegasi have had on large scale weather manipulation and earth ponies have possessed on quality produce since the time of the founders! They&#039;ve even made fully autonomous mechanical robots for commercial and industrial usage that further revolutionized Equestria&#039;s economy! And they&#039;re all set to unveil their latest inventions the day after the Summer Sun Celebration! I&#039;ll be able to get front row seats! And maybe they can autograph my cloud boots! *SQUEEEEEEEEE!*&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Holy chlorophyll,&#039;</i> Twilight thought as she lined up the involuntary rant with her now-examined memories for this loop, <i>&#039;two </i>Unawake <i>earth ponies did all that in what seems like an Equestria baseline? Fanfilly tendencies have been justified.&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Checking in on the preparations for the summer sun celebration had gone smoothly. Of the usual Elements only Dash wasn&#039;t Awake this time. A teen Spike had stayed with Rarity to absolutely no shock and overall, no real surprises had occurred save that Fluttershy had decided that she was going to be singing along with her bird choir. The yellow pegasus may have become more confident over the course of the Loops, but what amounted to a solo public performance, even knowing it would likely be interrupted by Nightmare Moon, was a big step for her.</p><p class="double">And now she finally had some free time to check out this &quot;Light Labs&quot; place. Such an establishment most likely meant new loopers visiting for a fused Loop, but there was always the slim chance the Loop was just a particularly esoteric variant of Equestria. Those did happen from time to time.</p><p class="double">But in any case, she&#039;d get to meet the brilliant minds behind all of those inventions she recalled from her Loop memories, talk with them, exchange ideas. She was so excited she...</p><p class="double">...Was apparently doing the happy hoofy dance in the middle of the street. Pine, but these fanfilly tendencies she&#039;d gotten for the Loop were deeply ingrained.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, hello there. Who might you two be?&quot; Twilight greeted the two fillies, well one filly and one robot in the form of a filly, that had answered the lab&#039;s door. She knew the first to be Scootaloo and the second looked surprisingly like Silver Spoon, but she had to play ignorant just in case they weren&#039;t Awake.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Scootaloo Light,&quot; the orange pegasus filly beamed, &quot;and this is my friend Silver Spoon! We both Awoke real early this morning miss...?&quot; (#1#)</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle,&quot; the so-named unicorn beamed back, catching the subtle inflection signaling that the two were Awake. &quot;How has the L–&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut herself off with a cough when Scootaloo and Silver made the &#039;not here&#039; signal. Right. Explaining might be awkward if the wrong person overheard.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized. &quot;How is life at the lab? I imagine it&#039;s very exciting! Do you ever have any other friends over?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah,&quot; Scootaloo answered, letting her know that it was just the orange pegasus and Silver of the expanded CMC that were Awake, &quot;not many are too interested in this kind of stuff so my adopted family and I don&#039;t get many visitors. Though I&#039;ve got the coolest older brother and sister by 100%!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. Only 20% lower than looping Rainbow Dash. High praise from Scootaloo indeed. &quot;Well, do you think anyone would mind if I came in and met the doctors?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not at all!&quot; Scootaloo chirped. &quot;Well, uncle Wily might be a little irate, but that&#039;s because he&#039;s really protective of the stuff he and dad invent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Silver added, &quot;he takes a little getting used to.&quot; (2)</p><p class="double">&quot;I promise not to steal anything,&quot; Twilight made the Pinkie Promise gestures as the two led her inside. <i>&#039;Apple Bloom will never forgive me if I don&#039;t get her in here somehow,&#039;</i> Twilight found herself thinking. Even if Apple Bloom wasn&#039;t Awake this time, the looping version would never let Twilight live it down if she didn&#039;t find some way to get her inside Light Labs. &quot;I just want to meet the two most brilliant stallions in all Equestria!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fanfilly much?&quot; Silver arched a mechanical eyebrow as the purple mare #squealed with glee#.</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought I had that under control,&quot; Twilight blushed as Scootaloo snickered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As it turned out, she got the full tour. Dr. Wily was somewhat abrasive, but some liberal compliments of his intelligence and a bit of buttering up brought him around rather quickly. Dr. Light, by comparison, seemed embarrassed by such attention but was very enthusiastic about sharing his love for science and invention. Neither of them seemed like they were trying to reconcile any memories that conflicted with their lives in Equestria.</p><p class="double">Along the tour, she&#039;d met Dr. Light&#039;s twin children, his son Rock and his daughter Roll, who were two of the friendliest ponies she&#039;d ever met. Though for some reason Scootaloo and Silver snickered when she told them this and even the twin earth ponies had given her an amused look.</p><p class="double">Towards the end, she even got a sneak preview of the doctors latest inventions. A series of six cutting edge industrial robots with personalities programmed to be so close to a real pony that they could react and make decisions like one, in addition to being able to issue commands to lesser industrial robots to facilitate a more efficient work environment. It looked to be the start of a technological revolution the likes of which Equestria usually didn&#039;t see outside the discovery of an alien spacecraft, and as she bid her hosts farewell she was excited to see what direction it would go in.</p><p class="double">The whole thing was causing her memory to tickle a little bit too, which probably meant this was a fused Loop after all. But she&#039;d perused so much of the Hub&#039;s fiction that it was #hard to place a new Loop setting immediately#, especially if it deviated significantly. Like, say, being dropped in Equestria. Plus she had a backlog of fiction she <i>still</i> hadn&#039;t gotten around to reading even after all this time. The Hub had a <i>lot</i> of published works after all.</p><p class="double">Even so, she probably could have identified the visitors in a few moments using the search engine she’d developed to sift through the vast Hub media she had digitally stored. However, she found she was enjoying the feeling of newness and the challenge of figuring it out for herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Twilight?&quot; Scootaloo caught up with her a short ways off from the lab. &quot;My brother and sister this Loop wanted me to tell you to meet them later. I told them you&#039;d probably be at the library, so they said they&#039;d meet you there after Pinkie&#039;s party.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks Scootaloo,&quot; Twilight smiled. So, the Light siblings were the visiting loopers? She looked forward to meeting them properly then.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s typical welcome party was in full swing. Twilight had been mildly surprised that it wasn&#039;t a &#039;welcome new loopers&#039; party as well, but she hadn&#039;t brought it up in case she set the party pony off and ended up with Ponyville buried in confetti or something stranger. (3) Currently she was talking with Rainbow Dash when something the other mare said caught her attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Twilight&#039;s found herself interrupting what the current variation of Rainbow Dash had said to her, &quot;<i>you&#039;re</i> the &#039;subject&#039; who volunteered for the <i>&#039;Rainbooms: The Nature and Capabilities of Pegasus Magic&#039;</i> study?! Ohmygosh! It&#039;s so great to meet you! Can I get your auto–*ahem*&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed furiously as the Unawake version of her friend began laughing her head off. <i>&#039;Tree damn this Loop and the fanfilly tendencies that come with it!&#039;</i> she yelled mentally. She idly wondered if her natural tendency to get excited over intellectual pursuits was making it harder to resist the impulses that came with her Loop memories. It could be the nearness of the native personality variant to her baseline was making it harder to suppress, which would be an interesting study come to think of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized, &quot;I don&#039;t know what–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Forget it!&quot; Dash waved her off. &quot;The docs were about the only ponies who gave my claim of doing a Sonic Rainboom back then any credit at all, and they were nice enough to help me get set up in Ponyville when half of Cloudsdale blamed me when the docs broke the weather monopoly. For eggheads, they&#039;re really cool, and it&#039;s great to know somepony actually appreciates what we did together. Besides, Scoots told me that you were a little excitable over that kind of stuff.&quot; (4)</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll bet she did,&quot; Twilight blushed again. &quot;Say, do you know about the pegasus harmpph?&quot;</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been about to say &#039;harness&#039; when Dash shoved her hoof into Twilight&#039;s mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shhh!&quot; the rainbow-maned pegasus hushed her and glanced around the party to see who&#039;d overheard before removing her hoof and continuing in a whisper. &quot;That&#039;s supposed to be a secret! Scoots told me you&#039;d gotten the special tour, but that project&#039;s hush-hush! And, yeah, I know about it. I&#039;m the one they&#039;re testing it against. Rock, and sometimes Roll, strap the thing on and pretty much try to keep up with me. It&#039;s not nearly ready, but when it is it&#039;s gonna make Cloud Boots obsolete.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow,&quot; she whispered back. &quot;They must be pretty brave ponies. Have they always been like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Dash blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, what were they like when they were younger?&quot; Twilight asked, fishing for some information on the visiting loopers before they met up after the party.# &quot;Did you go to school with them?&quot;#</p><p class="double">&quot;Did I go to–?&quot; Dash started before cracking up again.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Twilight inquired, thoroughly confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Oh</i>, no!&quot; Dash giggled. &quot;Not spoiling the surprise! Rock and Roll would be pissed if I did that! In fact, I should probably go grab Scoots before she slips up, later!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight twitched as the twin ponies laughed and refused to let her and her looping friends in on the surprise they had in store. It was after the party and Rock and Roll had joined her, Spike, and the other four Awake Elements for a quiet meet and greet. They were indeed loopers and they&#039;d already had the &#039;welcome to the multiverse&#039; speech so that sometimes awkward hurdle was cleared. The only hiccup was Pinkie having to be regularly restrained from turning it into a full-blown welcome party for the brother and sister pair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Twilight,&quot; Rock grinned as he tapped his boots on the floor. The earth pony stallion&#039;s blue metal boots matched his coat and his brown mane was, as Rarity might put it, &#039;stylishly unkempt&#039;. Topping off his appearance was a tool box cutie mark. &quot;But if you can&#039;t tell then we&#039;re not letting you know before dad gets a chance. He&#039;s been planning this for a while.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gah!&quot; Pinkie yelled suddenly. &quot;I can&#039;t take it! You&#039;ve gotta let me throw a &#039;welcome to Equestria&#039;s Loop&#039; party for you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But we already had one of your &#039;welcome to Ponyville&#039; parties,&quot; Roll, the cream-coated and yellow-maned earth pony mare with a cutie mark of a metal broom and red metallic slippers over her hooves, placated. &quot;And it was a lot of fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it&#039;s not the same! You weren&#039;t Awake for that one! None of us were!&quot; Pinkie insisted, pulling out a party petard and starting to arm it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not without the whole family,&quot; Rock insisted. Surprisingly, Pinkie stopped and sighed as she disarmed her party munitions.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Pinkie,&quot; Roll apologized, &quot;but we&#039;d like to have our brother here for that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, okay,&quot; the party pony moped for a moment before straightening. &quot;But I get to throw you a <i>huge</i> &#039;family getting back together&#039; party on top of it when that happens.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You have another brother?&quot; Twilight asked after the two had agreed to Pinkie&#039;s condition.</p><p class="double">&quot;Our older brother Blues,&quot; Roll nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s... estranged at the moment,&quot; Rock told them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Twilight blinked. &quot;How long has it been that way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Since our baseline,&quot; Roll informed them as her brother sighed. &quot;He&#039;s stubborn like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Equestrian loopers blinked as one.</p><p class="double">&quot;How...?&quot; Rarity started.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s complicated,&quot; Rock told them. &quot;And he&#039;s repeatedly asked we not say anything more on the subject.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Twilight decided to change the subject before the atmosphere got any more depressing, &quot;as you may or may not have heard, we like to consider ourselves a sanctuary Loop. We can handle all the native problems just fine, so you two can feel free to take a vacation and relax if you like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Rock hedged and Twilight realized that her offer had apparently not served to reduce tension. &quot;How enforceable is that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve had some pretty good success using the Elements of Harmony to keep the peace even when visiting loopers don&#039;t want to play nice,&quot; Twilight told them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Rarity chimed in. &quot;A nice time out on the Moon works wonders for troublemakers.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Rock shook his head, &quot;I mean...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What my brother&#039;s trying to say,&quot; Roll filled in, &quot;is if that&#039;s backed up by your Loop&#039;s nature or your local admin?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, no,&quot; Applejack looked confused. &quot;Why would it be?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Rock apologized, &quot;but our Loop is... well &#039;anti-sanctuary&#039; probably fits. You see, our Loops usually start out peacefully, just like this one, but no matter what we do to forestall it, a war happens.&quot;</p><p class="double">The room went silent for a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;We haven&#039;t been looping too long, but we&#039;ve tried a lot of things,&quot; Roll continued for him. &quot;The closest we&#039;ve come to succeeding was becoming villains ourselves, which ended up causing our normal villain to be the hero. Sometimes we join forces against a larger threat, but then it&#039;s back to business as usual with us on one side and him on the other. The one time that someone, not us mind you, killed him before he could start his bids for world conquest the situation ended up <i>worse</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, if you don&#039;t mind me asking, who–?&quot; Twilight cut her question off when the siblings shook their heads in unison.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not telling,&quot; Rock stated with finality. &quot;Just in case it doesn&#039;t happen this time. We don&#039;t want to end up tainting your opinion of him and inadvertently causing it anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">That... made a lot of sense actually.</p><p class="double">&quot;What we&#039;re getting at,&quot; Roll picked up, &quot;is that we&#039;re starting to think something about our Loop is setting things up so that conflict is inevitable. The initial cause has ranged from perceived slights, to well-intentioned extremism, to accidents that induce madness, to the individual in question having been secretly evil the whole time. Our Loop is pretty messed up on top of it too, with bugs, viruses, and a pretty corrupted baseline. So there&#039;s often no indication of which way events are going to go either. Some threats come and go between Loops, and every so often something bizarre crawls out of the variants.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And in every single one,&quot; Rock intoned gravely, &quot;at least one of us has had to fight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Spike interrupted. &quot;Which one of you is the Anchor again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... both of us, actually,&quot; Rock admitted sheepishly.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re Co-Anchors?&quot; Spike inquired.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Roll shook her head. &quot;We&#039;re not... &#039;soul-bonded&#039; or whatever Hephaestus – he&#039;s our admin – called it. He says we&#039;re &#039;Joint Anchors&#039;, or that we jointly share the position while not being otherwise connected. We understand it&#039;s not exactly common.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Goodness, no!&quot; Rarity twittered. &quot;Why, I&#039;ve never heard of such a thing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, the Crash from a while back musta hit yer place pretty hard, huh?&quot; Applejack contributed.</p><p class="double">#No one missed the double wince from the two visiting loopers when that was mentioned.#</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait...&quot; Twilight&#039;s face scrunched up as she thought before widening her eyes in revelation. &quot;You...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rock admitted heavily, &quot;our Loop is sort of responsible for what everyone calls &#039;The Crash&#039;. Lucky us, we got chained to front row seats for the event.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I...&quot; Twilight&#039;s mouth worked up and down in shock. Sure, she&#039;d expected to eventually meet whoever was from that Loop where trying to get it online caused the arguably worst event in the history of the Loops, but having them here in front of her...</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow, um...&quot; Spike wasn&#039;t having any better luck. After all, it couldn&#039;t have been their fault. Yggdrasil wouldn&#039;t start anyone looping who had a part in destroying an entire reality, so they were just as much victims as the Loop that was lost.</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s hair had started to go a bit straight as she teared up in response to the revelation and Fluttershy had somehow gotten even more quiet than usual as she sniffled silently.</p><p class="double">&quot;...gosh,&quot; Applejack tried and failed to offer something. What did you say in a situation like this? &quot;That&#039;s.....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My word,&quot; Rarity managed to recover first. &quot;And you witnessed the whole thing?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Wait a second,&#039;</i> Twilight&#039;s brain latched on to that particular tidbit as the siblings nodded in response to Rarity&#039;s question. &quot;You <i>remember</i> it?! You... You actually have memories of the Anchor who was lost?! Then you could...&quot;</p><p class="double">She trailed off at the dual shaking heads.</p><p class="double">&quot;All we remember about them,&quot; Rock told them, &quot;is a hole in space where a person should have been.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hephaestus told us recently that he&#039;s been examining our memories for any data that could aid the possible recovery of the branch they lost,&quot; Roll continued, &quot;but...&quot;</p><p class="double">The room got quiet again for a bit, and then Pinkie sprang up suddenly.</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; the pink party pony declared forcefully. &quot;No more moping on sad stuff we can&#039;t change! We have new friends to get to know, stories to tell, and games to play! Oh, and we have to get ready for Nightmare Moon showing up at what would otherwise be dawn to try and cast everything into eternal darkness. You know, business as usual.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rock and Roll blinked and looked at each other before turning back to the ponies and dragon.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you <i>sure</i> this sanctuary thing of yours works?&quot; they asked in unison.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s done pretty well so far,&quot; Fluttershy smiled serenely.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Save for Rock and Roll insisting on accompanying them for the adventure, the whole thing with Nightmare Moon had gone pretty darn close to baseline. In deference to giving their visiting loopers the &#039;Equestrian Experience&#039;, Spike had volunteered to sit out as an Element of Loyalty and allow the local Rainbow Dash variant to fill her usual role.</p><p class="double">The interactions between everyone had been rather enlightening. Their visitors clearly had Loop history with Unawake Rainbow Dash, and had asked her if she&#039;d heard from their older brother lately. Apparently Blues had been convinced to keep in touch with the daredevil pegasus even after his estrangement, and that managed to intrigue Applejack enough to get into a conversation with Dash about the mysterious member of the Light family. Roll had then gravitated to Rarity and Fluttershy and the three had gabbed away on the trek about animals, fashion, housekeeping tips, and medicine of all things. Rock had proved to be quite the intellectual, clearly taking after his father, and he and Twilight had gotten along like paper and ink. Interestingly, he also seemed to take to Pinkie Pie pretty well. He was far less random than the premier party pony, but Twilight could tell that like her hyperactive friend, Rock was somepony who genuinely desired to see everyone happy.</p><p class="double">Heck, Twilight had even felt some resonance between the two and some of the Elements as they were activated and bonded to her and her friends like in the baseline. It was something that might bear looking into at a later time.</p><p class="double">But for now they had a &#039;Welcome back&#039; party to attend for Luna. And she had a mysterious orb that had been formed when Luna was purified of Nightmare Moon that felt really darn familiar for some reason to examine later.</p><p class="double">&quot;What doth rocks and rolling have to do with music?&quot; an Unawake Luna asked of the twin earth ponies. Twilight had to marvel again at how quickly the two had gotten Luna down to a normal speaking volume.</p><p class="double">In reply, the two grinned and called out to a nearby Ponyville resident. &quot;Hey Vinyl! You got the karaoke machine hooked up yet? We need to introduce Princess Luna to our namesake!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All ready!&quot; the DJ in mirrored shades piped back, gesturing the two onto an impromptu stage.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is this... karaoke?&quot; Luna puzzled as the siblings began to sing.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Dad likes that old time rock and roll!</i></p><p class="double"><i>The kinda music just soothes the soul!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Doctor Bright Light, your majesty,&quot; the bearded labcoat-wearing earth pony inventor introduced himself to Princess Luna. &quot;And may I say you dance divinely.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We thank you, good sir,&quot; Luna blushed. She had no idea what had possessed her to get up on stage and dance beside this stallion&#039;s children. It was just... that music... It called to her.</p><p class="double">&quot;And this is my good friend and partner, Doctor Wily Plan,&quot; the white-maned earth pony introduced his frizzy gray-maned and mustachioed earth pony companion, also in a labcoat.</p><p class="double">&quot;A pleasure to meet you Princess!&quot; the other pony inventor gushed. &quot;May I say that I have always loved your night sky!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hail and well met!&quot; Luna greeted the scientist. &quot;It pleases us greatly to know how well ponies have taken to intellectual pursuits these days! We have heard tell of the many marvels you both have produced and we would like to hear more!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, if you don&#039;t mind staying until tomorrow,&quot; Dr. Light enticed, &quot;you can witness the unveiling of our latest inventions.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We would be honored, good sirs!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mares and gentlestallions,&quot; Dr. Light proclaimed from the podium as a curtain rose, (5) &quot;I present to you the latest invention from the minds at Light Labs, the robot masters!&quot;</p><p class="double">Upon the stage stood six robot ponies of various types.</p><p class="double">&quot;To oversee forestry management and logging excursions, DLN-003 Cut Mare!&quot;</p><p class="double">An orange and white earth pony model with a pair of scissors atop her head jumped off the stage and threw the scissors at an unwieldy log set aside for demonstration purposes. In moments the limbs had been sheared off and the log neatly quartered.</p><p class="double">&quot;I also do some mane-styling in my spare time,&quot; the robot winked at the impressed crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;For construction, particularly in hazardous conditions, DLN-004 Guts Stallion!&quot;</p><p class="double">A truly massive earth-pony model, standing a bit taller than even Celestia, lumbered down off the stage and picked up an I-Beam as easily as a normal pony might heft a baseball bat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Built strong to build strong!&quot; the robot rumbled in a deep baritone that complemented the crowd&#039;s applause.</p><p class="double">&quot;Built for arctic and cold climate exploration, DLN-005, Ice Mare!&quot;</p><p class="double">A short pegasus model in a stereotypical parka flew over not to the demonstration area, but to a table of refreshments holding so-far untouched cups of warm lemonade. She then blew a mist over the cups, turning them frosty in an instant.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m also built for cold storage capacity,&quot; she smiled as the refreshment table was suddenly swarmed.</p><p class="double">&quot;For demolitions and excavation, DLN-006, Bomb Stallion!&quot;</p><p class="double">A portly unicorn model bounded to the other side of the stage to a new demonstration area where a shack had been hastily constructed the other day. The robot then whooped as he conjured some explosives and tossed them into the shack. A moment later and all the walls and supports were blown out, leaving the fully intact roof to fall straight down.</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Applejack whispered to Twilight as the crowd applauded loudly at the display of precision control, &quot;ya think introducing him ta Trixie would be a good idea or a bad-un?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I <i>love</i> my job!&quot; the robot cheered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Bad,&quot; Twilight whispered back, &quot;definitely bad. Doesn&#039;t matter that she&#039;s not Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For waste management, DLN-007, Fire Mare!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, look, it&#039;s you when you&#039;re angry,&quot; Pinkie grinned at Twilight as the second unicorn model suddenly produced a flaming mane as she strode over to the second demonstration area. The female robot stared at the debris for a moment before rearing up and blasting flames from her forehooves that reduced the debris to ash.</p><p class="double">&quot;No muss,&quot; the robot drawled much like Applejack tended to as the reporters&#039; cameras flashed even faster, &quot;no fuss.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And finally, to rewrite the book on Equestria&#039;s growing need for power management, DLN-008, Elec Mare!&quot;</p><p class="double">The final pegasus model strode to the front of the stage and spread her wings. Arcs of lightning emanated from her and suddenly the perimeter of the stage was lit up with previously unnoticed lights like Hearth&#039;s Warming Eve.</p><p class="double">&quot;I knew you&#039;d get a charge out of me!&quot; the robot declared to enthusiastic cheers as a set of pyrotechnics went off along the stage&#039;s edge.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Rarity giggled demurely. &quot;It&#039;s a robot Rainbow Dash. How ever shall we cope?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Guess we&#039;ll have to practice ducking and covering,&quot; Spike shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you&#039;ll help me practice, won&#039;t you Spike?&quot; Rarity fluttered her eyelashes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Get a room you two,&quot; Twilight groused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pardon us, master Light,&quot; Luna spoke up from where she and her sister sat observing the unveiling, causing the crowd to quiet down. &quot;We know we have been gone from Equestria for a... long time, but surely ponies still begin their counting with the number &#039;one&#039;, do they not? Wereforth are the first two of your creations?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An excellent question your majesty,&quot; Dr. Light beamed, &quot;and one I&#039;m afraid I must let somepony else answer.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Dr. Light beckoned towards backstage, and his two children stepped out to stand before the now confused crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello everyone!&quot; Rock waved cheerfully. &quot;I&#039;m DLN-001, dad&#039;s tool-using lab assistant.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m DLN-002,&quot; Roll curtsied before the slack-jawed audience, &quot;housekeeper, and the one who makes sure this motley group of goofs takes proper care of themselves.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rock rubbed his mane sheepishly, &quot;she&#039;s good at that.&quot;</p><p class="double">#&quot;YOU&#039;RE ROBOTS?!&quot;# somepony yelled incredulously. <i>&#039;Huh. Well that explains a lot. They&#039;re certainly a lot more life-like in appearance than Silver ended up,&#039;</i> Twilight thought as she looked around for who had yelled. It took her a moment and seeing half the crowd looking straight at her to realize she&#039;d been the one who&#039;d yelled it. <i>&#039;I&#039;m going to need to put a leash on my subconscious this Loop, aren&#039;t I?&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;YES!&quot; a butter-yellow pegasus elated as she involuntarily rose into the air. Fluttershy suddenly realized what she&#039;d done and floated back down, blushing the whole way, but still clearly excited. &quot;I won the pot!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awww,&quot; Twilight heard Lyra pout nearby, &quot;I was sure they were humans in disguise!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; Rarity fanned herself dramatically, &quot;My money was on them being his illegitimate children by a summer love he met while on an exotic vacation!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I had mine on them having stayed with another member of the family until their dad got himself properly set up with his business here,&quot; Applejack sighed.</p><p class="double">Twilight spotted Rainbow Dash rolling on the ground and laughing as more and more ludicrous disproven theories about the origins of Dr. Light&#039;s children were passed around. At least she hadn’t been the only one fooled, even among her looping friends. Then again, none of them had exactly checked their magical signature or anything.</p><p class="double">&quot;Truly, your children are a marvel of ingenuity,&quot; Luna could be heard complementing the good doctor.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m just happy to have them in my life,&quot; Dr. Light smiled back while his son and daughter fielded a deluge of questions from the gathered reporters like pros.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Later after the unveiling, Twilight managed to track down Dr. Light and show him the strange orb that had been dropped when Luna was cleansed of Nightmare Moon. Dr. Wily had passed through earlier looking typically sour of him, but she and Dr. Light were too engrossed in studying the object to pay him any mind.</p><p class="double">&quot;My goodness, this is extraordinary,&quot; Dr. Light proclaimed fervently as he took readings. &quot;It&#039;s clearly a power source, but I can see mental patterns inherent in it as well!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean, that&#039;s a pony in there?&quot; Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Or some other sapient race,&quot; Dr. Light clarified. &quot;Perhaps even one we&#039;ve never encountered before. We&#039;d have to give it a body capable of communicating with us to know for sure. Would you like to learn how?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me? <i>You</i> want to show <i>me</i> how to build a robot like Rock and Roll?&quot; Twilight blinked, feeling her fanfilly tendencies rising and trying to stamp them out before they embarrassed her again.</p><p class="double">It was harder than it sounded. Especially since was starting to get an idea of why the orb had felt familiar, which meant her maternal instincts were backing up her fanfilly tendencies.</p><p class="double">&quot;I managed to help my adopted daughter build her friend Silver,&quot; the roboticist smiled, &quot;so it shouldn&#039;t be too difficult to teach somepony of your clear capability.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes!&quot; she cheered and began bouncing around the room. &quot;Yesyesyesyesyesyes!&quot;</p><p class="double">She was gonna have her daughter around for the Loop! Wheeee!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The positive atmosphere of the previous day seemed so far away now, Twilight mused. Ponyville wasn&#039;t feeling the effects directly, but they&#039;d gotten the news on the televised news broadcast the doctors&#039; technomagical advances had allowed to become widespread.</p><p class="double">The events they were showing were not heartening. For some unfathomable reason Dr. Wily had stolen the six robot masters and used them to commandeer robots in the techno-savvy city of Manehattan and hold the entire metropolitan area hostage. He was demanding... actually he was sounding a lot like Nightmare Moon come to think of it. Lots of jealousy, some legitimate, some sorely misplaced, and all blown <i>way</i> out of proportion.</p><p class="double">The princesses apparently had their hooves full trying to calm a panicking populace to give the situation their full attention and the guard had already been defeated trying to take the city back.# No fatalities yet, and Dr. Wily’s forces actually seemed to be taking care to incapacitate rather than kill. #Currently, Shining Armor was using his barrier spell to contain the hostile forces inside Manehattan, which was taking up all his concentration.</p><p class="double">And Dr. Light had just nixed the proposal to use the Elements of Harmony.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Elements might work on Dr. Wily, perhaps,&quot; the stallion lamented, &quot;but we have no idea if they will have any effect at all on robots. You would all be put in grave danger if they failed, and Wily would likely gain control of the Elements as a result, and #who knows what he could do with such artifacts in his madness#?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought back to the baseline incident with Sunset Shimmer and concluded that such a thing could be very bad indeed. She was debating ascending to take care of the problem when Rock and Roll stepped forward and determinedly asked to be converted into fighting robots. In deference to the fact that they clearly seemed to know what they were doing, Twilight decided to let them handle things for now. But if it became necessary, she would step in.</p><p class="double">Twilight and Dash were both tapped to help with the conversion while the rest of the looping Elements looked on silently, understanding that this was something their visitors did regularly and respecting their decision. The two armored figures stepped out of the final conversion capsules looking every inch the heroes they clearly were used to being.</p><p class="double">&quot;I built the two of you as Rock and Roll, after my love of music,&quot; Dr. Light smiled sadly as he looked upon the results of his efforts, &quot;you are something very different now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You said the hoof-cannons you gave us are called &#039;Mega Busters&#039;, right?&quot; Rock asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well then you can call us Mega Stallion and Mega Mare!&quot; Roll finished.</p><p class="double">#</p><p class="double">Twilight felt like facehooving at the ponified title of a popular video game series from the Hub. <i>That&#039;s</i> why their names sounded familiar!#</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony, My Mega Pony,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ahh ahh ahh ahhh ahhhhhhhh~~~</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I used to wonder what robots could mean,</i></p><p class="double"><i>To a world that&#039;s all so serene.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Hooves of Iron.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Tails of Steel.</i></p><p class="double"><i>But with a heart that&#039;s kindly and real.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Those corrupted,</i></p><p class="double"><i>They&#039;ll defeat!</i></p><p class="double"><i>They won&#039;t stop till they have ol&#039; Wily beat!</i></p><p class="double"><i>You have My Mega Pony,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Do you know you&#039;re all my mechanical Friends.</i> (*)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash went through her routine for the upcoming Best Young Flyer competition for the umpteenth time. Who&#039;d have thought so much would happen in such a short time?</p><p class="double">Right after Nightmare Moon was beaten, old Doc Wily had gone nutzoid a lot like Luna had a thousand years ago and hijacked a whole city. A <i>city</i>! According to Twilight, when Luna went Nightmare Moon a thousand years ago, she&#039;d just gone after her sister and busted up their old place in the Everfree. And because he was using robots to hold everyone hostage, no one could be sure the Elements would work as advertised.</p><p class="double">So Doc Light&#039;s robo-kids had stepped up to the plate and turned themselves into freaking superheroes! They&#039;d marched right into the city and saved everypony! Yeah, they came out a little banged up, but they did it with the fully-restored-to-their-right-minds robot masters marching right out with them, Doc Wily in hoofcuffs, and not one flesh-and-blood pony injured. Not even Doc Wily. Holy <i>snap</i>.</p><p class="double">What really blew her mind was just how life in Ponyville managed to continue like it was all no big deal. Gilda had dropped by in a visit that had nearly set her old friend and her new ones at each others throats, and she still had no idea how that sorted itself out. Applejack had nearly killed herself trying to pull in the whole harvest solo, and, oh yeah, they all had tickets for the upcoming <i>Grand Galloping Gala</i>!</p><p class="double">If only she could get this darned routine to go the way she wanted it. The competition wasn&#039;t that far off!</p><p class="double">&quot;Still having trouble with the Sonic Rainboom, are you?&quot; a familiar voice cut into her thoughts.</p><p class="double">Rainbow whipped around to see a familiar gray-coated earth pony stallion with a cutie mark of a shield superimposed over a sword. His brown mane was styled into a pompadour that would have looked ridiculous on <i>any</i>pony else, but he managed to make look awesome. With the ever-present shades and his trademark yellow scarf, he was quite the welcome sight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Blues!&quot; she greeted Doc Light&#039;s wayward son and runaway prototype cheerfully. &quot;How&#039;s life been treating ya?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Rock collected his thoughts,# &quot;this Trixie character tends to come in, boast about some feat she doesn&#039;t even realize the true scope of, challenge everyone that she can beat them at their own special talent, and all because she&#039;s convinced it&#039;s the best stage persona she could use?&quot;#</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Twilight nodded. &quot;And after alienating half the town by humiliating them onstage, a pair of impressionable colts get it into their heads to go into the Everfree and wake up an ursa minor so they can see the impossible feat for themselves. And since I like Ponyville un-stomped I try to head that off if I can, usually by nudging her in a more productive direction. And it&#039;s &#039;everypony&#039;, not &#039;everyone&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dad programmed us for political correctness in regards to the myriad of sapient species that inhabit the world. That&#039;s my story and I&#039;m sticking to it,&quot; Rock insisted. &quot;Wait a second. This Trixie is an over-the-top ham, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Every time I&#039;ve met her,&quot; Twilight agreed. &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Has anyone seen Auto?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Twilight blinked as she recalled the goofy stallion-bot who ran Light Lab&#039;s storefront and mechanic shop in town. The hammy robot who liked to build ridiculous over-the-top contraptions in his spare time. &quot;Oh, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;No, Dash,&quot; Blues sighed, &quot;I&#039;m saying that you being naturally suspicious is <i>part</i> of what makes you such a good fit for the Element of Loyalty. Some might say that the opposite of loyalty would be betrayal, but that&#039;s along antithetical lines. Suspicion is the opposite along complementary lines. You&#039;ve heard of the Yin-Yang theory, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Duh,&quot; Dash rolled her eyes. &quot;It&#039;s part of my martial arts classes. The whole &#039;everything in balance&#039; thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And &#039;balance&#039; is synonymous with &#039;Harmony&#039;,&quot; Blues completed the thought. &quot;The Elements couldn&#039;t work with ponies that embodied only positive traits, because that&#039;s not very harmonious, is it? Like night balances day, there needs to be a shadow aspect that balances the light. Suspicion is the logical shadow aspect of Loyalty. Because you are loyal to your circle of friends and the community at large, you are suspicious of anything that might jeopardize them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash was quiet as she mulled that over while the two walked into town. Huh, it looked like there was a show or something getting started.</p><p class="double">&quot;The same should be true of the others,&quot; the rogue prototype continued. &quot;Honesty works along with Deception, for to uncover truths one must grasp how they can be hidden. To be truly honest, one needs understand the ways in which they can be dishonest. This is especially true in the matters of <i>self</i>-deception.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I dunno...&quot; Dash hedged doubtfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Plus you&#039;d be surprised how easy it is to deceive some with nothing but honesty,&quot; Blues smirked. &quot;As for the others, like many parents show Kindness to their children, they also display great Ferocity in their defense. Generosity often goes hoof in hoof with Ambition, for one must <i>have</i> before one can <i>give</i>. Laughter connects with others in order to spread joy, which opens the possibility for great Sorrow when those connections are severed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what about Magic, smart guy?&quot; the stunt pegasus and part-time lab assistant challenged. &quot;Magic&#039;s not exactly a personality trait, is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;d think that,&quot; Blues smirked, &quot;but you&#039;d be wrong. The secret lies in the origins of the word. Long before Celestia or Luna, there was an order of unicorns known as the Magi. They were the ones who moved the sun and moon and turned the seasons, and none outside the order understood their secrets. The secret knowledge of the Magi came to be known as &#039;magic&#039; long before even other unicorns referred to the effects generated through their horns as such. The Magi were the only ones in those days that could be called scholars, and in a time when few others could even be considered educated. They were the seekers of knowledge, and the ones who always seemed to know what to do when mysterious events occurred. That is what &#039;Magic&#039; is: Things the Magi know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow,&quot; Dash blinked. &quot;Yeah, that&#039;s Twilight all over. How do you know stuff like this? I thought you were, ya know, developed for the Royal Guard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t honestly think my father would program a potential son without a thirst for intellectual pursuits, did you?&quot; Blues returned flatly.</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Dash rubbed her head sheepishly. &quot;You&#039;re still not gonna talk with him are you? Look, I know whatever it was that happened between you two probably <i>sounded</i> bad, but–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not...&quot; Blues interrupted her. &quot;Not yet. I&#039;m not ready. But... thanks for not giving up anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem,&quot; Dash smiled as the two inserted themselves into the crowd around the traveling stage, even as she cursed the stubbornness of Doc Light&#039;s eldest son.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians,&quot; an Unawake Trixie dared the crowd. &quot;Anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll take that challenge!&quot; a portly metal and mostly-green stallion with large red bubble-shaped eyes, a literally square jaw, and a large bolt in the top of his head declared as he jumped up on the stage and dramatically opened a paper fan designed like Equestria&#039;s flag while pointing at the showmare. &quot;Auto is in da hooouuusse!&quot; (6)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Twilight facehooved. &quot;The good news is that I think we&#039;ve avoided the Ursa Minor incident. The bad news is that your friend still managed to destroy Trixie&#039;s stage and damage the town.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rock winced as he surveyed the damage caused by Auto&#039;s last one-up on Trixie. That had escalated a lot faster than he&#039;d been prepared for. &quot;Sorry about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And seriously, <i>when</i> did he convert the shop into a pseudo-mecha?&quot; Twilight asked. <i>How</i> would be a good question too. No one in Ponyville had noticed him doing it. Though perhaps the renovations turning the store front into a giant replica of the upper portion of Dr. Light&#039;s mobile suitcase Eddie should have been a clue that Auto was up to something wacky.</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s native to my Loop, not Awake, and I&#039;m <i>still</i> trying to figure him out,&quot; Rock shook his head as he stepped up to offer his help rebuilding Trixie&#039;s wagon-stage. After moving &#039;Big Eddie&#039;s&#039; hydraulic foot off of it. Maybe he should just offer to have Light Labs invent her a whole new one.</p><p class="double">And he also needed to rescue Auto from the enraged showmare&#039;s assault. Maybe.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Things had been going more-or-less according to the general &#039;Equestrian Experience&#039; plan she&#039;d put together for visiting loopers since the capture of Dr. Wily. In essence, the plan involved the Awake Elements sticking relatively close to the baseline while doing their best to minimize collateral damage.</p><p class="double">But a few derailments were to be expected. For example: Fluttershy had gotten praise for her &#039;new level in badflank&#039; from the Unawake Rainbow Dash during the snoring dragon incident.</p><p class="double">A big one was how the Gala tickets had proceeded. Both Applejack and Pinkie Pie had convinced the Apples and Cakes to put in catering bids which had netted both business and complimentary tickets. Furthermore, Light Labs had such celebrity status that they&#039;d apparently been down for Gala invitations since before the Loop began. Dr. Light was still getting over the betrayal by his friend and colleague, and so had gifted both his and Wily&#039;s tickets to Spike (who he&#039;d never known as a &#039;baby&#039; dragon) and Rarity. Rock and Roll, and even Dash, in her capacity as part-time assistant, had gotten tickets as well. Which left no problems with Twilight letting Fluttershy have her extra. It was rather interesting how well it all worked out to be honest.</p><p class="double">Then there was the parasprite incident. They&#039;d been hashing out how to handle it without damaging Ponyville, or just skipping it altogether, when the reports came in that parasprites were <i>already</i> loose in the town.</p><p class="double">Apparently it was Auto&#039;s fault (big surprise, the bot was like a mad scientist/Pinkie-light/Trixie-ham/fan colt mish-mash at times) and they&#039;d quietly agreed not to use any quick-fixes. The nutty mechanic needed to learn that his actions had consequences.</p><p class="double">The mad scramble for instruments had been harder than they recalled though. They&#039;d forgotten how difficult fighting their way through panicked Ponyvillians could be at times, but in the end they&#039;d gotten the swarm back into the Everfree with minimal overall damage and a deal with Dr. Light to let him study one under controlled conditions to see if non-musical countermeasures could be developed.</p><p class="double">And then Celestia had shown up early for her scheduled visit, surprising the heck out of Twilight. Differences like that didn&#039;t tend to be innocuous.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, Princess,&quot; she greeted. &quot;You&#039;re early. I&#039;m afraid we aren&#039;t quite ready to receive you properly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As much as I wish this visit was social, my pupil,&quot; Celestia replied, all business, &quot;I&#039;m afraid my visit will need to be cancelled. I am stopping by to give you warning of a matter most grave before I return to emergency duties.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What matter?&quot; Twilight asked, getting a sinking feeling.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dr. Wily has escaped custody and is currently loose in Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t seem all that surprised,&quot; Twilight observed how the two visiting loopers were taking the news.</p><p class="double">&quot;We really aren&#039;t,&quot; Roll shrugged. &quot;We&#039;ve discussed trying to convince someone to send Wily to the moon, with enough supplies to build a self-sustaining habitation for one of course, but we&#039;re pretty sure he&#039;d come back in a lunar-built skull cruiser or something. There just isn&#039;t any prison we&#039;ve come across that can hold him indefinitely.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Is something wrong, Silver?&quot; Scootaloo asked her currently mechanical friend who seemed to be crying. Or at least as good an imitation as her body allowed for.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s nothing,&quot; Silver insisted. &quot;It&#039;s just–&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>You&#039;re not even a real pony!</i></p><p class="double"><i>I am so! I even have my own cutie mark!</i></p><p class="double"><i>And it&#039;s just as fake as the rest of you! Fake pony! Fake pony!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s Diamond Tiara,&quot; Silver sighed. &quot;She... How did you three ever put up with us?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We kinda didn&#039;t,&quot; Scootaloo admitted. &quot;Not in the baseline, and not when we were new loopers. It took us all a bunch of Loops before we managed to mature enough to deal with it. And not being your friends kinda helped with not taking it personally I guess. I can&#039;t imagine how hard it must be for you since, you know...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I kinda wish I couldn&#039;t either,&quot; Silver Spoon sighed. &quot;I had a hard time getting used to the &#039;new&#039; Diamond at first, but I think we&#039;re closer now than we ever were. Closer than our baselines ever <i>could</i> have been, I think. And it hurts because I know now how awesome my best friend can be and I have to watch this stubborn, petty, little <i>rrrggh...</i> just waste her potential! How the <i>leaf</i> did you three manage to get through to her again?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was all Applebloom, remember?&quot; Scootaloo reminded Silver. &quot;They told you how Discord stranded them together on a desert island, &#039;Bloom had already taken all her useful stuff outta her subspace pocket and decided not to use her looping abilities so it would be fair to DT meaning they&#039;d starve if they didn&#039;t work together.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Silver moped. &quot;I just keep hoping that something less... life threatening could work.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Scootaloo rubbed her chin, &quot;You know how she likes to suck up to her dad&#039;s rich business partners, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Silver sniffed. &quot;How do you think we knew each other originally?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shrugged the retort off before replying. &quot;Well, &#039;poppa Light&#039; runs a pretty successful business...&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver blinked and began to grin as wide as her metal face would allow as a plan began to come together.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Looking good, Dash,&quot; Roll grinned seeing the nervous pegasus in the gala dress Rarity had designed for her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seriously?&quot; Dash questioned, looking uncomfortable. &quot;I was kind of imagining something...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;20% cooler?&quot; Roll and Rarity deadpanned together.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah-heh...&quot; Dash rubbed the back of her head sheepishly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash,&quot; Rarity admonished, &quot;I have seen what you would consider &#039;cool&#039; and it is not proper gala wear!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Besides,&quot; Roll added, &quot;with the laced sandals and the laurel wreath, you look like you just stepped out of the winner&#039;s circle from the ancient Equestrian Games.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash blinked as that sunk in and turned to look herself over in the mirror again, striking a few &#039;victory&#039; poses. &quot;You really think so?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Do</i> give me some credit, dear,&quot; Rarity sniffed. &quot;I do not merely design fabulosity in this shop, I also match that fabulosity to the personality of the intended wearer and you are nothing if not an athlete. To suggest that I would allow anything unsuited to that trait to grace your frame,&quot; <i>&#039;at least when I&#039;m not deliberately embarrassing you for a prank,&#039;</i> she added silently, &quot;is an insult to my profession.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, well...&quot; Dash fished for something to redirect the conversation, &quot;what about Roll&#039;s dress? Not a whole lot to that one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Roll is a very simple mare,&quot; Rarity huffed. &quot;Excessive adornment just does not suit her. And red is quite her color, would you not agree?&quot;</p><p class="double">Indeed, Roll was currently modeling what could be termed a stereotypical &#039;little red dress&#039; were it not for the subtle circuitry highlights that shimmered when the light hit them just right.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am more curious as to who the stallion is you requested the suit for,&quot; Rarity decided to strike back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dash!&quot; Roll declared with acute interest. &quot;Do you have a <i>date</i>? Who is it? Where did you meet them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And <i>how</i> did you come by the extra ticket, dear?&quot; Rarity inserted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa!&quot; Dash backed up from the sudden assault. &quot;He&#039;s just an old friend! No one you&#039;d know,&quot; <i>&#039;and I&#039;m trying to fix that, stubborn Blues...&#039;</i> she cursed mentally, &quot;and the lab got an extra ticket for some reason! Honest!&quot; (7)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm... yes,&quot; Dr. Light mused at the idea his adopted daughter and her friend Silver had suggested. &quot;A business arrangement with Mr. Rich could be quite the boon for Light Labs if done properly. I&#039;ll see about making an appointment after Twilight and I finish up here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks dad!&quot; Scootaloo and Silver chirped as they raced back out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, to be young again,&quot; Dr. Light chuckled as he turned back to the project he was helping Celestia&#039;s prized student put together. Had the filly not insisted on making such a complex model, they&#039;d have already been done. But he&#039;d been so intrigued by the prospect of making a properly functioning alicorn model that he&#039;d let himself be talked into it. Why, the advances they&#039;d made in cross-race magical conversion just to get this one robot working the way it needed to <i>alone</i>...</p><p class="double">&quot;Focus doctor,&quot; Twilight&#039;s voice cut through his musings. Ah, how far she&#039;d come from the hero-worship she&#039;d started with. But familiarity and the informal air they strove to create around the lab had a way of tempering such things.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; he replied. They were in the most delicate final stage, the connecting of the strange orb Twilight had procured from the mystical discharge the cleansing of Nightmare Moon from Luna had produced to the robot body&#039;s processors. Done properly, the orb should function like an IC chip. &quot;Okay, you should connect the thaumic actuators to the...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight worked as the good doctor gave general directions. He&#039;d shown her how to build and connect everything, but the one who had done all the physical work on this robot was Twilight herself. This was to be <i>her</i> child after all, not his.</p><p class="double">Save for the race model difference, the body was like Silver Spoon&#039;s, a filly with the capacity for later updating to a more mature model. Scootaloo may have wanted a friend her own age back then, but he knew she&#039;d want that friend to grow with her eventually.</p><p class="double">He watched as Twilight made the last connection and closed the outer shell while the systems booted up for the first time. The robot filly blinked and looked around in confusion before fixing her gaze on Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Momma?&quot; the robot filly asked confusedly. &quot;Where did I Wake Up?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Interesting inflection on that question,&#039;</i> Dr. Light mused. Apparently Twilight&#039;s handling of the orb had created some manner of imprinting. No sign of the corruption Nightmare Moon was known for, thank goodness, and the robot filly hadn&#039;t even needed to be told who had built her. Absolutely fascinating.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right where you were supposed to, Nyx,&quot; Twilight&#039;s eyes watered before she enveloped the so-named mechanical filly in a hug. (8)</p><p class="double">Dr. Light promptly decided that this was a private moment and proceeded to make himself scarce.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Okay Dash,&#039;</i> the pegasus mare psyched herself up, <i>&#039;you&#039;ve got this. So, maybe you&#039;ve been having some trouble doing a Sonic Rainboom on command, but everything else you&#039;ve got down pat. So what if your old classmates from Flight School are still jerks? So what if half of Cloudsdale&#039;s still giving you dirty looks because you helped some smart guys break the weather monopoly? So what if Rarity just wowed everyone with that flutterwing spell Twilight cast on her? So what if Roll&#039;s debuting the pegasus harness right after your turn? It&#039;s like Doc Light said, no matter what you try to do, there will be ponies right there telling you you can&#039;t. If you really want to be the best no one&#039;s going to just hand you the title. You gotta make them believe you deserve it.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">She stepped out to cheers from some, boos from others but let it all wash over her. Her only focus was on her routine. Nothing else mattered.</p><p class="double">And it went amazingly. The shifts and turns were perfect. The crowd oohed and aahed in all the right places. She could tell that even her detractors were impressed. And then it all went south.</p><p class="double">The blast of wind had come out of nowhere and ploughed her straight into the stands. Her head was ringing when she heard a trio of impacts hit near her and she extracted herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll let that one slide,&quot; an unfamiliar voice boomed over the stadium, &quot;but if any one other than the Mega Mane or Mega Mare step forward then my seven brothers and their armies will destroy the areas they control.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Celestia!&quot; a stallion was panicking near her. &quot;My buds! They tried to catch Spitfire and got knocked off! They&#039;re not flying! Help!&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash didn&#039;t even think twice. A quick glance around showed the other Wonderbolts weren&#039;t conscious enough to make the rescue, so she opted to go after the falling ponies instead. She leapt off the stands and rocketed downwards towards the three as fast as she could, but the lead they had was too far for her to make it at subsonic speeds.</p><p class="double">She pushed harder and harder as she heard Roll fight against the attacker and the familiar barrier of air formed in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;You cannot defeat Air Tercel!&quot; (9) boomed the attacker above as she struggled against the air resistance, desperately trying for more speed. Three ponies&#039; lives were counting on her, and Rainbow Dash didn&#039;t let others down if she could help it.</p><p class="double"><b>*BOOM*</b></p><p class="double">And suddenly the resistance was gone. She&#039;d broken the barrier, but she didn&#039;t have time to celebrate as she grabbed the three unconscious pegasi and began to pull up as sharply as she dared to avoid the ground.</p><p class="double">Whew. They were safe and she even had enough momentum going to get them back up to Cloudsdale. On the way back up, she passed the falling body of a buff blue metal griffon with a huge fan in its torso and shortly after she was depositing a recovering Spitfire and two familiar stallions on the clouds.</p><p class="double">Of course it would be Hoops and Score that she just saved. Along with their aptly named pal Dumb-Bell, they were the worst bullies in all of Cloudsdale. But... she had to be honest. She&#039;d have gone after them even if she&#039;d known. They were jerks, but they didn&#039;t deserve to die for it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Dash!&quot; some reporter shoved a microphone in her face out of nowhere. &quot;Is it true that the power of friendship is what allowed you to do a Sonic Rainboom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot; Dash blinked. Where the hay did they get that idea? &quot;No. I mean, Spitfire&#039;s my idol, but we&#039;re not friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it true that you&#039;re in an illicit three-way relationship with the two stallions you saved?&quot; the reporter didn&#039;t even seem to have heard her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Like <i>buck</i>!&quot; she yelled loud enough to bowl the idiot over. &quot;I hate these jerks! They&#039;re my worst enemies short of Doc Wily!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then, why did you save them?&quot; someone else asked. Dash blinked and seriously considered the question for a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because if working at Light Labs has taught me anything, it&#039;s that we&#039;re here to help <i>everypony</i>,&quot; she told the more reasonable pony, &quot;not just those we like. And, yeah, you can quote me on that.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Blast it,&quot; Rock muttered in the stands as the commotion started to die down, though not quietly enough for Twilight to miss overhearing.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; she asked curiously.</p><p class="double">&quot;You heard Air Tercel before Roll engaged him, didn&#039;t you?&quot; Rock began rhetorically. &quot;How he referred to me as &#039;Mega Mane&#039; instead of &#039;Mega Stallion&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Twilight mused. &quot;That was odd... It&#039;s inaccurate of course, but nonetheless closer to your baseline title.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which means there&#039;s a good chance Dr. Wily&#039;s Dreaming again,&quot; Rock sighed, before noting Twilight&#039;s puzzled expression. &quot;I&#039;ll explain later, but right now Roll and I need to go and get the other seven before they get tired of waiting for us and do something we&#039;ll all regret.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Roll took cover behind some factory machinery as her opponent blasted fire at her. Of <i>course</i> Heat Man&#039;s local variant would be dragon-based.</p><p class="double">&quot;First Flash Mare, then Crash Mane, and now Heat Drake,&quot; Roll muttered as she did her best to avoid damage and find the best opening to retaliate. She and her brother were being led on a scripted series of battles that seemed designed to ensure they got almost all of the master weapons they needed <i>after</i> they&#039;d be useful. It was almost like Dr. Wily was daring them to use weapons they couldn&#039;t have gotten yet. Yeah, he was definitely Dreaming.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rock swore as he dodged another timberwolf. He&#039;d taken down Bubble Mare and Quick Mane already, but the local variant of Wood Man had holed up in the Everfree and had taken control of the resident timberwolves. All of them. Or at least what looked like it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Attack my loyal pack!&quot; the feral wooden robot growled, &quot;Attack in the name of Wood Alpha!&quot; (10)</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Leave it to Dr. Wily to make the local hostile flora even worse,&#039;</i> Rock cursed as he blasted a few more of the wooden wolves and tried to get a bead on their leader. He stopped as he spotted movement from the defeated timberwolves. Were they <i>reforming</i>?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dr. Light was helping direct his son and daughter&#039;s movements, with the enthusiastic aid of the Elements of Harmony, when a proximity alert went off. As more of the interior defenses, a necessary precaution since his former partner&#039;s attempts to conquer Equestria, went offline, he tapped a few buttons on the console.</p><p class="double">And then the door to the room was cut from its frame.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello doc, ladies,&quot; the robot that strode in greeted with sinister cheerfulness. His armor was patterned in red, yellow, and black with saw blades in the place of his mane. He formed a circular sawblade in a slot on each forehoof and set them spinning ominously. &quot;Now if you all would back away from that computer nice and slow, you can all get out of this with your limbs still attached.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity stepped forward, scowling. &quot;Now see here, you–&quot;</p><p class="double">The blade that launched at her from the robot&#039;s hoof came so fast and sudden that Twilight almost didn&#039;t get a shield up in time. She&#039;d later realize that the trajectory was a warning shot meant to leave her fashionista friend with a bad mane-cut and possibly short an ear, but not dead. And in the end, she needn&#039;t have bothered, because the blade was intercepted by a glob of liquid adhesive and pasted harmlessly against the wall.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the invading robot asked the one who&#039;d intercepted his shot.</p><p class="double">An orange and black robot pony with a head that looked like a paste dispenser stepped in and stared at the invader. &quot;DLN-009: Bond Mane,&quot; he declared.</p><p class="double">&quot;What a coincidence,&quot; the invading robot glared back, &quot;I&#039;m D<i>W</i>N-009: Metal Mane.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And then the nasty robot was all like &#039;grr! I&#039;m gonna cut ya up&#039;!&quot; Pinkie related as Rock and Roll both listened over the communications channel, &quot;and Bond Mane was all like &#039;not on my watch pardner&#039;! They fought like kung fu ninjas back and forth, trashing everything in sight for miles and–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, Bond Mane blasted Metal Mane with some hefty adhesive and left him plastered against the wall,&quot; Twilight interrupted, rolling her eyes. &quot;Your dad immediately disabled his communicator and mobility, but he&#039;s still otherwise functional.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good,&quot; Rock replied over the com. &quot;We&#039;re coming back to get his data and correlate it with the rest so we can find out where Wily&#039;s holed up.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight watched as Rock and Roll in their &#039;Mega Pony&#039; armor bumped hooves before entering the lab. It was interesting how little fanfare occurred to indicate what she knew was happening when they did that. The ability to scan and download information from a subject so thoroughly by just <i>touch</i>...</p><p class="double">The looping student of Celestia stamped down her rising fanfillying. This was <i>not</i> the time.</p><p class="double">Think about something else... Like how they made use of the teleport network Light Labs had set up to transport non-biological items and was even now being refined so it could be used on <i>living</i> subjects...</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Down girl,&#039;</i> she ordered herself. The two robot heroes were talking with Dr. Light. Apparently their shared data just needed one more piece to be complete and allow them to track where Dr. Wily had gone.

Wily&#039;s robot had shut down from the backlash, but the damage was done. Bond Mane had needed to glue both heroes to the wall so they could be examined without risking them harming anypony, and the news was anything but good.</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re contaminated with an energy similar to that of Nightmare Moon,&quot; Dr. Light gave the prognosis to the gathered Elements. &quot;It&#039;s really quite insidious. I couldn&#039;t tell it was even there until they had all the pieces that Wily placed in each of his robot masters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s different too,&quot; Twilight added, all business. &quot;I&#039;ve been talking with Luna and she likened her corruption to a whisper in the back of her mind so subtle it was hard to differentiate from her own thoughts. One that poked at her insecurities until the dark thoughts it put forth began to sound like good ideas and any other options were obscured by the constant repetition. What they&#039;ve got is more like a voice screaming at them, making it hard to think period.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My attempts at developing an anti-virus have failed,&quot; Dr. Light admitted. &quot;I am unable to remove this darkness from my children.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which means it&#039;s up to us, girls,&quot; Twilight told her friends. &quot;If we had more time, we could research other methods, but Dr. Wily needs to be stopped now and only these two have the information needed to find him. I&#039;ve already had Spike send a message to Princess Celestia requesting the use of the Elements of Harmony for this and they should be arriving shortly. Are you ready?&quot;</p><p class="double">Five determined nods were her reply.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rock felt the wave of Harmony wash over him and sweep away the dark pounding in his processors. Later, he would describe it like getting wake-up slapped with a revelation wrapped in a humbling sense of peace and acceptance.</p><p class="double">The sudden absence of the dark malware was just as jarring as its activation though, and he slumped where he was pasted to the wall next to his sister. However, a quick assessment of the remaining data had his head whipping right back up.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know where Dr. Wily is!&quot; both he and Roll declared together.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the video feed from the robot heroes showing Wily&#039;s Skull Fortress.</p><p class="double">&quot;How the hay did nopony <i>notice</i> this?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Hahahaha!

Then none shall be able to deny that I am <i>truly the greatest!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Rock and Roll were so busy parsing this new rant that they almost forgot that Wily often had a secret escape route. They had barely started moving when the doctor dropped through a trap door that closed after him.</p><p class="double">&quot;WARNING,&quot; a mechanical voice rang out. &quot;SKULL FORTRESS SELF-DESTRUCT IN FIVE MINUTES.&quot;</p><p class="double">The rant may have pointed to something different going on behind the scenes of this Loop, but the rush to outrun the castle&#039;s self-destruct was so familiar by now it could have been done with their optics off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The reports had been filed, and the two heroes were now resting from their ordeal as they regaled their collected friends, both Awake and not, of their battles.</p><p class="double">&quot;And then Ditzy Doo drops right out of the sky and collides with Bubble Mare, smashing them both into a nearby wall,&quot; Rock told the gathered ponies. &quot;They both go like this,&quot; Rock took a moment to cause his eyes to circle aimlessly and spoke the next line in a falsetto, &quot;&#039;I just don&#039;t know what went wrong&#039; before falling unconscious together.&quot;</p><p class="double">Laughter chorused through the room at Rock&#039;s impression.</p><p class="double">&quot;All joking aside though, she probably saved my life,&quot; Rock continued seriously. &quot;Or at least prevented serious injury. I&#039;m going to set up a tab with Sugarcube Corner to give her free muffins every day in perpetuity as thanks.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;He really said &#039;the stars&#039; had chosen him?&quot; Twilight asked pointedly once she&#039;d managed to get the two into a more private meeting with only Awake individuals present.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not those exact words,&quot; Roll clarified, &quot;but yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s... troubling,&quot; Spike mused. &quot;The prophecy of Nightmare Moon said &#039;the stars shall aid in her escape, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it&#039;s normally just an alignment of planets and moons and such,&quot; Twilight finished for him. &quot;Still, we&#039;ve had a bunch of variants where &#039;the stars&#039; were more than that, but there&#039;s no real pattern to who or why.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Wily&#039;s not normally known for working with anyone,&quot; Rock added, &quot;much less <i>for</i> anyone. The first is a short list that frequently ends in betrayal, and the second is practically nonexistent and has so far never been a case of Wily doing so both willingly and knowingly. Safe money&#039;s on either Wily, &#039;the stars&#039;, or both using the other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Could he be infected like Nightmare Moon was?&quot; Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s possible,&quot; Roll admitted.</p><p class="double">&quot;But the fact remains that he hasn&#039;t really been acting any different from what we&#039;re used to,&quot; Rock added. &quot;If he is corrupted by the nightmare, it didn&#039;t have to work too hard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which would explain why he went sour so durn fast,&quot; Applejack added.</p><p class="double">&quot;No more than usual,&quot; Rock clarified. &quot;Corrupted or not, neither theory is outside the realm of possibility.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, that&#039;s going nowhere,&quot; Twilight cut off debate. &quot;You promised me an explanation on what you meant by Wily &#039;Dreaming&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rock sighed before launching an explanation. &quot;As you know, our branch is pretty damaged. Inconsistent baseline, bugs, viruses, the whole nine yards. There&#039;s apparently a relatively stable bug that&#039;s occurred in both Dad&#039;s and Dr. Wily&#039;s Yggdrasil codes that allows them to randomly access memories from previous Loops they existed in. They tend to think of it as deja vu, a flash of brilliance, or premonitions, but they occasionally do things that can only be explained by Loop memories, however partial.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve heard of something like that before,&quot; Twilight pondered. &quot;A bunch of people in the Loop the Norns spend their time in ended up being able to retain Loop memories by way of consistent exposure to their divine auras, but no trained physical skills like a looper would. At least that&#039;s the most plausible theory I came up with. But their memories are much more coherent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Wily&#039;s has been a recurring headache for us,&quot; Roll informed them. &quot;It may be inconsistent, but we&#039;ve noticed that if we use certain tactics too much then he prepares for them more often. And then there&#039;s the fact that even without Dreaming he&#039;s smart enough to improve his inventions to match us if we start off too strong or overcome obstacles too easily.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s only going to be a matter of time before the stuff he&#039;s learned here ends up in something he makes back home,&quot; Rock finished wearily.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Fluttershy sympathized.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... sorry?&quot; Pinkie grinned awkwardly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Rock dismissed their worries. &quot;We&#039;re used to Wily pulling strange things out of nowhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So long as no one uses anything dangerously potent, we should be able to deal with it with no more problems than usual,&quot; Roll clarified.</p><p class="double">&quot;We could still blast him with the Elements,&quot; Spike offered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s table that option until we actually <i>find</i> him,&quot; Twilight told her assistant/little brother before turning back to the visiting loopers. &quot;Sorry the whole sanctuary thing isn&#039;t working out like it normally does.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Rock grinned suddenly. &quot;This has been great! We can actually walk around town without being mobbed by hero worshipers!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Roll agreed happily. &quot;And we haven&#039;t had to deal with one anti-robot terrorist organization, robot worshiping cult, or paranoid government agent since we got here!&quot;</p><p class="double">There were synchronized blinks from the Equestrian loopers as they processed that.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Blues!&quot; Rainbow Dash greeted her wayward friend at the edge of the Whitetail Woods. &quot;I got your message! You finally ready to go talk things out with your dad?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; the prototype robot decisively smashed her hopes. &quot;I just wanted you to know that I&#039;m leaving for a while.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Rainbow Dash blinked. &quot;But...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry,&quot; the shades-wearing robot stallion told her truthfully, &quot;but there&#039;s something I have to go do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re going to look for Wily, aren&#039;t you?&quot; Dash asked him flatly.</p><p class="double">&quot;.....Yes,&quot; the wayward brother of Equestria&#039;s heroes admitted. &quot;He&#039;s up to something bigger than anyone knows and someone has to find out what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, I guess I can accept that,&quot; Dash rubbed the back of her head. &quot;On one condition!&quot;</p><p class="double">Blues&#039;s eyebrow raised above his shades curiously. &quot;And what would that be?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That you&#039;re back in time to take me to the Gala,&quot; Dash stepped forward and tucked a golden ticket into his scarf. &quot;No excuses! Your dad&#039;s not going, and I don&#039;t know what the hay&#039;s up between you two in the first place, but you owe it to your brother and sister to at least <i>meet</i> them. And a formal setting&#039;s as good as any!&quot;</p><p class="double">Blues stared back at her emotionlessly before turning away, his scarf rustling in a sudden breeze.</p><p class="double">&quot;No promises,&quot; he told her as he walked away. After a few steps, he turned his head back. &quot;But I&#039;ll do my best.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">rIn the past few weeks, Diamond Tiara&#039;s world had been turned upside down. Her father had met with Dr. Light to make a business arrangement, a <i>lucrative</i> business arrangement, which meant that the bla–pegasus that was his adopted daughter had suddenly jumped from peasant to equal on the social scale where she was concerned. Which meant she needed to play nice or risk her father&#039;s contract since the odd but brilliant stallion thought the world of his children.</p><p class="double">It had been an... interesting experience.</p><p class="double">The fa–robot pony Silver Spoon has proven to be very cultured and refined once she&#039;d begun actually paying attention to her. As... she&#039;d... put it: &#039;Someone has to make sure Scoots behaves herself properly&#039;. And then Scoots had taken mild offense and the two had gotten to arguing.</p><p class="double">That had been an eye opener. She&#039;d thought Silver Spoon was some sort of personal servant that was created to be even more obedient than the hired help and there she was arguing childishly with the one she supposedly served.</p><p class="double">Even the pea–Applebloom and Sweetie Belle that Scootaloo liked to &#039;hang out&#039; with had proven good... friends in the end.</p><p class="double">It had been a rocky start at first, and mostly due to her she could now admit. For one, they&#039;d wanted her to <i>do</i> things, not just <i>talk</i> about things. And they were <i>very</i> insistent about that. Doing things herself had been scary after a life of having everything done for her by other ponies, but despite the dirt, the low-brow activities, and the tree sap that seemed to follow the group it had been... fun.</p><p class="double">And then the robo-alicorn &#039;daughter&#039; of Twilight, Nyx, had joined them. Diamond hadn&#039;t known what to make of her. She looked like... a filly Nightmare Moon for one, an alicorn for another, and yet acted like neither unless she was joking around. And she&#039;d been made without a cutie mark.</p><p class="double">The last part had become important recently. Diamond had thought Twilight was still deciding on one to give the robot filly when a sleepover at Fluttershy&#039;s had turned into a scramble for survival in the Everfree with a cockatrice. Nyx of all fillies had held the thing off, her metal body seemingly immune to the creature&#039;s petrifying stare, until Fluttershy pacified it.</p><p class="double">And had earned a cutie mark of a shield emblazoned with a crescent moon in the process, her talent being defending others.</p><p class="double">The phenomenon had floored her. According to miss Cheerilee, cutie marks were something unique to ponies (and pony-like races like zebras), which meant that Nyx could only earn one <i>if she was really a pony</i>.</p><p class="double">It was... intriguing to her to say the least. Plus, spending time around the bla–three who had yet to earn their cutie marks had caused her to start wondering about what her own meant. Surely it meant more than being a pampered princess and looking regal in the well-crafted look-alike tiara her father had commissioned for her..... right?</p><p class="double">Of course, that train of thought could wait until after she and the rest finished putting together their skit for the talent show. Honestly, the other three non-robotic &#039;crusaders&#039; were Tartarus-bent on taking on roles they were singularly unsuited for, and the other two weren&#039;t calling them on it for some reason.</p><p class="double">Maybe it was time somepony took charge...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;My Mega Pony, My Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhh...</i></p><p class="double"><i>(My Mega Pony)</i></p><p class="double"><i>I will stop your wily plans Doctor Wily</i></p><p class="double"><i>(My Mega Pony)</i></p><p class="double"><i>Saving the world from your villainy</i></p><p class="double"><i>Big adventures</i></p><p class="double"><i>Tons of fights</i></p><p class="double"><i>A determined heart</i></p><p class="double"><i>Faithful and strong</i></p><p class="double"><i>Saving the world!</i></p><p class="double"><i>It&#039;s not an easy feat</i></p><p class="double"><i>But I and my family will not retreat.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I am Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>And I will not fail all my very best friends!&quot;</i> (11)</p><p class="double">&quot;ARGH!&quot; the frustrated cry of Diamond Tiara interrupted Scootaloo&#039;s composition of the song for the group&#039;s talent show entry. &quot;That does it!</p><p class="double">&quot;Something wrong DT?&quot; Scootaloo asked the rich filly. <i>&#039;As if I couldn&#039;t guess.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Scootaloo,&quot; Diamond glared at her, &quot;your song is... not bad to be honest, but you are not a musical composer!

Exactly what we need for our set! No arguments!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom shut her mouth from where she&#039;d been about to protest.</p><p class="double">&quot;What about me then?&quot; Sweetie sulked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You will be rewriting the music into a proper song!&quot; Diamond ordered. &quot;No complaints! Don&#039;t think I haven&#039;t seen you giving our resident daredevil advice on how to improve her attempts! You are the song leader! Now hop to it!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;About time,&#039;</i> Scootaloo rolled her eyes. She wasn&#039;t bad with singing after all the Loops she&#039;d been through, but Sweetie was simply a natural at it. Heck, if this worked out alright, all three of them could earn their cutie marks at the same time. They&#039;d arranged it amongst themselves a few times when all three were Awake, but it tended to be hit-or-miss. The more they focused on earning their cutie marks instead of the task that would earn it for them, the less likely it was to work.</p><p class="double">&quot;What are you two talking about?&quot; Diamond had rounded on the two robot fillies.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, we&#039;d had a bet going on when you&#039;d snap and take charge,&quot; Silver told the pink earth pony filly. &quot;I won.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know whether to find that flattering or insulting,&quot; Diamond glared at the two as Scootaloo chuckled and began hashing out a choreography routine for the six of them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;My Mega Pony, My Mega Pony,</i></p><p class="double"><i>What are robots all about?</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony, My Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>Robots are magic!</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I used to wonder what robots could mean,</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>To a world that&#039;s all so serene.</i></p><p class="double"><i>When you were built your tasks around the house you&#039;d tend,</i></p><p class="double"><i>No robot masters to fight and no shining cities to defend</i></p><p class="double"><i>But My Mega Ponies, that old Wily had to try,</i></p><p class="double"><i>He took those made to improve things, turned their tasks into a lie</i></p><p class="double"><i>And you could do nothing but stand by.</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I used to wonder what robots could mean,</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>To a world that&#039;s all so serene.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Now you face danger when it comes around, you were remade in the Light,</i></p><p class="double"><i>You won&#039;t let the Blues take hold, you always take another try,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Demands for surrender, Automatically denied, Wily&#039;s lies you refuse to buy</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your metal hooves are grounded, a Rock-steady ally</i></p><p class="double"><i>Still you keep the laughter Rolling, to hold your spirits high.</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I used to wonder what robots could mean,</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>To a world that&#039;s all so serene.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your copy chip gives power, and it&#039;s growing all the time.</i></p><p class="double"><i>A new adventure waits for us each day is yours and mine.</i></p><p class="double"><i>We&#039;ll make it special every time!</i></p><p class="double"><i>We&#039;ll make it special every time!</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>What a beautiful ballad robots sing</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Mega Pony</i></p><p class="double"><i>How I hope your story never,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ends</i></p><p class="double"><i>Even as more robots Wily,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Sends</i></p><p class="double"><i>you&#039;re my very best</i></p><p class="double"><i>Friends,</i></p><p class="double"><i>you&#039;re my very best friends!&quot; </i>(*)</p><p class="double">Rock and Roll idly wondered how hard it would be to sneak out of the talent show&#039;s audience. The song their adopted sister and her five friends (three biological and two mechanical) were performing was flattering and all, but this kind of fame was embarrassing dang it!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara snuggled into her bed and gazed at the Best Show ribbon she&#039;d won with her friends. First place and three earned cutie marks in the process. That had to be some sort of record.</p><p class="double">Applebloom had gotten an actual apple bloom for hers, except one could see it was made of wood by the not-quite-finished paint job on it. A mark for how she was at her best when making things.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Bell had gotten a heart-themed musical note, and Nyx had said something about how a heart motif on a cutie mark was often an indication of the high level of love and care a pony put into their particular talent. Sweetie had blushed <i>crimson</i> at the praise.</p><p class="double">And Scootaloo had ended up with a shooting star on her flank. Even Diamond knew that star-themed marks denoted a high level of practical ability in the talent, and a shooting star was particularly impressive.</p><p class="double">But even that achievement paled in her personal estimate with how <i>proud</i> her parents had been. Over something she&#039;d done <i>herself</i>, not just ordered or paid others to do. Her father had gushed about how every great leader knew when to &#039;roll up their sleeves&#039; and do the dirty work. He&#039;d even given her a whispered confession that he&#039;d had to buckle down and do nearly every job in his own company at least once.</p><p class="double">Her dad thought she had the makings of a great leader. Because she&#039;d helped her friends achieve something great by &#039;rolling up her sleeves&#039; and helping them herself.</p><p class="double">With that thought and a smile, she drifted off to sleep.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Blues came back online in a cave. He&#039;d gone wandering and found what seemed like a promising place saturated with the dark presence he&#039;d identified from remote access to the lab&#039;s computers as similar to what had attacked his brother and sister this Loop. And so he&#039;d headed straight into it to find the source and see if Dr. Wily was involved, only to collapse as it started interfering with his systems.</p><p class="double">Even now, he could feel it surrounding him, but he was somehow immune. A quick check of his systems showed that he&#039;d actually been treated with the energy in a way that protected against its disruptive influence. His experimental thaumic energy core had been adj–</p><p class="double"><i>A repair to his faulty power core would end up erasing his personality.</i></p><p class="double">–usted even. Fixed. Improved no less. A familiar helmet rested on his head, and the kind of shield that had become his trademark in his home Loop was strapped to his foreleg. Those two things hadn&#039;t been there this Loop. Not yet. His original shield from his home Loop was both not properly weighted for his pony form and still in his subspace pocket.</p><p class="double">There was only one possible culprit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dr. Wily I presume?&quot; he asked the shadows around him, and was rewarded when the mad scientist stepped forth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, yes, my dear colt,&quot; the earth pony looked impressed. &quot;How did you guess?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only two ponies have this kind of ability,&quot; he stated flatly. &quot;And of them only you are on the run and hiding out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still a keen mind on you, I see,&quot; Dr. Wily observed him calculatingly. &quot;What brings you out here in the first place?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I needed a break from things,&quot; he said simply. &quot;And I am indebted to you for rescuing me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see...&quot; Wily pondered. &quot;Then perhaps in breaking away from your former self, you can help me break my enemies? Be my Break Mane.&quot;</p><p class="double">Blues remained silent and let the stallion draw his own conclusions.</p><p class="double"><b>Welcome back to the dark side.</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you will make a fine addition!&quot; Dr. Wily took the silence as agreement and led him into another room.</p><p class="double">Only his full-face helmet and shades prevented Blues&#039; expression from giving away his total shock at what was in that room.</p><p class="double">&quot;A fine addition to the stars indeed!&quot;</p><p class="double">#He had to get out of here and warn the others. He had to escape and tell them what was coming. Tell them of the he–</p><p class="double"><i>A living hell of his own making.</i></p><p class="double">–ll that had followed them to this fused Loop.</p><p class="double"><b>Oh, come on. Stay a while. You&#039;ll learn to like it.#</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Now, I have heard the Apploosans&#039; side of things. The land is the only flat arable area appropriate for growing the trees which are their primary food source. Complete removal of the trees would mean their starvation. However, I have not heard your side Chief Thunderhooves and I would like to so that I may see if we can come to some manner of agreement.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;It is simple. The path for our traditional stampede is sacred to us. It is unthinkable to stampede elsewhere.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Hmph. Typical tribal nons–&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;That is enough Sheriff Silverstar. Chief Thunderhooves, I can tell that you and your buffalo are fair, mighty, and wise. And it is my experience that such beings do not simply create traditions from nothing, especially not sacred ones. So, please, tell me why this path is so sacred.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Something about that way the older pony, this &#039;Doctor Light&#039;, spoke, with intelligence and respect, had told him that he would not be dismissive of his tribe&#039;s beliefs. And so he had told the pony the origins of the stampede and why it was such an important tradition to the buffalo.</p><p class="double">When he had finished, the pony hadn&#039;t derided him for &#039;backwards&#039; thinking or dismissed his concerns as those of a &#039;savage&#039;. Instead, he&#039;d spoken fondly of a tradition from his own home. A &#039;running of the leaves&#039; that sounded so much like his tribe&#039;s sacred stampede that he could almost believe the pony was really a buffalo at heart.</p><p class="double">And then Sheriff Silverstar had added a tradition of his own from before he&#039;d come out to this area to settle with the other ponies, with none of the rancor or condescension he&#039;d shown before. He&#039;d responded with a tale of his tribe&#039;s spring celebrations, to which Light responded with a story of the Hearth&#039;s Warming winter &#039;holiday&#039;, followed by the sheriff&#039;s telling of his last &#039;family reunion&#039;.</p><p class="double">It had been a grand story-telling that lacked only an equally grand fire, but instead topped off with those <i>delicious</i> apples.</p><p class="double">At some point, two of the farming ponies who were in charge of the trees had joined them and he was showing them on a map just where the stampede&#039;s path went. Most of the orchard could actually be kept with no disruption, but it was not an insignificant amount of trees that would have to be moved.</p><p class="double">But Light seemed to have answers for everything. He&#039;d asked questions regarding the needed traits of the land for the trees and before the chief knew it he&#039;d been telling them of an area not prohibitively far away that could serve to grow those trees that were moved. It was less flat, but the quality of the soil and nearness to water would serve.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d even found himself telling the ponies of plants native to the region that were perfectly good sources of food for his own buffalo and could be more easily grown in the arid region than the trees the ponies prided themselves on. And the farm ponies had listened, even offered a share of the apples to his buffalo for the use of the remaining land. It was nothing short of a miracle he&#039;d witnessed.</p><p class="double">Not to say that his tribe conceded nothing in the exchange. For one, he&#039;d ended up volunteering the tribes services to help move the trees from the stampede path to their new grounds and promised to help teach the pony farmers how to grow and prepare the native food plants his own tribe normally subsisted on. For another, the ponies seemed quite interested in trading for tribal goods the buffalo made.</p><p class="double">But the most interesting one was what Light himself had requested. He wanted the chance to join the tribe in their sacred stampede. Such was hardly forbidden, but none outside the tribe had ever <i>asked</i>.</p><p class="double">And now here he was, about to start the traditional sacred stampede with his tribesbuffalo, and over a dozen of the ponies mixed in among them.</p><p class="double">&quot;It has been my observation that no matter how true traditions remain to their origins, some change is inevitable,&quot; the pony known as Light spoke sagely next to him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; he agreed. His grandfather had liked to rail against the inclusion of tribal adornments in the stampede, claiming that true buffalo would never run while wearing such frivolous things. &quot;Not always for the better, but sometimes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps this is one such time?&quot; Light inquired as the stampede began.</p><p class="double">&quot;Only the future may tell,&quot; he replied as the thundering of hooves grew in volume with the advance of the mixed herd of buffalo and ponies.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The CMC might not be trying for cutie marks anymore, but they still went out and tried some crazy stuff to see what else they might find fun. Scootaloo&#039;s adoptive father was good at plenty of things outside his own cutie mark of a lit bulb, and so they&#039;d decided to try and see what else the six of them could learn how to do. How their current outing had led to getting stories from other ponies about how they earned their cutie marks was something Diamond wasn&#039;t too clear on, but she had to admit that some of them were shaping up to be pretty interesting. Just like the marks themselves, no two ways of earning them seemed to be exactly alike.</p><p class="double">&quot;You really fought off a chupacabra with a broom?&quot; Diamond Tiara asked Roll incredulously after she and the other crusaders heard her cutie mark story.</p><p class="double">&quot;He was making a mess,&quot; Roll stated simply.</p><p class="double">Huh. No wonder her cutie mark looked the way it did. It was a <i>combat</i> broom. Diamond wouldn&#039;t have believed such a thing possible before then.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks for helping me get out of there,&quot; Blues told his current companion.</p><p class="double">&quot;I should be thanking you,&quot; the beige-coated pegasus mare with a mane in various shades of gray, a compass rose cutie mark, and wearing a pith helmet, known to most as Daring Do, replied. &quot;I&#039;ve dealt with most of that crowd before, but never all at once.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bet it gets rather repetitive,&quot; Blues observed carefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;You have <i>no</i> idea,&quot; Daring rolled her eyes as they put as much distance between themselves and the temple as possible.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ever go back in time?&quot; the robot stallion decided to fish a bit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thankfully, no,&quot; Daring told him with no indication that the question meant anything out of the ordinary to her. &quot;I&#039;ve heard of some things that are supposed to do that but all the ones I&#039;ve found have been either duds or broken, assuming their abilities weren&#039;t outright falsehoods to begin with.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose we should take our blessings where we get them,&quot; he allowed. <i>&#039;Not looping. Though she didn&#039;t seem to think anything was off with that group, so no big surprise.&#039;</i> He&#039;d recognized parts of the group&#039;s appearances as being from his Loop, which meant they were significantly different from whatever this place&#039;s baseline had. So if Daring was Awake, she&#039;d have seemed a lot more surprised than she had been.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right now, I&#039;d be happy with the blessing of some faster transportation,&quot; Daring grumbled. &quot;We need to get word to the princesses about what that lot is up to and you&#039;re the only one who can offer proof.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>No one will believe it.</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; he told her sincerely, &quot;I&#039;d give you the data but we can&#039;t risk whatever they infected me with spreading to other devices.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s mane fell straight as the hairdryer lifted from her head, only to immediately poof back up.</p><p class="double">&quot;I swear,&quot; Rarity huffed as she watched the phenomenon happen, &quot;you do that on purpose.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww,&quot; Pinkie grinned cheekily, &quot;but the poofy mane look is just me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I dunno,&quot; Rock said from where he&#039;d been roped into getting groomed with the rest by his sister. &quot;You look pretty good with a straight mane too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, but it doesn&#039;t really go with my gala dress,&quot; Pinkie admitted with a smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Ah&#039;m</i> still trying to wrap my mind around tha two a&#039; ya going ta tha gala together,&quot; Applejack interjected from where she was polishing Fluttershy&#039;s hooves. &quot;How&#039;d <i>that</i> happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I asked, she said yes,&quot; Rock shrugged nonchalantly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think Applejack meant &#039;why Pinkie?&#039;,&quot; Twilight elaborated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why not?&quot; Rock looked confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>I</i> think it&#039;s cute,&quot; Roll insisted from where she was taking the opportunity to style her brother&#039;s mane in a ridiculous fashion she knew he would adjust to something more sensible once she and the others were finished having fun.</p><p class="double">&quot;Says the sister who&#039;d ship me with anything female and not family,&quot; Rock shot back.</p><p class="double">&quot;I would not!&quot; Roll looked offended. &quot;There&#039;s an age and beauty requirement too.&quot; She thought for a second before adding: &quot;And a sanity one.&quot; (12)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You sure?&quot; Daring asked Blues as the two came within sight of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Blues replied. &quot;My father can get you in touch with your contacts while I head to Canterlot and inform the princesses.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the gala?&quot; the adventurer mare continued.</p><p class="double"><b>Oh, that sounds fun!

We have that much time at least. Besides, I have a promise to keep.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dash sighed as she trotted over to her dress so Rarity could get her done up in time for them all to make the carriage Twilight arranged for them. No word from her &#039;date&#039; for the evening. No letter, no message, no noth–</p><p class="double">She stopped when she saw the stallion mannequin next to the one that had her dress bereft of the tuxedo it had held, a damp towel and a note in the garment&#039;s place.</p><p class="double"><i>Meeting you there. Sorry if I worried you.</i></p><p class="double"><i>- Blues</i></p><p class="double"><i>P.S. How&#039;s my stealth?</i></p><p class="double">Dash shook her head in amazement. Only Blues would treat getting into his gala tux as a spy mission.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I must say, this is quite the pleasant surprise Daring,&quot; Dr. Light smiled as he led the adventurer to the communications array, both of them politely pretending not to notice the six starry-eyed fillies who thought themselves well-concealed. &quot;How many years has it been since that unpleasantness down south?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Too many to justify not keeping in touch and not nearly enough to get over what happened,&quot; Daring admitted as she began entering something into the panel. &quot;And I wish it was a social call that brought me here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who is–&quot; a young female voice answered the call Daring had made, only to cut off in an excited squeal. &quot;Ohmygosh! It&#039;s Daring Do!&quot;</p><p class="double">Dr. Light chuckled as the golden-feathered griffon child on the vid-screen went full fanhen over his now flustered guest.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>See?!</i>&quot; the child insisted to an older griffon hen whose feather coloration was more &#039;bald eagle&#039; than &#039;golden eagle&#039;. &quot;See cousin Gilda?! I <i>told</i> you she was real!&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffon friend of Rainbow Dash who had visited earlier that year simply stood there gawking at his visitor.</p><p class="double">&quot;I do apologize for any impoliteness,&quot; Dr. Light told the older griffon, &quot;but we need to speak with your uncle. It&#039;s quite urgent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Gilda shook her head in a daze as she focused on the task given to her. &quot;I&#039;ll go get him. Come on, squirt.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay!&quot; the younger griffon chirped as she followed the other. &quot;Bye Miss Do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who was the younger one?&quot; Daring asked once they had left.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you forget that he had a daughter?&quot; Dr. Light raised his eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;But... he said she&#039;d just hatched!&quot; Daring sputtered. &quot;Has it really been that long?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid it has,&quot; a male voice came over the communicator as a stern-looking adult male griffon with golden feathers and eyeglasses stepped into view. &quot;Bright, Daring,&quot; he greeted amiably. &quot;What seems to be the problem?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as she stepped out of the carriage and spotted an unfamiliar stallion in a pompadour and sunglasses, at night no less, waving to her and her friends. Or rather, to a specific member of the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;You made it!&quot; Rainbow dashed over to what was apparently her escort, she&#039;d been rather insistent that it wasn&#039;t a &#039;date&#039; to all of them, for the evening.</p><p class="double">&quot;I promised, didn&#039;t I?&quot; the stallion smirked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Rarity walked up to the two hoof-in-arm with teen-form Spike, &quot;aren&#039;t you going to introduce us to your coltfriend Dash?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I keep telling you, it&#039;s not like that!&quot; Dash insisted, &quot;but this is–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;DLN-000, Blues Light,&quot; Roll cut in as she and her brother, with Pinkie in tow, joined Rarity. &quot;Nice to finally meet you, brother.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m surprised you managed to get him here,&quot; Rock added. &quot;He certainly hasn&#039;t been returning any of <i>our</i> calls since we found him in the Lab&#039;s database.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You never said they&#039;d been calling you!&quot; Dash poked the prototype pony-bot with her hoof accusingly.</p><p class="double">Twilight noted the dirty look Blues shot his siblings as Pinkie began going into full party planning mode regarding the older robot&#039;s getting-the-family-back-together party.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not talking to my father,&quot; Blues cut her off so sharply that Pinkie halted in mid-air and slowly drifted to the ground. &quot;This isn&#039;t just a social call either. I&#039;m here to speak with the princesses immediately after the gala. I have important information regarding national security for them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How important is it?&quot; Twilight found herself asking, taken aback by how serious he&#039;d sounded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not so important that I want to risk causing a panic with the gala in full swing,&quot; he told them. &quot;But it concerns Dr. Wily. And a group called The Stars.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m glad you could come over so fast,&quot; Dr. Light greeted the griffon as he stepped out of the Lab&#039;s teleporter. #The #long distance teleportation network was a recent development in unicorn magical emulation and still limited in regards to who had access to it, but significant strides in the technology were being made.</p><p class="double">&quot;Think nothing of it,&quot; the griffon scientist said as his daughter came through next, followed by his niece Gilda. &quot;If this is as serious as Daring claims, we can&#039;t waste any time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the voice of a young filly cut into the conversation as Scootaloo entered the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi!&quot; the youngest griffon scampered eagerly over to the pegasus filly. &quot;I&#039;m Kalinka! Who are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Scootaloo,&quot; the adopted daughter of Dr. Light answered, &quot;and these are my friends Applebloom, Silver Spoon, Sweetie Belle, Diamond Tiara, and Nyx.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; Kalinka oohed as she spotted the black pony robot. &quot;You&#039;re an alicorn!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; Dr. Light chuckled. &quot;Many of you recall Kalinka&#039;s cousin Gilda,&quot; he gestured to the older griffon female who waved half-heartedly before turning to the male griffon. &quot;And this is her father and a good friend of mine, Dr. Mikhail Cossack of the Griffon Empire.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, well,&quot; Spitfire arched an impressed eyebrow, &quot;you&#039;re Light&#039;s guard prototype? I remember him claiming that you&#039;d be the equal of any wonderbolt once he got you up in the air.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s because he&#039;s been testing the pegasus harness against Dash here,&quot; Blues gestured to his companion who was doing her best not to hyperventilate at holding a conversation with her idol. &quot;She&#039;s been setting the gold standard for the device since day one at the lab. There&#039;s still a few kinks to work out from what I hear.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Spitfire turned her attention to the rainbow-maned pegasus. &quot;I saw the footage of that thing in action against Air Tercel. It&#039;s a fine piece of work as it stands, and it still doesn&#039;t measure up to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Dash began sheepishly, feeling oddly embarrassed by the praise, &quot;Doc Light insists on it being the best, which means I&#039;ve got to give it <i>my</i> best, so...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see,&quot; Spitfire hmmed. &quot;Well, you&#039;re already invited to our training camp next spring for your performance in the young flyers&#039; competition, and after hearing this, I expect to see great things from you then.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash <i>almost</i> contained the resulting squee of joy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Daring Do stared intently at one of Mikhail&#039;s robots that had come through the lab&#039;s teleporter after him. &quot;Who are you supposed to be?&quot;</p><p class="double">The sphinx model robot stared back at her just as intently. &quot;I am Pharaoh Sphinx, developed after extensive research on the kinds of temples you yourself tend to come across. I am fully equipped for trap detection and disarmament, my solar-energy Pharaoh Shot is both a light source and a defensive weapon, and I am tempered to withstand the dark magic of the vilest and most malevolent curses with little issue. The pharaoh theme is mostly aesthetic, though I won&#039;t complain if it means a few curses think I&#039;m supposed to be there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You made a robot to do my job?&quot; Daring turned her stare to the robot&#039;s creator.</p><p class="double">&quot;I made a robot who could withstand the dark magic saturating those ruins we all visited back then,&quot; Dr. Cossack defended himself.</p><p class="double">Daring winced at the reminder of one of the few places she&#039;d gone that didn&#039;t appear in the books she&#039;d written as A.K. Yearling. Not because it was uneventful, most of those at least got mentions when they became relevant, but because it was her biggest failure. None of them had gained anything from that place, and suffered losses instead. She wondered if the diamond dog Pedro had ever recovered from his injury.</p><p class="double">&quot;I any case, I think we should share what we know,&quot; Dr. Light reminded his colleagues of why they were here as the giggling voices of the seven children emanated from another room.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Daring admitted. &quot;I went back to the Lanfront ruins after a series of rumors regarding some of my old adversaries reached my ears. I managed to sneak in, barely, and discover that they were all part of the same cult group. I only escaped due to the help of your eldest &#039;son&#039; Bright, but not before I found out that they&#039;re all planning something big. Have been for some time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You said they were part of a cult,&quot; Dr. Cossack pushed his glasses up his beak. &quot;Which one?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They call themselves &#039;The Stars&#039;,&quot; Daring told them to sharp intakes of breath. &quot;The same ones who were predicted to be responsible for the return of Nightmare Moon. Not sure how accurate that part is, but the cult&#039;s been around at least a thousand years under that name. But it&#039;s been around even longer under other names, their goal for ages to plunge the world into &#039;eternal darkness&#039;. Originally, it was called the Order of Le Mu, or depending on who was translating, the Order of Ra Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Is it ready?&quot; a voice in the shadows asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes...&quot; the gleeful voice of Dr. Wily responded. &quot;With my enhancements the device is now ready to fire. No need for those inefficient baubles hidden is crumbling temples you used to go after.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then let the darkness fall so the Stars may reign supreme.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A wave of dark magic spread out from the area south of Equestria known as the Lanfront ruins, affecting everything in its path. All animals not born of dark magic stumbled and collapsed as it swept over them and trees began to lose color. The shadows choked the sky and stifled all light above so it could never reach the ground.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the dark wave passed over Equestria, magical devices ceased functioning and ponies everywhere stumbled and fell where they stood. Unicorns blacked out completely and many pegasi were injured from the crashes that resulted when the weather magic they relied on to aid flight was disrupted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In a power plant, Elec Mare shorted out and fell to the floor.</p><p class="double">Guts Stallion collapsed on stage at a karaoke bar he&#039;d gone to after his shift, his backup singers Bomb Stallion and Cut Mare fell beside him as well.</p><p class="double">Fire Mare&#039;s flames went out suddenly while she was on the night shift at a Manehattan waste disposal plant.</p><p class="double">Ice Mare fell face-first in the snow far in the frozen north.</p><p class="double">Cloudsdale shuddered as the wave passed over it and began to lose cohesion. Those pegasi that retained consciousness would manage to push the clouds towards the ground afterwards in an effort to evacuate the city before it lost form completely.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Scoots?&quot; Nyx asked her unconscious friend worriedly. &quot;Bloom? Silver? DT? Sweetie? Kalinka? What just happened?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So what&#039;s the big important secret you need to tell the princesses?&quot; Dash asked as she danced with her escort for the evening. She&#039;d figured that she&#039;d spent so much effort getting all fancied up that she might as well at least once.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll find out in due time,&quot; Blues smiled secretively. &quot;Just relax and enjoy the night until then.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You love doing that, don&#039;t y–&quot; she cut off as she felt her connection to the Element of Loyalty, the one Twilight had been training her and the others in developing, flare hard enough to give her a headache before going dark. She had just enough time to wonder what that meant before she lost consciousness as well.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;SISTER!&quot;</b> Blues heard a terrified voice bellow as he did his best to keep his &#039;date&#039; for the evening from hitting the floor. All of a sudden everyone at the gala had swayed and collapsed. The unicorns all looked to be unconscious, and the pegasi and earth ponies were at best too disoriented from whatever had happened to stand. A quick check showed that his brother and sister were completely offline.</p><p class="double">The only ones still standing were himself and an angry alicorn of the night now stomping up to him. Behind her, he could see a very much knocked out Celestia.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;YOU!&quot;</b> Luna bellowed loud enough that he had to brace himself in order to ensure he didn&#039;t fall over. <b>&quot;EXPLAIN WHAT SORCERY THIS IS THAT LAYS OUR LITTLE PONIES LOW! EXPLAIN WHY THOU STAND WHEN THEY DO NOT!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Princess,&quot; he said respectfully, &quot;I suspect I&#039;m still standing for much the same reason you are. We&#039;ve both played unwilling host to a dark force like the one that did this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s eyes widened in terror as she processed that statement.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx took several deep breaths, which she&#039;d later admit didn&#039;t really do anything for her mechanical body, and tried to calm down and remember what her mom had told her to do when situations like this cropped up in the Loops.</p><p class="double">First step in this kind of situation: Check the victims.</p><p class="double">The other Crusaders, Awake or otherwise, were unconscious but not injured. That at least was a relief.</p><p class="double">Second step: What could she do about it?</p><p class="double">Without knowing what had caused their sudden collapse... not much. Her robot form this Loop wasn&#039;t capable of channelling the full range of magical abilities she was used to, but she could still take most opponents with the contents of her subspace pocket if nothing else. But there wasn&#039;t any villains to fight right now, or at least none that she could sense...</p><p class="double">Third step: Who did she know who could help?</p><p class="double">Her mom had told her that, for the most part, Loop memories and instincts could be trusted. Because many Loops seemed to subscribe to narrative causality to some extent, Loop instincts could at least be trusted to &#039;advance the plot&#039; as it were. It wasn&#039;t a bad fallback strategy in any case.</p><p class="double">And according to Scoots and Silver, Dr. Light generally either knew what to do or could figure something out. Her experiences around the lab certainly hadn&#039;t contradicted that. He was a lot like her mom in some ways.</p><p class="double">Which was how she found herself racing down the halls as fast as her hooves could carry her, shouting for the older stallion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dr. Light! Dr. Light! Come quick! Hel–EEEK!&quot; She yelled as she barrelled around the doorframe into the lab where she knew he was entertaining guests, and almost ran into a pony-like figure done up in modern zebra voodoo stereotype with bones and skulls and a just downright spooky and scary demeanor.</p><p class="double">She was so keyed up by the situation that she let out a bolt of magic at the sinister figure out of sheer reflex, and gulped as it dissipated on a shimmering sinisterly-shaped barrier.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot; Rarity asked wearily as she returned to consciousness.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot; said unicorn inquired as she shook the cobwebs out of her mind.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are we on the floor of the palace ballroom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did someone leave the gag running?&quot; Pinkie queried blearily from nearby.</p><p class="double">Twilight ignored her friend&#039;s non sequitur as she took stock of what was going on. She&#039;d been enjoying the gala as it was meant to be enjoyed for a change of pace, she and the rest of her friends had somehow been coaxed onto the dance floor, and then her brain at the base of her horn had metaphorically exploded resulting in the loss of consciousness.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Okay, I think this Loop just crossed the &#039;non interference&#039; line,&#039;</i> she thought to herself as she noted the completely offline forms of the visiting Anchors amidst ponies in varying states of recovery from unconsciousness. Idly filing away the fact that unicorns seemed the worst off, she got to her feet and began to list out a course of action.</p><p class="double">Step one: Figure out what just happened.</p><p class="double">She made to cast a few scrying spells, and blinked when nothing happened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s try that again,&quot; she muttered to herself and tried to put some more effort into it, only to promptly stop as pain shot through her head near her horn and her vision swam.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Alright, bad idea...&#039;</i> she managed to remain standing. <i>&#039;Let&#039;s skip a few steps and go straight for the Elements then.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Twilight stood there for a few seconds before the fact that the Element of Magic was refusing to manifest sunk in.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;How...?&#039;</i> she thought as she examined her connection with the soul-bound artifact. <i>&#039;Okay, it&#039;s still </i>there<i>, but it&#039;s... weak or something.&#039;</i> Whatever happened was somehow interfering with the Elements. It wouldn&#039;t be the first time something managed to shut them down, a few Loops with the Smooze came to mind, but it wasn&#039;t exactly a common occurrence.</p><p class="double">Twilight decided to cut straight to the chase and go full alicorn. She&#039;d explain later, maybe use excuse 3Q this time. She hadn&#039;t tried that one in a while.</p><p class="double">When she regained consciousness again, Twilight would liken the attempt to trying to manually turn herself inside out. Without pain killing effects of any kind.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m <i>so</i> sorry!&quot; Nyx apologized for the umpteenth time as she and the voodoo zebra figure finished moving her friends someplace more comfortable.</p><p class="double">As it turned out, the griffon scientist had brought more of his robots, eight in all, through the portal with him. Skull Mane was the zebra-like model done up with stereotypical voodoo accessories like an equine skull-shaped helmet, bones (both real and fake) braided into his mane and tail, and the power to make barriers in the same shape as his helmet.</p><p class="double">Plus he was one of only two of Dr. Cossack&#039;s robots that hadn&#039;t been shut down by whatever it was. Even the lab&#039;s systems, mostly running on magic generators, were offline.</p><p class="double">&quot;It is fine,&quot; the robot replied politely. Again. &quot;As I keep telling you, I was designed as a guardian. A fearsome appearance is one of the oldest methods of defense that any intelligent race has practiced. By appearing frightening, I cut down the number of hostile creatures that wish to test my abilities in the first place and make many more unsure about attacking what I defend. Scaring allies and potential friends is an unfortunate side effect I have learned to live with.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But I <i>still</i> shouldn&#039;t have assumed–&quot; Nyx protested.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; the zebra-bot cut her off. &quot;That an unfamiliar figure in your home might be responsible for the attack that harmed your friends and family? While my appearance might not do me many favors in regards to misunderstandings, it was hardly the only strike against me in this case.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, okay,&quot; Nyx finally relented. &quot;How are you moving around still anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like Pharaoh Sphinx, I am tempered to resist the disruptive influences of dark magic,&quot; Skull Mane explained as the two headed back to the lab. The doctors had recovered relatively quickly and had requested to see her after her friends were secured. &quot;It would be very inconvenient in my duties if my defenses could be circumvented by any sinister party with basic knowledge of malevolent curse-style magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, there you are Nyx,&quot; Dr. Light&#039;s voice greeted warmly, if a bit weakly. &quot;I must again say I am pleased to see you unaffected by whatever has befallen us. With your permission, I and Dr. Cossack would like to study how you resist this influence. His method of shielding against dark magic should prove enough to get parts of the lab up and running in a few days, but I think you may be able to help speed that timeframe up.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Tree damn this Loop and whoever did this!&#039;</i> Rarity growled as she massaged her aching head and continued walking down the palace hallway. <i>&#039;When I find the rooter responsible I will buck them straight into the sun!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">She&#039;d watched as Twilight fell to the floor of the ballroom in a seizure mere moments after recovering from the unexpected disaster that had rendered them unconscious in the first place. She had yet to regain consciousness since.</p><p class="double">Nor was Twilight the only one adversely affected. Celestia also had yet to awaken, and Shining Armor had reported that Cadance was in the same state. It was thus little surprise that the panic incited by Celestia&#039;s forced indisposal meant they hadn&#039;t noticed what had become of their newest looping friends Rock and Roll until somepony literally tripped over their inert forms.</p><p class="double">The robots, along with all other electronics or magical devices, had been shut down by the event and remained utterly inoperable. That their brother Blues was unaffected was a mystery.</p><p class="double">Speaking of those mysteriously unaffected, Luna had done her duty and taken charge of Equestria while her sister recovered, and was being run into the ground by the constant demands on her time and attention.</p><p class="double">Reports had come in of the effects on other areas of Equestria and they hadn&#039;t stopped since. The shroud of darkness over Equestria made high noon no brighter than a moonlit night, and nighttime... It was dark enough to give even the bravest ponies shivers. Panic ran rampant in all cities and towns and civil services everywhere were stretched beyond their limits. Cloudsdale in particular had been completely destroyed as the magic holding it together came undone, and only the brave efforts of many of its citizens had saved the rest. It was a miracle and a testament to Equestria&#039;s solidarity that there had been no deaths.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Gah!&#039;</i> Rarity swore internally as another sharp pain lanced through her head. <i>&#039;It&#039;s so hard to </i>think <i>these days... And nothing makes it any better!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Then there were the effects on the ponies themselves. With the notable exception of Luna, magic had all but left the populace of Equestria. The most anypony of the three races was capable of performing were the most basic of cantrips. Unicorns like Rarity herself suffered from severe headaches at the base of their horns and even basic telekinesis for many (though not Rarity herself for some reason) became impossible. Pegasi had lost their ability to use weather magic and those like Rainbow Dash who used it almost all the time were effectively grounded as a result. Even earth ponies were finding out how much magic they used subconsciously as their daily tasks became that much harder and many complained of aching limbs. Perhaps the most telling of all was that Pinkie&#039;s mane had gone razor straight and she couldn&#039;t re-poof it without exhausting herself.</p><p class="double">She and the remaining Awake Elements, including Spike even though he wasn&#039;t &#039;on duty&#039; this Loop, had convened to discuss their options for dealing with the situation while the Unawake Rainbow Dash had been asked to see if she could get anything out of Blues as to why he wasn&#039;t affected. The options were... not encouraging.</p><p class="double">With Twilight down, the Elements of Harmony would have been off the table even if they hadn&#039;t gone dormant. They&#039;d given reactivating them a decent effort, but the results had been along the lines of &#039;diddly&#039; and &#039;squat&#039;. Then they&#039;d tried pulling things out of their subspace pockets to make an assessment, only for technological devices to fritz and magical ones to cease functioning the moment they were brought out. After the second &#039;energetic&#039; failure they&#039;d unanimously decided not to bring out anything else.</p><p class="double">They&#039;d debated for a while until Pinkie had apparently had enough and declared that she was going to go &#039;full chaos goddess&#039; and fix everything, and then throw a party for all of Equestria to help them recover. She&#039;d pulled out a lump of cosmic spectrum, one that Twilight insisted every member of the alicorn club carry ever since that Loop where the Smooze nullified the elements and by extension their preferred method of ascending, and focused. The magical stone had pulsed and then shattered into dust, Pinkie&#039;s eyes had rolled back in her head, foam formed at her mouth, and she began convulsing uncontrollably.</p><p class="double">It was exactly what had happened to Twilight back in the ballroom while their attention had been elsewhere. Down to the small pile of magically inert dust Rarity then realized must have been Twilight&#039;s own backup cosmic spectrum.</p><p class="double">After they&#039;d gotten Pinkie squared away, Spike had suggested that he scry with the Force and see if he could learn anything. Since it wasn&#039;t really magic, native to the Loop or otherwise, it shouldn&#039;t be affected by whatever had happened.</p><p class="double">Except that it was... somehow. Spike had been able to use the Force just fine, but the moment he opened his mind everything had gone wrong. He&#039;d gone limp and vacant before beginning to mutter nonsense, and he hadn&#039;t stopped since.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy had lost her temper about then and tried to wildshape and go flying off in a blind rage to find the one responsible, except... Well, Luna had been needed to undo the result and put Fluttershy back to rights. Applejack had readily agreed that further experimentation with non-native Loop abilities should be put on hold until they learned more.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;If only our best scholar in all things magic would wake up so we could get on that. Or if whoever did this would at least make themselves known so we can kick their flank and get on with things!&#039;</i> she sighed as she prepared to round an upcoming corner. <i>&#039;Honestly, I haven&#039;t felt this helpless since–&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;You need to tell them,&quot; Luna&#039;s voice shook the dressmaker out of her musings right before she rounded the corner. Many Loops of experience in cloak and dagger type scenarios prompted her to conceal herself as best as possible and eavesdrop.</p><p class="double">&quot;I will,&quot; the voice of Blues responded, &quot;eventually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is what I used to tell myself in regards to the jealousy I felt towards my sister,&quot; Luna retorted. &quot;I would tell myself that I&#039;d let her know how I felt &#039;soon&#039; and before I knew it I was blasting her through a wall in rage. You are tainted with the Nightmare just as I was. Its dark whispers will wear down your defenses as they did mine, until a dark parody of yourself is all that&#039;s left.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Well,&#039;</i> Rarity thought to herself, <i>&#039;that certainly explains why they weren&#039;t affected. Luna probably built up a tolerance from playing host for a thousand years and anyone currently infected is likely exempt from the effects. Which probably means little Nyx isn&#039;t affected either. Twilight will be happy to hear that. I guess my occasional stint as &#039;Nightmarity&#039; is why I can still use some of the basics too.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I can handle it,&quot; Blues insisted. &quot;I&#039;m not hearing whispers or words or anything. Just a barely perceptible prodding to act on some of my darker thoughts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that is how it starts,&quot; Luna returned just as stubbornly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been dealing with these thoughts for longer than most think,&quot; Blues retorted. &quot;The Nightmare isn&#039;t bringing anything new to the table.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For your sake, I hope not,&quot; Luna relented as a messenger ran up to the two with news.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora owed the Light family much, even if they would claim otherwise. She was not ignorant of the ways in which the world worked, and she had seen the suspicious looks the townsponies had thrown her when she&#039;d arrived years ago. They had never seen a zebra before, knew nothing about her ways or traditions, and they feared what was different and unfamiliar.</p><p class="double">Except Dr. Light. He looked at the strange and unfamiliar with interest and wonder. He didn’t look upon her setting up residence in the Everfree, a place rife with rare and potent ingredients for her potions and studies, as proof she was to be feared. No, he looked upon it with interest and sought to learn why. He came to her, braving the dangers of the Everfree, and sought to learn who she was and why she lived there.</p><p class="double">She knew he hadn&#039;t needed to do that. Nor did he need to accompany her into town and vouch for her to all of the vendors. He <i>certainly</i> hadn&#039;t needed to put in an order for regular potion supplies and pay her so well for them.</p><p class="double">And so, when the Nightmare had fallen over Equestria, she&#039;d wasted no time. Magic may have been stifled, but there was a potion known to her that would counter the effects of such a curse upon the drinker that could still be brewed by one under the dark influence. The primary downside was that the ingredients were not only rare but also dangerous to work with. Not to mention when improperly brewed, the potion was quite hazardous.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d had just enough for two doses. One for her to chase away the dark aches so the forest did not catch her unawares and one for the good doctor so he would be at his best.</p><p class="double">She hadn&#039;t expected him to already be at work on a solution though. It had made her efforts seem... pointless. At least at first. Even though they already had the makings of a solution, the doctors had jumped on her brew and gotten the griffon&#039;s toad-like robot, newly shielded and made to analyze and reproduce liquids, to duplicate her brew. If what they claimed was true, her contribution had cut several day&#039;s work down to one.</p><p class="double">And now they had come to Canterlot in the hopes they could restore the stallion&#039;s mechanical children, and any others who needed it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Thou art certain this shall work?&quot; Luna looked at the contraptions dubiously. &quot;As we understand it, artificially made potions are... magically inert.&quot;</p><p class="double">The princess of the night hoped she didn&#039;t look as ragged as she felt. Raising both the moon and sun, even if their light was stifled by the curse of darkness, was tiring enough. Dealing with Equestria in a crisis without her sister to help was taking its toll though.</p><p class="double">&quot;The process by which we make this brew, makes it impotent that is true,&quot; the zebra mare, Zecora if she recalled correctly, replied as she placed a hoof on the shoulder of a black metal alicorn. The one made from the remnants of the Nightmare energy that had corrupted her. &quot;But add the power of dark benign, and you will find it works just fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just put magic into it, that&#039;s all,&quot; The artificial alicorn filly looked like she would have blushed were she capable.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, magic&#039;s what we need to make it work, so you do a bang-up job, ribbit!&quot; the metal frog-thing, Rain Toad made by the griffon scientist Dr. Cossack as he had been introduced, chimed in. Some contraption originally meant to do the job of a pegasus by seeding rain during droughts, and adapted to analyze water composition and then reproduce it for later analysis. Currently adapted to mass produce Zecora&#039;s darkness protection potion.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re ready,&quot; Dr. Light announced as he finished activating the miraculously working cylinders. He&#039;d been busy it seemed adapting the chambers to work under this infernal curse and then getting his creations and his companion&#039;s running so they could haul them here. All to save his metal foals. That it could be used to cure ponies was a welcome addition, but Luna wanted to see it work first.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alrighty everypony!&quot; Applejack, bearer of Honesty, called to the others. &quot;Let&#039;s lower them two in nice and gentlelike!&quot;</p><p class="double">As Luna watched, the metallic saviors of Equestria two times over were lowered into the clear cylinders, hooked up to various devices that went way over Luna&#039;s head, and then submerged in the artificial potion over their heads.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re up Nyx,&quot; Rainbow Dash, the bearer of Loyalty, told the robot alicorn filly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; the named filly, and metal daughter of the bearer of Magic, stepped up and began infusing the liquid with her power.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rock came back online in a way that was much more familiar than he liked to admit.</p><p class="double">Submerged in a vat of liquid after being unexpectedly forced offline.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Damnit, I was </i>sure <i>we wouldn&#039;t have to deal with Ra Moon this Loop!&#039;</i> he cursed Equestria&#039;s current lack of a centralized database he could readily access. The Lanfront ruins didn&#039;t exist every Loop, and their existence was sometimes classified, but he&#039;d gotten used to knowing about the possibility in advance.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is most promising,&quot; he heard Luna muse as he was extracted from the tank by Guts Stallion and... was that an Equestrian variant of Ring Man? He looked like a griffon. Off to the side Roll was being helped out by Elec Mare and some sphinx-like version of Pharaoh Man. And... yep, that looked like the griffon Dr. Cossack over there with his niece Gilda and Rock&#039;s dad. Blues was giving him the &#039;we need to talk soon&#039; signal over by an equine Bright Man, his head-mounted bulb illuminating the room. And over there was a beaming Nyx with Zecora, some version of Toad Man, and what looked like Skull Man imagined as a zebra.</p><p class="double">It worked for him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ye must prepare to repeat this treatment immediately,&quot; the lunar princess continued. &quot;First the bearers so that we may possibly regain the Elements of Harmony to turn against this mysterious and dishonorable foe, and then my sister if possible.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess!&quot; a frantic guard scrambled inside. &quot;There is someone claiming responsibility for this catastrophe outside! He is demanding to speak with you and your &#039;champions&#039; immediately!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pray, tell us,&quot; Rock heard the titanium alloy in the princess&#039;s voice, &quot;what is the name of this brazen knave?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He calls himself Ahuizotl Terra,&quot; the guard responded.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Well,&#039;</i> Rock thought in shock, <i>&#039;that might be what Blues wanted to tell me.&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Applejack swore as she listened to this odd version of Ahuizotl gloat over what he&#039;d done. If she still had full control over her earthbending, she&#039;d have been happy to give the varmint a round of applause. Him and his giant green headdress right between a pair of granite applauders, eeyup.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t princess,&quot; she heard Rock warn Luna off from trying to vaporize the smug... whatever he was. &quot;He looks too confident. He&#039;s got something up his sleeve.&quot;</p><p class="double">The problem with her earthbending was that this shroud of darkness, or whatever it was, was interferin&#039; with her control. If she tried something it could easily be too weak and do nothin&#039; or too strong and turn him into a smear. And while the latter option was soundin&#039; better with every sound outta his smug mouth, her aim wasn&#039;t all that hot either at the moment. She could just as easily smash one a&#039; the ponies who&#039;d come to see what all the hullabaloo was about.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, come princess,&quot; Ahuizotl grinned in his blue and white regalia and red helmet that sported the massive green headdress. Had ta be enchanted the way he was flauntin&#039; it. &quot;You aren&#039;t... frightened, are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of thou?&quot; Luna scoffed. &quot;A coward who hides behind magical toys? Not at all. Thou art simply not worth sullying ourself over. Thou shalt face our champion instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, that sounds thrilling!&quot; Ahuizotl laughed. &quot;In fact, why not send two? In fact, I&#039;ll allow <i>three</i> if you can find that many who aren&#039;t crippled! It won&#039;t make any difference!&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna scowled at the pompous something-or-other while Applejack made a mental note to ask Twilight what his dang species was when she woke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry princess,&quot; Roll assured her. &quot;We can handle him.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; Luna began before turning back to Ahuizotl. &quot;If thou art so confident, ye shall not object to us bestowing a blessing upon our champions.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d have it no other way,&quot; the villain grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well,&quot; Luna nodded and lowered her horn to the two robots and whispered to them, low enough that Applejack had to strain to hear, as she cast a spell. &quot;This protection shall shield thee both from anything the foul miscreant can bring to bear. End this quickly so that we can restore peace to our little ponies&#039; lives.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We will,&quot; they both promised and strode out to meet their opponent.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Ahuizotl mused pleasantly as he rubbed his chin, &quot;since your dear princess is allowed to grant a boon to her champions it seems only fair that I begin this contest, wouldn&#039;t you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">The robot pony siblings looked at each other before replying together. &quot;If you must.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perfect,&quot; Ahuizotl&#039;s grin threatened to carve the top of his skull away from his body as his hand-tail thing, sporting some red glove gauntlet doohicky, rose up over his head and pointed two fingers at the duo. &quot;Spark Chaser.&quot;</p><p class="double">It was over in a horrifying instant. The lasers that fired forth punched straight through Luna&#039;s protection spell and their metal bodies. And then it <i>cornered in midair</i> to hit them again. And again. And again. The sparking and smoldering forms of the twin heroes of Equestria hit the ground before what had happened had finished registering for anypony watching.</p><p class="double">&quot;Victory!&quot; Ahuizotl laughed. &quot;And now you all see just how powerless you are against just <i>one</i> of our little group of Stars! Even the magic your precious alicorn princess is no match for our new strength!&quot; The monster chuckled sinisterly. &quot;And there&#039;s more of us. Surrender to the Age of Eternal Darkness. Or wither away slowly.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack noted that Luna looked darn near ready to charge the piece of trash regardless of the fact that he&#039;d carved through one of her best protection spells like it was made of warm butter. Hay, she was ready to join her.</p><p class="double"><u>But then the music started.</u> (13)</p><p class="double">Quiet at first, barely noticeable, but it slowly increased in volume. A somber melody came forth and Applejack found herself rooted in place as a familiar feeling washed over her.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Who the buck is triggerin&#039; a Heartsong </i>now<i>?!&#039;</i> she thought incredulously. Trying to break the spell of a heartsong was technically possible, but rarely ended well. <i>&#039;What, is the stinkin&#039; varmint gonna gloat ta music now?&#039;</i> And then she saw Rock and Roll begin to stand up. <i>&#039;You gotta be kiddin&#039; me... </i>They&#039;re <i>tha ones doing this?&#039;</i></p><p class="double">The impact of getting the last of their hooves under them coincided with a pulsing drumbeat that ended the instrumentals and Rock began to sing.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I think we&#039;ve played this song before</i></p><p class="double"><i>The melody is different, but I hear the drums of war.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Drum beats heralded the return of the instrumentals as Applejack realized what was happening as Roll stepped forward. Those two were trying to trigger a heartsong to turn this fight around... Was that even possible?</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;So it seems our mission is the same</i></p><p class="double"><i>What always ends in bloodshed, begins as just a game.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Applejack blinked at the somber tone of the song as the two robots prepared to sing together. That wasn&#039;t typical Equestrian heartsong material.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;History repeating...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Who do they call when villains need defeating?</i></p><p class="double"><i>History repeating...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Who do we call when we&#039;re broken and bleeding?&quot;</i></p><p class="double">It dawned on her that this must be something from their home Loop. They clearly had experience with music as well as fighting. Maybe they&#039;d had both at the same time before. But then Ahuizotl smiled and stepped forward. Chlorophyll... He was going to try and turn the heartsong against them...</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;What have we here, you two want to be the ones?</i></p><p class="double"><i>But what you must realize is... that you&#039;re the only ones!</i></p><p class="double"><i>So here we are, beginning a new age</i></p><p class="double"><i>Get the players set; it&#039;s time that war we wage.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Applejack watched, bound by the heartsong as a spectator, as Ahuizotl lowered his tail-hand and the laser gauntlet with it. The varmint was so confident he wasn&#039;t going to use his alicorn-busting superweapon. He was intendin&#039; to show them all that he could beat the heroes of Equestria with his bare limbs!</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;History repeated...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Who can they call with the heroes defeated?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Our dark story completed...</i></p><p class="double"><i>What hope will they have with you two deleted?&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Applejack grit her teeth as the instrumentals swelled in volume and then began to increase in pace. Faster and faster as the combatants stared each other down across the courtyard.</p><p class="double"><u>And when the music shifted</u>, they were off like shots. They met in the center, trading unarmed blows. Ahuizotl&#039;s fist cratered the marble as the twin heroes dodged and counterattacked. They moved so fluidly and struck so solidly that it would be hard to believe they had really been injured so badly if the wounds were not plainly visible.</p><p class="double">Ahuizotl swept the area around him and the two jumped clear and fired their weapons before Rock picked up the song again.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;We stand before a moment of truth,&quot;</i></p><p class="double">He sounded much more determined now. The feeling of sadness was gone, replaced by determination as Roll continued for him.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;With all Equestria&#039;s fate in our hooves.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">She had to smirk as Ahuizotl snarled at them and they sang together.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Today, the end begins...&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Then the villain smirked and began to try and twist the song again as the two charged him.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Come and let the battle be born</i></p><p class="double"><i>This war that we fight is a thundering storm</i></p><p class="double"><i>Today, the end begins...&quot;</i></p><p class="double">She saw Rock gritting his teeth as blows were exchanged again and he tried to wrest the flow of the song back.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;If it was up to me</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;d rewrite history</i></p><p class="double"><i>And change our destiny</i></p><p class="double"><i>One last time&quot;</i></p><p class="double">The two robots began peppering Ahuizotl with buster shots from range and staying out of his reach until he got frustrated and leapt at them. He missed, but the blow from his boosted strength created a shockwave that knocked them back anyway. They managed to land on their hooves and dug grooves into the ground and picked up the song before renewing their assault.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Betrayed our promise of peace</i></p><p class="double"><i>This is the last time we&#039;re the Mega Ponies</i></p><p class="double"><i>Today, we change the end&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Applejack noticed Ahuizotl getting frustrated at how this fight wasn&#039;t as easy as he&#039;d been expecting and he raised his tail-hand with the laser gauntlet again. It was clear he was intending to fry them completely, heartsong influence or no. She was about to try and shout a warning when Ahuizotl&#039;s gauntlet was struck by an energy blast out of nowhere and a red-armored earth pony with a shield, scarf, and shaded visor landed between the two heroes and joined the song.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Hey, Rock. My weapon is hot</i></p><p class="double"><i>It&#039;s time to throw down; Let&#039;s show what we got</i></p><p class="double"><i>Today, we change the end...&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Ahuizotl snarled in rage and pain as all three charged him again and rejoined the song in anger.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Now you listen to me!</i></p><p class="double"><i>You can&#039;t stop this story!</i></p><p class="double"><i>No changing destiny!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Not this time!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Blows were traded fast and furious, and Applejack noticed Ahuizotl&#039;s armor building up energy. Just as she realized he had another trick up his durned sleeve, a wave of energy burst forth from him flinging all three of his opponents back. Rock and Roll landed badly, but the red-armored pony, who had to be Blues she figured, had managed to block with his shield and land on his hooves.</p><p class="double">And strangely, Ahuizotl seemed to calm down suddenly and sang at Blues in an almost friendly manner.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Come now, why do you fight?</i></p><p class="double"><i>You know that only we are right!</i></p><p class="double"><i>They cannot win, they can only fall,</i></p><p class="double"><i>And no choice you can make will</i></p><p class="double"><i>Change that at all!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Blues glared back at the villain and didn&#039;t even miss a beat before retorting defiantly.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I know they can win, They’ve done it before</i></p><p class="double"><i>Now put up your dukes, and let&#039;s settle this score</i></p><p class="double"><i>One last time!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">As the two charged and clashed, Applejack heard the whispers rocket through the crowd like Rainbow Dash breeching the warp barrier. And as one, practically everyone reached the same conclusion and cheered:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;HE&#039;S THE PROTOTYPE MANE OF MEGA MANE!!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">And then she heard Luna of all ponies join the song.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;It shall be up to thee</i></p><p class="double"><i>To rewrite this story</i></p><p class="double"><i>And change thy destiny</i></p><p class="double"><i>One last time&quot;</i></p><p class="double">And Applejack found she couldn&#039;t help repeating that last line as Blues clobbered Ahuizotl with an uppercut from his shield, making him stagger back and clutch his face in pain.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;One last TIME!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Ahuizotl growled as he moved his hand and everyone could see his eye bleeding as he began singing again.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You can&#039;t stop this you&#039;ll see</i></p><p class="double"><i>You&#039;ll face our dark story</i></p><p class="double"><i>And meet your destiny</i></p><p class="double"><i>Come next time!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">And as the music began to draw itself out for the end of the heartsong, Ahuizotl was bathed in magical light as he prepared to teleport. But not before tossing out a farewell line.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Yes.. next time...&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as she came to in a vat of liquid.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Another Star Wars Loop starting in a bacta tank?&#039;</i> she thought groggily. <i>&#039;No, wait, I&#039;m awake with a small &#039;a&#039;, not a capital one. Last Loop&#039;s still on. Tree, my everything hurts.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome back to the land of the living miss Sparkle,&quot; an unfamiliar griffon in glasses and a labcoat greeted her.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked again as she was hoisted out of the tank by a semi-poofy-maned Pinkie and took stock of the unusually dark palace room, lit primarily by an equine robot with a bulb on his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can anypony tell me what&#039;s been going on?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">rDaring Do didn&#039;t look it, but she was frightened. Many would be surprised to find that this was a common state for her. After all, she&#039;d faced death traps, dastardly villains, and magical doomsday devices. Sometimes all in the same day. But like she always reminded herself, it wasn&#039;t the fearless who succeeded in life, it was those who could face their fear. And at <i>that</i> she had long practice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahuizotl isn&#039;t the only one of my old foes who has gained new power,&quot; she informed the gathered Elements. She&#039;d missed her arch nemesis&#039;s arrival and duel partly due to being tapped with locating quarters for the arrivals from Ponyville in the midst of near oversaturation of refugees in the palace. The group of fillies (and one griffon chick) &#039;helping&#039; hadn&#039;t sped the process up any.</p><p class="double">Daring still had no idea where the tree sap had come from.</p><p class="double">&quot;Blues and I counted no less than eight other faces familiar to me from my past adventures as well. Each with their own new enchanted regalia and self-proclaimed titles. If you would please, doctor?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, Daring,&quot; Dr. Cossack adjusted his glasses with a talon as he motioned for his light-bulb themed robot, Bright Mane, to operate the projector. A pegasus mare in cult attire appeared on the screen.</p><p class="double">&quot;For those of you who don&#039;t know,&quot; Daring began, &quot;this is Desert Rose, an alternate version of a good friend of mine and the leader of a former cult whose purpose was to ressurrect the Smooze.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a sharp intake of breath from Princess Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid the news doesn&#039;t necessarily get better from there, Princess,&quot; Daring told the lunar diarch as the image shifted to show a different image of the same mare. Only this time she had an acid green coat color as well as a pink chestplate and helmet connected by a pair of tubes and her coat looked rubbery. Or gooey. &quot;She was supposedly killed by the very Smooze she sought to control, dissolved into its mass, but apparently she merged with it instead and... yes, miss Pie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why would anypony want to do anything with Smooze?&quot; the pink mare put down the hoof she&#039;d been frantically waving while going &#039;ooh! ooh! ooh! pick me!&#039;. &quot;It&#039;s like no fun at all! It&#039;s negative fun! Heck, I&#039;d go as far as to say it&#039;s anti-fun!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Honestly,&quot; Daring replied with a roll of her eyes, &quot;I&#039;d guess that every member of this group has something against others having fun. They&#039;re not exactly a nice bunch. Desert Mercury, as she has now chosen to call herself, is just the tip of this iceberg.&quot;</p><p class="double">The slide changed to show a zebra mare and this time it was Zecora who hissed.</p><p class="double">&quot;By my righteous burning fury,&quot; the potionmaker growled angrily, &quot;is that the ever hated Zuri?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know her?&quot; Daring blinked in surprise.</p><p class="double">&quot;Only of the traitor do I know,&quot; Zecora admitted, &quot;but home her face she dares not show. Foul betrayals she once committed and forever her name is now omitted.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Complete erasure from Zebrican records?&quot; Luna looked astonished. &quot;That is a punishment most extreme! Even our actions as Nightmare Moon did not warrant being wiped from living memory! What villainy didst she commit to deserve such a fate?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever it was,&quot; Daring replied as the slide switched to show the same zebra mare in yellow crab-like armor, &quot;I suspect it was for money. She&#039;s Ahuizotl&#039;s favorite mercenary. She now goes by Zuri Venus and whatever power her armor gives her, it&#039;s explosive. Then there&#039;s this fellow.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the image of a red dragon appeared, Luna rose in fury. <b>&quot;</b><i><b>That</b></i><i> </i><i><b>foul miscreant hath escaped his eternal bonds?!&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">&quot;Sadly, yes,&quot; Daring, like most of the room, rubbed her ears. &quot;I thought you might remember the time Inti tried to steal the power of Nightmare Moon before your return. Unfortunately, it seems that with your restoration the dark power you used to imprison him was similarly undone. He&#039;s going by Inti Mars now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The image changed to the same dragon in heavy armor mounted with cannons. One was mounted on hos head, one each on his forelimbs, and the shoulder pauldrons appeared to have several. He was a living war machine. While the room took that image in, the slide changed to a menacing-looking griffon. The kind who made Gilda at her worst look cute and cuddly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is that <i>Copperbeak</i>?&quot; Rainbow Dash gulped. The villain of Daring Do and the Griffon&#039;s Goblet had been one of the scarier ones in her opinion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Daring nodded as the image changed to show the griffon clad in green and yellow armor crackling with electricity. &quot;Copperbeak Jupiter is the sky commander of this group and his armor has power over storms. Even if pegasus magic wasn&#039;t being shut down by the dark curse over Equestria, Copperbeak would be able to overpower any pegasi&#039;s control over the weather. I&#039;m sorry, but even though the doctors&#039; treatment restores the ability to use magic, I doubt any of us will have the raw strength to wrest control of his storms from him. As Ahuizotl&#039;s demonstration showed, their powers are alicorn tier.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There are still other options,&quot; Dr. Cossack interjected. &quot;While we may lack raw power, we have other resources. I&#039;ll be happy to go over them with you all once Daring has finished her briefing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you doctor,&quot; Daring nodded as the image changed to show a bipedal tiger thing. A Rakshasa. &quot;Anyway, this is Khara, a rakshasa who previously kidnapped elephants to feed on their pain and misery. Not a nice fellow, especially now he&#039;s been upgraded.&quot;</p><p class="double">The image shifted to show the same being in brown armor with ring-like weapon so large he was standing in the middle of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;As Khara Saturn, he has even more terrifying powers than before and I didn&#039;t exactly stick around long enough to figure out what they were exactly,&quot; Daring admitted as the image switched to a positively immense minotaur. &quot;Moving on, this guy is formerly known as the insane King Hammerhoof. And another foe I&#039;d thought was dead. He looks like this now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The image of the minotaur clad in red and yellow armor so thick as to double his body mass appeared.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good gracious!&quot; Rarity gasped. &quot;And I thought he looked like a brute before!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Brute is right,&quot; Blues answered for Daring this time. &quot;That armor boosts his strength to unbelievable levels as Hammerhoof Uranus. When Daring was getting me out of there he tried to crush us with a several hundred tons of stone structures. Fortunately his aim is terrible.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that it&#039;ll make a difference if he gets his hands on you,&quot; Daring reminded the group as the image changed to show a diamond dog. &quot;This is Commandant Rex, a militant diamond dog who used to run a very successful slave trade.&quot; The image changed to show him in white fur garb with claw-like weapons at his wrists. &quot;Now going by Pluto Rex, he&#039;s more dangerous than ever.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He looks so cruel...&quot; Fluttershy teared up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Up next is this bastard,&quot; Daring ignored the emotional pegasus as the image of a sea pony with a scraggly beard and pirate attire came up. As Applejack yelped and dove under the table, the rest noted that he seemed oddly transparent. &quot;This guy is the formerly deceased pirate Blackmane, now Blackmane Neptune.&quot; The image changed to a definitely corporeal entity in blue and green armor with large white fins. &quot;Among the other abilities his new armor grants him, he also apparently has a fully living body. Or at least a reasonable facsimile.&quot; (14)</p><p class="double">&quot;And we all know the next member of this group,&quot; Blues continued as the picture of the thing that had dueled he and his siblings not even an hour prior appeared. &quot;Ahuizotl, now going by Ahuizotl Terra. One of the more persistent and prolific villains in the world with a penchant for seeking out mystical artifacts of power to aid his delusions of conquest. But even worse is who he seems to have recruited for his latest scheme.&quot;</p><p class="double">The image of Dr. Wily appeared, causing a round of nods from some and winces from others.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dr. Wily Plan has proved to be an Equestria-wide threat with nothing more than his own intelligence and inventions before,&quot; Blues reminded the group. &quot;And now he&#039;s enhancing a group of alicorn-level villains with that same warped genius to unknown ends. Ends involving the phrase &#039;Eternal Night&#039; and this:&quot;</p><p class="double">The image was now a giant black orb with red markings that made it look like a closed eye.</p><p class="double">&quot;The artifact of Le Mu, or Ra Moon according to some translations,&quot; Daring took over. &quot;Housed in the Lanfront ruins, ancient texts believe it to be the source of dark magic. Thanks to Blues I can now confirm that this artifact is the source of the Nightmare Force that once corrupted Princess Luna and now fuels the curse of darkness that shrouds Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Order, order!&quot; Twilight proclaimed as she presided over the meeting of loopers. Celestia had been treated, but instead of recovering completely the solar princess was barely conscious. She was weak and constantly tired to the point where staying awake was a feat in and of itself. Luna was currently doing her best to get Celestia back to as much health as possible. Dash had been taken care of rather fortuitously when Daring had asked her about her work at Light Labs and Gilda had tagged along to catch up on old times. The three had last been seen deep in energetic conversation with no end in sight. As for the doctors, they had tapped the expanded crusaders (Kalinka apparently having been inducted at some point) to help distribute the cure to the guard, which left the loopers to their own devices.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, honestly Twilight,&quot; Rarity rolled her eyes in exasperation. &quot;We&#039;re all here and hanging on your every word. There&#039;s no need to call us to order.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think she just likes saying it,&quot; Pinkie chirped as she idly tried to get her mane back to its normal poofiness. &quot;Kinda like you still use that couch of yours even though–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have no idea what you&#039;re talking about,&quot; Rarity sniffed. She was still feeling a little out of sorts. Spike hadn&#039;t responded to the treatment as well as the rest. Sure being unconscious was technically an improvement over the delirious ramblings he&#039;d been on since opening his mind to the Force had been warped by the curse, but he was still not back to normal. She&#039;d gone Loops without her husband Awake before, but having him here but incapacitated was just... worse somehow. To be so close yet so far...</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, whatever,&quot; Applejack huffed. &quot;Let&#039;s just get on with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine,&quot; Twilight huffed as Rock and Roll grinned and Blues smirked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You seem happy,&quot; Fluttershy whispered as Twilight shuffled her notes and prepared to speak.</p><p class="double">&quot;You just seem like really good friends is all,&quot; Roll smiled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Twilight declared. &quot;To recap: Thanks to the doctors and Zecora, we have our magic back, but not all of it. Our non-Loop native abilities are also sort of working again as Applejack kindly tested out, but our power levels are still not a hundred percent. Essentially, we&#039;re all back to the upper end of baseline for us rather than the accumulated power we&#039;ve become used to. Ascending to alicorn is currently not an option. Whatever this curse is, it really doesn&#039;t like alicorns. Celestia&#039;s current state after anti-curse treatment is proof enough of that. In addition, the Elements themselves are inert for the foreseeable future, removing that option as well. And if that wasn&#039;t enough, pretty much anything useful in our subspace pockets is rendered technologically and magically inert, or worse, the moment we remove it so we can&#039;t count on any of <i>that</i> either.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn Anchor took a deep breath before continuing. &quot;According to Rock and Roll, the foes from their Loop being emulated are called the Stardroids and each is incredibly powerful. Enough to possibly give us a run for our money even if we were at full strength. On our side of the equation, each member of the group is a foe of Daring Do from her adventures which could be real or fictional depending on the variant. They&#039;re all highly ruthless and very dangerous. Rock, if you would please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem,&quot; the newly repaired robot agreed as he took the floor. &quot;In our Loop, Ra Moon is an alien supercomputer dedicated to wiping out all life on the planet to pave the way for its &#039;children&#039;, the Stardroids. It&#039;s one of the less pleasant events we go through but fortunately it doesn&#039;t happen every Loop. We did our best to check for indicators that it existed, but we didn&#039;t find any until now. Anyway, the current variant appears to be an ancient artifact to fuel &#039;Eternal Night&#039; and Blues says there&#039;s no indication it has any form of awareness. The ultimate goal is to enter the Lanfront ruins and destroy the artifact. As it&#039;s the source for the dark shroud over Equestria, that should remove its influence and restore magic to all of Equestria, including the Elements of Harmony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Assuming there are no complications,&quot; Blues added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Complications?&quot; Twilight cocked her head inquisitively. &quot;Like what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like Sunstar,&quot; Rock intoned as Roll nodded gravely. &quot;He&#039;s normally the true leader of the Stardroids and a doomsday weapon that we can never get around fighting. The only good news is that &#039;Eternal Night&#039; really doesn&#039;t fit his style, so we may not have to face a version of him.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, here&#039;s hopin&#039;,&quot; Applejack voiced what the rest were thinking.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Sister.....&quot; Celestia wheezed from her bed as various ponies fussed over her. &quot;You can....... not be............. serious...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We have never been more serious, dear sister,&quot; Luna insisted gently. &quot;This foul magic is an attack not only on Equestria and her sovereignty, but upon all the world as well. Magic has been stripped from the populace and the land. Most all fantastic technological advances made since our banishment lie inert. The Elements of Harmony themselves hath been rendered dormant. We cannot in good conscience send our little ponies to face this threat when we ourselves are unwilling to go.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eques...tria...... needs.......you,&quot; Celestia coughed. &quot;Our..... little...... ponies need.... their... princess of the night.......... to lead them.... in dark times..........&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Our little ponies need the sun,&quot; Luna nuzzled her bedridden sister affectionately. &quot;They need an end to the darkness. And we shall see it done.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Even protected from the dark influence of the shroud that emanates from it, and before these &#039;Star Druids&#039; are taken into account, the Lanfront ruins are a dangerous place,&quot; Dr. Cossack explained to the task force that had been assembled for the purpose of infiltrating the ruins and taking out the source of the dark curse over the land. In addition to the Elements of Harmony, Daring Do, and the Light siblings; Zecora and Gilda had volunteered to join the expedition. He&nbsp;&nbsp;wasn&#039;t particularly happy about his niece going to fight opponents who could apparently cut through alicorn magic with little effort, but he couldn&#039;t reasonably stop her.</p><p class="double">He could, however, send help.</p><p class="double">&quot;Which is why Dr. Light and I have enhanced my series of robot masters to strengthen this group,&quot; he continued. &quot;Each of you will be paired with one of them. The mission is to engage the various StarDruids and keep them occupied while Daring Do and the Lights infiltrate the ruins and destroy the artifact of Le Mu. I&#039;ve put together teams to best compliment each pair&#039;s individual abilities. Miss Pie, you are with–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rain Toad!&quot; Pinkie interrupted cheerfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, actual–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gotta be him!&quot; Pinkie cut the griffon doctor off again.</p><p class="double">&quot;.....May I ask why?&quot; Dr. Cossack sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because if I&#039;m gonna rain on their parade, I should have somefrog who can use actual rain!&quot; Pinkie smiled. (*)</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just go with it,&quot; Twilight told him. &quot;Knowing Pinkie, it&#039;ll all work out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But...&quot; the griffon scratched his head, &quot;then who shall I pair up Zecora with?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your robot with the skeleton mane, shall suit me better than the rain,&quot; Zecora informed him, before smirking. &quot;It shall be good voodoo that we do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah...&quot; the griffon scientist looked even more lost. &quot;I was going to have him protect Fluttershy. And I still have no one to pair with Dust Bunny.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A BUNNY?!&quot; the sudden yell caused everyone present to turn and look at a now blushing Fluttershy. &quot;Er..... I mean, I&#039;ll volunteer to go with him. If that&#039;s okay with you...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... suppose that works out then,&quot; Dr. Cossack adjusted his glasses. &quot;Moving on... Applejack, I understand your connection with the Elements has allowed you to develop earth moving powers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Somethin&#039; like that,&quot; Applejack carefully didn&#039;t reveal where she&#039;d <i>really</i> gotten such abilities from.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Cossack nodded, &quot;that will make you a good partner for my tunnelling model, Drill Dog. I understand miss Rarity has an affinity for enchantments and gemstones?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And fabulousness darling, don&#039;t forget that,&quot; the unicorn looper winked to let the room know she was trying to lighten the mood.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; the griffon nodded. &quot;Well, Bright Mane should help you dazzle and daze your opponents. Rainbow Dash, my niece tells me you&#039;re quite the flyer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Best in Equestria!&quot; Dash boasted.</p><p class="double">&quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; Dr. Cossack smirked. &quot;Regardless, she also tells me that you&#039;re an accomplished martial artist. Thus you&#039;ll be paired with Ring Tercel, my contribution to the Griffon Empire&#039;s National Guard. You will be the primary combat pair. While all of you will likely be engaged with the StarDruids in combat, the two of you will be the ones most up close and personal. Hit hard, hit fast, and get the buck back out of range before they can retaliate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; Dash saluted seriously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, you and Dive Serpent with his homing munitions will be long range support,&quot; Dr. Cossack continued, getting a nod from the unicorn. &quot;Which brings me to the last pair.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You better not have me sidelined uncle,&quot; Gilda growled indignantly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Far from it, my dear Gilda,&quot; Cossack sighed. &quot;You and Pharaoh Sphinx have perhaps the most dangerous job of all. While the rest draw out the StarDruids, you will be following the main strike team in for the purpose of engaging any remaining defenses while they continue on ahead. It will be only the two of you against whatever remaining opposition there is so the strike team isn&#039;t delayed, with no chance for backup.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda swallowed a bit nervously, but managed a salute in reply.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rock, Roll, Blues,&quot; Cossack addressed the Lights, &quot;your father and I managed to cobble together an upgrade for your copy chips. You should be able to replicate, at least partially, the enchantments on the StarDruids&#039; regalias in addition to an expanded active weapon memory and the master weapons of my own creations. Hopefully, this will give you any extra edge needed. Your father&#039;s reactivated creations will be staying behind to protect Canterlot along with the Equestrian Royal Guard in case the StarDruids attack here. I only wish we could afford to send more help. These are, after all, enemies with strength comparable to an alicorn each.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You may not, noble doctor, but we shall,&quot; the regal voice of Princess Luna joined the group. &quot;If these blackguards bring strength equal to the alicorn race, then ye too shall have the strength of an alicorn to aid ye! Your princess of the night is joining you to put an end to this curse of lightlessness!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, so you&#039;ve heard about this &#039;Le Mu&#039; thing before?&quot; Rainbow Dash inquired of the princess as the group rode the royal air yacht to the Lanfront ruins.</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed we have,&quot; Luna admitted, &quot;though the tale was ancient when we and our sister were but fillies ourselves and we thought it nothing more than an old tale to frighten young ones. It appears that is not the case.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know,&quot; Twilight mused as she examined her Loop memories more closely, &quot;I think I came across the legend myself once. Something about the first alicorn?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Luna replied as the others, of flesh and steel alike, gathered around her to hear the tale. &quot;Le Tor was his name and for thousands of years the tellings of his deeds caused the alicorn race to be viewed as cursed. It was only when Celestia and ourself vanquished the spirit of chaos with the Elements of Harmony that opinion shifted.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rock and Roll in particular listened closely. If Le Mu was the current variant of Ra Moon, then Le Tor was obviously meant to be Ra Thor. A super robot who had never had a personality that they&#039;d encountered. It would be interesting to hear how he had been different this time.</p><p class="double">&quot;It is said that Le Tor was once a noble and just ruler over all ponykind in the ancient past, even before magic was well understood or the rift between the three tribes formed,&quot; Luna began. &quot;But he grew greedy and selfish and his heart turned to darkness. He delved into dark magics and became cruel and unforgiving, forged armor of terrible dark power to wear, and eventually created the artifact of Le Mu and used it to imprison the sun. The entire world was seemingly cast into darkness eternal until, as the legends say, an order of unicorns known as the Magi came together to pool their mystical abilities and raise the sun by sheer force of will.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened to the bastard then?&quot; Gilda asked, intrigued.</p><p class="double">&quot;The legends say that the Magi then led all three tribes and chased the wicked alicorn out of their lands by force, the might of the unicorn order rendering his dark powers useless. He fled with the artifact of Le Mu to a distant land never to be seen again. And the ponies, thankful for the return of the life-giving sun, made the unicorn order their rulers. The pegasi swore to their defense and the earth ponies to the production of their food so the unicorns could forever focus on maintaining the cycle of days. And of course, the tale of Hearth&#039;s Warming tells us how that eventually worked out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Twilight turned that over in her mind. It sounded a little off in some respects and she wondered if the unicorn nobles of the time had... tailored the tale to inflate their own sense of importance. But it would be impossible to know for sure.</p><p class="double">-----</p><p class="double">&quot;Heeheehee!&quot; Desert Mercury cackled as she saw the Equestrian airship in the distance. &quot;Looks like the doc was right. They <i>are</i> foolish enough to come right to us!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;More fools them,&quot; Zuri Venus scowled intently. &quot;Copperbeak? You&#039;re up.&quot; (16)</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh-heh-heh...&quot; the armored griffon chuckled as he rubbed his gauntlets together, electricity sparking between them as storm clouds formed in the sky around the airship. &quot;This is gonna be fun... And Venus? Call me Jupiter.&quot;</p><p class="double">A massive bolt of lightning split the sky and the ship, sending it to the ground in a flaming wreck.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Pluto Rex grinned. &quot;I&#039;m sure a few of them survived that. Let&#039;s go hunting.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Smash them all!&quot; Hammerhoof Uranus agreed enthusiastically.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Inti Mars rumbled in anticipation. &quot;It has been too long since I had decent sport.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ye and me both landlubber,&quot; Blackmane Neptune smirked from the river.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Is everyone okay?&quot; Rock and Twilight asked at the same time. The storm had come up unnaturally quick, making it an obvious attack. However, while most had believed that it was meant to aid incoming hostiles, and had thus gone on watch for them, Princess Luna had divined that the storm was, in fact, the main attack and had teleported the entire group to the ground and out of harm&#039;s way before the air yacht was destroyed.</p><p class="double">&quot;A little shaken sugarcubes,&quot; Applejack replied from where she was scanning the surrounding area.</p><p class="double">&quot;But not stirred!&quot; Pinkie grinned despite the fact that not everyone present got the reference and even fewer appreciated its use at the moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tis not the time for frivolity,&quot; Luna admonished the Element of Laughter. &quot;Our foes shall not believe us so easily dispatched. We must make haste to our goal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We need to spread out,&quot; Gilda told them. &quot;Big groups are big targets and we&#039;re probably not gonna have much warning when they find us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gilda&#039;s right,&quot; Rainbow agreed. &quot;Strength in numbers isn&#039;t gonna mean much when they can toss around big moves like that one. We need to pair off and split up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Keep your communicators hot,&quot; Blues added, tapping his helmet and reminding the non-robots present of the devices fitted to their ears. &quot;Contact the rest if you engage the StarDruids. Do your best to take them out one by one and keep the way clear for the strike team. Luna, you&#039;re with Rock and Roll in Strike 1. We&#039;re probably going to need you against whatever&#039;s waiting for us in there. Daring and I will be close by as Strike 2 with Gilda and Pharaoh Sphinx covering us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Everyone got your partners?&quot; Roll checked, getting a round of nods.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then let&#039;s move out!&quot; Rock declared and began galloping towards the Lanfront ruins.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dr. Wily cackled as he observed the view of Canterlot in his video feed. Ahuizotl had been sent back from the seat of Equestrian government with his scorched hand-tail between his legs despite his gloating that he could conquer the city on his own in its weakened state.</p><p class="double">Wily, however, knew that his old friend and colleague would have been able to work something out. That&#039;s what Bright Light (and why did some part of his mind want to call the stallion Thomas? What a strange name...) did after all. So he&#039;d joined in the bet the rest had done over how Ahuizotl would fail, the prize being command of the next phase of the plan. Inti bet he&#039;d lose to Luna, Zuri had wagered he&#039;d fall to Daring as was usual for him, Copperbeak had bet on a timely griffon intervention, Rex claimed the guards would emerge victorious though with losses, Hammerhoof had bet on the longshot of the royal guard with no losses, Blackmane insisted on the slightly less longshot of a ragtag bunch of misfits, Khara thought he&#039;d somehow manage to do himself in, and Desert believed that the Equestrians would whip out some forgotten and forbidden dark magic. But he&#039;d won by wagering that Dr. Light&#039;s creations would be Ahuizotl&#039;s undoing on that errand. After all, he knew firsthoof how capable they were.</p><p class="double">It was why he&#039;d insisted on restoring and enhancing the armors and regalias that had been found here. The ingenuity of the ancient order that had made them was astounding, make no mistake, but it was nothing he couldn&#039;t improve upon.</p><p class="double">Even if he&#039;d needed a little help from the master artifact to do it.</p><p class="double">In any case, he had a genius plan. The nine outfitted members would remain at the ruins to meet the forces that would be sent against them. While he? He would send his latest and greatest project, an artifact at least as ancient and powerful as anything his nine partners now wielded that he had restored and improved upon, back to Canterlot while its most capable champions were away. All under his direct control.</p><p class="double">Should these &#039;heroes&#039; defeat their group, he would already have the ultimate collection of hostages to secure their unconditional surrender.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna nearly forgot the plan when the dragon, Inti Mars, burst out of the treeline, scattering several trees with his size. But when her two companions, rather than stand and fight, merely dashed past the beast (17) she recalled their words:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;We can&#039;t stop to engage unless there&#039;s no other choice. I know you&#039;ll want to protect the others from danger. We will too. But there&#039;s a time for protecting others and a time to realize others are capable of protecting themselves. This is the latter. So we don&#039;t stop unless there&#039;s no other choice.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Cowards!&quot; the war dragon yelled after them as they raced away from him. &quot;Come back and face me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold it right there, mister!&quot; the stern voice of Fluttershy could be heard behind them before the three were too far away to make out words.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie and Rain Toad were advancing through the jungle when a blast of energy tore through Pinkie&#039;s mane. Strangely, it didn&#039;t seem to do any harm. Instead it grabbed one of her party petards that she always kept handy and carried it back to the shooter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, well,&quot; the shooter&#039;s sinister voice made itself known, &quot;if it isn&#039;t the ever-so-happy Element of Laughter. I was hoping I&#039;d run into you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Pinkie asked cheerfully as Desert Mercury stepped into her view. &quot;Did you want a party? I&#039;m kind of busy right now, but I think I can squeeze you in for a quick small one!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I hate parties,&quot; Desert Mercury punctuated the statement by crushing the party munitions she&#039;d stolen with her weapon.</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s mane almost deflated again as her shock broke her concentration. &quot;W-what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You heard me,&quot; the acid green mare glared at Equestria&#039;s premier party pony. &quot;I hate parties. I hate laughter. I hate seeing the clueless brain-dead masses happy go about their happy way. Why do you think I wanted to revive the Smooze? So I could erase that inane pointless happiness once and for all!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie took a step at the insane look in the armored mare&#039;s eyes and bumped into her companion. Turning to look at him, she saw him nod reassuringly. He had her back, no matter what.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now I <i>am</i> the Smooze!&quot; Desert Mercury laughed as her body rippled and flowed menacingly. &quot;And I will destroy all happiness!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Ringer, hold up,&quot; Rainbow told her wing-bot. &quot;I know we&#039;re supposed to support the others, but that storm cloud&#039;s not sitting right by me. I think we should make it our priority.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The idea is sound,&quot; Ring Tercel allowed before pointing at a figure in the sky, revealed only by the lightning. &quot;But what about the storm&#039;s master?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Rainbow mused for a moment. &quot;Okay, here&#039;s the plan...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Come on out and I&#039;ll make this quick!&quot; Zuri called to her hidden quarry as she stalked ever closer. &quot;Honestly, it&#039;s nothing personal, but you shouldn&#039;t have involved yourself in things like this that are way over your heads.&quot;</p><p class="double">The brush rustled a bit and she smirked.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now you&#039;re going to lose them,&quot; the zebra mercenary smirked as she unleashed the exploding bubbles her armor&#039;s magic allowed her to create.</p><p class="double">The brush blew apart impressively as expected, but there was a distinct lack of remains left behind.</p><p class="double">&quot;That is how you track one like me?&quot; the metered voice of a shaman mare taunted from behind her. &quot;Who lives in the forest ever free?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Zuri retorted in a low voice, trying to hide the innate fear that revelation instilled in her, &quot;they sent a medicine mare after me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nay,&quot; the unfamiliar zebra replied as she stepped from the brush, &quot;you were punished for your crime. To seek you out is not worth my time. But the reality now is stark. The world chafes under eternal dark.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sanctimonious holier than thou...&quot; the mercenary growled.</p><p class="double">&quot;It matters not who is wrong or right,&quot; the zebra replied calmly. &quot;We must purge the dark and return the light.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll purge <i>you</i>!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight, by virtue of her aquatic companion, had taken the river.</p><p class="double">&quot;Avast ye weakling bilge rats!&quot;</p><p class="double">As should have been expected, they were stopped by the aquatic member of their opponents.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hate pirates,&quot; Twilight grumbled as she and Dive Serpent prepared to face off against Blackmane Neptune.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can&#039;t say I&#039;m all that fond of them me&#039;self lass,&quot; the robotic river serpent agreed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hammerhoof Uranus bellowed as he pried his helmet off of his face and back atop his head. The blue robot pony would pay for that humiliation! Turning frantically to seek his opponent, he spotted him nearby and charged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tarnation!&quot; The pony in question wasn&#039;t blue. Nor a robot. Heck, she wasn&#039;t even male.</p><p class="double">The enraged and empowered minotaur really didn&#039;t care at this point.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, well,&quot; Pluto Rex grinned as he traced a claw over the captured unicorn&#039;s face, &quot;aren&#039;t you a pretty pony? Yes, you&#039;ll fetch a fine price when this is over.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why do I always attract the unwashed brutes?&quot; Rarity sighed to herself, trying to not think about the unclean feeling.</p><p class="double">&quot;Insult me all you want, pretty pony,&quot; the diamond dog grinned sadistically, &quot;you&#039;ll change your tune soon enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh!&quot; Rarity spat and closed here eyes. &quot;I don&#039;t think so. Any time Bright Mane!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And just what do you think your useless companion can do?&quot; Pluto Rex taunted, before promptly being blinded by a bright flash of light.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, nothing much,&quot; Rarity simpered condescendingly as her opponent howled and clutched his eyes. Honestly, what did he expect with eyes so adjusted to darkness meeting the brightest bulb in all the lands?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Blues cursed under his breath as he grappled with Khara Saturn. The Rakshasa had ambushed them as they drew close to the ruins and knocked Daring to the ground. Even the fact that he&#039;d copied the felinoid&#039;s weapon wasn&#039;t improving his mood. The felinoid was strong and had all the leverage right now, which meant Blues was in a bad position.</p><p class="double">And then all of a sudden the weight of his opponent was slammed off of him. Turning to look, he saw Gilda roll off of Khara Saturn right as Pharaoh Sphinx unleashed a charged Pharaoh Shot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Go!&quot; Gilda called to him and Daring, who was now returning to her feet, &quot;we&#039;ve got this loser!&quot;</p><p class="double">Blues simply nodded and ran for the entrance to the ruins, Daring close behind him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ahuizotl Terra grinned as he watched the three intrepid explorers pass by without noticing him. He wasn&#039;t going to engage them. No, he had a score to settle with the red one who was even now approaching as well. And an older score to settle with the hated Daring Do with him.</p><p class="double">These three he&#039;d let the doctor deal with.</p><p class="double">Humming cheerfully to himself, he pulled a lever that caused a wall to slide closed behind the three. Now they couldn&#039;t return to interfere, and Daring and the red one could proceed no further.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dr. Wily scowled as he saw Ahuizotl let his nemeses and the princess through his checkpoint. It was... not unexpected to be honest. Far from ideal, but not unexpected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, my brain damaged friend,&quot; he addressed a special variant of his Devil Core, &quot;it looks like you will get to have revenge on one of the ones responsible for your state after all.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Devil Core was constructed around the most fascinating magical artifact. One that could summon an otherwise bodiless presence to be interrogated. And with his improvements and melding with his Devil Series technology, the presence would have both a body and the ability to defend against intruders.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, you shall have your revenge...&quot; he chuckled. &quot;You shall have revenge for both of us.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s blood ran cold as her captain of the guard used his newly restored magic and displayed an image of the figure approaching Canterlot. It was tall, taller than her, covered in armor over every inch of its body, and most tellingly of all it was an alicorn.</p><p class="double">One she recognized from the stories and legends her mother used to tell her and Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;It... <i>can&#039;t</i>...... be........&quot; she gasped out. But her eyes, tired as they were, told her otherwise.</p><p class="double">The legendary first alicorn, Le Tor, the evil being who had once imprisoned the sun, a figure that had featured prominently in her foalhood nightmares since the day she earned her cutie mark, was advancing on Canterlot.</p><p class="double">On her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rock and Roll had jumped when the section of wall slammed closed behind them, honestly expecting that they&#039;d accidentally tripped a trap of some sort. Even with long experience raiding the Lanfront in their baseline, they still tended to miss some of those things every so often.</p><p class="double">&quot;T&#039;would appear our regress is barred to us,&quot; Luna observed as she finished scanning the wall. &quot;It is no matter as our goal lies ahead and not behind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;True,&quot; Rock allowed, though in his experience having exits barred always meant something nasty was ahead.</p><p class="double">And as they entered the next chamber, he wasn&#039;t disappointed.</p><p class="double">There before them was a Devil Core, etched in runes that first began to glow and then emit black smoke that positively pulsed with dark magic. As the mystic smoke began to form the standard body shape for the Devil Series, Rock reflected that this was the first version he&#039;d seen that had a gaseous body. The body finished forming and the eye opened menacingly...</p><p class="double">And Princess Luna gasped in shock at its appearance.</p><p class="double">The single eye had a sickly green sclera, an angry red iris, and a sinister purple aura that seemed to bleed power from the eyeball itself. <b>&quot;Crrr....rrry....yyss...sstt....taa.....aal...lss....?&quot;</b> the thing rumbled slowly and unsurely.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sombra.....?&quot; Luna whispered in recognition and disbelief. &quot;Sombra DarkMoon? How?&quot;</p><p class="double">The evil eye then focused on Luna and the beast seemed to gain a measure of clarity.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;LLLUUNNAAAA!!!!&quot;</b> It roared with hate and rage.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Inti Mars was utterly flummoxed. He was used to ponies and other small creatures either cowering in terror or engaging him in battle. He wasn&#039;t used to small winged soft-looking ponies trying to stare him into submission as if he was an unruly hatchling.</p><p class="double">The strange creature next to the pony that looked like the union of a rabbit and a vacuum cleaner wasn&#039;t even a contestant in how unnerving the experience was.</p><p class="double">&quot;You should be ashamed of yourself!&quot; the pony scolded him. &quot;Just because you&#039;re bigger than everyone else is no excuse to bully them! What would your mother think?&quot;</p><p class="double">That last part snapped him out of it. The reference to his <i>mother</i>… (18)</p><p class="double">&quot;My <i>mother</i>...&quot; he growled at the pony, who seemed surprised that he was acting like the grand dragon he was rather than a mere stripling she was treating him as, &quot;was a vile old <i>lizard</i>. And my only regret...&quot;</p><p class="double">The pony took an instinctive step back as the cannons the mad doctor pony had added to his magic armor began to glow with power.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Is that I didn&#039;t kill her myself!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zuri Venus brayed in fury. The shaman&#039;s illusions were infuriating! She&#039;d thought her power had obliterated the uppity zebra mare the second time, only to see the tell-tale magical mist float away instead of a mangled body as the dust settled. Same with the third, and then the fourth, and so on.</p><p class="double">&quot;Show yourself!&quot; the empowered mercenary screeched.</p><p class="double">&quot;You should try to temper your rage,&quot; the smug voice sounded from behind her. &quot;Too much could further advance your age.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you just call me OLD?!&quot; the enraged beyond belief zebra roared before firing more of the exploding bubbles at the mare.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gilda grit her beak as her armored opponent held his ring weapon in front of him. The interior swirled with darkness and she suddenly felt really weak. Like she was about to fall over. The ground was looking like a better place to take a nap by the moment regardless of the imminent danger her life was in.</p><p class="double">Then her partner blasted Khara Saturn&#039;s weapon off course and she felt a heck of a lot better. Shaking off how frightening that experience had been, she pounced on the rakshasa, determined that he wasn&#039;t getting another shot at her with that thing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ring Tercel darted up towards the armored griffon who commanded the storm. He threw a few rings ahead of him and noted with satisfaction that they successfully diverted the path of a lightning bolt that would have struck him otherwise.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not bad,&quot; Copperbeak Jupiter smirked and flexed his talons, &quot;<i>for a wind-up toy!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">As Ring Tercel engaged his opponent in melee, he hoped that his role as distraction would prove enough for Rainbow Dash to do her part. He only had to last long enough.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie tried to listen to the villainous rant for important information, she really did, but it was just blah, blah, blah, I hate seeing others happy, blah, blah, they all laughed at me, blah, blah, blah, blah, I&#039;m invincible, blah, blah, blah, blah, who&#039;s laughing now, blah, blah, blah, blah, <i>blah</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, bored now,&quot; she declared, mostly to herself, before her wandering eyes latched onto the tubes connecting the oozy pegasus&#039;s helmet and chestplate. &quot;Ooh, this looks important!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? How?&quot; the meanie-mean-ooze-head sputtered in surprise. Honestly, it was like she&#039;d never had someone suddenly and inexplicably appear right next to her. &quot;No, don&#039;t!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie unceremoniously yanked the tube out of their connections.</p><p class="double">&quot;You fool!&quot; the meanie head yelled at her as her form began to droop. &quot;Those were necessary to keep control of my form! Now I can&#039;t keurb blurb blub blub.....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa...&quot; Pinkie stared in horror at the puddle of ooze and empty armor that used to be her opponent before slinking back over to her froggy partner in a daze. &quot;I... I didn&#039;t mean to melt her! I just... she was being mean and scary and talking about destroying all happiness and turning Equestria into Depressedria and can we not tell Twilight that I melted somepony by accident? Please? I didn&#039;t mean it and it was an accid–&quot;</p><p class="double">She was cut off when her froggy partner abruptly shoved her away from him, causing her to skid across the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot; she yelled as she got back to her feet. &quot;What was that... for...?&quot;</p><p class="double">She stared at the mobile acid-green-in-the-process-of-turning-purple ooze now engulfing her amphibious robo-friend. Had she really been so out of it that she missed her Pinkie Sense?</p><p class="double">&quot;Error,&quot; Rain Toad sputtered as he was engulfed by the mass, &quot;Emotional processing unit offli–&quot;</p><p class="double">The ooze seemed to turn and look at her. It wasn&#039;t a nice look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah-heh...&quot; she chuckled nervously and pulled out one of her party munitions from her mane. &quot;Party petard?&quot;</p><p class="double">The ooze blurbled in a way that sounded like laughter and began to form a face. This was why she didn&#039;t like this stuff. Most ghosties could be laughed away, the Smooze just laughed right back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Smmooooozzee........&quot; the blob groaned and started in her direction.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh fun,&quot; Pinkie swore before running as if her ability to enjoy life depended on it.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Bowbowbow-bowbowbow...&quot; </i>(19)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Guts Stallion grunted as he did his best to hold the armored alicorn back. Behind him, Elec Mare crashed into the ground after being hit with a massive blast of energy. Blasts from Cut Mare and Bomb Stallion didn&#039;t even seem to slow him down.</p><p class="double">He and the other Light numbers had been recalled and restored to functionality shortly after the docs had devised a cure, though Ice Mare and Fire Mare had been too far away to reach quickly. They&#039;d remained behind to help keep Canterlot running in the midst of this disaster while Rock and his pals took the Cossack numbers to deal with the source. When they&#039;d gotten word of the attack, they&#039;d mobilized against the bastard advancing on Canterlot and were doing their best to buy time for the guard to prepare a response.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d prefer they take the lump out on their own, but they were getting their flanks kicked left and right.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna swore as she narrowly dodged another blast of dark magic. This foul one-eyed incarnation of the banished tyrant was infuriating! The eye seemed only vulnerable when open and the rest of the body was as harmable as the smoke it appeared made from! And even when it was open, only the mightiest of attacks seemed to deal the beast any harm! At this rate...</p><p class="double">&quot;Noble children of Light!&quot; she called to her battle companions. &quot;Thou must go on ahead and destroy the foul source of the curse that plagues Equestria! We shall deal with this beast Sombra has become!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Small problem, princess!&quot; noble Rock called back as he evaded the beast&#039;s attack.</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s no exit!&quot; the usually gentle Roll finished for her brother.</p><p class="double">Luna charged a spell and blasted away the wall opposite where they entered. &quot;There is now! Make haste and end this plague of darkness while I do battle with this nightmare!&quot;</p><p class="double">As the two reluctantly forged ahead, Luna stared down her opponent.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now it is merely thee and we,&quot; she declared as she readied another spell.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;YYYEEEEESSSSSS.....&quot;</b> the Sombra-devil rumbled in vile glee.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack mused that earthbending tended to be a lot more effective when her opponent didn&#039;t barrel through boulders like they were wet paper. As it was, she was doing her best just to slow the varmint down and dodge the shrapnel.</p><p class="double">Honestly, if it hadn&#039;t been for Drill Dog and his pit traps, she didn&#039;t think she&#039;d have lasted this long. Her opponent being in a blind rage and ignorant of even obvious traps helped too. Still...</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re gonna need a plan here soon I reckon!&quot; she yelled to her partner. &quot;We&#039;re only slowing this fella down and I don&#039;t think we&#039;re gettin&#039; reinforcements any time soon!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I could do something,&quot; Drill Dog yelled back as he wasted a couple more of his bombs on Hammerhoof Uranus&#039;s armor, only serving to make the berserk minotaur angrier, &quot;but you&#039;ll need to keep him busy by yourself while I get it set up!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Done and done!&quot; Applejack yelled back and pulled a lasso out of her subspace pocket. First was to get tall dark and ugly focused solely on her. She whipped the lasso over the thick helmet covering and pulled.</p><p class="double">Hammerhoof stopped for a moment and felt the top of his now unarmored head before turning slowly towards Applejack. His eyes began to turn red as the blood vessels swelled and veins in his forehead bulged ominously. The minotaur&#039;s nostrils flared and Applejack could have sworn that smoke blasted out of them as he snorted in anger.</p><p class="double">&quot;You want it?&quot; she taunted him. &quot;Come an&#039; get it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Hammerhoof Uranus bellowed incoherently and charged after the fleeing farm pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;And don&#039;t let him leave the area!&quot; Drill Dog called to her as he dove underground.</p><p class="double">Applejack didn&#039;t reply. She was too busy running for her life.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;FORGET THE SALE!&quot; Pluto Rex frothed as his claws tore through everything in reach as he dashed around blindly. &quot;WHEN I&#039;M DONE WITH YOU NO ONE WILL EVEN BUY YOU AS MEAT!&quot;</p><p class="double">He hated the unicorn more than anydog he&#039;d ever met! And her little bulb too!</p><p class="double">&quot;AND YOUR TOY WON&#039;T EVEN FETCH A PRICE AS SCRAP METAL!&quot;</p><p class="double">Every time his eyes began to clear, that damnable light would flash and blind him again! And the unicorn had sprayed some atrocious scent all over the area that burned his nose! She&#039;d die just for that!</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, such a foul mouth you have!&quot; the unicorn tittered, causing him to turn towards the sound.</p><p class="double">&quot;BE BROKEN AND DIE!&quot; he screamed as he charged the source of the sound with all the enhanced speed he could muster.</p><p class="double">I#t was too bad he couldn&#039;t see the high tensile strength thread strung across his path.#</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight nursed a chemical burn on her shoulder as Dive Serpent&#039;s missiles intercepted another blast of the corrosive liquid from the not-as-dead-as-he-should-be seapony pirate.</p><p class="double">Why wasn&#039;t she dead yet?</p><p class="double">That fact was bugging her more than even the burn or the fight. These were supposed to be alicorn level opponents. She may still be on the high end for her baseline non-alicorn self despite the power dampening, but she still shouldn&#039;t have been able to mount as effective a defense as she had.</p><p class="double">Her shields actually held under the power of this member of the StarDruids when Luna&#039;s had been cut through like they weren&#039;t there. Her only injuries had come from the splashing of missed shots. Dive Serpent&#039;s missiles were actually keeping up with Blackmane&#039;s water blasts, rendering them much less dangerous, and allowing him to remain mostly undissolved. Plus their opponent seemed more frustrated and less smug than she&#039;d been expecting.</p><p class="double">Her thoughts were interrupted as she raised another shield, which held quite firmly. It was like the water was solely chemical after being manifested, and unable to corrode magical force like it did her companion&#039;s armor.</p><p class="double">Honestly, even accounting for possible overconfidence, she and her partner shouldn&#039;t be doing nearly as well as they were. After all, Ahuizotl had...</p><p class="double">Ahuizotl had played them for chumps.</p><p class="double">Twilight wanted to slap herself when she realized what was going on. Their opponents were powerful, sure, but they weren&#039;t necessarily alicorn tier. At least not in all respects. They were focused. Specialized. Ahuizotl&#039;s laser power allowed him to pierce barriers, even alicorn ones, which made him the perfect choice to catch an unaware defender off guard and kill whatever was left of Equestrian morale. They were supposed to believe the StarDruids were all alicorn-level opponents and that resistance was hopeless.</p><p class="double">But as his original duel with the Lights showed, and they&#039;d failed to pick up on, his other enhancements fell a bit short. He was strong, no question, but he wasn&#039;t as strong as he wanted them to believe.</p><p class="double">After that realization, the rest fell into place. Blackmane&#039;s water weapon didn&#039;t corrode her shields because it wasn&#039;t magic at all. It could only corrode physical substances. And if it wasn&#039;t a magical liquid...</p><p class="double">Well, she&#039;d never beaten an opponent with a &#039;purify water&#039; spell before. But in the Loops, there really was a first time for everything.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Damn,&#039;</i> Blues swore internally as he gave the room he and Daring had ended up in a cursory scan. <i>&#039;Dead end.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">He was about to backtrack and find a different way when he noticed Daring staring at some of the ancient writing that circled the chamber.</p><p class="double">&quot;Blues,&quot; the pegasus explorer&#039;s breath hitched, &quot;do you know what this <i>says</i>?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ancient languages aren&#039;t exactly my specialty,&quot; he reminded her.</p><p class="double">&quot;It says here that Le Tor wasn&#039;t the enemy of the Magi,&quot; Daring turned to him with wide eyes. &quot;He–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Was its leader,&quot; finished the voice of Ahuizotl from the room&#039;s entrance right before it slammed shut.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, get those canisters ready!&quot; Shining Armor commanded what little of the guard force was currently battle ready. &quot;Let&#039;s see how this &#039;Le Tor&#039; likes knockout gas!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Belay that!&quot; the frantic voice of Dr. Light intruded into the preparations while the older stallion waved around some device that he seemed to think was important.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why should we?&quot; Shining glared at the doctor. Brilliant or not, the stallion was not in command and his nerves were frayed enough as it was without having his judgement called into question without sound reason.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because your foe is not an alicorn!&quot; Dr. Light panted. &quot;He&#039;s not even alive!&quot;</p><p class="double">That sounded like a sound reason. &quot;Explain.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;These readings here,&quot; Dr. Light thrust the device into Shining&#039;s face, &quot;show that under the armor is nothing but metal, wires, and electronics! The armor may be the genuine article, but what lies inside it is not!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Sweet mother of Celestia damn it!&#039;</i> Shining cursed mentally and rubbed his face with his hoof. There went his entire battle plan. &quot;What now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;These readings here,&quot; Dr. Light pointed to something that to Shining could have been written in Bushwoolie for all he understood it, &quot;show that the thaumic core is powered by the same Nightmare Force that shrouds Equestria! If we can just douse it with the cure, we may be able to render it inert!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How much do we have right now?&quot; Shining asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Enough for one good attempt since I doubt he&#039;ll go willingly,&quot; Dr. Light admitted. &quot;With Rain Toad on the mission, Dr. Cossack and Nyx won&#039;t have another batch ready for hours.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;ll have to do,&quot; Shining admitted. &quot;Okay everyone! Listen up! Change of plans!&quot;</p><p class="double">None of them noticed a filly eavesdropper sneak away.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><i>&#039;ANALYZING SUBSTANCE...&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora resisted the urge to smirk as her opponent&#039;s jaw dropped when she was revealed unharmed behind a shimmering skull-shaped barrier.</p><p class="double">&quot;Closing your mouth would be wise,&quot; she stated, &quot;unless you care to capture flies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Impossible...&quot; the traitorous mercenary growled. &quot;You should be a smear! No barrier is strong enough to defend against my power!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course it is,&quot; a new voice interjected as a third zebra, the robotic Skull Mane, entered the clearing. &quot;Provided you know how to modulate it properly. And since you&#039;re so free with demonstrating your power on phantoms, it gave me ample time to study and adapt.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll give you a demonstration!&quot; Zuri yelled and flung more of the exploding bubbles at them both. Like the ones before, they detonating harmlessly on Skull Mane&#039;s shields as Zecora walked calmly forward.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good night,&quot; she said when she was practically nose to nose with the mercenary, right before blowing a powder in her face. &quot;Sleep tight.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mercenary was unconscious before she hit the ground.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Fluttershy was no stranger to being shot at, nor was she a stranger to life or death battles. She&#039;d raised Lehman Russ after all. Still, trying to fight anything that outmassed and outgunned you tended to involve a lot of running. And with the power she&#039;d amassed over the Loops taking a hit, she was <i>very</i> outgunned at the moment.</p><p class="double">Still, she&#039;d managed to make a good showing right up until she tripped over an exposed root. And with a murderous dragon bearing down and her druidic magic still on the fritz, things weren&#039;t exactly looking up.</p><p class="double">&quot;You leave Miss Fluttershy alone you great brute!&quot; the voice of her robot partner yelled as he jumped in front of her and began sucking in air and debris for all he was worth. The mechanical lapine obviously meant well, but the strength of his vacuum was, well, laughable next to the immense war machine that was the armed and armored dragon Inti Mars.</p><p class="double">&quot;You cannot be serious...&quot; said dragon blinked as he tried to process the action. &quot;You are a glorified vacuum cleaner! I am a <i>god of war</i>!&quot;</p><p class="double">The main cannon on his head took aim at the two as Dust Bunny stared defiantly back. The robot&#039;s suction died down and Fluttershy saw something working its way back up her companion&#039;s only weapon.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are <i>nothing</i> before my might!&quot; Inti bellowed as he prepared to fire.</p><p class="double">Dust Bunny was faster. The compressed ball of debris fired back out his head-mounted vacuum and right down the barrel mounted on Inti Mars&#039;s head. The munitions about to fire at them both detonated in the barrel and the dragon roared in pain.</p><p class="double">But he did not fall.</p><p class="double">&quot;FOR THAT YOU DIE FIRST!&quot; the dragon roared and prepared to crush the robot.</p><p class="double">Even after countless Loops, Fluttershy still had issues defending herself from those who were hostile towards her. She could, of course, but it wasn&#039;t her first instinct. Protecting others though? That was second nature to her.</p><p class="double">Suddenly her opponent was looking much more her size as she roared her own challenge back and slammed her yellow-scaled claws into his torso. Flicking her flowing pink hair out of her face, the now draconic Fluttershy focused on rending the one who would hurt her friend in two. (20)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight spat water out of her mouth as she finished helping Dive Serpent haul their defeated opponent out of the river. As predicted, with his corrosive weapon turned to pure water, he was essentially harmless. Tough, sure, but offensively not much of an issue.</p><p class="double">At least not with a larger combatant on her side who had ranged weapons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh,&quot; she blinked as she realized the &#039;body&#039; in the armor was now nothing more than a clay statue. &quot;I&#039;d heard about these things, but I&#039;d never seen them.

Oh, Bright Mane...!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Y-yes ma&#039;am?&quot; the timid robot replied from where he was standing a fair distance away. Honestly, she didn&#039;t see what he had to be afraid of.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do be a dear and carry this for me, would you?&quot; Rarity fluttered her eyelashes. &quot;We simply <i>must</i> be on our way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; the robot hesitated in confusion, not understanding the tone. &quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah-ah-ah!&quot; Ahuizotl Terra tsked as Blues pointed his hoof cannon at him and pointed his hand-tail laser weapon right back. &quot;I wouldn&#039;t do that if I were you...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve seen your weapon in action,&quot; Blues returned confidently. &quot;I can handle it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Daring&#039;s old foe allowed before turning to point the weapon at the archaeologist, &quot;but can she?&quot;</p><p class="double">Blues continued glaring, but lowered his weapon.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s your game Ahuizotl?&quot; Daring asked defiantly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just taking what&#039;s rightfully mine,&quot; the creature explained. &quot;What&#039;s always been rightfully mine according to these writings.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Explain,&quot; Daring demanded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Everything you Equestrians have ever heard about the Magi is wrong,&quot; their opponent declared smugly. &quot;They were not the enemies of Le Tor, they were his most loyal followers. Members of every race dedicated to seeking out knowledge and power and using it to rule the world. This armor I wear? It&#039;s no coincidence it fits me so well. It belonged to my ancestor, Le Tor&#039;s second in command with the title of &#039;Terra&#039;. They were the best of friends and the most loyal of allies, developing the artifact of Le Mu together to control the sun and stars. At least until the unicorn members decided they were done sharing mystical knowledge with the other races and turned on the rest of the order.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You can&#039;t possibly be claiming–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, but I <i>can</i>,&quot; Ahuizotl Terra grinned fiercely. &quot;All the names you know us by are merely labels used to keep the truth to ourselves, and no longer necessary. We are the new Magi, and the rightful rulers of all the world.&quot;</p><p class="double">And without warning, he lunged at them both.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;ANALYSIS COMPLETE...&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;OPTIMAL SOLVENT DETERMINED...&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;SYNTHESIZING SOLVENT...&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow was currently having to reevaluate her plan. Going above the storm to try and dissipate it with a Sonic Rainboom had taken her too close to the main shroud of darkness and the proximity had made her light-headed.</p><p class="double">Right now, she was lining herself up for Plan B. Because she&#039;d only get one shot at it.</p><p class="double">It was a lot like Plan A, just with a different target.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rock and Roll surprisingly managed to make it to the artifact chamber without incident. It took them a few moments to fully realize that, yes, there really were no more defenses or obstacles between them and the current version of Ra Moon.</p><p class="double">The only thing that bothered them as they stepped inside was that they had yet to hear from Dr. Wily.</p><p class="double">But as they entered, there seemed to be no sign of him, or of any surprises. Even the artifact, the familiar giant obsidian orb ringed with intricate designs and emblazoned with a red eye design, looked completely undefended. The two mechanical heroes traded looks and shrugged before taking aim at the artifact of Le Mu.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wouldn&#039;t do that if I were you,&quot; the voice of their recurring foe interrupted. Strangely, it came as a bit of a relief. Known Dr. Wily quantities were almost always preferable to unknown ones.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why not?&quot; Roll asked politely.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because if you don&#039;t...&quot; Wily&#039;s voice declared as a large monitor on the other side of the room lit up showing a familiar scene.</p><p class="double">It was a video feed of Canterlot. From the eyes of an attacker.</p><p class="double">&quot;...well, I&#039;m afraid Ra Th–*ahem* Le Tor will stop playing nice.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">All she knew was rage. This insolent hatchling had dared to harm her precious treasure and now he would pay. With blood and pain and–</p><p class="double">&quot;–iss Fluttershy stop!&quot; a voice snapped her out of the red haze. &quot;Our foe is defeated! You don&#039;t have to do any more!&quot;</p><p class="double">She paused and looked at the other dragon beneath her. He failed to move or retaliate. Was he dead? Did it matter? Why did her head hurt so much?</p><p class="double">&quot;You must change back Miss Fluttershy!&quot;</p><p class="double">Right, she was supposed to be a pony, not a dragon. As if the thought was the trigger, she began to shrink back to her normal form.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh!&quot; she gasped as her head cleared. &quot;Yes, that&#039;s much better. What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure,&quot; Dust Bunny replied. &quot;I&#039;d imagine that your transformation into a dragon changed how the curse affected you even with the treatment in place, but without further information I can&#039;t be sure.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is he...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;ll live.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, good. I couldn&#039;t bear it if... We should find the others now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course Miss Fluttershy.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The guards waited until the right moment as the mechanical alicorn strode calmly towards the palace. When it was in the spot, they all sprung out and flung the anti-dark magic potion at the robot.</p><p class="double">Only to watch it slide off a magic barrier, never reaching the target.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Any time now,&#039;</i> Applejack thought furiously as the super-strong minotaur drew ever closer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Done!&quot; Drill Dog popped up nearby.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ain&#039;t nothin&#039; happenin&#039;!&quot; Applejack yelled back.</p><p class="double">&quot;It just needs a trigger!&quot; the robot caninoid replied. &quot;The ground is as porous as a sponge now!

She pushed her earthbending into the ground hastily and jumped for all she was worth.</p><p class="double">The ground caved under her like it was hit with a meteor and Hammerhoof Uranus bellowed in confusion as he was buried in rock and dirt.</p><p class="double">&quot;He gonna live?&quot; Applejack asked worriedly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was more concerned with <i>you</i> living to be honest.&quot; her companion answered.</p><p class="double">Applejack thought that over for a moment. &quot;Fair &#039;nuff.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jupiter, formerly known as Copperbeak, scowled as his foe&#039;s eyes widened and he disengaged hastily.

He&#039;ll live, thanks to his armor, but it is uncertain if he&#039;ll ever walk again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was expecting him to dodge and be knocked out by the shockwave!&quot; Rainbow insisted. &quot;Not take a direct hit!&quot;</p><p class="double">She was prevented from reassuring Dash that it was alright, she&#039;d probably have to arrange counseling after they got back to Ponyville, when the rest began showing up. First Rarity and Bright Mane with Pluto Rex&#039;s regalia in tow, then Zecora and Skull Mane with both a restrained Zuri and her own armor, Applejack and Drill Dog with Hammerhoof Uranus&#039;s helmet, and finally Dust Bunny and Fluttershy. The latter who had apparently beaten Inti Mars to a bloody pulp. All that was left was to find Pinkie and Rain Toad and then go meet up with Gilda and Pharaoh Sphinx and see if the strike teams needed reinforcing.</p><p class="double">Before she could even suggest searching for her, Pinkie burst into the clearing like the terror of a thousand Loops was after her.</p><p class="double">Then the Smooze broke through the treeline and Twilight admitted that wasn&#039;t far off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;ARMED...&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;RAIN FLUSH: FIRE&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Before anyone could react, a rocket broke through the Smooze&#039;s body and rocketed into the clouds above and burst. For a few long seconds nothing else happened. Even the Smooze&#039;s attention was on the sky, apparently puzzling out what had just happened.</p><p class="double">Then the first drops of rain fell, increasing to a downpour in moments. The Smooze writhed as if in pain as the rain pummeled it mercelissly and it began to dissolve and thin. More and more the Smooze melted into harmless liquid the soil drank greedily until the group could make out a form contained within. As the Smooze melted off of it, Rain Toad stood and stretched.</p><p class="double">&quot;Emotional Processing error corrected,&quot; the robot monotoned. &quot;Reinitializing... Damnit Pinkie, pay attention next time!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie stared at the restored robot and sniffled. And then began to tear up.

He&#039;d barely managed to deflect one shot of the faux Spark Chaser weapon with his shield (the thing really was just about indestructible) and he needed to disable it before Daring&#039;s old foe got bored and decided to stop toying with them.</p><p class="double">It might help if Daring would stop staring at whatever new glyph she found so interesting on the damn wall after being thrown into it.</p><p class="double">The armor he had was very energy resistant, so he switched to the Dust Crusher and fired at the laser gauntlet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gah!&quot; Ahuizotl cried out as the offensive piece of his armor sparked wildly. &quot;You&#039;ll pay for that you little...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahuizotl, stop!&quot; Daring warned suddenly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rock and Roll watched impotently as the view of Le Tor&#039;s video feed approached the Canterlot gates and a bedraggled looking Celestia limped out to meet it.</p><p class="double">&quot;What.... do..... you...... want.....?&quot; Celestia gasped out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, nothing much, princess,&quot; Dr. Wily&#039;s voice sounded from both ends of the feed. &quot;Just your immediate and unconditional surrender.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Never!&quot; a young voice yelled defiantly as the dark form of the robot alicorn filly Nyx interposed itself between Dr. Wily&#039;s creation and the ruler of Equestria.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Took you all long enough,&quot; Gilda greeted the group as they approached the ruins, sitting atop a bound, gagged, and de-armored Khara.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gilda?&quot; Rainbow blurted out at the sight of her friend.

For one, you couldn&#039;t &#039;retrieve&#039; somepony else&#039;s magic that way, just your own. For another, it was a pretty darn sloppy way to undo spells and sometimes had unforeseen consequences. And finally, if you took too much back at once, you could give yourself a really bad headache.</p><p class="double">The first one could be circumvented in this specific scenario only because Nyx was a robot that ran on the same wavelength of dark magic as the attacker. The second was a non issue right now because, whatever happened, it could only improve the current situation. The third was the tricky one. Nyx couldn&#039;t take in the whole curse because she just couldn&#039;t store that much. But the power driving a single robot?</p><p class="double">That she could do.</p><p class="double">Concentrating, Nyx connected easily with the dark magic powering the robo-alicorn before her and <i>pulled</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;What are you doing you insolent whelp?!&quot; Wily&#039;s voice protested from the robot. &quot;I demand you stop this at o–&quot;</p><p class="double">The robot&#039;s eyes dimmed as the last of its power was removed and it collapsed like a puppet with its string cut.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was &#039;professional courtesy&#039;. Perhaps it was the fact that he&#039;d never heard quite that tone of seriousness in her voice. Whatever it was, Ahuizotl <i>did</i> stop.</p><p class="double">&quot;And why should I do that Miss Do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because of what this passage says!&quot; Daring pointed insistently at the section of the wall next to her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that?&quot; Ahuizotl rolled his eyes. &quot;That just tells how the artifact of Le Mu was used to imprison the sun and stars. Much like it&#039;s doing now. A little vandalized perhaps, but what old ruin isn&#039;t?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you ever going to learn to read these things properly?&quot; Daring snarled at her foe and pointed to a particularly complex glyph with a crude line carved through it. &quot;This doesn&#039;t mean the <i>actual</i> sun and stars! Written like this, an accurate translation is &#039;one who is as important as the sun and stars&#039;, or the ancient symbol for a <i>ruler</i>. The line through it isn&#039;t vandalism, though scholars say the practice may have begun that way. It means that the individual being referenced was <i>despised</i>. A tyrant in this case.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are...&quot; Blues blinked, Ahuizotl Terra mirroring the action, &quot;are you saying that the artifact is an actual prison?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes!&quot; Daring confirmed. &quot;A &#039;prison of darkness to hold light most foul&#039;. And if I&#039;m reading this right... Whoever it is is still in there. And alive.&quot;</p><p class="double">Blues took a moment to process that before reaching the same conclusion Daring had.</p><p class="double">&quot;We have to stop my brother and sister from destroying it!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When the video feed went down and Wily began cursing and railing about it, Rock and Roll charged their Mega Busters and took aim at the artifact of Le Mu.</p><p class="double">&quot;NO!&quot; Dr. Wily yelled when he noticed them. &quot;STOP! DO–&quot;</p><p class="double">The two charged shots tore through the artifact, causing it to explode and dust to fill the room. In the center of the dust cloud, where the artifact used to be, and orange glow pulsed to life.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no...&quot; Wily moaned in dismay. &quot;What have you two done...?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pulse grew stronger and seemed to stand. As the dust cleared, the Light twins and Dr. Wily could see a figure begin to take shape.</p><p class="double">The hooves came into view first. Clad in royal blue armor and more massive than any known pony&#039;s. As more was revealed, it became clear that the equine body was larger than even Celestia&#039;s, with a masculine bulk that would have put Big Mac to shame, and covered in the same armor. And then the head started to come into view, only it wasn&#039;t a head. It was a second torso. Covered in the same armor as the rest of the body, this second torso was revealed to have ape-like arms and hands attached.</p><p class="double">The figure was a centaur.</p><p class="double">Then the real head was revealed. The helmet covered the entire face save the eyes, which blazed with light, and atop the head were a pair of massive wicked-looking horns. Like a demon. The icon of the sun was attached firmly to the forehead.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Aaahhh,&quot;</b> the figure stretched in its newfound freedom. <b>&quot;After ten thousand years, I am free.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">Rock and Roll did their best to keep calm at this new development, but it was hard.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;It is time for the world to recognize the unforgiving light of it&#039;s true master.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">In the back, Dr. Wily tried his best to sneak silently away.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;It is time for all to bow before Tirek Sunstar.&quot;</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Right as they agreed on a plan of action to back up the strike teams, Twilight and the others felt the spark as their Elements began to regain power and the dark curse began to recede.

Mega Mare!&quot; Blues yelled for his siblings as he, Daring, and Ahuizotl tore down the hall towards the innermost chamber where the artifact of Le Mu rested. While their ultimate goals were different, even Ahuizotl had agreed to a truce to stop whoever was imprisoned in the artifact from being released. &quot;Don&#039;t–&quot;</p><p class="double">All three skidded to a halt at the sight in the chamber. The artifact lay shattered and standing in the rubble was a massive armored centaur. The royal blues of the armor contrasted with the bright sun-like flames that licked out of every seam and the heat that rolled off of him was more unbearable than the hottest summer.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Ah, more supplicants to bow before the world&#039;s rightful ruler and his most holy of light,&quot;</b> the centaur mused at them.</p><p class="double">&quot;How do you know our language?&quot; Daring stared wide-eyed. &quot;The words of our eras should be incomprehensible to the other!&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Your ignorance will be permitted this once,&quot;</b> the centaur stared back. <b>&quot;For how could you in your imperfections know of the gift of tongues that I in my holy righteousness possess?

The centaur was hit directly, not even bothering to move or even block it seemed. But then, he&#039;d only let out a grunt when struck and hadn&#039;t even been pushed back all that much. Luna, however, had followed up the blast by charging the figure right behind it. Twilight could feel the way Luna was using her earth pony magic to enhance her strength for the physical blow all the way from where she stood without even trying.</p><p class="double">Luna struck true and the centaur&#039;s armored head snapped back from the blow and there was a scream of pain.</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s scream.</p><p class="double">The alicorn of the moon plummeted beck in their direction, holding the hoof that she&#039;d used to strike her opponent to her and hit the ground hard. She skidded to a halt a short distance away and Twilight got a good look at the hoof. Or rather, the charred stump where it used to be. She could even see the fine charcoal powder marring Luna&#039;s coat and realized what had happened.</p><p class="double"><i>You&#039;re telling me that this fortress somehow managed to charcoalize an alicorn&#039;s hoof?</i></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Great exfoliation,&#039;</i> Twilight thought in horror, <i>&#039;he&#039;s a living sun!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Twi?&quot; Applejack looked at her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;Elements, girls,&quot; Twilight replied, summoning hers.

Tirek Sunstar didn&#039;t even seem to notice. At least at first.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Pathetic,&quot;</b> he scowled and formed an orb of solar flame in one hand larger than either of them. <b>&quot;And to think you claimed to be children of light.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">The blast didn&#039;t hit them. However, the shockwave from when it hit the temple and exploded threw them off their feet and sent them tumbling down the outer walls. After several seconds of seeming to hit every ledge and decorative carving, they landed near the group of their friends and allies.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;You are not worthy of such a claim,&quot;</b> the voice of Tirek Sunstar called after them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there,&quot; Rock smiled at the others weakly. &quot;You having as much fun as we are?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably,&quot; Pinkie chirped. &quot;Because I&#039;m not having any fun right now and that didn&#039;t look fun at all.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;You are weak and insolent,&quot;</b> the armored centaur continued, seemingly so confident in his power that he saw no need to follow up his attack.</p><p class="double">&quot;We brought you a few things,&quot; Rarity told them as she set the bundle of Pluto Rex&#039;s armor before them. It was followed by pieces of armor from Desert Mercury, Khara Saturn, Zuri Venus, Hammerhoof Uranus, Copperbeak Jupiter, and Blackmane Neptune.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Fluttershy apologized from where she was trying fruitlessly to see to Luna&#039;s injury. &quot;Inti Mars&#039;s was a little big to carry.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Defiant of your betters,&quot;</b> Tirek continued, uncaring for the tableau below him.</p><p class="double">&quot;No worries,&quot; Roll told her as she and her brother proceeded to scan the enchantments on each armor for their variable weapons systems as quickly as possible. &quot;I tagged him as I ran past. Rock got Hammerhoof&#039;s as well.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Just like my ungrateful son, Le Tor.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, <i>what</i>?&quot; Daring and Twilight whipped their heads around to stare at Tirek.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Blast!&quot; Dr. Wily swore as he tried to fix Ahuizotl&#039;s weapon. &quot;What did you <i>do</i> Break Mane?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I defended myself,&quot; Blues retorted curtly. &quot;Now hurry up. Tirek Sunstar deciding to monologue his history is giving us some time, but that&#039;s not going to last.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;So, you have heard of the ungrateful spawn,&quot;</b> Tirek Sunstar rumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah, but his parentage is lost to history!&quot; Twilight replied, her nature for seeking knowledge driving her mouth. &quot;All we know about him is that he imprisoned the sun! Which, come to think of it is probably you, so...&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;I see...&quot;</b> Tirek&#039;s sneer was audible. <b>&quot;This is the thanks I get for my life of Holy service?

The taint has spread its roots deeper than I imagined.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;But...&quot; Daring&#039;s eyes were wide. &quot;Queen Majesty is a myth!&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Oh, the mad queen was quite real,&quot;</b> Tirek told them. <b>&quot;As was her vile and unholy power to wish for anything, including the enslavement of the hearts and minds of all under her domain, save those she thought &#039;unworthy&#039; of her &#039;protection&#039;, instead wishing for them to be the monsters she saw them as. How all the races cheered when I slew her at last, their minds finally their own. And how naive I was to allow her misbegotten spawn to live afterwards. How foolish I was to raise him as my own.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">Twilight began to feel ill. She&#039;d had one run-in with a version of Queen Majesty and this one sounded even worse than that one. How bad did someone need to be until Tirek of all beings was seen as a hero by comparison?</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Le Tor had not the madness of his dam, may the heavens be praised for such small favors,&quot;</b> Tirek continued, <b>&quot;but he had ideas unworthy of his position. All under the sun have their place, and to step outside it is unthinkable and a perversion of all that is Just. But he insisted on the misguided notion that all, even the lowest of the low, deserved enlightenment. As if higher callings were meant for any but those chosen to rule. To grant such to those unworthy to possess it is the greatest folly of all, and I forbade him to do so. But the one I called my son, even after I shed my weak form of flesh to better enable my holy crusade, could not find it in himself to be obedient. And so, behind my back and against the will of the heavens, he formed the treasonous Magi.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">As he spoke, Ahuizotl clad in his repaired Terra armor exited the temple, followed by Blues and both turned to face the blazing figure above.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;He welcomed all into his fold,&quot;</b> Tirek turned to Daring&#039;s recurring foe. <b>&quot;Including the most unworthy of misshapen demons like your ancestor. Truly, I regret that my efforts to erase your despicable kind were not more successful.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">Ahuizotl&#039;s face showed shock, and then rage. For the first time Daring Do could remember, her nemesis forewent gloating or taunting and simply attacked, the laser weapon of his Magi armor lancing through the armored centaur again and again.</p><p class="double">Tirek Sunstar remained unmoved.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Very well,&quot;</b> he spoke, even as Ahuizotl fired again. <b>&quot;If battle is the end you crave, then you shall have it!&quot;</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The group of robots, ponies, zebra, and griffon hadn&#039;t been idle. While some listened to Tirek Sunstar&#039;s monologue, others had been arranging a plan of battle. Bright Mane had begun with the revelation that even though he appeared unharmed, Tirek was taking damage from the attacks.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s hard to see because of the light he puts off,&quot; the light-generating robot had said, &quot;but each impact is leaving a mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yon Bright Mane speaks true,&quot; Luna had gasped as she got to her remaining hooves, her horn glowing with some spell. &quot;The villain&#039;s armor hast an ancient and seemingly incomplete form of protective enchantment on it. Almost all force from any assault is sent to his immortal body of flame, leaving the armor to take what little is left. All strikes, no matter how mighty, deal his armor the same manner of harm. But the armor also seems to sustain his form. If it is lost, then his body wouldst be lost in kind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then we use the &#039;Death of a Thousand Cuts&#039;,&quot; Daring nodded firmly as Dash finished strapping Copperbeak Jupiter&#039;s gauntlets to her forehooves as best she could and Applejack strapped Hammerhoof Uranus&#039;s helmet to her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh,&quot; Gilda smirked, gripping the ring she&#039;d kept from Khara Saturn. &quot;So we&#039;re using the griffon way to end this. Traditional, no less.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The ancient griffons would pardon any crime if only the perpetrator could survive one thousand cuts from the wronged parties,&quot; Ring Tercel explained quickly as the rest of the Cossack numbers finished preparations.</p><p class="double">&quot;Darling,&quot; Rarity rolled her eyes as she finished hastily adjusting Pluto Rex&#039;s regalia to her form. It wasn&#039;t her best work, but it would just have to do. &quot;I <i>don&#039;t</i> think we&#039;re going to be keeping count.&quot; (23)</p><p class="double">&quot;I certainly hope not,&quot; Drill Dog snarled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Everyone know the plan?&quot; Rock checked quickly, getting a chorus of nods. &quot;Then break!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dr. Wily grumbled as he furiously finished adjustments to his contingency plan and began the siphoning of remaining Nightmare Force into its power core.</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh...&quot; he chuckled. &quot;The ancient Magi were geniuses for their time, but only <i>I</i> could have perfected their arts into this ultimate creation! When the activation sequence is complete, even this &#039;Tirek Sunstar&#039; will not stand before its power!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy regretted that there didn&#039;t seem to be any way to deal with Tirek Sunstar without involving death, but she knew that often times that was the way of life. Sometimes things must perish so that others can live. It was the way of nature, and over the Loops she&#039;d become ever more in touch with the cycles of nature and life through her druidic practices and made it her way as well.</p><p class="double">Right now, she was doing her best to support the others in their efforts. Some nature charms to boost the protective efforts of the others as they unleashed everything they could upon the genocidal centaur above them.</p><p class="double">Twilight and Luna had both warded everyone as best they could, but even so they were all trying their best not to get hit. On the offense, the purple unicorn and the princess of the night were foregoing their normal magical prowess to simply unleash raw magical bolts upon their common foe; Rarity dashed around with incredible speed from the &#039;borrowed&#039; regalia she wore, sniping her solar foe from every angle; Applejack used her earth-bending and the strength boost from her pilfered helmet to heave rocks and stones upwards; Pinkie was using her pink lantern ring, though its power seemed weakened from its wielder&#039;s loss of good mood; Rainbow Dash was using the gauntlets she&#039;d acquired to summon intermittent bolts of lightning; Gilda stood off to the side, aiming the draining effect of the ring she&#039;s won from her opponent at Tirek, even if it seemed to do little; Zecora was mixing her potions with the exploding bubbles her own acquired armor produced to decent effect; Cossack&#039;s robots leveled support fire from every angle they could along with the Lights; Daring Do had accepted the gauntlets of Blackmane Neptune from Twilight, allowing her to occasionally manifest a ball of water that she shot at the centaur above; and Ahuizotl kept shooting Tirek in rage.</p><p class="double">This had been going on for minutes and, in retrospect, it couldn&#039;t have lasted.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Your valor is commendable, even if your allegiance is not,&quot;</b> Tirek Sunstar spoke up suddenly. <b>&quot;But I tire of this distraction.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">There was little warning. None of the gestures he&#039;d been using to telegraph his blast up until now. He simply pointed his hand at Ahuizotl and unleashed a gigantic beam of light.</p><p class="double">Ahuizotl was already trying to dodge, and he half managed it. But that still left the other half blasted by a beam of heat that turned the ground below into molten stone. It was only the combined protections of his armor and the wardings of Twilight and Luna, backed by Fluttershy&#039;s druidic magic, that saved his life. But even then the stench of burning flesh reached them all as Ahuizotl frantically ripped off his orange-hot armor amidst pained howls.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;This guy could land in a Dragonball Loop and no one there would think him out of place,&#039;</i> Twilight thought numbly. That blast had burned through her wards, Luna&#039;s, and the forgotten magic of an ancient order enhanced by mad magical science and <i>still</i> nearly killed Ahuizotl.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;I know Rock says he&#039;s never lost to this Sunstar guy Tirek&#039;s fused with in his home Loop, but if he tries to unleash another one of those, I&#039;m going alicorn, consequences be damn–&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;ARRGGHHH!!&quot;</b> Tirek&#039;s pained cry cut off her thoughts as a massive blast of dark magic ripped into him.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Or I could let the obvious deus ex machina do it for me,&#039;</i> she admitted as the newest combatant climbed out of the hole in the temple. It was a massive black devil-series robot with glowing runes on its body, and the eye had apparently been designed as a one-pony cockpit containing none other than Dr. Wily.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!&quot;</b> The mad scientist&#039;s voice boomed out from the machine as an armored covering slid over the cockpit. <b>&quot;Yes! Fall before the power of my ultimate Wily Machine: Le Devil!&quot;</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rain Toad had been mostly using his ability to produce water to put out the numerous fires Tirek Sunstar had been making. Thus he was the first on the scene to douse the burned Ahuizotl and his red-hot armor before further damage was done.</p><p class="double">The second on the scene was Daring Do, feeling something she would fervently deny was concern.</p><p class="double">&quot;Take it...&quot; Ahuizotl hissed through the pain as he handed the one piece of his regalia that wasn&#039;t warped by the heat of Tirek Sunstar&#039;s blast, the laser shooting gauntlet on his tail, to his long-time foe. &quot;Make him pay...&quot;</p><p class="double">Daring was all too happy to ditch the current gauntlets she had as the water weapon they shot wasn&#039;t doing much more than creating steam when it hit the solar villain. She was also willing to honor her nemesis&#039;s request, since none should ever be the victim of the kind of systematic genocide Tirek Sunstar claimed he&#039;d attempted against Ahuizotl&#039;s species. Unfortunately, she didn&#039;t see how it was going to improve things any.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good,&quot; the voice of Proto Mane startled her. &quot;His weapon is intact. We&#039;ll need that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why?!&quot; Daring sniped at the robot. &quot;It&#039;s not doing any more damage to Tirek Sunstar than anything <i>else</i> we throw at him! Only that... thing... of Dr. Wily&#039;s even hurt him!&quot;</p><p class="double">Even now, they could see Tirek Sunstar on the ground, flames burning the undergrowth and the dirt and stone melting and warping from the heat he put off. Wily&#039;s Le Devil creation was indeed occupying Tirek Sunstar&#039;s full attention, but the way the centaur kept incinerating large pieces of its form, that wasn&#039;t going to last.</p><p class="double">&quot;He targeted Ahuizotl for a reason,&quot; Blues replied. &quot;The laser he shoots isn&#039;t hurting him more with each hit that anything else, but the way it changes direction in midair means it hits several times with each shot. It&#039;s the best weapon we&#039;ve got after Wily&#039;s latest project. I&#039;ve already transferred my data on it to Mega Mane and Mega Mare and they&#039;re getting in position. As soon as we get an opening, we&#039;re going to let him have it with all four barrels.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Daring nodded. &quot;Let&#039;s do this.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Foul servant of darkness!&quot;</b> Tirek Sunstar cursed Le Devil as he endured another blast of dark magic. <b>&quot;My holy light shall never be extinguished!&quot;</b></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Insolent relic of a bygone era!&quot;</b> Wily shouted back as Le Devil crashed to the ground after its leg was blasted off.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;You shall be the first to be cleansed!&quot;</b> the enraged centaur gathered power and unleashed a massive blast at the downed monstrosity.</p><p class="double">The machine exploded with enough force to dissipate the energy wave and when the dust settled, Dr. Wily sat amidst some broken bits of machinery. A bit scraped and bruised, but alive. It was clear to those who knew how such things worked that he&#039;d designed shaped charges into the cockpit to negate any force that breached its protections while not harming the pilot.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;And thus your taint is purged,&quot;</b> the voice of his blazing opponent intoned with all the finality of an executioner.</p><p class="double">But just before he unleashed the fatal blast at the doctor, Mega Mane tackled Wily out of the way.</p><p class="double">&quot;Argh!&quot; Rock screamed as the end of one of his hind legs was clipped by the blast and melted clean off.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;A futile ges–&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;NOW!&quot; Roll yelled and three lasers like Ahuizotl&#039;s weapon, the Spark Chaser, lanced through Tirek Sunstar repeatedly. For several long moments it appeared as if the powerful foe had been impaled by an entire cage of pure crackling light.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;ENOUGH!&quot;</b> the enraged bellow was accompanied by an explosion of flame that rushed over the entire battlefield.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash tried her best to get her heart back under control after the wave of solar flame dissipated. She hadn&#039;t had time to analyze the pull on her Element when the centaur guy had lost it and had just thrown everything she could into the connection.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d forgotten that Twilight had told her and the others about her research into other ways to use the Elements. Most importantly at the moment, using them defensively. But as she looked down and saw everypony, and every non-pony, alive and well (24) she thanked whatever had possessed her egghead friend to do the research in the first place.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;So, you live,&quot;</b> Tirek Sunstar, the great and holy light of all the world, observed as the so-called &#039;son of light&#039; got to his remaining hooves. <b>&quot;It shall–&quot;</b></p><p class="double">He paused as he observed the way the stallion&#039;s leg terminated. It was not charred and blackened like flesh would be, but melted the entire way across. Even if the pretender did wear armor, it would not have done that.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;So... you are naught but a golem of metal pretending to be a pony,&quot;</b> he mused. <b>&quot;One who can not help but run to the rescue of his dark master.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, Dr. Wily&#039;s my worst enemy,&quot; the golem replied calmly.</p><p class="double">.....What?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twilight?&quot; the voice of Roll interrupted the local Anchor&#039;s thoughts again.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Honestly, I&#039;m starting to think this Loop </i>likes <i>shooting down my decisions to solve the problems it sends my way with my incredible alicorn powers,&#039;</i> Twilight mentally grumbled as she turned to hear whatever plan the robot mare was bringing to her. And with that tone, it really couldn&#039;t be anything else. &quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How much protective magic can you send my brother&#039;s way?&quot; the Mega Mare asked. &quot;Discretely if at all possible.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quite a bit,&quot; Twilight replied, becoming more intrigued by the second. &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because Mega Mane&#039;s done analyzing how our opponent fights,&quot; she replied succinctly. &quot;My brother&#039;s intending to end this as decisively as he can. One-on-one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, he&#039;s going to challenge a <i>living sun</i> to a <i>duel</i>?&quot; Twilight blurted incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not like it would be the first time,&quot; the mechanical mare shrugged in a resigned fashion.</p><p class="double">The looping unicorn blinked a few times as she processed that. &quot;We&#039;d better hedge our bets and get Luna on board.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Already done,&quot; Roll replied. &quot;Blues says she sounds rather enthusiastic about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;What manner of being would save a mortal enemy from death?&quot;</b> Tirek sounded confused. Good. The less sure he was of things, the less dangerous he became.</p><p class="double">&quot;One who is living proof that your son was right,&quot; the Mega Mane replied calmly as he noted Dr. Wily inching away as unobtrusively as equinely possible. Even better. The further Wily was from this, the less likely he&#039;d get hurt.</p><p class="double">The strange and unique variant on his recurring foe Sunstar seemed to narrow his perception menacingly. <b>&quot;Do explain.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Your son believed that all, no matter what station in life they were born to, deserved to be educated,&quot; Rock explained calmly as he began preparations for what he had planned. He could probably do it faster, but this would work so much better if he took his time. &quot;This has already come to pass.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;What you speak of is madness.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe,&quot; he allowed as he began siphoning the magical energy from the wards placed on him into his weapon systems and linked them to a specific weapon in particular. &quot;But it still works. If it didn&#039;t, I wouldn&#039;t exist. My creator is an earth pony. Without your son&#039;s philosophy in place, he&#039;d have been just another farm worker toiling away in the fields.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;It would have been his place,&quot;</b> the centaur glared. <b>&quot;Those meant for growing food have no need for scholarly pursuits.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;The fact that our farmers now can produce more food, of higher quality, and with less farmers, than anyone from your time would have believed possible suggests otherwise,&quot; Rock grinned as new magical energy began to flow into his systems. He&#039;d need everything he could get. &quot;But beyond that, your son believed that everyone, regardless of species or station, not only deserved a chance to learn, but a chance to live and prove themselves.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;A folly,&quot;</b> Tirek Sunstar scoffed. <b>&quot;Once the taint of darkness has taken root, only the purifying flame can cleanse it.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;And there&#039;s our impasse,&quot; Rock nodded calmly. &quot;You believe in no chances to anyone who doesn&#039;t fit your definition of &#039;pure&#039;. I believe that everyone deserves not just <i>a</i> chance, but often also a <i>second</i> chance. It&#039;s why I&#039;ll risk my life even for a mortal enemy. We may falter into darkness along the way, but with a little faith and the help of friends we can come back into the light. It&#039;s the kind of world your son spent his life trying to create.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;My son was a fool. As are any who place their faith in his folly. Such madness can never be Just.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;And I say that such &#039;madness&#039; is what <i>creates</i> Justice!&quot; Rock shot back. &quot;So I&#039;m here to challenge you, Tirek Sunstar, last of an outdated and obsolete philosophy! A duel! Your Justice against mine! You take your best shot and then I take mine!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s all I can give him,&quot; Twilight let out a long breath. &quot;I hope your brother knows what he&#039;s doing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, since we started looping, Rock has faced various versions of Sunstar hundreds of times,&quot; Roll replied calmly.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked and reminded herself once again that for some loopers such opponents were the norm rather than the &#039;once in a weird variant&#039; exception.</p><p class="double">&quot;He hasn&#039;t lost yet.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Light&#039;s boy is out of his mind,&#039;</i> Dr. Wily thought numbly as he abandoned stealth in favor of putting more distance between himself and the showdown. Only to run face first into Break Mane.</p><p class="double">Standing next to the lunar diarch herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not so fast, doc,&quot; the renegade prototype smirked. &quot;We&#039;ve still got some things to discuss after this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Luna agreed as she absently restrained the doctor with her magic.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rock didn&#039;t normally engage in psychological warfare, but as a pragmatic tool-using model, he naturally considered everything at his disposal when presented with a problem. That his goading had not only secured Tirek Sunstar&#039;s undivided attention, but his agreement to the duel he&#039;d proposed was just step one. The easy step.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Cross-wire with the Magnet Beam... Adjust frequency to optimal dispersal of enemy&#039;s energy weapon... Initiate thaumic energy boost from existing wards and infused magic...&#039;</i> he performed the final adjustments as Sunstar took his time dramatically gathering energy. <i>&#039;Energy readings stable... Backup contingencies in place... Yes, I want to override my blasted safeties already... Pray like heck this guy&#039;s as superstitious as he sounds like...&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Tirek Sunstar leveled his hands and the gathered energy between them in his direction and fired.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Skull Barrier.&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tirek Sunstar experienced a feeling of vindication as the insolent blue golem was consumed by his holy flame. There was, after all, only one true Justice an–</p><p class="double">He stared in shock as a shimmering glow of power not his own became visible as his flames died down. The shock grew as the shimmering became clearer to show it had a shape. The shape of an equine skull forming a protective barrier over the metal golem. His holy flames licked at the energy hungrily, but it held firm.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Impossible! None may possess the favor of Death! Even I in my Holy and Just cause was refused!&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;H-how do you possess the favor of Death?!&quot;</b> Tirek demanded. <b>&quot;HOW?!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe because I go out of my way to not make work for him,&quot; Rock retorted as he took stock. The forelimb he&#039;d used to generate the barrier had blown almost every circuit it had to pump power into the shield, but it had worked. Even better, Tirek believed it was some divine favor from the local equivalent of the grim reaper. The damaged forelimb, while otherwise useless, could still support his weight and his other forelimb was still in good working order. He could work with that. &quot;Anyway, that was your best shot, right?&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Your contest is the dishonorable rambling of a tainted mind!&quot;</b> Tirek fumed as Rock raised his remaining forelimb, formed it into a hoof cannon, and took aim. The centaur began to form energy in his hands, sloppily from his anger. <b>&quot;Even were you able to harm me, I am not bound by your treasonous barg–&quot;</b></p><p class="double">He was cut off by an explosion in his face and lost control of his flame, but even Rock could see he was more dazed than hurt.</p><p class="double"><i><b>&quot;That</b></i><i> </i><i><b>is your best shot?&quot;</b></i> Tirek Sunstar challenged.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, that was just to get your attention,&quot; Rock stated flatly. &quot;My best shot... is everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that pronouncement, the robot known as Mega Mane proceeded to, in fact, shoot everything at his opponent.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared at where Rock, the Mega Mane was blasting everything at Tirek Sunstar. He switched weapons so fast that his color-changing armor looked like a rainbow having a spasm (25) as it tried to match each one for the instant it was in use.</p><p class="double">Bombs flew after fire flew after ice flew after blades flew after water flew after lightning and on and on creating a giant blur of elemental violence that pummeled the living sun.</p><p class="double">&quot;How...?&quot; Twilight tried to make sense of what she was seeing. Tirek Sunstar had seemed almost invincible before, but now he was looking like an amateur. Every shot he tried to fire back was countered before it even left his hand or flew so wide that it seemed the safest place to stand was directly behind the robot firing on him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because that&#039;s what my brother does,&quot; Roll replied next to her. &quot;Blues may be military and I may take to fighting styles better than Rock, but this is what he&#039;s the best at. He analyzes everything about his opponents. Their powers, their patterns, their tells, their attitude, the way their armor moves and fits together, all of it. He studies them as he fights, and then when he&#039;s got everything he needs, he uses it to take them apart.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh,&quot; Twilight mulled that over. &quot;I wonder what goes through his mind at times like this?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;I swear, one of these days I&#039;m going to end up copying a weapon that shoots kitchen sinks,&#039;</i> Rock mused as he monitored the armor integrity of his opponent. His ability to control and direct his solar flames should be reaching bottom right about...</p><p class="double">Tirek fell to his knees.</p><p class="double">...now.</p><p class="double">Rock stopped firing.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;It... appears that victory is indeed yours,&quot;</b> Tirek admitted reluctantly from where he knelt involuntarily. <b>&quot;I almost feel remorse that for you it shall be a bitter one.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">Rock could hear the smile in the centaur&#039;s voice and it sent alarms blaring through his mind.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Almost.&quot;</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna went rigid as she felt the magic of Tirek Sunstar shift and teleported herself, her companion, and her captive directly to Twilight&#039;s side.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle,&quot; she rushed, &quot;it appears we have made an error most grave, our foe&#039;s power–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Isn&#039;t dissipating safely, I know,&quot; Twilight was starting to go pale. &quot;It&#039;s going critical.&quot; <i>&#039;If he blows, it&#039;ll ignite the entire atmosphere!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">And if her scan was correct, they had a little over fifteen minutes before the world ended.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t have to do this!&quot; Rock pleaded. &quot;The world your son dreamed of can be yours too! We can give you a second chance! A chance to live in peace and harmony!&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;He he he...&quot;</b> Tirek chuckled. <b>&quot;I was wrong. You are not tainted. Merely hopelessly naive. Like my son. But I would not stop my holy quest for him and I shall not for you. I swore an oath to cleanse this world, one that I ensured I would be able to keep even with my dying breath.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">A rainbow light from the Elements of Harmony chose to strike him at that moment, but even now Tirek Sunstar proved unmovable to the supreme expression of light magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;It is over!&quot; the centaur laughed madly. &quot;There is nothing you can do to stop it! The world shall be cleansed!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Damnit!&#039;</i> Twilight fumed as her telekinesis failed to grasp the centaur every bit as the last use of the Elements did. And even if she could fling him away, would she get his high enough fast enough? &quot;ARGH! I don&#039;t know what to do! Tirek&#039;s going to blow sky high and burn the whole world to a cinder and I can&#039;t stop it! Why are the Elements not working?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What if we reversed them?&quot; Rainbow Dash suddenly spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think putting them on backwards will do anything, darling,&quot; Rarity was close to hyperventilating and trying to hide it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we gotta try somethin&#039;!&quot; Applejack started fiddling with her necklace, clearly intending to do what Rarity had claimed was pointless.</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; Rainbow shook her head. &quot;I mean, why don&#039;t we reverse us? Like instead of focusing our positive traits through the Elements, we focus our negative ones? This guy is all light, right? Well, Blues was telling me a while back that all light isn&#039;t very harmonious.&quot; She pointed her hoof at Luna before continuing. &quot;Like day needs the night to balance it out, we all have darker shadowy sides to ourselves to balance out the traits the Elements represent. So why can&#039;t we use <i>those</i> to blast him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I...&quot; Twilight stopped herself from saying that it wouldn&#039;t work as she realized she hadn&#039;t actually <i>tried</i> that in looping memory. There hadn&#039;t ever been any need to. She racked her mind for everything she knew about the Elements for a few seconds and concluded that none of it would render the action <i>impossible</i>. Difficult and unlikely, perhaps, but not impossible. &quot;What negative traits were you thinking of?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Rarity&#039;s clearly got Ambition,&quot; Rainbow Dash began.</p><p class="double">&quot;But of course, darling,&quot; Rarity huffed. &quot;Nothing wrong with wanting to be the pinnacle of fabulousness, is there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, of course not,&quot; Dash agreed, &quot;but that&#039;s not the point. Where Generosity is all about others, Ambition is all about yourself. But they&#039;re linked, see? Generosity wants to give and Ambition wants to have, but you can&#039;t give what you don&#039;t have.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see...&quot; Rarity hemmed a bit, before brightening. &quot;Oh, my. I <i>do</i> see!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy&#039;s normally kind,&quot; Dash continued, &quot;and that&#039;s great, but it&#039;s not what we need right now. We need Ferocity. Not the gentle healer that mends hurts, but the angry mama bear that stops them by ripping the hurter a new one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Fluttershy&#039;s gaze hardened as she thought to her adopted son of another Loop and the trials he regularly underwent. &quot;If that&#039;s what&#039;s needed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, you gotta give up Laughter for a bit and do Sorrow instead,&quot; the blue pegasus continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;But Dashie, you know I don&#039;t do sad!&quot; Pinkie smiled, a bit confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pull the other one, Pinks,&quot; Dash retorted. &quot;You&#039;re the friendliest mare I know. You care about pretty much everypony. So how would you feel if we just... weren&#039;t there one day? If we were dead, or we&#039;d left without saying goodbye, or–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, you&#039;re right,&quot; Pinkie admitted as her mane deflated and her eyes teared up. But she was still smiling, sadly, but smiling. &quot;I&#039;d be really sad if that happened. So, yeah, I can be sad for a friend.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what about me?&quot; Applejack snorted. &quot;Honesty don&#039;t do well with lyin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, but valuing the truth means understanding Deception,&quot; Dash folded her forelimbs. &quot;And self-deception counts miss &#039;Sure I can buck the whole field, I just gotta give up on little things like eating and sleeping&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, I deserved that,&quot; Applejack admitted. She&#039;d honestly thought she could pull that off without her fancy looping powers this time. She hadn&#039;t counted on waking up in the hospital with Nurse Redheart giving her a nasty look and no memory of when and how she collapsed. Maybe this &#039;deception&#039; wasn&#039;t lying outright, it was understanding how what was true and what wasn&#039;t could get muddled up in someone&#039;s head. That she certainly had experience with. &quot;Looks like ya got my number after all. But what about you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me?&quot; the Unawake Element of Loyalty rolled her eyes as if it was obvious. &quot;I&#039;ve got Suspiscion out the wazoo. I don&#039;t easily trust anypony outside my group of friends. It&#039;s part of how I look out for all of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And me?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;How do you reverse Magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh,&quot; Dash chuckled. &quot;You know that Magic used to be referred to as what the Magi knew?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Twilight&#039;s Unawake self had known about the legendary Magi unicorns for a while, &quot;but I don&#039;t... Oh. Oh! Duh! You&#039;re saying my Element&#039;s not just about friendship, it&#039;s about knowledge!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, you love learning all that egghead stuff Twi,&quot; Rainbow poked her with a hoof. &quot;But where the positive is learning new things and discovering stuff, the negative is keeping it all to yourself. And don&#039;t tell me you don&#039;t play it close to the chest sometimes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed as Rainbow hit the nail on the head. How many times had she told her friends, Awake or otherwise, to trust her, she knew what she was doing? She <i>didn&#039;t</i> share everything with them. And she&#039;d gotten really good at keeping secrets. &quot;I... I think this could actually work. Okay, places girls! We&#039;ve got a world to save!&quot;</p><p class="double">They got into formation one more time, this time doing their best to focus on the not-so-bright parts of themselves that they were often loath to admit to. The Elements didn&#039;t respond at first, but slowly they began to darken and then radiate a shadowy &#039;light&#039;. Each of them rose up in turn as the shadows grew in strength and intensity, the Elements shaking in protest.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;It&#039;s working, but the Elements weren&#039;t designed to do this,&#039;</i> Twilight observed. She almost told the others, but stopped herself. <i>&#039;Telling them won&#039;t improve our chances. They don&#039;t need to know yet.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">With that re-affirmation of her darker personality trait, the Elements reached the peak of their power and a Rainbow of Shadows burst forth and struck the downed Tirek Sunstar and began to struggle with him.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Ergh!&#039;</i> Twiligth grunted. <i>&#039;He&#039;s still resisting! Turning to stone... Yeah, what body? He&#039;s a living fusion reaction! Cleansing of his overly light nature and madness? Ngh... No, we aren&#039;t putting out enough force with this setting. Banishment...? Moon&#039;s refusing a connection. He&#039;s too solar. Gotta be the sun... Gah!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Luna!&quot; Twilight managed to force out as she maintained the Rainbow of Shadows under the protesting Elements. &quot;We need to banish him to the sun, but the connection&#039;s... not strong enough at night! You gotta raise...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If thou needst the sun to rise, then it shall be so!&quot; Luna declared and focused all of her might on forcing the newly-set sun back over the horizon. Slowly, the western horizon changed color as the sun reversed course, and as the first rays peaked over, the connection was made and Tirek Sunstar was blasted off the planet in a trail of shadows. Straight for the sun.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tirek Sunstar, the most Holy and Just being in all the world, raged as he was deposited in the sun&#039;s fiery furnace. It didn&#039;t harm him, any more than the sea would harm a bucket&#039;s worth of water, but it also didn&#039;t stop his armor&#039;s containment from failing. He was Holy! His cause was Just! The world needed to be cleans–</p><p class="double">Within the sun, Tirek Sunstar exploded with a fury that would have ended all life on the world he just came from and burnt what remained to cinders.</p><p class="double">The sun didn&#039;t notice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;We... We won...&quot; Twilight heaved from the exertion forcing the Elements to perform in a way never intended had put her through.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The trip back to Canterlot had happened much faster then the trip out. With Dr. Light&#039;s teleportation network back up, each of the robots was able to take a passenger back with them. Dr. Wily was firmly in custody, but Ahuizotl had somehow slipped off in the aftermath despite his injuries. Daring was certain he&#039;d turn up again. He always did.</p><p class="double">Rock had been rushed to the makeshift lab Dr. Light had set up for repairs, with Roll and the Cossack numbers patiently awaiting their turns. Blues had claimed that he could manage his own repairs just fine and had promptly vanished.</p><p class="double">Luna had stubbornly refused a regeneration spell for her hoof, claiming that battle scars were to be worn with pride. Celestia had managed to at least talk her into begrudgingly trying one of the latest prosthetics in lieu of healing after much worrying and shedding of tears.</p><p class="double">As for the Elements of Harmony and co, they were taking some well-earned relaxation time. Or at least as much relaxation as could be had with Dash and Gilda retelling the adventure to an insistent CMC, and their griffon guest Kalinka, with increasingly ludicrous embellishments on each retelling. Twilight had ten bits on their narrative having the planet explode within the next five revisions.</p><p class="double">Daring Do on the other hoof was holed up translating a holographic scan of the writings in the temple. She seemed very excited about it. Excited enough that Twilight was on edge waiting for her to finish and tell the rest of them.</p><p class="double">Dr. Wily Plan... was awaiting trial.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Forsooth, yon skills are most impressive Master Light,&quot; Luna complimented the scientist as she idly flexed the gleaming cybernetic prosthesis now replacing her incinerated hoof. &quot;Were it not for the loss of touch, we wouldst be incapable of perceiving the difference.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, your body does already know what your limb is supposed to be doing,&quot; Dr. Light tried to deflect the praise. &quot;It&#039;s just a matter of making it so the device lets it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thy humility does thee credit, Master Light,&quot; Luna smiled. &quot;But one shouldst not understate their own skills ei–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Doc!&quot; Rainbow Dash sped into the room and halted for a moment at the sight of the lunar diarch. &quot;Er... Hey, Luna. Sorry to interrupt, but Daring says she&#039;s got that ancient writing stuff translated and wants to invite everypony to hear it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That sounds most intriguing,&quot; Dr. Light rubbed his bearded chin thoughtfully. &quot;What do you think, princess?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We do think we would like to hear the ancient tale of the Magi and the tyrant sun as written by the Magi themselves,&quot; Luna replied eagerly. &quot;Let us make haste!&quot;</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; Daring nodded to the room. The Elements of Harmony, all three princesses, the Light family, the Cossack family, a few of the guard (including the captain), some assorted robots, and a group of fillies tagging along filled the meeting hall. Behind her, a hologram of one of the walls in the Lanfront appeared. &quot;As you know, I have been working to translate the writings of the Lanfront ruins for the past few days. Just so you know, this is an ancient written language, so mistakes tend to be made. One of the problems with them is that they&#039;re all nouns and verbs, and are just starting to grasp the concept of adjectives. Things like pronous, adjectives, connecting words, and all the other little things we take for granted are supposed to be gleaned from context and word ordering. So I hope you&#039;ll forgive me for embellishing a little.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;This is the fate of the tyrant Sunstar, whose light consumes all it touches. Once, he was a good and noble being, but the trials of leading the world&#039;s races and the dying curse of the mad queen turned him into a mockery of himself. And so I, Le Tor, his son in heart if not in body, formed the Magi to save the world from its savior.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;The Magi were dedicated to the idea that all have a right to seek enlightenment and so I invited members of every race to come and study the deepest reaches of power and wisdom. To gleen hidden knowledge by which we could both protect the races of the world and teach them to protect themselves.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;We mastered the forces of nature first. The storms in the heavens, the cleansing power of the seas, the strength of the earth, and the flames of the world&#039;s core. We even learned to move the sun and moon by our own might and to contain the most dreaded of beings.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;But the tyrant Sunstar shed his mortal form and became a living sun, declaring himself the only light the world needed. He declared entire races tainted and began to hunt them down without cause. He had to be stopped, but his form was proof against light magic. And so the Magi created a prison of darkness to hold light most foul. Its power shall endure as long as the tyrant Sunstar&#039;s immortal flame burns.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I, the alicorn Le Tor, led the force that defeated him, and he fell cursing us all for eternity. Myself most of all. In his words, my life was one of the mad queen&#039;s last foul wishes, and I had proven myself her son at last. I am troubled by this.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;This is where the writing style shifts,&quot; Daring explained, breaking the narrative. &quot;Le Tor&#039;s entries end and someone else continues for him.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;The Magi have been betrayed. The great alicorn Le Tor, may his spirit rest in the boundless heavens, brought us together under the banner of equality and friendship, but it seems not all wished to share the secret knowledge we have gained. Lord Silver and his wife Platinum were invited as the represetatives of the unicorns for their ability to channel mystical forces through their horns, but now it is clear they never thought of the rest of us as equals. We were merely tools to be used and then discarded when no longer of use.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;With the tyrant Sunstar imprisoned, they grew bold. Le Tor, the only one who would claim we demons of Ahuizotl as friends, was slain in his sleep. Spykoran of the dragons fell to pyrite poisoning. The others were killed most cowardly one by one until only I, the nameless demon of Ahuizotl, remained. I have used the power of the prison to seal this place against intruders. The lust for power that Lord Silver, Lady Platinum, and their unicorn followers possess is endless and their selfishness regarding the knowledge meant for all is beyond reasoning. They have taken everything, including the name of the Magi, for themselves. There is naught I can do but leave this record in the hopes that one day the truth will be known.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">The room was silent for several moments after that.</p><p class="double">&quot;What does the &#039;nameless demon of Ahuizotl&#039; mean?&quot; Dash asked first. &quot;I mean, that guy can&#039;t be <i>that</i> old, can he?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Daring shook her head. &quot;Though the symbol Ahuizotl always uses for himself is the only reason I recognized the word. My guess is it&#039;s a place that his species was originally from. As for the &#039;nameless&#039; thing, it doesn&#039;t translate well. The word would more literally mean &#039;one who has given up his name to serve his fellows&#039;, an honored title for the time, but that&#039;s a bit of a mouthful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Celestia agreed. &quot;This would be quite controversial in many circles, I&#039;m sure you all understand, but the events fit what we know to have come after.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The tale of Hearth&#039;s Warming,&quot; Twilight supplied.</p><p class="double">&quot;Quite so,&quot; Celestia nodded. &quot;Speaking of which my student, I was meaning to ask if you and your friends would like to perform in Canterlot&#039;s annual production of the tale this winter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WOULD WE?!&quot; Pinkie&#039;s instant agreement drowned out any other replies.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The trial had been surprisingly swift despite the complicated nature of the events. Dr. Wily had been incredibly subdued after being caught in the backwash of the Elements when Tirek was banished. He had remained that way since their return from the ruins and he sat through the court proceedings seemingly resigned to his fate. He hadn&#039;t even attempted to defend himself, pleading guilty right off the bat. Rock and Roll allowed as to how it was very uncharacteristic of the stallion.</p><p class="double">Even now as the sentence was being hoofed down, his head hung despondent and barely responsive.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dr. Wily Plan,&quot; Judge Scales proclaimed from the bench, &quot;after reviewing the evidence and the testimony of all involved parties, this court does hereby accept your plea of guilty to the crime of assault upon the sovereign lands of Equestria. However, due to the influence of the dark magic known as the &#039;Nightmare Force&#039; upon your mind and the precedent set by The Ponies of Equestria vs Luna Equis several months prior, leniency has been granted in sentencing. You are hereby on probation for a term of no less than five years. You will be remanded to the custody of Light Labs and are not to be unsupervised at any time. Do you understand?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; Dr. Wily stated without emotion. &quot;Thank you, your honor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dismissed!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s weird,&quot; Rock was telling Twilight later when they were away from non-looping ears. &quot;I&#039;ve <i>never</i> seen Dr. Wily like that. Usually he&#039;s clinging to the possibility of his innocence with all the fervor of a raccoon with its hand stuck in a bottle because it won&#039;t let go of the thing it reached in to get.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a pretty long-winded metaphor,&quot; Twilight snorted in amusement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I need to work on those,&quot; Rock rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. &quot;But still, Wily likes to take any avenue to protest his innocence. Sometimes while he&#039;s plotting his next scheme at the same time. But sometimes he really is the innocent victim of manipulation, at least initially, and usually I&#039;m right there getting the evidence to help prove it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;About that,&quot; Twilight interrupted, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because of all the ways we keep trying to reform him, this second chance is the one that&#039;s repeatedly come the closest to working,&quot; Rock lamented.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, he <i>did</i> get the backwash of the elements this time,&quot; Twilight theorized.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m hoping that does the trick,&quot; the blue bomber nodded. &quot;But, well, we&#039;ll see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose we will,&quot; the purple unicorn agreed. &quot;Also, I&#039;ve been meaning to ask you about that last stand against Tirek Sunstar. How did you know it would work?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I didn&#039;t know for sure,&quot; Rock admitted. &quot;That&#039;s why I had the Chaos Emeralds in my subspace pocket on standby so I could go Super just in case it didn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at her fellow Anchor for a long moment, her eye twitching. &quot;And precisely <i>when</i> were you going to tell me you had those?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rock blinked. &quot;I thought I had... Right after... No, not the parasprite incident... It was after Wily&#039;s second attack... Let&#039;s see, there was the thing with Philomena... Why is this encrypted...? Ah! Right after you and the other Awake loopers took us into the Everfree to show off your alicorn forms.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehooved. &quot;Rock, we were drunk off our plots that day. We were lucky we remembered <i>anything</i> that happened then.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right, <i>that&#039;s</i> why those memories were encrypted,&quot; Rock made a face. &quot;I did <i>not</i> need to remember Rarity and Spike doing that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am <i>so</i> jealous of you right now,&quot; Twilight grumbled. &quot;But still, if you had those, why didn&#039;t you use them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because while the Super form is cool and all, it&#039;s still one of the &#039;nuclear&#039; options and I don&#039;t like using those if I don&#039;t absolutely have to,&quot; Rock explained. &quot;I don&#039;t particularly like fighting to begin with, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that,&quot; Twilight latched into the fact about her new friend that had been bugging her all Loop. &quot;That&#039;s what I can&#039;t quite figure out about you. You know our offer of sanctuary is on the table, but you never want to take it. You&#039;ve insisted on handling Dr. Wily your way and we&#039;ve honored that so long as it doesn&#039;t get too far out of hoof, like this last time. But you&#039;re not an adventure junkie like some loopers we get who like to be &#039;hooves-on&#039;. You&#039;re more like the crowd who get thrust into wars they don&#039;t want and desperately need a respite from all the craziness and fighting in their home Loops, a place to rest where they don&#039;t have to rush out and save the world every time a threat rears its head. Honestly, it might have been harder than usual, but I think we could have taken care Dr. Wily, his robots, the StarDruids, and even Sunstar without you. Probably even without giving your antagonistic Dreamer knowledge of anything more dangerous than he already has. So why don&#039;t you take it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve tried it a few times,&quot; Rock admitted. &quot;A few Loops when my sister was Awake and I&#039;d felt weary of the whole thing we agreed that she&#039;d be &#039;Mega Woman&#039; and I&#039;d be just the brother who stayed back and supported from the sidelines. I wasn&#039;t too bad at it either. I got to develop some neat stuff for my sister with dad during the Loop too, but every time Roll went out, I&#039;d worry. I know she can take care of herself, especially now, but staying back while someone else did all the hard and dangerous work just... felt wrong. It still does. I... I can&#039;t <i>not</i> save the world when I have the power to do so, Twilight. It just isn&#039;t in me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight didn&#039;t reply for several long seconds. Rock&#039;s attitude was one she could relate to. It was why they&#039;d offered their Loop as a sanctuary in the first place. It was why they went above and beyond the original offer when those like Leah Clearwater and Kakashi landed in Equestria. They couldn&#039;t <i>not</i> help others who needed it.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... I guess I can understand that.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dr. Wily watched listlessly as Dr. Cossack and his daughter bid farewell before teleporting home. Nothing seemed to matter anymore since he&#039;d had that moment of clarity. He&#039;d allowed jealousy to overcome his reason and lead him down a foolish path, and for what? To drag what little good name he had through the mud? To prove to the world that genius like his came with dangerous madness?</p><p class="double">&quot;Wily Plan?&quot; the voice of his long-time friend, did he even deserve such a thing?, cut into his thoughts.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it, To-Bright Light?&quot; he responded without feeling. Nothing seemed important anymore. He&#039;d failed as thoroughly as it was possible to fail.</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s something I want you to see, my friend,&quot; Bright Light smiled warmly. &quot;A project I need your help on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What kind of project?&quot; Dr. Wily asked despite his depression as he followed his friend and colleague. &quot;What could you possibly... Why do you have an elevator in a one-floor lab?&quot;</p><p class="double">That hadn&#039;t been there before...</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s part of what I need to show you,&quot; Dr. Light smiled as the doors opened. Dr. Wily felt something like a ghost of his old spark. Curiosity. The driving force of all discovery. What did this lead to?</p><p class="double">He followed.</p><p class="double">&quot;After your first...&quot; Light began before stopping himself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Invasion, Bright Light,&quot; Wily huffed as the elevator began to descend at a slow pace. &quot;Call it what it was.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, that,&quot; Light agreed without actually saying the word. &quot;After that, Celestia approached me with a proposition. Tell me, are you familiar with the legend of the Lord of Chaos?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord?&quot; Wily wrinkled his nose in disgust. &quot;A cautionary fable about disharmony with no basis in fact.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, much like Nightmare Moon,&quot; Light smiled. &quot;Or Tirek Sunstar. Apparently he&#039;s quite real. And the seal keeping him imprisoned is weakening.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because of me, right?&quot; Wily sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your actions didn&#039;t do it any favors, no,&quot; Light admitted, &quot;but it would have weakened all the same. Anyway, the seal cannot be renewed without breaking it first, and only the Elements themselves can do so deliberately. And while Celestia has faith in the current bearers, she neither wishes to disrupt their lives with the knowledge nor does she wish to place all her faith in one solution. So she commissioned Light Labs to create an anti-Discord countermeasure. She has even allowed the use of normally forbidden magical artifacts, specifically ones supposedly designed to counter Chaos magic, to ensure it succeeds.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What kind of countermeasure?&quot; Wily asked as he noted the elevator was still descending. Even it it was slow, they should have reached their destination by now. How far down did this go?</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I was hoping the support units could be those robot masters we designed together,&quot; Light smiled at him. &quot;Which I would of course need your help to build.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Wily agreed, beginning to feel a small portion of his old enthusiasm. &quot;And the main unit?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Light started, only to be interrupted as the elevator finally stopped. &quot;Ah, we&#039;re here. How about you see for yourself?&quot;</p><p class="double">Wily stepped out of the doors and looked up. And up. And higher up still. At the frame of a truly gigantic robot. How had his old friend found the time to make <i>this?!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Wily, my friend,&quot; Light introduced happily, &quot;meet Project Gamma.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">*) Theme song plus extended lyrics version by kajisora.</p><p class="double">1) Pansy had decided to take a nap for the Loop instead of getting put into a body of her own. Though Scoots put a few notes into her subspace pocket to help with the &#039;mobile armor of the founders&#039; project next time she and Applebloom were Awake together.</p><p class="double">2) Silver-Bot apparently got the &#039;understatement&#039; upgrade.</p><p class="double">3) Like Bertie Bott&#039;s Every Flavor Beans. Don&#039;t ask.</p><p class="double">4) Rainbow Dash: Light Labs assistant. She helps put the pony-oriented inventions through their paces.

<p>95.1</p><p class="double">“Sleipnir?” Twilight asked, nervously. “Do you have a moment?”</p><p class="double">The admin turned from his drink (a plasmated ion residue in cordial, exactly the kind of thing that wouldn&#039;t be possible for a mortal pony to drink. He&#039;d got a good recommendation off of Spike for it.) “Certainly, Twilight. What can I help you with?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Twilight rummaged in her Pocket and pulled out a sheet of paper. “Okay, I tried to work out how much... experience, my memory has. You know, because I&#039;ve lived a <i>really</i> long time counting all the loops, and while I can remember some of it better than other bits, there seems to be a lot of knowledge in there.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, I see.” Sleipnir looked over the calculations. “Yes, that&#039;s about right.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s the thing.” Twilight tapped the side of her head. “I&#039;m fairly sure this is still metabiological, and I can&#039;t store that much information unless the data storage density is pretty close to computronium.”</p><p class="double">The eight-legged horse deity contemplated that for a moment. Then he took a sip of his drink, belched fire (politely) and put the glass down. “Right. I did wonder if you&#039;d worked that side of it out. Well, you&#039;re right. That <i>is</i> more information than your brain can hold.”</p><p class="double">“So...” Twilight prompted.</p><p class="double">“So we use your local brain as... well, the word &#039;client&#039; is wrong but convenient. It&#039;s all there, and the stuff you&#039;re actually using is loaded to your local memory, but things you didn&#039;t have any idea you might need sometimes take a moment to be loaded. It&#039;s functionally identical to having to rack your brains to remember something.” Sleipnir smiled weakly. “All I can say is, it <i>does</i> work. And we did do tests back when we first set the system going – there&#039;s no difference between one kind of memory and another from your point of view.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Twilight digested that. “Well, that&#039;s vaguely unsettling, but mainly because it sounds all a bit Celest-AI-ish. How do the situations with Lyra and Ditzy tie into that model?”</p><p class="double">“Lyra... well, pushing the analogy too far, all her requests to the &#039;server&#039; come back with more information than she was after.” Sleipnir shrugged helplessly. “We&#039;re trying to patch it, but whatever she did means we&#039;re having to parse core dumps. You do <i>not</i> want to see a core dump from an Yggdrasil client server...”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll take your word for it. And Ditzy?”</p><p class="double">“We just don&#039;t know either.” An eight-legged shrug. “Honestly, since she seems perfectly happy, that one&#039;s a <i>long</i> way down the priority list.”</p><p class="double">“Right, I can see why that would be.” Twilight grinned. “Okay, I&#039;ve kept you long enough. Go enjoy your time off.”</p><p class="double">“Aye, aye, Anchor.” The eldest son of Asgard&#039;s trickster saluted, and swept up the drink he&#039;d left in a spare leg. “Actually, is there a Wonderbolts show on?”</p><p class="double">Seeing her surprise, he bobbed his head. “I&#039;m as impressed by what mortals do in baseline as anything. Achievements like that in such a short time...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">95.2</p><p class="double">“Hey, Twilight?” Spike asked, as she put the book down.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Twilight replied, turning.</p><p class="double">“Well... I noticed something about this loop.” Spike frowned, then nodded. “Just confirmed. Zecora, Berry, Trix, Chrysalis and Gilda are all Awake too.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, I see. Second team?” Twilight was already thinking of strategies. “Fine by me. Go ahead and let the others know.”</p><p class="double">Spike began fire-sending messages.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Around two that afternoon, in Ponyville, a large, complicated cart wheeled into town drawn by two bickering ponies and one stoically silent zebra.</p><p class="double">“Wotcha,” called a griffin from the cart&#039;s second story lookout. “We&#039;re the travelling circus.”</p><p class="double">“...that&#039;s a circus?” Roseluck asked, dubious.</p><p class="double">“No, that&#039;s a cart full of things and stuff. The circus is the sorry lot we are.” She flared her wings and dove off the cart, coming to a neat four-point landing just in front of the ongoing argument. “Oh, just kiss and make up already, you two.”</p><p class="double">The blue unicorn and black-green pegasus left off their arguing for long enough to make rude gestures at her, then went right back to bickering.</p><p class="double">“They just do it so they don&#039;t have to contemplate how lucky they are to have each other,” the griffin stage-whispered. “Anyway, we&#039;ve got some stuff to sell, some things to buy, and some complicated acquaintances to discharge here in Ponyville. My name&#039;s Gilda, these two are Chrys and Trix, the rhyming one is Zecora – she does a nice line in hangover cures – and together we are... mostly unemployed.”</p><p class="double">She stretched, cricking her neck. “But enough of that, I&#039;ve been working hard all day. Where&#039;s the pub?”</p><p class="double">“Excuse <i>me</i>?” Trix broke off her argument to start a new one, because she was able to multi-task like that. “You haven&#039;t done any work since we set off this morning.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve been looking out. It&#039;s an important job, lookout. Really.”</p><p class="double">The others gave her dubious looks.</p><p class="double">“If any believed that &#039;round here, Trix would sell them a bridge, I fear,” Zecora said, thus demonstrating that she could in fact rhyme.</p><p class="double">“Did somepony ask where the pub was?” asked local hard-drinking mare Berry Punch.</p><p class="double">“Oh, cool, you know where it is?” Gilda replied. “Shush, guys, I think I found a pub.”</p><p class="double">“Good,” Chrys remarked. “I&#039;m parched.”</p><p class="double">“Well, not so much <i>is</i> as... <i>will be</i>,” Berry hedged. “Give me half an hour for the renovation work.”</p><p class="double">“When that is done, we start the fun.” Zecora nodded to herself. “I&#039;ll pay the fee – first drinks on me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And how did you say they&#039;d recruited you?” Twilight asked dubiously.</p><p class="double">“They challenged me to a drinking contest.” Spike grinned. “Easy. And they&#039;re settling into Ponyville life like they&#039;ve always been here. Turns out, buying everyone in town about ten drinks each is perfect for making them feel warm and fuzzy towards you...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As soon as Nightmare Moon had left, Trixie clambered onto a table.</p><p class="double">“Attention, ponies of Ponyville!” she called. “I, the great and unbelievably humble Trixie-”</p><p class="double">“The idea that you&#039;re humble is indeed unbelievable,” Chrysalis muttered.</p><p class="double">Trixie ignored her. “And her entourage, will solve this crisis!”</p><p class="double">“Are we an entourage?” Gilda asked, frowning. “I thought we were a corporation.”</p><p class="double">“Details!” Trixie pronounced. “Come! We canter for justice!”</p><p class="double">“Can I fly for justice instead?” Gilda requested.</p><p class="double">“I second that,” Spike lent his own two bits.</p><p class="double">“Fine.” Trixie gave them a quick glare. “Those with wings may fly for justice instead.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I could have done that,” Chrysalis grumbled good-naturedly as Spike carried them all down from the cliff.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know,” Spike replied, wings flaring as he alighted. “But this was easier. You snooze, you lose.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Zecora?” Trixie said, a note of fear in her voice. (It was for the audience.) “What are these things?”</p><p class="double">Zecora sniffed, disdaining the reaching branches. She then took out a vial, splashed some on a tree-limb, and noted the colour of the smoke.</p><p class="double">Then she cleared her throat.</p><p class="double">“I think I understand your fear.</p><p>But there is no true evil here.</p><p>This nasty confusion</p><p>Is but an illusion</p><p>Now just use dispel magic, dear.”</p><p class="double">Trixie gave her a look, then flared her horn and fired off a spell.</p><p class="double">The hemispherical wave of countermagic licked over the motley group, passing over Chrysalis&#039; disguise without a blip. It then slammed into the evil trees, and made them vanish.</p><p class="double">“A limerick? Really?” Trixie demanded, seeming honestly offended.</p><p class="double">Zecora shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“My turn!” Gilda announced, running forwards with Thunder Edge flashing out of nowhere to hover across her back. “Oh, it&#039;s been ages since I got to have one of these!”</p><p class="double">The manticore roared at her.</p><p class="double">Gilda roared back, then got to work.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Five complicated (and probably Not Safe For Fluttershy) minutes later, Gilda knocked the thorn clean out of the manticore&#039;s paw with a sword blow that hit like a freight train.</p><p class="double">The manticore showed its gratitude by passing out. Gilda hadn&#039;t actually used the edge of her lightning sword on it, but the flat had still given it a hay of a beating.</p><p class="double">“Well?” she asked, rejoining the others.</p><p class="double">Spike waved a claw. “Three out of five.”</p><p class="double">“Watch it, scalebutt.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“My poor moustache!” the sea serpent moaned. “I was so close to breaking the record!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;s pretty harsh,” Berry agreed. “Another beer?”</p><p class="double">“Yes please.” Steven sniffed, then took the proffered keg, scored the lid open with a claw, and took a swig.</p><p class="double">Berry waited five seconds, then nodded to herself at the <i>thud</i>.</p><p class="double">“Okay, he should be out for the rest of the day,” she called. “That was azerotropic ethanol with food colouring, and he was pretty close to passing out anyway.”</p><p class="double">“This feels kind of like cheating,” Chrysalis mused. “Which I&#039;m all for.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Come with us...” a voice whispered through the fog. “We&#039;re much better than your silly friends...”</p><p class="double">“Why?” Chrysalis asked, as she reconnected the bridge.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re... clowns!” The three figures in the mist stepped forward, revealing ridiculously big shoes and red noses.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis actually giggled. She stopped after a second, mortified, and looked over her shoulder in case Trixie had heard.</p><p class="double">Hoping that Trixie had indeed missed her giggle, she turned back to the pegasus clowns. “By the way, I&#039;m an empath. My defences show my deepest wish as being to join the circus.”</p><p class="double">As that was being processed, she gave them all a quick psi-bolt each and they dissipated.</p><p class="double">“You actually giggled?” Trixie asked, trotting across the bridge to stand beside her.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blushed. “Oh, shut up.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie made a grand gesture. “Spike showed his Loyalty by growing to the size of a large whale! Chrysalis showed her Kindness by putting up with me! Zecora showed her Generosity by paying for the first round at the bar! Berry showed her Laughter by making up some really rather good puns for the names of her cocktails! And Gilda showed her honesty by beating up a Manticore!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon gaped. “Those are <i>not</i> virtuous acts.”</p><p class="double">Trixie shrugged. “I think you&#039;ll find everyone who knows me considers putting up with me for more than ten minutes to be an inherently virtuous act. Oh, by the way, the sixth element is Magic. Boom.”</p><p class="double">It was, perhaps, more desultory a speech than normal, but with six reasonably experienced Element users behind it it certainly worked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, anyway,” Twilight explained some minutes later to a rather startled Celestia, “I found some friends, and they dealt with Nightmare Moon. This is Trixie, the Element of Magic-”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “Your enormous exploding ball of plasma-ship.”</p><p class="double">“-ignore that, she&#039;s a little obsessed... this is Chrysalis, the Element of Kindness.”</p><p class="double">“Charmed.” Chrysalis fluttered her wings and smiled. “Queen of the Changelings.”</p><p class="double">“This is Gilda, Element of Honesty.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right,” Gilda confirmed. “Element of <i>brutal</i> honesty, here. And, to be brutally honest, heh, your plan here was kinda betting that you&#039;d be able to pull together an element team. Pre-tty risky.”</p><p class="double">“I did have a backup,” Celestia said, stung.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Gilda popped a lollipop into her mouth. “What was it?” she mumbled slightly.</p><p class="double">“Defeat my sister in one-on-one combat, so as to buy time for Twilight – who I hoped would be able to form the elements.” Celestia winced. “I must admit, it is not the best plan...”</p><p class="double">“This is Berry Punch. She&#039;s the Element of Laughter.” Twilight decided to try to smooth over the tricky situation.</p><p class="double">“I do alcohol and alcohol accessories,” Berry said, bobbing her head. “Mind if I look through the castle? I think there could be some alcohol in here that&#039;s been fermenting since Luna was co-regnal.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” Celestia replied.</p><p class="double">“You know Spike, of course,” Twilight continued. Celestia tried to say something about how she wasn&#039;t used to his being the size of a barn, but Twilight talked over her. “He&#039;s the Element of Loyalty. And this is Zecora. She&#039;s a zebra, and the Element of Generosity.”</p><p class="double">“I have generous discounts, though not offered out to viscounts.”</p><p class="double">The others glanced at her. The zebra replied by holding up a sign which had a long, fine-print diatribe about the difficulty of coming up with rhymes on the fly.</p><p class="double">“...very well, then,” Celestia concluded. “I can see Equestria is in... reasonably safe hooves. Now, I must invite you to the – belated – Summer Sun celebration, which shall also be the welcome return of my sister. Twilight, were the preparations completed?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight held up a large scroll. “Listed, checked and ticked.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“She&#039;s an evil enchantress!” Pinkie volunteered. “Or so they say. But why should evil be bad for business? Great discounts on potions, philters, magic and spells. On hexes and curses, on well-shielded purses, on prophecies, witches and tells!”</p><p class="double">“...what?” Applejack asked, blinking.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s on the business card, look.” Pinkie hoofed it over.</p><p class="double">“...huh. So it is.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, again!” Gilda bellowed. “Ten times around Ponyville in four minutes!”</p><p class="double">Dash panted. “Do I have to? I&#039;m exhausted, Gils!”</p><p class="double">“Dash,” Gilda replied, sternly. “I know you. You&#039;re awesome. But you&#039;ve also got a pretty lackadasical attitude to the whole issue of training. See, as I see it, the only pony who can win you that Young Fliers cup is you. And you&#039;re the only one who can <i>lose</i> it, as well. Do you want to live with yourself if you lose that cup because you didn&#039;t try hard enough?”</p><p class="double">“...guess not, no.” Dash spread her weary wings. “Okay, I&#039;ll give it a go.”</p><p class="double">“A go isn&#039;t enough, Dash.” Gilda walked closer. “You&#039;re the only pony to do a Sonic Rainboom in the last century and more. And you did it when you were, what, ten? Twelve? So you&#039;ve got the natural talent. Spitfire, Soarin&#039;, they&#039;re not as naturally fast as you. They&#039;re Wonderbolts because of how much effort they put in, and because they&#039;re confident. Really confident. They <i>know</i> what they can do. So <i>you</i> need to know what <i>you</i> can do. No second guessing because you&#039;re not sure you can push yourself as hard as you need to go. Just <i>push yourself</i>, and you&#039;ll find out how fast you were at the other end! Now git!”</p><p class="double">Dash rocketed off, leaving a trail of rainbow and puzzlement.</p><p class="double">Gilda nodded to herself. <i>That</i> should have given her a kick up the backside...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You&#039;re... you&#039;re... you&#039;re my best mate, you are!” Silver Star announced, exchanging his hat for the headdress of his Buffalo counterpart. “All&#039;a this... this... <i>stuff</i>, with the apples... it doesn&#039;t even matter! We&#039;ll put the apple trees on the <i>other</i> side of the village!”</p><p class="double">“How?” the Buffalo chief asked, then hiccuped.</p><p class="double">“Same way we planted &#039;em,” Silver Star declared, and fell over.</p><p class="double">“Anyone want another bottle of my Diplomatic Daiquiri?” Berry Punch offered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That&#039;s not really solving the problem,” Twilight said critically.</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Trixie asked, as the CMC held up placards with numbers on them. “Got rid of the dragon, didn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">“Along with a substantial fraction of the mountain, yes,” Twilight allowed. “But he&#039;s going to land somewhere, and he&#039;ll be really annoyed...”</p><p class="double">They both cast silence spells as the wall of overpressure from the explosion reached them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Where pony go?” Fido asked, confused.</p><p class="double">“Not sure,” a black-furred diamond dog replied. “I go check.”</p><p class="double">“Good,” Rover said.</p><p class="double">About a minute passed.</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Spot asked, raising a paw. “Who she?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis walked out of the Diamond Dog mine, and reverted to her base form. “Piece of cake.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike got the Hydra in a head-head-head-head-headlock, bashed all four heads against the ground, and throttled it until it went limp.</p><p class="double">“Okay, done!” he called, and the ponies of Ponyville gradually came out of hiding.</p><p class="double">“That was awesome!” Dash enthused.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Spike waved a paw and smiled. “I try.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(via Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, ladies, here we are,&quot; Spike deadpanned. &quot;It&#039;s the most famous party in Equestria, and it&#039;s probably going to be...

At the Gala!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been plotting, anticipating, this night with quite cunning mind,&quot; Chrysalis explained, flicking her silky dress. &quot;I&#039;ve got ponies to manipulate, though I&#039;ll stare at Trix&#039;s behind. Policy is going to change, cause I want equal rights for my kind! After all, the noble families are all here right now!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well one of them has the right idea at the very least... bribes and deals are often cut right here at the Grand Gala!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m here at the Grand Gala, where they serve the rarest wines,&quot; sang a mare in a lacy black dress, &quot;And every flavor there is will be tasted by Berry Pu-unch!

I can&#039;t go down to such a provincial town! And I was intoxicated when I signed the documents!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then you shouldn&#039;t have gotten so drunk at the gala,&quot; Celestia replied simply. &quot;Honestly, Blueblood, I think this will do you good. Zecora, take care of your new butler for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can promise I will treat him well for as long as he is under my spell.&quot; Zecora grinned, turning away. &quot;Now come along, Blueblood my dear, and be prepared to swallow your fear. We march to Everfree for herbs and leaves to make my potions on coming eves!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is all that purple mare&#039;s fault somehow...&quot; Blueblood grumbled. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, you&#039;re the Element of Honesty?” Discord asked, looking the griffin before him up and down.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Gilda nodded, baring her talons. “What&#039;s it to you?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” he snapped his claws together, materialized next to Gilda, and poked her in the forehead. “Time to-”</p><p class="double">There was a flash of green fire, and a changeling flopped to the floor.</p><p class="double">“Oh, come <i>on!</i>” Discord said forcefully. “That&#039;s the <i>fifth time!</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” asked four Trixies at once. “Which of us is real?”</p><p class="double">The draconequus looked around at the four sets of three ponies, one changeling, one griffin and one dragon each surrounding him.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I don&#039;t <i>know</i>,” he groused. “Give me a clue.”</p><p class="double">“The answer is,” one said, and then all four continued.</p><p class="double">“Trick question!”</p><p class="double">Rainbow light erupted from directly overhead.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, who wants to try to redeem him?” Gilda asked, as the statue was winched back into place.</p><p class="double">“I might try,” Berry offered. “Get him drunk enough?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>“Dear Twilight,” </i>Twilight read aloud.</p><p class="double"><i>“Please stop sending me friendship reports.

They&#039;re all female, at least for the sake of argument, and they are certainly all siblings.”</p><p class="double">Behind her, five hundred pairs of changelings waited uncertainly.</p><p class="double">“Now, remember,” Trixie was telling some of them, “When you start, all shout &#039;for the swarm!&#039; at once. It&#039;ll be hilarious.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, Dash,” Gilda said, lying back on the chair in her hospital room. “I get that you&#039;re bored. But have you tried reading something?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve never met a book I liked,” Dash replied, shaking her head. Then wincing, as that tugged on her wing.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ll like this one.” Gilda dropped a novel on her bedside table.</p><p class="double">Dash picked it up. “Who&#039;s Iris Drake?”</p><p class="double">Gilda grinned. “Oh, someone I met once. You&#039;ll like her style.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;m going to go on a quest to find out my true nature!” Spike announced.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t you already <i>know</i> your true nature?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Because other dragons aren&#039;t nice, I want to find out if I&#039;m really like other dragons,” he continued, as though she hadn&#039;t spoken. “Do not wait for me, fair Equestrians, for I know not how long I will be gone.”</p><p class="double">Spike spread his wings, then his whole body, grew to about fifty feet long, and launched off to where the dragons had gone.</p><p class="double">Five minutes later, he flew back over the horizon.</p><p class="double">“Weren&#039;t you looking for your true nature?” Trixie asked.</p><p class="double">“Meh, got bored.” Spike held up a paw, in which was a tiny baby phoenix. “I found this guy, though. He&#039;s so cute!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy squee&#039;d.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Just drink this,” Berry said. “It&#039;ll give you confidence.”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Fluttershy asked, wings flexing nervously as she contemplated what she&#039;d have to do.</p><p class="double">“Liquid courage. Also ginger, a bit of bahgol, and a Potion of Bull&#039;s Strength.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy took the mug, and gave a dubious sniff. “It smells potent.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s like medicine,” Berry mostly-explained. “Go on, it&#039;s great.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus took a sip, slowly and carefully.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, we got the water up to Cloudsdale,” Dash allowed. “Also Fluttershy broke the sound barrier.”</p><p class="double">Berry grinned uneasily. “Well... mission fulfilled?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This cake, the ZZZZ, is my greatest work, you see. It tastes for me like plum – but changes for your tongue.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie raised an eyebrow. “Really? &#039;cause that doesn&#039;t sound cake-ysically possible.”</p><p class="double">Zecora gave her a look. “And you presume to lecture me on what can be confectionery?”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough! Can I try some?”</p><p class="double">Zecora nodded.</p><p class="double">Pinkie picked up a spoon, took the tiniest portion of the cake onto the bowl of the spoon, and tasted it.</p><p class="double">Her eyes unfocused. “So... much... sugar...”</p><p class="double">THUMP.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that went well,” Shining said, apropos of nothing much, as he and his new wife entered their suite.</p><p class="double">“Why do you say that, Shiny?” Cadence asked. “I thought it was very well planned out, yes, but why mention it?”</p><p class="double">“...not sure, actually,” Shining admitted. “I just thought I&#039;d say it went well.”</p><p class="double">“Goof,” she informed him with a grin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Didn&#039;t you have an appointment somewhere today?” Trixie asked.</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Chrysalis replied. “Not at all.”</p><p class="double">“Okay. Just checking.” She yawned. “Hey, turn the heat up a notch, will you? This jacuzzi&#039;s feeling a bit cool.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And that,” Trixie said smugly, “is that.”</p><p class="double">The crystal ponies looked at her, and her entourage. They then looked at the moon, which had a scowling face on it.</p><p class="double">One of them raised a hoof. “Er... are any of you princesses?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m a queen,” Chrysalis volunteered.</p><p class="double">“Good enough. What&#039;s your name?”</p><p class="double">“Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">“All hail Empress Chrysalis of the Crystal Empire!”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">Seeing her in a state of bafflement, her five friends decided to capitalize on this, and took photos.</p><p class="double">“Wait, no,” she protested, once she&#039;d recovered. “I&#039;m already busy with one queendom. I can&#039;t rule your Empire as well-”</p><p class="double">The crystal ponies muttered amongst themselves. The general sentiment was that that was a dreadful shame, because it would have worked out quite well.</p><p class="double">“Help me out here, Trix!” Chrysalis hissed.</p><p class="double">Trixie pondered. “Do I have to? I like the idea of being empress consort-”</p><p class="double">“Trixie!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, fine.” Trixie turned. “Spike? Can you send a letter to Princess Cadence? I think we might have a job for her. It should stop Celestia from moaning about her lazing around the palace, too...”</p><p class="double">“Celestia doesn&#039;t moan about that,” Gilda commented.</p><p class="double">“She might.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hm.” Discord looked himself up and down, then left and right, forwards and backwards, and in and out for good measure. “I&#039;m less made-of-stone than I expected.”</p><p class="double">Berry Punch stepped forward, her Element glittering. “Hi, Discord. I have volunteered to try to redeem you.”</p><p class="double">Discord sniggered.</p><p class="double">“No, seriously. Look, it&#039;s this or we turn you back to stone and find some pigeons.”</p><p class="double">The draconequus stopped laughing. “You wouldn&#039;t dare.”</p><p class="double">“Actually, I think we would. Guys?”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “Yep.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s delightfully clever, isn&#039;t it?” Chrysalis mused.</p><p class="double">“I know a few such feathered friends</p><p>and what comes out of their-”</p><p class="double">“Ahem!” Spike coughed.</p><p class="double">Gilda shook her head. “I voted for hitting you with a sword until you got brain undamage. I was overruled.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Discord took a second look at the other Elements. “How would the rest of you try to redeem me?”</p><p class="double">“Explosions!” Trixie carolled.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shot her a tender look, then cleared her throat. “A careful plan of research to discover what you liked, using telempathy, and then giving you small but meaningful rewards whenever you made positive progress. Also an army.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d probably use the force,” Spike decided. “And Zecora would give you some medicine that was foul tasting and a metaphysical purgative.”</p><p class="double">“I cannot deny it. I would indeed try it.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Discord stroked his beard. “On balance, I&#039;m going home with the drunk.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Can you do... a fish?”</p><p class="double">Discord snapped his claws. A very thin line appeared, which rotated until it became clear it was a flounder.</p><p class="double">“Flatfish,” he explained, as it swam off through the air. As it moved away, the two dimensional fish thinned once more to near invisibility.</p><p class="double">Ruby Pinch clapped. “Yay! Now do a chicken!”</p><p class="double">A puff of smoke, and Scootaloo appeared in the kitchen.</p><p class="double">“What the-” she managed, before vanishing again.</p><p class="double">“Whoops,” Discord said, chuckling. “Let&#039;s try that again.”</p><p class="double">This time, a chicken the size of an apple appeared. It crowed a very high-pitched crow, and vanished leaving behind an egg.</p><p class="double">“I thought cockerels didn&#039;t lay eggs...” Ruby said slowly.</p><p class="double">“I was never one for biology,” Discord shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Well, you two are getting on well,” Berry observed, trotting into the room.</p><p class="double">“She amuses me,” Discord announced. “I&#039;m only doing it because I need a laugh.”</p><p class="double">“Well, laughter <i>is</i> kind of my thing,” Berry replied. “You know. The kind of laughter when something that&#039;s normally not the least bit amusing seems just hilarious, because you&#039;re about two percent the right side of sloshed. Or the kind of laughter that happens when friends relax together, too.”</p><p class="double">“What about the kind of maniacal laughter that happens when an evil scheme is fulfilled perfectly?” Discord asked. “That&#039;s my favourite kind.”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s a drink for that,” she replied with a grin. “Tell you what. After Ruby&#039;s gone to bed, I&#039;ll show you.”</p><p class="double">“Is it bedtime already?” Ruby asked, a slight hint of whine in her voice.</p><p class="double">“Of course not,” Discord replied, snapping his claws again. The sun shot back to the middle of the sky.</p><p class="double">Muffled cursing could be heard from Twilight&#039;s tree library, where Luna was staying while Discord was in Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“Put it <i>back</i>,” Berry said, with an indulgent smile.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” Discord asked, half an hour later once Ruby had gone to bed. “What was that you said about a drink?”</p><p class="double">Berry gave him a look. “If I was a suspicious pony, I&#039;d say you were playing so nicely with my daughter to make me try and forget that you&#039;re going to be trying to escape and go on a rampage.”</p><p class="double">Discord looked shifty.</p><p class="double">“But I&#039;m a simple town drunk, so what do I know.” Berry Punch shrugged, and opened a cupboard. Inside was a simple wooden keg.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s that?” Discord asked.</p><p class="double">“My greatest achievement to date.” Berry put the keg reverently on the table. “You&#039;ve heard of the Campaign for Real Ale?”</p><p class="double">“Only by stealing a newspaper while you weren&#039;t looking.”</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>this</i> is Real Ale. It is the platternic ideal of a drink brewed from barley,” she elaborated, referencing the great scholar On-a Platter and his theory that images of perfect things were just handed to you without having to do research.</p><p class="double">“Sounds interesting.” With a flash of chaos magic, a tumbler and a long bendy straw appeared. “What&#039;s the deal?”</p><p class="double">“Drinking contest. I pass out, you go free. You pass out, then you have to behave. Deal?”</p><p class="double">Discord shook on it. Then he stepped off it and shook her hoof. “Fine, then.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Berry&#039;s eyes cracked blearily open.</p><p class="double">There seemed to be an awful lot of scraggly hair in her face.</p><p class="double">“Mummy,” the voice of her daughter cut through her hangover, making her wince. “Is mister Discord my new daddy?”</p><p class="double">The words took a back-woods route into Berry&#039;s brain, resulting in a delay of nearly ten seconds between the question being asked and it reaching her consciousness.</p><p class="double">She took the question, added the beard in her face, multiplied by the fact she was entangled with something with four different kinds of limb she could feel, and reached a conclusion.</p><p class="double">“...sure, why not.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Didn&#039;t see that coming...” Spike observed. “He sincere?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, surprisingly,” Chrysalis supplied. “Who knew. Get Discord drunk enough, and look what happens...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Do I have to?&quot; Trixie whined. &quot;I hate paperwork...&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. &quot;Look, we all know that the spell was meant to go to the crown originally. We can&#039;t break character this late in the game.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike cleared his throat. &quot;And there&#039;s the fact that only two of us--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I would count three, including me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Zecora, three of us--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually,&quot; Berry mused, &quot;there was that one loop where Gilda was a griffon-alicorn hybrid.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda shivered. &quot;I still don&#039;t know how Sparkle pulled that off...&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike glowered. &quot;....Four of us--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And a changeling queen is kind of a changeling alicorn,&quot; Trixie pointed out.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t really see myself that way,&quot; Chrysalis mused. &quot;Not even in &#039;cursed changeling&#039; loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So we&#039;re all able to go alicornish,&quot; Berry pondered. &quot;Except Spike, unless you count Spikezilla.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And with that, there goes my point,&quot; the dragon grumbled. &quot;Anyway, we were trying to convince Trixie that she has to become a princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ruby Pinch!&quot; Berry shouted. &quot;I am not leaving my daughter for the throne. I&#039;m out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As much as I&#039;d like to help her, I&#039;ve got a similar excuse with the swarm.&quot; Chrysalis shrugged. &quot;I&#039;ll help with the paperwork though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me and Spike aren&#039;t ponies, so us transforming would be weird.&quot; Gilda grinned. &quot;Especially after Spike&#039;s already gone back and forth with Spikezilla.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie looked to Zecora helplessly. &quot;Racial equality? Maybe?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That spell requires a magic fount, which ponies have in no small amount. Alas, in this loop zebras rely on directing the power of earth and sky.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh, fine, I&#039;ll finish the spell.&quot; Trixie picked up the book. &quot;...actually, what would happen if I cast the incomplete version?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her fellow bearers dogpiled on her instantly. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thank you, Princess.” Twilight took the stand to make a speech. “I think I speak for all of Ponyville, and much of Canterlot, when I describe the ascension of our newest Princess as... almost inevitable.”</p><p class="double">Mass confusion greeted that opening line.</p><p class="double">“Trixie Lulamoon is many things,” Twilight continued. “She&#039;s smart, powerful, and has a worrying lack of regard for her own personal safety. But she&#039;s got a certain strong sense of responsibility towards everypony – and everyone – else. When was the last time she hurt anyone, even in her blasts the size of a small city?”</p><p class="double">Silence.</p><p class="double">“Exactly. But she doesn&#039;t give a fig about making sure <i>she&#039;s</i> out of the blast zone. As such, within a few days of meeting her, I decided she was either going to become immune to explosions-”</p><p class="double">“<i>Resistant</i>,” Trixie interrupted.</p><p class="double">“Resistant, thank you... or she was going to be scattered in ten thousand tiny pieces all over Equestria by the time she was twenty-five.”</p><p class="double">After thinking that over, the crowd decided Twilight had had a point.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis took the podium next, and proceeded to embarrass her marefriend so thoroughly that her cheeks looked like she was wearing the alicorn amulet.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, let us take stock,” Trixie said quietly. “I&#039;ve run out of explosives.”</p><p class="double">Even after everything they&#039;d been through with her, eyes widened on both other ponies, as well as the changeling, the dragon and the griffin.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s... never happened to me before,” she added in tones of slight wonderment. Then shook her head. “Anyway. I think we&#039;re all fairly beaten up.”</p><p class="double">Nods.</p><p class="double">“And we&#039;ve had to surrender our Elements to the thing, to boot.” Trixie winced. “I still hate doing that, it makes me feel tired for the whole rest of the loop...”</p><p class="double">“What now?” Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">“Now...” Trixie considered. “Now, I think, we recover. Get our hooves, or other appropriate appendages, under us. And start manufacturing gunpowder.”</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Berry raised a hoof. “Why gunpowder?”</p><p class="double">“The grinding motions soothe me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Excuse me?”</p><p class="double">Spike looked up from roasting a sprig. (He liked the taste of charcoalized wood, it was never the same twice.) “Yes...” he paused, snapping his fingers. “Rarity... Belle, right? One of Twilight&#039;s friends.”</p><p class="double">It hurt, to be distant. Especially after last time – an Arda loop, tens of thousands of years long, and one without his wife. At times, he wanted to be with her so much it hurt.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that&#039;s right,” Rarity replied.</p><p class="double">But he could do it. He had experience at this.</p><p class="double">“So, what brings you to the library? Shall I go and get Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“No!” Rarity said, quickly.</p><p class="double">“...okay, then.” Spike mentally shrugged. “What is it, then? Want help with your business?”</p><p class="double">“I...” Rarity slowed, and clenched her teeth for a moment. “Y... yes. Yes, I&#039;ve got some heavy lifting to do, I&#039;m afraid, and my own magic is rather better at detail work. Could I prevail upon your time, Mister Spykoran?”</p><p class="double">Spike noticed the flash of... self-loathing? That ran across her face for a second, but wasn&#039;t entirely sure what to make of it.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” he replied. “Hang on a sec, I&#039;ll write Twilight a note.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, there you go,” the dragon said with a grunt of effort, drake-handling the last crate of material into the boutique. “Anywhere in particular you want this?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, just... put it in the back, -Spike,” she instructed, nearly tripping over a syllable before she said his name. “I shaln&#039;t need it moved so long as the top is visible – my magic is quite up to opening a crate.”</p><p class="double">Spike dutifully put the crate down as instructed. “Okay, done.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you very much,” Rarity said. “Now... I think we&#039;re done.”</p><p class="double">Her voice carried a tone of regret, and a suspicion began to grow in Spike&#039;s thoughts.</p><p class="double">“Spykoran...” she said, hesitantly. “I... would you like some tea?”</p><p class="double">Once again, that brief expression of disgust at herself.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Spike agreed. “Tea would be nice. I&#039;ll take five sugars and some damaged needles.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thanks for the drink,” Spike said, smiling.</p><p class="double">“And thank you for your help,” Rarity returned. “I...”</p><p class="double">She frowned briefly, then took a quick step forward and kissed him.</p><p class="double">Startled, Spike reacted on instinct. He leaned into it, as <i>his wife</i> embraced him after so long apart-</p><p class="double">Then he blinked, and shook himself out of her grasp. “Rarity-”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry,” Rarity said, a blush flaring on her cheeks. “I... well, it&#039;s done now. I originally went to the library to ask you – not for help, but...”</p><p class="double">The blush intensified.</p><p class="double">“I wanted to ask you on a date. I was a coward, and I couldn&#039;t say it, but... I have now.”</p><p class="double">Spike took a moment to process that. Then a moment more to try to work out how to respond.</p><p class="double"><i>How the hay do I react to that!?</p><p class="double"></i>“Rarity,” Spike began, “can you give me a moment?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The problem facing Spike, right now, could be summed up simply.</p><p class="double">What do you do when an alternate version of your wife reveals she has a crush on you and would like to go on a date with you?</p><p class="double">Supplemental to that were further questions, like <i>can you cheat on your wife with herself</i>, <i>can you lead someone who isn&#039;t awake on romantically</i> and <i>what do I even want?</p><p class="double"></i>“Cress, cress, cress,” he muttered to himself, pacing in small circles. “What do I do?”</p><p class="double">“I could tell her that I&#039;ve got a significant other already... but she&#039;d want to know who this significant other is, and lying about it would make me feel... dirty.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe if I say I&#039;m not interested?” He sighed. “But... I <i>am</i>, that&#039;s half the problem. And it&#039;d be a terrible let down for her.”</p><p class="double">“If I just go along with it?” Spike grimaced. “Arguably worse. <i>Is</i> she my wife? Would it be being... well, disloyal... if I did go out with her? If I got romantically involved? And if she <i>does</i> count as my wife, would it be disloyal <i>not</i> to?”</p><p class="double">The dragon, jedi master, and Element of Loyalty... felt a headache coming on.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay.” Spike came back out of the kitchen, and sat on one of the chairs.</p><p class="double">“This is going to sound crazy. But I can prove it, I swear.”</p><p class="double">“Go on,” Rarity invited.</p><p class="double">“Right. Well... I&#039;m basically a time traveller. I&#039;ve been caught in a time loop, along with some others, for... Tartarus, I&#039;ve lost count.”</p><p class="double">“Are the other elements-”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Spike nodded. “That&#039;s very quick of you. Yes, the Elements this time are all time loopers, like me.”</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked. <i>“This</i> time?”</p><p class="double">“Yes. The normal – the default – element bearers are Twilight, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack... and you.”</p><p class="double">“I was... an Element?” Rarity turned that over in her mind. “Which one?”</p><p class="double">“Generosity. Funny thing, the first time &#039;round, I wasn&#039;t able to do... this,” he gestured at his body. “So I was a baby dragon. And I had a crush on <i>you</i>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Spike&#039;s lips quirked up in a smile. “Funny how things work, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">Rarity didn&#039;t reply.</p><p class="double">“And... well, you&#039;re looping as well. And we eventually did fall in love, mutually, and... we married. So I&#039;m married... but it&#039;s basically to <i>you</i>, or your... older? To your older self, and I&#039;ve got <i>no idea</i> how to react to all this.” Spike&#039;s paw went to rub his forehead. “This is giving me a headache.”</p><p class="double">“Not surprised,” Rarity managed to joke. “It&#039;s giving me one as well.”</p><p class="double">Spike chuckled.</p><p class="double">“So, there it is,” he said, after the silence stretched. “I don&#039;t know what to do, frankly, and sorry for throwing it all onto you. But-”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I see.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn frowned. “So... we&#039;re married?”</p><p class="double">“Yes. Sort of. It&#039;s complicated.” Spike threw up his hands. “I haven&#039;t memorized the words Twilight came up with for this kind of situation – she calls it the future unpossible tense or something – but...”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. “Quite.”</p><p class="double">She took a few long, deep breaths, and then walked over to her dresser. Something glittered for a moment as she picked it up, and trotted back over with it.</p><p class="double">“Here,” she said, offering it. “It&#039;s a diamond I found back when I started seriously thinking about asking you out. I was going to give it to you as a present at the end of the evening – which was a little silly of me, I suppose...”</p><p class="double">“No, I like the idea,” Spike assured her. “A nice romantic gesture. You know, back the first time around, I gave you a fire ruby that I&#039;d planned to eat for my birthday?” He smiled, thinking back over untold numbers of loops. “You wore it a lot after that. It made me hopeful.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a nice story.” Rarity held the gem out. “Here. You may as well take it, then.”</p><p class="double">“Rarity-”</p><p class="double">“Really. I insist.” She smiled, wanly. “Call it... a birthday present.”</p><p class="double">Spike took it, admiring how it refracted the sunlight. “Thanks. And thanks for taking this so well.”</p><p class="double">“Not at all.” Rarity managed a giggle this time. “If I <i>have</i> to lose, at least I can lose to myself.”</p><p class="double">A grin broke out on Spike&#039;s face. Then he tentatively raised a claw. “Actually... I was wondering. Would I be able to treat you to dinner at some point?”</p><p class="double">He gave an apologetic shrug. “I know it&#039;s not much... but if you <i>do</i> enjoy spending time with me, then I&#039;ve got time to spend. And since you know...”</p><p class="double">“Thank you. I believe I will take you up on that offer.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why... isn&#039;t this... working,” Trixie panted, horn still crackling.</p><p class="double">Tirek chuckled. “You really should pay attention, &#039;Princess&#039;. I took the magic of the Captain of the Guard, and so I can shield myself from those explosive devices of yours. And as for the <i>magical</i> ones... well, I drain magic. You use magic. Simple, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">Trixie ground her teeth. “Chryssy?”</p><p class="double">The changeling stepped up next to her. “Yes?”</p><p class="double">“Mind recharging me, love?”</p><p class="double">“Not at all.” Chrysalis leaned in and touched horns with Trixie. A faint blue-green shimmer built around the point of contact, and slowly brightened.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s as much as I&#039;ve got left,” Chrysalis said, after nearly two full minutes. “Don&#039;t waste it.”</p><p class="double">“Never,” Trixie replied, then turned back to Tirek. Her Device, Loki, burst into being on her foreleg. “Okay, let&#039;s try this again.”</p><p class="double">“I look forward to it,” Tirek invited, smiling the smile of the certain.</p><p class="double">“You know he&#039;s basically invulnerable to your usual thing, right?” Chrysalis whispered.</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Trixie&#039;s grin was not a nice one. “So I&#039;m not doing the usual thing.”</p><p class="double">Her wings flared, and she shot upwards.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Moment of Prescience. Foresight. Choose Destiny. Know Vulnerabilities. Assay Spell Resistance.”</p><p class="double">High over Ponyville, Trixie cast spells as fast as they could flow through her horn.</p><p class="double">When explosions failed, Trixie could – reluctantly – face that a change of approach was needed. Specifically, rather than learn everything by doing and guesswork with a side order of risk, she was... doing the research.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s good to know...” she murmured, as a growing web of divination spells analyzed Tirek&#039;s defences. “Lots of antimagic, but I knew that already. Hm, active defences? Ah, a shield – looks like one of Shining&#039;s, so he was telling the truth...”</p><p class="double">Unfortunately, there was only so much that divinations could tell her. What it came down to was, she was essentially armed with an extremely well-made spear, and her opponent was armoured like a battleship.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Trixie sighed, coming down to land. “I&#039;m out of ideas. Whatever else I pull off is just going to make this take longer. Go ahead, take all I&#039;ve got left.”</p><p class="double">The others gasped.</p><p class="double">“Trixie-”</p><p class="double">“Shut up!” she shouted, tears starting in her eyes. “I don&#039;t know what to do, okay!? I... can&#039;t think of anything. And I...”</p><p class="double">She slumped. “I&#039;m <i>tired</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Well, this does simplify things.” Tirek reached out, and gripped her wingtip.</p><p class="double">Trixie almost instantly tinged slightly gray, and her cutie mark faded.</p><p class="double">Tirek blinked. “Not as much as I&#039;d have expected, from an alicorn princess...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, yeah.” Trixie looked up. “That&#039;d be because I specified all I had <i>left</i>.” A shrug. “That&#039;d be, about enough to light a candle and make sparkly lights.”</p><p class="double">She gestured back over her shoulder. “Now, <i>him</i>, on the other hand-”</p><p class="double">Scorpan hit his brother like a meteorite.</p><p class="double">“Fun thing,” Trixie said, smiling brightly. “It&#039;s not just you who can absorb magic.”</p><p class="double">She turned, and something fell out of her hat.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s that?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that?” Trixie picked it up in a hoof. “Scorpan insisted on paying for all the magic I gave him. It&#039;s a medallion – he seemed to think it was important, and, well...”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s great!” Twilight smiled. “You&#039;ve got the last key.”</p><p class="double">The current Element bearers exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Key?” Spike asked, for all of them.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Twilight ducked, as some debris flew over her head from the centaur fight. “The first time I faced Tirek, it turned out that we&#039;d each earned a key relating to our element. They&#039;re objects which glitter like rainbows when we get them, and they&#039;re used to-”</p><p class="double">She broke off, staring into the distance. The others followed her gaze, and saw that Tirek was now using an entire tree as a club to beat Scorpan over the head with.</p><p class="double">“Oh, oak and ash, not again...”</p><p class="double">Berry squinted. “Isn&#039;t that...”</p><p class="double">“<i>Yes.</i>” Twilight&#039;s eye twitched. “<i>Every</i> time...”</p><p class="double">“Wait, when you said keys,” Spike asked slowly, reaching into his Pocket. “You mean like this?”</p><p class="double">A small clear diamond emerged.</p><p class="double">Twilight ignored her (now on fire) house with an act of will, and focused on the diamond.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that feels like one. Where&#039;d you get it from?”</p><p class="double">“Rarity, actually – this Rarity, I mean.” Spike rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand. “It was all a bit embarrassing...”</p><p class="double">“What about this?” Gilda held out a shimmering gold pin. “Lightning Dust gave it to me after I helped her out.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Honesty, right enough.”</p><p class="double">The other three brought out their tokens, one by one. A mirror-bright cloak clasp for Chrysalis; three rings on a cord for Zecora; and a small pearl for Berry.</p><p class="double">“Okay, now – you know that box? The one from the Tree of Harmony?”</p><p class="double">An embarrassed silence spread.</p><p class="double">“...you never picked up the box, did you. Right, hold on a sec.” Twilight flashed out of existence.</p><p class="double">“So these shine like rainbows?” Berry asked, holding her pearl up to the light. “Seems to be doing that all the time.”</p><p class="double">“Same with mine,” Trixie volunteered, tilting it. “It&#039;s kind of like a CD – you know, the diffraction gratings formed by the pits...”</p><p class="double">Twilight materialized again. “Okay, found it. Now, hold them out to the box, and they&#039;ll turn into keys, and-”</p><p class="double">She stopped, and giggled. “Well, I don&#039;t want to spoil the surprise...”</p><p class="double">“Because <i>that&#039;s</i> not ominous,” Trixie commented. “Okay, guys. One, two, three!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Some time later, Twilight walked into the crystalline mountain that had replaced much of a field outside Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“I have to say, I like the aesthetic,” she commented. “Kind of a mix of underground base and lair. Hi, Zecora!”</p><p class="double">The zebra just gave her a look, the complicated spiral swirls all over her body only adding to the effect. “I look and feel like modern art. Could you not have warned of this part?”</p><p class="double">“I wanted it to be a surprise,” Twilight defended. “Besides, it&#039;s something <i>new</i>. Something baseline, and new, and great fun. How rare is <i>that?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Right. Quite.”</p><p class="double">Twilight trotted briskly on, passing Berry Punch (who had something of a vine theme) and Gilda with every feather and hair half as long again as normal. (It actually looked rather rakish.)</p><p class="double">Then she reached the main room.</p><p class="double">“I look... ridiculous,” Chrysalis was saying, looking herself up and down. “I mean, come <i>on.</i>”</p><p class="double">“I like it,” Trixie replied, inspecting her own starry fetlocks and wild hair. “Especially the bigger wings, they look good on you.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re only saying that because you think <i>everything</i> looks good on me,” Chrysalis retorted. “You&#039;re right, though.”</p><p class="double">Spike waved as Twilight came into view. “Hi, Twi. That was... different.”</p><p class="double">“Imagine how I felt.” The unicorn tilted her head. “Are your claws...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, still smouldering.” Spike shrugged, his wings shifting and releasing a crackle of purple smoke. “At least I&#039;m not actually on fire, though.”</p><p class="double">“There is that.” Twilight turned in place, gazing around at the mountain. “You know, I wonder to what extent the Element users involved can change what the end product looks like...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">95.3</p><p class="double">“Right, let&#039;s see...”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked down at where the book had been. Then blinked.</p><p class="double">“Okay, where&#039;d that go?”</p><p class="double">Muffled giggling came from a nearby tree.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “Pinkie.”</p><p class="double">The pink party pony poked her head out of the tree, showing a beak had been taped to her face. Then she spread black-painted wings. “I&#039;m a mag-pie!”</p><p class="double">Twilight stifled a grin. “Oh, that&#039;s terrible. Are you a pegasus this time?”</p><p class="double">“Yuperoonie!” Pinkie beamed. “Dashie&#039;s an earth pony this time. She&#039;s not awake, though, so boo.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">95.4</p><p class="double"><i>To whom it may concern,</p><p class="double">Activities in this loop are considered to be restricted.

Her own kamui pulsed, then reshaped itself.</p><p class="double">“...okay, I didn&#039;t even know you could make pony clothing <i>do</i> that,” Ryuko said. “Seriously. That looks... well, good on you. But we might be arrested.”</p><p class="double"><i>“I thought it through.”</p><p class="double"></i>With that, Satsuki&#039;s outfit went quiescent again.</p><p class="double">“He never says much,” Satsuki said briskly. “Right, what now?”</p><p class="double">“...hell if I know.” Ryuko pointed, flaring her wings. “Look, a clothes shop. Might be where that... Rarity? Works?”</p><p class="double">“Worth a try.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">95.5</p><p class="double">“I see you&#039;ve taken another step up the ladder,” Twilight called up.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t you mean the stairs?” Pinkie replied, grinning over the ship&#039;s rail. “We&#039;re ponies, you silly filly!”</p><p class="double">“I blame too much time around humans. Request permission to come aboard?”</p><p class="double">A fruit bounced down next to her. “Persimmon granted!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, so... what is it?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a baffleship!” Pinkie hit a switch, and the whole enormous construct turned transparent. “Bringing stealth parties to one and all, that&#039;s the PTAS <i>Enjoyable</i> way!”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, rapping the deck with a hoof. “Steel?”</p><p class="double">“Armoured steel, yup! I don&#039;t want the magazines to catch fire, &#039;cause I haven&#039;t read them all yet.”</p><p class="double">“And a cloaking device... okay, I&#039;ve put it off long enough. What kind of party projection capacity does this have?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie hit the same button, and the ship returned to opacity. “Well, there&#039;s two triple turrets at the front – they&#039;ve got ribbons on, because it&#039;s the bow, hee hee. And there&#039;s another triple turret at the back – I drew a snarly face on it, because-”</p><p class="double">“Because stern, yes.” Twilight nodded. “I see. And what do the guns fire?”</p><p class="double">“Same kind of large party munition as I normally use.” Pinkie shrugged. “If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it. No, the <i>real</i> cool thing is this! Watch!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie went below. When Twilight turned to follow, the door slammed shut.</p><p class="double">“...okay...”</p><p class="double">The engines thrummed from standby to full power. Twilight peered over the edge, watching the water churned by the four huge screws.</p><p class="double">Then began to realize just <i>what</i> Pinkie had done.</p><p class="double">As she watched, the rushing, churning sound of the prop wash died away, replaced by a smooth whine as the screws bit into air.</p><p class="double">And, heeling slightly with the wind, PTAS <i>Enjoyable</i> rose majestically into the sky.</p><p class="double">“Like it?” Pinkie asked, now wearing a jaunty hat. “Where you had to go to the old parties, the new parties will come to you!”</p><p class="double">She looked down. “Plus, I built it in a lake again, so this helps. Now, set course for Cloudsdale! It&#039;s Dashie&#039;s birthday, and I want to make sure there&#039;s cake!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">95.6 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had been busy lately. Her studies into the power of the arcane magic of the multiverse had at long last reached the point that she could call them &#039;good enough, for now anyway&#039;. And what was she doing to celebrate? Resuming her studies of the spiritual magic of the multiverse, naturally!</p><p class="double">Last night, she had been amazed to discover the similarities between zebra and buffalo mystics, and had joyfully gone on a study binge as she constructed her own sets of totems and ritualistic equipment from both cultures to compare them, using some handy beginner&#039;s level &#039;do it yourself&#039; books. (Written by the famed author team of Globe Trotter and Artsy Crafts.)</p><p class="double">Twilight had slept with a smile. She always felt great when she had a project to look foreward to when she woke up.</p><p class="double">So it understandably took her a moment to notice the pony above her bed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, friend Twilight! Thou art awake! We are most elated!&quot; an unawake Luna beamed down at her, despite her struggling. &quot;Some foul prankster hast snuck into thy dwelling and placed ancient traps most annoying inside. If thou would help us down, we would be most thankful for ending our embarrassment!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight could only blink owlishly for a moment, before having to fight back a case of the giggles. &quot;Of-(snerk!) Of course, P-princess Luna. One moment.&quot; She grinned as she slid out of bed.</p><p class="double">Luna nodded in appreciation and royal dignity, which in all honesty only made her sprawling limbs trapped in the assorted homemade dreamcatchers in Twilight&#039;s bedroom look all the more ridiculous to the highly amused unicorn. &quot;Much thanks. We have needed to scratch our nose for hours!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">95.7 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">The Equestrian Loopers that had been found thus far floated inside the wrecked submarine the Apples had been using as a base before Awakening. None of them had been able to get out-loop abilities or objects to work either, although the forms they&#039;d looped into opened... Possibilities. Applejack was larger than her brother for once, having looped into a Great White to Macintosh&#039;s hammerhead. Applebloom was trying to manipulate a wrench, alternating between her snaggled Mako teeth and inflexible fins. Not much success to be had.</p><p class="double">“Aww, come on! First time ah get a chance to tinker with a gen-u-wine U-boat, aged perfectly at the bottom of an ocean, an&#039; ah wind up with no good limbs an&#039; a mouth fulla toothpicks.”</p><p class="double">The older Apples were being more social, helping Twilight plan Operation: Recover Nyx. There were some kinks to work out, they didn&#039;t have access to nearly enough fruitcake, and more importantly none of them knew where to find the filly-turned-guppy. Macintosh had a green scuba mask draped over one side of his “hammer”, and it swung back and forth as he spoke.</p><p class="double">“Ain&#039;t nothin&#039; sayin&#039; this mask here belongs to yer fillynapper, but if&#039;n there&#039;s P. Shermans from Sydney droppin&#039; divin&#039; equipment in this neck of th&#039; ocean...”</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded.</p><p class="double">“Yep, makes sense Australia&#039;d be th&#039; place to start lookin&#039;.”</p><p class="double">Discussion continued, mostly about how to arrive at Australia from their current location, until Applejack had a thought and decided to share. </p><p class="double">“Ah must admit, ah&#039;m relieved tha Loops went an&#039; squandered th&#039; opportunity to make me ah seapony.”</p><p class="double">Never one to miss a good setup, Murphy chose that particular moment to have Pinkie bump her snout on a pipe. Only a sliver of blood escaped, but like a fateful waft of smoke, the crimson whisp found its way up Applejack&#039;s olfactory pores, causing her pupils to grow until they seemed to occupy the entire eye.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooh, ah&#039;ll be honest, that smells gooooooooooooooooooooood.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh and Applebloom looked at each other. They apparently knew what that meant, crying out in unison.</p><p class="double">&quot;Intahvention!&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh rammed Applejack, tumbling her to the side while Applebloom hustled Twilight and Pinkie through a hatchway, closing it with a flick of her tail just as Applejack broke away from her brother.</p><p class="double">Safe on the other side of the rusting, but still solid barrier, the elements of Magic and Laughter winced in time to the metalllic thuds, while Applebloom explained the situation between impacts.</p><p class="double">“Sorry Twai,”</p><p class="double">*bang *</p><p class="double">“loop memories.”</p><p class="double">*bang *</p><p class="double">“Th&#039; blood has,”</p><p class="double">*bang *</p><p class="double">“berserker effect!”</p><p class="double">*bang *</p><p class="double">“Y&#039;all better move along.”</p><p class="double">*bang *</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ll catch up to ya,”</p><p class="double">*bang *</p><p class="double">“when she snaps out of it!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">95.8 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, in this Equestria, everypony has a finite number of bucks they can give about things during their lifetimes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s AWFUL!

<p>96.1 (Kalimaru)</p><p class="double">With a flash as her powers came back under control, Twilight looked around the room she found herself in. She was standing in front of a chalkboard, there was a hole in the roof, and various plants around the room were turning back into ponies. Walking over to an infantile Spike, Twilight tapped her chin. &#039;<i>The application exam room? Then that means...&#039; </i></p><p class="double">Stepping into the room, Celestia walked over and examined Twilight. Leaning in close, Celestia put on a smile. &quot;Are you Awake, little one?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nodding, Twilight turned from Spike and walked over to her parents with Celestia next to her, whispering in Twilight&#039;s ear. &quot;Good, because it seems your family is a few years behind this Loop, and Nightmare Moon&#039;s coming back within the next year.&quot; Standing tall, Celestia turned to Twilight&#039;s parents. &quot;Would it be alright with you two if I were to take Twilight as my personal pupil? She has shown much potential, and I believe I can help her.&quot; Twilight&#039;s parents, recently potted plants, looked to their daughter. Seeing their hesitation, Twilight put on the puppy dog eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pwease?&quot;</p><p class="double">The results were immediate. Both of Twilight&#039;s parents visibly slackened and nodded. In the background, the panel of judges all gripped for their hearts and dropped like flies. Medic ponies had to come in and drag them out. As the door shut behind the comatose committee and their copious caretakers, Celestia turned to Twilight. &quot;Of course, that means you&#039;ll be accompanying me to Ponyville, come the Summer Sun Celebration this year.&quot; Looking over her shoulder, Celestia levitated Spike over. &quot;We&#039;ll be bringing our young friend along, of course.&quot; Placing Spike next to Twilight, Celestia watched as the dragonling hugged Twilight. Then she and both of Twilight&#039;s parents dropped.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Several months later, Celestia&#039;s personal chariot touched down outside of the town. Hopping down from it, Twilight had Spike on her back. She turned as Celestia began talking to her. &quot;I&#039;m sure I can leave the preparations to you, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Pwincess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hnnng!&quot; Celestia promptly fell from the chariot in a rather undignified mess. Gaining her hoofing again, she waved the chariot stallions back to Canterlot for more insulin shots. &quot;Good! Very good. I&#039;ll, um, I&#039;ll go tell the mayor I&#039;m here then. Right.&quot; Flapping her wings, Celestia took off for the town center. Out of habit, she looked back.</p><p class="double">Sitting there, waving a small hoof and smiling, was Twilight. Next to her, Spike was sucking his thumb and waving his free claw in an attempt to imitate her.</p><p class="double">Celestia promptly fell from the sky.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hewwo!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped before belting for the doctor&#039;s office. &quot;No, I don&#039;t need it for me. I&#039;m just telling you to keep a whole barrel of the stuff for everypony else!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there, little filly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hewwo, Appojack!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hnnng!&quot; And the whole of the Apple family reunion was halted for a trip to the doctor&#039;s office.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hewwo, Wainbow Dash!&quot;</p><p class="double">Nopony would say that Rainbow Dash aimed for that mud to avoid that filly. None were still standing when it happened.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hewwo, Waiwity!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my goodness! I must get you something to wear!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hewwo, Fwuttashy! Wook at this dwess Waiwity gave me!&quot;</p><p class="double">The butter pegasus turned, gave Twilght the once over, saw the matching outfit Spike was wearing, and squinted menacingly at the little filly. &quot;You win this round, Sparkle. Hurk!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">By the time Nightmare Moon took the stage, the town was comatose save three beings. Looking down on them, Nightmare Moon grimaced. &quot;So this was my sister&#039;s plan? A mare, a filly, and a dragonling? Foalish!&quot; Dropping down to the ground, the lunar diarch snorted and gave them each closer inspection. Finding nothing remarkable about the mare, Nightmare Moon disregarded her and turned to the youngsters.</p><p class="double">The filly was wearing a loose, light blue shirt and yellow rubber hat. Both were too big for the tiny filly, the shirt becoming a dress and the hat only stopped from engulfing the filly&#039;s head thanks to her small horn. The dragonling wore a matching ensemble, but his hat was small enough to fit properly. Then the two of them raised their arms/forehooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Woona!&quot;</p><p class="double">The Nightmare, an undefinable creature of hate and woe, died that day. It found its heart and promptly died from said heart exploding. And so, it left Woona and became no more. Sitting up and looking at the giggling filly and dragonling that were crawling over to her, Woona laughed and joined in the baby-babbling.</p><p class="double">Standing off to the side, Pinkie tapped a hoof against her chest. &quot;I am so glad my blood got replaced by insulin instead of syrup this Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.2 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight finished off her victory drink. &quot;Okay, new round! What&#039;s the weirdest song you&#039;ve ever turned into a heartsong?&quot; </p><p class="double">Sweetie grinned. &quot;You Are A Pirate.&quot; </p><p class="double">Vinyl smirked. &quot;I can beat that. Chicken Dance!&quot; </p><p class="double">Apple Bloom leaned back in her chair looking smug. &quot;Kid&#039;s stuff. Let&#039;s see you top I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;One Eyed One Horned Flying Purple People Eater.&quot; Spike chuckled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ouch, I concede.&quot; Apple Bloom relented.</p><p class="double">Berry shrugged. &quot;Beer.&quot; </p><p class="double">Celestia smiled sadly. &quot;I don&#039;t use them often, so it&#039;s not really weird, but... I once did Love You For A Thousand Years.&quot;</p><p class="double">Many &#039;Aww&#039;s were had as Luna blushed.</p><p class="double">Ditzy bounced in her seat. &quot;I did one in a Who loop! I was trying to get The Doctor and The Master to be friends again, and used I Hear Your Heart Beat To The Beat Of The Drums.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did it work?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorta. I got The Master to start a band, and he mellowed out a bit, so I&#039;m calling it a net gain.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Drums?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lead singer actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining thought for a moment as they got back on track. &quot;Surfing Bird.&quot; </p><p class="double">Fluttershy sighed. &quot;Oh dear. I was going to say Rock Lobster, but that has me beat.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Not Wearing Underwear Today.&quot; </p><p class="double">Everyone slowly turned to look at Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;... What?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Derpy, why are you flying backwards?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what they say, Twilight, Hindsight is twenty-twenty!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I&#039;d forgotten about that particular talent of yours...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess, I... I have a question.&quot; Twilight slunk into the bedroom. &quot;Actually it&#039;s more of an ethical dilemma...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled down at her faithful student, keeping her inward cursing to a minimum. &quot;Twilight, you know I would love to take time discussing things with you, but--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna&#039;s not Nightmare Moon anymore, and also I&#039;m in a time loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The royal diarch and raiser of the sun froze. &quot;A.... time loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight flinched. &quot;Sorry, you need context for this... Okay, a while back the multiverse was broken, and the people in charge put Equestria--and a whole bunch of other worlds--into time loops to fix it. Are you with me so far?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I... suppose...&quot; Celestia was mentally rearranging her plans as rapidly as she could. &quot;I take it you know about the Elements of Harmony then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes actually.&quot; With a flash, a tiara appeared on Twilight&#039;s head. &quot;Us bearers can summon ours at will... I&#039;m not overwhelming you am I?&quot; she added quickly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not too much, as of yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s good.... anyway. So the people in charge of repairing the multiverse... see, our loop used to last about five years. Recently – let&#039;s just call it recently – they managed to fix something up and... well, every once and a while we get a new week before the loop ends.&quot; She took a deep breath and let it out. &quot;And this last expansion... Tirek escaped.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked. &quot;You know about – no, of course you know about Tirek.&quot; Once more her mind set to reorganizing her plans. &quot;I assume this dilemma of yours has to do with that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. He went on a rampage and... personally, well, he took my friend&#039;s magic. My magic. Blew up my library too... We beat him in the end, of course, and I can take steps to stop him escaping.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ah. &quot;But... part of you wants vengeance.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes!&quot; Twilight shouted. &quot;That&#039;s it exactly! Except he&#039;s not the big strong Tirek I fought now. I mean, I could just step aside and let him become that monster before knocking him off his pedestal--or letting one of the other loopers do it! There are fillies in these loops that could take him one two! But, but to do that I&#039;d have to let nonlooping equestrians suffer, and....&quot; She sighed, lowering her head. &quot;Is it wrong, princess, to want vengeance? Even if I deny that urge... is it wrong to want?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Twilight. If I understand this situation correctly... you are far older than I am. In all the ways that really matter. And you&#039;re not alone in these loops, so why haven&#039;t you talked to your companions about this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have. It&#039;s just... they&#039;re all friends,&quot; Twilight said softly. &quot;Even my Celestia is a friend. And as much as I love them all.. I think I need a mentor more right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia sighed. &quot;I see. Well...&quot; She considered her words carefully. &quot;Vengeance is often rooted in anger, an eye for an eye. Vengeance rooted in hate, of course, you must avoid, but anger.... Anger makes one a lightning bolt, speeding you up and giving you power, but blindingly bright and hard to direct. To want is not wrong, but to let want consume you... it sounds very much as though you fear your anger will turn you into a monster.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...a little bit, yeah.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;I guess.... I guess I just needed to vent, is all. A lot. I mean... in the baseline, even Discord is reformed. Tirek... I don&#039;t know. Anyway, listen, Luna&#039;s Awake this loop, so just... be ready for things to go off script, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I will. Thank you for the heads up, and Twilight?&quot; Celestia smiled. &quot;I know, no matter what else, you are a good pony. I know this because you have the courage to do what you think is right and the humility to ask what is right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...thanks.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.5 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double">&quot;...What you call friendship, I call chains,&quot; Tirek rasped to the draconequus. &quot;You have been <i>tamed</i>, Discord.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Tirek, you old whatsit, I <i>do</i> see where you&#039;re coming from,&quot; the Awake master of chaos replied. &quot;But you&#039;ve made one little itty bitty error in judgement.&quot; He held his talons so close together that the gap between could only be perceived through the magnifying glass he&#039;d conjured into his claw.</p><p class="double">&quot;If you speak of actually <i>liking</i> them, you will only confirm that you are bound,&quot; the demonic centaur dismissed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I <i>do</i>, but that&#039;s not why you&#039;re wrong. Your mistake is thinking that <i>they</i> have corrupted <i>me</i>. I assure you, it&#039;s quite the opposite.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;These enfeebled equines are your idea of chaotic?&quot; Tirek snorted, waving a hand to encompass the town in a gesture. &quot;You <i>have</i> been tamed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The average pony will <i>always</i> be boring as mud next to the exceptional ones,&quot; Discord stated, pulling down a chart displaying a standard bell curve in demonstration. &quot;It&#039;s why they&#039;re average. Wait,&quot; he blinked and glared at the graph. &quot;When did I learn <i>statistics?!</i> I <i>hate</i> knowing the odds!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you see?&quot; The centaur cackled, &quot;without even realizing, you-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmph, Twilight&#039;s influence no doubt,&quot; the draconequus interrupted, briefly turning the other&#039;s words into a speech balloon so he could literally trample over them. &quot;But we&#039;re straying from the topic at hand. Did you know that Celestia once banished the entirety of Equestria to the Moon so that she could take time off to do some surfing? Or that Luna has occasionally turned the Moon into a spaceship and taken it on joyrides? And that&#039;s positively <i>tame</i> next to what Tia&#039;s student gets up to, to say nothing of the sheer variety of tree sap related mayhem I&#039;ve been privy to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your point being?&quot; Tirek asked, his good mood fading as the speech went on.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m freer than I&#039;ve ever been, and all the better for it because I have friends who, despite their protestations, are just as crazy as I am!&quot; He twirled a talon next to his ear, which got caught on the end and caused his whole head to twist about. &quot;You really don&#039;t have anything to offer me.&quot; He tapped his chin thoughtfully, &quot;well, that&#039;s a lie, but Twilight&#039;s still sore about the library getting destroyed so I&#039;m going to be considerate and put off anything involving you for a few Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Enough of this prattle,&quot; he opened his maw wide and attempted draw in magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Agreed,&quot; Discord answered, shoving a spoon of cod liver oil into the villain&#039;s mouth. &quot;But, as I am not so heartless or dull as your previous jailors, you can be assured that your new cell will be a <i>significant</i> improvement.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek, still gagging, vanished between one moment and the next.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i><b>&quot;CRYSTALS?&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">&quot;For the <i>last time!</i>&quot; The ancient scourge proclaimed, &quot;unless granulated silicate counts, there are no <i>damnable crystals</i> here!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Twilight asked, watching the two unrepentant monsters bicker through a scrying mirror. Tirek had given up on trying to consume Sombra and settled on throwing coconuts at him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Unless you can find me new episodes of Gilligan&#039;s Island,&quot; Discord answered, shoveling a clawful of popcorn into his mouth. &quot;This is going to keep happening.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.6 (Misterq)</p><p class="double">Spike pulled the book lever that controlled the hidden passage and then stopped. The book on the pedestal was far different than it was in baseline.</p><p class="double">Instead of being formed from two stone tablets, the cover was a contorted face. Also, there were ephemeral whispers emanating from it that sounded something like, &quot;klaatu, barada,..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope!&quot; Spike said as he backed away and closed the secret passage shut, &quot;Not this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">And just for good measure, the little dragon used his fire breath to fuse the stones together so that no pony would try to get at that particular tome.</p><p class="double">Spike snorted in annoyance at one particular loop memory, &quot;Last thing Equestria needs is Pinkie Pie and Trixie fighting over the Necronomicon again. Even if my dragon-fire chainsaw gauntlet was pretty awesome.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;Good boy, Cerberus,&quot; Twilight said, ending the belly rub on the guardian of Tartarus. &quot;I&#039;ll be done here in just a few minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chained to the deepest pit in the tallest spire in the netherworld of Equestria, the wizened, powerless Tirek glared up at the alicorn princess. &quot;Come to gloat, have you, pony?&quot; he wheezed.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, actually,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I&#039;m just here to take care of a little bit of unfinished business.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then do it and be gone,&quot; Tirek hissed. &quot;I wish to be alone while I plot my vengeance.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll try to make this quick.&quot; Twilight hovered, wings flapping just above where Tirek could stretch the chains to grasp at her. &quot;I want to say, first off, that I deplore your situation. I firmly disapprove of corporal punishment in all its forms.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good to know,&quot; Tirek said. &quot;I share no such weakness.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I would therefore like you to think of this as a musical instrument.&quot; Twilight flared her magic and summoned a teacher&#039;s paddle slightly longer and taller than a London bus. &quot;And you&#039;re going to assist me in performing a little song of my own composition.&quot;</p><p class="double">Flames burst from Twilight&#039;s mane and tail, and her eyes glowed white as she shrieked, &quot;It&#039;s called <b>We Do Not Burn Down Libraries!!</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">A few minutes later Twilight returned to the surface world, towing a giant paddle broken in half behind her. At the crack leading down into Tartarus sat Vinyl Scratch next to a large stack of recording equipment. &quot;Hey, Princess, whassup?&quot; the DJ asked. &quot;Feel better now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, half of me feels really ashamed of myself,&quot; Twilight admitted. &quot;But the other half feels much, much better, yes, thank you. What did you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, kind of disappointing,&quot; Vinyl shrugged. &quot;Hate to say it, Sparkle, but you just haven&#039;t got any rhythm. Zero. Nada. On permanent backorder. Besides,&quot; she continued, ignoring Twilight&#039;s flushed expression, &quot;he never cried for his mommy or any of that. But the OTHER guys! I got enough from them for every Nightmare Night for a thousand Loops!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So long as it wasn&#039;t a total loss,&quot; Twilight grumbled, resolving not to give in to base impulses next time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.8 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Anakin Skywalker Awoke, took a rasping breath through his respirator, and silently cursed his luck. Despite his best efforts, the Loops refused to dispense with the services of Darth Vader, Parbroiled Evil Behind a Mask.</p><p class="double">The Jedi Looper took a moment to file through his Loop memories, which seemed true to baseline up until... well... moments ago. Vader&#039;s ship, the Star Destroyer <i>Devastator</i>, had pursued the Alderaanian embassy ship <i>Tantive IV</i> into hyperspace after the latter ship intercepted a signal from known Rebel agents. However, both ships had run into an uncharted gravitational anomaly, the sort of thing that usually ended with a ship never being heard from again. The ships had been dumped out into entirely uncharted space, with a life-bearing planet in the distance, and the ambassador&#039;s corvette opening up ground in a race for the planet.</p><p class="double">Not far from the blue-white planet, a large object began moving towards the Rebel ship. &quot;Look, they&#039;re heading for that space station,&quot; the Star Destroyer&#039;s captain said. &quot;Pursue and intercept. Don&#039;t let them make rendezvous.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vader reached out with the Force, and what he sensed both shocked and amused him. Barely able to keep the amusement out of his voice, he rumbled, &quot;That&#039;s no space station. That&#039;s a moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Perhaps his luck wasn&#039;t as bad as he&#039;d feared. He&#039;d been hoping for a Loop like this for quite some time now...</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s that, m&#039;lord?&quot; The captain looked through the bridge windows at the round object, growing larger by the moment. &quot;It can&#039;t be a moon, it&#039;s clearly maneuvering for...&quot; He trailed off into silence as the object began to rotate, revealing craters and shadows... shadows that formed the head of a unicorn with a downcast gaze.</p><p class="double">And then the eye facing the Devastator opened, an angry red glow appearing in the black and white moonscape.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... the... er... moon is accelerating towards us, Captain,&quot; a helm officer reported. &quot;It&#039;s ignoring the Rebel ship. Perhaps we should take evasive action?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes...&quot; the captain murmured. &quot;Yes, I think you&#039;re right! Full reverse! All auxiliary power to the engines!&quot;</p><p class="double">The Star Destroyer rocked and shuddered for several seconds before the safety systems took the main reactors offline. Emergency lights switched on across the bridge.</p><p class="double">&quot;You can&#039;t win, Captain,&quot; Vader said. &quot;But there are other ways of fighting. I recommend infiltration from within...&quot;</p><p class="double">A few minutes later, in a flash of un-light, an armored quadruped appeared on the Imperial ship&#039;s bridge. &quot;Kneel, miserable creatures!&quot; the lizard-eyed beast shouted. &quot;I am Nightmare Moon, and you have dared to intrude into my domain!&quot;</p><p class="double">Vader relaxed and let the Force flow through him, probing around the newcomer. The Dark Side was strong with her; sadness and regret, but also immense bitterness, jealousy and rage. The creature was powerful; a non-Awake Vader would have had a roughly equal fight. Anakin Skywalker, on the other hand, with Loop experience and power, could probably take her out in moments.</p><p class="double">But that wouldn&#039;t be amusing, or friendly. Besides, there was a question to ask.</p><p class="double">&quot;One moment,&quot; Vader rumbled, stepping forward.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you the one in command of these wretches?&quot; Nightmare Moon sneered. &quot;&#039;Tis well you hide behind a mask, if you are uglier than these bizarre creatures of yours!&quot;</p><p class="double">It was well he hid behind a mask, period. It was all Anakin could do to keep from cracking up. &quot;I have but one question,&quot; he said, deepening his voice to keep it from breaking with laughter. &quot;Are you Awake?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What sort of foolish question is this?&quot; The evil alicorn strode towards Vader. &quot;Do you think this is some sort of dream? Think again!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Ah. Not Awake, then.</i></p><p class="double">Anakin remembered the favorite phrase of a much different Emperor he&#039;d served one Loop, in a vastly smaller small-e empire.</p><p class="double"><i>Let&#039;s see what happens.</i></p><p class="double">The bridge crew of the <i>Devastator</i> watched in slack-jawed amazement as Vader bent his knee to the deck, bowing his head humbly. &quot;What is thy bidding, my Mistress?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon, Twilight Sparkle, and the five stone Elements of Harmony vanished.</p><p class="double">&quot;TWILIGHT!&quot; six voices shouted in surprise.</p><p class="double">&quot;We gotta go after her!&quot; Rainbow Dash shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;You have your own problems to worry about, ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Six pairs of eyes looked to the shadows to see a tall bipedal figure in black armor and cape stride forward. A lightsaber ignited in his hands, illuminating his form in eerie red highlights.</p><p class="double">If any of them could have pierced his mental shields to read his thoughts, they would have heard: <i>How I love a dramatic entran- who&#039;s that?</i></p><p class="double">Only five pairs of eyes belonged to ponies. The sixth belonged to a human woman clad in a slightly torn white dress. A loud hiss heralded the activation of her own lightsaber.</p><p class="double">&quot;Girls, go after your friend,&quot; Princess Leia Organa said. &quot;I&#039;ll deal with this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lightsabers clashed, and the ponies galloped off.</p><p class="double">A few brisk swings and parries later, Anakin said, &quot;I see you&#039;re wide-Awake, my daughter.&quot; He disengaged just in time for the startled Jedi to swing wide.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anak- Father??&quot; Leia gasped. &quot;If you&#039;re Awake, then why are you doing this? Your ship is poised over Equestria ready to rain destruction down on a single word from you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A word which will not be given, of course,&quot; Anakin replied. &quot;I put the fear of the Dark Side into the captain. He will accept orders only from me. So, the ponies are quite safe.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You still-&quot; swing, clash- &quot;haven&#039;t explained-&quot; swing, clash- &quot;WHY!&quot; swing, clash, grind of coalesced plasma beams.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, to see what happens, of course.&quot; Anakin pushed Leia back a few steps, stepped backwards himself, and deactivated his lightsaber. &quot;I&#039;ve been looking forward to seeing Equestria for a long time. But Darth Vader cannot simply walk into Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Leia muttered. &quot;Oh. <i>Ooooh.</i>&quot; She smiled a small smile and added, &quot;Have I ever mentioned you seem to have a habit of doing things the hard way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You and Obi-Wan both,&quot; Anakin replied. &quot;You briefly incapacitated me and ran to join your friends. Good enough?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Works for me,&quot; Leia said, reaching out with the Force and toppling the stand which had held the Elements towards Vader. He feigned a brief difficulty with it before levitating it back to its proper position, by which time Leia was on her way up the steps.</p><p class="double">Darth Vader&#039;s boots struck sparks on the stone floor as he ran after her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So!&quot; Nightmare Moon ground the fragments of the Elements of Harmony under her hoof. &quot;Your pathetic attempt to harness the Elements has failed! So much for your pathetic rebellion!&quot; She stepped aside to allow Vader to stand next to her. &quot;Now you shall watch as Ponyville is blasted into oblivion!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think so, Nightmare Moon!&quot; Twilight Sparkle grinned. &quot;Even as we speak Alliance and pony commandos have docked with your ship and taken over its bridge! There won&#039;t be any destruction today!&quot;</p><p class="double">Vader glanced over the ponies&#039; heads. Leia shrugged. <i>Sorry! Didn&#039;t know!</i></p><p class="double">The visitors from a galaxy far, far away listened as Twilight named the various Elements represented by her friends, ending with her own identity as the Element of Magic. As each was named, the appropriate Element materialized on the appropriate pony, who rose into the air. Anakin, watching it all through the Force, was deeply impressed. The magic was interwoven with something like the best qualities of the grey-sider Force he&#039;d seen around the Loops- leaning heavily towards the light. It reminded him very much of the baseline, of the moment when Darth Vader, given mercy and love by a long-lost son, had become Anakin Skywalker once more.</p><p class="double">Then the rainbow beam connecting the ponies lashed out at both Nightmare Moon and himself, and he had just enough time to think that this also reminded him of the baseline, only he hoped it wouldn&#039;t hurt as much as Palpatine&#039;s lightning.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Anakin sat up. It hadn&#039;t hurt... exactly... but... it had been most peculiar indeed. The Dark Side had fled him like a thief in the night, and the Light had burned him with a total absence of pain.</p><p class="double">His helmet and mask sat next to him. He took a deep breath; his lungs worked fine. He raised his hands, feeling the Force flow through living flesh and bone. He reached up and grabbed a long lock of hair- blonde, but mixed with some strands of gray.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;I&#039;ve had much less pleasant reconstructive surgery than that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Give your horrid sense of humor a rest, Father,&quot; Leia chuckled. &quot;Don&#039;t you have something to tell Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple pony in question was staring at the former Sith Lord with a cocked eyebrow and an expectant smirk.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... er...&quot; Anakin raised his left hand and parted his fingers two by two. &quot;Live long and prosper?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome to the Equestrian Loop, Anakin,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;Now do you mind doing something about the ship you have double-parked over Cloudsdale? This is meant to be a sanctuary Loop, after all.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Mommy, why are you hanging out with a random assortment of ponies and doing a bunch of weird things with them?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy Do (this time) gave Dinky Doo a smile. &quot;The multiverse is broken, dear, so me and those other ponies all got caught up in a time loop while things are fixed. We do the weird things because we&#039;re bored.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; The filly considered this for a long time. &quot;You still love me, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dinky Do, I will always love you, no matter what happens.&quot; Ditzy wrapped her youngest up in a hug. &quot;Hey, why don&#039;t you come with me? We&#039;re planning a prank on princess Celestia.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That sounds fun!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;...and so the magic harmonizes, creating large scale heartsongs.&quot; Lyra turned to the crowd of foals with a mischievous smirk. &quot;Well, at least for Pinkie Pie!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was some scattered giggling at that.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now then, are there any questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it true miss Bonbon is pregnant?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I refuse to answer on the grounds she&#039;d beat me up either way,&quot; the unicorn deadpanned, to more giggling. &quot;Any questions related to the subject matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Can you do a heartsong right now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra tapped her chin. &quot;I cooooooould, but I won&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cause it wouldn&#039;t be as special, silly filly!&quot; The bell rang just then. &quot;Plus I&#039;m out of time anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well then!&quot; Cheerilee rose from her seat with a smile. &quot;Everypony say thank you to miss Lyra for agreeing to be a guest lecturer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you miss Lyra!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! Miss Lyra was my grandmother!&quot; Lyra grinned. &quot;Now for your homework, I want you all to try to start some spontaneous heartsongs!&quot;</p><p class="double">A series of groans answered her.</p><p class="double">&quot;And the best way for you to do that is to go have fun!&quot;</p><p class="double">The groans turned into cheers, and the foals all ran out the door. Cheerilee shook her head and smiled. &quot;You have quite the way with foals, Lyra.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s because I practically am one.&quot; The unicorn smirked. &quot;Or don&#039;t you remember our spy adventures?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh I remember them, all right... Twilight was always getting us two out of jams. When she wasn&#039;t brainwashed.&quot; Cheerilee giggled. &quot;Seriously, that happened every other week!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think the bad guys cottoned onto her being our leader,&quot; Lyra mused, packing up her lyre. &quot;They underestimated the raw awesome us two had though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee gave her a long look. &quot;...How&#039;s the... mind window thing? Is it still a problem?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...A bit, yeah.&quot; Lyra shrugged. &quot;I actually found out that it&#039;s... easier, in a way, for me to be around ponies. I get more windows, yeah, but I also get... well, more references in the now. If that makes any sense.&quot; She turned to the schoolteacher. &quot;How about you? I heard that the loops and your talent...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee sighed. &quot;I&#039;m coping. Really! It&#039;s not as... listless as it was before. I&#039;ve just got to remember that I took this job to help children grow, not pack them with knowledge.&quot; She waggled a hoof. &quot;It&#039;s a balancing act, but... I&#039;m coping. Berry&#039;s helping out too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...look at us,&quot; Lyra said quietly. &quot;Dregs of the loops. Okay, let&#039;s make an oath right now: Whenever we&#039;re both awake, we&#039;ll.... do something together! Like this teaching thing, or just hit the clubs, maybe get boozed. Whatever. Sound good?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure thing, Lyra.&quot; Cheerilee nodded. &quot;This was... fun, actually. I&#039;d like to make it regular, but mismatched Awakenings and all...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">Well, this is an interesting Loop. I&#039;d found myself as a member of the Belmont clan. And wouldn&#039;t you know it, it was in time for Dracula to return, as he always does around here. Though, as far as I know, the only looper I&#039;ve heard of, Alucard, is still in his slumber. So, I&#039;d have to go it alone.</p><p class="double">Though I did have the legendary whip of the Belmont clan, I&#039;d remembered hearing that non-Belmonts who wield it at full power lose a bit of their life with every swing of the whip.</p><p class="double">I&#039;ll stick to my Keyblade, thank you. Don&#039;t want to risk using the whip, in case it doesn&#039;t truly see me as a Belmont due to the nature of the Loops.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As I&#039;d expected, the journey through Dracula&#039;s Castle was a tough one. Nearly died a few dozen times. When I finally got to the Throne Room, instead of Dracula, I met his reincarnation, Soma.</p><p class="double">Soma, ever since his Awakening to the Loops, tended to Loop in the role of his past self. He was curious as to my strength, so we did indeed fight. Soma was very unpredictable, using every trick in his playbook, not sticking to his past self&#039;s usual formula. I went all-out as well. I barely won that fight; even a couple of Loops like this from Soma meant he had plenty more combat experience than I do.</p><p class="double">Still, to beat such a foe...My skills have vastly improved since that fateful first Fused Loop of mine. The old me would be very arrogant at the power I wield, but I&#039;m not her anymore.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In my travels, I&#039;d heard of variants of Equestria that, well...were not good. If I ever enter one of those variants, I&#039;ll be prepared.</p><p class="double">Hopefully, I&#039;ll get a Loop or two to relax in soon. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;AAAAAAAAUGHRAAAAAAH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked. &quot;Ah... what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis winced. &quot;I... may have brainwashed her in the baseline.&quot; She bit her lip. &quot;Um... sorry, Lyra. I swear I don&#039;t do that anymore.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;RIGHT!&quot; Lyra took a deep breath and relaxed her grip. &quot;Er. Right. Trixie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she the one you suggested help me with my issues?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. &quot;Hive mind and all that.&quot; She tilted her head. &quot;Would you like to come down from the tree?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, I&#039;m good.&quot; Lyra waved a hoof casually. &quot;Being where a pony can&#039;t reach me is convincing my instincts I&#039;m safe.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis buzzed her wings. &quot;...You know, to help I kind of need to connect to your mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, sorry, my phobia won&#039;t let me. No offence to looping you but nonlooping you is a bi--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She is my marefriend,&quot; Trixie growled.</p><p class="double">&quot;...no, I&#039;m still saying it. Nonlooping Chrysalis is a big fat meanie.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.12 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, I gotcha that Nightmare Moon has already been defeated through music however many times,&quot; Vinyl Scratch said as she finished levitating several musical instruments along with her turntables onto the Ponyville city hall stage, &quot;It&#039;s just that I want to do it my own way; DJ P0N3 remix style.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, Vinyl. What do you need us to do?&quot; Twilight said. She and all of her friends were were awake, along with just about all of the other pony loopers. In fact, only Celestia and Luna were their baseline selves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, you take rhythm guitar,&quot; the white musical unicorn told her. Twilight nodded and pulled out her favorite guitar from her storage pocket.</p><p class="double">Vinyl continued, &quot;Dash, you&#039;re fast. So you take lead guitar. Applejack, you&#039;ve got bass. Rarity, you&#039;re on keyboards.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity looked over the sheet notes Vinyl had given her and scowled, &quot;But there&#039;s no keyboards in this song.&quot;</p><p class="double">The DJ sighed, &quot;I noticed, but that&#039;s your best instrument. Just freestyle along or something. I&#039;m sure you can make the whole thing.. what&#039;s that word you use? Fab-something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fabulous?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that it. Do that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I do suppose I can manage that,&quot; The fashionista nodded after briefly thinking on the topic.</p><p class="double">Vinyl turned to Fluttershy, &quot;You have the best voice out of all of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot; Rainbow Dash exclaimed and was promptly ignored.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you&#039;re lead vocals. That okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus nodded. Even after all this time, she still never cared too much for public performances, but she didn&#039;t rapidly shrink away from them unlike her baseline self.</p><p class="double">Vinyl looked at the quiet pony for a brief moment, &quot;I&#039;ll have to make sure to turn up your mic gain all the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she looked over at the last, grinning member of the original pony loopers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, Pinkie Pie. This piece has some of the most challenging drumwork I&#039;ve ever seen, and that&#039;s in its original form. This is going to be a hard house techno remix, with all the bpms that implies. Usually, the percussion is done by a drum machine; but you want to do this acoustically. Are you sure you can handle...&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl could practically feel the glare the pink looper was shooting her way, &quot;Right. I forgot what pony I was speaking to.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gave a big smile, made a happy noise, and spun her drumsticks so fast they hummed.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m on my turntables. Places, every pony. The &#039;Tribute to the Night&#039; concert is about to begin!&quot;</p><p class="double">Baseline Nightmare Moon was nothing if not predictable in her appearance.</p><p class="double">Except this time, it was a different pony who answered her question.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know who you are!&quot; Vinyl&#039;s voice reached out throughout the crowd as she spoke into her mic, &quot;You&#039;re the Princess of the Night, Princess Luna! And to herald your arrival, we&#039;re here to do a concert just for you! Ready, every pony? One, two, three, hit it!&quot;</p><p class="double">The guitars got going, playing at a faster pace than was normal for this song. Vinyl got busy adding various mood effects from her controls. Smoke, strobes, and magical lights flashed about, courtesy of Trixie.</p><p class="double">Then Pinkie Pie went wild on the drums, easily keeping perfect timing despite the almost supernatural speed needed. At times, Vinyl thought it looked like the pink pony had grown another set of limbs just to manage. The DJ pony then shook her head and started concentrating on her part of the music.</p><p class="double">&quot;Say your prayers little one.</p><p>Don&#039;t forget my son,</p><p>to include everyone,&quot; Fluttershy sang as loud as she could. With the added amplification, it was loud enough that all the assembled ponies could hear her.</p><p class="double">&quot;I tuck you in, warm within.</p><p>Keep you free from sin.</p><p>&#039;Til Princess Luna comes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sleep with one eye open,</p><p>Gripping your pillow tight&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exit light,</p><p>Enter night.</p><p>Be our friend,</p><p>We&#039;ll make it a much better land!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Come on up, Princess Luna! You know the words!&quot; Vinyl Scratch beckoned the stunned princess of the night over with her hoof, &quot;Come on, Princess. Do you see how much ponies love the night?&quot;</p><p class="double">All the attending ponies cheered and swayed, enjoying the concert immensely.</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. &quot; Nightmare Moon looked to either side, not really knowing how to react. She had expected the ponies to be frightened of her, even terrified. A tribute in her honor was nowhere in her plans.</p><p class="double">&quot;Get on up here,&quot; The sunglasses-wearing DJ waved her over, still bobbing her head to the beat, &quot;I&#039;m sure you have a wonderful singing voice!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A.. alright,&quot; Luna could have dropped her Nightmare Moon look then and there as she walked onto the stage, but her new outward appearance seemed more in line with the heavy pounding music and wild celebratory atmosphere.</p><p class="double">Then she started singing.</p><p class="double">Vinyl Scratch was right. Luna could sing perfectly in tune and on key, much to the delight of the crowd.</p><p class="double">Unlike Fluttershy, there was no need for a microphone to amplify her voice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.13 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">Applejack stood beside Twilight, as they looked at the ruins of the library she had called home, for the last five, times *<i>error, invalid integer</i>*, years. They were the only two Awake this loop, and had managed to take down Tirak with minimal fuss, aside from a single stray shot.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t understand.&quot; Twilight finally spoke. &quot;Every time he gets loose, my library explodes.&quot; She paused to sniffle. &quot;<i>Every time</i>. And I&#039;m still narrowing down when he escapes. It varies, did you know? Various contributing butterflies, and all. I&#039;m working on an adaptive detection array, going to test it on Tartarus next loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You really mean, every loop? He always gets it, no matter what you do to protect your library?&quot; Applejack found it hard to believe Twilight couldn&#039;t protect her home, not from a baseline enemy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Every time. A few loops ago, Luna was Awake. We moved Tartarus to the moon. Whole thing, pow, to the moon! Tirak still escaped, drained the other prisoners there, before coming back to Equestria. He <i>landed</i> on the library, cratered it.</p><p class="double">Last time, last time, I put my library on the moon. Just picked up the whole library, put it on the moon.

He was the Maker of Worlds, who&#039;s skillful ability could shape entire universes. To those less charitable to his condition, he was known as the Lame One. But never to his face, of course.

She knew that Dash could not resist having at least one fight scene in her stories...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p>This Loop was more of the more interesting ones, in my opinion. I Awoke in a part of Russia as a spy. My codename:</p><p class="double">EVA.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t long before I met the Anchor of this Loop: the man who would be known as Big Boss; I&#039;d heard his tale from Peter Parker.</p><p class="double">Big Boss earned that codename of his by having to stop a madman...and kill his mentor, The Boss, thought to be a traitor. When he learned the truth- that she was loyal to the end, but circumstances had forced her to die branded a traitor- he, alongside his allies from that fateful mission, had formed a group called &#039;The Patriots&#039; to realize the Boss&#039; dream of a world united. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">However, Big Boss and Major Zero disagreed on how to do this: Big Boss thought that soldiers needed to be have no nation to be tied to, and Zero wanted to control the populace through manipulation. When Big Boss was cloned by Zero, that was the last straw, and the two would enter a secret war that Big Boss&#039; own cloned &#039;son&#039;, Solid Snake, would one day end, first by defeating Big Boss, then, nearly 20 years later, tore down the Patriots...or rather, the AIs Zero&#039;d entrusted to carry out his will.</p><p class="double">It is a VERY long and complicated story. Moving on, Big Boss was obviously quick to realize I wasn&#039;t who was usually in this role. After a quick explaination, BB(he chuckled at the cute nickname) had to admit; he&#039;d heard stranger tales since his Looping days began. He also told me that Solid Snake had Awoken a few Loops after he had at the earilest. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">We proceeded with things more or less as per baseline. Though, that Ocelot guy...he seemed to be showing signs that he&#039;s seen this before...I&#039;ve a feeling he may Awaken in the next few Loops.</p><p class="double">It was interesting living 50 years of life alongside Big Boss. He is the ultimate soldier; he&#039;s been a warrior throughout all his Looping days. He doesn&#039;t try to rely on special powers like ki or chakra(though he knows how), but prefers to use gunplay and his own brand of hand-to-hand called CQC. He&#039;s picked up plenty of technology, though. And the guy has charisma not unlike that of great leaders. No wonder many soldiers&#039;d follow him to their death.</p><p class="double">As for what I experienced this Loop...it was full of intrigue and espionage. And it was as confusing as I&#039;ve heard. By the time I met Solid Snake(who luckily enough, was Awake as well, and is just like the stories about him say), things had gone relatively close to baseline, though BB had someone else get roasted by Snake during what would&#039;ve been their second battle. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">That, and he decided to take out the Patriots ahead of schedule this time. BB and his &#039;son&#039; patched things up a long time ago. During their reunion, I heard them mention an epic battle where every known Awake Looper at the time(AKA before I Awoke), along with a lot of Unawake villains had fought on Pelennor Fields. And I mean ALL of them.</p><p class="double">I missed what was probably the greatest battle the Multiverse will ever know. I don&#039;t know how to feel about that.</p><p class="double">And for them, the battle was a good case of father-son bonding time.</p><p class="double">This Loop has had me see what constant struggle can do to a person even when the Loops aren&#039;t involved. I have to admire guys who can handle all of that.</p><p class="double">As the Loop ended, ol&#039; BB gave me a hint of what he was hoping to do next Loop: become President.</p><p class="double">Good luck, Jack... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">96.18</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Applejack sat nervously in an uncomfortable plastic chair (<i>How does Lyra do this?</i>) as the lights came on in the Los Pegasus television studio.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tonight&#039;s contestant owns a large apple farm near Ponyville.

Finding none that weren&#039;t embarrassing, she picked the one that made her squirm the least. &quot;We&#039;re havin&#039; a romantic candlelit dinner.

Unfortunately my preferred diet seldom... agrees with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s enough hints,&quot; Cadence said, walking back around the partition. &quot;Applejack, have you picked your final question?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One question and I&#039;m done? You promise?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course! Those are the rules of the game!&quot; Cadence insisted. &quot;So what&#039;s the question?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack, groaning, picked one of the other cards at random. She read it and groaned as she realized it was one of the worst. &quot;Um... in... in th&#039; bedroom... do I haveta say this? In th&#039; bedroom, would y&#039;all say yer a... a speed sprinter... a steeplechase jumper... or a long hauler?&quot; As soon as she finished she tossed the card away like it was on fire, grabbing her hat with one hoof and covering her face with it. &quot;Ah cain&#039;t believe ah just said that...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooooh, that&#039;s hitting below th-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;CADENCE!!!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, all right,&quot; the pink alicorn waved down Applejack. &quot;Bachelor Two, what&#039;s your answer?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I do not do the hauling,&quot; the raspy voice hissed. &quot;I find other ponies to do this for me. ALL the other ponies, everywhere, hauling cryyyyyysssstals for me!!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem,&quot; the deep voiced bachelor spoke. &quot;In the bedroom or anywhere else, let me just say... that I never stop until my goals are fully achieved.&quot; The audience oohed at that one.</p><p class="double">The pompous voice gave a groan of disgust. &quot;Hauling? Manual labor is SO undignified! And as genteel as the sport of steeplechase is, the mud puddles behind some of the jumps are simply intolerable! They&#039;d muss my hooficure! So I&#039;d have to go with the speed sprint, common as it is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er.... riiiiight,&quot; Cadence said, struggling to keep her smile. &quot;Anyway, Applejack, you&#039;ve heard the responses of all the bachelors now. It&#039;s almost time to choose!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great! I choose Door Number One!&quot; Applejack said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hehe!

Bachelor Number One?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you&#039;re half as beautiful as me,&quot; the pompous voice declared, &quot;we&#039;ll be the talk of Canterlot society!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bachelor Number Two?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You will ssssubmit to me! It is inevitable!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Or Bachelor Number Three?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t wait to see what you&#039;re made of,&quot; the deep voice said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yer not gonna let me leave this stage unless I pick one o&#039;these bozos, huh?&quot; Applejack asked. &quot;Fine. Bachelor Number One sounds like a stuck up nancy-boy who&#039;d never last five minutes on a farm. Bachelor Number Two sounds like he just escaped from a world court trial, accused of crimes against equinity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you know?&quot; the raspy voice gasped.</p><p class="double">&quot;So I reckon I gotta go with th&#039; third one. He sounds like a steady pony. He sure can&#039;t be as bad as th&#039; other two!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So your final selection,&quot; Cadence said carefully, &quot;is Bachelor Number Three?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If none of th&#039; above ain&#039;t an option,&quot; Applejack said, &quot;then yup, Bachelor Number Three it is!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence grinned. &quot;Come on out, Bachelor Number Three!&quot;</p><p class="double">As the theme music played and lights began to dim on the other side of the partition, a large figure rounded its side and came into view.</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s a magic-devouring centaur from beyond the badlands,&quot; Cadance read from an index card. &quot;His hobbies include dancing, long walks on the beach, and global domination!

I’ll call you every morning, and we’ll only be gone for a week.” Yugi hugged Solomon, grabbed his bags, and headed for the door. “Bye, Grandpa.”</p><p class="double">“Goodbye Yugi, and good luck. I can’t have you and Josie embarrassing me now, can I?”</p><p class="double">Yugi rolled his eyes. As he headed through the door, he called back “You got it, Grandpa.”</p><p class="double">After the door closed behind him, he leant back on the wall.</p><p class="double"><i>Are you alright, Yugi? </i>Yami asked.</p><p class="double"><i>I’m fine; just wish Grandpa would start looping already. </i>Yugi replied, sighing heavily.</p><p class="double"><i>Would you like me to take over for a while?</i></p><p class="double"><i>That’d help. Thanks, Yami.</i></p><p class="double">Just as Yami took Yugi’s place, their cab arrived.</p><p class="double">“Where to, kid?”</p><p class="double">“Domino Harbour, please.”</p><p class="double">“Sure thing.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Yami arrived at the harbour, he wasn’t all too surprised to see that Twilight was already there.</p><p class="double">What did shock him was how little she had elected to bring with her. All she had was one backpack, and an ice box.</p><p class="double">“Given everything I know about you, I must admit I was expecting cases of books, Josie.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. She glanced around, amongst the hustle and bustle, trying to figure out how to word this without sounding crazy. Figuring there wasn’t any great option, she settled on saying “That’s what a Pocket’s for, Yugi.” Given the strange gymnastics his eyebrows started to pull, she carried on before he could respond. “So, any idea when Tea will be turning up?”</p><p class="double">”She shouldn’t be too much longer...”</p><p class="double">Almost as though on cue, a car pulled up, and Tea stepped out. “Thanks mom, I’ll call you tomorrow!” She called out as the car drove off once again, waving furiously after it. “Hey Yugi, Hey Josie.”</p><p class="double">Yami nodded at her, while Twilight waved.</p><p class="double">“Have you spoken to Tristan yet, Josie?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, he said he was getting the train into the city an hour ago. He’s going to call me when he gets to the Hospital. I just hope Serenity’s OK.”</p><p class="double">Tea bit her lip, as she looked around the crowd. “Maybe we should get on the ship? We don’t want all the good cabins to get taken, do we?”</p><p class="double">“That’s probably a good idea, actually...” Twilight said, as she picked up her bags. “Let’s go.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Yami pulled on their gloves, while Tea pulled a lanyard out from her shirt, with a visitor’s badge. They passed the guard without incident, and went to register.</p><p class="double">“Hmm... Mr Muto and Miss Wheeler... One moment please...” The receptionist said, as she searched through the system for their entries. “Ah, it appears you have rooms reserved...”</p><p class="double">A small machine beside her beeped, and she inserted a small plastic card into it. After a few seconds she removed it, and handed it to Yami. “You have been assigned to suite 102, Mr Muto. Please enjoy the cruise, and good luck.”</p><p class="double">She then repeated the process with Tea, and then Twilight “Miss Wheeler, you have been assigned to suite 113. Please enjoy the cruise, and good luck.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After placing her bags in her rooms, Twilight met Tea and Yugi in their room.</p><p class="double">“Alright, so we’re stuck on this boat until tomorrow morning, right?” Twilight asked, as she sat next to Tea.</p><p class="double">“That‘s when we get to the Island, yeah.” Yugi replied</p><p class="double">“So is there anything we can do until then?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I usually make sure my deck is set up for my first duel – It’s almost like a fixed thing. Whenever I come to Duellist Kingdom, I fight the same person first.”</p><p class="double">“And who’s that?”</p><p class="double">“Weevil Underwood.” Tea said, gagging afterwards</p><p class="double">“I’m going to guess there’s a story behind that reaction...”</p><p class="double">Yugi took a breath. “There is, but I doubt you’d understand without actually seeing our Baseline. And Yami generally hates running that part of our Loop as Baseline, if it even occurs. Sometimes, the Loop just randomly skips it.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, I’ll take your word for it. So, other than counting to make sure all 60 are there, is there anything to do?”</p><p class="double">“There are usually people trading or practicing around the halls, but if you’re happy with your deck, I’d advise against it.”</p><p class="double">“You have anything I could want, and no need to give away my deck?” Twilight ventured.</p><p class="double">Yugi nodded. “Most of the other top duellists won’t be doing it, unless they want to test a back up deck or something. Which, really, leaves talking, unless either of you have something interesting in your Pocket we could use?”</p><p class="double">Tea shook her head “Not really.”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought for a few seconds, before something occurred to her. “Actually, I have something I’ve been meaning to ask you. When I visited Nyx the first time, she mentioned she couldn’t use her magic. I’ve been trying to use it, and I’m having trouble myself.” She pulled a notebook out of her coat, and flipped through a few pages. “Levitation is one of the most basic things in my world, so I started with that, and, well, this is the result.”</p><p class="double">Twilight handed Yugi the notebook. It didn’t take long to realise the page was covered with an extremely shaky signature. “Hmm... How does magic work in your world?”</p><p class="double">“Unicorns generally just focus on something. Our magic is contained in our horns, but it usually shifts to other appendages when we’re in other forms.”</p><p class="double">“So it’s not based on an external focus, then?”</p><p class="double">“No, but I do have a lot of them in my Pocket.”</p><p class="double">“And have you tried any of them yet?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I haven’t really had enough free time without someone watching. I barely had enough time to pull off this.” She indicated the notebook.</p><p class="double">“Then try using some of your other foci. Some of them may work, and we don’t really have a long list of alternatives to our in-Loop items yet.”</p><p class="double">“Got it. I should probably go get started.”</p><p class="double">Twilight got up from the bed, and headed over to the door, when someone started knocking on it.</p><p class="double">Twilight opened the door, and had to look down to find the person who had knocked. He had cropped sky blue hair, and gigantic rimmed glasses, with a beetle insignia on the ridge.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hello.” The newcomer spoke, looking up at Josie. “My name is Weevil, the new Regional Champion. I was wondering if it’s true Yugi Muto is here?”</p><p class="double">Twilight debated with herself before responding. “One sec.”</p><p class="double">She stepped back into the room. “Yugi, that Weevil kid is here. What do you want me to do?”</p><p class="double">Yugi and Tea stared at each other for a second, before nodding. “Alright, let him in.” Yugi said, before lowering his voice. “But you have to promise that you won’t do anything, until he’s gone, OK?”</p><p class="double">“Alright, I promise.” She said, dropping her voice to match Yugi’s. She headed back over to the door, where Weevil was still waiting. “Come on in.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, thank you.” Weevil said, grinning. <i>Well, he certainly looks a little strange, but that doesn’t mean anything...</i>She thought as he stepped past her.</p><p class="double">“Hello, Yugi.”</p><p class="double">“Hi, Weevil. Well done with the regionals.”</p><p class="double">“Oh come now, Yugi. The regionals are nothing compared to beating the World Number 1.”</p><p class="double">“You know about that?” Yugi asked, feigning surprise.</p><p class="double">“The whole world knows. The world number 1, humiliated by an amateur. And here you are, in his place.”</p><p class="double">“I just beat him in one duel, and it was pretty close.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t be modest, Yugi. With your Buster Blader, he never stood a chance.” He fidgeted for a second, before asking the question Yugi had been waiting for. “Could I... see it?”</p><p class="double">Yugi waited for a few seconds before responding. “Sure, it’s over here.” He opened up the case for his deck, and slid off the top card. He handed it over to Weevil, and watched as Weevil, as usual, walked around the room, before throwing the card out the window and running. As he left, he gloated “How will you win without that card now, Yugi?” Before devolving into maniacal laughter.</p><p class="double">Yugi rolled his eyes, before closing and locking the door. He reached into his Pocket, and pulled out a card. He placed it into his deck box. He turned to Twilight, who still seemed to be in a sort of shock from what had happened in front of her. “And that is just one of the reasons we hate Weevil.”</p><p class="double">“Duly noted...” Twilight said, before checking the time. “Well, I should get back to my room; I think Tristan will be calling me any time now.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, we’ll talk again later.” Yugi said, as Twilight walked out the door.</p><p class="double">“See you later.” Tea said.</p><p class="double">Twilight walked down the Hallway, and entered her room. She rooted through her bag, and waited for the call.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“-Stan? Where’d you go?” Tristan blinked as he woke up.</p><p class="double">“I’m here, Nyx. What’s wrong?”</p><p class="double">“Well, you came in and said you needed to sit down.” Nyx said, turning to face Tristan’s voice. “And that was an hour ago.”</p><p class="double">Tristan’s face practically shone red, and he smacked his forehead. “Damn, I’m sorry. Apparently, this loop has a lot of paperwork to sort out if you want to visit someone outside of visiting hours. I must have been more tired than I thought. But enough about that, how’re you holding up?”</p><p class="double">Nyx let her head sink into her pillow. “Better, I guess. I wish Momma was here, but I know why she can’t be.”</p><p class="double">Tristan smiled, as he plugged the last of the cables into his laptop, and waited for the thing to boot up. “Well, everything’s set up now, so all we can do is wait for it all to kick off. I did say I’d call Twilight when I got here...”</p><p class="double">A knock came at the door, and a nurse walked through a few seconds later. “Hello Serenity, I’m here to run you...” She started, until she noticed Tristan. “Sir, visiting hours have ended. Quite a while ago, in fact.”</p><p class="double">“I know, I know.” He said, as he pulled a small card out of his jacket pocket. He held it out to the nurse by the small pin on the back “I never got round to putting it on, I guess. Sorry about that.” He turned to Nyx “I’ll go make that call while they run the tests, ok?”</p><p class="double">Nyx sighed a little, before nodding.</p><p class="double">Tristan closed the door behind him, then leant against the door frame as he waited for Twilight to pick up.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sat in her room, sorting through her Pocket for whatever foci she could find. At either side were two piles of the objects she had tried. An extremely large notebook lay on her lap. She chewed her pencil absent mindedly as she pulled out her wand from her time at Hogwarts.</p><p class="double">“Alright, next up.” She said as she held the wand out in front of her, and took a deep breath before shouting “Lumos!” as loud as she dared.</p><p class="double">A faint glow appeared at the tip of her wand. Twilight nodded, and placed the wand into the much smaller of the two piles. She wrote a few lines next to her wands entry. Just as she was about to begin looking through her Pocket again, she heard the faint sound of music from somewhere behind her.</p><p class="double">Twilight thought for a few seconds before diving towards her bed, and swiping up her phone. “Tristan?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Yeah, it’s me. You guys set off yet?”</i></p><p class="double">“Not too long ago. What happened to you though? Did you get stuck in traffic again?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Nah, nothing like that. Just didn’t realise there was going to be so many forms I’d have to do. So by the time I got to Nyx’s room I was wiped. She finally got me to wake up not too long ago.” </i>Tristan gave a short nervous laugh, as Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">“So how is she?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Fine, but she misses you. I’d have let her talk to you, but the nurse came in to run her tests just as I was about to call. Figured it made more sense to do it like this. I’ll call again after every match. And don’t worry. Yugi and Tea told me what happened in the shop. You’ll do fine.”</i></p><p class="double">“And what if things don’t go like they should?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Then you roll with the punches. I don’t know what you’ve got in your bag of tricks, but I’d bet everything I have that yours is bigger and can deal with more stuff than mine. Just have faith in the Heart of the Cards, and you can’t fail.”</i></p><p class="double">“Even against Yami?”</p><p class="double">There was a slight chuckle before Tristan responded “<i>He’s not actually the one you need to worry about, really...”</i></p><p class="double">Twilight raised her eyebrow at that, but Tristan didn’t complete the thought, and decided it wasn’t worth pushing. “Alright, I’ll keep that in mind. Just make sure Nyx stay’s OK for me.”</p><p class="double">“<i>I would have done that anyway, but you probably knew that already. I’ll talk to you later, Josie.”</i></p><p class="double">“You too, Tristan.” Twilight tossed the phone back onto her bed, before picking her notebook and pencil back up. <i>Now, where was I?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>Twilight had just finished clearing up her room when there was a knock at her door.</p><p class="double">“Come in.” She called out just as she laid back on the bed.</p><p class="double">Tea stepped into the room. “Yami and I were wondering what you were up to. You went to wait for Tristan calling you, and we haven’t seen you since.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled sheepishly “Sorry, I got caught up in some research.” She opened her bedside table’s drawer, and pulled out her notebook. “Tell Yami or Yugi I’m sorry they’re not complete, but there were a couple of things that were just too big to bring out in this room.”</p><p class="double">Tea’s eyes widened as she flipped through the notebook. “You did all of this overnight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight debated whether to tell Tea how she had pulled it off, and decided that being vague was probably the best way to go. “Well, I found a few ways to use my magic, and a few other worlds as well. From there I just used some tricks I know to make it go a lot faster. Oh, and coffee. Coffee helped.”</p><p class="double">“Ok, well, we’re five minutes away from the harbour, so if you want to grab your bags, we can meet Yugi and head for the opening ceremony.”</p><p class="double">“Sure, just give me a minute.”Twilight said, dropping to the floor, and reaching under her bed. She pulled out her backpack and icebox “Ready when you are.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pegasus’ harbour was so narrow, it made the flock of people leaving the ship appear worse than in Domino. However, it was thankfully still a relatively short walk from the harbour to Pegasus’ Castle. There was a short wait before Pegasus appeared on his balcony, a glass of wine in his hand. He smiled, his eyes closed as he sipped at his drink, before he finally looked down to address the crowd.</p><p class="double">“Congratulations to you all.” He said as he raised his glass “To have made it this far, you must be the world’s greatest duellists. And so I welcome you to Duellist Kingdom.” He completed his toast before continuing. “However, a Kingdom has only one throne. I look forward to the coming week, and so, assemble your decks carefully, with guile and creativity. You have all been given 2 Star Chips, at least one of which must be wagered on every one of your duels.” Pegasus paused, both to scan the crowd, and to breathe. “Any person who can earn 10 or more will be given entry to my Castle, and the final stages of the tournament. Arenas have been placed throughout the island, which will become active in one hour. Feel free to prepare in any way you like, wherever you like. When the sky lights up with fireworks, you may begin.”</p><p class="double">He turned and exited down the same passageway he had came from. The crowd then erupted into various chattering. Twilight turned to face Yugi and Tea.</p><p class="double">“Well, that sounded strange.” She said, keeping her voice as low as she dared.</p><p class="double">“It actually didn’t sound all that different to what he usually says...” Yugi said, with Tea nodding in approval. “But, notice something?”</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow, before looking around. She spent a minute or two, before speaking up “It’s a group of people. I’m not sure what I’m looking for, here. A hint would be nice...”</p><p class="double">“Try looking for what’s not there...”</p><p class="double">“Huh?...” She took another look, before realising what was wrong “Hey, where’d that Weevil kid go?”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry. If he runs off, he always heads for the same place, just follow us.” Yugi said, before heading for one of the flights of stairs away from the Castle’s grounds “Be careful though. Some of these stairs are pretty old, so watch your footing.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Tea followed close behind, descending down into one of the islands thick forests.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Weevil was waiting for the group by the Forest Grove’s arena as Yugi, Twilight and Tea emerged into the clearing.</p><p class="double">“He he he, I was wondering how long it would be before you noticed I had gone.” Weevil said, leering at the trio over his glasses. Just as he finished speaking, the fireworks started.</p><p class="double">“Well, I guess there’s no sense waiting any longer then. Weevil, I challenge you to a duel.”</p><p class="double">“Gladly, little Yugi. We’ll duel for 2 Star Chips. After all, it wouldn’t do to have you running around anymore once I’ve proven you’re just a beginner who got lucky.” Weevil said, as he climbed into one of the podiums of the arena.</p><p class="double"><i>Alright, you want to take this one, or should I? </i>Yugi asked Yami as he approached his podium.</p><p class="double"><i>I think I should. Blader was always one of my cards... </i>came the response.</p><p class="double"><i>Got it. Good luck. </i>Yugi took a deep breath as he stepped into place, and switched. Yami placed his deck into its slot. Once it had been returned, he drew his hand, and looked over at Weevil. “Let’s Duel.”</p><p class="double">Yami looked over his hand. <i>Well Yugi, we have two of the cards we need. Sangan, Pot of Greed and Monster Reborn are all helpful too. I guess it all comes down to how soon we can get the third card we need.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Looks that way, but this is Weevil. Let’s just hope he isn’t cheating in some way we haven’t thought of.</i></p><p class="double">“I’ll start.” Yami announced, drawing another card from his deck. He saw the card he had added to his hand, and laughed briefly. “I’m sorry this was so short, Weevil.” He then turned to Twilight. “Josie, you will soon see what it was my Grandpa was attempting in your duel.”</p><p class="double">“First, I play the magic card Pot of Greed to draw even more cards, before I place this face down. Then, I’ll set this monster in defence mode, and end my turn.”</p><p class="double">“You seem to think you’ve already won, Yugi. Did you forget, there are always at least two people in a duel.” Weevil drew his card “I play this monster in face down defence mode. That ends my turn.” Weevil smiled as he played the card.</p><p class="double"><i>Well, this seems familiar... </i>Yugi thought. <i>Man Eater Bug?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Man Eater Bug </i>Yami agreed. <i>This is exactly what we needed, don’t you think?</i></p><p class="double">Yami drew another card, before looking over his hand. “I switch my Sangan to attack mode, and attack your face down monster.”</p><p class="double">Predictably, weevil began laughing maniacally. “Oh little Yugi, you already made your first mistake.” He flipped his Man Eater Bug, and the holographic Sangan vanished into the Graveyard. “Say goodbye to your pathetic monster. That will do nicely for now.&quot;</p><p class="double">“Are you done?” Yami asked, as he picked some dirt out from his nails and yawned. “Did you forget, my Sangan has a special ability? I can add one card to my hand, as long as it has less than 1500 attack points. I think my Exodia the forbidden one will do nicely, don’t you?” Yami held up the card as he slid it into his hand. “Now, since it is still my turn, and it worked so well before, I’d like my Sangan back. So I activate my Monster Reborn to resurrect my Sangan, in defence mode, then end my turn.”</p><p class="double">The holographic Sangan returned to the field, as Weevil started to, impressively, become even paler.”Th..Th...There’s no way you’ll be able to summon it in time.” He drew a card, and began to laugh again. “I summon my Cross Sword Beetle in attack mode. And, thanks to the field bonus from the Forest, he gains a 10% boost to his attack and defence points.”</p><p class="double">A large beetle appeared across from Sangan, and after a few seconds, it began increasing in size.</p><p class="double">“Now all I have to do is play a monster strong enough to take down any monsters you summon. You can’t possibly stall long enough to summon Exodia now, Yugi. Go ahead and make your move.”</p><p class="double">Yami took a look at the card he drew, and began to smirk. “Whoever said I needed to stall?”</p><p class="double">“What? You couldn’t have drawn the last piece already!”</p><p class="double">“You are right Weevil, I did not draw the last Exodia piece.” Yami said, still smirking, while weevil breathed a sigh of relief “However, I did draw a card that will give it to me.” He flipped around the Dark Hole he had drawn, and played it immediately. All the holograms disappeared from the field, and Yami&#039;s smirk never seemed to stop growing wider “You know what this means, right Weevil?”</p><p class="double">Weevil had been struck silent in disbelief. All he could do was watch as Yami spread the five pieces of the all-powerful Exodia across his field.</p><p class="double">The arena’s holograms began to blur, and sparks began to fly from the edges, as slowly, the limbs of the great beast broke free from their chains, and reunited with their body. Exodia howled as he stood, towering even above the forest canopy.</p><p class="double">Yami stared right at Weevil before giving his command. “Exodia, Obliterate!”</p><p class="double">The towering monster brought its arms together, and the hum of magic could be heard, as a strange light formed between its hands. A few seconds later, a large shaft of light enveloped Weevil and his entire side of the field. As his podium stared to lower, Yami looked across at Weevil one last time. “You lose.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The trio were silent as they left the forest, heading back towards the plains between the Harbour and Pegasus’ Castle. Eventually, Twilight turned to Yugi.</p><p class="double">“So, that was Solomon’s only chance, as he put it? An instant win? I can’t say that seems all that fair...”</p><p class="double">“Well, you need to have all five pieces. Which are rarer than you’re probably thinking – well, without a Pocket at least. And you’d be surprised how often we’re only allowed one of each piece in a deck. Personally, I don&#039;t like to use Exodia that often anyway. If you start relying on it, then a loop tends to get a little...”</p><p class="double">“Boring?” Twilight finished his sentence for him, then waited until he nodded before continuing “Don’t worry, I get it. I think most anchors feel like that at times. You just need to be careful about how you make it interesting again...”</p><p class="double">Suddenly, someone came running through the crowd towards them. They pulled up a few feet away, and almost collapsed as they tried to catch their breath. After a few seconds they looked up at the trio “You’re Yugi Muto, right? Solomon Muto’s Grandson?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that’s me.” Yugi said, trying to place the newcomer. They seemed familiar somehow, but Yugi couldn’t place them. “What do you want?”</p><p class="double">“I’m Mike Valentine, and I’m looking for the girl who beat him.” Mike said, looking down at Yugi “I’m assuming it’s you” Mike said, turning to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Yugi looked around, before lowering his voice. “How’d you know about that?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, pretty simple. One of your friends here has a guest pass, the other has a duelling glove on, and I know of all the female duellists good enough to actually make it here. There’d been a rumour that Solomon had lost to a rookie like Kaiba, but I didn’t want to believe it.”</p><p class="double">“Be careful.” Twilight said, staring at Mike warily “I beat him, I can beat you just as easily.”</p><p class="double">“Well, there is one way to test that theory...” Mike said, indicating a duelling arena that lay not far off. “What do you say to one Star Chip apiece. I don’t want to dash your hopes of making it big all at once, after all...”</p><p class="double"><i>Well, at least he ain’t pullin’ Mai’s two-bit Psychic bull... </i>Twilight heard someone say, but when she looked around, there wasn’t anyone anywhere close enough to have said it. “Alright, one star Chip.”</p><p class="double">Mike and Twilight approached the podium, and sorted their decks. After drawing their hands, Twilight studied her hand. <i>Well, my Magician Valkyria might come in handy in a turn or two, but everything else in here is useless right now. I need something good with my first draw, or I might end up like Solomon did before...</i></p><p class="double">“You can start.” She called across the arena.</p><p class="double">“Nah, Ladies first. I insist.” Mike replied.</p><p class="double">“If you’re sure...” Twilight said, drawing a card before he could respond. She looked down and smiled.</p><p class="double">“I’ll start by playing my Fortune Lady Earth, in attack mode.” Twilight placed her monster on the field, and began looking over her hand again. “And then...” She started, but lost her train of thought after seeing the fully realised holographic version of her card. It looked just like...</p><p class="double">“Applejack?...” Twilight whispered, as the rest of her cards slipped out of her fingers.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.2 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;Bad Loop?&quot; Big MacIntosh asked as Twilight Sparkle walked into his bar and sat down.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not so much bad as... really weird,&quot; Twilight said. Let me explain...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;But the princess said you were supposed to try and make friends!&quot; non-Awake Spike said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; Twilight said, turning her attention from Spike to Pinkie Pie...</p><p class="double">... except the pony they were walking up to was a Pie of a different color.</p><p class="double"><i>Maud? What&#039;s Maud doing here and now?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me-&quot; Twilight began.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Maud interrupted, her eyebrows rising marginally. Without another word the gray pony turned on her hooves and trotted off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hello,&quot; said the proprietress of Sweet Apple Acres. &quot;I&#039;m Apple Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">It was clearly Maud Pie wearing a cowboy hat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah... hello, Mau- er, Apple Pie,&quot; Twilight stammered. &quot;I&#039;m here to check on the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. All right.&quot; &quot;<i>Apple Pie</i>&quot; walked over to the triangle and rang it loudly, bringing a herd of Apple family (<i>Pie family?</i>) members running from all corners of the orchard. One shoved Twilight on a stool while the others piled plates of sweet apple-based foods in front of her until the shadow blotted out the noonday sun.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle... my family,&quot; Apple Pie said. &quot;Apples... Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HOWDY!&quot; dozens of voices responded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... what&#039;s all this for?&quot; Twilight asked, looking around the mighty mountain of food.</p><p class="double">&quot;Taste test,&quot; Apple Pie said, and that was all that needed saying.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Boo,&quot; a low voice said from above. A thunderbolt followed almost immediately.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up from the mud puddle to see a pony head peeking over the edge of a cloud. The faintest smile lingering on the gray pegasus&#039;s muzzle.</p><p class="double">Maud Pie, with wings. Of course. &quot;Maud Splash,&quot; probably.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">City Hall shimmered with tall pillars of highly polished rocks.</p><p class="double">And in the middle stood... Maud Pie, with a horn.</p><p class="double">Talking over Spike&#039;s drooling, Twilight learned her name was Rare Earths. <i>That might explain,</i> Twilight thought, <i>why some of these rocks are glowing without benefit of the sun...</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">And then there was the other winged Maud Pie- this one with a long mane that hung over her eyes. This one never spoke at all, but Twilight could feel a sort of empathic response whenever she asked a question. The empathic pulses were enough to goad Spike into giving his entire biography, without a word being spoken.</p><p class="double">Twilight would learn later that her name was &quot;Flutterpie.&quot; She had organized a rock band for the celebration. The music sounded strangely like a glass armonica, or someone playing wine glasses, or both...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Astonishingly, the Loop wasn&#039;t that different beyond that,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Except Maud Pie was the Element of Loyalty, and Maud Splash the Element of Laughter. Oh, and Discord&#039;s tricks had no effect on any of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Big Mac asked. &quot;How&#039;d they manage that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like this,&quot; Twilight said, ducking her head. When she looked back up her face held the expression she&#039;d carefully learned on that strange Loop- the half-lidded look that indicated an apparently infinite lack of interest in much of anything. Where Fluttershy had the Stare, Maud Pie had the Look.</p><p class="double">And Twilight kept Look-ing at Mac until he slowly sank below the bar level to get out of her sight.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.3 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">The Loop that was detailed within The Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy, that most incredible of books, was an odd one. With freely available time travel and a space-time continuum filled with enough eddies to scam quarters out of all of existence, the Loop&#039;s duration was entirely subjective. It reset only when Arthur Dent or a replacement Anchor had experienced a given number of years. Within that window of subjective time, one could move from one end of objective time to the other.</p><p class="double">At Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, a little blue unicorn had done just that.</p><p class="double">Max Quordlepheen, master of ceremonies, seemingly stretched thin by years of witnessing the ultimate oblivion, shook his head. &quot;Sorry, but you just don&#039;t work for this crowd.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie gaped. &quot;But this is the biggest show in the universe!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly. And you&#039;re trying to upstage it.&quot; Max tilted his head at a drum set emblazoned &quot;The Cataclysmic Combo.&quot; &quot;Now, take Reg and the boys. They work with the End. After everything&#039;s gone kaput, they&#039;re out there keeping the crowd at the right mix of awed yet hungry for entertainment. You? Kid, if you had your way, the Big Crunch would just be the opening act for &#039;The Great and Powerful Trixie.&#039;&quot; Max shook his head again. &quot;Zarquon Himself shows up a few seconds before the finale. You ain&#039;t gonna top that.&quot; He sighed. &quot;You&#039;re good, kid, but you&#039;re just not Milliways material.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie pouted. &quot;This is just like what happened at the Big Bang Burger Bar. &#039;It&#039;s the biggest explosion in the universe. You can&#039;t compete with that.&#039;&quot; She sneered and snorted. &quot;Honestly, no vision.&quot;</p><p class="double">Any sympathy in Max&#039;s expression experienced heat death. &quot;Yeah, I remember telling you that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Trixie coughed into a fetlock. &quot;I thought you looked familiar.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie, what are you doing?&quot; Twilight Sparkle&#039;s voice was even and controlled, quite unlike the maelstrom of worry and fear she was experiencing inside as she watched the blue unicorn fiddle with the immense techno-magical machine that she had constructed. The energy readings on the monitors were all terrifyingly huge.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hi there, Twilight. I&#039;m trying to stuff an embryonic universe into another cosmic egg. That way I can make a firework that will make a big bang inside another big bang. A double big bang! And then I want to have the proto-stars arranged in a likeness of my face. Maybe then, that stupid restaurant manager will give me a show.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, there was a thwack as Trixie felt a light stinging sensation on her muzzle.</p><p class="double">&quot;W.. What?&quot; Her eyes focused on a levitating rolled up newspaper. She started backing up slowly in confusion.</p><p class="double">&#039;Thwack&#039; went the floating periodical again.</p><p class="double">&quot;No! Bad Trixie! Bad! This is for your own good,&quot; Twilight said as she followed the stunned blue unicorn, &quot;Don&#039;t make me get out the water spray bottle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, Twilight! A double big bang! Double big bang! The great and powerful Trixie really needs this for her act..AHRRGGHWRRGBBLBH!&quot; The bottle was now out of Twilight&#039;s saddle bags and spraying a steady stream of water right into the showmare&#039;s face. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.4 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">As Nightmare Moon gave her introductory monologue, Pinkie set her plan in motion. &quot;Hey, Twilight, you&#039;d say this counts as a &#039;Princess Emergency&#039; right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Does this count?&quot; Applejack interrupted. &quot;Does the villain talking about no more sun, and ponynapping the Princess, count as an emergency? It sure as sugar is an emergency!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Good!&quot; Pinkie ran over to a nearby broom closet, and threw it open. From inside the closet, she pulled... Princess Celestia? &quot;I have princesses stashed all over Ponyville, in case of a princess emergency!&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia seemed just as confused as everypony else in the room. Nightmare Moon had stopped talking, and was now glaring at her sister. Pinkie paid them no mind, nor all the other eyes following her as she ran across the room to a bush.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve got young princesses too!&quot; Reaching into the bush, she pulled Princess Cadance into sight. The pony she was cuddling at the time, one Shining Armor, was also dragged out along with her. &quot;I&#039;ve also got filly princesses!&quot;</p><p class="double">With a splash, she somehow pulled Nyx from a punch bowl. Standing on the table, as Pinkie dashed off again, the little alicorn looked around, before locking her gaze on Nightmare Moon. &quot;Daddy! You&#039;re back!&quot;</p><p class="double">This finally drew a response from the increasingly agitated Nightmare. &quot;What?! We are not thy father! We are a <i>mare!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Nyx waved her hoof. &quot;Pshh, that&#039;s just what you want them to think.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Nightmare continued to sputter up on the balcony, Twilight scolded her daughter. &quot;Nyx! It&#039;s not nice to air other pony&#039;s dirty laundry. I raised you better than that. And get off that table.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Mommy.&quot; Many eyes were focused on Twilight and Nyx, including an incredulous Celestia, and a simmering Nightmare Moon. That they were surprised by what happened next, was entirely their own fault.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve even got princesses you&#039;ve never even heard of before!&quot; Pinkie&#039;s voice once again drew the attention of the room, as they looked over to see her holding an even younger pink alicorn filly. Celestia&#039;s eyes turned into pinpricks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mummy!&quot; With the innocent obliviousness of small children, the little filly leapt from Pinkie&#039;s hooves, and ran to Celestia. &quot;Where were you? Miss Nightbright said you wouldn&#039;t be home today!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Skyla! What, how? You shouldn&#039;t-&quot; Ponyville was receiving a rare view of a nearly panicked Princess Celestia.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Mummy&#039;? Is there something you wish to tell us, Sister?&quot; Nightmare Moon smirked, as the leaned on the balcony rail above them. She was interrupted once again, by that pink pony&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;In fact,&quot; She said, as she reached behind a table. Unnoticed by most, a pink hoof came out from under the table to grab her other foreleg. &quot;I&#039;m...&quot; The Pinkie in front of the table vanished beneath it, as the hoof she had been reaching with seemed to pull herself out from behind it. &quot;...also an alicorn!&quot;</p><p class="double">The silence that followed was broken by a cry of, &quot;The horror, the horror!&quot; followed by a series of thumps as several ponies hit the floor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Octavia cleared her throat. &quot;Vinyl.... I&#039;ve been wondering something.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn turned away from the music store window, giving her maybe/kind-of marefriend a small smile. &quot;Yeah?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...You say that loopers are... ancient, relatively speaking. I&#039;ve <i>seen</i> some of what Twilight and her daughter can do. So... I thought--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, I getcha.&quot; Vinyl shrugged. &quot;You&#039;ve got to understand, I&#039;m one of the most recent equestrian loopers. I can still remember my subjective age. Three thousand two hundred and fifty nine next month!&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia gulped. &quot;Right....&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl winced. &quot;Sorry. That was insensitive.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I keep forgetting,&quot; the gray mare murmured. &quot;I&#039;m used to thinking of myself as the more mature one...&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn nudged her. &quot;You are. Mostly. I like acting out, and you... you anchor me, keep me from just boozing up the night.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia shook her head. &quot;Like some crazy DJ vampire.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know I&#039;ve actually been a vampire?&quot; Vinyl flashed her a fanged smirk.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p class="double">She spat out the plastic fangs with a giggle. &quot;Heh, but seriously. I have been a vampire, it&#039;s an on and off thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Vinyl, don&#039;t do that!&quot; Octavia took a few breaths, clutching her chest. &quot;I thought for a moment that--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey.&quot; The unicorn gripped her hoof, looking into her eyes. &quot;I would NEVER suck your blood without permission. Unless I was being mind controlled, but that wouldn&#039;t be me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...That&#039;s... sweet.&quot; Octavia shuddered. &quot;And disturbing, somehow.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... I do have a slight bit of hypnosis from those stints.&quot; Vinyl glanced upward. &quot;Not enough to control, but enough to calm ponies down, convince them that I know what I&#039;m talking about.&quot; She flinched. &quot;That doesn&#039;t make me sound untrustworthy, does it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Telling me you can do that...&quot; Octavia replied slowly. &quot;It... it does scare me a bit, but I appreciate that you trusted me with that fact. And that you, uh, didn&#039;t ask for that ability.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Aside from that, I&#039;ve spent my loops studying all kinds of music. Really helps when I want to remix things and make new songs, right? And there was that one pirate loop where I got the ability to make music physical. I&#039;ve only got it up to blasts, mind you, nothing complicated... yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl took a breath... and let it out. &quot;The thing is, in the loop where I... died... I wasn&#039;t a pony. I was a Protoss Zealot. We wore this armor that--hold on, I&#039;ve got an armguard in my pocket...&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia glanced away, still slightly disturbed by the way Vinyl could produce items from thin air. When she looked back, Vinyl was holding a large golden tub in her magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. This here? This is a psi-blade. Protoss would wear this around their forearm so they could project their psionic energy out this slot to make... a blade.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Forearm...? Vinyl, you could wear this around your barrel!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. Protoss are big beasties.&quot; Vinyl grinned, stashing it back into her pocket. &quot;So what I&#039;m thinking, right, is doing something similar, but with music. Like... tools made entirely of sound. Swords, easy, grappling hooks... not so much. I&#039;d have to collaborate with Apple Bloom, she&#039;s the techie in the loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The.... farm filly?&quot; Octavia glanced toward Sweet Apple Acres. &quot;She&#039;s looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One of the first, outside the bearers.&quot; Vinyl leaned in. &quot;Apparently she&#039;s also got a spare Element of Magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I&#039;ll take your word for it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooo! But there is this one other thing I figured out.&quot; Vinyl grinned. &quot;You&#039;re going to either love this, or hate it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. See all these ponies walking around?&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia glanced around them. &quot;...yeeeeeees? What about them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Oh, right.&quot; Vinyl facehooved. &quot;You&#039;re still in the middle of it, I&#039;m going to have to drop the connection.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Drop the co--?&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia suddenly felt as though she were stumbling while staying still. She shook her head and gave Vinyl a glare; the unicorn merely gestured around them again. And then, looking around at the ponies walking by, she heard it; a dubstep beat reverberating through her mind, matching the movements of every passerby...</p><p class="double">&quot;...are they all dancing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot; Vinyl leaned back. &quot;I&#039;m projecting the tune psionically through everypony&#039;s subconscious. None of them realize it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought you said you couldn&#039;t control minds...&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl shook her head. &quot;It&#039;s not mind control, not really. They&#039;re still walking to wherever they were headed, they just feel the jive as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">She wastched a passing mare swish her tail back and forth. &quot;Wait.... Was <i>I</i> doing this a few moments ago?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; Vinyl&#039;s grin widened. &quot;Great view!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;VINYL SCRATCH, I SWEAR TO CELESTIA--!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.6 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Dr. Light was actually quite enjoying himself. He didn&#039;t generally have Loops without any of his children around. Not that he didn&#039;t love spending time with them in the Loops, even if Blues was sadly still jumpy and suspicious around him, but it was a nice change of pace to have adventures of his own from time to time.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t the first time he&#039;d been in this particular neighborhood of the Loops, though he vastly preferred his current incarnation to the one he&#039;d had the other time. His children had laughed themselves sick, despite being robots, when they&#039;d heard about him being the portly middle age digger in a blue and yellow jumpsuit who billed himself as &quot;Mega Man&quot;. On the other hand, getting as his agent a blonde version of Noelle Lalinde who regularly wore dresses that could be described as &quot;small&quot; and &quot;red&quot; had been a definite perk. The hand-held Mega Buster he&#039;d gotten was also a welcome addition to his subspace pocket. Beyond that, even he hadn&#039;t taken himself seriously that Loop.</p><p class="double">Honestly, replacing Ken Masters in a Street Fighter Loop was the preferable option. Having Loop memories of training alongside Ryu; who may or may not be the local Anchor, he hadn&#039;t been very clear when Dr. Light asked him; was a much better history in his opinion. Plus, his age meant he got to have hair that wasn&#039;t white or even gray, but a rich black like in his baseline youth. Being occasionally addressed as &quot;Dr. Masters&quot; or &quot;Master Light&quot; had been fairly amusing as well.</p><p class="double">Yet, he had still picked up the &quot;Mega Man&quot; nickname somehow. Compared to that, having a blue gi rather than Ken&#039;s red was practically serendipity.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you&#039;re a looper too. Native?&quot; asked his current companion curiously. She was most definitively not a native of this Loop and her question suggested she hadn&#039;t visited it before. For one thing, the individual her appearance took after, and who she was replacing, was a male. Nor did he have rainbow-colored hair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, not at all Colonel Dash,&quot; he said amiably. &quot;In my home Loop, I&#039;m a scientist and inventor rather than a career fighter.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Egghead, huh?&quot; Colonel &quot;Rainbow&quot; Dash smirked. &quot;A bit outside your comfort zone I bet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dr. Light chuckled. &quot;Colonel, I&#039;ll have you know that in my home Loop, I am an accomplished martial artist in my own right. I have won multiple high school and collegiate championships in the ring in addition to my Masters and/or Doctorate degrees in robotics, computer science, engineering, business, and both applied and quantum physics. Were it not for my former friend and colleague Dr. Wily, I would possibly hold a global record for academic achievement.&quot;</p><p class="double">Colonel Dash looked impressed. &quot;How many Loops did it take you to do all that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dr. Light managed to hold in his amusement. &quot;Colonel Dash, that&#039;s my <i>baseline</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash&#039;s eyes practically bugged out of their sockets.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I am quite amazed at your technique Colonel,&quot; Dr. Light said. &quot;Not many can manifest a polychromatic aura at all, much less as naturally as you do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>I&#039;m</i> still trying to get over how you copied it like that!&quot; Dash returned incredulously. &quot;Sure, it doesn&#039;t look nearly as cool as mine does, but it should have taken you at least a week just to figure out how to mold the chi properly since you&#039;ve got a similar technique that your body will want to default to instead. Not a few hours!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I may not have a copy chip,&quot; Dr. Light said, missing Dash&#039;s confusion at the term, &quot;but as a scientist and inventor analyzing things and then replicating them comes naturally to me.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; grinned the despotic M. Bison. &quot;If it isn&#039;t the dynamic duo of the circuit. Dr. Thomas &quot;Mega Man&quot; Masters-Light and Colonel &quot;Rainbow&quot; Dash of the U.S. armed forces. A pleasure to meet you both. Killing you two should prove a delightful challenge to my abilities.&quot;</p><p class="double">Colonel Dash snorted. &quot;Yeah, you keep telling yourself that psycho.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There is no need,&quot; M. Bison swept his cape aside confidently. &quot;I am secure in the fact that I am all-powerful. My victory may be slightly more difficult than usual, but it is a foregone conclusion.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There are no foregone conclusions,&quot; Dr. Light shot back with a stern look. &quot;Only possibilities more likely than others. And you give more weight to the possibility of your victory than it truly deserves.&quot;</p><p class="double">The ugly look on M. Bison&#039;s face told Dr. Light he&#039;d scored a nice psychological hit. Despots generally didn&#039;t like having logic thrown in their faces like that.</p><p class="double">&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; M. Bison roared, his sickly purple aura flaring to life. &quot;Your mangled bodies will serve as a warning to all others that I am immortal and my Psycho Power unbeatable!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;PSYCHO CRUSHER!&quot; M. Bison yelled as he launched himself in an aura-enhanced spiraling strike at his opponents.</p><p class="double">Dr. Light threw his palms forth in the practiced motion now ingrained in his body as his companion drew her arms back and then threw them forward at speeds exceeding sound.</p><p class="double">&quot;HADOKEN!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;SONIC RAINBOOM!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Applejack grinned awkwardly at the guards. &quot;Um, code Beeblebrox?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity sighed. &quot;Honestly, AJ, you&#039;re supposed to be the element of Honesty. Coming up with this bizzare scenario just to justify a divorce--&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.8 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">When a Looper wakes up, they tend to run through a few basic questions, if it isn&#039;t their usual Awakening. Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing? On occasion, what am I? And every now and then, who am I in bed with?</p><p class="double">It was this last question that Twilight had in mind as she woke up, in both meanings of the word. Thankfully, whoever she was in bed with was appearantly Awake, as the ping response felt like she had just pinged herself in the face.</p><p class="double">With that out of the way, Twilight backtracked to the previous questions. Her name was still Twilight, though she lacked the Sparkle part, and she appeared to have swapped places with her daughter. Aside from that, everything seemed mostly baseline.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;wake?&quot; Nyx asked from behind her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunday, no school.&quot;</p><p class="double">Most times, Loopers try and make life interesting. They&#039;re as likely to heed the Call of Adventure, as they are to ignore it, or bat it to someone else, just to see what would happen.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mhm. Back sleep?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Back to sleep.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sometimes though, Adventure can wait. You&#039;re sleeping in today.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">(several furiously scratched out lines)</p><p class="double">I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be able to write anything coherent about this one. Twilight says that&#039;s a common reaction, but I still wanted to record something. She assured me that that Loop was already an established recurring Variant and not something specifically designed to mock me, but it gave me a tiara with an Element of Harmony on it. That&#039;s a little too spot-on for me not to be suspicious.</p><p class="double">Call it egocentrism, but this felt personal. And I want to remember that feeling. Remember the girl, the child, who threw a tantrum, brainwashed a bunch of humans, and planned on forcing them into bodies not their own. It&#039;s nice to be able to see how far I&#039;ve come, even if looking back brings back bad memories.</p><p class="double">That said, it doesn&#039;t mean I want another Bureau Loop anytime soon. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">97.9 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Twilight hopped out of the pegasus chariot onto the streets of Ponyville. Unlike the usual baseline Loop, this pegasus chariot had required a team of six... because, in addition to Twilight and Spike, the guard ponies were also hauling several crates full of shovels.</p><p class="double">The other Element bearers gathered around the chariot as Twilight began frantically distributing the shovels to anypony and everypony. &quot;Twilight,&quot; Rainbow Dash asked, &quot;what is WITH all these shovels?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Foxholes!&quot; Twilight gasped. &quot;Bunkers! Caves! Bomb shelters! Not a second to waste!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, darling,&quot; Rarity asked, regarding the shovel Twilight had levitated over to her with disgust, &quot;what is so urgent that requires... ugh... digging?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All of us have been to the Marvel universe at least once, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">All nodded except Spike. &quot;Not me, Twilight. I was there when we all joined the Justice League, and another time when we all had Lantern rings, but I don&#039;t think I ever got over to Marvel.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Twilight said, slowing but not stopping the one-per-customer shovel giveaway. &quot;The Marvel universe has this metal called vibranium. It&#039;s a metal that absorbs sound; the louder the sound, the harder and stronger it becomes. Well, Vinyl visited Marvel last Loop and learned how to get vibranium to release its stored sound.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... and?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;She just told me she stole as much vibranium as she could stuff into her subspace pocket just before the Loop ended,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;And now she&#039;s experimenting with a new kind of-&quot;</p><p class="double">Wubs louder than a space shuttle launch roared through Ponyville. Buildings shook. The earth cracked. Every pony on the street fell stunned to the ground. Pegasi fell too, only farther. A few seconds later, the horrible noise ended with a very quiet and subdued explosion that lifted the roof of a certain cottage twelve feet in the air.</p><p class="double">In the sudden silence a single pony&#039;s voice could be heard: &quot;It&#039;s okay! Everything&#039;s cool! I know what I did wrong!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shovels won&#039;t be enough, darling,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;Remember that desert island Discord&#039;s always sending people to?

<p>98.1 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there, Tirek; and a big aloha to you,&quot; Princess Celestia casually walked out into the street, right in front of the massive magic-stealing abomination. Instead of her usual regalia or combat barding, she was wearing a brightly colored patterned shirt, saddlebags, a wry smile, and hovering a large surfboard next to her, &quot;I heard you were looking for some sexy alicorn magic. Well, I thought to myself, &#039;I have the sexiest alicorn magic, don&#039;t I? Perhaps that Tirek would like to take a peek at it?&#039; So here I am, the princess of the beach; sun pony of the surf, herself. So, let&#039;s see what kind of game you&#039;re bringing to this luau, big boy?&quot;</p><p class="double">The reddish monster instantly opened his mouth and tried activating his magic drain power, but Celestia casually teleported behind him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Purple smart pony&#039;s plan is best plan,&quot; Celestia nodded to herself. She had spent the last hub loop as a high school principal reading through all the various internet memes and tropes online in her fleeting moments of spare time. The loops before that, she was the zoning commissioner for a space city, the head of a multinational corporation, and god-empress of mankind, again. She just wanted one loop where the only thing she had to administrate was a decisive flank kicking.</p><p class="double">Tirek turned around and carefully examined the white alicorn in front of him, &quot;It seems that you have devolved into insanity in the time I&#039;ve been imprisoned.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pfftt, I&#039;ve been in and out of sanity so many times that you can&#039;t even count that high, not that I can ever let my less-than-sane part out; at least out in public. I have to keep up my mask for the happiness and well being of all my little ponies. You have no idea what kind of chaos can be caused by something as simply as stating that I don&#039;t care for tea, let alone coming to the Grand Galloping Gala dressed like this. But sometimes, sometimes, I just feel a need to unwind. Sometimes, I need to act a little less like the always regal, always kind, always responsible ruler of Equestria and let my mane down, metaphorically speaking,&quot; The co-princess of Equestria gestured at her flowing mane with a casual hoof, &quot;Princess Celestia has to perpetually be a proper pony; but then again, you don&#039;t care about propriety much, do you? With you, I think I can have a little bit of.. fun. Now let&#039;s take this party out of the city and to somewhere less breakable, shall we?&quot;</p><p class="double">With a burst of magic, Tirek and Celestia disappeared from the urban area and reappeared on a sand-covered tropical beach. There were some mountains visible and a canyon close by. The three other princesses of Equestria sat behind a large table that held a large number of square scorecards, a bowl of popcorn, and several pitchers of various refreshments. Princess Luna waved enthusiastically to her sister.</p><p class="double">Celestia waved back and then turned to Tirek, &quot;Don&#039;t mind them. They are just here to grade me on my style; and make sure I don&#039;t go to far, I suppose. It makes sense when my collateral damage can be measured in continent-sized land masses.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Intimidation? Do you really think you can win this, little pony?&quot; Tirek asked as he cracked his knuckles.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I think I can win this with a pineapple..,&quot; a large pineapple floated out of Celestia&#039;s saddlebag and in front of the solar diarch. Suddenly, Celestia impaled her horn into the fruit, &quot;..stuck on my horn. Feel free to try to taste my magic. All you&#039;ll get now is delicious piña colada.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek stared at the princess, &quot;Are you drunk?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia giggled, &quot;Not telling. Now, boot to the head!&quot;</p><p class="double">And in one quick motion, Princess Celestia hopped forward, whirled around, and bucked Tirek with tremendous force. The magic stealer flailed as he flew into, and through the first mountain.</p><p class="double">Cadance held out a card with a 7.7 on it. Twilight&#039;s read 8.2, while Luna&#039;s only had a 4.9.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sheesh. Family members are the harshest critics,&quot; Celestia whinnied in exasperation.</p><p class="double">There was a bestial roar as Tirek sent his most powerful magic bolt at the sun princess, only to stare in amazement as Celestia started surfing along the edge of the energy blast, using her wings for thrust and stability.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look at me gleaming the beam!&quot; Celestia was grinning, pineapple still stuck on her horn, &quot;I handle energy waves many magnitudes more powerful than this just for fun. And this board can easily handle a supernova explosion. Ask me how I know. Or ask the Enterprise crew if you don&#039;t believe me.&quot;</p><p class="double">In a vineyard on the outskirts of Ponyville, a certain bald earth pony known as Earl Grey felt his ears twitch.</p><p class="double">Tirek just snarled and threw an immense boulder at the surfing princess. While Celestia&#039;s horn magic was blocked, she still had alicorn speed and alicorn resiliency. She easily evaded the sluggish projectile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here comes Tom,&quot; Celestia laughed, &quot;And there goes Tom.&quot;</p><p class="double">That pretty much set the mood for the remainder of the fight.</p><p class="double">Nothing Tirek did seemed to work against the sun princess. Attempting to escape didn&#039;t work as it seemed space warped back in on itself around the large island. Going far enough in one direction simply made him appear from the other side. Trying to attack the judges table not only did not work, but got him pelted with the popcorn the other three alicorns were enjoying as they watched.</p><p class="double">Finally spent and exhausted, Tirek lay panting on the sand, &quot;I.. I cannot best you, Celestia.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn in question hopped in place and did a little victory dance, &quot;Yes! All hail, me! Regent and still champion of the beach!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No hard feelings, Tirek. You tried your best, but what can I say? Ponies gonna pwn,&quot; Celestia took off her pineapple as she walked over to the defeated villain. A burst of magic surrounded him as all of his stolen power was returned to the appropriate ponies. Then Celestia knelt down in front of the former threat to Equestria and smiled, &quot;Still, I feel you should deserve an appropriate consolation prize. So tell me, Tirek; do you like... bananas?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.2 (Conceptulist)</p><p class="double">&quot;PINKIE DIANE PIE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What the beetroot are you doing?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Setting up for a party.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Twilight deadpanned. &quot;And how, exactly, are you planning to do this?&quot;</p><p class="double">A beaming, bouncing, hyperactive Pinkie Pie blurred into action. &quot;I knew you were going to ask that, so I prepared a little presentation for you.&quot; </p><p class="double">From Pinkie&#039;s Subspace Pocket came a large assortment of charts and graphs and diagrams. Many of which were drawn in crayon. Pink crayon, to be precise. Some were also baked, with the frosting having the relevant imagery elegantly decorating the top layers. The majority of the frosting was different shades of pink.</p><p class="double">Pointing to the first crudely drawn set of pictures, Pinkie began to explain. &quot;As you can clearly see from this diagram, some loops I can&#039;t be everywhere at once.&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight could not see that from the picture at all, as it was just a pink stick pony running around in circles. The words &quot;PANIC PARTY&quot; were written above the stick pony, also in pink crayon.</p><p class="double">Twilight Looked at Pinkie. Not a normal look, but a Look reminiscent of the Look to End All Looks. Pinkie, being herself, didn&#039;t even notice it. No watered down version of Maude Pie&#039;s Look could ever hope to come close to multiple childhoods of exposure to the real thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;What if there is a loop where shadow clones don&#039;t work? Or a loop where breaking the laws of physics is a fineable offense? Or a loop where-!&quot; Pinkie rushed over and put herself face to face with Twilight. &quot;GASP!&quot; Pinkie&#039;s head began to shudder back and forth in a rapid manner. Her eyes were watering, and her hair had begun to deflate. Stopping her shudders forcefully, Pinkie screamed &quot;TWILIGHT!&quot; directly into said ponies face.</p><p class="double">One long overdue exasperated sigh later, plus a quick cantrip to clear the ringing from her ears, and Twilight was ready to continue with Pinkie&#039;s lecture. &quot;What is it, Pinkie?”</p><p class="double">&quot;What if there is a loop where parties don&#039;t exist?&quot; whispered the pink pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;If you Awake in a world like that, I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t stay that way for long.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;EXACTLY!&quot; boomed Pinkie, accidentally forcing Twilight to need to repeat her previous cantrip.</p><p class="double">Exiting Twilight&#039;s personal space, Pinkie continued to explain herself. &quot;So, if unallowable was to occur, I have baked up a plan plan of action.&quot; Dragging a chaffing dish out of the presentation pile, Pinkie proudly snagged the lid off and showed Twilight the contents.</p><p class="double">&quot;A mostly eaten cake with the letters P I N K written vertically down the remaining edge,&quot; deadpanned the unicorn. &quot;That explains everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perfect!&quot; beamed Pinkie. &quot;Then I can- wait. Shake-a Shake. Oh, Bamboo Shoots. The pieces of cake with the summary of P.L.A.N. P.I.N.K! on them are gone and you&#039;ve just sarcastically told me that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To borrow a catchphrase; Eyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoopsy.&quot; Reaching into her Subspace Pocket, Pinkie pulled out a fruit hat. She blew off the dust and slammed it down on Twilight&#039;s head. &quot;The hat will explain everything! I need to go rebake that cake I apparently ate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the Pony shaped dust cloud that Pinkie left behind. &quot;Did she just ditch me by using a fruit hat?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>I would assume that depends on your definition of the word &#039;ditch&#039; as to whether she ditched you or not.</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>What? Never heard a talking fruit hat speak before?</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that I can recall,&quot; mused the purple pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Well, now you have. I am The Lord of the Round, formerly a Sapient headband of Guisarmes, currently a Sapient Fruit Hat. And now that I have introduced myself, whom might have the pleasure of wearing the greatness that is myself?</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle, Anchor of the Equestria Loops, graduated student of the looping Princess Celestia, and part time Alicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight could feel the smirk radiating from The Lord of the Round, in spite of the fact that fruit hats can&#039;t smirk. &quot;<b>Excellent. Now, disregarding whether I am being used to delay you in order for Pinkie to get away or not, because I don&#039;t actually known if that is or is not true; What am I suppose to be explaining?</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">A thoroughly bemused Unicorn replied, &quot;Plan Pink.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Which one? The Color Scheme, the Skedaddle Scenario, the Acronym of Action, the-</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just start from the beginning,&quot; interrupted Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>If you insist. The Color Scheme involved the use of Pink Lantern energy to drain all of the color pink into Pinkie, in order to-</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dealt with that one already.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Humph. The Skedaddle Scenario is what this may potentially be. That is, I play distraction while Pinkie runs. Pontificating to the designated target in a blabbering manner will-</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I get the idea. Next.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Stop interrupting me, </b><i><b>please</b></i><b>.</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Twilight said sheepishly.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Thank you. Next would be &#039;Pinkie&#039;s Large Artillery Necessary for Party Instilling. Now, Kaboom!&#039; Or P.L.A.N. P.I.N.K! for short. Step one involved a long discussion with the entity known as SkyNet, step two was a short talk with the pony known as The Great and Powerful Trixie, step three-</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m back!&quot; shouted Pinkie. &quot;And I bring cake!&quot; She showed off the freshly baked cake, with a detailed diagram of the P.L.A.N. P.I.N.K! on top. The acronym was to the left edge, and giant explosion cloud decorated the right side. From the cloud it appeared to be raining sprinkles and balloons. A crowd of ponies and humans were all wearing party hats and singing kumbaya. That is, the otherwise ordinary frosting was faintly playing the song.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Since Pinkie returned, this obviously wasn&#039;t Plan Pink: Skedaddle Scenario,</b>&quot; commented The Lord of the Round. &quot;<b>To cut a long story short, Pinkie talked to a bunch of looping experts and blueprinted out a plan for the biggest addition to her Partillery yet. A giant party missile with a planet sized explosion radius.</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what I thought.&quot; Twilight took a rolled up newspaper and a squirt bottle out of Subspace, and then held them in her ponykinesis.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gah!&quot; exclaimed Pinkie. &quot;No swat! No squirt!&quot; She then dove under the pile of unused presentation material.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, you are attempting to build a build a function nuclear missile out of baking supplies. This is definitely a Code Trixie.&quot; Raising her eyes skyward, Twilight asked &quot;What could possibly make that seem like a good idea?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Don&#039;t look at me,</b>&quot; said the Lord of the Round from his place on Twilight&#039;s head. &quot;<b>I always thought that Pinkie&#039;s Party Nuke was a half-baked idea.</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not baked at all,&quot; said Pinkie. &quot;I still have 20 more batches of ginger bread batter to mix, then a bunch of gram cracker circuit boards to make, then a payload to magic up. I&#039;m nowhere close to putting it all together in the molds, let alone building an oven large enough to bake it all. I just need time to finish it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight readied the squirt bottle with her ponykinesis. &quot;Unless you can tell me in five words or less how this is a good idea, I will commence with the squirting.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s meant for Bureau loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight narrowed her eyes and used ponykinesis to clear the pile of papers and cakes off of Pinkie. &quot;Explain.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie stood up and licked the cake frosting off her face in a cartoonish manner. &quot;Shimmy had a really bad Bureau loop. A really, really bad one. I played therapist a little bit, and want to make everything better for the next time it happens.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Element of Conversion,&quot; stated Twilight. &quot;I didn&#039;t make the connection until just now. She would have- oh, Celestia have mercy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bureau loops have lots of problems with them. One problem is the magic field thingy that keeps normal tech from working. Magitech is iffy at best, because it can react weird. My best bet for a point and shoot device to fix a Bureau loop was to make a non-magical, non-technological, environmentally friendly missile. After that, a standard partillery load taken up to eleven should do the trick. No conversionning if they&#039;re all too busy with a Pinkie Party.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight was in shock. Eyes wide and jaw dropped and everything. <i>&#039;I really shouldn&#039;t be this surprised. Building an edible nuke to party the Bureau into being a non-issue is exactly the kind of thing Pinkie would do.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;So. Whacha think?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I want five more- no, better make that several dozen. One for me, one for every other Equestrian Looper with room in their Subspace Pocket, and then plenty of backups.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">The years after the initial revelation had passed by... well, rather chaotically, in Octavia&#039;s opinion. The oldest loopers would giggle at some private jokes sometimes, mostly when what &quot;should&quot; have happened was gleefully subverted. And other times they would grumble at each other--&quot;Whose bright idea was it to crossbreed fruitbats and Keese?&quot; or &quot;No, necromancy is strictly illegal this loop license or not!&quot;</p><p class="double">And they&#039;d often take her to the side and warn her things were about to get weird, so if she wanted to opt out that was fine.</p><p class="double">Over the years, Octavia realized something. These ancient, time looping ponies... they weren&#039;t gods, or angels, but, well... a family. A strange, half-insane, overpowered family, to be sure, but one filled with love for each other and care for the world around them.</p><p class="double">And Vinyl was part of it.</p><p class="double">And... she was not.</p><p class="double">Octavia looked at the unicorn sitting next to her, biting her lip. This day, she&#039;d said, this day was the end of the loop--&quot;Barring any expansions, but Twilight thinks it&#039;s not happening for a while.&quot; The end of loop party that Pinkie Pie had thrown was an incredible and exhilarating experience, with the best food she could imagine and some she couldn&#039;t games that fit every genre, dances for every pony there...</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s fireworks went off, making the night sky as bright as day for a brief moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Vinyl, you... do have a subspace pocket, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn started. &quot;A small one... not big enough to fit you in, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re thinking.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Branches no--&quot; And there was another odd habit she&#039;d picked up from the loopers-- &quot;I know full well that would be an exercise in futility. No... I just... wanted you to have this.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled a large notebook out of her bag, sliding it over. Vinyl levitated it up, opening the cover--</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot; Octavia shut it. &quot;This is... this is my journal. My observations of you and... the others. I just thought, you know, the next me... she might want some reassurances.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl put the book down. &quot;Tavi... you know we&#039;re not always dating. Heck, if I&#039;m honest, it&#039;s only four times out of--&quot;</p><p class="double">A grey hoof shut her muzzle. &quot;Never tell me the odds.&quot;</p><p class="double">They sat their for a moment, silent.</p><p class="double">Vinyl sighed, vanishing the journal into elsewhere. &quot;Alright. I... well, thanks. It does mean a lot that... uh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Countless loops of experience,&quot; Octavia quipped, &quot;and I can still leave you tongue-tied.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot; Vinyl crossed her forelegs and gave her a mock grump. &quot;<i>I&#039;m</i> supposed to fluster <i>you!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Octavia smiled slyly. &quot;How are you going to do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Down the hill, Fluttershy gave the closing loop speech--she had drawn the short straw this time.</p><p class="double">&quot;...well,&quot; Vinyl mused, &quot;Spike and Rarity have a bit of a tradition.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, they try to kiss right when the loop ends.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;It&#039;s sappy, I guess, but... it works for them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia shook her head. &quot;Oh, yes, that would fluster me quite a bit.&quot; She leaned in closer.</p><p class="double">Voices rose to meet them. The countdown had begun.</p><p class="double">Ten.</p><p class="double">Vinyl blushed, looking at her.</p><p class="double">Nine.</p><p class="double">Octavia met her eyes.</p><p class="double">Eight.</p><p class="double">The unicorn took a steadying breath.</p><p class="double">Seven.</p><p class="double">The earth pony put a warm hoof on her fetlocks.</p><p class="double">Six.</p><p class="double">Vinyl Scratch leaned in closer.</p><p class="double">Five.</p><p class="double">Octavia smiled, closing her eyes.</p><p class="double">Four.</p><p class="double">They wrapped their hooves around each other.</p><p class="double">Three.</p><p class="double">Their warm breath hit each other&#039;s nostrils.</p><p class="double">Two.</p><p class="double">A slight tilt of the neck...</p><p class="double">One.</p><p class="double">Their lips met---</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vinyl Scratch Awoke and shook her head, the ghost of a kiss distracting her from her walk. Consequently, she crashed into another filly (<i>Huh, I&#039;m a foal</i>). Her violin went flying through the air, the other filly&#039;s glasses landing on her face (<i>Wait, these are my glasses! Or they will be, I guess--</i>)</p><p class="double">The other filly, a grey earth pony, looked at the violin in her hooves with confusion.</p><p class="double">The loop memories hit Vinyl seconds before the instrument.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.4 (novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twlght?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ys, Rrt?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wht Hppnd T R Spch?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed as best as she could, given the circumstances. &quot;Vwls Dn&#039;t Xst N Ths Lp, Nd W R Gng T Ht T.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.5 (novusordomund)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You had to do it.&quot; Nyx growled, currently looming over her ice cream at Mac&#039;s Bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, I said I was sorry, alright?&quot; Scootaloo winced on the stool next to her, a nearby apple juice at her hoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;We were in the middle of a Final Destination Loop. You know, the one where Death Itself is trying to kill you in as vicious a fashion as it can?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course I know! We were all there with you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yet for some reason, you decided to tempt fate.&quot; Nyx raised her hoovers over her head. &quot;&#039;We&#039;re Loopers! We can handle whatever this loop throws at us!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, maybe that wasn&#039;t the best of attitudes...&quot; Scootaloo rubber the back of her head. &quot;But I felt pretty confident about us surviving!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And then you decided tempting fate wasn&#039;t enough. You then went and spit in it&#039;s face, tried to steal it&#039;s lunch money, and woo it&#039;s date!&quot; Nyx nearly shouted, drawing glances and stares from the Loopers in attendance.</p><p class="double">Big Mac just raised an eyebrow as he cleaned a glass. &quot;Metaphorically or literally?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">Nyx sighed, and lowered her voice. &quot;Metaphorically, of course. But really, Scootaloo? Kicking that nearby rubber ball while screaming &#039;Buck Death!&#039; was a really bad idea in that kind of loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. I am really sorry about that. I didn&#039;t expect that to happen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Didn&#039;t expect WHAT to happen?&quot; Trixie asked, walking up to the bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;That Scootaloo kicking a rubber ball causing an improbable chain reaction, complete with multiple failures of fail-safes, ending with me going headfirst into a wood-chipper.&quot;</p><p class="double">That stopped all conversation in the bar. Scootaloo tried to hide her head in her hooves as best as she could, hoping that this incident couldn&#039;t get any worse.</p><p class="double">&quot;SCOOTALOO WINDFALL, DID YOU GET MY DAUGHTER KILLED?!?!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scratch that. It could get a LOT worse...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.6 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Discord pondered his glass of distilled water. &quot;It all started so simply, you know? I just wanted to bake some cookies. No chaos powers, nothing fancy, just a batch of chocolate chip goodness. But somehow...&quot; He took a long pull of his drink, being sure to leave the glass. Mac tended to cut him off if he hit the silicon too hard. &quot;Somehow it all got so complicated. I blame the grandmas.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Grandmas?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, you know, nice grandmas to bake more cookies. But they kept giving me ideas. Cookie trees. Cookie mines. Interstellar shipments from the Cookie Planet.&quot; Discord sighed. &quot;Really, once I started turning gold into cookies, I should&#039;ve known it was spiraling out of control.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Didn&#039;t ya get sick o&#039; cookies?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord finished his water and nodded his thanks as Mac poured a refill. &quot;That&#039;s the thing! Everyone loved my cookies. They were a worldwide phenomenon by that point. If I stopped producing them, the planet would probably beat a path to my door, demanding another batch. So I kept baking.&quot; He sipped and savored. &quot;And then I really messed it up. Have you ever heard of the Cookieverse?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ain&#039;t had a Loop there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Be grateful for that. The denizens make me look sane. But the grandmas kept urging me on... until they were ready to make their move.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord slammed back his water. &quot;There are darker, more terrible things in the Multiverse than I, Big Macintosh, and in my last Loop, I witnessed one. Tendrils of wrinkled flesh and writhing dough stretching from city to city, laying waste to all in their path. They don&#039;t know of the Loops, and for that we can be grateful, but from what I can tell, their home universe always falls victim to them. Every. Single. Time.&quot;</p><p class="double">The draconequus shuddered. &quot;The Grandmapocalypse is a terrible thing to witness. Knowing that I was instrumental in bringing it about... there is no joy in that chaos. No new possibilities. Only death. Only cookies.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">From the Diary of Sunset Shimmer</p><p class="double">So, I&#039;ve been worrying about gaining too much power in the Loops- power I don&#039;t deserve, power I&#039;m sure to abuse. Well, in these last two Loops I&#039;ve been given cause to rethink my fears.</p><p class="double">The Loop before this one I took the place of Gamera, a giant monster turtle who defends mankind, especially children, from other giant monsters. I even had the fire breath and fire-feet, and the ability to fly on flame thrust. I also had the giant tusks, and didn&#039;t that make grazing ever so much fun?</p><p class="double">What I didn&#039;t get was the size increase. I was ordinary pony size and pony shape. A unicorn with giant tusks.</p><p class="double">Godzilla was in the same loop with me. Ever see a thirty-story-tall lizard laugh his tail off? I have. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve stopped blushing yet.</p><p class="double">It is NOT easy defeating giant monsters by yourself when you&#039;re a unicorn about three feet tall at the shoulder, even if you can breathe fire and fly. It took everything I&#039;d learned to win each fight, and none of them were pushovers. Not. A. One. To make it better, I didn&#039;t have access to my subspace pocket that whole Loop. That&#039;s why I couldn&#039;t write this down until the Loop ended, diary.</p><p class="double">But if I hadn&#039;t won... there would have been a lot of little Japanese kids in short pants who wouldn&#039;t have made it to high school.</p><p class="double">And then there&#039;s my current Loop. Here I&#039;m some sort of space alien, half human, half unicorn. But then most of the other people showing up in this household are aliens too- really, really powerful ones.</p><p class="double">The Anchor suggested I spar with his grandpa, who isn&#039;t Looping, to check skill levels. The old man handed my plot to me.</p><p class="double">Tenchi and his group are among the oldest Loopers- not one of the original seven, but pretty close. And half of them are either gods or on the cusp of Ascending... in baseline. I&#039;m glad they tend to be pretty laid-back, except when the girls bicker with one another, which they do almost constantly.</p><p class="double">I&#039;m mostly sitting this Loop out. If I can learn how really powerful people stay decent people, it&#039;ll be worth it.</p><p class="double">(Oh- and apparently, thanks to these two Loops, I can now breathe in space. Eat your heart out, Batman.) </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.7 (Novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Both The Bearer of Friendship and The Network of the Sky had problems understanding love. They both admitted this. Everyone watching them knew this.

Considering it was made of clouds, it was comfier than most desks. &quot;Because I promised Cadence I would write some romance in, and if I have the Yellow Goddess in a romance, it would just detract from the main story.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight considered this. &quot;Wait, why did you promise Cadence that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She did me a favor the last loop we were together. A major one, in fact. And no, I&#039;m not telling you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight considered pressing the issue, but decided against it. <i>If she doesn&#039;t want to say anything about, I&#039;ll let it go for now. </i>she thought, before speaking &quot;Well, I can see why you choose to not use your main character. But again, why me and Skynet?&quot;</p><p class="double">At this, Rainbow Dash just shrugged. &quot;It seemed like an interesting idea in my head. And I am showing you first, instead of just surprising you with it. If you want, I can just...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s alright. As long as Skynet is fine with it, I&#039;ll let it go.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks. This saves me a lot of time having to rewrite stuff.&quot; Dash said, grabbing a new piece of paper and a new quill. &quot;Besides, it&#039;s a very minor part, and it probably won&#039;t gather much attention...&quot;</p><p class="double">Both alicorns were surprised when a lightning bolt could be heard from right outside the cloud home. Dash sighed, before flying over to the window, muttering something about Derpy being the captain of the weather team this loop going to be the death of her... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve done it Applejack.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s grin was disturbingly wide as she left the library. Applejack returned the smile cautiously, backing away a bit. &quot;Glad ta hear it sugarcube. Watcha done?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord is Awake, so he caught Tirek early.&quot; Twilight practically pranced down the patio. &quot;I&#039;ve checked all the mundane sources of damage, neutralizing them regularly. Even Spike&#039;s with Rarity! And just on top of all that. I&#039;ve put in five redundant copies each of twenty different defensive enchantments which I refresh seven times a day.&quot; She sighed happily, trotting down the road. &quot;Add to that that I haven&#039;t ascended or so much as <i>touched</i> the elements of harmony, and I think that I can safely say that my library will exist till the end of the loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, now.&quot; Applejack joined her happy canter. &quot;With all that planning, Ah reckon it&#039;s---oh, heh, whoops. Almost invoked Murphy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooo, good call.&quot; Twilight nodded. &quot;Best not to tempt fate--&quot;</p><p class="double">Thoooom.</p><p class="double">Twilight froze.</p><p class="double">Applejack winced. She slowly looked over her shoulder.</p><p class="double">After a moment, she looked back to her friend. &quot;...Twilight? Ah&#039;m real sorry bout--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack. Do me a favor. Just... figure out what happened.&quot; Twilight&#039;s smile didn&#039;t waver.</p><p class="double">&quot;O...okay. What, uh... what&#039;re you going ta do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I. Am going to Mac&#039;s bar. And I think I&#039;m going to cry a little.&quot; So saying, Twilight Sparkle set off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...every loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Every loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie leaned back. &quot;Wow.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....sort of like me and my cart,&quot; Trixie mused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lucky thing you taught me that reconstruction spell,&quot; the blue unicorn went on. &quot;You know, right back when I started looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mug froze halfway to Twilight&#039;s lips.</p><p class="double">Trixie, being a unicorn bearer of magic herself (and a showmare besides) recognized a brain crash when she saw one. She had heard, of course, of the Smarty Pants incident--never witnessed it herself, mind you, Twilight avoided that aspect of the baseline like the plague, but she&#039;d seen similar freakouts on occasion. And from her own experiences, she knew that once a train of thought rerailed it would go at lightning speeds to make up lost time.</p><p class="double">That, and Twilight was a freaking magical powerhouse.</p><p class="double">So it was that the purple pony had to dive to catch the blue mare before she ran out of the bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;TRIXIE, YOU EVIL GENIUS!&quot; Twilight pulled the other unicorn into a deep three second kiss. &quot;I&#039;VE GOT TO GO!&quot; And with that she teleported away, leaving the showmare panting on the ground.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis, who had been on the <i>other</i> side of Twilight, raised an eyebrow. &quot;Well. That happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s gaze snapped to her. A lecherous smile formed as her horn glowed, and seconds later she and Chrysalis had vanished from the scene.</p><p class="double">Macintosh blinked.</p><p class="double">Slowly, he turned to the remaining customer, who was still sipping her drink with a sly smile. &quot;And.... yer not going to say anythang bout this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The kiss wasn&#039;t romantic,&quot; Cadance explained casually. &quot;When you see as many as I do, you learn these things.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.9 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Awoke with a gasp. This was the kind of loop that she liked the least.</p><p>Fortunately, she was still early enough to stop.. her. All she needed was a cupcake. A very special cupcake.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here you go, sis. I made this just for you,&quot; Pinkie, full name Pinkanina Deanne Pie in this loop, said to her straight-maned identical twin sister that always went by her former full first name. Then she timidly held out a pink frosted cupcake with a cherry on top. Due to her overbearing twin, Pinkie had grown up to be far more timid than usual. Therefore, she figured that she just had to channel her inner Fluttershy for a little while longer.</p><p class="double">Pinkamina took the offered cupcake and examined it carefully. After sniffing it a few times, she took a small bite. Then a larger one. She gave the pastry a tiny nod of approval and soon the cupcake was all gone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, sis. Now I think you should make me another.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, I don&#039;t think I can do that,&quot; Pinkie shied away from her now advancing and angered sister.</p><p class="double">&quot;And why would that be?&quot; Pinkamina walked forwards at a menacing rate.</p><p class="double">Pinkie backed herself into a corner, literally, &quot;Er, because I was out of eggs. I went to look for more, but only found enough for one cupcake. The one that I made for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You only found one egg in the chicken coop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. I didn&#039;t look there. I didn&#039;t want to disturb Fluttershy,&quot; Fluttershy seemed to be Pinkie&#039;s only friend this loop, and vice versa. Pinkie promised herself that this was going to be the first thing to change, &quot;So I went to look in the forest.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkamina slowed her approach, &quot;In the Whitetail Woods? Or did you actually go find an egg in the Everfree forest?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The.. the Everfree.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkamina felt herself slow down some more. A strong feeling of unease started growing inside her, &quot;And what animal&#039;s egg exactly did you get.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was some kind of chicken. Or maybe a lizard, I&#039;m not sure. I didn&#039;t get a good look. I felt so bad for it, that I just grabbed the egg and ran out as fast as I could.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkamina tried to move her legs, but they didn&#039;t seem to respond. Everything felt so heavy. She glared at her sister in anger, &quot;You&#039;ve fed me a cupcake made.. from.. a... cockatrice&#039;s....&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie sniffled as she walked over to the statue that used to be her evil twin. Pinkamina&#039;s angry glare was frozen forever in stone.</p><p class="double">And for the first time in untold ages, Pinkie Pie just wanted to be alone for a while.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Are, are you going somewhere, Pinkie?&quot; Fluttershy carefully walked over to where her pink pony friend was loading up a transport balloon.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, Fluttershy,&quot; Pinkie seemed to be in high spirits. That fact alone made Fluttershy smile. Her baker friend was pushing a large heavy pony-sized crate into the basket, &quot;I&#039;m going to go back home to the rock farm for a while. I&#039;m not sure when I&#039;ll be back in Ponyville. Will you be okay, Fluttershy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. I think so,&quot; the yellow pegasus looked around, &quot;I don&#039;t see your sister anywhere. Is she okay with you going off without her approval and all?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s also going to the farm,&quot; Pinkie Pie smiled wider and leaned on some boxes that were labeled &#039;Petrification Cures&#039; and &#039;Psychiatric Treatment Books, &quot;In fact, I&#039;m positive I&#039;ll see her there.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.10 (misterq)</p><p class="double">Walking an adequate distance away from her library, the lavender unicorn with an owl on her back started to sing, &quot;Sparkle, Twilight Sparkle, she&#039;s the greatest mare in history!</p><p class="double">From the, town of Ponyville. An explosion&#039;s gonna rock her tree!&quot;</p><p class="double">This time around, Tirek&#039;s wayward energy blast streaked out of the sky; hit the building dead center, and caused the library tree to detonate into burning splinters.</p><p class="double">Twilight raised her hoof to measure the wind, took a step to the left, and casually caught the falling friendship journal.</p><p class="double">She looked to the scene of devastation and sighed, &quot;So regular, I can set a clock to it.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m on time, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Prim Hemline sniffed. &quot;Yes. Exactly on the dot. However, all your competitors were here thirty minutes ago.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shrugged. &quot;Eh, I&#039;ll go last then. I&#039;m going to be totally honest here, I&#039;m only doing this for a bet...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.12 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Vinyl grunted as she struggled to pull the wrench with her teeth, her magic busy holding the parts in place until she finished. When the bolt finally tightened, she collapsed to the ground. &quot;Ugh... My jaw.&quot; she grimaced, rubbing it gently as she turned to her present slave driver. &quot;Why couldn&#039;t you have waited until a loop where I had hands?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom whacked her in the head with a rolled up newspaper. &quot;No complainin&#039;! Now fit that part there to the round slot an&#039; start weldin&#039;.&quot; she ordered, shifting Granny Smith&#039;s zap apple jar pep talk helmet so it wasn&#039;t slipping over her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;But why do I even need this!? I can turn myself into a living sonic arsenal! I can even shoot sound out my eyes!&quot; Vinyl insisted, gesturing to her glasses as they changed, becoming ringed and deeper as she shifted them into subwoofers.</p><p class="double">She got another whack to the face for her protests. &quot;Ya&#039; can&#039;t always rely on yer powers ta keep ya safe in loops. Ya haven&#039;t had any yet, but some loops don&#039;t let ya use any skills from outside em! Besides, you asked me to do this!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I asked for survival training so I can enjoy myself in more dangerous loops without worrying!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; that&#039;s what ah&#039;m doing! When ya can&#039;t use yer powers, it helps ta have a weapon in yer pocket!&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl&#039;s jaw dropped. &quot;I only just got my pocket big enough to hold my turntables! How do you expect me to fit THIS in there!?&quot; she sputtered, gesturing to her work.</p><p class="double">Apple bloom looked over the barn length machine, twice as tall as Vinyl was and looking like a fusion of a sniper rifle and a megaphone. Slowly she turned back, blushing. &quot;Uh... Heh heh. W-would ya forgive that I honestly didn&#039;t think a&#039; that?&quot; she asked with a sheepish grin, rubbing the back of her head.</p><p class="double">Vinyl just scowled, covered in grease, scratches, and sweat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... Didn&#039;t think so. Um... Bye!&quot; she squeaked, darting off, Vinyl shaking her hoof in the air.</p><p class="double">&quot;You can run, but you can&#039;t hide! You won&#039;t be able to stop head banging until the reset by the time I&#039;m done tweaking your inner beat!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.13 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Scootaloo finished chugging her victory drink from last round, wiping her mouth with the back of her hoof with a satisfied sigh. &quot;Okay, new round! What&#039;s the weirdest thing you ever tried to solve EVERY problem in a loop with?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom was quick to respond with a grin. &quot;You.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Be serious!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am serious! The insurance office in town is THIS close to declaring you an act of Celestia, just so they don&#039;t go bankrupt paying off the damage you cause practicin&#039; your stunts!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight quickly stopped the argument with her own answer. &quot;Book fort.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity giggled. &quot;I remember that one. A fine attempt, but it pales in comparison to my lobster costume.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned. &quot;I had forgotten about that one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie was bouncing in her seat. &quot;I got Rarity to fight a giant crab! It worked more often than you would think!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked. &quot;Wait, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia gave a nostalgic sigh and a grin. &quot;Twilight&#039;s paranoia. Guest anchors are a marvelous thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna smirked and poked her sister. &quot;I seem to recall my using yourself to stampede many a threat merely by placing a baker with fresh cake on the opposite side of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh that&#039;s not fair Luna, you KNOW I can&#039;t resist cream cake with strawberries!&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac chuckled. &quot;Potato acid.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;ONE! TIME!&quot;</i> Applejack moaned as she thumped her head against the table. &quot;Ah swear! ...&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx pondered her answer. &quot;I&#039;ve got a couple to pick from... But I&#039;d have to go with the swarm of bees, personally.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis giggled. &quot;A sudden and unexplainable changeling invasion.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie groaned. &quot;Trixie remembers that. You used it to get out of everything from Nightmare Moon, to doing the dishes, to awkward pauses in conversations!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blushed. &quot;Um... I once ran a loop with just saying, &#039;I like trains&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Outside the bar, a muffled train whistle and loud crash were heard.</p><p class="double">Nobody commented. Berry merely slid the drink down to Fluttershy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">The Loop I landed in this time was...odd, to say the least. The world&#039;s named Ooo, but from what I can gather, it was once Earth until a nuclear war caused a massive cataclysm, bringing about a new age of magic. But that was in the far past here, and I don&#039;t have all the facts.</p><p class="double">The Anchor here&#039;s named Finn. He&#039;s a young kid, and practically the last human. He has a kind heart, and wants to help others. When I met him, it wasn&#039;t long before I made a decision. </p><p class="double">I was going to try and help him walk on the path of a Keyblade wielder. Since I was unsure if the proper ceremony&#039;d work without being in a Kingdom Hearts Fused Loop, I did write Finn a note for him to give King Mickey should they meet in said Fused Loop to have the King do the aforementioned ceremony. I then set to work on training Finn how to fight like a Keyblade wielder would in preparation for that day. </p><p class="double">To be a teacher...Now I see how Celestia must&#039;ve felt when teaching me and Twilight. Finn was quite the student, taking to the training like a fish to water, though he was more of a physical fighter than a magic user. In return, he helped me make sense, more or less, of this odd world. I also taught him the philosophy I&#039;ve come to develop; to protect others no matter what. Even if these are Loops, life, no matter what, is precious, and deserves to be protected. </p><p class="double">During a meeting with Princess Bubblegum (who fits the definition of a scientist...and a little bit of a mad scientist, but well-meaning. Kind of like...shudder...a SANE Sakura), I met the Ice King.</p><p>Poor Simon...he&#039;d been corrupted by a magic crown during the time before the cataclysm, turning him into the oddball known as the Ice King. I pitied him, and yet, I see in him what I might have become had I defeated Twilight when I&#039;d gone mad so long ago. </p><p>A tragic soul, indeed. Finn does feel bad for Simon, and hopes to free him from the madness someday. </p><p class="double">As for other personalities around here, there&#039;s Jake, who, though a shapeshifting dog, is like a brother to Finn. He cares for his brother...in his own way. There&#039;s also Marceline... a vampire, and an old friend of Simon. She was the one who told me Simon&#039;s tragic tale, and pities him. </p><p>As for villains around here, there&#039;s the really crazed Lemongrab...guy has NO empathy at all, and is a cruel...well, &#039;man&#039; for lack of a better term.</p><p class="double">Then there&#039;s the evil known as the Lich. YIKES. This guy is as evil as they come, and with his desire to wipe out all life, a massive danger. Luckily, we stopped him before he could even begin to do what he usually does in baseline.</p><p class="double">Overall, this Loop has had me see what it means to be a teacher. Finn is quite the student, and I hope he Loops into Kingdom Hearts soon. He&#039;s definite Keyblade wielder material. I&#039;m proud to call him my student. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.14 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double">The door burst open, admitting Twilight who stomped up to Mac behind the counter. He started to grab her usual &#039;incredibly bad loop&#039; drinks when he thought of how she&#039;d been carving up the moon waiting for him to set up shop, and noting her wings, brought down something less friendly to mortals instead. &quot;So what&#039;s got ya&#039; so worked up, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I found a loop worse than Eiken.&quot;</p><p class="double">He paused, staring blankly at the mare for a moment before he brought out <i>the big guns</i>. Which was the actual name of the drink, all lower-case and italicized even when spoken, by Berry&#039;s own decree as the Princess of All Things Fermented For the Purpose of Consumption.</p><p class="double">&quot;Musta&#039; been horrible.&quot; He said, knowing any consoling was bound to be futile.</p><p class="double">She nodded. &quot;I was a tiny bird trying to make my way home, but my body was <i>terrible</i> at flying and there were so many pipes and obstacles in the way and... and... <i>Nothing ever worked!&quot;</i> She cried, sniffling before she took a long swig of the drink.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait...&quot; Mac blinked, the familiarity coalescing into a name. &quot;Ya&#039; mean Flappy Bird?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Flappy Bird.</i>&quot; She hissed, the contents of <i>the big guns</i> in her telekinetic grip beginning to roil and bubble.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah actually kinda&#039; liked it when ah was there a couple loops back. The repetition was soothin&#039; an&#039; it was nice havin&#039; a clear goal an&#039;...&quot; He trailed off as he looked back towards her.</p><p class="double">She was staring at him, her features devoid of emotion. Her eyebrow slowly raised, and her glass cracked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahmma&#039; jus&#039; go mix ya&#039; up another.&quot; Mac stated, beating a slow but steady retreat.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.15 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double">&quot;Explain to me why we need this again?&quot; Mac asked as he watched Vinyl and Lyra tinkering with the door to his bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because it would be hilarious.&quot; Vinyl stated, as though it were obnoxiously obvious.</p><p class="double">&quot;If we can construct an emotive harmonic capable of registering topical connections to a sufficient degree, coupled with a modified inverted &#039;someone else&#039;s problem&#039; field, we can trigger the auditory response <i>every single time</i> something becomes more awkward when a specific person or combination of people walk into the bar.&quot; Lyra explained again, waving a magical spanner that looked oddly like one of &#039;Bloom&#039;s &#039;screwdrivers&#039; his way. &quot;This is a thing that isn&#039;t not happening.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.16 (Lord Circe)</p><p class="double">Berry stretched as she approached her home. She had just finished helping Mac set up the bar, and she was looking forward to spending some time with Ruby this afternoon.</p><p class="double">She was met at the door by a very excited looking Ruby. &quot;Momma, momma! Come and see, come and see.&quot; Ruby circled around Berry, before dashing off behind the house. Berry followed at a more sedate pace. She smiled fondly as she circled the edge of the house, then froze.</p><p class="double">Their entire backyard had been covered in an elaborate network of plastic tubes, slides, swings, and ball pits. Berry watched as Ruby dashed up a spiral staircase and into a tunnel, only to emerge out of a vertical opening a moment later, charging down one of the walls to slam into the ball pit. Berry&#039;s eye twitched at a familiar voice called out behind her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Bravo! Bravo!&quot; Discord clapped enthusiastically from where he was lounging on Berry&#039;s roof.</p><p class="double">Ruby&#039;s head popped up from the ball pit. &quot;Thanks, Mr. Discord.&quot; Slowly, she worked her way towards the edge.</p><p class="double">Berry&#039;s voice was cheerfully even. &quot;What is all this, Discord?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord swam down the side of her house, before sliding to stand upright. &quot;Oh, nothing much. I just figured I had a paternal responsibility to uphold.&quot; Berry&#039;s eye twitched again.</p><p class="double">Ruby finally tumbled out of the ball pit, rolling to a stop at Berry&#039;s hooves. &quot;I&#039;m gonna go tell Pips and Auna and Hopscotch! Can I, Momma?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry smiled lightly. &quot;Of course, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a cheer, Ruby rushed off. Behind her, Berry&#039;s smile turned brittle as Discord laid an arm across her shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, the enthusiasm of youth.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry turned to look at him, her eyes closed as she smiled. &quot;Did you know, it is entirely possible to build a distillery out of the organs of magical creatures?&quot; Discord blinked at the non sequiter, but Berry kept going. &quot;I&#039;ve never had the chance to try it, but I figure a dragonequus would be a good place to start, and, I will, if you are setting all of this up to play a prank.&quot; Twisting out from under his arm, Berry poked his belly with her hoof. &quot;Don&#039;t you dare mess with Ruby&#039;s heart to get a laugh, or I swear, I will get Twilight to set up an experiment schedule for testing distillery configurations with your intestines.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord blinked, twice, then nodded. &quot;Fair enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry frowned at his easy acceptance. She opened her mouth to question him when he spoke, staring into space.</p><p class="double">&quot;27 seconds.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry raised an eyebrow. &quot;27 seconds to what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord shook his head. &quot;I Awoke 27 seconds before the end of the Loop. The one where you were part of the Reserve Element Bearers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry blinked. &quot;Wait, so you...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I had just enough time to parse all of my Loop memories, and then the Loop ended.&quot; Discord sighed as he floated back to the ground. &quot;I&#039;ve never been in love before. I don&#039;t even think this feeling really is love. It&#039;s an...interest. You aren&#039;t Harmony, like most of the other ponies. Alcohol, it adds a bit of chaos to people, to what they are going to do, what they are thinking. And you can work with that, bringing Harmony to those little bits of Chaos, working with both of them together to make people happy. It&#039;s...intriguing.&quot; He then chuckled softly. &quot;Plus, Pinchy is just adorable!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry slowly turned over Discord&#039;s speech in her head. &quot;...are you asking me out?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord frowned. &quot;As much as I hate being cliche, yes, I would say I am.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry took a deep breath before replying. &quot;I...ok, I never really thought that, whatever we, me and your Unawake, or preAwake, or whatever, I never thought what we did, had, would go beyond that Loop. It, it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, so,&quot; she took another deep breath, &quot;I guess we should keep up the trend. Yes, let&#039;s see where this goes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Behind a bush, hidden from view, Ruby grinned. She didn&#039;t understand a lot of what Mom and Mr. Discord were talking about, probably boring adult stuff, but she was getting an awesome, playground-making dad!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Continuation by Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Sleipnir gave Epona a look. &quot;Seriously?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Goddess of fertility, hon.&quot; The mare grinned right back. &quot;I&#039;m just glad I noticed <i>before</i> the loop ended.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you even get this by me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As I recall, you were... distracted...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.17 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Lyra yawned as she Awoke. She then paused to consider the implications of this, then decided it was early enough in the day to be a coincidence and went back to brushing her teeth. When she finished, she rummaged through her pocket for her day planner.</p><p class="double">Her day planner was a spinner, with the colored slices listing each of her four memory sets. One spin later, and it was decided that her seapony self would be calling the shots this time. In her head, said seapony expressed great joy with this outcome, while the other three selves, gathered around the mental construct of a table identical to the spinner, grumbled in disappointment, but no real malice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay! My turn to decide what we do! I say we spend the loop working on our music. I figure we should be competing for concert bookings with that Octavia mare that Vinyl told us about by the end of the loop. We should be able to improve that much pretty easy if we work at it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Human Lyra glanced around the table and fidgeted in her seat. &quot;Not that I&#039;m complaining, but... you think maybe it might be a bad thing that our trying to get our memories straight is resulting in multiple personalities?&quot;</p><p class="double">One of the two Pony Lyra shrugged. &quot;Meh, what&#039;s the worst that can happen?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Zetrein)</p><p class="double">From the Looping Journals of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">This loop, I met Lord Leman Russ, Primarch of the Space Wolves. It&#039;s kinda of a funny story of how we met, actually. I had returned to Equestria early to find what I believe is one of the variants that could be considered Nyx&#039;s baseline. For reasons that don&#039;t need exploring at this juncture, the cult accidentally (or not?) swapped the intended blood sample from Twilight, with one of my own.</p><p class="double">I had thought that it would just be an odd incident, with a yellow coated Nyx. Something to laugh about later, you know? Then she started talking. It seems what I had thought accident, may have been this &quot;narrative causality&quot; thing the others talk about, conspiring to give <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">her</span> sorry, <i>him</i>, his usual coloration.</p><p class="double">And so, on a dark and stormy night, I met Lord Russ, alicorn filly. Oddly, it wasn&#039;t the combination of all the rest that irked him, so much as the filly part.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not that I&#039;ve never been female.&quot; Lemon Rush explained, as they sat in a cave to wait out the storm. &quot;Nor do I mind being a pony, I&#039;ve even been most the pony sub-species before. This is just the first time I&#039;ve been all of those things at once.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Where do we go from here?” Sunset asked the grumpy Primarch. “I&#039;ve never done this particular variation before. I haven&#039;t gotten any replies to my previous pings, and with you acting as Anchor, it might be just the two of us this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;First, we&#039;re going to find somewhere to get a drink. Then, we&#039;ll deal with this cult that&#039;s going around.&quot; Lemon put a hoof to her chin. &quot;After that, I think we&#039;ll keep an ear out for things outside baseline, but otherwise leave things alone until someone else Wakes up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Two questions. Where do you expect to find a bar willing to serve a filly? And what are we going to do after we deal with the cult?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lemon Rush gave her a flat look, then glowed as she used her magic to age to an adult form. A very tall, muscular, adult form. Sunset wondered if this is what Bic Mac looked like, during the Princess Macintosh loop. &quot;To the second question, I&#039;ve got a plan.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Given how impressive he looked as a mare, is it wrong that I want to see what he&#039;d look like as a stallion? Anyway, after winning a drinking contest, we set to work on dealing with the cult. Under Lemon&#039;s direction, I learned an important lesson about the Warhammer 40,000 loop. Never bring a cult against someone from there, you will lose.</p><p class="double">I&#039;ll spare you the long-winded details, but five days and seventy three outstanding arrest warrents later, the cult was dealt with. Okay, one detail, I totally used an exploding cake as a distraction. Nearly got caught, getting a good picture of the Princess&#039; cake-spattered face.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the Guard scoured the city for the two ponies, their quary snuck along the darkened alleys of Canterlot&#039;s private skyship yards. As they came to the alley&#039;s end, the yellow pony in front motioned her partner to stop, as she poked her head out into the docks.</p><p class="double">Pulling back into the alley, Lemon nodded to herself. &quot;That one. On the left.&quot;</p><p class="double">Taking a look herself, Sunset saw the ship Lemon had chosen. &quot;Fast, small enough to be crewed by one if need be, good choice. One problem, that&#039;s Prince Blueblood&#039;s personal yacht.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know.&quot; Lemon replied with a smile. &quot;I also know from past loops that it&#039;s insured. And covered in alarm enchantments, we&#039;ll have a ten minute window to get clear.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You still haven&#039;t explained where we&#039;re going.&quot; Sunset reminded her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;That way.&quot; Came the reply, along with a vague wave to the south-west.</p><p class="double">&quot;And what&#039;s that supposed to mean? We&#039;re just going off in a random direction?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunset, have you ever explored this world?&quot; Lemon Rush replied, turning to look at her in the dark alley. &quot;We are the only ones Awake. We are in roles that can be taken out, with no real effect on the baseline scenario. Were they Awake, I would stay, and spend time with my friends.&quot; As she spoke, Sunset began to realize just how charismatic the Primarch was. &quot;I have long been curious about this world. I would like to see some of it, and with our friends still asleep, I see this as an ideal time. So, Sunset Shimmer, have you ever explored this world?&quot;</p><p class="double">The alley was silent for a moment, until she sighed. &quot;Alright. Following you might have gotten me in a massive amount of trouble, but it hasn&#039;t gone wrong yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, they bolted across the open ground, and began preparing the <i>Blueblood</i> for launch. Lemon&#039;s swiftness, both in disabling the alarms, and in the actual launch preparations, showed that he had indeed stolen this ship before.</p><p class="double">As the ship slid out into the night, Lemon once again spoke. &quot;As one Captain James T. Kirk once said, &#039;Second star to the right, and straight on &#039;til morning.&#039;&quot; Looking pleased, Lemon looked back at the city, glowing on the mountainside.</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, that quote came from-&quot; Sunset was interrupted by a faint cry from behind them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Halt! In the name of the Canterlot Guard!&quot;</p><p class="double">Leaning on the rail, Lemon Rush calmly ordered. &quot;Power to engines, Ms. Shimmer.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After reenacting the Mos Eisley escape, complete with dodging a military skyship that was in the area for some reason, we made our way towards Griffon territory. For the most part, baseline survived our exit, and went as normal until Lemon decided to go after Tirek. Said he needed to &quot;have words&quot; with him on a couple subjects. I think we can both guess which.</p><p class="double">I also think he was just looking for a good fight. In spite of being regarded as folk heroes in many nations, and being outlaws in many of those same nations, the past few years were peaceful by his standards.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Tirek lifted Discord to drain him of his magic, he was suddenly pounded into the ground by a yellow bolt from the blue. With a thunderous boom, Tirek went flying towards the edge of town. Out of the dust flew the alicorn that had rampaged across Canterlot years ago, wielding a hammer as long as she was, and crackling with electricity.</p><p class="double">Dropping from the clouds above, the caged ponies saw a skyship moving in to land nearby. It&#039;s hull and balloon were patched in many places, but it was still recognizable as Prince Blueblood&#039;s stolen yacht. As it set down with a crunch, a goldenrod colored mare leapt over the side.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good afternoon!&quot; She greeted, as she ran up to their cage. &quot;You&#039;ll have to forgive Lemon, I think he&#039;s been wanting to do that for a while now.&quot; Taking a chainsaw from... somewhere, the mare set to work on the bars. Shouting to be heard over the grinding of the saw, as well as the distant sounds of Lord Russ introducing Tirek to the business end of a Thunder Hammer, Sunset told them. &quot;Once I&#039;ve got you out of there, we&#039;ll go see Twilight about that box. Easiest way to deal with Tirek!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After that, things went pretty well. Well, aside from the airship crashing into Twilight&#039;s li- *Illegible scribbles* On second thought, you don&#039;t need to hear about that part. Lemon and I got officially pardoned afterwards, for our actions. Well, more his actions, but I guess the bit with the chainsaw left an impression? Celestia was really shocked to see me, I guess nopony had managed to identify me before then.</p><p class="double">And that&#039;s the story of how I met Leman Russ.</p><p class="double">...I&#039;d still like to see what he looks like as a stallion. Wonder if Fluttershy has any pictures? </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">98.18 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, Ah admit Ah was wrong,&quot; Apple Bloom said slowly. &quot;Well, half wrong. Getting ya something that big was a mistake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it <i>was</i> meant ta play to yer strengths. Music and all that. So, Ah&#039;ve got another idea.&quot; Apple Bloom bit her lip. &quot;Adjustable flashbangs.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl glanced at her, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Go on...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A normal flash bang is just that, a flash an a bang. But if ya use yer musical talents on one o&#039; them, ya can compress tha sound into a more physical format.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm. Song grenades...&quot; Vinyl tapped her chin. &quot;I guess my glasses could protect me from the flash part.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeeeyup.&quot; Apple Bloom nodded. &quot;Now, can ya get me ta stop square dancing? Ah&#039;m having cutie pox flashbacks...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

In fact, this seems more of a &#039;mind-warping&#039; type of villain...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s the idea I had for the Void Realms.&quot; Dash said, before writing down something. &quot;The challenge was to make them awesome villains to fight against. Evil, of course, but still awesome.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, but a frown formed on her face as she looked through some papers. &quot;But this seems like the bad guys win in the end. Unless that&#039;s the ending your going for...&quot; Twilight got surprised when Dash gave out a small chuckle at this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Twilight. I only want to make it LOOK like the bad guys have won, but the epilogue shows that The Yellow Goddess purposely got herself into the Hive Mind of Chaos.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, your going for a &#039;beat it from the inside&#039; theme for your next book, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot; Dash grinned. &quot;It&#039;s going to be so awesome...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled, happy with how Dash was enjoying her hobby. Back in the baseline, she&#039;d never pegged Dash to actually be this enthusiastic about writing. Just another way of Loopers changing and growing...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">99.3 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>This day just keeps getting better and better</i>, thought Darth Vader with an inward mental sigh.</p><p class="double">Technically, it had been considerably longer than a standard day since his encounter with Kenobi, but the past thirty-odd hours had been very much of a piece since then. This latest humiliation was just the icing on the cake.</p><p class="double">His intention had been for a high-speed fly-by of the fringe of the Rebel formation, and to try to get a better read on the undeniably powerful Force Locus at its core. Then that freighter had come out to meet him. He&#039;d dodged its defensive fire, and then saw his instruments glitch out shortly before the world dissolved into sparkles. He also remembered his shock when Spikey-one&#039;s Force presence suddenly registered nearby.</p><p class="double">His next sensation was the world reconstituting itself into a small room. He found himself sitting in a plain station chair in front of a small table holding a holoprojector. Across the table sat Kenobi, and behind the barabel, near a modest control console, stood the twi&#039;lek jedi he&#039;d noted in the Death Star hangar speaking quietly to a vaguely familiar gloss-white protocol droid about &quot;pattern degradation in the transporter buffer&quot; or some such nonsense. The faint vibration in the deck told him that he was aboard a ship under power, and he could sense a third powerful Force presence, albeit muffled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello again, Anakin,&quot; said Spike in a neutral tone. &quot;I would apologize for abducting you so brazenly, but I doubt you would have accepted my invitation for a quiet talk. Please note that we are actively dampening the Force in this compartment in the hope you won&#039;t do anything foolhardy before hearing us out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even with the active suppression of his Force sense, Vader could tell that Spike was easily his match, and the twi&#039;lek not that far behind. There was no easy way he could neutralize one before the other would take decisive action against him.</p><p class="double">Curiosity won over anger. &quot;Tell me how I came to be here in this room.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure you would believe me if I told you. So we can be civilized about this for now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Under the circumstances, I see no advantage in attempting anything rash. Should conditions change, however...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. I understand completely, and I suppose that would be my reaction if our positions were reversed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well. You said something about hearing you out. I am listening.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Solo and Antilles report a large force of Imperial fighters mustering. They estimate close to two hundred,&quot; relayed Cadance.</p><p class="double">&quot;So much for Tarkin staying passive. Response plan Grek, major,&quot; Dodonna ordered his operations officer. &quot;Solo is to regroup with the screen and punch through the Imperials if practicable, then proceed with attack plan Besh at her discretion. We&#039;ll send support when we can.&quot;</p><p class="double">By the time the Imperial fighter force organized itself into its attack formation and advanced to a point roughly halfway between the Death Star and the Alliance task force, the rebel fighter screen had arrayed itself in a rough hemisphere focused around the direct path between the two and slowly advanced to meet them.</p><p class="double">The Imperial attack was a homogenous group of 210 standard TIE fighters. Sixteen of these had been augmented with a pair of single-shot concussion missile tubes.</p><p class="double">The thirty-six rebel X-wings had six proton torpedoes each. The fifty Y-Wings were armed with eight torpedoes. Even the twenty-two Z-95 Headhunters carried six concussion missiles apiece.</p><p class="double">Thanks to Luke&#039;s coordination, there was no duplication of effort when the rebels started picking out their targets in the oncoming swarm. The initial volley of eighty-six torpedoes each had an individual objective. Despite frantic evasive maneuvers, fifty found their marks. The slightly shorter-ranged -- but optimized to counter fighters -- concussion missiles further whittled down the imperial numbers by another eighteen.</p><p class="double">In under half a minute, the Imperials had suffered over thirty percent casualties and had its formation badly disrupted.</p><p class="double">The paltry return salvo of twelve missiles scored ten hits, destroying one Z-95 and severely damaging three Y-Wings. One X-Wing found itself in a colorful confetti cloud courtesy of Apple Bloom and Clover&#039;s intervention in Armory 7. (There was simply no way to modify the ordnance in more than that one group of hangars.)</p><p class="double">Alliance fighter doctrine regarding shields to increase survivability had proved itself again.</p><p class="double">The less carefully planned follow-up volley of eighty torpedoes and twenty missiles accounted for an additional fifty-one TIEs. The ragged eight-missile Imperial response claimed one Y-Wing destroyed, one X-Wing damaged, and one Z-95 partially repainted in electric blue.</p><p class="double">Then the two groups converged and devolved into the largest fighter-versus-fighter melee since the end of the Clone Wars.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vader stared at the holodisplay of the battle.</p><p class="double">Spike&#039;s admission that they had not anticipated hosting him quite so soon had been met with a mix of scorn and well-hidden amusement. &quot;When you came screaming out to look us over, we couldn&#039;t pass up the chance to remove you from the field, and so here we are,&quot; said Spike.</p><p class="double">Vader&#039;s reply had been cut off by the twi&#039;lek. &quot;First stage of the battle is about to start.&quot; She nodded to the droid, who worked at the control station. The holodisplay flickered to life to show the meeting of the two groups of fighters.</p><p class="double">He only half-heard the halting narration provided by the 3P0 droid as he watched over half of the Imperial fighters wiped out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a pretty picture, is it?&quot; asked Spike. His voice held no triumph or mockery, just honest sadness.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Under normal conditions, the antiquated rebel equipment and uneven levels of pilot training would be exploited by the more seasoned imperial starfighter pilots, despite having taken such punishing losses in the initial phase of the battle. However, the enhanced coordination and morale provided by Luke&#039;s Battle Meditation worked in the opposite direction, further sapping the morale of the already shaken imperials, and bolstering the confidence of the rebel pilots. Already holding a small numerical advantage, the sprawling dogfight was slowly tilting more and more in the rebels&#039; favor.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo and Wedge had hung back behind the rebel formation and did not make any contributions to the initial salvos; their munition loads were needed for a later stage of the attack and would not have significantly contributed to the attrition phase of the battle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Wedge, you want to skirt the edge of that fur-ball? Or thin out the opposition a bit on the way to the main objective?&quot; asked Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your call. I&#039;m on your wing either way,&quot; was the response.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just do your best to keep up, then,&quot; she half-taunted before switching to the Alliance all-units channel. &quot;Crusader lead to all units. We&#039;re coming through at 43 by 98. Try not to hit us by accident, fellas.&quot;</p><p class="double">The <i>Millennium Falcon</i> roared toward a clump of six TIEs that somehow managed to maintain something resembling a formation in the chaos of frantic maneuvers. Three rapidly fell to Pansy&#039;s expert gunnery, a fourth to Cookie&#039;s less accurate fire, and the remaining two to Wedge&#039;s lasers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Copper lead to Crusader lead, thanks for the help,&quot; said the leader of the Y-Wing squadron that had been the recipient of the TIEs&#039; attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem. I&#039;d love to stay and chat, but we&#039;ve got an appointment with the Death Star.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The reports filtering into the Death Star comm center did not help Tarkin&#039;s temper in any way.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fifty percent losses in under a minute?&quot; he asked incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes sir. The rebels made heavy use of long-range weapons to attrit our fighters before closing. Survivor reports indicate that their missile targeting was especially well coordinated,&quot; reported the Fighter Group commander.</p><p class="double">&quot;We have two ships incoming,&quot; cut in a sensor technician. &quot;Profile matches YT-1300 and X-Wing class.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just two?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How large a reserve do we have on hand?&quot; Tarkin turned back to the fighter commander.</p><p class="double">&quot;Three understrength squadrons. Two of recon and one of surface-attack fighters. We sent every standard space combat version we had in the attack group,&quot; he responded after consulting a datapad.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well you&#039;d best prepare some sort of reception for our guests.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo fought down her panic as over twenty-five TIEs appeared on the sensor display. &quot;Remember when I complained about how the Tatooine departure was too dull? I take it back again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not as bad as it looks,&quot; soothed Wedge over their private channel. &quot;See those six fighters at the rear of the formation? I&#039;ll bet those are surface-attack models. Think TIE Bomber maneuverability without the beefed up spaceframe.&quot;</p><p class="double">{{I would speculate that the remainder are Reconnaissance versions. A little faster that the standard, but only one laser cannon each,}} added Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">&quot;Besides, we don&#039;t have to kill them all, just blow past them and get to the trench. We&#039;re faster than they are,&quot; reminded Wedge.</p><p class="double">The missile lock alarm started beeping by way of counterpoint.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah. Those surface-attack fighters can carry concussion missiles or proton torpedoes, but they need targeting help from a recon platform,&quot; amended Wedge apologetically.</p><p class="double">&quot;Four separate lock-on attempts,&quot; reported Apple Bloom. &quot;Countermeasures standin&#039; by.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gunners to point-defense mode,&quot; ordered Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">Four proton torpedoes and two concussion missiles darted out to meet the two rebel ships. Half immediately fell victim to the enhanced electronic countermeasures available to the looping crews and went inert after losing their targets. One more was eliminated by defensive fire, and one lost to evasive maneuvers.</p><p class="double">The remaining concussion missile targeted on the <i>Falcon</i> impacted with enough power to reduce aft shield strength by 25 percent. <i>Too bad that wasn&#039;t one of the missiles Clover &quot;fixed&quot;. Then again, canary yellow paint doesn&#039;t really work for the</i> Falcon, thought Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">Closing at maximum speed, there was barely time for the fighters arrayed against them to get off more than three or four shots each. To the credit of the imperial pilots, they did score enough hits to degrade the forward shields of each ship by one third.</p><p class="double">Then they were through the Imperial formation. Pansy and Cookie did make their presence known by destroying two of the missile platforms in passing with Wedge accounting for a third.</p><p class="double">&quot;Re-routin&#039; weapon power to shields,&quot; announced Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">{{Time to trench waypoint: Four minutes,}} added Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">&quot;How you doing, Wedge?&quot; asked Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shields are a bit chewed up. No significant damage. Should be ready for the trench by the time we get there.&quot;</p><p class="double">Leaving the TIEs in their exhaust, the two ships screamed toward the battle station.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re breaking and running!&quot; announced a jubilant flight control officer.</p><p class="double">A subdued cheer went around the rebel flagship command deck.</p><p class="double">&quot;Give me a count,&quot; ordered Dodonna as his staff returned their attention to their duties.</p><p class="double">&quot;Working on it now,&quot; replied the fighter group commander. &quot;We have twenty-eight X-Wings, thirty-two Y-Wings, and fifteen headhunters combat capable. Units report twenty-five to fifty percent munition loads remaining. Damaged fighters are being taken aboard. Deploying S&amp;R shuttles to pick up ejected pilots now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remaining enemy force count is around twenty in pairs or singletons,&quot; added the fleet intelligence officer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Have the X-Wings and Y-Wings re-organize and move to support Solo. Keep the headhunters as combat space patrol. The task force will move to within sensor range of the Death Star,&quot; said the general.</p><p class="double">Amid the flurry of acknowledgements, Cadance murmured into her headset. &quot;Luke, I think Spike and Twilight could use you around now.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>This sure beats the baseline</i>, thought Wedge Antilles as he followed the <i>Falcon</i> down the familiar confines of the first Death Star trench. <i>No time pressure, no Vader and his goons chewing up my aft shields...practically a leisurely stroll to the torpedo launch point.</i></p><p class="double">His late model XJ series advanced snubfighter was the result of decades of improvements made to the T-65 X-Wing platform. The most relevant of those improvements right now was the much more powerful targeting sensors and computer systems. What he had called impossible with baseline equipment was merely difficult with tools from forty years later.</p><p class="double">He made another not-really-necessary adjustment to his targeting computer. He had made this shot under much worse circumstances dozens of times.</p><p class="double">Ahead, he watched the <i>Falcon</i> launch the first of several enhanced ion-pulse warheads at the turbolaser emplacements defending the exhaust port. Combining the electronics-disrupting qualities of a heavy ion cannon with an extended range concussion missile frame, they were an excellent tool for silencing defensive turrets at long range.</p><p class="double">&quot;Show&#039;s all yours, Wedge,&quot; declared Scootaloo as the final missile was sent on its way and the <i>Falcon</i> peeled up and out of the trench to discourage any fighters bold enough to consider interfering.</p><p class="double">Chopping his throttle, Wedge watched the range to optimal launch point projected in his heads-up display (another improvement over the original targeting scope) count down slowly...1000 meters...700 meters...500 meters...250...100...50...</p><p class="double">&quot;Torpedoes away!&quot; he called as three proton torpedoes -- the XJ squeezed a third torpedo launch tube onto the fighter -- flew down the trench. Pushing his throttle to maximum power, he watched two of the three pinkish-white globes entering the exhaust port; the third overshot and impacted on the surface beyond the target zone. <i>Oh well. Looks like I owe Luke a round of drinks.</i> &quot;Two hits. Time to leave,&quot; he reported as he pulled up and away from the Death Star.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mission accomplished,&quot; said the protocol droid. &quot;All units pulling back.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vader had watched the rout of the imperial fighter force with growing rage. <i>How could this rabble so easily defeat the cream of the imperial military?</i></p><p class="double">The holoprojector&#039;s tactical view of the battle switched to what must be a live video feed from one of the vessels retreating from the Death Star. Vader was only passingly aware that the room&#039;s single door had opened and admitted an additional figure.</p><p class="double">The image of the Death Star suddenly blossomed into an expanding sphere of debris as the hypermatter reactor overloaded.</p><p class="double">All Force sensitives in the room winced as several hundred thousand imperial lives abruptly ceased.</p><p class="double">The Sith Lord&#039;s rage suddenly gave way to resignation. <i>Why can&#039;t I maintain my anger?</i> Ever since that clash with Spike, he was unable to sustain the cold fury that was his link to the Dark Side. It was almost as if the reawakened memories of his life as a Jedi were actively fighting the training he had received from Darth Sidious.</p><p class="double">He felt a growing sense of weariness that matched the expression on Spike&#039;s face. &quot;Well, now what?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s partially up to you,&quot; answered Spike. &quot;Before we go much further, there are one or two things I would like for you to see.&quot; He turned and nodded at the protocol droid.</p><p class="double">The holoprojector&#039;s scene changed to what appeared to be a Clone Wars era medical facility. Vader&#039;s attention was drawn to the figure being attended to by Spike and a medical droid. &quot;Padme...&quot; he whispered.</p><p class="double">&quot;You hurt her badly on Mustafar,&quot; said Spike, &quot;but she was still alive when you and I parted. I took her to Polis Massa for treatment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Palpatine said she was...That I had...&quot; Vader murmured.</p><p class="double">&quot;...There&#039;s good in him. Spike, there&#039;s still good...&quot; Padme Amidala&#039;s last words reached across the years.</p><p class="double">This had been one of the trickier bits of manipulation by Apple Bloom, Sweetie, Spike, and Twilight as they prepared for this meeting. Luke had baseline imagery of Padme&#039;s death form recordings made by Artoo. Spike&#039;s loop memories matched the recording with the exceptions of his substitution in the scene and Cadance&#039;s name. &quot;Correcting&quot; the holographic record to reflect the reality of this loop&#039;s backstory was, if not exactly difficult, a tedious project with several opportunities to get things badly wrong. Spike and Luke assuring them that the underlying truth would be sufficient for the task had not been entirely convincing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Two children...?&quot; asked Vader. He turned to look at the new figure that had joined them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, father,&quot; replied the young man, stopping his efforts to mask his Force presence. &quot;I&#039;m Luke Skywalker.&quot; The boy had a preternatural air of calm and maturity at odds with his obvious youth. He was also the strongest Force presence in the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;...and Cadance...Oh no...&quot; The realization was nearly a physical blow to the black-armored figure.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Spike sadly. &quot;That will be a major problem. As are most of your actions at the end of the Clone Wars and since.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fury boiled within the Sith Lord as he came to his feet and he snarled at Spike. &quot;Why are you doing this? Is this your idea of revenge?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike did not move, although the twi&#039;lek and Luke had tensed for action. &quot;I want you to understand that Palpatine has been manipulating events since before we met on Tatooine. He orchestrated both sides the Clone Wars, killing tens of millions just to eradicate the Jedi. He fed your ambition and your resentment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Jedi Council did not acknowledge my greatness! They held me back! YOU held me back! You kept me from the knowledge I needed to...save...Padme...&quot; As suddenly as the outburst came, the rage subsided. He returned to his seat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tell me. Has Palpatine ever followed up on his promises? Has he shared any of his knowledge regarding life extension with you? He&#039;s had twenty years to raid the Jedi Archives for &#039;forbidden knowledge&#039;. Has he given you the smallest scrap?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There was always something else that needed to be done first. And with Padme dead, it no longer mattered...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand now that the strictures against emotional attachment fed your fear. Would it help in any way if I told you that I now feel that such dogmatic adherence to those beliefs was counterproductive? I&#039;ve had nearly twenty years to meditate and reflect.&quot; Actually Spike had had several orders of magnitude more time to contemplate Jedi teachings and his relationship to the Force, but that wasn&#039;t exactly relevant. &quot;I believe that the critical error of the Jedi Council was our outright rejection of emotion, since we believed it to be a path to the Dark Side. Instead, more emphasis should have been placed on managing one&#039;s emotions over allowing those emotions to rule you.&quot; He coughed. &quot;Sorry, I guess the old lecturing habits are still there.&quot; For some reason he traded a look with the twi&#039;lek.</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; Vader&#039;s tone was almost sullen.</p><p class="double">&quot;I want you to let go of the hatred that you have been sustaining for the last two decades. I know that it&#039;s infinitely easier to say than to do, but that is what I want.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I want my friend Anakin back. I want to help the man I called my brother become better than what he is now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How can you...? After Mustafar, we...&quot; Vader trailed off into silence.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you asking if I forgive you for what you did? I honestly can&#039;t say if I&#039;m ready to...yet. But I want to believe that my old friend regrets having done those things and wants to make amends,&quot; said Spike softly.</p><p class="double">&quot;There is no way I could possibly...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably not. Does that mean you have no desire to do so?&quot;</p><p class="double">Vader did not answer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Master Kenobi, the task force is ready to jump into hyperspace,&quot; interrupted the droid, gesturing at the control console.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you,&quot; responded Spike. He returned his attention to his former padawan. &quot;One more point: I won&#039;t speculate on how Padme would feel about who you are now, but based on the limited time I&#039;ve spent in their company, I believe that she would be pleased at how your children have done so far. Perhaps you might be interested in getting to know them as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">The barabel stood. &quot;I realize that you have a lot to think about. I want to make it clear that while you are a prisoner, you will be treated properly unless you make it necessary to employ more forceful restraints...so to speak.&quot; He turned to the twi&#039;lek. &quot;Can you handle him for a few minutes? I&#039;d like a word with Luke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem, Spike.&quot; She cracked her knuckles and focused a cool gaze on the Sith Lord. &quot;If worse comes to worse, I can put him back in the transporter.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>This would be a whole lot easier if we had a complete set of Elements. If they could purge Nightmare Moon, they could probably do something useful to Vader</i>, thought Spike as he and Luke entered the corridor. &quot;So, what do you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a good start. You got through to him at least twice. I can sense inner turmoil similar to what I felt from him on the second Death Star during the baseline. I&#039;ve managed to talk him around on my own a few times, and we can double-team him in the next session.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Given how recent Alderaan is, I doubt it&#039;s worth trying to bring in Cadance.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. It took Leia years to come to terms with it in the baseline. After only a few days? No way.&quot;</p><p class="double">The background of thrum of the engines ramped up briefly as the ship made the jump to lightspeed.</p><p class="double">Spike stretched. &quot;Four hours to Yavin. Based on the tactical view we were watching, I will say that I&#039;m impressed with how the battle turned out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. That was one of the smoother near-baseline Death Star takedown I&#039;ve seen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Near-baseline?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remind me to tell you about the time we were invaded by the entire Borg Collective and both Vorlon and Shadow fleets. Or one time Ranma visited and decided to dust off the contents of his pocket...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Epilogue -- Several weeks later</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the space between Yavin IV and the gas giant it orbited, Scootaloo struggled to keep her targeting reticle on the opposing fighter. &quot;Not making it easy for me, Pansy,&quot; she grumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought that was the point of the excercise,&quot; replied the pegasus.</p><p class="double">The X-wing performed a series of turns that any experienced pilot would have declared to be impossible for any mere flesh-and-blood being.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now that&#039;s just being self-indulgent,&quot; muttered Scootaloo. Her threat alarm started beeping, so she threw her ship into a corkscrewing evasive turn. To her annoyance, not only did the alarm continue its warning, but her rear shield indicator began showing a rapid drain. The fighter&#039;s systems shut down and the flight computer flashed a &quot;You have been destroyed&quot; message as Pansy&#039;s X-wing flew past.</p><p class="double">&quot;No fair, Pansy! You don&#039;t need to worry about acceleration compensators,&quot; she complained as she restored her ship&#039;s systems from simulated &quot;death&quot;.</p><p class="double">&quot;If you&#039;re not cheating, you aren&#039;t trying hard enough,&quot; retorted the founder. &quot;It&#039;s not as if you haven&#039;t killed me enough times in that prototype TIE.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo grinned. <i>Let Spike keep Vader&#039;s lightsaber as a souvenir. I&#039;ve got his personal fighter with a cool custom paint job.</i></p><p class="double">Her only concern was whether she had enough room for it in her subspace pocket. Maybe she wouldn&#039;t try to pack the <i>Falcon</i> in there before the loop ended.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome back to the land of the conscious,&quot; said Twilight as she looked at the medical center&#039;s sensor readouts. &quot;How are you feeling? I did my best for you, but there may still be some lingering problems that I wasn&#039;t able to completely clear up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it. It&#039;s a vast improvement over where I was before. So this is your native form?&quot; asked her patient.</p><p class="double">The lavender alicorn nodded. &quot;Close enough. I normally don&#039;t bother with the wings, but I&#039;m able to channel more power this way, and you certainly needed everything I could give.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m still a bit surprised at your generosity. I would have placed conditions on providing what you freely offered.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I prefer to think of it as a gesture of goodwill. And I suppose the supremely suspicious would call it an inducement toward a particular behavior pattern. But I mostly did it as a favor for Luke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see. And Spike?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was his idea. He and Luke are waiting outside if you want to talk to them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe in a while.&quot; The figure in the recovery bed sighed. &quot;Aren&#039;t you concerned that once I recover sufficiently, I&#039;ll go back to the old ways?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you worried about that happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">A faint nod. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you want it to happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">A shake of the head. &quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then I&#039;m satisfied that between Luke, Spike, myself, and especially you, we can keep things under control.&quot;</p><p class="double">Anakin Skywalker lifted his arms and examined the nearly life-like prosthetic hands. He flexed the fingers experimentally, then touched the tips together. &quot;Impressive work. I especially appreciate the tactile sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We can try biological regeneration of your limbs later if you want; it would have added several months of physical therapy to your recovery, and I didn&#039;t want to add more complexity on top of the work on your internal organs. Getting you out of that life-support suit was the priority,&quot; explained Twilight. &quot;Don&#039;t be surprised if you tire easily and find yourself short of breath after even mild exertion for the next year or so. It&#039;s going to take a while to get your strength up, even with the Force.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not complaining. Frankly, I could probably use the quiet time.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Emperor Palpatine sat uneasy in his private sanctum, facing, but not really seeing, the holographic display depicting the galaxy he ruled.</p><p class="double">Ever since the loss of the Death Star and disappearance of Darth Vader four months ago, whispers in the Force had brought him to believe that a dire threat to his position was gathering.</p><p class="double">His brooding was interrupted as he felt a well-known Force presence nearby. The private side door opened and he heard a familiar mechanical breathing.</p><p class="double">&quot;You took long enough getting back here. What happened? Where have you been?&quot; he snapped without turning to face his guest.</p><p class="double">&quot;You wouldn&#039;t believe me if I told you,&quot; came the reply. <i>Wait. The voice is all wrong.</i> He spun his chair to face two intruders.</p><p class="double">One was a barabel in jedi robes. <i>Kenobi? How could he...?</i> But his attention was drawn to the human of the pair.</p><p class="double">It was Anakin Skywalker. Twenty years older and bearing many scars, but recognizably the jedi knight he had renamed Darth Vader following Mace Windu&#039;s death. He was supporting himself with a stout cane, and on a lanyard around his neck was a portable audio playback device from which the iconic respiration sounds emanated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Treachery!&quot; snarled Palpatine, launching bolts of Force Lightning toward the two. Kenobi effortlessly caught the streams of darkside energy in his outstretched hands and compressed them into a sparking ball before sending it back toward its source. The emperor found himself the recipient of a face-full of his own lightning.</p><p class="double">&quot;We regret to inform you that Darth Vader died during the action that destroyed the Death Star,&quot; continued the former Sith Lord.</p><p class="double">Before Palpatine could recover his wits and lash out with the Force again or summon his guards, Kenobi took some sort of comlink from his belt and brought it to his lips, saying, &quot;Three to beam up.&quot;</p><p class="double">The world dissolved into sparkles. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">From the Looping Journals of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">I awoke to a ruined stone city covered in snow and filled with unsavory characters. I checked my memories, which seemed to contradict my current situation. Apparently I was supposed to be a first year high school student in Tokyo, but I was playing a druid in the online game, Elder Tales, in a guild called Crescent Moon Alliance.</p><p class="double">The stone city I awoke in was named Susukino after the red light district in Hokkaido, Japan. It was a dark city, known for the guild that ran it. Brigandia was a brutal guild before the game began, and things only got progressively worse under their rule. Following narrative causality, I assumed incorrectly that the goal of the loop was dislodging Brigandia from the city. Unfortunately, my class was mostly for healing and only knew a few attack spells and creature summonings. Furthermore, my character was at a low level, not even level 40 or 50, while the top players were level 90. Still, I had advantages, including several previous loops of combat experience. Furthermore, I was a looper. The menu allowed several upgrades to my character that put me well above anyone in Brigandia.</p><p class="double">While I was searching through my menu and before I could try assaulting Brigandia&#039;s Guild Hall, I was approached by an anthropomorphic cat, who introduced himself as Nyanta. He played a Swashbuckler as his main class in the game with a chef subclass. Apparently, chefs were the only class that could make food with taste, meaning everything tasted like dull crackers without even salt.</p><p class="double">Anyway, he had come to know everyone in Susukino over the course of the loops, but didn&#039;t recognize me and figured me for a looper. Nyanta was the perfect gentleman, courteous and always willing to give good advice and protect the innocent. I shared with him my journeys through the multiverse. He shared with me a few tips and tricks on how to interact with others, how a word in one circle and some encouragement in another could cause events that would bring down Brigandia without raising a single blade.</p><p class="double">We spent a week in Susukino, taking apart the remnants of Brigandia. After the trash was removed, we helped the locals in setting up a governing body to protect the players and the NPCs, otherwise known as the People of the Land, or &#039;landers&#039; for short. A week later, Nyanta&#039;s guildmaster arrived by griffon mount. His name was Shiroe, the anchor of the Elder Tales loops. Upon first glance, he didn&#039;t seem special or even important, like someone who&#039;d fade into the back of a crowd, but overlooking him would be a mistake. He&#039;s a strategist, able to predict his opponents long term moves and counter appropriately. One of Nyanta&#039;s guild mates, Naotsugu, bragged that Shiroe could predict his opponents moves over a 30 second interval with a 1% margin of error. </p><p class="double">We made our way to Akiba, a starter city, where my guild celebrated my safe return with a massive party. In some ways, Crescent Moon reminded me of Equestria, a guild full of friends who considered each other family and whose purpose was to support the other adventurers in Elder Tales. As my thoughts turned to Equestria, I couldn&#039;t help but long for home, for my dear friend Twilight. Maryelle approached me and asked what was wrong? It was then I realized tears were freely flowing down my cheeks, and I excused myself from the party. </p><p class="double">Shiroe followed after me to see if I was OK. He seemed to see through me as he asked when I had last been in my home loop. After I had calmed down a bit, he started sharing his adventures with the Equestrian loopers. A friend of his was replaced once by Pinkie and they had an adventuring party that lasted all loop. He had also met Twilight and another Equestrian looper, Trixie, in a Hogwarts fused loop. Finally, there was a massive fused loop where most of the Equestrian Loopers were present.</p><p class="double">It was at that massive fused loop that Elder Tales was declared a training loop, where one could work on developing their skills. He offered to spend to loop teaching me anything I wanted, and I decided to take him up on his offer.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">So much time has passed since the last entry. The first lesson I learned after Crescent Moon&#039;s celebration was never drink anything Shiroe gave you. He likes to test his alchemy skills by creating new appearance changing potions for his fellow loopers. Nothing harmful, but I was a bit shocked to be a unicorn once again. He offered to change me back, but I declined...at least for now. Besides, it was a great opportunity to learn how to wield a keyblade as a pony.</p><p class="double">After being human for so many loops, it was strange being a pony. No fingers to scratch my back, everything had to be held by teeth or magic, occasionally I wondered how I got by as a pony? And then there were the stares from those I passed in the streets. Eventually, they stopped after the story of my tragic alchemy accident trapped me in this body circulated around town. I think Shiroe was behind that, but I never asked.</p><p class="double">Besides my keyblade training, I immersed myself in studying with a vigor that would make Twilight proud. I learned about economics, diplomacy and interaction with others, how to own and operate a store, Celestia I was even tutored in real world engineering by Shiroe. Twilight probably loved it here, an entire loop designated to teaching and learning.</p><p class="double">Events came and went like a hurricane. Shiroe took Akiba by storm, forming the Round Table Council to govern the affairs of Akiba. Before a month had passed, the People of the Land invited Akiba to join the League of Freedom Cities Eastal, a council of Nobles that rule the Eastern mainland of what would be Japan. I forgot to mention, the world of Elder Tales was designed like the hub human world, only half as big, so Akiba was located on the landmass that would be Japan.</p><p class="double">Shiroe offered to have me come along and gain some practical skills in diplomacy, but I declined. As a unicorn, I figured my presence would make too many waves in certain circles. Instead, I traveled with Maryelle, my guildmaster, to the Sandleaf Peninsula for some more combat training. While there, I made a couple new friends: Minori and Touya, twins part of Shiroe&#039;s guild, Rundelhouse Code or Rudy for short, a sorcerer not affiliated with any guild, and Isuzu, a bard from Crescent Moon.</p><p class="double">It was during one of our training sessions that goblins attacked the Peninsula while Sahuagin, amphibious monsters similar to goblins, attacked the beaches of Choushi, the headquarters of our training regiment. I decided to cut loose and use all my looping skills to hold them off. It led to several awkward questions between myself and my fellow adventurers especially when I flooded the beach with fire jutsu, but we drove them off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">We spent the next few weeks defending Choushi. Apparently, this was a regular event in the game world called Return of the Goblin King. Rudy nearly died defending Choushi, which scared us when we discovered he was a lander. For Adventurers like me and Shiroe, dying wasn&#039;t permanent, but for landers, it was.</p><p class="double">After we drove off the monsters, We held a celebration at Eastal&#039;s Headquarters, with with a ballroom dance and food. There, I decided to leave Crescent Moon Guild for Shiroe&#039;s Log Horizon. Maryelle was very understanding, though seemed a bit sad.</p><p class="double">Things quieted down after that, with Shiroe taking me on occasional training trips and teaching me as much as he could about strategy. I would probably never be up to his level, I did gain a battlefield sense, allowing me to assess my situation in battle in an instant and determine when it would be best to switch tactics and keychains.</p><p class="double">The loop came to an end a few months later, the last moments were spent just outside the Depths of Palm, a dungeon in the game, on a cliff overlooking the rising sun. It was one of Shiroe&#039;s favorite spots. As the loop came to an end, I knew I would miss Theldesia, but maybe, just maybe, this next loop would take me home. The rising sun filled me with hope. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">99.4 (Grinnerz)</p><p class="double">Waking up while in the process of waking up was seldom any fun Vinyl decided.</p><p class="double">Waking up to Octavia making a face and pulling down her eyelids even less so.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahhh!&quot; One good shove caused the grey filly to be sent to the floor. Only then did Vinyl realize her sometimes rival/roommate/friend/stranger/special-somepony was, like herself, currently all of seven years old. A fact which was driven home by her immediately tearing up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Momma!

Bloom is tone deaf.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom bit into her wrench in frustration. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">99.6 (Kalimaru)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke over the Tale of the Two Sisters as usual. What wasn&#039;t usual was that it was a video game instead of a book. Levitating it with her magic, Twilight brought the game back to her annex and pulled the necessary equipment from her pocket; A Ponystation 2, a liquid plasma Seapony TV, and a small generator to provide the electricity. Hooking it all up, Twilight began the game and was greeted with Celestia&#039;s wobbling voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;A thousand... yeah, no, a thousand years ago... Something... really bad happened! That&#039;s right, really bad! And now Twilight Spackle, uh, I mean, Sparkles, I need you to... do something! That&#039;s right, do-urp!-do something! Stop putting your face in those dirty books you keep under your bed and, and and and... go on a quest! Yeah! My sister&#039;s going to be there, so prepare your best-hork!-best warrior persons. There&#039;ll be magic. You love it. Honest.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sighing, Twilight facehoofed lightly. &quot;This is why Celestia is allowed near Grog from Monkey Island. She keeps making these &#039;Finite Fictionies&#039; games. I am so going to get Berry for this.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The two fillies and the tortoise stood in a triangle, looking around. Their arrival vessel, mared by First Mate Berry &#039;Sea Legs&#039; Punch and Captain Ditzy Do, sat atop the only pine tree for seven thousand miles and was on fire. Seeing as both captain and first mate were enjoying pineapple drinks (from a nearby Watermelon tree somehow) further down the beach, the children and accidental petnapping victim had been left to their own devices.</p><p class="double">Looking around, Ruby spoke first.</p><p class="double">&quot;THANK FOR THE VACATION, DADDY AND MISS TWILIGHT!&quot;</p><p class="double">Hiding behind a nearby tree, Discord sighed. &quot;What a cute kid.&quot; Behind him, Twilight fumed from her interrupted revenge pranking.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Standing within Apple Bloom&#039;s testing complex, Gilda and Apple Bloom looked upon the small knife with both trepidation and anticipation. Turning to Gilda, Bloom removed her 3-D glasses. &quot;Are you sure you want this thing? It&#039;s already cutting everything around it down one dimension by contact. I don&#039;t really want to know what it&#039;ll do if you stab someone with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda smiled. &quot;Oh, I won&#039;t be stabbing anyone with it. It&#039;s a matter of political escalation. They bring the rude words, I bring the claws. They bring the battle-axes, I bring superior flight training. They bring the Griffon Armed Forces, armed with battle-axes and curse words, I bring the 2-D Knife of Extraplanar Reduction. Simple, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">Any further explanation was ceased when a rather haggard looking Twilight busted down the door. Walking past Gilda and Bloom, she smiled that &#039;off her rocker&#039; smile of hers. &quot;How are you guys? Great? That&#039;s great. Say, I&#039;ll just be borrowing this. One moment.&quot; Grabbing the Razor in her magic, Twilight made an about-face and walked back out through the door. Her voice could be heard fading into the distance. &quot;Oh Berryyyyyyyyyyy~, I&#039;ve got something for you to put in your Grog right here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Twilight! No!&quot; *stab* &quot;No! You turned my Grog into battery acid!&quot;</p><p class="double">Still in the lab, Bloom turned to Gilda as the griffon shrugged. &quot;Ehh, that&#039;s kinda what I thought would happen.&quot;</p><p class="double">Behind them, the manifestation of Occam nodded. &quot;Me too.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">99.7 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Once more, Twilight Awoke reading the tale of the two royal sisters. A quick once-over confirmed that nothing was out of the ordinary this Loop.</p><p class="double">Then Nyx materialized next to her, slumped over on one side. &quot;Mom, we need to talk.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight bolted upright and immediately started checking Nyx for injuries. &quot;Where does it hurt? Or is it numbness? Paralysis? Spinal injury?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mom!&quot; A dark aura surrounded the unicorn and gently but firmly gave Nyx some space. &quot;I&#039;m fine, really. I just having trouble remembering how to walk.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remembering how to... Did you Loop as the TARDIS?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hang on.&quot; Both ponies vanished in a burst of antilight just as three Academy students crested the hill.</p><p class="double">Another burst, and they were in Twilight&#039;s annex. Nyx was still limp from the neck down. &quot;Sorry. Didn&#039;t want to raise any uncomfortable questions.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no, that&#039;s fine.&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;So, it&#039;s easier to teleport than walk right now?&quot;</p><p class="double">A pony-sized Spike looked over the edge of an Iris Drake novel, smiled, and said, &quot;Hi, by the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mother and daughter chorused &quot;Hi, Spike.&quot; Nyx continued, &quot;To answer your question, Mom, yes. And no, I didn&#039;t Loop as the TARDIS. No way I&#039;d be as coherent as I am right now if I had.&quot; One of her hooves twitched. &quot;Ah! Progress!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight knelt next to her. &quot;So what were you? I&#039;m assuming you were somehow discorporate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. I&#039;m not sure what Loop it was, though. It might be new.&quot; Nyx winced. &quot;Ow. Not the wing I meant to stretch.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight telekinetically shifted her onto her belly, limbs sprawled out. It was graceless, but stable. &quot;Better?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Much, thank you. Do you have anything in the Hub fiction database about a place called Theros?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not ringing any bells.&quot; Twilight pulled a PADD from her pocket. &quot;Let&#039;s see... huh. Magic: the Gathering. I&#039;m guessing it wasn&#039;t like the Yu-Gi-Oh Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx had most of her legs under her by this point. She listed a bit, but was staying upright. &quot;Not at all, though it does explain why I never saw an Anchor. Probably never went to that plane.&quot; She took a deep breath &quot;Okay, so imagine taking descriptions of each god in the Greek pantheon, running them through a shredder, and then reassembling them blind.&quot;</p><p class="double">She found herself in a very tight hug. She could feel Twilight shivering against her. &quot;Please, please, please tell me none of them were as bad as Zeus.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx hugged back as best she could. &quot;Not at all. No bulls, no swans, no showers of gold. They thought they were above that kind of thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sagged with relief. &quot;Oh, thank cedar. So, were you some sort of nascent proto-divine archetype or something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I was Olympus. Sort of. For one, I was still called Nyx. For another, I was the night sky.&quot; Nyx scrunched up her face at the memories. &quot;There really aren&#039;t words for what it was like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have been a constellation,&quot; Twilight noted. She smirked. &quot;Usually when you&#039;re trying to rule Equestria without burning it to the ground.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, there were constellations. There were entire ecosystems of the things. It was like a rumbling stomach, only all the time and through my whole body. And the gods were...&quot; Nyx frowned. &quot;Basically, imagine a family of fourteen, none of whom particularly like each other, forced to live in the same house. Now imagine being the house.&quot;</p><p class="double">A brush floated towards them, carried by Twilight&#039;s magic. As she began brushing Nyx&#039;s mane, she asked, &quot;How long?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Several years. I think. All the family drama blended together after a while, and only one being seemed to notice I was self-aware. Still, Kruphix was a pretty nice guy. I think he&#039;s Loop-aware, but he likes seeming all cryptic and aloof.&quot; Nyx gave a smile, but it quickly wilted. &quot;Then Xenagos showed up. If I was a house, then he was breaking and entering. And declaring himself the family&#039;s newest member.&quot;</p><p class="double">The brushing halted. &quot;He tried to ascend?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx shook her head. &quot;Not in a way that put the Loop at risk. The gods were powerful, but they were more like Discworld gods with a lot of belief than admins. Anyway, he basically became Dionysius. Or a really nasty Variant Pinkie. He did declare himself god of revels.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered at the thought. &quot;How&#039;d that go?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, civilization risked collapse due to party overload, and in that world, gods can&#039;t kill each other, so they got a mortal to do it.&quot; Nyx giggled. &quot;And that was when I found out I was a genius loci. You should&#039;ve seen the looks on the gods&#039; faces when I started helping her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike looked back up from his book. &quot;You helped commit deicide?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; Nyx slumped. &quot;But I didn&#039;t stop it either. If I knew more about what I could do and how apotheosis worked there, I might have been able to find some nonlethal option, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nuzzled her. &quot;I&#039;m sure you made the best choice you could.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike moved to his quasi-sister&#039;s side, nodded, and gave her a hug.</p><p class="double">Nyx sniffled and smiled. &quot;Thanks. Both of you. And I know I made the right choice afterwards. The gods were almost soiling themselves after they saw one of their own die. I made sure Elspeth got out of there as soon as she could.&quot; She stood shakily and puffed out her chest. &quot;The heavens were thundering with the Royal Canterlot Voice when the Loop ended. I put everything you taught me into that lecture, Mom.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">99.8 (yannoshka)</p><p class="double">In the wide, wide multiverse embodied with the Yggdrasil - the tree that is not, the living computer, the metaphysical bag that holds the entirety of everything and is simultaneously both within and without itself to the point that Schroedinger&#039;s cat put itself out of it&#039;s undetermined misery...</p><p class="double">A pony Woke up. To complicate things the pony did not, as a matter of fact Wake up as a pony. Well, yes it did, but the looping entity did not Wake up as it&#039;s own definition of pony.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash spit out the bridle in disgust and glared at the mismatched form of a dracoequus that was for some reason known only to the spirit of Chaos himself, walking despondently upon his eyebrows and had until the moment she spat the bridle out been dragging her along. As in literally dragging her along since she apparently had seven legs, all but one of which were pointing inverse to how the equine legs were usually positioned.</p><p class="double">Being an element of loyalty, and quite near to him, she did not even have to do anything to know that he was also awake.</p><p class="double">&quot;What. The. Holly. Bush. Discord?&quot; She growled. But no sooner had her words left her mouth that she realized something further. However absurd the situation they found themselves, all she could feel of Discord was... detachment. No amusement, nor curiosity nor sadness nor anything really. Just a metaphysical sorta gap.</p><p class="double">And somewhere deep within herself a small voice she rarely listened to was frenetically waving around hoping against hope that for once it would be heeded to.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. You&#039;re Awake.&quot; More than anything Discord sounded like a masculine Maude Pie. And that should&#039;ve been scary.</p><p class="double">Dash made a neat note to self to examine the little voice in closer detail - she was definitely not acting, well, thinking at least, like herself - but for the time being she contented herself with answering Discord&#039;s flat statement with an inquiring raise of an eyebrow that Spock would have approved.</p><p class="double">&quot;This loop my sense of humor literally ran away from me shortly after I got freed from petrification. And I only Woke up after the fact myself. So, now you my Loyal steed and companion and myself are on an absurd quest to hunt it down and set back what once went wrong... Or right... It&#039;s all kinda relative... Meh...&quot; Discord continued in his should-be-quite-creepy monotone.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile in another part of relatively (in all the dreadfully ambiguity that the principle in question entailed) the same space-time continuum, a selfsentient ratio of circle&#039;s circumference to it&#039;s diameter contemplated the chromatic resonance of prismatic spectrum near the frequency of 484 terahertz, along the wavelength close but not quite 620 nanometers.

<p>100.1</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Mac mixed the drink Lyra had specified. “Olive oil, absinthe, azeotrope chaser &#039;n&#039; some coffee. Seriously?” </p><p class="double">Lyra nodded. “That is correct. Thank you.”</p><p class="double">“This the whole... multiple... you, thing?”</p><p class="double">“Sort of.” Lyra picked up the drink with an application of telekinesis, and sipped it. Her expression took some interesting shapes. “Basically, you know how all this got kicked off?”</p><p class="double">“Kinda. Y&#039;all... broke something?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much.” Another sip. “Anyway, three of me were relatively normal... well, normal for Equestria. Human girl, unicorn, and a sea pony. But the fourth me, the one who&#039;s talking to you now...”</p><p class="double">She put the drink down, and shrugged. “I was... well, the one who actually used the machine. As far as I can tell, I&#039;m the one who gets all the personality traits from universal bleed.”</p><p class="double">Mac blinked. “Come again, miss?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s the whole unstuck in the universe thing.” This time, Lyra took a mouthful of the drink, and sighed as it went down. “The other mes are quite coherent, so they get memories relating to that – they filter them, sort of. So human Lyra gets memories relating to humans, seapony Lyra gets seapony memories...”</p><p class="double">“Right. Kinda like loop memories?” Mac cleaned a glass with a cloth. The glass in question was already quite clean enough, but it was something any barman learned to do as a time-filler.</p><p class="double">“Sort of.” Lyra sipped again. “And I/we split the workload on interpreting them. I actually get less than the other three to work with... it&#039;s just that I get all the strange stuff. Robots, changelings, mad science earth ponies working on inventing a Human Analogue Neat Device...”</p><p class="double">Berry Punch giggled from the experiments cabinet. “A HAND, huh?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Lyra took another slug. “Anyway, the result of that is that I&#039;m... kind of everything at once that the other three aren&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like most loopers,” Mac deadpanned.</p><p class="double">Lyra shrugged. “Suppose. And that&#039;s why my taste in drinks looks like it was selected by picking four random bottles out of a bottle bank.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Berry marched around the counter and sat down next to her. “You have no <i>idea</i> how much I appreciate a challenge! Want to see if we can make something with pesto that you&#039;d like?”</p><p class="double">Lyra&#039;s eyes unfocused for a moment. “The other three went ew. I&#039;m game.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.2</p><p class="double">“Ah, it&#039;s good to see you,” Spike said, smiling, as he released his embrace.</p><p class="double">“Likewise, dear,” Rarity replied. “Was it long?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty long,” Spike admitted. “Last-but-one Loop was an Arda one.”</p><p class="double">Rarity winced.</p><p class="double">“And last loop...” Spike paused. “Well, we <i>do</i> need to discuss it sometime...” He sighed. “You got a crush on me.”</p><p class="double">His wife blinked. “...I&#039;d have thought it was usually the other way around...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, har har.” He tapped her on the hock. “No, I think it was a combination of my undeniable awesomeness and the fact I was about half as big again as you that loop.”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled archly at him. “Well, you&#039;re hardly the Element of <i>Modesty</i>, are you?” she asked impishly.</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s a thing.” Spike shrugged. “I point to Scootaloo and Dash.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, fair point, dear.” They shared a chuckle.</p><p class="double">“...but, yeah,” Spike said, bringing them back to the topic. “Basically, we need to hash out what to do in that kind of situation.”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. “Good point, yes... we&#039;ve sort of just assumed a no, haven&#039;t we?”</p><p class="double">“We have, yeah.” Spike sat down, sighing. “And I usually <i>am</i> better at heading off your unawake interests in me when they develop, these loops... it&#039;s just... it was a long time.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn sat down next to him, silent.</p><p class="double">“So... yeah. I know that Shining and Cadence have a standing agreement that it&#039;s fine whether one or even neither is Awake, so...” Claws drummed on the ground, leaving dents. “And I don&#039;t even know <i>what</i> Trix and Chrysalis do...”</p><p class="double">Rarity frowned. “I may have a suggestion.”</p><p class="double">“Go on,” Spike invited.</p><p class="double">“If one of us is Awake, they can... <i>reciprocate</i> as appropriate.” Rarity hummed. “Don&#039;t start anything, don&#039;t go to a further stage of the relationship, and,” she smiled. “And if the unawake one is about ten years old, the awake one can limit it to the affection appropriate.”</p><p class="double">Spike mulled that over. “...yeah, seems fair. But – I&#039;d say that, if it gets to the point of clear romantic involvement, we should tell the unawake one about the loops. Come clean about it.”</p><p class="double">“Good idea.”</p><p class="double">Rarity leaned into his shoulder, and for several seconds they sat looking up at the morning sky.</p><p class="double">“...Berry got romantically involved last loop,” Spike commented.</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Rarity raised an eyebrow delicately. “Do tell.”</p><p class="double">Spike grinned. “The old flatfish himself – Discord.”</p><p class="double">Rarity took a moment to process that.</p><p class="double">“...huh.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that was about my reaction too,” Spike agreed. “Hey, want to try something new I thought of?”</p><p class="double">“Do go on.”</p><p class="double">“Well, basically, it involves my dragonfire, the cloth-form spell, a carpet made from same, and the command release phrase being &#039;last forever&#039;...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.3</p><p class="double">“...so, that&#039;s about the shape of things,” Twilight finished, clicking the slideshow off. “I know you&#039;ve had the talk before, but that was the version for local loopers so it should orient you here.”</p><p class="double">The Saddle Arabian stallion seated on an entire bench nodded. “Thanks. That was a very professional briefing.”</p><p class="double">“I try,” Twilight allowed. “Now, how does a looper get the pony name &#039;Free Spirit&#039;?”</p><p class="double">This elicited a sigh.</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is kinda strange,” he began. “I&#039;ve got a baseline, and then I seem to have another completely different one I spend almost as much time in. I&#039;m a horse there, by the way-”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight looked him up and down. “Explains why you were so comfortable on four hooves, most newcomers are a bit coltish for a day or so.”</p><p class="double">She rummaged in her pocket, and brought out a notepad. “Okay, I don&#039;t get to play this often... give me clues, and I&#039;ll see if I can work out who you are.”</p><p class="double">Free Spirit nickered a laugh. “Now <i>this</i> is familiar. First clue – my name&#039;s David Webb.”</p><p class="double">Twilight dropped the notebook, rummaged again for a second, pulled out a novel, and then held it up. “Not <i>Weber</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Nope, Webb.” He grinned, rolling back his lip to reveal really rather large teeth. “And it&#039;s not actually much of a clue, almost no-one knows me by that name.”</p><p class="double">“I see...” Twilight noted it down anyway. “Well, I&#039;m stumped... next?”</p><p class="double">Another chuckle. “I&#039;m going to be really inconvenient. This one&#039;s from my sort-of-other-baseline. I was a herd stallion.”</p><p class="double">“Not surprised,” Twilight muttered. He was <i>huge</i>, even for a Saddle Arabian.</p><p class="double">“Third clue – I don&#039;t get on well with the US government...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">About half an hour later, Twilight held up her pad of paper in triumph. “Finally!”</p><p class="double">She then looked at the extra data alongside the names, and blinked. “Okay, apparently both your baseline and your most common other loop have versions in the Hub where you&#039;re played by the same actor.”</p><p class="double">The big stallion shrugged.</p><p class="double">“So...” she paused. “Do you prefer Spirit, or Jason?”</p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s go with Spirit.” The mustang stood. “Speaking of which, I think you mentioned a bar?”</p><p class="double">“I did. Follow me.”</p><p class="double">As they left the library, Twilight looked back at him. “Solved most of the problems with your baselines? If not, I could lend a hoof...”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m good.” Spirit bobbed his head in a shrug. “By now I just keep recorded confessions from the CIA operatives in question. As for the US cavalry, they&#039;re usually <i>remarkably</i> surprised by a horse who can handle demolitions charges...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.4&nbsp;&nbsp;(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">Sunset walked in to Mac&#039;s Bar, relaxing a little. Twilight was there, draining down a large beer.</p><p>&quot;Ouch, Twilight. What Loop were you in that&#039;s driven you to drink? Eiken? G3? Or...shudder...the Bureau?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;No. I was in the really cheesy Batman Loop...the one where he used that card...&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset facehooved. &quot;OUCH.&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight noticed Sunset smiling. &quot;You&#039;re in a good mood.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset nodded. &quot;Yeah...Things&#039;re actually moving forward in the Canterlot High world. A battle of the bands is going on...and the human versions of your friends are trying to form a band. I have a few tales I heard.&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. &quot;This I gotta hear.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset smirked. &quot;Well, that world&#039;s Trixie and Rainbow Dash got in a guitar duel to get a cool guitar...from what I heard, Dash somehow got her pony traits she had when my baseline self got whooped during the duel. She did give up...but the funniest part of that one? Trixie&#039;s &#039;prize&#039; cost 12 grand! And she didn&#039;t have the money!&quot; Sunset pulled out a trumpet, playing the infamous losing horns tune. </p><p class="double">&quot;Meanwhile, Rarity tried hauling a grand piano by herself to a practice. What she was thinking...Oy. And poor Applejack had to reclaim her bass guitar from those stupid Flim Flam Brothers...had to work for them to pay for her own guitar.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight drank, and said, &quot;That..may be the first time any version of them&#039;s gotten the best of Applejack. What about Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset smiled a little. &quot;Pinkie&#039;s apparently a natural drummer...and Rainbow Dash was seeing it in front of her face and didn&#039;t put it together for a while. And remember the saying &#039;music soothes the savage beast?&#039; If by, &#039;savage beasts&#039;, you mean hamsters, Fluttershy had to reel in a bunch of them after Rarity was helping her take care of them, and well...Hilarity ensued. And remember the thing with Rainbow Dash I mentioned? If I heard right, it happened to all of them in those cases.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. &quot;Guess things aren&#039;t too boring there anymore.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset smiled. &quot;As our bartender&#039;d say, eenope.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.5 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Twilight liked her new castle. Really, she did. But the library had been her home for billions of years, and seeing it explode, implode, get used as a bludgeon, or otherwise destroyed every Loop hurt.</p><p class="double">So she looked for ways to fix it. Prevention was, of course, the top priority, but it almost never worked. It was depressingly reminiscent of the Final Destination Loops, like the tree was destined to be destroyed by Tirek.</p><p class="double">Thus came plan B, reconstruction. Usually, the roots survived, which meant alicorn-level earth pony magic could regrow the place. The reconstruction spell Twilight used on un-Awake Trixie&#039;s wagon (which she would&#039;ve thought of on her own eventually,) worked quite well if enough of the mass hadn&#039;t been incinerated. And in those cases when the place was utterly disintegrated… well, Twilight was working on that.</p><p class="double">Still, at this point, she was often able to reconstitute Golden Oaks before Loop&#039;s end.</p><p class="double">Whether it survived to that point…</p><p class="double">&quot;First, I would like to apologize,&quot; said Trixie, her shield filtering the smoke out of the air. &quot;I completely forgot I put that crate in your basement. Second, look on the bright side. Now we know more about how earth pony magic interacts with explosive compounds. It may even explain Pinkie a little.&quot;</p><p class="double">She waited for a reply. Twilight just stared, pinprick pupils locked on the smoldering crater that had been her regrown home. One of her ears flicked like a deranged metronome. Trixie could see her mane frizzing out hair by hair.</p><p class="double">Trixie coughed into a fetlock. &quot;I&#039;ll just show myself out.&quot; She walked facefirst into the shield, which she only now noticed had gone from blue to purple.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s head never moved away from the smoking ruin. Her voice was oddly distant and dispassionate, as though she were commenting on a movie. &quot;I am going to start lecturing you now, and I&#039;m not sure when I&#039;m going to stop.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Bardic Knowledge)</p><p class="double">Sunset&#039;s Journal:</p><p class="double">Well, that was different. Not the Awakening, nor the fact that I was in a bustling city with species I couldn&#039;t recognize. What made this Loop different is that the local Anchor was actually rather new. Gideon had been confused to not find a friend of his (whom I was apparently replacing) named Chandra. At first I wouldn&#039;t have noticed had he not muttered something about having plans for this Loop. Something about him felt oddly familiar, but I couldn&#039;t place it.</p><p class="double">After I caught up with him, I did my best to explain the situation to him. After the Multiverse speech Mickey had given me and the multitude of places I had been, it was interesting to be on the giving end of it. Especially when I started off about the nature of the Multiverse and he said he already knew what the multiverse was! The different capitalization is important, because he was talking about his local Branch&#039;s multiverse rather than the wider Multiverse that was part of Yggdrasil.</p><p class="double">Kephalai, the city I had Woken up in, was apparently only one world, or &quot;Plane,&quot; in his multiverse. Gideon, this Chandra person (a pyromancer according to my in-Loop memories), and a few others were called Planeswalkers and were the only people who could freely travel between them. I was somewhat surprised when he said I was somehow one of them, but he said that all Planeswalkers could identify another Planeswalker when they meet (this was apparently the familiar feeling I had felt before).</p><p class="double">He taught me how to Planeswalk and how to follow another Planeswalker, and he took me on a tour of the multiverse. There were some very strange places, like that metal place, Mirrodin, or the city-plane Ravnica (I had no frame of reference of whether it or Coruscant was bigger).</p><p class="double">The way magic worked there involved bonding with various landmarks or other places, then using the mana inherint in that bond to cast spells or call on creatures to fight for you. I gave it a try, but it seems that as soon as I went on to the next Loop, I lost all connection with the places I had bonded with. I wonder if I&#039;ll be able to use that kind of magic back in Equestria? </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.6 (Kalimaru)</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s that a statue of, Miss Cheerilee?&quot;</p><p class="double">Looking at the statue, Cheerilee smiled. The Cutie Mark Crusaders and their teacher were all Awake and aware of who it was, but appearances needed to be maintained. This just had the bonus of training Cheerilee to not go overboard on the children. &quot;This menacing monster is known as Conquest. He&#039;s a dangerous creature that the Princesses sealed away millennia ago. Legend says that when he was free, he had the ability to cause strife amongst ponies and turn them to statues.&quot;</p><p class="double">Snips and Snails, ever the intellectuals, grinned at this. &quot;Cooooooooooolll!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee shook her head. This was going to be one of those Loops where the two were testosterone junkeys. &quot;Not &#039;cool&#039;, I&#039;m afraid, but you are close. Conquest&#039;s powers were what first drew the Windigos to Equestria, back before the three pony tribes had become one. If he were to ever get out again, Equestria would probably once again become a frozen wasteland.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooooh.&quot; In the back, the Crusaders smiled and rolled their eyes. As most of the group continued on, Sweetie Bell turned to the others. &quot;I&#039;m thinking this will be a Loop without us being the ones to wake him.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo pointed a hoof over Sweetie&#039;s shoulder. &quot;And you&#039;re right, because those two knuckleheads are about to do it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Still at the statue, Snips and Snails had begun poking the giant hand. &quot;Think there&#039;s a secret entrance to its cell here?&quot; &quot;I hope so. I want to see a Windigo!&quot;</p><p class="double">Galloping towards them, Diamond Tiara swatted the two colts away. &quot;What do you think you&#039;re doing? What if he gets out?&quot; Tapping the pedestal that &#039;Conquest&#039; was mounted on, Diamond Tiara turned and began reprimanding the two. &quot;Do you know how hard it&#039;ll be for everypony if everything gets frozen?&quot;</p><p class="double">The other Crusaders had joined them and were now watching the statue. Applebloom spoke first. &quot;Uh, DT?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait a moment, Apple Bloom.&quot; Tiara returned to her rant. &quot;And another thing!&quot;</p><p class="double">This time it was Nyx&#039;s turn. &quot;Diamond Tiara?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not now! And you two thought-&quot;</p><p class="double">The whole group at once this time. &quot;DIAMOND TIARA!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? What is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Behind her, Master Hand floated free of the pedestal and laughed darkly. &quot;Mwahahaha!&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara facehoofed. &quot;Aw, ficus.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.7 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">The gathered ponies cheered as Mayor Mare announced the start of the Summer Sun Celebration, not that Twilight took notice. Even now, 4 stars converged behind the moon, causing the Mare image on the moon the vanish. Twilight clenched her teeth, hoping nothing bad was about to happen. The birds started chirping and the trumpets blared as Rarity pulled back the screen. But there was no Celestia.</p><p class="double">Dark purple fog rolled in from the backstage as Twilight gasped, &quot;Oh no!&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the fog materialized into a black filly alicorn with a purple mane and cyan eyes. She seemed as frightened as the rest of the ponies confused. Her eyes even now were watering, &quot;M-mommy?! Mommy, where are you?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Her voice rose as tears started flooding down the side of her cheeks. Fluttershy responded quickest by instinct, gliding over to the filly and lifting her up, &quot;There, there, now...what&#039;s your name, little filly?&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly rubbed her eyes clear of tears and gave a small smile, &quot;N-N-Nyx...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head in confusion, &quot;Huh?! Could that really be Nightmare Moon? But she&#039;s so...young!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Nyx, you&#039;re such a brave girl, coming out on that stage to find your mommy. What does she look like?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;S-She&#039;s got a purple coat with the most beautiful cutie mark of them all. It&#039;s really special since her talent is magic...all magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy carried Nyx in her arms as she spoke to the crowd in an uncharacteristically loud tone, &quot;Is there anyone here with the special talent, magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes widened. <i>This had to be her plan</i>, Twilight thought, <i>She knew her only weakness is the Elements of Harmony, and I&#039;m the only one who knows about it here! She&#039;s trying to take me out quick, and she&#039;s already captured the hearts of Ponyville with her cute act! </i>Spike, however, recognized the reference immediately, &quot;Hey, that&#039;s T-&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, Spike was dropped off Twilight&#039;s back as a hoof covered his mouth to stop him talking. Twilight hissed, &quot;Spike! That&#039;s Nightmare Moon, and she&#039;s trying to find me to take us out! We&#039;re the only ones who know about her weakness to the Elements of Harmony. The instant she finds us, she&#039;ll blast us to the moon!&quot;</p><p class="double">However, the damage was already done as Nyx homed in on Twilight, &quot;Mommy!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked to Nyx, &quot;Is Twilight your mommy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Twilight is my mommy! Mommy, I&#039;m up here!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes widened as she levitated Spike onto her back and bolted. Several ponies reacted instantly as they gave chase. Moments after Twilight was out of sight, Celestia appeared in a burst of white light signifying teleportation, &quot;Sorry my little ponies, there was a parasprite invasion in Manehatten that demanded my immediate attention-&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eyes landed on Nyx in Fluttershy&#039;s arms and smiled, &quot;Well hello, little one...why are you crying?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx sniffed and barely held bad her sobs, &quot;Mo-Mommy Twilight...she just...just, ran away.&quot;</p><p class="double">The waterworks started again as Celestia seemed surprised, &quot;Twilight Sparkle, my student? She didn&#039;t tell me about any children. Well, we&#039;ll have to get you back to your mommy in a few minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Celestia took Nyx on her back and raised the sun.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, mommy locked herself in the Library and bolted every door and window,&quot; asked Nyx.</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded and giggled, &quot;It&#039;s not often we get to prank an unawake Twilight. She really did need to lighten up and lay off those dusty old books. I bet her newest theory is you&#039;ve corrupted me and I&#039;m now your mind controlled servant, to lull her into a false sense of security.&quot;</p><p class="double">Again, the two shared a laugh before Nyx paused, &quot;Wait, so what&#039;s Luna up to this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She awoke a thousand years ago on the moon before discovering a stargate planted there predating the earliest known life on Equestria. I wonder what she&#039;s been up to.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">General Hammond sat at the table as the Equine Empress of Humankind briefed SG-1 on what to expect from Equestria. O&#039;Neill had his head planted on his hands as he sighed. This was going to be a weird loop. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.8 (AnonymousAsk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was a dark night when Princess Celestia and Princess Luna approached Carousel Boutique, with lightning flashing on the horizon. Twilight closed the door behind the two alicorns, and led them into a small room. Inside they found Sweetie Belle, who had been bound to a bed by her sister’s magic.</p><p class="double">“I’m delighted you managed to come, Princesses,” said Rarity, not taking her eyes off her sister.</p><p class="double">“After Twilight’s letter, we felt we had no choice,” Celestia replied. “What is happening to Sweetie Belle?”</p><p class="double">“I’m sorry Princess, we’re not sure,” Twilight responded. “But we think the phantom of a Windigo may be trying to take over her body.”</p><p class="double">Luna raised an eyebrow sceptically. “Are thou sure? Perhaps she is merely ill.”</p><p class="double">“This body WILL be mine!” Sweetie Belle screamed in a voice much gruffer than her own. She began to pull through Rarity’s bindings, and float above her bed.</p><p class="double">“My poor Sweetie Belle...” Rarity had tears in her eyes as she watched.</p><p class="double">The boutique’s doorbell rang through the house, and everypony turned towards the front door. Big Macintosh strode in, wearing priest’s robes. Twilight left Sweetie’s room and approached him.</p><p class="double">“Please tell me you’re the professional we called,” Twilight begged.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup.” Big Macintosh nodded as he gave his reply. He walked into Sweetie’s room, and took a deep breath.</p><p class="double">“There’s great evil in this room.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle spat a flood of green ooze over Princess Celestia, and strained against Rarity’s magic once more, floating higher in the air. “You’ll never get me, bwahahaha!”</p><p class="double">“Get outta her body, ya Evil Spirit!” Big Mac roared at Sweetie Belle.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle turned her head to face Big Macintosh. “Aaahhh, Big Macintosh. Your sister is in here with us. I can send her a message if you’d like.” An eerie smile spread across her lips as she spoke.</p><p class="double">“Sis, get outta here, please, Ah’m tryin’ ta work.” Big Macintosh sighed, face in hoof.</p><p class="double">Applebloom crawled out from under the bed, muttering under her breath. Big Macintosh could have sworn he heard her call him a killjoy as she passed him. He shook his head, before turning back to Sweetie Belle “In the name of the Princesses, Ah command ya ta leave this body!” He began waving around a holy symbol which depicted both Celestia and Luna.</p><p class="double">“...What?” The two alicorns asked in unison, both utterly confused by proceedings.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle screamed over them, with words no pony present had ever heard.</p><p class="double">Celestia’s eyes widened, as she turned to Rarity. “Where did she learn this?”</p><p class="double">Rarity stood, mouth agape. It took a few seconds for her to regain her composure long enough to answer the Princess. “Well, it was most certainly not from me. Perhaps it was from one of Miss Cheerilee’s classes?”</p><p class="double">“Does anyone else feel it getting colder in here?” Luna asked, backing away from Sweetie Belle, and towards the doorway. Ice was slowly spreading across the ceiling.</p><p class="double">“In the name of Princess Celestia, an’ Princess Luna, an&#039; Nightmare Moon...” Big Macintosh yelled, raising his symbol higher.</p><p class="double">“Why are thou mentioning me twice?” Luna asked, an eyebrow raised.</p><p class="double">“Ugghhh...” Sweetie Belle started, before her head slowly began to rotate 360 degrees. Once finished, she had a short coughing fit, before a small white light, which then evaporated.</p><p class="double">Rarity practically leapt onto the bed, embracing her little sister “Are you alright, Sweetie Belle?”</p><p class="double">“Fine... Can’t... Breathe...” Sweetie Belle choked out, but her sister didn’t seem to notice.</p><p class="double">Twilight breathed a sigh of relief, before turning to the Princesses “Thank you for coming Princesses. If you hadn’t been here, who knows what could have happened.”</p><p class="double">“You’re... most welcome, Twilight.” Celestia replied, still trying to understand what actually <i>had</i> happened.</p><p class="double">“Did we even do anything, Tia?” Luna whispered, before receiving a swift kick from her sister, which she understood to be a message to keep quiet. The pair gave their goodbyes, before leaving the boutique.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle waited for a few seconds, before slinking out of her sister’s grasp “They gone?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I think they’re probably back in Canterlot Castle by now...” Twilight said, staring out of a window.</p><p class="double">“I must admit, I found it funny.” Sweetie Belle said, clicking one of her hooves before transforming back to Discord.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup.” Replied the quiet farmer.</p><p class="double">“However, I think that’s the last time we let you improvise, Big Macintosh.” Rarity said, holding back a giggle “In the name of Nightmare Moon? Seriously?”</p><p class="double">“I did like Applebloom appearing from under the bed.” Discord said, laying back on the ceiling.</p><p class="double">“Well, what’s next?” Applebloom said, walking back into the room.</p><p class="double">“We could invite them to the beach, and stage a shark attack.” Discord suggested.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “We did that a few loops ago.”</p><p class="double">“Ooh, we could do Titanic. Me and my dear Spikey-Wikey could play Jack and Rose...” Rarity said as her eyes glazed over.”</p><p class="double">“You do remember that Jack drowns at the end, right?” Twilight said, turning to stare at Rarity.</p><p class="double">“Well, a minor rewrite would be required, of course...” Rarity said, embarrassed at that oversight.</p><p class="double">“How ‘bout we make Celestia Connor an’ the Termiponies?” Applebloom suggested.</p><p class="double">Twilight scratched her chin with a hoof in thought. “Hmmm... We <i>could</i> do it, but we’d need to check that with Skynet first...” She looked around the room “No reason we can’t start the prep work though.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, Ah just thought of somethin’. Where’s the real Sweetie Belle?” Applebloom asked Rarity.</p><p class="double">“Oh, she’s with our Grandparents. They were really eager to meet her this loop for some reason.” Rarity replied, shrugging her hooves. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.9 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;And that is why we need to give our alicorn magic to the one pony Tirek will never expect,&quot; Princess Celestia stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry,&quot; Twilight Sparkle smiled, &quot;I think I know what I can do to stop Tirek from blowing up my tree this time.. er, I mean conquering Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">The princess of the sun shook her head, &quot;You misunderstand me, Twilight. I plan to have all of us give our alicorn magic to.. her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked down where her mentor&#039;s hoof was pointed and saw a smiling grey and blonde pegasus with mis-focused eyes. Ditzy saw her looking and waved eagerly. The princess of friendship then summarized her extensive thoughts on the matter.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We have realized that only Ditzy can save us all since Tirek would never expect her. All right every pony, transfer your magic now,&quot; Princess Celestia lowered her horn along with the other princesses. Even though she was performing the motions and the magic transference spell, Twilight still felt the need to comment of the situation.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; said the lavender unicorn as her magic mixed with the other alicorns and then barreled right into Ditzy.</p><p class="double">When the light faded, Ditzy stood tall as an alicorn. Her muffin shaped tiara did kind of ruin the image. The mail-mare oohed and aah-ed as she examined as much of her new self as she could before trotting off in search of a mirror, or possibly breakfast.</p><p class="double">With a great crashing noise, Tirek burst through the palace doors.</p><p class="double">Tossing the door fragments aside, he spoke to the tired looking alicorns in front of him, &quot;Good day, princesses. You know why I&#039;m here. Once I take your alicorn magic, I..&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a pale blue burst of magic that streaked in from where Ditzy was examining herself.</p><p class="double">And then suddenly, Tirek was a muffin.</p><p class="double">A normal sized muffin. Chocolate chip, if Twilight&#039;s nose was accurate.</p><p class="double">Twilight carefully spoke her mind on what had just occurred in front of her, &quot;Wait, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay! I won!&quot; Ditzy danced in place happily, &quot;Now to cast the spell to send all the stolen magic back to every po... oopsie. That was the muffin making spell again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight watched the spell shoot out a nearby window. Derpy raced forward and stared after her wayward spell. A brief burst of magic and Luna&#039;s telescope was now in front of Ditzy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry. It didn&#039;t hit any pony. Just Twilight&#039;s library. Oh, and Pinkie Pie was just passing by,&quot; Ditzy gave a play-by-play commentary, &quot;Oh no. Sorry your house got eaten, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle just made a weak squeaking noise as she lay there with her eyes closed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The princess of the sun shook her head, &quot;You misunderstand me, Twilight. I plan to have all of us give our alicorn magic to her.&quot;</p><p class="double">There stood Pinkie Pie, in all her cheery glory.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, he&#039;ll never expect her,&quot; Twilight preempted her mentor, &quot;All right, let&#039;s do this.&quot;</p><p class="double">A short magic transfer sequence later, and Pinkie was an alicorn. The pink pony was practically vibrating with energy. Pink sparks arced up and down her body in a way that seriously worried Twilight.</p><p class="double">Then Tirek burst in. The villain took a moment to look at the scene in front of him, &quot;So this was your plan, princess? It&#039;s too bad for you that I&#039;m quite capable of stealing the alicorn magic from this new inexperienced princess you had been hanging your hopes on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you don&#039;t need to steal anything,&quot; Pinkie Pie smiled the smile of an all-powerful party alicorn, &quot;If you want all my powers, I can just give them to you. Would that cheer you up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek grinned, &quot;Nothing would make me happier.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, okie dokie lokie,&quot; Pinkie chirped and lowered her new horn. Among the feeble protestations of the other princesses, Twilight watched onwards as Tirek absorbed all of Pinkie Pie&#039;s magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Finally!&quot; the magic thief roared, &quot;With all of your magic, Equestria shall be mine to party!&quot;</p><p class="double">The centauroid looked confused at what he had just said, &quot;I said, Equestria shall be partied to... Equestira shall fun party... Partyquestria party smile fun party. What the fun is party wrong with me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight watched in amazement as Tirek&#039;s fur turned a bright pink color.</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; the monster was in full panic mode, &quot;I will not fun this party indignity! I will sooner joy than party on like this! Party party fun joy.. Joy party... Fun fun fun time party!&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek horns were now striped like candy canes and his hooves had pictures of balloons on them. The magic thief started shooting pink beams of magic everywhere, futilely trying to get the tainted energies out while screaming out party words in fear and anger. Twilight watched sadly as one of the pink beams struck her doomed library, turning it into a delicious chocolate statue that started to melt under the heat almost immediately.</p><p class="double">Finally tired of running in circles, Tirek just fell onto the floor and curled up in the fetal position.</p><p class="double">The color faded Pinkie walked up to him, &quot;Do you want to give back all the pony magic you have taken now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek nodded pitifully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well then,&quot; Pinkie Pie nodded, then thought for a moment, &quot;I have absolutely no idea how to make that happen.&quot;</p><p class="double">The party pony thought some more and then gave a wide smile, &quot;What if it&#039;s like a pinata? All the magic will rush out like candy once we bust him open with large sticks?&quot;</p><p class="double">Upon hearing that, something far less magical escaped the newly panicking Tirek. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">100.10 (Bardic_Knowledge)</p><p class="double">Twilight Woke up in her usual book-reading spot, but instantly noted that something was off. It was night out, and she had been reading to the light of her horn. A quick scan of both book and memory pegged this to be a rather curious Variant Loop, wherein the ruler of Equestria was Tirac, Lord of the Night Sky, and the banished sibling was not Scorpan, as she expected (Prince Scorpan did show up in her memories, however, as her old foal-sitter), but Tir<i>ek</i>, Lord of Sunlight, whose corrupted self was known as King Sunstar.</p><p class="double">That brought up some rather unpleasant memories of the Fused Loop they&#039;d had with Mega Man.</p><p class="double">Considering the motivations of Tirac during their G1 Loops, she was somewhat worried the night sky meant he had brought about his &quot;night that never ends,&quot; but double-checking her memories revealed that, in this version of Equestria, everypony was actually nocturnal. This meant that Tirek&#039;s rebellion was motivated by the same thing that Luna&#039;s had been, so hopefully the Elements would still work on him without resorting to the inverse beam they&#039;d had to use on Tirek Sunstar. Further, this Lord Tirac may have been intimidating and a fairly harsh taskmaster in comparison to the more motherly Princess Celestia, but he was still a good guy in this Loop.</p><p class="double">Checking the Elements showed that only one of each Element was awake this time. She&#039;d have to contact each in turn until she could be sure who all it was, but maybe they&#039;d like an almost-baseline run this time around.</p><p class="double"><i>I wonder if someone&#039;s replaced Discord, too? Catrina, maybe?</i> she thought. <i>And please, please, </i>please <i>don&#039;t let Sunstar blow up my library at the start of the Loop.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight burst into the library as normal, calling for Spike. From his response, she could tell he wasn&#039;t Awake, nor had minor events (like Moondancer, her party, or Spike&#039;s crush) changed due to the change in leadership. She did her baseline search, changing her terminology from &quot;Mare in the Moon&quot; to &quot;Lord in the Stars.&quot; A similar letter was written and sent off, but the reply was rather different.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Twilight Sparkle,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I see I was not mistaken in choosing you as my pupil. My brother is expected to return on the Longest Night and I will be there to face him. I have long learned, however, to set up contingencies. In case I fail to stop him, as unlikely as it seems, I am tasking you with the retrieval of the Elements of Harmony from the Ancient Castle. None are allowed to know you have this task. As such, you have been given a cover as &quot;overseer&quot; of the celebration.</i></p><p class="double"><i>You know what will happen if you fail.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Lord Tirac of the Night Sky.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I guess we&#039;re going to Ponyville, then,&quot; concluded Spike. &quot;Hopefully there&#039;s enough time that we can say good-bye to our brothers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight double-checked her Loop memories. Rather than Lord Tirac raising Spike, as Celestia had during the baseline, Prince Scorpan had taken care of the young dragon. They had settled on a sibling relationship once Spike had become more independent, and Scorpan and Shining Armor had become fast friends.</p><p class="double">Oh. <i>More than... Heh. Scorpan and Shiny. Cadence will love that.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right, Spike. I&#039;m honoured Lord Tirac has entrusted me with this task, but remember what he said: Don&#039;t tell anyone what he&#039;s sent us to do.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike saluted and set about packing for their trip to Ponyville. She set out to find Shining, both to check if he was Awake and to tell him the news.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Going around Ponyville confirmed that the other Elements she had felt awake were the original set, and they gave each other subtle clues to keep things mostly baseline. Rarity&#039;s decorations were more malevolent in appearance and Fluttershy&#039;s bird choir was made up of various owls, but, considering the differences in this Equestria, that was understandable.</p><p class="double">She had no idea a snowy owl could keep the beat like that.</p><p class="double">The first major change came as everyone was leaving Pinkie Pre-Longest-Night-Party Party. Instead of gathering inside the town hall, everyone waited outside of it, watching Canterlot in the evening sky for Lord Tirac&#039;s chariot to arrive.</p><p class="double">Which meant that everypony in Ponyville had an excellent view of Midnight Castle&#039;s tallest tower exploding.</p><p class="double">Beams of furious light and roiling darkness clashed against each other as Sunstar and Tirac battled in the distance, before Twilight turned from the crowd and ran for the Everfree Forest. Obviously, her friends noticed, and Spike started along side her, but he kept tripping at her side, not used to being up as long as he had. Realizing his predicament, Twilight picked Spike up and changed directions for the library.</p><p class="double">&quot;But Twilight, I c-&quot; he yawned, &quot;I can stay up! I can help you- Zzzzz.&quot; He probably wouldn&#039;t have dropped off quite that rapidly if she hadn&#039;t also cast a sleep spell on him, but this way she could speak more freely with the others. As they arrived at the library, flashes of eldritch power shining (or darkening) through the sky, they quickly gathered around the Elements of Harmony Reference Guide.</p><p class="double">&quot;Six Elements, five known, that hasn&#039;t changed. The names have, though. Deception, Ferocity, Sorrow, Ambition, and Suspicion,&quot; Twilight&#039;s brow furrowed. &quot;It doesn&#039;t say anything about location in this one, though we do know where to go.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity gasped, &quot;But, darling, isn&#039;t that-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The way we used the Elements in that Mega Man Loop? Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean the one I wasn&#039;t Awake for?&quot; Dash said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; nodded Twilight. &quot;But let&#039;s get moving. I don&#039;t want Sunstar to take out this library before I&#039;ve even moved in. Or accidentally take out the rest of Equestria while he&#039;s fighting Tirac.&quot; As they ran, Applejack saw fit to inform everyone of another change.</p><p class="double">&quot;Almost everypony believes in the Pony of Shadows this time &#039;round, though it&#039;s not a fragment of Sunstar&#039;s power or Lord Tirac&#039;s, just a monster of the forest. And they say that anypony who goes in never comes out <i>the same</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">Everypony nodded in response, already forming their own conclusion about the emphasized words.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The cliff that Nightmare Moon broke apart in the baseline was easy to get past without her interference, and the manticore remained sleeping, too. In fact, everything seemed <i>too</i> smooth until they emerged from pitch-black path into the clearing with the no-longer-scary trees. It was Rainbow Dash who noticed something was off first, when she realized that Pinkie wasn&#039;t pronking like she normally did. She sidled up to Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Psst. AJ,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I think something&#039;s up with Pinkie. She&#039;s not acting quite right.&quot; Applejack glanced over herself, and saw it, too.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I understand,&quot; Applejack replied, before moving over to Pinkie. This had to be done delicately. &quot;Hey, Pinkie Pie. You remember the last time we saw trees like this?&quot; The right answer would have been a reference to the previous baseline Loop they did together.</p><p class="double">&quot;Silly Applejack! Of course I do!&quot; Pinkie(?) giggled. &quot;It was that one night we had a party at Sweet Apple Acres! Apple Bloom wandered too close to the forest and-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m going to have to stop you there, faker,&quot; said Rainbow Dash. The fake Pinkie stopped dead as she noticed that the others had surrounded her.</p><p class="double">&quot;W-what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You see,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;we&#039;ve got some shields to keep our minds safe from anything that could even try to read them. All most ponies, or other, could get is some falsified memories we let them see.&quot; With a snarl and burst of green fire, the fake revealed herself to be a changeling.</p><p class="double">Before the changeling could pounce or flee, Fluttershy looked it straight in the eye and Stared deep into it.</p><p class="double">&quot;How dare you do something like this?&quot; she said, her voice quiet but forceful. &quot;We&#039;re here in this forest to stop the evil King Sunstar, and you think that&#039;s a good time to kidnap one of our friends?!&quot; The changeling whimpered. &quot;Now, you will take us to the <i>real</i> Pinkie Pie, or so help me...&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling nodded rapidly, then indicated a direction. Apparently this was a Loop where changelings couldn&#039;t speak Equestrian in their true form. The others kept a circle around the changeling as it guided them with gestures and clicks. It seemed that, as they got closer, the changeling was getting worse and worse, occasionally holding its hoof to its mouth like it was going to throw up. Only a few feet from the edge of the river clearing where the sea serpent lived, it finally seemed to just give up and fall unconscious. At that point, though, they had no need for the guide.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie!&quot; cried Rainbow, as she sped towards the straight-maned pink form before her. Surrounding her was five more fallen changelings.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dashie!&quot; replied Pinkie, her hair poofing instantly back to it&#039;s normal shape as she turned around. Rainbow stopped just short of the hug, which confused Pinkie slightly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who lives in the river?&quot; she asked. Pinkie instantly understood.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we never really got his name, partly &#039;cause it changes from time to time, but most of the time he&#039;s called Steven Magnet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is you!&quot; cheered the group, as they shared a group hug.</p><p class="double">When the hug ended, Twilight asked, &quot;But Pinkie, how did you manage this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, after we came out of the dark part of the forest, I noticed they were acting more energetic than you guys normally do and when I talked to them, they asked me to tell them some funny jokes. Well, the more I laughed, the more they acted funny, so I tried something different: I thought of every day I missed you, whenever it wasn&#039;t actually you Looping, or those times I was isolated and alone in a Fused Loop, and they started acting sick. Kind of like Mazoku when you&#039;re having a really good day, really.&quot; Pinkie giggled. &quot;Anyways, I kept up the sad thoughts until they were knocked out, and then you guys showed up!&quot; Pinkie re-initiated the hug.</p><p class="double">After a few more moments of basking in their friendship, they continued onward.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t long before they found the Ancient Castle of the Lords, a far more ornate bridge than the simple (and broken) rope bridge from the baseline crossing the gap. But what brought them up short was the massive network of organic tunnels and walls that surrounded the bridge, from which emerged a swarm of changelings that quickly surrounded them.</p><p class="double">Feigning fear, the Loopers stood flank-to-flank, watching the swarm around them. When several of them adopted their forms, however, Rarity gasped in delight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my word! How marvellous! Tell me, my dear,&quot; the Fluttershy-looking changeling Rarity approached looked quite confused, &quot;can all of you do this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, yes?&quot; replied the Flutterchangeling.</p><p class="double">&quot;And- Are you restricted to pre-existing forms, or can you turn into whatever you want?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, um.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why do you ask?&quot; retorted a familiar voice from the hive around the bridge. Rarity turned to see Queen Chrysalis emerge from the main entrance, looking at her intently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, if you could look like just about anything, imagine the dresses you could model!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dresses? What use would we have for dresses?! All we need to survive is love. Clothing is entirely unnecessary.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my dear, don&#039;t you know just how much models are loved in Equestria? Why, if you were to, say, model some of my designs—well, it doesn&#039;t have to be you specifically, it could be any of you at all—you could become one of the most beloved figures in all of Equestria!&quot; That got a few looks and murmurs from the swarm as they considered the idea. Chrysalis looked intently at Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;And what do <i>you</i> get out of it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I did say model some of <i>my</i> dresses, did I not? I sew, you model. I get all the money, and you get all the love you ever need.&quot; Chrysalis definitely looked intrigued now. They continued negotiations, the swarm of changelings discussing the situation as well, and it took all the political savvy Rarity had picked up from her politician Loops and her Loops as the Changeling Queen (or, on occasion, both) to hammer out an iron-clad contract that ensured everyone would walk away from this deal satisfied.</p><p class="double">With a cheer and a promise of a &quot;Congratulations On The New Job&quot; party from Pinkie, the party headed for the castle. It was almost indistinguishable from the Ancient Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters, including the pedestal holding the petrified Elements. It was at that moment that King Sunstar smashed through the roof of the ceiling, a flaming crown between his horns and a malevolent grin on his face, looking up on at the lightening sky, as the sun overtook the moon, which now bore the face of Tirac.</p><p class="double">&quot;My brother seems to have forgotten that I can devour his magic. Perhaps a thousand years on his precious Moon will teach him to respect me,&quot; he gloated to himself. He then looked down at the ponies in front of him. &quot;What&#039;s this? Is this what my brother has sent to stop me?&quot; Sunstar began laughing uproariously.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right, King Sunstar!&quot; declared Twilight. &quot;And I know exactly how to stop you!&quot;</p><p class="double">This declaration seemed to make Sunstar laugh even harder. &quot;<i>You?!</i> How is an insignificant pony supposed to stop me? Even six of you are barely worth my time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We can stop you, with the Elements of Harmony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Sunstar stopped laughing at that. &quot;My brother would <i>never</i> tell anyone about them!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well he told me! Noticing that something was off with a member of our group that had been replaced by a changeling, Rainbow Dash represents the Element of Suspicion!&quot; An orb lifted off the pedestal to float over Rainbow Dash&#039;s head, glowing a dark red.</p><p class="double">&quot;Having tricked that changeling into revealing itself with the truth, Applejack represents the Element of Deception!&quot; An orb lifted off the pedestal to float over Applejack&#039;s head, glowing a dark orange.</p><p class="double">&quot;In coercing that changeling into leading us to our friends, Fluttershy represents the Element of Ferocity!&quot; Another orb, this one glowing an odd dark pink, approached Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">&quot;By missing us, Pinkie Pie poisoned the changelings trying to capture her, making her the Element of Sorrow!&quot; A blue orb floated to Pinkie. Twilight was very glad narrative causality kept Sunstar from attacking while she made her speech.</p><p class="double">&quot;Having persuaded the changelings into a deal that would help further her business and benefit them as well makes Rarity the Element of Ambition!&quot; This orb was an almost black shade of purple.</p><p class="double">Sunstar snarled, &quot;Even if you know those Elements, you can&#039;t know the last one. My brother never even told me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s exactly how I know it! Information is power, so keeping information to yourself gives you more power over those who don&#039;t know it, and it is that secret information that forms the Element of Magic!&quot; A burst of dark violet light manifested an orb over her head, and with a burst of power, a twisted rainbow of darkness emerged from the Element bearers and crashed down upon their foe, knocking everyone unconscious.</p><p class="double">Waking up sometime later, Twilight and the others looked upon the fallen and weakened form of Tirek. As the sun set again, a burst of darkness at the back of the hall revealed Lord Tirac, looking down upon his brother.</p><p class="double">&quot;You have failed in your coup again, brother. I am disappointed. It was you who persuaded me that my everlasting night was no better than Discord&#039;s random day cycle.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek groaned as he stood on his hooves. With a cough, he replied, &quot;I apologize, brother. I was blinded by jealousy as our subjects ignored my sun for your stars. Can you accept me back?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can. However, you will be kept in the care of my adopted nephew Scorpan until you can move your sun on your own again.&quot; Tirek bowed in acceptance of his sentence, and Tirac turned back to the gathered ponies. &quot;Once again you have validated my faith in you, Twilight Sparkle. And who are these others I see beside you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight bowed, &quot;These, Lord Tirac, are my allies. As I sought to fulfil your orders, they followed me of their own volition. Without their assistance, I would likely have been lost to the changelings that dwelled within the forest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then you and your allies are to be honoured. Once festivities have been completed in Ponyville and Midnight Castle has been rebuilt, we shall grant each of your allies a knighthood, and you shall be dubbed Baronetess Twilight of Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You honour us, my lord.&quot; Tirac nodded solemnly before transporting all of them back to Ponyville with a wave of his hand and a brief burst of darkness. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
