<p>26.1</p><p class="double">“You look a bit down,” a voice said.</p><p class="double">Gilda looked to one side, and saw a blue unicorn slide into the seat next to her.</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” she said, going back to her drink. “I just can’t connect with Dash.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that’s hardly surprising…” the blue unicorn said. “I mean, she’s not Looping this time.”</p><p class="double">Gilda’s head snapped around. “What?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, don’t try and cover it up…” the unicorn winked. “You’re not bad as actors go, but my special talent is half about misdirection. I’m Trixie Lulamoon, by the way. I was actually one of the newbies until you showed up.”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “Besides, you hardly look like a local. Ponyville does grow on you if you give it time, but…”</p><p class="double">Trixie held up a hoof. The red stallion running the bar slid over a glass of something fizzy and apple scented.</p><p class="double">“…you’re not a regular,” she finished. “Actually, on that front, how are you finding it here?”</p><p class="double">The griffin tried to assimilate everything that had just happened. “Er… not half bad, actually. Best drink I’ve had in a while, anyway.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “Hear that, Mac?”</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded.</p><p class="double">“This is kinda a new thing – a few centuries old,” Trixie said, then winced. “Sorry, that was probably a bit tactless of me.”</p><p class="double">“You think?” Gilda shook her head again. “This whole thing is difficult to cope with.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you’ll always be welcome here.”</p><p class="double">“Stop makin’ promises for me, Trixie,” Mac said amiably, “or you’ll make one ah wouldn’t have made mahself… one day.”</p><p class="double">“Not today, though,” Trixie shot back. “Anyway, Mac’s kind of doing this to help loopers like you – ones who just need a bit of relaxation, you can talk to him about anything. He’s really in demand when loopers from other worlds come in, ‘cause they’re usually from places a lot more, well, violent than our own.”</p><p class="double">“I wouldn’t mind that…” Gilda said, ruefully. “A bit of excitement, I mean.”</p><p class="double">Trixie’s eyes lit up. “Really? You like excitement? Loud bangs, adrenaline, intense risk?”</p><p class="double">Gilda nodded, almost against her will. “Yeah, that does sound pretty good right now…”</p><p class="double">“Trixie will give you excitement!” With a flash, a hat and cape materialized on the blue unicorn. “Come on, let’s go!”</p><p class="double">“Go where?” Gilda asked, reasonably.</p><p class="double">“That’s not the important bit! It’s the journey, not the destination.” Trixie paused. “Though at this point I think the destination should probably be King Sombra’s treasury.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Shining Armor and Princess Cadence walked warily into the palace of the Crystal Empire, on the look out for the evil being who had once taken it over.</p><p class="double">“Dear,” Cadence asked after a moment, “why are there so many suits of armour lying around ripped to bits?”</p><p class="double">“No idea,” Shining admitted. “They look like they got ripped to bits… and that one seems to have been struck by lightning.”</p><p class="double">“Should we wait for your sister and her friends?” Cadence shrugged. “I don’t know how dangerous this might be…”</p><p class="double">“No,” Shining replied after a moment. “If worst comes to worst, we can always teleport out.”</p><p class="double">They both heard the singing at the same moment.</p><p class="double">Shining built a charge on his horn. Cadence, still thinking a little like a pegasus, took off to be ready to ambush whoever might attack her husband.</p><p class="double">“…with a snail if you slow to a crawl,” two drunken voices shouted. “But the hedgehog-”</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Shining said, squinting. “Isn’t that… hey!”</p><p class="double">The singing stopped.</p><p class="double">“You, the blue unicorn,” Shining continued, “Aren’t you Trixie? Twilight’s friend?”</p><p class="double">“I am indeed,” Trixie replied, bowing deeply. Her hat fell off. “I am indeed Trixie Lulamoon. Queen Trixie!”</p><p class="double">“Pardon?” Shining asked, looking at Cadence for any kind of support she might be able to give. She shrugged helplessly, lowering herself slowly to the floor.</p><p class="double">Her companion pointed at the battered crown on top of Trixie’s head. “See? She’s queen ‘cause she beat up the king. That’s how it works,” she added with the assurance of the deeply sloshed, and looked owlishly at the empty bottle she was carrying in her right foreleg. “Hey, your majesty?”</p><p class="double">No response.</p><p class="double">“That’s you,” the griffin added, elbowing Trixie, who gave a start.</p><p class="double">“Yes! Me. What was it, lord high… thingy… Gilda?”</p><p class="double">“We ran out of spoils of victory again.”</p><p class="double">Trixie looked downcast. “Maybe one of these times we’ll get our spoils of victory out of the building before drinking it all.”</p><p class="double">Cadence plucked the bottle out of Gilda’s grip. “This is one of the bottles from the royal reserve, down in the dungeons.”</p><p class="double">Shining gaped. “You mean… they really <i>did</i> defeat Sombra?”</p><p class="double">“It was <i>so</i> cool,” Gilda said, with gestures. “Trix went kind of glowy and then grew wings, and then magicked him so hard it collapsed a wall on him.”</p><p class="double">“Wings?” Shining and Cadence exchanged a glance.</p><p class="double">“Hey, you want this?” Trixie asked, pulling the Crystal Heart out of her fallen hat. “I don’t want it, but it’s shiny.”</p><p class="double">Cadence’ eyes widened.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Shining said quickly. “And in return, we’ll do all the admin and paperwork associated with your position.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Trixie blinked, then snatched the crown off her head. “Paperwork, ew. I didn’t know it came with paperwork. You want it, Gilda?”</p><p class="double">“No chance!” Gilda warded Trixie off.</p><p class="double">“Ah well.” Trixie drop-kicked the crown into the distance. “Shall we go get some more spoils of war?”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good!”</p><p class="double">Trixie wrapped them both in magic, and they vanished.</p><p class="double">Shining looked at where they’d been for a moment. “…well, that sorted itself out.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Trixiiie?” Gilda moaned through a blinding headache, “Why did we do this again?”</p><p class="double">“Because you need to learn awesome on your own!” Trixie said, then winced. Flaring her horn, she applied an anti-hangover spell, which took the edge off. “Dash is pretty cool, yeah, but you can’t define yourself around her. You need to be your own, er, griffin.”</p><p class="double">She winked. “Besides, now <i>you</i> have a cool story to tell <i>her.</i>”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">26.1 omake (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">(This one may or may not slot in perfectly, but it would have to go here if it did.)</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Gilda! I heard about the way you beat on King Sombra. Awesome!&quot; Rainbow Dash called out.</p><p class="double">The bleary eyed griffon just groaned and pulled the cloud she was lying in around and over herself, trying to escape the rays of Celestia&#039;s sun and the overly cheery voice of her best friend, though right now she was thinking equicidal thoughts about her. The groan was a mistake, as it was a signal for the pain in various parts of her body to spawn hundreds of lesser pains which then moved out and took apartments in new parts of her body. Nomadic buffalo photons stampeded down her optic nerve and headbutted her brain, intensifying the Rainboom class headache that was already there. Her mouth tasted like a graveyard which had been used by a rave venue by the incontinent... she was hung-over, no, she was HUNG-OVER. Gahhh, Even thinking in capital letters hurt, and so did the tips of her feathers, that shouldn&#039;t even be possible!</p><p class="double">Griffons had the constitution of a buffalo, or rather buffaloes had the constitution of a griffon, but she and Trixie had drunk about half a cellar of King Sombra&#039;s private reserve. Crystal berry wine was sweet, fragrant with a wonderful undertone of honeysuckle and chocolate, and had a kick like an earth-pony on steroids, and that was before it had a thousand years to mature and increase in potency in a high magic environment. So it wasn&#039;t just a hang-over, it was a magic hang-over, and even Trixie&#039;s magic had only served to ease the pain.</p><p class="double">A vial flumped in the cloud beside her. &quot;Here, drink up! This is a little something Apple Bloom whipped up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;uuuhh. Is it poison? Something quick and painless would go down well right now.&quot; At least Dash was being slightly quieter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh, hang-over cure. Guaranteed to move that thunderhead of a hang-over, or your thunderhead cheerfully refunded.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda snatched it up and popped the cork with a claw-tip, then gulped it down. There was no way it could make her condition worse, at any rate. It fizzed over her tongue in a peculiar way, and then she felt as if some-pony had stuck a hose in her mouth and turned it on full blast, and water was shooting out of every pore in her body. She swelled up like a balloon and popped, and when she recovered, the pain was gone. In fact, she was ready to fight dragons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa! Now that is what I call a cure! Who is this Apple Bloom, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Earth-pony looper. Kid sister of my friend Applejack. She&#039;s been learning Zebra potion magic for… a lot of loops, so she knows what she&#039;s doing. She makes them for Mac&#039;s Cafe Equestrian. Twilight is taking one to Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh? You&#039;re Awake?&quot; Gilda did a double take.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, not every-pony Wakes at the start of a loop, sometimes it doesn&#039;t happen till much later, though it&#039;s pretty rare. Gotta admit, you and Trixie teaming up? Never have figured it, but it makes a lot of sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not mad?&quot; Gilda asked, shocked at the warmth she heard in Dash&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shrugged, shaking her head. &quot;Having other friends doesn&#039;t make your best friendship less... best. I&#039;d be pretty hypocritical if I got mad over you being friends with other ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda chuckled. &quot;I never thought I&#039;d hear Rainbow Dash use the word &#039;hypocritical&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash joined in. &quot;Yeah... Blame it on the time I looped into a world where Daring Doo was real. I know because I was her. Heh, if ever a loop taught me that being an athelete and an egg-head weren&#039;t mutually exclusive that was the one. That pony was in Twilight&#039;s league, but bucked flank like us...&quot;</p><p class="double">She saw Gilda&#039;s face fall slightly. &quot;Hey, buck up, you&#039;ll get your own awesome adventures now that you&#039;re loopy. What I was saying is friendship isn&#039;t a limited thing. The more you have, the more you get, and the more you can share. Speaking of sharing, I was looking you up to share some awesome with you. How&#039;d you like to learn how to do a Sonic Rainboom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re serious?&quot; Gilda&#039;s eyes widened.</p><p class="double">&quot;No I&#039;m Rainbow Dash... sorry Hogwarts joke... oh pony-feathers, we&#039;ve got a <i>lot</i> of catching up to do. Time for a pop-corn memory session with Apple Bloom&#039;s way-back machine after this. It can read a person&#039;s memories and play them back like a movie. It&#039;ll prepare you if you ever end up in the same places, which seems likely.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought you said she was all about potions?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s just a sideline, she&#039;s been looping for a long time, and it turns out her talent is putting together really cool tech. She&#039;s been in lots of fused loops where things are pretty much science fiction, and learned how to use it. Hmmm... I think we&#039;ll start you on an X-Wing, it&#039;s robust and fairly easy to get the hang of... that&#039;s if you want to learn how to pilot a space fighter. Or maybe a giant robot. Or we can get her to fit you with thruster boots and an atmosphere containment harness and the two of us can take a trip around the moon...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa!&quot; Gilda&#039;s feathers were toinging out a bit. &quot;I... ahh...&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash face-hooved. &quot;Nice going Rainbow Crash! Sorry Gilda, I&#039;m doing it again. You need to adjust to the loops at your pace, not be forced into anything you aren&#039;t ready for. It&#039;s just... I have so many cool things I want to share with you, and I want to do it right now! Look, for the rest of this loop, you set the pace. You want to learn how to do a Sonic Rainboom? Fine. Want to try and get into the Wonderbolts Academy with me? We can do that. Want to just spend the time playing cloudball, surfing the air-currents and kicking back on a cloud while listening to rocking tunes? I&#039;m good with that too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That last one sounds real good...&quot; Gilda said, watching for any sign of disappointment in her friend&#039;s eyes. There was none, only concern for her friend, and she remembered Twilight&#039;s words. Then she made a decision. &quot;But learning a Sonic Rainboom sounds good too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash punched the air with a hoof. &quot;Yes! We are going to have so much fun!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>26.2</p><p class="double">“Twilight, you need to go and retrieve the Element of Magic from-”</p><p class="double">Twilight closed her eyes and concentrated. With a flash of light, her Magic tiara rematerialized on her brow. “Done. What now?”</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked. “Since when could you do that?”</p><p class="double">“It’s been a while.” Twilight shrugged. “You were saying?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, nothing.” Celestia got a little smile on her face. “Excuse me, I need to go nail this mirror to the ceiling of a prison cell.”</p><p><hr></p><p>26.3</p><p class="double">The Mayor pointed. “Who is that masked figure?”</p><p class="double">Dash followed her gaze, and grinned. “Oh, right, that’s the Mysterious Mare-Do-Well. I ran into her once.”</p><p class="double">The silhouette spread wings and took off, flaring a horn to launch a bolt of ice almost directly at the crowd.</p><p class="double">“Whoah!” Dash ducked along with the rest of them, and the bolt splashed off a shield made out of plants.</p><p class="double">From inside the shield, a second figure emerged clad head-to-toe in bright forest green. The new pony spread wings and leapt into the air, trees growing from the rooftops as support.</p><p class="double">“Hmm, that doesn’t seem right…” Dash said. She bent down next to the mayor. “That’s I Be Leaf. I’ve not seen her like this before…”</p><p class="double">The blue pegasus tapped her chin. “Hang on a second. I’m gonna go have a look.”</p><p class="double">She shot upwards, then returned to the ground. “Thought so.”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” the mayor asked, worried.</p><p class="double">“Well, I saw…” Dash counted them off. “Sir George the Dragon, a magic user who might have been Madam Magpie, and the Felicitous Fillies. I think Ponyville might have a superhero infestation. Nothing major, just a Crossover Event.”</p><p class="double">A pony wearing a red and black outfit and carrying a boffer sword ran up a nearby wall, seemingly having an argument with itself. Another wearing clothes made like shimmering water rode past on a waterspout, and then a pair of gigantic wings blotted out the sun.</p><p class="double">“Huh…” Dash blinked. “Maybe I was wrong. That looks like a Crisis Crossover. Everypony down!”</p><p class="double">There was a bright flash, and all the battling costumed ponies vanished.</p><p class="double">“What just happened?” Roseluck asked, looking around.</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged. “I think that was a Cosmic Retcon. The whole storyline got too complicated, so it just stopped.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Well, that went well!” Dash said later. “The Mayor was certainly confused…”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Applejack said, sourly, “but it woulda been good if you’d come up with a better superhero type for me. Ah had to be th’ Mare-Do-Well.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, at least you could do all of it at once…” Dash shrugged. “And I think it’d be nice if we perhaps used all of these superhero identities in some other loop.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I can <i>certainly</i> store the costumes until then,” Rarity said cheerfully. “Perhaps we could work out something for you?”</p><p class="double">“Ah’d prefer if ah got to use these,” AJ replied, summoning her Ember Celica from a subspace pocket. “They ain’t used as often as ah’d like.”</p><p class="double">Rarity’s eyes glittered. “One Punch? Hmmm…”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Well, good to know it was funny. And yes, using those costumes again would be nice. Perhaps we could try the whole secret identity thing?”</p><p class="double">“That sounds good,” Fluttershy said quietly.</p><p class="double">“Speak for yourself!” Pinkie said, grinning. She hadn’t taken off her Deadpool-inspired costume yet, and all indications were that she’d just wear it for the rest of the Loop.</p><p><hr></p><p>26.4</p><p class="double">Rarity trotted into the cavern, wearing one of her best dresses. “Hello, mister dragon? I have a business proposition for you.”</p><p class="double">The dragon growled.</p><p class="double">“Here it is,” she said, nonchalantly sitting down on the edge of his hoard. “I take items from your hoard and enchant them, making them much more valuable. Then, I go and sell them, and you get gold and jewels equal to the value of the initial investment plus one half of the profits.”</p><p class="double">“And why should I trust you, pony?” The huge beast sounded almost amused. “This is a transparent ploy to walk off with my most prized possessions.”</p><p class="double">“No, not really…” Rarity shook her head. “You do insult me, sir. I assure you, this is no ploy.” She paused. “Really, must you be stuck in the First Diarchy era? You have to make your gold work <i>for</i> you.”</p><p class="double">“I find it works quite well as a bed. Now, leave before I flame you out,” he said with finality.</p><p class="double">Rarity examined a bracelet. “You know, this would look lovely on a mantelpiece…”</p><p class="double">The dragon inhaled, then let out a jet of flame.</p><p class="double">Lightning-quick, Rarity swept the top layer off her dress and flung it at the dragon’s mouth. “Solute!”</p><p class="double">The gossamer-fabric quivered, then exploded into at least thirty tonnes of salty water. Dragon’s fire met instant wave, and the whole cavern filled with pleasant sea-scent and steam.</p><p class="double">“Ah, lovely,” Rarity said, sniffing the air. “Oh, are you alright?”</p><p class="double">The dragon coughed. “Some of that went up the wrong way!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I am sorry.” She shrugged. “But, well, it proves my bona fides, does it not?”</p><p class="double">There was a silence.</p><p class="double">“…you said two thirds, didn’t you?”</p><p class="double">“For shame!” Rarity kicked the floor. “I am an artisan, not a day labourer! One third.”</p><p class="double">“That is robbery!” Snarls echoed in the confined of the cave, though the effect was spoiled by a cough. “Sixty percent.”</p><p class="double">“Forty-five.”</p><p class="double">“Fifty, then, curse you.”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled broadly. “It’s a deal.”</p><p class="double">The dragon grumbled something about banditry by another name. </p><p class="double">“Oh, hush,” the unicorn replied. “It’s not as though you’re the only person around here with jewellery, you know.”</p><p><hr></p><p>26.5</p><p class="double">“And who do you have for us to listen to?” Cheerilee asked, after everyone was done applauding Granny Smith’s story.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Scootaloo said, and paused. “Does it just have to be a parent or whatever?”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee considered. “It can be a close family friend, if that’s what you mean.”</p><p class="double">“I more meant… biological. But that’s fine.” Scootaloo poked her head out the window. “It’s okay! Come on in!”</p><p class="double">In a blur of multicoloured light, Rainbow Dash skidded to a stop in the classroom.</p><p class="double">Well, almost to a stop.</p><p class="double">“I’m okay!” she shouted from inside the pile of books, to general laughter. “Er… little help here, squirt?”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo and several other fillies and colts dug her out of the collapsed bookcase.</p><p class="double">“Right,” Dash said, preening self-importantly and trying to look like that hadn’t happened, “basically, I’m really, really fast.”</p><p class="double">There was a long pause.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Dash?” Scootaloo stage-whispered.</p><p class="double">“Yeah?”</p><p class="double">“Little more than that?”</p><p class="double">“Okay, whatever.” Dash blew her mane out of her eyes. “So, how about I tell you mini-ponies the story of how I got my cutie mark?”</p><p class="double">As stories went, it was a pretty good one. Not quite as good as Granny Smith’s tale of the founding of Ponyville – every pony in the room could relate to that, whereas only the pegasi had some sense of just how insanely hard a Rainboom was – but Dash told it well, and there were some gasps when she described Fluttershy’s fateful fall. (Though, of course, it was fairly obvious that the pegasus was going to survive. After all, she was a common sight around town.)</p><p class="double">“Did you really break the sound barrier?” Silver Spoon asked, after Dash had finished. “That’s awesome!”</p><p class="double">Diamond didn’t join in the general approval, but given how nasty she could be Scootaloo considered it good enough that she had stopped trying to undermine the Crusaders.</p><p class="double">“Wait a second,” Diamond said, frowning.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo felt like rolling her eyes. <i>Spoke too soon.</i></p><p class="double">“Are you Scootaloo’s sister or something? If you’re so good at flying, how come she’s so terrible at it?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I am,” Dash said, so matter-of-factly and coming so close on the heels of the accusation that tears started in Scootaloo’s eyes. “We didn’t have the same parents, but she’s still my little sis. And who cares about being bad at flying?”</p><p class="double">Coming from a pony who had just described herself as the most awesome flier in existence, this drew a collective jaw drop.</p><p class="double">“…you know what I mean,” Dash added, blushing. “Anyway. Flying’s what I’m good at. Scoots is good at something else.”</p><p class="double">She thought for a second. “Hey, I have this theory… Scoots? Want to help me test something?”</p><p class="double">The younger pegasus looked up at her. “Let me guess. Terrifyingly dangerous, small chance of success, and pure awesome if it works.”</p><p class="double">“You know me too well,” Dash replied, winking.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was still a little nervous, but… well, Dash was old enough and experienced enough that this was at least partly an act. (After all, a crazy and awesome older sister was worth major kudos.)</p><p class="double">“Alright. I trust you.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“I take it baaaaack!” Scootaloo shouted, looking down at the ground miles below.</p><p class="double">Dash grinned. “Hey, this <i>is</i> totally safe.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo held on tighter to Dash’s rainbow mane.</p><p class="double">“…look,” the elder pony said, in a much more serious voice. “You <i>are</i> basically my sister. I meant what I said. And I <i>will</i> save you if this doesn’t work.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo gulped.</p><p class="double">“…okay.” Closing her eyes, she jumped.</p><p class="double">For a moment, she felt completely weightless. Then, as she accelerated, air resistance began to bite.</p><p class="double"><i>Crudcrudcrudcrud! What did Dash say? Air magic, right. Air magic.</i> Reaching out with her weak but well controlled air magic, Scootaloo began shaping the air stream around her to reduce the air resistance. Another thought hit her, and she began flapping her small wings as fast as she could.</p><p class="double">“You’re doing fine!” Dash shouted, easily keeping pace. Scootaloo felt vaguely insulted that her mentor was actually doing this while lying on her back.</p><p><hr></p><p>Halfway to the ground, Scootaloo was feeling overwhelmed.</p><p class="double">She was nearly as fast as she had to be, but somehow getting that little extra speed was beyond her. It was the kind of thing you needed full pegasus wings and strong pegasus magic for, not her half-developed adolescent version.</p><p class="double">The air she was shaping was useful, cutting through the atmosphere like a knife, but-</p><p class="double"><i>Wait!</i></p><p class="double">Like a knife. Or like a well designed fighter aircraft.</p><p class="double">Ideas clicked into place. Scootaloo reached out to her magic and twisted – taking the friction and using it to <i>heat</i> the air, rather than minimizing it.</p><p class="double">Another thought, and she funnelled that air through the main body of her wind cone, which began to flatten and develop distinctive wings. A slight alteration made it begin to spin.</p><p class="double"><i>Thank you, Lockheed-Martin!</i> Scootaloo thought, in the strange euphoria of an epiphany.</p><p class="double">Hot air contacted cold, and-</p><p class="double"><i>WOOSH.</i></p><p><hr></p><p>Every child from the school, even Diamond Tiara, started cheering as the curtain of flame spread across the sky.</p><p class="double">A rainbow one formed behind it, and then Dash’s streak of multicoloured light caught up with a white one trailed by orange flame.</p><p><hr></p><p>“What the buck did you just <i>do</i>?” Dash asked, laughing hysterically as she kept pace with Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">“I think I just made a Blackbird out of weather magic,” Scootaloo replied in a distracted tone. “Hey, it’s about to fall apart ‘cause I can’t work out how to make it stop accelerating. Catch me?”</p><p class="double">“Always,” Dash promised, and, true to her word, plucked the filly out of the air as her fragile air-construct collapsed.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Huh…” Scootaloo said, dazed, and stared at her flank again.</p><p class="double">What was there was a kind of faded, gaseous aircraft-shape made from sonic boom shock clouds. It wasn’t the only cutie mark she’d had, not by a long chalk, but this one was… different, if only in that she’d managed it without any kind of artificial assistance.</p><p class="double">Applebloom hadn’t stopped laughing since Scootaloo had landed, except to point out between giggles that it was <i>so </i>typically Scootaloo to have no idea how to keep an aircraft in one piece.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo <i>had</i> tried to protest, but the engineer-filly had reminded her of at least three separate planes that had simply fallen to bits around her thanks to overzealous straining of the airframe.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle came to Scootaloo’s rescue. “Hey, ‘bloom? You do realize she’s completely stolen the show this time around?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom stopped laughing. “Aw… shucks.”</p><p class="double">“So,” Sweetie added, determined to get them all back to normal, “you going to repeat this way of getting your cutie mark?”</p><p class="double">“No!” Scootaloo replied, eyes twitching. “Not without at least two different kinds of safety gear.”</p><p class="double">“What, a helmet and shinpads?” ‘bloom snarked.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo considered it. “I was thinking more along the lines of the world’s biggest trampoline and a Pinkie Promise not to get hurt.”</p><p class="double">“…actually, that might do it,” Applebloom admitted.</p><p class="double">“Hey, this gives me an idea for a song!” Sweetie said.</p><p class="double">Grateful for the return to normalcy, both of the others threw pillows at her.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“…she did <i>what?</i>” Twilight asked. “No, I did hear you. I just didn’t believe you were that irresponsible.”</p><p class="double">Dash looked down. “Sorry, ‘twi. I was going to ascend to save her if I had to.”</p><p class="double">“I don’t doubt it.” Twilight tried a smile. “Just… careful, okay? Not everypony is as tough as you.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus nodded.</p><p class="double">Then her eyes widened, and she kicked the wall. “Oh, <i>buck!</i> I should have lent her my Element!”</p><p class="double">“Would that have worked?” Twilight asked, more to herself than anything. “I would have thought the cutie mark had to be established… oh, well.”</p><p class="double">Getting out a notebook, she wrote something in it. “You know this is one of the first times any Crusader has got a cutie mark based entirely off of in-loop actions? I mean, they’ve got ones before, but usually either when not Awake or when in a Loop somehow different to normal.”</p><p class="double">“Or they’ve made it a loop different to normal by building an aircraft or something…” Dash muttered. “Which is more or less what happened anyway.”</p><p class="double">“True, true…” Twilight acknowledged. “Okay, I think this one’s going to be a friendship lesson. By the end of the week, please.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus groaned. “Not again!”</p><p class="double">“Well, you <i>have</i> been a bit crazy these last few loops… perhaps you need to let some steam off…” Twilight frowned. “Wonder when the next giant robot loop is?”</p><p><hr></p><p>26.6</p><p class="double">“So,” Spike said, lying back in the warm sunlight of a new Loop’s second day, “what should we do this time?”</p><p class="double">“Not sure, really…” Rarity replied, trotting over with a huge towel. She laid it down next to him, making sure it completely covered the grass, then flopped down on it. Obligingly, Spike raised an arm and pulled the edge of the towel under his side.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” the dragon pondered for a moment. “Fancy a world tour?”</p><p class="double">“That might be nice.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Spike said, grinning. “I’d only suggested it for a bit of a laugh – are you sure it’s fine?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Rarity winked. “Just give me a day or so to set the shop up.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Ready?” Spike checked.</p><p class="double">“Of course.” The unicorn nodded down the road. “Come on – Manehattan awaits!”</p><p class="double">“Out of curiosity,” Spike said, as they got going – Loopers could travel light with the best of them, using their subspace pockets to hold luggage easily – “how <i>did</i> you get the shop set up?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I blagged an EMH off of Twilight. You know, the virtual doctor things from the Star Trek place. No AI,” she shrugged, “but it should be quite sufficient with a little reprogramming.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Hello?” the stallion said, looking nervous. “This is the Carousel Boutique, right?”</p><p class="double">With a flash, a unicorn mare appeared in front of him. Her face was composed, and she wasn’t quite focusing on him.</p><p class="double"><b>“Please state the nature of your fashion disaster.”</b></p><p class="double">“Er… well, I’m getting married tomorrow, and I don’t have a tuxedo-”</p><p class="double">The unicorn vanished. There was a shuffling sound from the back room, and then she reappeared in another flash of light.</p><p class="double">In her hooves was a neatly packaged suit.</p><p class="double"><b>“Price noted on the package. Please leave your details and feedback.”</b></p><p class="double">Feeling quite thoroughly creeped out, the stallion left his name, address and the money and left as fast as he could.</p><p class="double">The suit fitted perfectly.</p><p><hr></p><p>26.7</p><p class="double">“What is the meaning of this?” Blueblood said, looking down at a rather scruffy earth pony stallion. “Where is your ticket?”</p><p class="double">“I told you, I don’t <i>have</i> one,” the stallion replied. “Look, I never expected to need one, but-”</p><p class="double">“But me no buts!” Blueblood shook his head. “This is an invitation <i>only</i> event, and I do not intend to see the wedding of my cousin and her fiancé marred by any old nag off the street!”</p><p class="double">“Look, Blueblood, it’s me!” The stallion’s eyes pleaded. “I don’t know where my horn went, but it’s me. Shining Armor.”</p><p class="double">“Tosh!” Blueblood turned up his nose. “Captain Armor is a unicorn of great distinction and rather good breeding. You are some earth pony with a similar cutie mark, trying to con your way into the palace. Guards!”</p><p class="double">“What’s going on?” Cadence’s voice came from the direction of the grounds. “Is it Shiny? He’s ever so late, the sun’s gone down.”</p><p class="double">“It’s me, Cadence!” the stallion shouted, before Blueblood threw a silencing spell at him.</p><p class="double">Cadence flew over the last fence in the way with a little fluttering hop and slowed to a stop, eyes wide. “Oh!”</p><p class="double">“Please, cousin,” Blueblood’s tone softened. “I’m sorry all this hassle is affecting your wedding day, but this is just some tramp who tried to get into the palace under false pretences. Once this is sorted out, then I can see if I can find the Captain. I should have tried sooner.”</p><p class="double">“No,” Cadence said, her voice hitching and close to tears. “You’re wrong, cousin.”</p><p class="double">Her eyes met those of the stallion. “This <i>is</i> Shining Armor. I’d know him anywhere.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood’s reaction to that was, perhaps fortunately, composed of a coughing fit rather than words.</p><p class="double">“What happened to you, love?” she asked softly.</p><p class="double">Shining tried to speak, but no sound came out. After a moment, Cadence snapped the thread of Blueblood’s silence spell and he started in on the explanation.</p><p class="double">“It’s a curse,” he said, his clear voice carrying. “By night one way, by day another; this shall be the norm. Until you find true love’s first kiss; then, take love’s true form.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, Shining…” Cadence looked at him for a second longer, then darted forwards and kissed him.</p><p class="double">All the spectators covered their eyes against the blinding flash of light.</p><p class="double">“…huh,” Shining said after a moment, looking down the barrel of his body. “I don’t remember the wings from before.”</p><p class="double">Cadence sniffed. “You were always a prince in my eyes.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“…plagarists,” Trixie muttered, as the moonlit wedding finally got under way.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hush,” Twilight said, eating some popcorn. “So what if they stole the plot of Shrek?”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">26.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had a BRILLIANT plan this loop. She&#039;d filled her friends in on it, arranged various spell matrices in the Everfree, and just managed to get back in time for the summer sun celebration. On cue, Nightmare Moon appeared, looking down at the crowd of ponies and going into her speech.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now, the night! Will last! Forever!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked internally, opening her mouth--</p><p class="double">&quot;I wouldn&#039;t be doing that mate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">A strange brown stallion, mane and beard tied up in dreadlocks and beads, swaggered forward. He was wearing a roughshod sort of jacket and a ratty old tricorn, eyeing Nightmare Moon lazily. The goddess of the night gazed down at him dismissively.</p><p class="double">&quot;And who are <i>you</i> to oppose me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, nonono. Not opposing the night thing, really. I&#039;m just a humble sailor, stumbled into port for the Summer.... set thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...We&#039;re landlocked.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See, that&#039;s the problem. I&#039;m completely lost.&quot; The stallion waved around vaguely, half stumbling. &quot;Sailor, use the stars to navigate. Love those things, by the way, great lil&#039; pinpricks of light in the sky.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot; Rainbow whispered, &quot;should we do something?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shook her head slightly. &quot;I want to see how this goes...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! So you admit the virtue of the night!&quot; Nightmare Moon stamped a hoof. &quot;Thank you, noble sailor. Now then--&quot;&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you see the problem is... if it&#039;s night here, then what&#039;s it out at sea?&quot; The stallion held up a hoof. &quot;Not. Not night. Thing of it is, if you&#039;re out at sea and it&#039;s day, you&#039;re completely lost. Less you find land. But that only ensures you&#039;re a little less lost, less you find a map. You need a lot more equipment when it&#039;s not night, then when it&#039;s night. You see? I love the eternal night, but put it here, land locked, and when I get out to port I&#039;m not going to be able to see the stars, lass.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked. &quot;I... see thy reasoning, I suppose. Still--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Here&#039;s an idea. Let&#039;s make eternal night mobile.&quot; By now, the stallion had somehow stumbled onto the stage. &quot;You and me, and all us night lovers, we go round the sea. And all the day lovers stay here, on dry land, and grow things. Then, when we get hungry, we walk up, take what we can, and sail off.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thou refers to piracy!&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion considered her words. &quot;Hmm. Yes, I think that is the right word.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why would we engage in such acts against those whom we wish respect from?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why wouldn&#039;t you? I mean, isn&#039;t that what you&#039;re doing now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon looked genuinely shocked. &quot;No!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, so you&#039;re not asking for tribute?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No! Of course not!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, sorry then. I think I misinterpreted things.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Carry on with your hostile takeover, by all means.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tried hard to keep her face straight.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon gave the stallion a long, strange look.</p><p class="double">He tilted his head.</p><p class="double">She snorted, and turned back to the now quite bemused ponies. &quot;As we were saying, the night <i>will</i> last forever--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, I just realized something.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn growled, whirling on him. &quot;What?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think, maybe, the night lasts forever anyway. I mean, the moon keeps moving, and the sun keeps moving, and really the only difference is which is in the sky. So keeping the moon where it is sort of seems redundant to me. Of course, I&#039;m just a very lost sailor. Could be wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Twilight offered politely, &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;re right.&quot; She got a brown hoof wave.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what I&#039;m thinking is, keeping night here means that everybody else in the world, they end up not getting night. That doesn&#039;t seem fair to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon stared at him as if he was insane.</p><p class="double">&quot;Show of hands! Sorry. Show of hooves, who here thinks that the night is too wonderful to keep locked on one place?&quot;</p><p class="double">Everypony in the hall shot up a hoof, Pinkie flipping over so all of hers could dangle upward. Nightmare Moon choked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, see, all these ponies love night so much, they want to share it... with the world. So, back to my original suggestion. Keep the eternal night, but keep it moving. Savvy?&quot;</p><p class="double">The black alicorn stared at him. &quot;But... that&#039;s just the same thing as what there was before!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it?&quot; He blinked, glanced up at the sky, and turned back to her. &quot;I hadn&#039;t noticed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even Twilight wasn&#039;t sure if the stallion was being sarcastic.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon held up a hoof, trying to formulate an argument, but her mouth merely opened and shut in confusion. Finally, staring out at the crowd, she released a frustrated scream. &quot;FINE! Moving eternal night it is! But we&#039;re going to be watching closely and if we don&#039;t see proper respect for the night, we are going to stick Celestia back in the sun!&quot; With a flash of her horn, she was gone, and a moment later Celestia stepped onto the stage slightly confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.... hum. Well. That was... not... expected...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I rarely am, love.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehooved. Okay, time to host an intervention. Her horn glowed, teleporting the stallion and herself into the library; she had to figure out what the hay was going on.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...so this is your first time outside your home loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose it is.&quot; Jack shrugged. &quot;Leastways, this don&#039;t look like anywhere in the Caribbean. I take it you&#039;ve never heard of Davy Jones?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. Well, welcome to Equestria, enjoy your stay, and if you do anything to destabilize or threaten the world I teleport you straight to the moon.&quot; Twilight smirked. &quot;Other then that, you&#039;re pretty much free to do whatever, mister...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sparrow Jack.&quot; He blinked and shook his head. &quot;No, wait. Jack Sparrow. Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A pleasure to meet you captain. Oh, since it is your first time out of your loop, you&#039;ll need the Welcome to the multiverse speech. Oh I&#039;m so excited, this is my frist time giving it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Jack Sparrow suddenly felt a sinking feeling. </p><p><hr></p><p>26.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight woke up over a dead mouse. And realized part of it was in her.... beak?</p><p class="double">Okay so... owl, apparently. Alright, sure. Loop memories... this was still Equestria. Heck, she was in the Everfree forest...</p><p class="double">A suspicion rose up in her mind and she took to wing, headed for Ponyville.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah swear if you make any sort of pun Ah will punt you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity scoffed. &quot;My word, Applejack, do I look like the sort of feline that would make light of another&#039;s situation? I am a refined lady.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmdog nodded, managing a wry smile. &quot;Ah guess ya are... should be on the lookout fer Rainbow though. Wait a minute, if we&#039;re the pets this loop, then Rainbow--&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.&quot; Rainbow let out an irritated sigh. Twilight was a short distance away, hooting with laughter and rolling on the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, now,&quot; Fluttershy tried, &quot;It&#039;s not nice of you to laugh at Rainbow&#039;s expense Twi. After all, it... hee... she can&#039;t help that she&#039;s... hee hee... so slow!&quot; The rabbit tried and failed to hold back her own giggles.</p><p class="double">Dash looked between her two friends. Eventually, she just rolled her eyes and pulled back into her shell. &quot;Wake me up when Angel comes round to feed us.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie looked in the mirror.</p><p class="double">&quot;...well. Bright pink gator. This is one for the record books.&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; the bearer of Kindness asked his pet tortoise.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash nodded, snapping the goggles over her eyes and checking the straps on her prismatic shell.</p><p class="double">Tank let out a sigh, double checking the machinery once again before finally nodding. &quot;Alright then. Tortoise take off in ten.&quot; He backed off, ready to catch her with his magic should anything go wrong.</p><p class="double">Blades started to whirl, cutting the air with a powerful rumble as the various propellers attached to Dash kicked into gear. Soon enough, the only thing holding her to the ground were the metal struts clinging to the contraption. Tank took a breath, lighting his horn and sliding them away slowly.</p><p class="double">As soon as she was free, Rainbow bolted into the air, spiraling and twirling on her magitech glider jet copter thing and letting out a scream of pure joy. Rainbow Dash, fastest tortoise on the ground, was now once again the fastest thing in the air.</p><p class="double">The air over Ponyville, anyway. Even Tank&#039;s mechanical brilliance wasn&#039;t quite enough to give her supersonic speed. Yet.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d painted the contraption blue with yellow bolts, much to Tank&#039;s amusement. And by Celestia she was going to ensure that she made it.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah thought Ah was the pet in this relationship,&quot; Applejack grumbled to herself. But she couldn&#039;t help but smile as Winona emerged from a pile of apples and tumbled down to her paws. &quot;Come on, ya klutz, ya still need to get to the other trees.&quot;</p><p class="double">Winona didn&#039;t understand her, of course--well, she didn&#039;t understand what Applejack was <i>saying</i>, but the way she pointed toward the rest of the orchard with an orange paw communicated her intent clearly enough. &quot;Oh come on, you silly mutt, I&#039;m dog tired! Maybe I should go see if anypony&#039;s willing to lend a hoof.&quot; Her face scrunched up. &quot;On second thought, no, that would be GROSS. I&#039;ll just ask for their help.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack let out a whuffling chuckle. &quot;No wonder you got Laughter. That sounds like a right fine idea, girl, let&#039;s go corral us some ponies.&quot; Winona bounced up, beginning to walk off before Applejack bit down on her tail. &quot;AFTER you get all these apples into buckets, girl!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ow! Hey! Down dog!&quot; Winona turned around. &quot;What is it? What&#039;s wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">The orange mutt sighed, pointing at the apples.</p><p class="double">&quot;....you want to play fetch?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack facepawed.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Gummy....</p><p class="double">Gummy was a strange one. Everypony in Ponyville knew this. Yes, he gave freely, and often exactly what was needed. Heck, he was even the bearer of generosity! And yet....</p><p class="double">Some said it was his eyes. Some said it was his vacant expression. Some said it was the way the earth pony moved so silently, you couldn&#039;t hear his hoofsteps on hard cobble. Some, quietly, blamed the genetic quirk that prevented him from growing teeth and made the rare sound of his voice an oddity, though they would never say it out loud.</p><p class="double">All in all, something was... off about that pony. How did he know what you needed? Why did he crop up when you needed him, and just as suddenly disappear? Where did he get the stuff he gave, what was his job anyway? Yes, he hung out with his &quot;friends,&quot; but... he would smile, frown, and never open his mouth. Never even to eat! Although, given the tooth thing maybe he was just embarrassed.</p><p class="double">Strangest of all was his hot-pink alligator. She couldn&#039;t talk. No. She <i>sang.</i> And danced, but any animal could do that. The toothy grin almost permanent on her face was somehow heartwarming and endearing and not at all predatory. On occasion she even played with young foals; even stranger, if the parents got worried and tried to stop her she would nod and walk away, calmly, as if she understood.</p><p class="double">They were an odd pair, Gummy and Pinkie Pie, and nopony really quite understood them.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Opalescence smiled gratefully as Rarity brought up the appropriate gems. &quot;Thank you, darling. You&#039;ve quite a good taste, I wish I could make you an outfit.&quot; She sighed. &quot;If only you didn&#039;t have such long fur... Ah, well. Back to pleasing the idiots in Canterlot.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Should I take offense to that?&quot;</p><p class="double">The white unicorn turned to the brown pegasus walking in through the boutique door. &quot;You&#039;re not in Canterlot anymore, you&#039;re not an idiot at all, and I doubt princess Philomena would disagree with my assessment of the nobles... so I&#039;m going to say no. Why are you here, Owly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just warning you there&#039;s going to be a storm Tuesday.&quot; The pegasus shrugged. &quot;I wasn&#039;t aware if you had any important meetings, but I know that impressions are important.&quot;</p><p class="double">Opalescence nodded at him thankfully. &quot;I&#039;ll be sure to have a day in then. Thanks for the heads up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Part of Honesty is facts, and I felt I would be denying my element if I left you uninformed.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a mild chuckle out of her. &quot;Honestly, you try too hard. You don&#039;t see me casting spells left and right. By the way, could you tell Peewee his phoenix has been sneaking over here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Certainly. Has there been any issues?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, no, not exactly.&quot; The unicorn shuddered. &quot;It&#039;s just.... I... I think I spotted him making out with Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus raised a thick eyebrow. &quot;Truly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know what she sees in him--purple and green feathers, so gauche! And apart from that, she&#039;s a cat and he&#039;s a bird.&quot; Opal shuddered. &quot;Still, I guess I can&#039;t actually stop them without spaying her. Not going to do that. Angel gets really aggressive about things like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm, yes. Cloudsdale culture can do that. Very well, I&#039;ll try to get Peewee to reign Spike in, but I doubt he&#039;ll do it.&quot; Owly shook his head. &quot;That young dragon.... why did I EVER hatch him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You wanted an intellectual challenge and didn&#039;t actually expect your methods to work,&quot; Opal deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yes. Hmm. Oh, have you seen Twilight anywhere? She&#039;s been missing for a couple of days.&quot;</p><p class="double">Opal shrugged. &quot;No clue. Go see if Angel knows anything. The only owl I understand is you.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Actually, aren&#039;t you up a little early? It&#039;s not even evening yet!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh har de har har. One week of all nighters and you never live it down.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked up.</p><p class="double">&quot;....so. Let me see if I understand this. You wanted to see if the alicornification spell worked on an owl.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now....&quot; She gestured. &quot;You&#039;re an owlbear.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rubbed one of her antlers awkwardly. &quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...How. How does this even make sense?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... I&#039;m still part owl?&quot; The violet giant giggled awkwardly and cringed. &quot;I can fix this, I think. I just need a few things.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy sighed, tugging at her long ears. &quot;I&#039;ll go see if I can sneak something from Angel for you. What is it you need?&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p>26.10 (misterq)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up in a comfortable bedroom and waited until the memories hit. She was human this loop, and very young. Her name was Tai Lee and she was just about to start fourth grade at Ponneville Magical Elementary School along with her friends, Jacqueline Apple-Smyth, Bonnie Dash, Felicia Shai, Rarity Belle, and... and...</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Mina Diane &#039;Pinkie&#039; Pie woke up on a train with a huge grin on her face. Her parents were drilling experts working for BP who had recently transferred to the London division. That meant that she was going to Hogwarts! On one hand she was going to miss all her friends, but on the other hand, she had never had a solo Hogwarts loop before. Also she had hands again now. They always made her giggle. Like five tiny legs on the end of a longer leg.</p><p class="double">Neville opened a compartment of a train only to see a strange girl with light red hair giggling while wiggling her fingers. Mustering up what courage he had, he attempted to get her attention, &quot;Um, hello. My name is Neville. Have.. have you seen a toad around here? He may answer to the name, Trevor. I&#039;m afraid mine seems to have run away.&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl whirled her head towards him and grinned in a wide, and somewhat disturbing manner, &quot;Hi Neville! My name is Pinkie Pie. Actually it&#039;s Mina Diane Pie, but everyone just calls me Pinkie Pie. Don&#039;t worry about your toad. Gummy and I will help you look!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, thank you,&quot; the young wizards was having second thoughts about asking this girl for help.</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem!&quot; Pinkie said and whipped out a small alligator from somewhere, and held it in both hands, &quot;Gummy, find Trevor!&quot;</p><p class="double">The alligator just sat there in her grip, only slowly wagging his tail.</p><p class="double">&quot;This way!&quot; The girl jumped up and ran out of the compartment. Neville followed cautiously and with growing dread.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Godric Gryffindor had created the sorting hat with more than a few secrets. One of them was a result of him trying to figure out a way of dealing with children who were advanced enough to have trained their minds to be unreadable by said hat. The quickest way he solved this problem was to make the hat automatically sort anyone who it couldn&#039;t read into his house. In addition to getting talented children who had been skilled in controlling their own minds, this little feature would result, over the years, in Gryffindor getting a half-giant boy who would otherwise gone to Hufflepuff, and a werewolf who would have been a shoo-in for Ravenclaw.</p><p class="double">So when Pinkie Pie put on the sorting hat, it just yelled out &#039;Gryffindor&#039; and automatically rebooted itself from the sugar mind-induced magical blue screen of death. She quickly ran down and sat next to Neville at the table. They had found Trevor in minutes. After Pinkie introduced the terrified toad to her alligator, she had declared herself and Neville to be best friends in Hogwarts, whether the boy wanted to be or not. Then, she had proceeded to buy and eat most of the candy that was left on the snack cart. Neville had a feeling it was going to be a very long, very interesting year.</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;You have to calm down,&quot; Applejack told Twilight, &quot;I&#039;m sure Pinkie is going to be fine on her lonesome.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked over her remaining awakened friends who were all gathered together at the school library, &quot;I&#039;m not worried about that. Do you remember what happened the last time Pinkie had a solo loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack answered, &quot;She turned out just fine. Grew wings and a horn, if I recall correctly.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity paled, &quot;I don&#039;t think that is what Twilight is getting at. The last time Pinkie was left alone, she became the chaos goddess of joy and celebration for the entire galaxy. And then there was the time the non-awake version of her became an alicorn princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now she is all alone in the corrupt an nasty English wizarding world,&quot; Fluttershy spoke up, &quot;It&#039;s not nearly as horrible as that loop&#039;s universe, but it is still pretty bad.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash asked with slight confusion, &quot;So wait. You&#039;re saying that we don&#039;t have to go save Pinkie from the English magical world. We have to go save the English magical world from Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded as vigorously as an eleven year old girl could, &quot;Yes. Although it may already be too late.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie sat in a small corner of the bathroom with her arms wrapped around her legs. Her long hair was over her eyes and she was trying not to cry. Of course, she realized that she now had the emotional stability of an eleven year old girl. So when Ron Weasely told her that she was extremely annoying and that no one wanted to come to her far too frequent parties, it had hurt far, far more than it should. </p><p class="double">Sure, she could go all alicorn party goddess on this loop, but she had the feeling that would end it immediately, and she was kind of enjoying learning human magic. </p><p class="double">So when she heard the sound of the bathroom door locking and looked up into the face of an angry troll, she knew she had to take care of this Pinkie Pie style.</p><p class="double">Harry Potter and Ron quickly unlocked the door after racing back up the stairs to the second floor bathroom. It took them a while to realize that they locked the troll in with their classmate and hoped that the fact that there was no screaming didn&#039;t mean that something horrible had happened.</p><p class="double">All their preconceived notions vanished when the door opened. Inside, they beheld a party.</p><p class="double">Balloons and streamers were everywhere. A large partially eaten feast was prepared to one side and a massive banner proclaimed in large letters &#039;Welcome to Hogwarts, Mr. Troll&#039;.</p><p class="double">On the other side of the large bathroom, was a large smelly troll who was currently using his club to play a giant magically reinforced game of whack-a-mole. Idly, Harry noticed that that one of the moles popping up resembled a certain potion professor. It was also worth double the points according to the increasing floating numbers designating the troll&#039;s score. Pinkie Pie was using pom-poms to cheer him on. </p><p class="double">Then she noticed the two boys. </p><p class="double">&quot;See? Not everyone thinks my super fun parties are annoying. Isn&#039;t that right, Mister Thok?&quot;</p><p class="double">The troll, Mr. Thok apparently, nodded and gave a happy grunting noise as he clobbered the Snape-looking whack-a-mole with a club slam that shook the floor a little.</p><p class="double">It turns out that fear and awe of an insistent little girl that could control trolls could also be basis for a lasting friendship.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was just about ready to teleport the gang over to England on a rescue mission when an owl holding an alligator holding a letter appeared outside her window. The girl slowly and cautiously let them into her room. The very familiar alligator opened its mouth and dropped the letter on her bed before the two flew into her bathroom and closed the door. Soon, there was a sound of her bathtub being filled with water.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what does it say?&quot; Applejack tore Twilight&#039;s attention back towards the envelope.</p><p class="double">Twilight carefully picked up the letter, opened it, and began to read.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Hello, friends! This is Pinkie Pie! Hopefully you are all &#039;awake&#039; and bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not that we actually have tails anymore, bushy or otherwise, although I&#039;m working on that. I don&#039;t know if you all want to come and rescue me from the spooky haunted super magic castle, but I am having tons of fun here learning magic. Most of it even works for me. Well, some of it does.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m no expert, but the fact that I still have earth pony magic and chaos goddess magic running through me, somehow, makes the normal magic I&#039;m trying to learn act all kooky strange. The way I understand it is that it isn&#039;t like plugging a DC device into a wall socket with no converter, but more like prying open the battery case and stuffing it full of waldorf salad, hot lava, and magical amulets; then hoping for the best.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Half the time, my spells work just fine. A quarter of the time, they work, but are either way too powerful or barely powerful enough. And the last quarter of the time, strange things happen. The professors are still trying to figure out how I turned a regular feather into a giant angry unkillable purple tentacle plant that was also on fire.</i></p><p class="double"><i>They say that that part of the castle will be safe in another few days or so. A week at most.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Our transfiguration teacher turned into a human from being a cat, but then lied and said &#039;no&#039; when I asked if she was a moon cat. I don&#039;t know who her magical girl is, but I will find out soon. She was also unhappy that when she turned her desk into a piggy, only I was quick enough to be able to ride it out of the room and into the hallway.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Oh, in other news. I threw a party for a Mr. Thok, who is a giant troll. After some translation from Rubeus Hagrid, who is a vary large hairy man that lives alone in a wooden shed not far from where we kids go to school; Principal Dumbledore just decided to extract Mr. Thok&#039;s memories and then threw them into a big bowl. Then he tried to play apple-bobbing, but with memories instead of apples. Then he got really mad and chased Professor Quirrell out of the school.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ron, who is a boy in my house and my new friend, asked me to not have so many parties. I happily agreed. Then I met with his brothers, who are twins and love pranks of all sorts. We came up with so many good ideas. So many. I&#039;ll try to record some of the good ones so you can see them, Dashie.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ron was upset at me when he thought that Gummy ate his missing rat, Scabbers. But I told him that Gummy has no teeth and that I would get him another pet that is much better than his old rat. I&#039;m mixing up several batches of polyjuice potion right now. Not sure what I&#039;ll get when I mix bits of every magical animal I can find together and then feed it to the giant freshwater squid, but it has got to be better than a boring old rat, right?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Don&#039;t worry, the ingredients were super easy to get with the Potions teacher in the hospital. They say something shredded his mind real bad. I have no idea what it was, but I think it tried to get me too because right before he collapsed all twitchy and foamy at the mouth, I had a brief headache. I think it was some kind of invisible mind ghost, but I laughed at it and it hasn&#039;t bothered me since.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Actually those last parts happened around Halloween, which is three months from now. And I think Gummy should now be done with his bath. In ending, hope everything is fine with all of you. Don&#039;t come &#039;rescue&#039; me. I&#039;ll write you guys another letter when a good time to go visit would be.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Toodles,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Pinkie Pie.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">When Twilight finished talking, the owl swooped out of the bathroom carrying the newly cleaned alligator. The alligator opened his mouth and a giant red swirling portal formed in front of the two animals, closing quickly once the two flew inside.</p><p class="double">For a moment, no one spoke. Then Applejack stood up and calmly put her hat on her head, &quot;See. I told you she was fine. Everything is fine. I&#039;m going to go home now and pretend really hard that magical Pinkie Pie is farther than only half the world away. Goodnight, all.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>27.1</p><p class="double">“All the cakes have been sabotaged!” Pinkie gasped. “I know just what to do!”</p><p class="double">The others looked at her sceptically. “Really?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” She pulled a clockwork pigeon from her mane, slotted in a key, and wound it up. After a few turns, she lifted it to her mouth and spoke slowly and clearly. “I need your help. Come quick.”</p><p class="double">The earth pony trotted briskly to the window and threw the pigeon out.</p><p class="double">It flew exactly as well as a dense lump of metal would be expected to fly, bounced off the gravel, and exploded into a cloud of gears and springs.</p><p class="double">“You rang?” Discord asked, coming through a trapdoor in the floor.</p><p class="double">Pinkie clapped her hooves. “I knew that would get your attention!”</p><p class="double">“Actually, you were just passing by. I was having a sleep.”</p><p class="double">“Where?” Gustav asked, looking out the window. “There is not any lights for miles…”</p><p class="double">“The sleepers, duh.” Discord turned to Pinkie. “So, what’s up?”</p><p class="double">“Someone’s been eating the cakes!” Pinkie said, pointing. “That one, and that one, and those two.”</p><p class="double">The chaotic draconequus snapped his fingers and materialized a magnifying glass, deerstalker hat and bubble pipe.</p><p class="double">“No, sorry…” Pinkie shook her head. “We already did that one.”</p><p class="double">Discord looked downcast. “What about if I speak in zee foreign accent, like zee great Parrot?”</p><p class="double">A rolling pin bounced off his head.</p><p class="double">“I think Gustave finds it offensive.” Pinkie retrieved the rolling pin and passed it back to him. “Eight out of ten for accuracy, but only a six for force.”</p><p class="double">Discord got out a long list. “Hmmm… magical private eye?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight did that one.”</p><p class="double">“Secret agent?”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Joe answered, then paled. “Oh, what a giveaway!”</p><p class="double">Getting out his magnifying glass again, Discord perused the list. Having a quick peek, Mulia was none the wiser. “List of mystery plot protagonist stereotypes? What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p class="double">Discord glanced over the paper at her. “And so much for ninja, as well. Right, that’s it, I’m completely out of stereotypes. They’ve all been done.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie passed him a PADD. “What about the hacker?”</p><p class="double">“…I was just testing you,” he said unconvincingly, and pulled a cord out of the back of the PADD. “Right…”</p><p class="double">He typed on the little computer seemingly at random, occasionally saying things like ‘disabling code walls’ or ‘hacking all IPs simultaneously.’.</p><p class="double">Eventually, he held it up triumphantly. “I have it! It was the butler!”</p><p class="double">Everyone else on the train gave him a <i>look.</i></p><p class="double">“…fine, then, don’t trust the hacker.” Discord snapped his fingers, and the damage to the cakes was repaired. “Right, I’m going back to my nap.”</p><p class="double">Opening the trapdoor again to reveal a long set of spiral stairs, he walked down them muttering and was out of sight.</p><p class="double">Mulia shook her head. “Did that just happen?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “Hey, we got our cakes back, right?”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.2</p><p class="double">Cadence trotted over to the door. “Coming!”</p><p class="double">When it creaked open, she saw one of the palace maids standing there.</p><p class="double">Her eyes narrowed, then widened. “Oh, you poor thing! Shining, come here!”</p><p class="double">The unicorn cantered over. “What is it, dear?”</p><p class="double">“The poor thing’s starving, look!” Cadence pointed to the maid, who was now looking a little confused. “Can we help her?”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know…” Shining said, dubiously.</p><p class="double">“Please?” Cadence did her best puppy-eyes.</p><p class="double">Shining gave in. “Alright, dear. You know best.”</p><p class="double">She nibbled his mane affectionately, then they touched horns. A brief pulse of bright pink magic flared up, and the maid collapsed.</p><p class="double">A moment later, there was a crackle of green energy, and Queen Chrysalis lay revealed and blinking up at them. “What…”</p><p class="double">“That should do you for a bit,” Cadence said with a smile. “We’ll get you sorted out with more love later on, but for now you need a bit of rest.”</p><p class="double">The ruler of the Changelings thought about that.</p><p class="double"><i>Eh, may as well go along with it.</i></p><p><hr></p><p>27.3</p><p class="double">“Hm…” the mouse said, squinting up at Twilight. “I’m afraid you’re a little… big to fit in the door.”</p><p class="double">Twilight examined it. “I think I could squeeze in… but you’re right, best not to risk it.”</p><p class="double">“I’ll get the cooks to send you out food, then.” The young mouse lay back on the springy roadside grass, looking up at her. “By the way… would you mind helping us with what comes up next in our Loop?”</p><p class="double">“Not at all,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“Good.” A chuckle. “Cluny’s still kind of a threat – he’s hardly an idiot, and getting together all the bits of Martin’s armour isn’t as safe as it could be – but since the biggest defender we normally have is a badger…”</p><p class="double">After a short pause, Matthias looked up again. “How are you at puzzles?”</p><p class="double">“I’m alright.” Twilight shrugged. “I don’t often get new ones, to be honest, which is a bit of a pain.”</p><p class="double">“You’ll like our Loop, then. Hold on a minute, I’ll write down the first one we normally run into. It’s hidden in the great hall.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled as the mouse scampered off. He seemed quite a pleasant fellow… although everyone here was so small compared to her that it was setting off Fluttershy-Squee responses.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">27.4</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the door, and the Crusaders looked up from their card game. “Come in!”</p><p class="double">The door creaked, admitting a black filly in a cloak. “Hi, everypony, Twilight said you were all – wait, what’s she doing here?”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara stared. “What are <i>you</i> doing in here?”</p><p class="double">“I asked first!” The filly stamped a hoof and stuck her tongue out. “So there.”</p><p class="double">“Should we do something?” Applebloom asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“Nah,” Scootaloo replied, putting her cards down face-down. “I’ll go make some milkshakes.”</p><p class="double">“I am Diamond Tiara,” the earth pony said, posing briefly. “I was invited. Officially, and everything.”</p><p class="double">“Seriously?” The filly shot a pitying look at Sweetie Belle. Then turned back to Diamond. “Wait, why did you <i>accept?</i>”</p><p class="double">“I answered your question,” Diamond replied, pointing. “Now you answer mine.”</p><p class="double">“I’m a Crusader as well!” The filly turned, showing off her cloak. “See?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’ve never met you.”</p><p class="double">“Look, are you guys Looping or not? ‘cause now I’m wondering if this is a bizarre alternate Equestria…”</p><p class="double">“This is coming from you?” Sweetie asked, and the filly blushed.</p><p class="double">“We <i>are</i> looping,” Applebloom said. “All four of us.”</p><p class="double">“…oh.” With a flap of wings that had been hidden under the cloak, the newcomer revealed herself to be an alicorn. “Hi, then, I’m Nyx. I’m kinda Princess Luna’s dark-but-not-evil side, it’s complicated. Sorry I reacted so badly, I once nearly got et by monsters ‘cause of a different version of you.”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.” Diamond shrugged. “I hope to show I’ve learned my lesson.”</p><p class="double">Nyx gaped. “Seriously, guys, is this an alternate universe version of Diamond Tiara? This is really confusing me. No offence.”</p><p class="double">“Some taken,” the pink filly replied.</p><p class="double">Sweetie and Applebloom exchanged looks. “Was that a seven?”</p><p class="double">“Eight!” Scootaloo shouted from the kitchen area, and came over balancing five milkshakes on hooves, wings and forehead. “…can somepony take these, please? I didn’t give nearly enough thought how to get them down again.”</p><p class="double">Nyx and Sweetie lifted some down, passed one on to each earth pony, and sat down with their own.</p><p class="double">“So…” Diamond said, awkwardly, “tell me how it is that you, er… exist.”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Nyx replied, “when an evil cult and a dark goddess love each other very much, and then they fluff a magic ritual designed to resurrect the evil goddess by using the blood of Momma – that’s Twilight Sparkle – they get a ball of fluff and feathers with no memory of her past life. That’s me. And then I got raised by Twilight for, like, a month or so, before the evil cult brought back my memories of being evil.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom cut in. “Yeah, a thousand years of evil rage ain’t much compared to a month of talkin’ to Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Pre-tty much.” Nyx looked down. “This is really good milkshake. Anyway, took over the world, didn’t feel like it, gave the world back, and then ‘cause of super luck I got Looping. I don’t turn up much, but I can’t complain.”</p><p class="double">Diamond nodded along. “Yeah, that’s about the second strangest thing I’ve ever heard.”</p><p class="double">“Second?” Nyx asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“Jewel Scouts,” all the others chorused.</p><p class="double">“…yeah, I’ll ask later. Hey, what game are you playing?”</p><p class="double">“It’s called Chaos. Discord gave it to us for playtesting.” Applebloom picked up her cards, and blinked. “I could swear I had a different set of cards five minutes ago.”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.5</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we are,” Twilight said, ushering the other five Elements in. “This is our new headquarters.”</p><p class="double">They looked around the single large room. There was a large projector on the ceiling, a complex mess of scientific equipment at one corner, and three sets of double doors leading off the central area.</p><p class="double">“Well, it looks nice…” Rarity said, with a moue of distaste for the furnishings. “I assume I can touch it up a bit?”</p><p class="double">“Feel free,” Twilight replied. “Now, this is the pantry.”</p><p class="double">Trotting smartly over to the first set of double doors on the north wall, she opened them to reveal a vast, cavernous room with dozens of aisles of freezers and cupboards. It looked like there was enough food in there to feed them for three years.</p><p class="double">“Where do we prepare it, then?” Pinkie asked. “There better be a good kitchen!”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled, and opened the second set of doors – the east wall – to reveal a kitchen that could cater for a hotel.</p><p class="double">“Wait, wait…” Dash frowned. “Food is cool, but what about… you know.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to the doors on the west wall. “Through there is the bathroom, showers, toilets, hot tub, spa and swimming pool.”</p><p class="double">The others looked at her with confusion. “Hold on a minute,” Applejack said, voicing their thoughts, “Where do we sleep?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave a mysterious smile and opened the north doors, revealing a much larger version of her own bedroom. Closing the doors and opening them again, this time an enlarged version of Dash’s room was revealed.</p><p class="double">With gradually dropping jaws, the Elements watched as Twilight opened the three double doors in a seemingly random pattern to reveal four more large bedrooms, a games room, a library, a gymnasium and a room full of seemingly random junk.</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” she said, finally shutting the third set of doors on a wardrobe large enough that it had a railway line on the floor, “I’ve printed up some adverts saying we do anything, any time. So if there’s a problem anywhere in Equestria and somepony needs our help, they’ll come to us.”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.6</p><p class="double">“This is the third one of these crimes in the last month,” Sergeant Stronghoof reported grimly. “Mode of operation is always the same. Jewellery stolen, box open, but the rooms are always locked. It’s a locked-room mystery, sir.”</p><p class="double">Shining blinked. “...over half the population in this city is <i>unicorns</i>, sergeant. What’s so significant about a locked room?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Stronghoof said, nodding. “I know it’s not a big deal normally, but all the owners swear blind the rooms don’t normally have locks on them.”</p><p class="double">“…oh.” Shining trotted over to examine the door more closely. “That’s not subtle, that’s showing off. And this magic got past the house owners?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Stronghoof consulted a pad of paper. “Which is rather strange, because they’re all very skilled mages who would detect this kind of thing normally.”</p><p class="double">“Sir!”</p><p class="double">Shining and the sergeant both spun to face the young guardsmare who’d spoken. “What is it, Rosette?”</p><p class="double">“Sir… there’s a letter for you outside, captain.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Shining made for the door. “I think I can handle this myself, sergeant.”</p><p class="double">“Wait – but – sir?” Stronghoof sputtered for a moment, then cantered after the captain.</p><p class="double">When he left the building, however, he saw no sign of the guard captain, and a torn envelope on the floor.</p><p><hr></p><p>A blue unicorn leant back against a chimney tower, feeling pleased with herself.</p><p class="double">Then, with a rush of wings, a white figure landed in front of her. “Give yourself up!”</p><p class="double">“Like hay!” she shouted back. “Wait. S – the S stands for <i>Shining?</i>”</p><p class="double">Trixie Lulamoon, professional criminal, collapsed on the roof heaving with laughter.</p><p class="double">Shining looked down at himself. “I didn’t think it was <i>that</i> bad…”</p><p class="double">“You’re wearing… oh, hee…” Trixie stifled her giggles with an effort of will, and rolled back upright again. “You’re dressed as <i>superman?”</i></p><p class="double">“Super-<i>pony</i>, thank you very much.” The stallion shrugged. “I’ve already got the shield, the ability to fly, and the invulnerability – with the right spell. You don’t think it fits…?”</p><p class="double">Trixie shook her head. “Nope. Does Cadence know you do this?”</p><p class="double">“Actually…” Shining pointed.</p><p class="double">Hooves clattered on the stonework as a second alicorn touched down next to them.</p><p class="double">Trixie collapsed with laughter again.</p><p class="double">“I feel hurt…” Cadence said sadly.</p><p class="double">Shining put a wing over her. “Don’t worry, Wonder Mare.”</p><p class="double">“Wonder mare!” Trixie gasped out.</p><p class="double">“Well, you’re one to talk,” Shining said stubbornly. “I mean, you <i>are</i> acting the supervillain this time.”</p><p class="double">Trixie wobbled as she climbed back to her hooves for a second time. “Yeah, thanks for – pfft – for reminding me.” She tapped the side of her neck, and the alicorn amulet dropped from where it had been hidden to dangle freely.</p><p class="double">“…wuh-oh…” Shining muttered.</p><p class="double">“Isn’t that thing evil?” Cadence asked, frowning.</p><p class="double">“Not quite evil <i>per se</i>.” Trixie shrugged, a red glow developing around her. “It’s an emotional amplifier with magical feedback and it makes you very short tempered, and it affects your judgement, but if I’m right then I shouldn’t be much more impetuous than I normally am.”</p><p class="double">“And if you’re wrong?” Shining said, a sinking feeling stealing over him.</p><p class="double">“Well, in that case, it’s nice we’re all in costume,” Trixie shrugged. “Should I tell you to Kneel Before Trixie, or shall we skip to the fight scene?”</p><p class="double">“…next time, we choose different costumes!” Shining hissed to his wife.</p><p class="double">“Aw…” Cadence replied, pouting. “But I like these ones…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight clicked her stopwatch as red/pink/blue magic erupted over the city of Canterlot. “…six hours, five minutes, twelve seconds between putting it on and resorting to force. Well, she’s getting better at controlling it…”</p><p class="double">“Is this really worth it?” Spike asked. “For the research side of it, I mean.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Borderline. But as for the show she puts on…” she slid a bag of popcorn over to him, and opened another after flash-heating it with a quick spell.</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Fair enough.” He started eating his own popcorn, as flashes like lightning bounced off the clouds. “Think we should sell tickets?”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.7 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;It was us, Mistress Rarity,&quot; said the leader of the Diamond Dogs as all the other canids ran towards the surface in sheer panic, &quot;We didn&#039;t means to, but we dug deep. Too deep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? What have you unleashed?&quot; Rairty asked, even as she prepared her emergency teleport spell.</p><p class="double">&quot;No time! No time! They&#039;ll be here soon. We must flee!&quot; The alpha dog said before he, too, ran for the exit.</p><p class="double">Rairty glanced back towards the mine when she began to hear it. It started quietly, like a whispering brook; but slowly intensified as the distance between decreased. The pale unicorn managed to pale even further, her eyes diminishing into pinpricks, as she finally recognized the sound that she would never ever forget for as long as she existed.</p><p class="double">The sound of, &quot;Fun? Fun? Fun! Fun! Funfunfunfunfunfunfunfunfun!!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>27.8 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Academic Excellence (Final part)</u></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">When Lightning Dust arrived in the mess hall the next morning, there was something different about her, her usual self confident attitude absent along with the grin on her face. The other Ponyville ponies were sitting with Dash as usual, and they quieted and turned to look at her as she came up to the table. Lightning Dust looked almost ready to turn and bolt, but Dash gave her a slight nod and a reassuring grin, so she visibly gritted her teeth, screwing up her courage to say something.</p><p class="double">“Uh.... Hey, every-pony. Good day for flying...” She tried a grin, but it didn&#039;t seem to lighten the others expressions. She sighed. “Look, guys, I&#039;ve been doing a lot of thinking, about what you all said last night, about what Dashy said, and I want to say... I&#039;m sorry!”</p><p class="double">That seemed to mollify them somewhat and, encouraged, she continued. “I guess I&#039;ve been acting like a jerk, to all of you, but I don&#039;t get this touchy-feely stuff, I&#039;ve always worked alone because, well it&#039;s hard for me to slow to other ponies speed! I love going fast and looking awesome doing it! I never figured out this whole &#039;getting along with other ponies&#039; thing because I never needed it. ”</p><p class="double">She shook her head, shaking out her mane. “But Dash was right. No Wonderbolt ever flew solo. If I ever want to join them, I need to learn. I know I haven&#039;t exactly given you much reason to help me, but that&#039;s what I&#039;m asking for. Please, could you guys give me a helping hoof?”</p><p class="double">The other ponies looked back and forth between themselves, and finally Thunderlane spoke for them. “Okay... I guess we&#039;ll soon see if you&#039;re full of cumulus or not.”</p><p class="double">After food, the group trooped out to the runway for that day&#039;s exercise. Spitfire was there, apparently getting her ears cleaned out with a sonic blast as one of her cohorts blew a reveille right next to her. However, it didn&#039;t seem to affect her speech as she gave them their mission.</p><p class="double">&quot;Today we&#039;ll be doing our famous air obstacle course. The object of this exercise is to work on your precision flying under extreme circumstances. And don&#039;t worry about winning. It&#039;s not a race.&quot;</p><p class="double">Every-pony in the cadet line up looked towards Lightning Dust, who had the good grace to blush.</p><p class="double">“Now everypony, get on your marks!”</p><p class="double">They dusted off in pairs, Snowflake and Cloudchaser in the lead, with Thunderlane and Raindrops then Milky Way and Wildflower behind them. Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust were the last pair waved off the runway.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust spoke as soon as they were air-borne. “Okay, let&#039;s do this... don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve got it, not a race, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Rainbow Dash replied, “Doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t stay in perfect synch and blow every-pony away with our precision flying. Just give me a vector!”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust was unsurprised to find that when they got in the assigned air-lane, Dash stayed on her wing as if nailed there. They swept through the cloud hoops and weaved around the rising clouds like they weren&#039;t there and even though they weren&#039;t pushing it, they soon came up behind Milky Way and his partner.</p><p class="double">“Aw stratus! I can&#039;t see a way past without getting out of our track!” Lightning Dust exclaimed. Then she realised what she&#039;d said, and looked over at Dash. “I guess we&#039;re stuck here then?”</p><p class="double">“Not if we ask for help.” Dash replied. “This isn&#039;t a race, like the lady said. Besides, I&#039;ve got a manoeuvre that&#039;ll work. The Flying Cross!”</p><p class="double">An quick explanation and a demonstration with her fore-hooves showed Lightning Dust what to do.</p><p class="double">“I like it!” Lightning Dust replied eagerly. “Uh guys... Milky Way wasn&#039;t it and...” A whisper from Rainbow gave her “... and Wildflower. We need to pass, just stay straight and level, okay?”</p><p class="double">“You only have to ask.” Wildflower called back.</p><p class="double">“Huh, I guess so.” Lightning Dust replied, surprised at how easy that had been. “Ready?”</p><p class="double">At Rainbow Dash&#039;s nod, they powered forward, doing a roll around a common centre. They swept past the other two ponies at right angles, Dash below and Dust above, their wing-tips forming a cross with the wings of the other ponies. They completed their roll-out without mussing a single hair in the manes of the others, though the conditions made that difficult to see.</p><p class="double">“Aw yeah!” Dust punched the air. “We can blaze through this course like that!”</p><p class="double">“Sure, if you want to do it the easy way...” Rainbow grinned.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;re you talking about pony?” Lightning Dust asked back.</p><p class="double">“Well, remember my vortex manoeuvre right back the first night? We could pick up the other six as trailers and go for an eight way formation. That should knock every-pony&#039;s goggles off!”</p><p class="double">“That would be pretty awesome!” Lightning Dust called back. “You guys up for that?”</p><p class="double">“Just watch us!” Wildflower exclaimed. They flew up behind the leading ponies as the two started to rev up their wings. Dash and Dust blasted forward, and drew Milky Way and Wildflower after them. The two rear ponies were straining to keep up, even with the aid of drafting behind the leaders, but they stayed on their tails through swerve and swoop and loop the loop.</p><p class="double">They caught up with Thunderlane and his wing-pony soon after, and flying crossed past them before making the same offer, and finally Cloudchaser and Snowflake just before the nastiest part of the course where the storm winds started. Both pairs quickly agreed to the plan.</p><p class="double">The eight ponies formed a double line as they followed the leader, punching their way into the lightning filled storm tunnel. Dust powered ahead, creating dead air as Dash did the same beside her, and felt rather than saw the change as Wildflower behind her started to slip out of the formation. An extra side blast of her wing rebounded the air-flow to bring her back into line, and she called back, “Keep it together!”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust wasn&#039;t going anywhere near as fast as normal, but she found to her great surprise that she wasn&#039;t bothered about it. The ponies behind her were sticking to her tail like a cloud-burr, following her every move, relying on her to guide them, and she found she was enjoying it. Dash was letting her call the shots as lead-pony, and she suddenly realised she wanted to be worthy of that trust.</p><p class="double">The storm lashed at them, and the ponies controlling the lightning fired off near misses that practically singed their manes, but the eight ponies powered on through. Then they reached the final stage, moving horizontal bars of air.</p><p class="double">“Okay, let&#039;s buck it up a notch and go over and under!” Lightning Dust called out. The eight ponies rippled up and down as they went through at full speed, and powered out of the other side still tightly together in their wing pairs.</p><p class="double">“Okay, the big finish!” She called out. “Let&#039;s land in formation, every-pony aim to drop hooves at the same time, if you guys figure you can!”</p><p class="double">“Just watch us!” Thunderlane called forward, and Snowflake yelled “YEAH!”</p><p class="double">They blew in like a stray gale, slamming hooves down and sliding out to a stop on the runway in front of Spitfire. If the clap of hooves wasn&#039;t perfect, it was only by a fraction of a second.</p><p class="double">“An eight way formation?” Spitfire&#039;s glasses actually slid down her muzzle and she quickly pushed them back up. “Impressive. You do know you didn&#039;t have to do that?”</p><p class="double">“No-pony said we didn&#039;t either ma&#039;am!” Lightning Dust replied, saluting and trying to hold back a big grin with indifferent success.</p><p class="double">“Well, it worked.” Spitfire shook her head as she consulted her stop-watch. “That might just be the fastest time any group of cadets ever pulled on the obstacle course. Okay, you can all hit the mess. Dismissed!”</p><p class="double">“Woo hoo!” “YEAH!” “How&#039;s that for kicking some cloud!” The ponies broke formation and celebrated. As they went off, Spitfre motioned Lightning Dust over. “A word, cadet.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust suddenly lost her grin as she started to worry she might have been too cocky about their win. She glanced at Dash and took some comfor4t from the lack of worry on her face. Dash knew Spitfire better, and she wasn&#039;t the type to enjoy seeing another pony get hammered.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry cadet, I just wanted to congratulate you on the way you lead the flight.” Spitfire looked over the top of her shades. “I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;ve overcome that attitude control problem you had yesterday.”</p><p class="double">“But I didn&#039;t...” Lightning Dust did a double take. Had Spitfire just made a joke? “Yes ma&#039;am, thank you ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">The Academy head returned the salute and glanced over at Rainbow Dash. “Looks like I made the right decision, pairing the two of you together. You make a great team.”</p><p class="double">As she walked away, Dash preened.</p><p class="double">“Oh yeah! We bucked that cloud all the way to Las Pegasus!” Rainbow Dash exclaimed, raising her hoof for a hoof bump which Dust returned. “Well, all that awesomeness has made me feel hungry.”</p><p class="double">“Me too!” Lightning Dust replied, flapping out her wings. “I feel the need... the need, to feed!”</p><p class="double">Laughing and chatting the pair headed off towards the mess.</p><p><hr></p><p>“... and that was the second time I kicked out a Sonic Rainboom. Of course, every-pony has seen me do one plenty of times since, right guys?”</p><p class="double">There was agreement from the lined up cadets.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust shook her head. “I&#039;d heard rumours, but I&#039;m still having trouble believing it&#039;s even possible!”</p><p class="double">“Heh!” Rainbow Dash gave her a companionable slap on the saddle with a wing-tip. “Tell you what, I&#039;ll show you how. I&#039;ve always wanted to try it with another pony, and I think you&#039;ve got the power to pull it off. You just need training. I&#039;ve asked this lot, but...”</p><p class="double">“None of us are that nuts!” Thunderlane finished with a chuckle.</p><p class="double">The rainbow maned pegasus&#039; eyes suddenly widened. “Oh yeah, I got a letter from Pinkie. She&#039;s so happy to hear how well we&#039;re doing that she and the girls are bringing us a care package.”</p><p class="double">That whoops of appreciation from the other Ponyville ponies. They all knew how great Pinkie&#039;s parties were. Knowing how nuts Pinkie had gotten the first time, Rainbow generally made sure to send regular updates on her progress, even when they were all Awake and otherwise pretty much following a base-line loop. However, that didn&#039;t stop Pinkie being Pinkie, or finding any excuse to throw a party.</p><p class="double">“I figure we&#039;ll set up on a cloud outside the Academy this evening after training, as long as we don&#039;t break curfew we should be fine. They&#039;ll be bringing a lot of food, we can charge up a nimbus and roast some marshmallows, surf some air-currents, play cloud-ball, rock out to some tunes... It&#039;s going to be awesome!”</p><p class="double">“Whoa there pony!” Lightning Dust exclaimed. “You said these were earth-ponies and unicorns... won&#039;t they fall through?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight can do a cloud-walking spell easy. Though she might try something more interesting...”</p><p class="double">There. If one of her friends wanted to go alicorn for the night, she could pass it off as an improved Wings spell Twilight had created.</p><p class="double">“It sounds great, Am I invited?” Lightning asked, not brashly as she might one have, but hopefully. She&#039;d never realised how good it was to be part of a group, or that you could do it without giving up being you. Despite yesterday, she was still feeling her way into her new relationship with these ponies, and didn&#039;t want to wreck it.</p><p class="double">“Heck yeah!” Rainbow Dash exclaimed. “Right guys?”</p><p class="double">Wildflower spoke up. “If she hadn&#039;t helped me recover in that formation exercise, I&#039;d have spun out and wrecked the whole thing. I never got to thank you for that, Lightning. So thanks, and we&#039;d love to have you.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re as nuts as she is!” Thunderlane added without heat. “So maybe with you on our side, a cloud-ball team will have a chance against Dash. So sure, the more the merrier!”</p><p class="double">As the others gave their approval, Rainbow saw Spitfire approaching out of the corner of her eye, and gave the others the high sign. By the time the instructors got there, the cadets were lined up at attention and silent.</p><p class="double">“Today is a competitive exercise. You will be working in your wing-pairs to clear the clouds.” Spitfire looked over the group and was pleased to see that much of the tension she&#039;d seen before had dissipated, though a couple of the other cadets glanced at Rainbow Dash and suppressed smirks when the nature of the exercise was stated. “Any questions?”</p><p class="double">Whatever else was going on, there were none so she signalled to Whiplash to blow the whistle and start the exercise. The other cadets flew up in staggered pairs and started punching out clouds in a methodical manner, trading off the lead as each hit a cloud and demolished it, hitting their weak spots. However, they didn&#039;t have chance to get far.</p><p class="double">“Okay, let&#039;s go!” Lightning Dust yelled out, blasting through the first cloud she saw without stopping.</p><p class="double">“Way ahead of you!” Rainbow Dash called from up ahead as she flew between two close together clouds and used an aileron roll to create a temporary vortex that drew them in and mashed them to pieces. “The trick is to keep it small and tight, bigger is not better, just harder to control.”</p><p class="double">The two went through the air like greased lightning, indeed Lightning Dust&#039;s contrail heightened the likeness. As they approached having cleared three quarters of the sky, Dash started to slow down.</p><p class="double">“Hey, you getting tired?” Lightning Dust called out as she came alongside.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash gave back a cocky grin . “As if! No, I just figured we could let the rest of the guys have some too.”</p><p class="double">“This is a competition!” Lightning Dust replied, frowning, and slicing a cloud apart en-passant with a wing-tip and a burst of weather magic.</p><p class="double">“You don&#039;t think we&#039;ve won?” Rainbow Dash asked, veering to point a hoof back at the vast swathe of clear sky.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust gave a tight shake of her head. “No, but I want to finish this properly. I don&#039;t want to say I did less than my best. Even if it costs me that invite.”</p><p class="double">“If it does, it won&#039;t be from me. None of them are sore losers, and you&#039;re the lead-pony in this formation, so let&#039;s go!”</p><p class="double">They blew away the majority of the remaining clouds in moments, and came in to land ahead of the other teams. The target area far over the Academy had been much larger than the valley of Ponyville, but it had only taken them a couple of minutes total.</p><p class="double">As the other pairs flew down to land around her, Lightning Dust looked around. No-pony seemed particularly annoyed that they&#039;d been utterly out classed.</p><p class="double">“It was a competition. I wasn&#039;t going to hold back, okay?” she exclaimed defensively.</p><p class="double">Vast amounts of spontaneous rage failed to materialise, and Lightning Dust looked relieved. “So no-pony&#039;s mad?”</p><p class="double">“Pfft! Like any-body stood a chance against Miss &#039;Clear a sky in ten seconds flat&#039; over there even by herself.” Cloudchaser replied.</p><p class="double">Milky Way added. “No-pony&#039;s going to buck lightning over some-pony winning fair and square. Or if they are, they&#039;re idiots.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks... Wait? Ten seconds?” The green pegasus turned to Dash. “You were holding back?”</p><p class="double">“I was sticking with my lead pony.” Dash shrugged. “And Ponyville&#039;s in a valley. Smaller sky area.”</p><p class="double">Whiplash had only just finished adding checks to the chalkboard, as they&#039;d actually destroyed the clouds faster than he&#039;d been able to mark it off. He turned to go to fetch Spitfire with a somewhat sandbagged expression, when a half scale glowing white alicorn alighted by Rainbow Dash. It had a slight haziness moved rather like solid smoke.</p><p class="double">It spoke in Twilight&#039;s voice. “Rainbow Dash! We&#039;ve got a problem! We were skirting the edge of the Everfree Forest on the way to the Academy and we picked up an unwanted stalker. It&#039;s a massive cloud but it&#039;s acting like a creature. It&#039;s chasing us and with the balloon so heavily loaded, it&#039;s all we can do to stay ahead of it. We need help!”</p><p class="double">An image projected from its horn of a towering cumulonimbus, but with black triangular holes as eyes and a gaping maw with continuous arcs of lightning forming the outline of jagged teeth. Great tornadoes of streaming cloud formed arms that left trails behind them, sucking any in any cloud that got too close. The image wavered for a moment, then vanished, as did the alicorn.</p><p class="double">“Oh pony-feathers!” Dash exclaimed, “I read about them in the old weather-pony logs for Ponyville, but I thought they were just an old pony tale made up by some-pony who&#039;d had one too many mugs of Granny Smith&#039;s special reserve!”</p><p class="double">Inwardly she was given furiously to think. Had Twilight set this up as some sort of alternative test of character? It was probably clear from Dash&#039;s last letter that she&#039;d pretty much derailed the regular plot. She was certainly holding back, as any of the ponies in that balloon could probably have taken it out. But Twilight wasn&#039;t the sort to drop something on any-pony unannounced, and Dash <i>had</i> read about such things in the old weather-pony logs, and it was an Ursa Major threat level for any-pony who wasn&#039;t an immortal alicorn.</p><p class="double">“What the hey was that!” Lightning Dust gasped, and she wasn&#039;t the only one.</p><p class="double">“The silver thing? A communication spell Twilight&#039;s been working on. The cloud? A Tempest, right out of the Everfree forest. Remember, clouds move by themselves over there, and the place is lousy with magic. No-pony knows how they form, but it&#039;s similar to a Timberwolf, a vicious predator that feeds on magical energy...”</p><p class="double">She turned to the stunned Whiplash and yelled. “Go get Spitfire, scramble every-pony you can and head after us! Head south southeast. We&#039;ll need all the help we can get!”</p><p class="double">As he galloped off, the other cadets were looking equally surprised. Cloudchaser shook her head. “I can&#039;t believe they&#039;re real... Wait, did you mean...”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re the only ponies on the runway, they&#039;ll need time to get organised and Twilight and the others may not have that long... I know it&#039;s not what you signed up for, but some-pony has to delay it and get the balloon clear. And I <i>know</i> you&#039;re the ponies for the job!”</p><p class="double">The other Ponyville ponies looked back and forth, and you could see their expressions firm up along with their resolve and their wings.</p><p class="double">She turned to Lightning Dust. “We have to go, they&#039;re in danger and they need our help.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust gulped. That thing was horrifying, every pegasus&#039; worst nightmare, but she was a Lead pony, and she couldn&#039;t let the others go and hide here, not and look at herself in the mirror in the morning. “Okay, but you&#039;re going to tell us everything you know about this creature on the way.”</p><p class="double">She dusted off, and the others followed her, or more probably Dash, who filled them in on what little was known. These things made Timberwolves look bright, but they were still dangerous as they would attack whatever attracted their attention. A large mass of ponies could drive them back with their combined weather magic, but it would take all the pegasi in Ponyville to do the job.</p><p class="double">It was crazy, Rainbow Dash clearly knew the thing and all the other ponies followed her, but she was acting as if she expected Lightning Dust to give the orders. Yes, as Lead pony of the highest scoring wing-pair, she was effectively the leader of the group, but she was beginning to realise as never before the difference between authority and leadership.</p><p class="double">She panicked for just a second, but something in her realised that if she lost it now, she&#039;d never get it back, so she forced herself to think. What has Dash said about leadership?... Okay.</p><p class="double">“Ideas any-pony? As Dash said, we need to get the balloon clear and keep the thing contained until every-pony else gets there.”</p><p class="double">Cloudchaser piped up. “Snowflake and I can tow the balloon. We&#039;re not the fastest flyers, but he&#039;s one of the strongest.“</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” Snowflake agreed.</p><p class="double">“We could play cloud-tag with it, take turns to distract it and keep it changing which way it&#039;s going.” Milky Way mused.</p><p class="double">“That works!” Lightning Dust said. “Dash?”</p><p class="double">“If we go in at different heights, that should mix it up even more. Those twister arms can&#039;t change height or direction too fast.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust nodded. “We&#039;ll take the middle as we&#039;ll be doing the most dodging.”</p><p class="double">Wildflower looked at Milky Way. “Up high?”</p><p class="double">He nodded and Thunderlane said, “I guess that leaves us the low ponies on the totem pole, eh Raindrops?”</p><p class="double">They started to see the trouble ahead, the balloon was floating towards them, towed by Fluttershy and aided by the glow of Twilight&#039;s and Rarity&#039;s horns. Pinkie Pie was in the crow&#039;s nest on top of the balloon, and was clearly trying to drive it off with blasts from Pinkie&#039;s party canon while Applejack was managing Fluttershy&#039;s rope.</p><p class="double">Dash knew all of them were awake, though they&#039;d been staying low profile this loop to relax. So they could have handled this thing like small change, but they&#039;d clearly decided to leave it to Dash and her team. Dash worried for a moment, could her fellow pegasi handle it? Then she looked around at her flight group, and Lightning Dust... or rather her group, full stop. They were scared, and unlike Rainbow Dash they had reason to be, but they were also determined and ready to face that thing, take the risk and she couldn&#039;t take that away from them.</p><p class="double">Snowflake and Cloudchaser peeled off the formation as they passed, flying round to come up either side of Fluttershy. They quickly got their own ropes courtesy of Applejack, and the balloon finally started to pull away.</p><p class="double">The other three wing-pairs dove in towards the cloud monster itself , splitting off to take their assigned heights. As they&#039;d agreed on the way in Lightning Dust and Dash went first, pulling down their goggles as they went into attack formation.</p><p class="double">Dash swept in close and zipped back and forth. “Hey you, Puff the magic cloud! Your momma was a sub-tropical convection cell! I&#039;ve seen scarier clouds when I breath out on a cold morning! C&#039;mon you Nimrod Nimbus, come and get me!”</p><p class="double">While it clearly didn&#039;t understand the insults, the cloud monster was clearly tracking her with its &#039;eyes&#039;. It roared like a storm wind blowing through the trees and a vast funnel arm swung towards her as it veered away from following the balloon to chase her. She could have out ranged it easily, but that wasn&#039;t the idea. Instead she actually flew in closer to make sure its attention focussed on her. The cloud&#039;s tornado &#039;arms&#039; flailed after her.</p><p class="double">“Dash, let&#039;s tie it up!” Lightning Dust called as she dived in. “Yo, fog-face! You couldn&#039;t hit the ground with a rain storm! Yeah Lightning Lips, I&#039;m talking about you! C&#039;mon you third-rate thunderhead, start something!”</p><p class="double">The cloud reached after her and she let the edge of one tornado tug at her tail, but she broke free and drew it after her as Dash did the same for the other arm. Without actually saying anything, they flew in and around each other, and as they did the two tornadoes became intertwined, immobilising them.</p><p class="double">They swooped out of the tangle as a pair, whooping and laughing. “Oh yeah, we have wings, we have the talent... whoa!”</p><p class="double">Dash&#039;s bad-ass boast was interrupted as she bucked Lightning Dust away from her, a fraction of a second before a bolt of lightning about half the width and twice the length of the Canterlot Express passed through the airspace they&#039;d just occupied, and just barely failed to turn them both into Southern Fried pegasus nuggets.</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t know it could do that!” she exclaimed. “We can&#039;t let the others get hit! They&#039;ll have to back off.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust shook her head, as they veered out of the way of another bolt that tracked after them. “No! They&#039;ll be harder to hit, but easier to track. They need to stay in tight so it can&#039;t focus!”</p><p class="double">Dash thought for a split second. “Good call!”</p><p class="double">She amped up her voice using weather magic to modulate the air and yelled, “Keep close and keep dodging! Don&#039;t let it home in on you!”</p><p class="double">As they weaved around clouds in extreme evasion manoeuvres, they saw its arms were untangling. Dash growled. She was this close to opening a storm of alicorn style flank-whooping on the thing, but that would wreck all the work she&#039;d done, and there was a better way. “Uh oh! If they try and bust that cloud the regular way, ponies are going to get hurt!”</p><p class="double">“So you have an irregular way?”</p><p class="double">“What do you say to a double Sonic Rainboom delivered right to the heart of that thing from above?”</p><p class="double">“Most people would say you&#039;ve swallowed too much cloud and it&#039;s fogging your brain...” Lightning Dust exclaimed then gave a little growl. “... but I guess they were right. I am just as nuts as you. Of course you haven&#039;t taught me how to do a Sonic Rainboom. “</p><p class="double">“No time like the present! Come on!” Dash suddenly went into a vertical ascent, calling out to the others as they flew past, “Just keep it off balance for a few more seconds, then scatter when we hit it!”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ll need some altitude!” Dash pushed some real power into her wings, giving them a slight rainbow aura, and shot upwards as if someone had just repealed the law of gravity. Lightning Dust panted to keep up with her, and just barely managed it. They came to a stop far above the scene of the battle, with the cloud a tiny puffy shape below, harried by the specks of circling pegasi.</p><p class="double">“Whoa! You can go that fast in an ascent?” Lightning Dust gasped for air until she felt Dash&#039;s weather magic wash over her and the air thicken around her.</p><p class="double">“Wait until you see what&#039;s next!” Dash grinned. “Besides you matched me.”</p><p class="double">She held out her fore-hooves. Place yours against mine, then we dive and stay together. Focus any weather magic you can spare from speeding up to forming a shield in front of you. You should be able to feel what I&#039;m doing, just match it, okay?”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust gave a curt nod, and touched fore-hooves to Dash&#039;s. “Let&#039;s do this!”</p><p class="double">They inverted in mid-air, still in contact, and started to dive, matching wing-beats. They quickly went past their ascent speed and kept accelerating at a rate even Lightning Dusts hadn&#039;t thought she could manage. Any pegasus worth their pinion feathers had a go at seeing how fast they could go in a power-dive at least once in their lives, but this was pushing limits she hadn&#039;t even realised she had. On top of that, she was trying to balance the power she put into accelerating with the weather magic she was feeding into the shock wave that started to form in front of them.</p><p class="double">Her hooves started to peel away from Dash&#039;s as she started to exhaust herself, and she cried, “I can&#039;t hold it...”</p><p class="double">“You can!” Dash called back, “I know you can do this, and every-pony&#039;s We&#039;re relying on you! Remember, the bigger the challenge... ”</p><p class="double">Lightning gritted her teeth. “... the better we like it!”</p><p class="double">The Wonderbolt mantra flashed through her mind, along with the last time she&#039;d heard it. They were getting near the cloud now, and she could see the other ponies clearly, still playing a deadly game of tag to hold it in place. Other moments flashed through her thoughts, leading them through the obstacle course, the way they&#039;d accepted her once she&#039;d stopped being a jerk. Most of all throughout it was Dash, defending her, supporting her, believing in her; even when she&#039;d done nothing to warrant it...</p><p class="double">It reached something deep inside her, and she felt it explode outwards, giving her new energy. Dash had put her faith in Lightning Dust, and she was <i>not</i> going to let her friend down. She came back into synch with Dash, and threw that power into her wings and the shockwave, which transformaed into a sharp cone that crackled with energy.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Dash exulted. “On my mark, we buck it over...”</p><p class="double">The cadet pegasi dodging around the increasingly frantic cloud monster saw a brilliant column in the sky, equal parts rainbow and lightning as it speared down into the crown of the monster with a glowing arrowhead at its tip. The cloud creature froze for a fraction of a second, and the triangular slits of its eyes suddenly turned into almost comical circles. The four of them took the chance to dive outwards and set their wings to ride the wave they knew was coming.</p><p class="double">The rainbow halo, shot with lightning and gold, exploded outwards just above the thing&#039;s mouth, slicing it in two and disrupting the magical forces that held it together. It scattered the pegasi like windblown leaves, but they&#039;d been ready for it, and it didn&#039;t hurt them. They could only hope the same was true for the two pegasi who&#039;d been at the centre of it.</p><p class="double">Thunderlane and Raindrops were carried in the direction of the Academy, and thus were the first ones to meet up with the relief force. Twilight&#039;s balloon was there, surrounded by wings of Wonderbolts, flying in staggered echelons. They had to have assembled every-pony in the place, cadets and instructors, and some of the pegasi at the back were harnessed in teams, towing lightning and storm projectors from the obstacle course.</p><p class="double">They headed for the apex of the lead chevron, where Spitfire, still in her mess dress uniform had point. They were quickly joined by Snowflake and Cloudchaser, who&#039;d been flying escort to the balloon. Spitfire saw them immediately. She waved off the salute they gave.</p><p class="double">“Cadet, report! Was that a Sonic Rainboom?”</p><p class="double">Thunderlane was the pony she addressed. “Yea ma&#039;am! Rainbow dash and Lightning Dust hit the thing together and destroyed it.”</p><p class="double">Spitfire nodded. “I saw the light trail and the explosion from here. What about them, and your other wing pair?”</p><p class="double">“Wildflower and Milky Way rode the wave the way we did, but they were around to the side. They must be half way to Ponyville by now. As for Dash and Dust... I couldn&#039;t see what happened, no-pony could.”</p><p class="double">Spitfire looked past him to where the cloud monster had disintegrated, and for the first time, he realised he could see worry in her eyes. He understood why, the energies at the heart of that cloud would have been enough to tear almost any pegasus to shreds if they placed a wing wrong. “Let&#039;s hope they&#039;re as capable as they seem to think they are...”</p><p class="double">Cloudchaser piped up. “They&#039;re tough! They&#039;ll be okay...”</p><p class="double">her eyes suddenly widened as she suddenly realised how familiar she was being. “...Ma&#039;am! Sorry, ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">Spitfire just shook her head. “It&#039;s okay cadet, I can understand you&#039;re a little out of it. You did good, all of you. But for now, we have other things to worry about. We need to set up search parties...”</p><p class="double">“No we don&#039;t!” A new voice had spoken. Pinkie Pie arrived, held up by a bunch of party balloons tied around her middle and propelling herself by spinning her candy-floss tail like a propeller. She pointed in the direction of the cloud, where two dots had just become visible. They flew towards the massed pegasi, and resolved themselves into Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">Both of them were flying relatively slowly, and both of them looked as if they&#039;d been dragged through a thunderstorm backwards (which they had, pretty much) but both of them were flying straight and level, and both had big, if tired grins on their faces. They flew up to Spitfire as the other cadets parted for them, and Lightning Dust snapped off a salute.</p><p class="double">“Cadets Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash reporting completion of cloud clearing duty, ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">Snowflake started what happened next, clapping his fore-hooves together slowly and deliberately. The other cadets took up the clapping, and then some of the other pegasi. The clapping swelled, speeding up as ponies started to cheer, while Pinkie puttered over and glomped Dash like a rainbow flavoured toothpaste tube.</p><p class="double">Spitfire spoke over the applause. “I&#039;ll debrief the two of you in my office afterwards, but first, I think both of you need to rest. Let&#039;s get you back to the Academy... all of you.”</p><p class="double">She detailed a party of fresh pegasi to go find Wildflower and Milky Way, then formed up the remainder of the Academy to escort the cadets and Twilight&#039;s balloon back to the airfield.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">27.9 (misterq, 26.10 continued)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">It was early morning at Hogwarts where a young pink bushy-headed girl sat on her bed, playfully swinging her legs. It was a very rare moment where Pinkie Pie was feeling a bit introspective. She had spent a few loops, ones that had her start out back at her parents&#039; rock farm, trying to act like a normal pony. One that was cheerful and liked birthdays, but didn&#039;t celebrate at every opportunity. One that didn&#039;t bounce around everywhere or eat vast amounts of sugar. One that knew about commonly accepted social graces and personal space, unlike someone who had grown up with her only friends being inanimate objects.</p><p class="double">She had even pranked her looping friends in one iteration by acting like a completely normal pony for a whole month. </p><p class="double">But in the end, she decided that she liked being Pinkie. She got a warm ticklish feeling whenever the others said &#039;It&#039;s just Pinkie being Pinkie&#039;. She liked throwing parties and eating horrifying amounts of sugary sweets and pretending not to know what was socially acceptable and what wasn&#039;t. Whenever she did something that was inexplicably impossible, she brought a bit of wonder and joy into her friends&#039; lives. </p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t as easy doing that as when she was a chaos goddess. That loop left a lasting impression on her magic, but that seemed to be it. After all, it wasn&#039;t like she now had a galaxy full of super happy space elves worshiping her.</p><p class="double">&#039;Yet,&#039; giggled a little voice inside of her. </p><p class="double">&#039;No,&#039; Pinkie laughed at her own subconscious, &#039;and no going magical alicorn demi-goddess on this world, because that will end all the fun. And I&#039;m having way too much of it for it to end so soon.&#039;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie bounced out of her bed and grabbed her wand, &quot;Letters to send, potions ingredients to procure, cakes to bake with the castle house elves, Pinkie Promise Breakers to... talk to. This day is going to be so FUN!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight tentatively opened another of her overseas friend&#039;s letters and read out loud to the remainder of her gathered friends, <i>&quot;Hi everyone! It&#039;s a letter from me, Pinkie Pie, again! How are you all doing? I&#039;m am fantasti-mazing as always. So many things happened I don&#039;t know where to start, so I&#039;ll just guess.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;After our old defence teacher left in such a hurry, a new one was hired. His name is Gilderoy Lockhart, and I had him Pinkie Promise that he would be a good teacher unlike the last one. He promptly broke it in his first class when he explained how he stole the memories of the people who actually did all the heroic stuff he said he did himself; and that he wasn&#039;t even that good at defence spells or care about teaching well; or that that shade of blonde was not his natural hair colour!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;How scandalous,&quot; Rairty exclaimed, causing her friends to give her a brief glance before going back to the letter.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Also in unrelated news, it&#039;s possible to mix a magical truth serum with a secret babbling potion and turn them both into an aerosol mist. Who knew? Anyways, I was about to talk to him to let him know how disappointed I was that he broke a Pinkie Promise, but he somehow got a bit of (okay, a lot of) fear potion and spider pheromones all over him, and ran off screaming into the super spooky forbidden forest. They looked for him for a while, but no sign yet. I think as long as he knows some defence spells, he should be fine.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash slowly turned towards Applejack and said, &quot;You got off easy, AJ. That one time you almost broke a Pinkie Promise could have ended with you as bride of the spider people.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack just shuddered and said, &quot;Just keep reading, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight complied, <i>&quot;Our history professor was a boring ghost, but I laughed at him and, you guessed it, I got detention. Then, next class, I did an exorcism ritual I made up and the other professors had to come and close the howling portal to the screaming netherworld that somehow opened up right as I was finishing up. I knew I should have had an old priest and a young priest, but I thought that ordaining my friends, Harry and Neville, should have worked fine; at least unless either of them had some previous unknown exposure to death magic or death magic related artifacts and accessories. But what was the chances of that?&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;In the end, Binns, our old history ghost is now history. Get it? Because he was sucked into a horrible vortex. To replace him, the ministry of magic sent this large woman who likes kittens and pink sweaters so very much. We&#039;re going to be such good friends, I just know it!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;My detention wasn&#039;t so bad. I had to clean a school bathroom. I guess I cleaned it too well, because one moment I was rubbing this neat little snake carving; and the other moment, I was sliding down a super duper fun slide. Then I met my new friend, who I decided to call &#039;Big Blinky&#039;, or BB for short. Some would say that Big Blinky is a giant snake, but that&#039;s not true at all. BB is a basilisk and as such has a hinged jaw and eyelids, so that means BB is a legless lizard. With eye beams. I spent the rest of the night riding around the spooky forest on BB&#039;s back, hunting spiders while yelling out, &#039;Maud&#039;dib!&#039; Best detention ever!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;In conclusion, the end. Just kidding! I&#039;m sure more fun stuff is coming. As always, I&#039;ll let you know when a good time to visit. With lots of parties, Pinkie Pie.&quot;</i></p><p><i><hr></i></p><p><i>27.10 (masterweaver)</i></p><p><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">&quot;Jack. Sparrow.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion turned around. &quot;Twilight Spoirkle! Fancy seeing you on this fancy ship. Fancy, innit?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yes. It&#039;s very fancy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Flying ships, I said. Flying ships. You know, that&#039;s very clever, I&#039;m going to have to figure out this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you know who this ship belongs to?&quot; Twilight continued calmly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold up.

Which is his tattoo thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cutie mark,&quot; Cloudkicker corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what I said.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned. &quot;I&#039;d accuse you of casting some sort of spell if I could figure any of this out--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You hear that Berry?

She’d been like this – very tired – since the reunion and that thing with the Nightmare Moon or whatever, and he couldn’t see a reason for it.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah, Mac,” she replied woozily. “Ah got it.”</p><p class="double">She stamped a hoof on the floor, and the earth rippled out from the impact point.</p><p class="double">And every single tree in the orchard dropped all its apples.</p><p class="double">Amazed, Mac watched as the ripple spread out, reaching the picket fences marking the boundaries of the Apple orchard, and then back in again carrying the just-dropped fruits.</p><p class="double">Humping up into a curler, the earth poured them neatly into boxes.</p><p class="double">Still with her eyes half closed, Applejack closed the boxes and stamped them with the Apple family proof mark. “Am ah done?”</p><p class="double">“…eeyup,” he replied quietly.</p><p class="double">“Good.” The earth pony mare walked into the barn, and collapsed onto a hay pile before starting to snore.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Sorry…” Applejack said, wincing. “Ah know ah was supposed to join th’ discussion yesterday about what t’ do this loop, but after last loop… y’all know, with th’ army of airships and th’ police job…”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded sympathetically. “Yes, I know the feeling – I’ve slept through a loop before after an especially tiring one, though only with somepony else like Dash around to take up the slack… or at least I try to.”</p><p class="double">The Anchor smiled. “Still, at least you got the harvest done on time.”</p><p class="double">“…ah did what?”</p><p class="double">Twilight held up a photo.</p><p class="double">Applejack winced again. “Ah, ponyfeathers. So much fer a quiet loop, after that ah’m gonna get interviewed…”</p><p class="double">“What happened, then?” Twilight asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“Earthbendin’, it’s called. Seems it’s more instinctual than ah was expectin’.”</p><p class="double">AJ winked at Twilight’s blank look, then laughed as it turned into ‘swot mode’. “Easy, there, Twi. Ah’ll explain what th’ place was like when ah’m good an’ ready.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.2</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon walked out onto stage. “Well, well. It’s been so long since-”</p><p class="double">There was a snigger.</p><p class="double">“Who did that?” she asked, turning towards where the voice had come from. “Admit it!”</p><p class="double">That brought a smattering of giggles.</p><p class="double">“Stop it!” she shouted. The giggles died away. “Right. Now. My… <i>beloved…</i> subjects-”</p><p class="double">Somepony made a muffled snort sound, as though a hoof was desperately and imperfectly restraining the sound of hilarity.</p><p class="double">“Oh, this is ridiculous!” Nightmare Moon fluffed out her feathers and stomped on the floor, producing a roar of laughter. “If you will not take my return seriously, then I am leaving! You’re all horrid!”</p><p class="double">Silence gradually descended, with only the occasional strained giggle cutting through it.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon decided to ignore those brief spurts of hilarity, and got started on her speech. Unfortunately, when she got to the bit about the night lasting forever, it was too much to take and every single pony in the hall burst into uncontrollable guffaws.</p><p class="double">“Hmph!” she said, turning up her nose and flouncing out, chased by laughter.</p><p class="double">It took quite a long time. After all, she was only filly sized, and that meant a lot of steps to get off the stage.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How was that?” Nyx asked, reclaiming her glasses and hairband from Twilight backstage.</p><p class="double">“I think it went pretty well,” Twilight replied. “Maybe if you hadn’t had a squeaky voice as well it might have been touch-and-go, but that was the masterpiece.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed,” Luna said. “Actually, would you handle all my public appearances this Loop?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Would</i> I?” Nyx repeated, giggling.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There was a crack of thunder and a flash of lightning, and several ponies flinched back as the chariot came stooping out of the sky.</p><p class="double">Then they paused.</p><p class="double">“What?” Nyx asked, ostentatiously paying no attention to her pumpkin costume. “Oh, am I not scary enough? Grrr.”</p><p class="double">Somehow, it seemed like the ponies of Ponyville were not as terrified as they might perhaps have been.</p><p class="double">Nyx rolled her eyes, making the costume fluff out. “Oh, sure, it’s fine for a pony to dress up as a chicken, but you get the deity of the night coming to her own festival as a pumpkin and suddenly they’re ‘not in the spirit of the holiday’. Well, hmph.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, did I miss anything?” Nyx asked, wings whirring frantically as she landed in front of the Elements.</p><p class="double">Celestia just gave her a look.</p><p class="double">“…wow, the party must have been awesome to demolish half the castle like this! How come you didn’t wake me up?” Nyx looked upset. “Is it ‘cause I don’t look old enough to be allowed alcohol? And that’s a stupid rule by the way, I’m totally old enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I just…” Scootaloo shrugged desperately. “I want Dash to like me, but it seems like I just can’t get her to treat me how I want.”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Nyx frowned, clearly thinking hard. “In my experience, nothing helps you connect with a sister figure like turning evil, becoming corrupted by your own power, confronting your sister, fighting her, losing, being banished to the moon by the Elements of Harmony for a thousand years, shrinking, coming back to Equestria in a hilariously abortive attempt at a coup…” she paused. “I might have forgotten the next bit, but anyway it <i>does</i> work. Could be tricky to arrange, though. Do you have super powers?”</p><p class="double">“No,” Scootaloo deadpanned.</p><p class="double">“Well, we could start with that.” Nyx smiled encouragingly. “Maybe we could get Pinkie to make you a gyrocopter, and you could be Gyrocopter Pony, the Pony with a Gyrocopter.”</p><p class="double">At Scootaloo’s look, Nyx shrugged. “I don’t exactly have much to go on here, work with me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.3 (Nutjob)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...forever!&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare laughed maniacally as the ponies gathered below her cowered in her presence. It was over. Celestia was defeated, locked within her own accursed sun before the black alicorn halted the infernal orb below Equestria’s horizon altogether. Soon, she would be forgotten, and the sun would be nothing more than a old pony’s tale. Her subjects would learn to appreciate her night, and she would get the respect and adoration she <i><b>deserved! </b></i></p><p class="double">“Excuse me, Your Majesty?” a voice called out. The kingdom’s new monarch looked down at the crowd gathered below. A purple unicorn was smiling back up at her. “Hello! I&#039;m so glad to finally make your acquaintance, Your Majesty. My name is Twilight Sparkle, and I&#039;m positively honored to be able to offer my services to the crown.” The unicorn bowed respectfully. </p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon raised an eyebrow in confusion. This... Twilight Sparkle seemed unnaturally calm compared to everypony else in the room, as though she had been expecting her. And what services was she referring to? The alicorn shook her head. It didn&#039;t matter, one of her new subjects was already warming up to her. This presented an opportunity. Reward this subject for her loyalty and more would follow. &quot;Rise, Twilight Sparkle. Your new queen is pleased to see that there are ponies such as yourself that are prepared to embrace her gift of eternal night.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn looked up at her once again, beaming from the praise. Around her, Nightmare Moon could she the crowd glaring at her, and heard the word &quot;traitor&quot; uttered more than once, but the unicorn paid them no heed. &quot;Thank you, Your Majesty. That means a lot.&quot; Twilight produced a pocket watch, and glanced at it. “It looks like you arrived not a minute too soon. I think it&#039;s best that we get started right away.”</p><p class="double">&quot;Get started with... what, exactly?&quot; Nightmare Moon asked, cocking her head.</p><p class="double">This time, it was Twilight’s turn to look confused. “Wait, didn’t your sister tell you?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked at that. Her sister? Come to think of it…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>A black alicorn appeared in a brilliant flash of light.</i></p><p class="double"><i>“<b>I… have… returned!</b>” she shouted into the air.</i></p><p class="double"><i>“Luna! There you are.” Nightmare Moon to face the voice. Her. Oh course she would be here, but she would not be victorious again. “Oh, I’m so glad to see you again. I have missed you so much, dear sister. Listen, I know you are angry with me, but you should know I scheduled an appointment with-”</i></p><p class="double"><i>The white alicorn disappeared when she was struck by a beam of dark blue magic. “<b>To the sun with you!</b>”</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“No, she did not mention anything about this at all.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn sighed and shook her head. “It’s just like her to leave me to explain everything. Alright, I’m sorry, you’re probably confused. Let me reintroduce myself. I’m Twilight Sparkle, Royal Psychologist.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...all those evenings I spent pouring my heart and soul into the sky, making the stars shimmer and sparkle and crafting beautiful constellations, and... and... *sniff* ...and they just slept through it! Every single night!&quot; Nightmare Moon sobbed. Twilight levitated over a box of tissues. The black alicorn pause her story for a moment to dry her eyes and clean her runny nose. “Thank you… *sniff* I just… I just wanted everypony to see what I created. My sister… she always got all the attention. Everypony thanked her for the sun and the light it brought. But nopony ever thanked me for the moon or the stars. I thought if I just kept trying to make it more beautiful, somepony would notice eventually but… but no matter how hard I tried I… they...”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon broke down into another tearful fit. Inwardly, Twilight was actually quite pleased with her current progress this loop. The hardest part of this plan, getting the Luna’s egotistical dark persona to submit herself to therapy, was already out of the way. Sure, while the black alicorn may have <i>initially</i> responded by trying to take her head off with a blast of focused magical energy for having dared suggest that her new queen’s mental state was anything short of perfection, spending several lifetimes replacing Celestia during her rule over Equestria had made her quite the diplomat.</p><p class="double">Talking her down hadn&#039;t been easy, but by playing the scared, helpless unicorn who was only trying to serve her new queen, she had managed to calm Nightmare Moon down enough to stop her destructive rampage. After that, coaxing her into attending the session had been a matter of careful word choices, ego stroking, a few hypothetical scenarios, and a cheerful attitude sprinkled with hints of adoration. Even under the dark influence of the nightmare, Luna, at her core, had still only truly desired some appreciation and attention. After she agreed, Twilight was actually surprised how quickly she opened up. It made her wonder whether or not Celestia had tried this <i>before</i> banishing her sister to the moon for a thousand years. Something to ask about.</p><p class="double">Either way, seeing the black alicorn sobbing in the middle of her tree (which she converted into a makeshift office) was something she wished her friends were here to see. Well, her looping ones, anyway. Their non-looping selves, Spike included, were peeking in through a window (she pretended not to notice), but it wasn’t quite the same. It would at least it would make for a good story, but things were starting to drag on, so it was time to make a move.</p><p class="double">“Luna… May I call you Luna?” She paused to let Nightmare Moon answer. The alicorn hesitated for a bit, but eventually nodded. Twilight smiled, this was a good sign. “I completely understand your desire to have your work validated. To see something you put so much work into completely ignored must have been devastating. You mentioned that your sister received plenty of attention for raising the sun. Do you think it would have hurt as much to have everypony ignore the night if that weren’t true?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was slow to answer. “Well it… it still would have hurt but… I… I suppose that seeing Tia getting all that attention might have made it worse…”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Would you say you were envious of the attention she was getting?” she asked, careful not to make it sound like an accusation.</p><p class="double">“M-maybe…” she said, but the way she sank into the chaise lounge implied a more definitive answer.</p><p class="double">“Did you ever tell her you were feeling neglected back then?”</p><p class="double">“She… she knew.”</p><p class="double">“Are you certain?” Twilight pressed.</p><p class="double">“Tia… Celestia knew everything... She... Nothing ever happened in the entire kingdom without her knowing about it… She had to know…” she answered, but her words sounded uncertain.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Perhaps that she was so busy maintaining a presence in Equestria’s politics was the reason she hadn’t noticed how you felt? Sometimes a pony can get so wrapped up in their work that they fail to notice how their friends and family are hurting.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon seemed to consider this, but didn’t respond at all. Objective one complete. Now for the other matter… “So then, this plan of yours, to make nighttime eternal, this is another attempt to get more ponies to notice the night sky?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon nodded. “Yes. They won’t be able to ignore the night anymore if it lasts forever.”</p><p class="double">“But don’t you think that could be counter-productive?” Nightmare Moon looked at her and raised an eyebrow. “What I mean is, ponies might <i>notice </i>the night sky, but since it comes at the cost of the day and the sun, it could cause them to resent it instead of admire it like you wanted.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon huffed. “Then so be it. They ignored me night after night and spent all of their time in the sun. They never cared about me, so why should I care about how they feel?”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a small smile. “You don’t mean that.”</p><p class="double">“You don’t know me.” she said, turning away.</p><p class="double">“No, but I know you care deeply about every one of your subjects. I know you were there fighting Discord alongside your sister,” she said. Nightmare Moon’s ears perked up, and she turned back towards Twilight.</p><p class="double">“You know about that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I do.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon stared at her for a moment, then turned away again. “Yes, I was there. And for a while, the ponies seemed to love me too. But years passed. Decades. Centuries, and I was forgotten. And as their love for me faded, so did mine.”</p><p class="double">“And yet, when you heard about King Sombra and the way he enslaved the Crystal Empire, you once again threw yourself against a powerful enemy in order to protect them,” Twilight added. “If what you say were true, you would have felt no obligation to help them.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon faced Twilight again with a disbelieving look on her face. “How do you know all this?”</p><p class="double">“Because I’ve been very thorough in researching my homeland’s history,” she said simply. It was at least partially true, but she felt it was best not to mention the whole truth for the moment. “You had no obligation to save Equestria from Discord. You could have left the ponies, my ancestor’s at his mercy and looked for a new land to settle in. But you saw ponies suffering under the rule of a reality-bending tyrant, and you, along with your sister, wanted to protect them. Not so you could rule over them, you did it because you couldn’t stand to see them in pain. It was the same for the Crystal Empire, am I right?”</p><p class="double">“I… yes…” she admitted. “But we failed. The Crystal Empire is gone.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe, but you protected Equestria from a potential invasion from King Sombra’s slave army. And more importantly, you fought for them. Your subjects, and the crystal ponies. You <i>did</i> care. And while the history books are vague on the exact dates of the events, the fall of the Crystal Empire and your rise as Nightmare Moon were what, a year apart? Two? Certainly not long enough for you to divorce yourself of that protective nature and empathy.” Nightmare Moon’s gaze met the floor. Twilight took that as a “yes”. “And your sister’s public presence? I’m willing to bet that one of the reasons that she managed to maintain such an outward image was because you were helping to keep Equestria running smoothly outside the public eye, correct?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was silent for a long while, then she spoke. “It doesn’t matter. I’ve already made my choice,” she nearly whispered.</p><p class="double">“But it does matter! It matters to <i>you</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Stop…”</p><p class="double">“You still care about them. About us, don’t you? You never <i>stopped</i> caring.”</p><p class="double">“I said stop!”</p><p class="double">“And that’s why it hurt so much. You <i>adored</i> your subjects, and yet they never seemed to return your affections. Even your sister didn’t seem to have as much time for you anymore.”</p><p class="double">“Please! Just stop talking!”</p><p class="double">“And that’s why you did it, isn’t it? The pain just became too much. You couldn’t hold it in any longer. So you thought, since loving them was too painful to bear, maybe you could try hating them instead. Scorning them. Replacing your unrequited affections with something less painful.”</p><p class="double">“<i><b>Be silent!</b></i>” Nightmare Moon boomed, getting to her feet and standing over the unicorn with a brightly glowing horn. She attempted to look as threatening as possible, and to a younger pony she may have. Twilight, however, was not young. She could see that the alicorn’s glare lacked a certain heat to it, her eyes were starting to well, and the subtle twitches of her mouth were clear indicators that she was struggling to keep her emotions under control. The floodgates were about to burst.</p><p class="double">“It won’t work, Princess. You can’t simply stop caring about them like that. Somepony like you, who loves her subjects with all her heart, could never bring herself to truly hate them, no matter how they wronged her.”</p><p class="double">“S-stop…” she said, her voice cracking. “I-if you don’t… I’ll…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “No, you won’t. Because you care. Because you would never forgive yourself if you did,” she spoke softly, and gave a soft smile. “And I care about you, too, Luna. So please, let me help you.”</p><p class="double">“H-help m-me?” she stammered.</p><p class="double">“Yes, help you. Please.” She stood up off her chair. “Let me be your friend.”</p><p class="double">Any hint of aggression melted away right there. Nightmare Moon opened her mouth, but only a small hiccup escaped. She tried to regain her composure, closing her mouth and squeezing her eyes shut to hold back the tears, but it was too late. Her legs buckled under her and she fell to the floor weeping. Twilight slowly moved beside her, and leaned down, gently stroking her back.</p><p class="double">“It’s okay. Let it all out.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn kept crying for several minutes, with Twilight by her side to comfort her. As the minutes passed, Twilight noticed that the black mare’s coat was disappearing, the corruption seeping down her coat like runny makeup onto the floor. Before long, all that was left of Nightmare Moon was a puddle of black on the floor and armor far too large for Luna’s redeemed form.</p><p class="double">“I’m sorry… I’m so sorry,” she whimpered, clinging to Twilight and crying into her chest. “I’m a horrible pony… I..”</p><p class="double">“None of that,” Twilight commanded, but kept her voice low. “You’re a wonderful pony, Luna. Equestria was worse off without you, and we’re lucky to have you back.”</p><p class="double">“Those ponies… they’ll never forgive me… Tia will never forgive me…”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “Oh yes they will. You haven’t done anything that can’t be fixed. And once they meet you, the <i>real</i> you, I know they’ll warm up to you, too.” Twilight turned towards her window. &quot;Right, everypony?&quot;</p><p class="double">Realizing they&#039;d been spotted, Twilight&#039;s non-looping PFFs and number one assistant ducked beneath the window frame. Twilight rolled her eyes. As if she hadn&#039;t already seen them and called them out. &quot;Come on girls. You were all so wonderful to me when I got here this morning. Princess Luna needs that now more than I ever did, you aren’t going to deny her friendship over a choice she regrets making, are you? And I <i>know</i> I taught you better than that, Spike. The door&#039;s unlocked. Come inside.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence once again overtook the library turned psychiatrists office. Luna gave Twilight a worried look, but the unicorn assured her that they’d come. After a few moments passed, but the group finally proved her right. They walked in slowly, and stood in front of the pair, their eyes wandering between Luna, Twilight and each other as they tried to decide what to say. </p><p class="double">Twilight decided to help move things along. “Princess Luna, these are my friends. The baby dragon is Spike, my number one assistant. He was raised by your sister until she put him under my care. The five ponies are my friends. I only just met them when I came into Ponyville, but they’ve been some of the kindest and friendliest souls I’ve ever met. They can help you win back Ponyville’s trust.”</p><p class="double">Spike stepped up first. “Well, I’m not sure how I can help but, I forgive you. You don’t seem like a bad pony to me, and Twilight’s right. Your sister helped raise me, and she taught me better than to hold a grudge against somepony that just made a bad choice.”</p><p class="double">“Ab-so-lutely!” Applejack exclaimed, moving forward and smiling at Luna. “Ah know Ah probably haven’t given the night the attention it rightly deserves, but Ah reckon without it, the sun would just shrivel everythin’ Ah try tah grow right up. Ah figure ah owe you big for that, so forgivin’ yah is just the start of it fer me.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, what she said,” Rainbow Dash added. “I’m uhh, I’m not too good at these kinds of speeches, but I totally get what it’s like to have something awesome you make go unnoticed. I mean, when I was a filly, I did a sonic rainboom, and nopony noticed.” She threw her hooves up. “It’s a <i>giant rainbow explosion in the sky!</i> How do you <i>miss</i> that!?” She let out a big sigh. “Anyway, yeah, I totally get where you’re coming from, so I forgive you, too.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed, I can only imagine how it would feel if every single one of my works were ignored,” Rarity stated as she walked up to Luna and inspected the oversized armor she was wearing. “Although I have to say, your taste in accessories could use some work.” She levitated the helmet and armor off of the alicorn. “Stand up, dear? Good, now let’s get you out of that tacky footwear. Yes, that’s better. Hmm, those ponies don’t know what they’re missing. Why, with a coat like yours, and a little work, I’m certain you could shine brighter than the sun. Figuratively speaking, of course.”</p><p class="double">“And I’ll throw you a big ‘Welcome to Ponyville/Welcome Back to Equestria/Thanks for Not Making Night Last Forever’ Party!” Pinkie shouted. To illustrate her point, she pulled a cord that released a bunch of streamers, balloons, confetti and a “Welcome to Ponyville/Welcome Back to Equestria/Thanks for Not Making Night Last Forever!” banner from the ceiling. Everypony stared at her in disbelief.</p><p class="double">“But when-” Twilight began to ask, but stopped herself. No matter how many loops she went through she would never get a satisfactory answer to Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued. “Don’t worry, everypony comes to my parties, and it will be a great chance for everypony to get to know you and have a great time doing it!”</p><p class="double">Luna stared at Pinkie for a second, then looked at the one pony in the room who had yet to speak. “And you? Do you forgive me, too?”</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus hid behind her own mane even as she answered. “Um… Yes. I wasn’t ever really angry. I was more worried about my animal friends. Some of them don’t see very well at night. But um, I’m glad you aren’t doing that anymore. Thank you.”</p><p class="double">Luna looked at each of her seven new friends and, finally, gave them a small, touched smile. “Thank you. Thank you all so much.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie latched onto her new Princess/friend in a big hug, surprising Luna. Twilight followed next, then Spike, Rarity, and eventually the whole group. With all her new friends embracing her, some fresh tears began to form in the night Princess’s eyes. Ones not of sadness, but of joy. Happier than she could remember being for millennia, Luna hugged them back. She finally had everything she ever wanted. Who would have known it would be so easy?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“I can’t believe what you’ve managed to accomplish today, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia and Twilight sat side by side as the Summer Sun Celebration went into full swing. Princess Luna herself was engaging in many of the festivities along with her new friends, as well as several townsfolk that had since taken a liking to her. Currently, that meant going head to head with Pinkie in a cupcake eating contest, with half the town cheering them on.</p><p class="double">“It was nothing, really Princess. You sister just needed a friend. I knew I could get to her.”</p><p class="double">“I have to admit, when you came to me saying you could redeem Luna without the Elements of Harmony I was very confused. You knew so much I thought I had hidden from you so well. I honestly feared for <i>your </i>mental state when you began to talk about these… time loops.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “But you always give me the benefit of the doubt. And look at the results.”</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled. “Indeed. If only I had known the answer was so simple.”</p><p class="double">“Speaking of which, I have you scheduled to join us at our next session on Tuesday.”</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked and looked down at Twilight. “Wait, <i>me?</i> But-”</p><p class="double">Twilight held up a hoof to cut her off. “Now, now, I won’t take no for an answer. I’m sensing centuries of bad air between you two, and I intend to see you two through it. The sooner we get this out of the way the better. Procrastination isn’t going to help anypony.” She said with finality. “I’m going to go and join my friends. Enjoy the festival, Princess!”</p><p class="double">With that, Twilight trotted away, leaving a shocked Princess Celestia behind her. Twilight giggled to herself. Sometimes looping could be so much fun. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>28.4 (NutJob)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>(Youngster Quartet, Part 1)</b></p><p class="double">“Okay, seriously, what the fluffy kittens is up with this loop?”</p><p class="double">Twilight managed to suppress a laugh, barely, to spare her rainbow-hued friend from further humiliation. They were walking through Ponyville in what was quickly becoming a contender for the most bizarre loop Twilight has ever experienced, and considering the weight that statement alone carried with it she could understand her friend’s aggravation.</p><p class="double">The loop itself seemed fairly standard at first. She awoke in Ponyville alongside Spike, and a quick check revealed that the other Elements were Awake as well. While it was unusual Awakening in Ponyville, she had certainly awoken to some far less welcome sights. Things only started to get weird when the other loopers started showing up.</p><p class="double">Twilight recognized many of them, familiar faces from past adventures and old friends she’d been hoping to see again for… Well, to be honest she wasn’t sure. Keeping track of time was difficult as a looper. Others were new faces, some eager to become friends, some new, inexperienced loopers, and some were kind of moody jerks, and every single one of them retained their original form. In any case, Ponyville quickly became flooded with them, and eventually Twilight had to inform Mayor Mare that Ponyville had apparently become the temporary home of several… hundred interdimensional travelers, each with a multitude of lifetime experiences with varying degrees of mental stability. All things considered, she took it quite well after Twilight pointed out granting them residency in Ponyville would secure the majority vote in the coming election. At the time, the looping unicorn thought her biggest challenge would be to prevent so many people from so many cultures from tearing each others eyes out.</p><p class="double">This was before she discovered the loops second oddity.</p><p class="double">“Oh, man,” Rainbow moaned, covering her face with her hooves. “I can&#039;t believe I said that to him. I’m never going to live this down.”</p><p class="double">On top of being the single biggest example of a fused loop she had ever seen, it was also an altered loop with some very strange rules. As far as she could tell no one, whether they be pony, human or otherwise, could say or perform any action that might be considered &quot;inappropriate for children&quot;. On top of that, some of the items the loopers had brought with them had been physically altered, as well. Weapons turned into toys or candy, for example, or cigarettes into lollipops. At first, Twilight thought that one of the loopers might have been responsible for everyone&#039;s uncharacteristic behavior, but after she got word of other parts of Equestria being affected, and several thorough tests of her new neighbors abilities, she concluded that none of them had the resources or power needed to pull off such a feat. At least not without using a massive amount of easily traceable energy, which there was no evidence of.</p><p class="double">It took some time, but eventually most of the loopers had found ways to deal with it. Most treated the loop as a vacation, as the universe was forced into a state of perpetual peace, and the Princesses (Thankfully, also Awake) and mayor helped see to it that each of them was well accommodated. Still, there were a fair amount of troublemakers that tried to “overload” the loop’s censorship, which usually just resulted in their words and actions being more heavily altered, but that didn’t stop them from trying. And when one such looper had started instigating Rainbow Dash, it quickly devolved into what would have been a heated argument between the two, had the universe not decided to make things awkward for them.</p><p class="double">“Oh, come on, Rainbow. It wasn’t that bad! Some of the other loopers have been thrown into far more embarrassing situations than you,” Twilight offered. “Remember when Laharl and Etna accidentally promised to start a circus?&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a smile out of the pegasus. Baby steps. “Yeah, that was great. Flonne wouldn’t let that one go until they made it happen. Gotta admit, Midboss and Pinkie were great on the trapeze.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I thought Captain Gordon made a great clown, myself. And how about that time Megatron transformed into a Carousel?”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash let out a chuckle. Almost there. “Okay, yeah. I don’t think anyone saw that coming.”</p><p class="double">“And need I remind you about the nine-tailed fox?” she snickered, pointing a hoof towards the Everfree forest, where the remains of the worlds biggest piñata was visible over the treeline.</p><p class="double">This finally seemed to get the pegasus’s thoughts off of her earlier humiliation long enough to share a short but refreshing laugh with her unicorn friend. “Okay, okay, yeah. I mean, I guess I don’t have it too bad compared to all that,” she admitted.</p><p class="double">“Exactly,” Twilight agreed, smiling. “Besides, I’m sure Wolverine knows you didn&#039;t actually mean any of that.&quot; Her smile suddenly transformed into a mischievous grin. &quot;Although I have to say I&#039;m sure it would have been quite the wedding.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus cheeks went from light blue to bright red and she shot Twilight a glare that could melt glaciers. Thankfully, as a countless number of loops had made her considerably more resilient and an oversized block of ice, the unicorn felt comfortable staring back smugly. Still, it was short-lived, as the second Rainbow Dash opened her mouth to retort she was blindsided by an orange blur that sent her crashing several yards through the ground.</p><p class="double">For an instance, Twilight worried that someone had actually succeeded in beating the universal censorship, but one look into the newly formed trench and those fears were lifted. She would recognize that black, spiky hair anywhere, and she knew its owner wasn&#039;t the type to attack someone out of the blue.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops. Sorry, Rainbow Dash. That was a little rougher than I was going for.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh, Goku!? What the happy meals is wrong with you? And what are you hugging me for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s because...&quot; the saiyan trailed off, his face twisting in confusion. “Actually, I’m not sure. I just felt like I really had to hug you, for some reason.”</p><p class="double">“What? But that-” she started, confused, before she put the pieces together and her expression morphed into one of irritation. <i><b>“Pinkie Pie!”</b></i></p><p class="double">“Yessssss, Rainbow Dash?” the pink mare responded, poking her head out from the mound of dirt that had been created beside the trench.</p><p class="double">“Did you write my name in the Hug Note again!?”</p><p class="double">“Mmmmaaayyyyyybe.”</p><p class="double">For the second time in five minutes, Twilight found herself resisting the urge to laugh. And judging from the snickering she heard coming from behind her, she wasn’t the only one. By this point a mass of ponies and visiting loopers had gathered around the crash site. She knew most of them had been drawn by good intentions, rushing over to offer help if someone had been injured, and although tempting as it was to let them stick around and enjoy the show, she felt Rainbow Dash’s ego had taken enough of a beating for one day.</p><p class="double">“Okay, everyone! Nothing to see here, move along now!” she called out, shooing the onlookers away. The crowd slowly started to disperse, with several ponies and especially loopers trying to sneak a few more glances before Twilight personally forced them away. Once they were free of any unwelcome onlookers, Twilight turned back and climbed into the trench to assist her friends.</p><p class="double">“Goku, you mind getting off me now?” Rainbow Dash asked with a hint of irritation in her voice.</p><p class="double">“Uh, yeah.” Goku sheepishly rose to his feet. After helping Rainbow Dash off the ground, the saiyan scratched the back of his head. “Heheh… Uh, sorry about all that.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash waved her hoof. “Don’t worry about it. It wasn’t really your fault anyway. I’m gonna have a talk with-” She was cut off as Goku suddenly scooped the pegasus off the and pulled her against his chest once again. The two stared at each blankly for a moment, before Goku offered Rainbow Dash an apologetic smile, and Rainbow Dash closed her eyes and gritted her teeth in irritation. “<i>Pinkie Pie.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Wud?” the earth pony asked, looking up from her notebook with a pen clenched in her teeth.</p><p class="double">“Pinkie, don’t you think poor Rainbow Dash has had enough hugs for one day?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“That’s silly, Twilight! Nopony can <i>ever</i> get enough hugs in one day!” Pinkie replied, causing Twilight to roll her eyes. “Besides, I know what you’re <i>really </i>asking. And don’t worry, I wrote your name in here right after Dashie’s!”</p><p class="double">“Pinkie!”</p><p class="double">“Also, I hope you don’t mind but I really wanted to see what would happen if I wrote someone’s name more than once.”</p><p class="double">“You wrote my name in the Note <i>twice</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Noooooooooooo.”</p><p class="double">“What? But then…”</p><p class="double">Twilight was distracted by the distant sound of rumbling. Suddenly, the meaning of of Pinkie’s words became all too clear. “Pinkie… How many times did you write my name in there?”</p><p class="double">“Um, I wasn’t keeping track. Oh, I know, why don’t you ask them?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie pointed behind Twilight. The unicorn almost didn’t look, as she had a pretty good idea as to who “they” were, considering that Pinkie had pointed in the direction of the rumbling. <i>I could just teleport away, right now, </i>she thought. <i>Maybe to Canterlot, or the Crystal Empire. Or the moon.</i> All seemed like, at this particular point in time, a much safer place to be. But realistically, she knew it wouldn’t help. Once her name was written in the notebook her fate was sealed, and with all the loopers and their means of transportation it wasn’t as though she could run, either. She took in a deep breath and turned around.</p><p class="double">And saw the entire population of Ponyville running at her as if someone cast the Want-It-Need-It spell on her.</p><p class="double">“Oh <i>fluff me</i>.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“...and I promise never to write anyone’s name in the Hug Note more than once at one time ever again. Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.” Pinkie finished, going through all the necessary motions.</p><p class="double">“Good, thank you Pinkie. Could you go let Spike know I won’t be home for a few days?”</p><p class="double">“Sure. Sorry again, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“That’s okay, Pinkie.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded slowly and left, and Twilight let out a sigh as Nurse Redheart finish adjusting her bed. Now this was something. How many lifetimes has it been since the last time she wore a full body cast? Of all the thousands of horrible loops she could have ended up confined to a hospital bed, this was about the <i>last</i> loop she would have considered this a possibility. Oh well, it wasn’t as though she was terribly busy this loop.</p><p class="double">“I don’t see why you don’t just Ascend or cast a bone-mending spell or something,” Rainbow Dash stated. “If you’re afraid that you’ll mess up your magic or something like that, I can do it for you. Just tell me how the spell works, I’ll go Ascend and have you back up in a jiffy.”</p><p class="double">“It’s not that, Rainbow, but thank you.” Rainbow Dash raised an eyebrow at this, so Twilight continued. “Right now, crazy as it sounds, Pinkie Pie is the most dangerous threat to Equestria. The Hug Note is one of the few things in this entire loop that’s capable of actually hurting someone, and Pinkie was treating it like a toy. In all honesty, I’m just glad that she learned this lesson with me and not someone else.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, well, she Pinkie promised not to do it again. Do you really need to stick around here now?</p><p class="double">“She Pinkie promised not to write anyone’s name more than once at one time, but she’s started experimenting with the notebook and that’s a problem in itself. What if she decides somebody needs a <i>really</i> big hug? You want to find out what it feels like to be hugged by a gundam?” Rainbow Dash answered with a wince. “I thought not. As for my decision to stay here, well, let’s face it. Part of Pinkie’s charm is that even despite being technically older than the Princesses at this point, she hasn’t seemed to grow up one bit. I don’t want her thinking that what happened wasn’t a big deal just because I can fix it right away. I’m hoping that staying here a couple of days will make her think her actions through a little better in the future.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash mused that over. “I guess that makes sense. Alright, well if you’re sure, anything you need me to grab for you before I head out?”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm… actually, now that I think about it, could you stop by the library and grab as many erotic books as you can find? I want to see how the loop affected them. It should be good for a laugh.”</p><p class="double">“Ha! That’s sounds like fun, maybe I’ll join you. Alright, I’ll be back in a minute. Don’t go anywhere!” the pegasus teased as she opened a window and flew out.”</p><p class="double">“Oh hah, hah!” she called back, knowing full well her friend was already well out of earshot. Still, an amused smile formed on her face. This was surely one of the stranger loops she’d ever experienced, but also easily one of the most peaceful. To be honest, it was nice to be able to just relax with no strings attached. One loop where she could just pretend she was a normal unicorn that didn’t have to constantly fight chaotic gods and eldritch abominations. She took notice a small glass of water on a table beside her, and telekinetically raise it to the air.</p><p class="double">“Here’s to you, you wonderfully bizarre flopping loop.”</p><p class="double"></p><p>28.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle walked down the stairs to the dungeons, shooting Celestia a worried look. &quot;And you&#039;re saying this... assassin wanted to talk to me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... to be completely accurate, she wanted to speak to Princess Twilight.&quot; The alicorn of the sun looked down at her student. &quot;I hardly know of any such pony, but given that you are my student I assumed there could be a level of... confusion regarding your rank.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn nodded, keeping her thoughts to herself. Celestia wasn&#039;t awake this loop, so of course she was unaware of Twilight&#039;s more powerful abilities. The fact that this prisoner <i>was</i> implied that she was looping, but being referred to as Princess by any of her friends was quite unusual. Therefore, it wouldn&#039;t be out of the question to assume that the assassin was a new looper...</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you ever figure out why she attacked you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia sighed. &quot;Apparently I&#039;m... some sort of tyrant that enslaves ponies. And I managed to escape from the moon and rewrite history somehow. I think she may be a tad delusional....&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced, remembering a rather disturbing loop. If the pony in question had woken up <i>then,</i> there was plenty of reason to distrust Celestia. &quot;So... what exactly is this pony like, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s the thing,&quot; her mentor said sadly. &quot;She&#039;s not a pony.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh raised an eyebrow, quietly refilling the mug with cider as Twilight gently patted the shoulders of a sobbing, heartbroken Chrysalis.</p><p class="double">He didn&#039;t exactly have a full understanding of the situation--it wasn&#039;t his place to pry--but from what he had gathered, the last loop that the changeling queen had been in had her married to Shining Armor, of all ponies. Shining hadn&#039;t been Awake, of course, but Chrysalis had been. In fact, if he was reading this right, that was her <i>first</i> loop, and she had interpreted her memories of the baseline loop as some horrific nightmare.</p><p class="double">And then she&#039;d woken up here, once again Queen of the Changeling Swarm and....</p><p class="double">&quot;I AM A MOOOOOOOOOOOONSTEEEEEEEEER!&quot; Chrysalis wailed. She heaved forward with another sob, her silky mane spooling around and into the mug. &quot;I don&#039;t deserve to live; I don&#039;t deserve any, any of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, Chrysalis, you&#039;re not really that bad.&quot; Twilight rubbed her shoulders gently, watching as she took another gulp of alcohol. &quot;As... aggressive as your invasion plan usually is, it&#039;s always started by a need to feed your hive. You just... have a few, um... sympathy issues, that&#039;s all.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shot Macintosh the look of the desperately flailing. He coughed and nodded. &quot;Family is family. Ah can&#039;t tell ya how many loops I fought off timberwolves or joined tha army to protect Apple Bloom and AJ. Ya&#039;ll were acting in tha best interests of yer kin, Ah can respect that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sniffed. &quot;You... you really think that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure as tha sun.&quot; The stallion nodded. &quot;You look after yer own. Ya just need ta learn ta look after others, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a vague nod, the queen of the changelings straightened slightly.</p><p class="double">Then she broke down crying again. &quot;But, but, but.... Shining. I loved... loved him, and... and it turns out that I, was just playing him--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>That</i> Shining Armor loved you too,&quot; Twilight interjected quickly. &quot;<i>That</i> Shining Armor was somepony that you... What I&#039;m saying is, you didn&#039;t hurt him. I was in that loop, Chrysalis, and I saw how deeply you two were....&quot; She sighed. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I really am. He wasn&#039;t awake that loop, so the looping version of him won&#039;t... remember. Just... you didn&#039;t hurt him, remember that. In that loop, you didn&#039;t--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance was awake, wasn&#039;t she?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn snapped her mouth shut.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis turned to glower at her. &quot;Wasn&#039;t. She.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, very reluctantly, gave a small nod.</p><p class="double">The changeling nodded back. &quot;I&#039;m a monster. I&#039;m a complete... complete monster...&quot; She reached for her mug again.</p><p class="double">Macintosh pulled it out of her reach with a snort. &quot;So what? Ya think just cause ya made a few mistakes ya&#039;ll can just take the monster label and run with it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. &quot;It&#039;s not like I have a choice.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya know what Ah saw when Ah started looping?&quot; Macintosh pointed at the unicorn. &quot;This pony right here transformed into a Nightmare. Called herself Eternal Twilight, turned Spike into a massive dragon... Ah was completely terrified. Turned out ta be a one-loop prank she was pulling.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aheh heh heh.&quot; The mare inched away from Chrysalis&#039;s incredulous look. &quot;Looping does kind of make ponies a tad crazy...&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh rolled her eyes. &quot;It wasn&#039;t till a lot later that Twilight even figgered Ah was looping. And that was only cause she noticed a lot of things that weren&#039;t happening that shoulda been. Ah&#039;d been so terrified of her that Ah&#039;d tried ta keep mah whole condition secret... and it turned out she was, well, Twilight. Not some evil monster, but just a pony that happened ta have been living tha same period over and over again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shut her eyes, rubbing at them with a hoof. &quot;What exactly are you trying to say here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;m saying... Look. Even if ya <i>are</i> a monster, you can change. Ah mean, even tha baseline has Nightmare Moon and Discord reforming.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because they made friends,&quot; the changeling queen grumbled. &quot;Or got shot in the face with the Elements.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then make some friends!&quot; Twilight said brightly. &quot;Heck, I&#039;m sure Pinkie will warm up to you quickly. And Fluttershy <i>ascended</i> because of you, so now that you&#039;re looping she&#039;d love to chat.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. &quot;What do you mean Fluttershy ascended because of me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um... long story, but basically you can&#039;t turn into an alicorn unless you&#039;ve become an alicorn in a previous loop, and that kind of requires specific things for each pony, and Fluttershy is the element of Kindness so...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See?&quot; Macintosh pressed. &quot;Ya have some friends already. Heck, Twilight busted ya out of jail to drag ya here for a drink.&quot; He offered the mug back to her. &quot;That there takes some real nerve.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, technically I claimed she was my cousin who ended up messing with an experimental spell and, um, Celestia agreed to release her to my care.&quot; Twilight rubbed the back of her head. &quot;I&#039;m amazed she bought that.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen looked at the proffered cider. &quot;....I... I still love Shining. My version, anyway. The one in that loop, I don&#039;t know if the looping Shining is different... I&#039;m never going to get to find out, am I?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;No, I... I&#039;m afraid you won&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded slowly. &quot;Are... either of them awake this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn took a moment to consider the question. &quot;...Chrysalis... you&#039;re not going to be able to maintain a relationship with ponies when they&#039;re not awake. It just.... doesn&#039;t work, there&#039;s not a deep connection.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You didn&#039;t answer my question.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t want you to get hurt.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen took the mug and sipped it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look... let&#039;s just take it slowly, okay?&quot; Twilight smiled gently. &quot;Me and the other elements will deal with Nightmare Moon and Discord and Sombra and all those other things, but other then that this loop is to help you ease in. Alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I suppose I have to start somewhere,&quot; Chrysalis replied glumly. &quot;I doubt I could ever redeem myself...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.6</p><p class="double">“…I’d like to show you something…” Fluttershy said quietly.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis cocked her head, trying not to wince as another memory ran through her. She’d have to get used to them sooner or later, it wouldn’t be possible to have a conversation if every reminder of what she’d lost threw her off.</p><p class="double">Not to mention how much it might confuse the rest of the hive mind.</p><p class="double">“What is it?” she asked, pushing her reminiscence aside as best she could.</p><p class="double">“Watch.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy’s eyes closed, and she exhaled deeply and evenly.</p><p class="double">There was a moment of timeless fluidity, and then there was a wolf standing there.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis jumped, her wings buzzing. “What-”</p><p class="double">The wolf’s tongue lolled out for a moment, and Chrysalis noticed the laughter in its eyes.</p><p class="double">“It’s still me,” the wolf said in Fluttershy’s gentle soprano. “I picked this up somewhere. It’s called Wild Shape.”</p><p class="double">“…huh, it is,” the Changeling Queen said slowly. Now she was concentrating, her empathic sense could still detect the sunny warmth of Fluttershy’s emotions. “Where’d you learn that?”</p><p class="double">“Oerth.” The wolf sat back, gesturing with a paw, and Chrysalis landed again before stepping forwards. “It’s part of being what’s called a druid. I’m more… in tune with nature.”</p><p class="double">“Neat.” </p><p class="double">“Actually,” Fluttershy looked down, “I was wondering… what are the limits of your shapeshifting?”</p><p class="double">“I’ve never really tested them.” Chrysalis shrugged. “As far as I know, I can’t do much more than taking on the shape of a pony, though <i>what</i> pony is quite malleable.”</p><p class="double">She winced again. Even the smallest things seemed to be making her remember her loss. It wasn’t even clear <i>what</i> had done it that time…</p><p class="double">“Well,” there was another fluid moment, and Fluttershy was back to being a pegasus. “I think I know a project for us to work on. We could try and push the limits of what you can pull off, changing shape, I mean. If that’s okay with you.”</p><p class="double">“That does sound like a good idea,” Chrysalis nodded. “But why are you helping me?”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Fluttershy replied, genuinely puzzled – Chrysalis could sense the polite confusion like a pure musical note.</p><p class="double">“I… I invaded your country! Hundreds of times!”</p><p class="double">“No you didn’t.” Fluttershy reached out a hoof. “<i>You</i> haven’t. A not-Looping version of you did. You’re not guilty of her crimes.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. “I have to believe that you think that – I can <i>sense</i> that you believe that – but <i>I</i> don’t believe it myself.”</p><p class="double">“That’s okay.” Fluttershy giggled. “I used to be <i>terrible</i> at that. Okay, shall we do this?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shook her wings. “Not as though I have a choice, is it…”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no, I wouldn’t dream of forcing you.” Fluttershy backed off. “But you really <i>would</i> enjoy the challenge, I’m sure…”</p><p class="double">Then she got a mischievous glint in her eyes. Faint, but one that would startle somepony from the baseline loop. “And I do think that it might let you play a prank or two.”</p><p class="double">“Pranks?” Chrysalis repeated, feeling vaguely silly in having to ask so many questions.</p><p class="double">“Well, I don’t do them much myself, but I understand that Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie enjoy them, and they’re good to let off steam, and they don’t hurt anyone, and…”</p><p class="double">“Alright, I get the picture.” The Changeling Queen held up a hoof, cutting off Fluttershy’s long list. “Right, let’s get started. How is it that you’re changing the shape of the ears?”</p><p class="double">“Oh!” Fluttershy rummaged in her mane for a moment, and pulled a biology textbook from her subspace pocket. “Right, here. You see how the attachment of the muscles differs? Aside from that, the main issue is…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.7</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle sat back, kicking the table leg. It wasn’t much fun when the other Crusaders weren’t Looping, though on comparing notes they’d more or less mutually agreed that whichever one of them <i>was</i> looping should act like a cool big sister type of person. (Based on the reactions of the non-looping others, being around a pony their age who was clearly more self confident and yet who <i>wasn’t</i> condescending was actually pretty cool.)</p><p class="double">But the important thing was that she was waiting on her sister. Rarity had decided to upgrade their cloaks, and had asked Sweetie to take her next test examples over to their clubhouse… once they were finished with, anyway.</p><p class="double">There was a knock at the door.</p><p class="double">Sweetie glanced at the clock as she walked over. Five P.M. <i>Huh, must be taking her longer than she planned… it’ll be dinner soon, and if I’m going to go over to ‘bloom’s house for tea like I was going to then I’ll need to leave fairly sharpish.</i></p><p class="double">As she turned the handle, she rattled off the well-memorized message Rarity had taught her to. “Hello, welcome to Carousel Boutique. I’m afraid we’re not open right this moment, but we’ll take orders outside hours if… possible?”</p><p class="double">She trailed off, staring.</p><p class="double">“Spike? What are you doing here?”</p><p class="double">Spike looked down at Sweetie for a few seconds, then his eyes widened and he swept a bunch of lilies behind his back to hide them. “Oh, uh, Sweetie. Nice to see you.”</p><p class="double">“Do you have flowers behind your back?”</p><p class="double">“No…” Spike said slowly, in the face of evidence.</p><p class="double">“Whatever.” Sweetie shrugged. “Hey, sis! Your date’s here!”</p><p class="double">Rarity appeared with a flash of light. “Oh, sorry, I didn’t realize the time… wait, my what?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie rolled her eyes. “You two are <i>not</i> subtle. I’ve known for ages.”</p><p class="double">“You have?” both of them repeated in unison.</p><p class="double">“Hey, that was cool,” Sweetie said. “Anyway, yeah, it’s just <i>obvious</i> by now.”</p><p class="double">A grin stole across her face. “Wait, did you think you were managing to keep it secret from me?”</p><p class="double">“Er…” Spike scratched the back of his head with the hand not holding the flowers. “…yes, actually.”</p><p class="double">“I wasn’t sure what you’d think, Sweetie,” Rarity said with a blush. “I know I should have mentioned it, but…”</p><p class="double">“You were worried about that?” Sweetie looked Spike up and down. “He’s a dragon. That’s about as cool as potential brothers in law <i>get</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Fine, then…” Spike brought the flowers out. “Here, Rares. I know you like them.”</p><p class="double">The bouquet rose out of his hands wrapped in alabaster light. “I do, you’re right.” Selecting one from the centre of the bunch, Rarity nibbled it delicately and put the rest in a vase for later. “Much healthier than chocolates. Now, where are we going?”</p><p class="double">Spike produced a pair of tickets. “Well, it’s getting harder to find a new place to go, but… how do you feel about a classical music performance with Trixie doing a light and magic show?”</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked. “How did <i>that</i> come about?”</p><p class="double">“I am not entirely sure…” Spike shrugged. “Could be that Twilight sent Trixie off to that classicist-”</p><p class="double">“Octavia,” Rarity supplied.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that’s right. Twilight sent Trixie off to Octavia and her friend Vinyl after she turned up here. In any case, the programme says they’re doing Beethoofen, so that should be nice.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, that sounds fine.” Rarity paused. “I know it’s probably not as low profile as it could be, but… I’d actually like to fly there.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” At her nod, Spike tapped his chin. “Fair enough, then. Pegasus or alicorn?”</p><p class="double">“Pegasus.” Rarity matched deed to word, flashing through ascension and then down the other side with wings instead of her horn. “I do still feel nervous flying alone, I don’t think that’ll ever go away entirely, but… not with you.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie ostentatiously turned her back as the others shared a long look.</p><p class="double">“Hey,” she said, after a minute or so, “should I just head off to Applebloom’s, then?”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Rarity replied, distractedly. “You’ve got your key?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn filly got out of there in case they started kissing.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Beautiful, isn&#039;t it? Definitely one for the scrapbook.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two ponies looked down at the headline. <b>Great Red Spot Vanishes! Astronomers Baffled!</b></p><p class="double">&quot;How did you even… It&#039;s larger than Earth!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Was</i> larger than Earth.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.2</p><p class="double">“Right, that looks about done,” Trixie said, double-checking the calculations. “Right there.”</p><p class="double">“Cool,” Gilda said, bouncing a ball off the wall. “So this’ll work?”</p><p class="double">“…probably.” Trixie shrugged. “Not as though Trixie can test it ahead of time, is it?”</p><p class="double">“Fair point.” Flaring her wings, the griffin slapped the ball off to one side and pinged it with her tail. “So, when do we start?”</p><p class="double">“Tomorrow morning.” Trixie reached into nowhere, and pulled out a mini-barrel of beer. “One each for luck?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Gilda got the glasses out, and Trixie cracked the top to pour it.</p><p class="double">“I don’t remember seeing these before…” Gilda mused.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Trixie shrugged. “Applejack introduces them sometimes. They’re based off beer <i>cans</i>, which humans often use – but we just don’t have the aluminium extraction capacity to manage them easily, and we ponies prefer wood anyway.”</p><p class="double">“Huh. Cool.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, it is, isn’t it?” Trixie grinned. “Trixie cooled them down before putting them in her pocket, and put them in stasis. Cold beer on tap!”</p><p class="double">“…no, I meant the concept.”</p><p class="double">Trixie shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Queen Chrysalis smiled, her triumph at hand. Celestia was defeated, the Elements lay before her in various states of abject defeat… it was good to be the queen.</p><p class="double">“Well, so much for the mighty land of Equestria-” she paused, and frowned. “Who is that?”</p><p class="double">Everypony and every… ling, looked.</p><p class="double">There was a griffin standing against one wall, trying without much success to whistle nonchalantly.</p><p class="double">“What are you doing here?”</p><p class="double">“Playing.” With that one word answer, the Griffin picked up a dice and threw it. “All right, six! Perfect!”</p><p class="double">Stepping back, she revealed a large crank on the wall, and turned it.</p><p class="double">With a clunk, something came shooting out of the wall. It looked like…</p><p class="double">A stop sign.</p><p class="double">It hit a bucket on a stick which was hanging from one of the rafters. That in turn fell over, releasing a large metal ball, which went rolling down the steps outside in a long series of rumble-<i>thuds</i>.</p><p class="double">Something went <i>ping.</i></p><p class="double">Part of the palace plumbing collapsed, and a bathtub erupted through the roof in a shower of plaster. Through it fell a marble, which hit the firing catch of a guard’s crossbow, and that sent the bolt bouncing off three walls to cut through a rope.</p><p class="double">Every eye had been following this increasingly bizarre series of events, Chrysalis among them, and it took her a moment too long to realize that the rope was connected to a <i>very</i> large cage.</p><p class="double">“Mousetrap!” Gilda shouted. “Brilliant!”</p><p class="double">“…I feel terribly stupid…” Chrysalis muttered. Celestia made a noise of commiseration.</p><p class="double">Trixie walked into the hall from a side door. “Okay, you win. Want another go?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Gilda looked around. “Might need to find a different castle, though…”</p><p class="double">“There’s a nice one in Trottingham.” With a blue flash, both of them vanished.</p><p class="double">The bedraggled Princess Cadence looked at where the duo had been. “Wait, isn’t that the castle you gave Prince Blueblood?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.3</p><p class="double">Twilight looked back and forth across the group.</p><p class="double">“Right. How on Equestria are we going to sort this one out?”</p><p class="double">“Rotating evilness again?” Rarity suggested. “I know I’d like to see what we’ve all come up with since…”</p><p class="double">“True, true.” Twilight set up an easel, and took out cutie-mark markers. “Okay, there’s a total of…” she looked across the rest of the alicorns, counting under her breath. “I make it twelve, since Nyx and Trixie have joined us since the last time.”</p><p class="double">“Well, thirteen actually…” Dash put in. “Spike’s on the way here, he turned up the other side of the world. He’ll take a few days to get here.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight shrugged. “Who knows. Anyway, who goes evil first?”</p><p class="double">Nyx screwed up her face, her horn glowed, and with a <i>bang</i> she was eight feet tall and clad in spiky armour. <b>“Me please!”</b></p><p class="double">“…that’s very impressive,” Luna said, tilting her head. “How do you do the reverb?”</p><p class="double"><b>“This isn’t really armour,” </b>Nyx said helpfully. <b>“It’s my stereo from my subspace pocket. I just put an illusion on it. The volume knob’s the fourth spiky bit down on the left, and the bass is the one below it.”</b></p><p class="double">“Anyone else want to go first?” Twilight checked. “No? Good, looks like you get the slot then. Just one question, what’s your villain name?”</p><p class="double"><b>“Oh, that’s right, isn’t it, Nightmare Moon’s kind of redundant…”</b> The newly nominated villain trailed off. <b>“What about Dark Side?”</b></p><p class="double">“Could work,” Applejack allowed.</p><p class="double">“Yes, it sounds good,” Rarity added.</p><p class="double">The general murmur of agreement continued for a moment, then died away.</p><p class="double">“Well, that’s settled, then.” Twilight nodded to her. “Okay, here goes.”</p><p class="double">They all dove for cover.</p><p class="double"><b>“Muahahaha!” </b>the newly designated Dark Side laughed. <b>“I will… er… hang on, time out, I forgot to have an evil plan.”</b></p><p class="double">Trixie pulled off a sheet which had been disguising her as a rock. “I’ll help. I need some ideas myself… do you have a position open for a minion?”</p><p class="double">Nyx rubbed a hoof against her chin, pondering. <b>“Do you have experience in evil?”</b></p><p class="double">“I did once take over a town by using an evil amulet to gain dark powers?” Trixie volunteered helpfully.</p><p class="double"><b>“Hmmm…”</b></p><p class="double">“And I’ve got an evil plan for you to do.”</p><p class="double"><b>“Welcome to Team Evil!”</b> Nyx spread her wings welcomingly. <b>“We have dental.”</b></p><p class="double">“Really?” Trixie looked interested.</p><p class="double"><b>“It’s the fangs…”</b> Nyx trotted forward. <b>“What was this evil plan you were suggesting?”</b></p><p class="double">“Well-” Trixie began.</p><p class="double">There was a terrible screeching sound, and every alicorn clapped their hooves over their ears.</p><p class="double"><b>“Oh, oopsie! Sorry, I’m </b>having a bit of feedback…” Nyx shrugged, her spiky armour making popping noises. “I guess I broke it.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded sympathetically. “I once had a bad sound system. It went <i>really</i> wrong.”</p><p class="double">“How wrong?” Nyx asked, shrugging the repurposed stereo off and wrinkling her nose at the smell of frying insulation.</p><p class="double">“It played me really squeaky. I had to play it off as a comedy thing…”</p><p class="double">“Shouldn’t you have an evil plan by now?” Dash heckled.</p><p class="double">Nyx stiffened. “I think I just worked out my evil plan.”</p><p class="double">“What’s that, then, my lady?” Trixie said, turning to stand next to her.</p><p class="double">“Ooh, I like that…” Nyx shook her head. “Anyway, the plan is, smother Equestria in stage effects. The stage mist will last forever!”</p><p class="double">Lightning crashed.</p><p class="double">“You really are <i>very</i> good at that, by the way,” she added. “I can see this is going to work out well.”</p><p class="double">“Ye~es,” Trixie drew out the word, “but it does mean I have to come up with something for myself to do. Cover the sky in fireworks?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t words.</p><p class="double">Ponies wouldn&#039;t normally be able to understand, but... it wasn&#039;t words, exactly. Or images. Those cropped up sometimes, yes, when necessary. At its fundament, though, the Hive was raw self meeting raw self, communication on a basic level. All the changelings connected to it, and many that had been enveloped by it at their deaths, shifted and tumbled and understood each other in a vast ocean that somehow, itself, had gained an ancient, indecipherable intelligence.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed as the hive mind swirled around her. There weren&#039;t words, just... worry. Concern. They wanted to know if she was okay. They wanted to know why she had, very abruptly, cut herself off almost completely and charged right toward the heart of ponykind. They wanted to know what had happened, whether they could help.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d ignored it for two weeks. The concern had gotten stronger.</p><p class="double">Finally, she had politely excused herself back to the swarm&#039;s abode--Twilight had mentioned she spent a loop as the Changeling Queen so she understood the pressures of the Hive--and simply sat in her chambers. Then she let her memories flow.</p><p class="double">There was... some confusion. Some. But it faded quickly.</p><p class="double">There weren&#039;t words, but if there were the hive would be saying that she should have told them sooner so that they could comfort her.</p><p class="double">The drones approached gently, nuzzling at her as she once more sobbed...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there Chrysalis, Fluttershy wanted to know if... you...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared.</p><p class="double">In the centre of the room was Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings..... and Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">And Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">Aaaaaand Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">And, oh look, Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">And, yet again, Shining Armor</p><p class="double">And, of course, Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">.....and Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">Shining Armor was there as well.</p><p class="double">Twilight recognized her brother amongst the crowd.</p><p class="double">The captain of the guard looked back at her.</p><p class="double">A white unicorn with a blue mane had frozen at her entrance.</p><p class="double">Cadance&#039;s beau coughed, awkwardly.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis held up a hoof. &quot;I swear, this wasn&#039;t my idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, slowly.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Look, the hive mind was worried and I let them know what was going on and one thing led to another--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not like we did anything serious!&quot; the changeling queen reassured her. &quot;We just cuddled!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis would have been sweating bullets if changelings had sweat glands. &quot;Come on, after what I&#039;ve been through I think I deserve a coping mechanism that doesn&#039;t involve alcohol!&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shrugged. &quot;You may have a point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, okay? I just... I was weak, and I&#039;m sorry, and--&quot;</p><p class="double">A purple hoof cut her off. Twilight was giving her a sympathetic look. &quot;Hey. I know how it feels to lose somepony you love to the loops. I&#039;ve been awake for, oh, who knows how long now. I get it, you messed up, and... well, I&#039;m a little bit annoyed that this happened and I&#039;m going to keep it for blackmail but really, it&#039;s not nearly as bad as it could have been.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis drooped. &quot;I don&#039;t know how you can possibly forgive me for this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You need to have a chat with Nyx the next time you&#039;re both Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn giggled. &quot;Nope, not spoiling the surprise. Seriously though... Trust me. You&#039;re in the clear for now, okay? We can keep this our little secret for now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis took a moment to compose herself. &quot;I... thank you, Twilight Sparkle. I hope to prove your trust is not misplaced.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sure that you&#039;ll succeed. By the way, you ever do this again and I will let Pinkie <i>have her way with you.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen gulped. &quot;Understood.&quot; The sheer storm of emotions coming from that particular pony had nearly convinced her the world was ending.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.5</p><p class="double">“Okay, that looks good…” Fluttershy whispered, looking the latest attempt over closely. “Can you swivel them?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis crossed her eyes, and the small cat ears which were replacing her normal ones obediently moved first left, then right.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Fluttershy nodded. “Looks like you got the muscles down properly. Now, er… I had an idea for a prank…”</p><p class="double">The Changeling Queen looked at Fluttershy. “Let’s hear it, then.”</p><p class="double">“Well, er…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Be on watch,” Luna reminded her sister. “We have heard that there is an evil abroad in the land.”</p><p class="double">“I am, Luna,” Celestia assured her. “I am ready for anything. Nothing will interfere with this wedding.”</p><p class="double">Luna swung her telescope groundwards. “Who might that be?”</p><p class="double">Celestia stepped up to the railing. “I… don’t know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Ohayo!” came a bright, cheerful voice.</p><p class="double">Cadence looked over. “Who are you?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, gomennasai.” The pony she was addressing looked terribly downcast, and her ears flattened against her head.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait, they did what?</i> Cadence looked closer.</p><p class="double">The pegasus in question had ears that were distinctly… feline.</p><p class="double">“Oh!” As Cadence looked, the ears perked up again. “Oh, ah… can I have your autograph, Cadence-chan?”</p><p class="double">The princess of love blanked. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">That didn’t seem to dissuade the strange pegasus, who thrust a notebook and quill into her hooves. “Please?”</p><p class="double">Numbly, Cadence scribbled down her signature and offered it back to the black-coated pegasus, whose face lit up.</p><p class="double">“Ariagato!” The… cat-pony shot off, practically bouncing along the corridor.</p><p class="double">Cadence turned to Twilight, who was stuffing a hoof into her mouth to avoid laughing. “What just happened, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Slowly and carefully, Twilight took a deep breath. When she was sure of being able to speak without giggling, she began.</p><p class="double">“I think that was probably a Neighponese fangirl,” Twilight explained. “You can tell by the cat ears.”</p><p class="double">From down the corridor came the sound of a fairly successful glomp, and some shouting from Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">“I’ll go sort that out,” Twilight excused herself.</p><p class="double">She supposed that, on balance, it was probably a good sign if Chrysalis was able to do this kind of thing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.6 (Anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle had a list.</p><p class="double">Actually, she had <i>lots</i> of lists, but somewhere between The Official Summer Sun Celebration Overseer&#039;s Checklist (version three, from a loop where Celestia had complicated the usual scenario with a truly inordinate fondness for carrots, heavy metal music, thunderstorms, and clashing color combinations) and The Official List of Things Looping Pinkie Pie Is Not Allowed To Do Volume XXIV, was a list of experiments to run, experiences to seek out, and pranks to play when the loops allowed. Twilight being Twilight, this list was neatly sorted and cross-indexed by the prerequisite fellow Loopers and loop conditions.</p><p class="double">So, when Twilight found herself in a baseline loop with a start point prior to the Sonic Rainboom with Rainbow Dash Awake, she was quickly able to remind herself of what she wanted to try.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle wanted to earn a cutie mark. Specifically, she wanted a different cutie mark. She&#039;d attempted this before, but time and time again had only received her own starbust mark. (She had looped into alternate selves with different marks a few times, but that didn&#039;t count.)This time, though, Twilight had a special <i>sub</i>list of steps to prevent many of the pitfalls she had encountered in past experiments.</p><p class="double">Step One, asking Rainbow Dash to not do a sonic rainboom, was necessary because Twilight had found that, if her many-colored friend performed one close to the appropriate time, no matter what precautions Twilight took, it would trigger a magical surge and her normal cutie mark. This required only a promise to arrange a <i>sextuple </i>sonic rainboom the next time everypony was Awake in a baseline loop early enough in the timeline.</p><p class="double">Step Two was to prevent her parents from applying her for entry to the School For Gifted Unicorns. This loop was early enough, thankfully, that all it would take would be to “lose interest” in the obsessive magical studies her pre-loop self had just begun, and find something non-magical to occupy herself with over the summer. Probably pranking Cadance and Shining Armor, if they weren&#039;t Looping. Seeing them with adult eyes, it was always hilarious how desperate they were to hide their budding relationship from both Twilight and her parents.</p><p class="double">Step Three, enjoy a life as an ordinary unicorn filly (or at least as “ordinary” as one being foalsat by an alicorn princess could be), avoid magic as much as possible, start school in the fall, and see what happened.</p><p class="double">It was a simple plan. Nothing could possibly go wrong.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Upper East Canterlot Elementary was not much like the School For Gifted Unicorns or even that most terrible of tortures, Magic Kindergarten. For one, there were earth ponies and pegasi attending, though they were a minority of the herd of students. For another, Twilight Sparkle was neither the famous personal student of the Princess, nor a bullied outcast who couldn&#039;t control her weak magic.</p><p class="double">It was actually rather refreshing to just be a background face in the crowd, and for the first few months of class Twilight just drifted while pondering what kind of cutie mark to seek out, carefully doing just well enough in classes to be counted as a good student, but not enough to make a name for herself as exceptional. She made many acquaintances but no friends, but also no enemies. There was still a sizable enough mass of students in her year without cutie marks that her own blank flank normally attracted no comments.</p><p class="double">Today was one of the exceptions, but not due to the (sadly for the most part inevitable) bullying that late blank flanks endured. During P.E., Twilight had – quite accidentally – managed to score the winning goal in a game of hoofball, from over halfway across the field. Her own team, half the opposing side, and even the coach, had immediately clustered around her, and the groans of disappointment as they&#039;d found her lavender fur unmarked had been audible.</p><p class="double">While it <i>would</i> have technically met her goals, Twilight Sparkle could not be disappointed that she&#039;d failed to reveal a special destiny of being good at kicking balls into nets. She was certain there were ponies that would find that a happy and fulfilling hobby, but it wasn&#039;t really <i>her</i>. Which was probably why she was still a blank flank, actually. Twilight had been so focused on avoiding anything that even hinted of magic that she&#039;d deliberately avoided doing pretty much anything she loved. She wasn&#039;t going to get a cutie mark that way.</p><p class="double">As she headed home (P.E being the final class of the day for her class section), Twilight was lost in thought. Maybe she should start showing her enjoyment of reading and aim for a librarian cutie mark, she wondered as she turned a corner, or would it be better to try new things and find something she didn&#039;t know she enjoyed yet? Then she stopped dead. Somepony was <i>following</i> her! Why would anypony do that?</p><p class="double">“Come out, whoever you are!” Twilight yelled, glancing up at the trees that lined the narrow cross-street she usually took on her way home.</p><p class="double">Not completely surprisingly, it was one of her classmates who came down to street level in clumsy, hesitant flight.</p><p class="double">“Um... hi?” the orange pegasus colt said awkwardly as he landed in front of Twilight, his wings closing on his sides.</p><p class="double">Twilight glared at him for just a moment. “Flash Sentry, right?” she asked. That had actually been a surprise, that the stallion who frequently became the captain of her guard when she became a Princess had grown up in the same neighborhood as her.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” he said nervously, shifting away a little, like he was about to bolt. Whatever he might become in the future, right now he was still a little blank flank colt that she&#039;d caught stalking her.</p><p class="double">Twilight decided to just raise an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry shifted again before answering the unspoken question. “You ran off so fast after P.E., Twilight. I just... I wanted to let you know I think you&#039;re really -” He stopped suddenly, turned bright red, and started stammering. “I... I... mean I... I wanted to say I thought that <i>kick</i> was really awesome, that&#039;s all!”</p><p class="double">Twilight was only able to hold her stern expression for a moment before she started to giggle. Okay, the stalking was a bit creepy, maybe, but it was almost certainly innocent, and more importantly adorable. Maybe a little harmless schoolyard romance was just the thing to make her push her limits and find something unmagical to...</p><p class="double">That was when somepony rammed into her from behind. Twilight let out a surprised yelp as she stumbled forward into Flash Sentry, sending both of them tumbling over.</p><p class="double">“Excuse me,” the filly behind them said, choking back a sob and pushing past the two young ponies, her eyes fixed on the ground.</p><p class="double">“Hey, wait!” Flash Sentry called out as he stood, disentangling himself from Twilight.</p><p class="double">Twilight rose as well, studying the pink-maned white unicorn, tall for her age, who had stopped dead a yard or so away. It took only a moment to place her as a student in the same year but another class. “Your name is Fleur, right?” she asked. Another pony she remembered from other loops, though only vaguely. She became friends with Rarity sometimes, didn&#039;t she?</p><p class="double">Fleur just nodded, not even turning to face Twilight and Flash.</p><p class="double">“Are you okay?” the pegasus asked worriedly. “It sounded like you were cry-”</p><p class="double">“Shut <i>up!</i>” Fleur interrupted. “What do you care? Leave me alone and go back to flirting with the hoofball star!”</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry took a step back, his wings flapping wildly. “It... it isn&#039;t like that! Twilight, I swear -”</p><p class="double">Twilight ignored him for the moment, walking past him and up to Fleur. “Blue Belle, right?” she asked. Schoolyard politics were not terribly hard for her to sort out, though they actually were more mature than the adult version sometimes.</p><p class="double">For the first time, Fleur turned her head back to look at Twilight. “Yes, all right?” she snapped, while she talked revealing silver braces on her teeth. “She called me an ugly, clumsy blank flank who can&#039;t trot five steps without tripping over her own four hooves, and I want to go off and cry about it like the crybaby I am, so just <i>go away</i>.”</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry looked angry, and Twilight decided to say something to derail the train of thought the was almost certainly going through his mind before he said or did something stupid. “We&#039;re all blank flanks,” Twilight said quietly, slowly stepping closer to the other filly, “and...” she trailed off, then with an exaggerated glance back at Flash pressed against Fleur and whispered in her ear, “if my brother&#039;s magazines are any sign, in a few years the colts will find long legs <i>very </i>attractive.”</p><p class="double">Fleur blushed, the scarlet flush easily visible through pale fur. “Shut up,” she said, though far less harshly, though she still stepped away. “That&#039;s gross.”</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry looked confused. “What did you say, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled, and after a moment Fleur joined her. Twilight offered a hoof. “I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle,” she introduced herself.</p><p class="double">Fleur gingerly touched hooves, giving a weak shake. “Fleur Dis Lee,” she said.</p><p class="double">Not to be left out, the lone colt offered, “Flash Sentry.”</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced at her two companions, a thought occurring. Well, for the parallel to be exact she&#039;d have to turn Flash into a filly and Fleur into an earth pony, but those were minor details. A wicked grin appeared on her face. “I have an idea...”</p><p class="double">Fleur looked nervous. “What?”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re all blank flanks, aren&#039;t we?” Twilight asked, and started to explain. As she did, Fleur&#039;s eyes widened and Flash started to grin. “...and we could form our own secret society!” Twilight finished excitedly.</p><p class="double">“It needs a name, though,” Fleur observed, her distress apparently forgotten in the wake of Twilight&#039;s proposal.</p><p class="double">“Triple Cutie Threat!” Flash Sentry proposed.</p><p class="double">The two fillies shared a look and a giggle, then Twilight smiled. Trademarks didn&#039;t persist between loops, so she might as well go all the way. “The Cutie Mark Crusaders.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When the three young ponies knocked on the door of Twilight&#039;s home a couple hours later, Twilight&#039;s mom gave them one look, then sent them around back to rinse off with the garden hose before coming inside.</p><p class="double">“That kind of tree isn&#039;t even supposed to <i>have</i> this much sap,” Twilight said sourly as she pretended to struggle with her magic to loosen the stuck valve and turn the water on.</p><p class="double">“And we&#039;re banned from <i>every</i> bowling alley in Canterlot!” Fleur wailed. “It&#039;s terrible.”</p><p class="double">“Let me get it,” Flash said, reaching for the valve. Twilight let him have it. “It was a lot of fun, though,” he said, grunting as the stubborn metal refused to budge.</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Fleur said softly. “It was. I... I really liked it. Thank you.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “What are friends for?” she offered.</p><p class="double">“Are we friends?” Fleur asked.</p><p class="double">Flash glanced at her. “Of course we are,” he said, sounding confused that it was even a question. Twilight just grinned and nodded.</p><p class="double">Fleur was still a moment, then suddenly engulfed the other two in a hug.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Flash protested, struggling a little to get free.</p><p class="double">Twilight just returned the hug, smiling. Even if the experiment failed – again – this loop would be worth it just for the chance to make new friends.</p><p class="double">There was a familiar tingling on her side, and Fleur gasped suddenly.</p><p class="double">“Wow, Twilight,” Flash said. “You&#039;re really good at this whole earning cutie marks thing!”</p><p class="double">Twilight started to wrestle herself free. “What is it?” she demanded, and when she finally could she twisted her head around to see for herself.</p><p class="double">A familiar starbust stared back at her, and Twilight froze. How? She hadn&#039;t been doing anything even remotely magical... <i>oh</i>. “Ponyfeathers,” she swore, drawing a scandalized gasp from Fleur and a puzzled look from Flash.</p><p class="double">Ignoring the two for a moment, Twilight planted her hoof in her face. It was something she, of all ponies, should never have forgotten to take into account.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s wrong with it, Twilight?” Flash asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned before answering, not that he was likely to understand. “Friendship <i>is </i>magic.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.7</p><p class="double">“Right.” Applejack looked across the kitchen counter. “Ready?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Pinkie chirped.</p><p class="double">They both looked down at the ingredients strewn all over the kitchen. Apples, flour, milk, apples, sugar, apples, a little chocolate, apples, apples, yeast, apples, eggs, butter, cinnamon and apples.</p><p class="double">“We’re gonna get this whole buffalo business sorted out once and for all,” Applejack said grimly. “Now… go!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie grabbed a whisk and poured the flour, some of the sugar, the eggs and some butter into the bowl. “Working on the pastry, cap’n!”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha,” Applejack replied, picking up a knife and getting to work on the apples, the apples and the apples. “Pass me that cinnamon, would’ya?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Pinkie spun her head as she worked, which flipped the cinnamon into the air. It bounced off the ceiling, the lid came off, and just enough cinnamon to flavour the apples spilled onto them before it hit the workbench and the lid landed right back on top of it again.</p><p class="double">Applejack blinked. “Okay, how’d y’all do that?” she mumbled around the knife handle.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged, still enthusiastically mixing.</p><p class="double">“Eh, whatever.” After a suspicious look, Applejack got back to the apples.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Slowly and reverently, Pinkie withdrew the baking tray from the oven.</p><p class="double">Resting on it were six Apple-Pie Apple Pies.</p><p class="double">With a series of <i>thuds</i>, two of the Crusaders and Winona crashed into the side of the house.</p><p class="double">“Guess you like the smell, do ya?” Applejack said, leaning out the window. “Hey, where’s Scootaloo?”</p><p class="double">“Dunno,” Sweetie replied, standing still and sniffing at the delicious aromas coming out of the window.</p><p class="double">Then there was the sound of a crash on the roof.</p><p class="double">“I’m okay!” Scootaloo shouted. “But my hang glider isn’t… wow, that smells <i>good</i>.”</p><p class="double">“They ain’t for you,” Applejack said sternly. “Maybe the next batch, but not this one. These are gonna head off a war.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So.” The buffalo chief stared across a table at his opposite number. “You wish to bargain with us?”</p><p class="double">“We do,” Silver Star answered. “We would prefer peace to war.”</p><p class="double">“You think you are the only ones?” Thunderhooves shrugged. “But no matter. Posturing will not bring peace.”</p><p class="double">Applejack sidled up to the table. “Ah think it might calm tempers if y’all had some food while you’re negotiatin’.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good,” Silver Star said. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Apple Pie.” Applejack trotted over to a cart and took two covered dishes from it. Putting them in front of the dignitaries, she swept the covers off in one motion.</p><p class="double">Then she noticed Pinkie had got out a banjo, and tackled her before she ruined everything.</p><p class="double">“This… smells good,” Thunderhooves said slowly, looking down at the Apple Pie.</p><p class="double">Then, as though on an invisible signal, both he and Silver Star dove into their Pies.</p><p class="double">Thirty seconds later, they were done.</p><p class="double">“That was <i>very</i> good,” the sheriff said, licking his lips. “Er… are there any more?”</p><p class="double">Applejack and Pinkie exchanged glances. Then looked around at the large, curious herds of buffalo and ponies.</p><p class="double">“We may have made a teensy amount too few…” Pinkie suggested. “I suggest we run.”</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded solemnly. Then both of them broke into a gallop, headed for the train line.</p><p class="double">“Well, on the bright side, at least they’re not fighting any more!” Pinkie said chirpily.</p><p class="double">“Yay,” Applejack deadpanned. “Next time, we make as many of ‘em as we can fit in a train!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.8</p><p class="double">“I can’t believe this,” Rarity said, shaking her head.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Spike replied, blinking. “<i>This</i> is becoming a big deal?”</p><p class="double">“Of course it is!” Rarity frowned. “This is a very important… issue…”</p><p class="double">She trailed off.</p><p class="double">“On balance, the fact that you keep eating the spoons isn’t all that major,” she allowed. “But I don’t like your blithe dismissal of my concerns.”</p><p class="double">“So… I’m right, but you don’t like how I was right?” Spike checked.</p><p class="double">“Not quite. You should give my opinions the weight they deserve.”</p><p class="double">“Again, what I was saying, but casting me in a more negative light. That’s got <i>me</i> annoyed now.” Spike tapped a claw on the floor. “Okay, look. We’re just going to keep finding excuses to snarl at one another if we don’t work this off. I suggest the Frozen North. Two hours, full battle rattle, first one unconscious has to wash up.”</p><p class="double">Rarity looked over at her sink, despite herself. “There’s nothing <i>to</i> wash up.”</p><p class="double">“Which is why I’m going to let Pinkie Pie make a making up cake in here,” Spike replied with an evil grin.</p><p class="double">“You wouldn’t!” Rarity gasped.</p><p class="double">Spike waved a paw. “On reflection… I think I would, actually.”</p><p class="double">“Spike, if you <i>dare-”</i></p><p class="double">“Well, you’d better beat me, then, hadn’t you?” he challenged. “I mean, if you do, then the net result is cake.”</p><p class="double">Rarity scowled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why am I involved in this?” Twilight asked, seemingly to herself.</p><p class="double">“In case we are both knocked out and need to be transported back to Ponyville,” Spike replied, now about fifty feet long.</p><p class="double">“And so that you can bear witness that I’ve won,” Rarity added. She had her wings out, and was wearing something made out of woven diamond and magic, which still bore the faint proof-scarring from when she’d tested it.</p><p class="double">By jumping between Chrysalis and Celestia’s beam war at the Canterlot Wedding.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight rolled her eyes. “Seriously, can’t you two have <i>normal</i> couples’ spats?”</p><p class="double">“No,” the other two replied in unison.</p><p class="double">“Right. Okay, the rules are, nothing fatal. Though given what you two are like, I didn’t need to tell you anyway… go!”</p><p class="double">Twilight slammed up a bunker shield, and watched the fireworks.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oooh…” the population of Manehattan breathed, watching some particularly energetic northern lights.</p><p class="double">“Aaaahhh…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna opened the door to her bedroom, ready for a well-earned day’s rest.</p><p class="double">Then she paused.</p><p class="double">“Sister? Didst thou install a dragon in mine room when I was not looking?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight…” Celestia said, her voice slightly strained, “Why is Spike asleep in my sister’s bedroom? For that matter, why is he fifty feet long and covered in scorch marks?”</p><p class="double">Behind them, Luna poked at the slumbering dragon with the butt of a guard’s spear. Occasionally, she muttered something under her breath.</p><p class="double">“It’s a long story,” Twilight said weakly. “Luna’s bedroom was the best place I could find for them to sleep it off.”</p><p class="double">“Them?”</p><p class="double">“Aha!” Luna said, with an air of triumph in her voice. “I have found another interloper!” Then her tone changed. “I was aware of Cadence, but her cutie mark is not much like the one you vouchsafed to me. That is a diamond repeated three times, not the Crystal Heart…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Okay, I’ll start from the beginning. Can you send for cocoa? This could take a while.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Barely-within-rating omake (Stainless Steel Fox):</p><p class="double"><u>Omake</u></p><p class="double">Rarity stirred, and snuggled against Spike&#039;s neck. &quot;Ohhh Spike! You&#039;re so strong and tough. I love the way your scales shine like diamonds when you swoop...&quot;</p><p class="double">The big dragon rumbled happily, shrinking down a couple of age categories until he was Big Mac sized. &quot;I have the most beautiful and most amazing filly in the world as a girlfriend. Have I told you how incredibly sexy you are when you&#039;re angry?</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Spike!&quot; &quot;Oh Rarity!&quot; &quot;Oh brother!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pair suddenly realised they weren&#039;t alone and stopped what looked to be the start of an epic makeout session.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot; Rarity looked up, and noticed the purple unicorn standing there, and behind her, Princess Luna and Celestia. &quot;Eep!&quot;</p><p class="double">She hauled up the bedsheets around herself, noticing for the first time that they had Luna&#039;s cutie-mark. &quot;This isn&#039;t what it looks like!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually it sort of is...&quot; admitted Spike.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.9 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Pinkness</b></p><p class="double">Applejack took a deep breath and ran a hand through his short-cut hair. There were at least two things wrong with that sentence in his opinion, but the universe seemed to care even less than usual. &quot;Alright, let&#039;s review. Twilight, yer… what exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">The rather short girl adjusted her glasses. &quot;A humanoid interface for the Integrated Data Thought Entity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s local memories offered a literary reference she didn&#039;t recognize. That seemed to be a habit this Loop. &quot;Right, an&#039; that is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Basically, imagine the end result of a Loop if Apple Bloom were the Anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">After pondering this for a moment, Applejack asked, &quot;So mah baby sister&#039;s gonna invent magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. &quot;Well, it&#039;s not magic so much as manipulating the metadata of existence through—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, magic.&quot; Applejack turned to the other boy in the group. &quot;Rarity, yer—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Elusive in this context, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">It just wasn&#039;t fair, Applejack thought. Even when they were both stallions, Rarity was still prettier. &quot;Right. <i>Elusive</i>, yer still sort of a unicorn?&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a nod. &quot;Yes, but my magic only works in certain locations. &#039;Closed spaces,&#039; as they&#039;re called.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; we ain&#039;t in one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Elusive&#039;s mild grin shifted to utmost seriousness. &quot;Believe me, Applejack, if we were in a closed space, you&#039;d know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, right. Good to know.&quot; Applejack shifted focus to Fluttershy. He wasn&#039;t afraid. It just seemed prudent. If there was an element of haste, it was simply to get this review over with all the faster. &quot;Now, Shy, yer a time traveller?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. &quot;From classified information years in the… oh.&quot; She blushed. &quot;Sorry. This is a very powerful mental block. I&#039;d have to Ascend to bypass it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The idea was tempting, but Applejack shook his head. &quot;Let&#039;s save that &#039;til we really need it.&quot; He moved to the last person in the room. &quot;Rainbow, yer a mob boss&#039;s daughter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apparently.&quot; Dash grinned, revealing rather prominent canines. &quot;Whoever I am doesn&#039;t normally hang out with you guys, but that&#039;s not gonna stop me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t have it any other way, sugarcube.&quot; Applejack frowned. &quot;And meanwhile, here Ah am, not so much as a scrap of magic t&#039; mah name.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a puzzled frown. &quot;What are you talking about? You can still earthbend, access your dimensional pocket, Ascend—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Far as mah memories go, Ah mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; The interface had the decency to blush. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And then there&#039;s Pinkie Pie,&quot; noted Elusive.</p><p class="double">The door to the club room slammed open. Speak of the Nightmare, thought Applejack, and she will appear.</p><p class="double">Hand on her hips and smile on her face, Paizumiya Pinkuhi stood proudly in the doorway. &quot;Hello, SOS-Dan! Are you ready to find the impossible?&quot;</p><p class="double">The five humans stared at their friend, knowing that the question was entirely rhetorical. No matter what they said, she&#039;d browbeat them into helping her saving the world by overloading it with fun. Even if she couldn&#039;t do it directly, subconscious reality distortion would make it so.</p><p class="double">Twilight broadcast a message to the other Awakened members of the brigade through something distinct from telepathy in ways only she cared about. <i>I can honestly say I have never been more terrified in my entire existence.</i> The others could only nod.</p><p class="double">Pinkuhi took this as assent. &quot;Great! Hope you&#039;re all ready, &#039;cause I&#039;ve got a big, big itinerary planned. Kyon, you&#039;re paying.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed. Ascension was looking more and more appealing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.10 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity eyed the pink-coated pony that Rainbow Dash had awoken as in this loop, took a deep breath and asked, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why what?&quot; Rainbow Dash, still a pegasus but now in the body of Firefly, asked innocently as she hovered in the air.</p><p class="double">Rarity, now Sparkler, just stared accusingly.</p><p class="double">Firefly sighed and broke, &quot;Fine, I made a mistake. Ancient proto-Equestrian alternate history was never my strong suit in school. What was I supposed to think? Besides, even without going all ascendant alicorn on his flank, we&#039;re all more than a match for that Tirak by ourselves. Look at me! I was awesome before, but now I&#039;m so fast I can rip holes into other dimensions. You have even more affinity for jewels and stuff than you used to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s galled gemomancy; and yes, as Sparkler, I find that I can control them to a much higher degree,&quot; Sparkler said as she casually ripped out a sizable emerald shard out of the earth and sent it streaking into and through a nearby oak tree. &quot;That still doesn&#039;t excuse what you did.&quot;</p><p class="double">Firefly swallowed heavily, &quot;Come on! Look at what Pinkie Pie has become. She&#039;s up there flapping around as Surprise and shouting something about legendary super saiyans. Applejack may look the same, but she seems even stronger than she was before.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack tried to walk over to Firefly, but instead stumbled into a nearby sizable tree - knocking it down. </p><p class="double">&quot;Why the hay am I so clumsy in this form?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie in the form of Surprise was suddenly there, giggling and pointing towards the orange pony, &quot;Because you are a silly pony, Applejack. A very silly pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack snorted in annoyance, &quot;That&#039;s not even a real answer.&quot;</p><p class="double">Firefly/Dash continued, &quot;Posey is an earth pony, so she&#039;s even more in tune with all those forest critters than Fluttershy was, no matter how impossible that seems. And Twilight. Twilight&#039;s special talent is now being a bucking reality warper only a few levels below Discord. Once she pulls herself together, she&#039;ll have infinite wishes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sparkler looked over at the unicorn, who was lying on her side in a miserable ball, &quot;What is wrong with her?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight wailed in answer, &quot;I look just like my mother!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Technically if this world does evolve into the Equestria we know, you are probably your own great, great, great, great, etcetera grandmother!&quot; Surprise stated happily as she flew off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, right,&quot; Firefly said, &quot;So extra dimensional saviour or not, it doesn&#039;t matter. Besides, what would a pony like Firefly think? She punches a hole into another dimension looking for a saviour. The world is in peril. Time is critical. Who was she going to choose? A strange monkey-ape thing that she&#039;s never seen before, or this strong stallion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He is just a common human-world horse. He&#039;s not even sentient!&quot; Sparkler pointed to the brown equine. Said &#039;hero&#039; was currently grazing happily. &quot;How did you even carry him here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It wasn&#039;t easy. Whatever. Look, I&#039;m going to go punch a hole into an unpleasant dimension and toss that stupid looking centaurian abomination into it. I mean really? Darkness that lasts forever? Been there, done that, kicked it&#039;s flank. Come join the party if you want.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, oh! Me! I want to join the party!&quot; Surprise shouted as she flew after Firefly, followed by a smiling Posey/Fluttershy as she rode on the back of an armoured bear who was at the head of an entire waddling contingent of honey badger cavalry. </p><p class="double">Applejack gathered up Twilight and together they stumbled towards what would probably be the very brief and very final confrontation with Tirak.</p><p class="double">Sparkler watched them leave, briefly contemplating how her pale blue coat made her even more of a winter. As she started off after her friends, she gave one last look at the oblivious human world stallion, &quot;Ugh. You better not be the reason for how the Saddle Arabians developed.&quot;</p><p class="double">TJ, the brown horse idly flicked his ear at the odd pony before continuing to ignore everything that wasn&#039;t grass or a threat.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile on her family farm in the human dimension, Megan stood around in a daze. Earlier, a wondrous rainbow-looking rift opened up and a magical talking pegasus pony flew in, said she needed someone to help save her world from a monster; and before Megan could volunteer in what would surely be as grand and exciting an adventure as any teenage girl could dream of, the pegasus grabbed TJ, her horse, and flew off. </p><p class="double">&quot;Sis, what are you doing here? You&#039;ve been out here for hours. Where&#039;s TJ?&quot; Her sister, Molly, asked as she came near.</p><p class="double">Megan slowly turned her head towards her sister, &quot;I don&#039;t want to talk about it. Not ever.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.11</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The pegasus looked around. “Okay, where the hell am I now? Donald, was this your doing?”</p><p class="double">A unicorn trotted unsteadily over. “Wasn’t me,” he said, with a slight rasp to his voice. “I thought it was your clothes.”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” The pegasus shrugged. “How are you doing with walking?”</p><p class="double">“It ain’t easy.” Donald tripped and nearly faceplanted. “At least you’ve got wings, Sora. And experience at being four legged!”</p><p class="double">“Hey, that’s a point.” Sora spread them, and flailed at the air until he was aloft. “I’ll go look for Goofy.”</p><p class="double">“Sure, whatever…” Donald sat back, trying to work out how his magic had changed. And, for that matter, how to hold his staff.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Huh, new Loopers,” Twilight said, as Dash finished describing them. “Well, I don’t recognize them from the description. One of each type?”</p><p class="double">“Yep, same as usual.” Dash nodded. “Strange thing is, only the pegasus is finding, well, walking easy. And even he moves more like Gilda.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Twilight nodded. “Huh. Interesting. Well, I’d better go and meet them. Go let Princess Luna know, I think she’s Awake.”</p><p class="double">“Aye aye, Twi!” Dash saluted, and vanished in a <i>crack</i> of displaced air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, right…” Sora said, looking up. “So this is where <i>you</i> came from.”</p><p class="double">“It is indeed,” Luna replied. “You would be Sora, yes?”</p><p class="double">“That’s right.” The pegasus crossed his eyes, and a keyblade flashed into being between his teeth. “<i>There</i> we go, I’ve been trying to get that to work all morning…” he added in a mumble.</p><p class="double">“You know him?” Twilight asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“I Replaced one of the people from his Loop once,” Luna explained. “That was the same Loop wherein little Nyx did my job.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, yes, the sideways moon incident,” Twilight said, nodding. “Yes, you did tell me about that place. Keys, wasn’t it?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much.” Sora concentrated, and the keyblade flashed between a dozen different forms. “I’ve got a <i>lot</i> of choice by now. Anyway, what’s your world like?”</p><p class="double">“Mostly peaceful, actually…” Twilight said, shrugging. “We can handle most of the villains who show up just fine. Though, actually…” she trailed off, a grin spreading across her face.</p><p class="double">“What?” Luna asked, seeing it.</p><p class="double">“I was wondering how Sombra would react to being hit by a Keyblade.” Twilight shrugged. “Should be interesting.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.12 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vice principal Luna had called Twilight in and showed her the pictures of her wrecking the Fall Formal. However, this time she wasn&#039;t going to stand there and let the Vice principal steamroller right over her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Vice Principal Luna. I can state absolutely that these things never happened, and that these photos are as fake as something very fake. I can account for my movements the whole day, and most of the time I was even in the company of Pinkie Pie, the planner in charge of the Fall Formal. If I had wrecked it, she&#039;d be the last po-person to give me an alibi. I assume the motivation you felt applied was that I tried to delay it to buy more time to win my bid to be Princess of the Fall Formal from Sunset Shimmer? If so then you are out of date. My friends and I have already done an end run around her and her friends Snips and Snails. If you took the votes right now, it would be Sunset Shimmer who would lose. You can check all this for yourself.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Vice-principal looked at her sternly, but the teenager just stood there calmly, not defensive, just without a doubt.</p><p class="double">&quot;So how do <i>you</i> account for these photos?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took on a thoughtful attitude. &quot;Well, there are three parts to it, method, means and motivation. Method and means are intertwined. The background is real, and so are the images of me, but the whole is not, so somehow, someone got photos of me doing something energetic, like the game of football I had with Rainbow Dash, and added my image over the real culprit. I can think of several ways, either using the school computer and image editing software, or just cutting out a physical photo and running the altered image through a colour photocopier. So I&#039;d ask my friends if they saw anyone taking photos of my game with Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;As to motivation... Who would benefit most from destroying my credibility as a Fall Formal Princess entrant, and delaying the event to give themselves time to regain control of the vote? Someone who&#039;s already used sneaky tactics and disinformation to character assassinate me? If it was the same person who brought you those photos, I&#039;d definitely find them suspect. Out of interest, who is my accuser?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunset Shinmmer.&quot; Principal Luna&#039;s experession hardened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe you should ask her how she got those photos, and why the person taking them didn&#039;t try to stop me instead of just collecting evidence.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the door. Flash Sentry came in and gave her the doctored photos.</p><p class="double">&quot;Vice Principal Luna. I found these in a trash can in the library. Thought you should see them. Someone obviously combined these photos to make it <i>look</i> like Twilight was the one who trashed the gym.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see. Well that is a point for your theory. Of course it also seems convenient that that evidence came to light...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;A double bluff? Setting this up myself to make Sunset Shimmer look like the culprit? I did spend some time in the library, but my alibi still stands, and as I said, my friends did an amazing job of getting people on my side. I don&#039;t need complicated ploys or to take her out of the running. Simple honesty and bringing people together is a far better strategy than trying to cheat and con my way in. Like I said, take the vote right now, you&#039;ll see the truth. I suspect if you check the movements of Snips and Snails, Sunset Shimmer doesn&#039;t seem to be the sort to do her own dirty work, you will also see what&#039;s going on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vice-principal Luna nodded. &quot;Very well. I am afraid enough damage has been done to the gym that we will have to postpone the dance until tomorrow night. If you will excuse me, I need to let my sister know about this latest development. And to ask some questions of Sunset Shimmer.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;I will talk to Pinkie and see if we can get things together sooner than that. After all, I ran for Princess on a platform of helping out and coming together as a school, maybe I can get some people to follow up on that and help out.&quot;</p><p class="double">As they left she turned to Flash Sentry. &quot;Thank you! You have no idea how important this is to me&quot;</p><p class="double">He chuckled. &quot;What was I gonna do? Not prove your innocence? Wouldn&#039;t be much of a Canterlot Wondercolt, would I? So, uh, I was wondering. If you aren&#039;t already going with somebody, wanna go to the Fall Formal with me tomorrow night?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight had no intention of hurting his feelings, even accidentally this time round. &quot;It will be tonight, and yes, I would love to be your date.&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to face him, hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. &quot;If you have some free time, anybody you can round up to help fix the decorations would be good.&quot;</p><p class="double">She had to giggle at the complete experssion of brain-lock this resulted in. &quot;I&#039;ll see you later...&quot;</p><p class="double">As she turned around the end of the hall, she heard a &quot;YESS!&quot; and allowed herself another grin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.13</p><p class="double">“G4,” Shining Armor said, playing a card on the table.</p><p class="double">“Snap,” Discord replied, playing his own. “And that brings my score to a multiple of seven.”</p><p class="double">“One hundred and eighteen isn’t a multiple of seven…” Shining said uncertainly.</p><p class="double">Discord pointed to one of the other cards in play. “Bad mathematics. Lets me adjust the result or input of a calculation up or down by one.”</p><p class="double">Cadence flipped back and forth through the rulebook. “So that means…”</p><p class="double">Discord shifted a counter. “I put my own joker in check, and switch allegiances from Prance to the letter Q.”</p><p class="double">Celestia slammed a card down on the table. “Contingency card! I get the yellow marble.”</p><p class="double">“Then you have a beard,” Luna pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Drat, I do. That makes me vulnerable to the Queensburg Defence.” Celestia examined the table. “Baker Street.”</p><p class="double">“East Ham,” Luna replied.</p><p class="double">“Mornington Crescent!” Cadence collected four cards from the others around the table, then played two of them. “I change history so that the horse collar was never invented, and that triggers a cascade which leads to me getting four extra Lands and a brand of cheese.”</p><p class="double">“Drat,” Celestia said absently. “So much for my gambit. Luna, your turn.”</p><p class="double">“I’m cashing in my lands for an army,” Luna said, shuffling them into the deck. “That lets me take two of Discord’s lands and summon the Moon. Four turns until impact!”</p><p class="double">Cadence helpfully moved the moon counter to the number four.</p><p class="double">“Thank you. And now I’m going to purchase a manor at Trottingham, which puts me on a double word score.”</p><p class="double">After looking at the result of that for a moment, Cadence drew a card. “Yes, it’s my special! Crystal Heart, my holdings are immune to damage for the foreseeable future and so I trade across all my other defences for political power and waffles. Then I loot the room, which gives me treasure. Your turn, Shiny.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor stared at his hand, then at the board. “I have no idea what is going on.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>30.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><u>More Turning the Tables (at long last)</u></p><p class="double">“Careful with that cabinet!” Prince Blueblood called out. “It&#039;s Chippendale!”</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t know they went into furniture making after their detective career...” Pinkie Pie mused.</p><p class="double">The size of the party would push the carrying capacity of Blueblood&#039;s yacht to its limit, so all non-essential equipment was being off loaded under the eyes and fussy attitude of the Prince. Inside the Town hall, Shining Armour passed a scroll to one of the pegasus guards and said, “Concorde, take this to Princess Cadence with all speed!”</p><p class="double">“Yes sir!” The pegasus saluted and trotted out, flexing his wings.</p><p class="double">Shining Armour turned to Twilight and asked, “Okay, so why have I just sent a message that may end up creating another evil alicorn?”</p><p class="double">“The notes I included should explain how Cadence could use her love magic to &#039;burn out&#039; the taint of evil that the Alicorn Amulet casts on its wearer. Of course she doesn&#039;t have the theoretical background to understand them herself, unless she took a night school course I didn&#039;t hear about, but Spell Nexus or one of the senior lecturers at the school can help her put it into practice.</p><p class="double">“At the moment it&#039;s only a theory, but even so, the Amulet doesn&#039;t turn you evil instantly. From my research it&#039;s insidious, slowly twisting your perceptions, but that means that it&#039;ll take a long time to affect some-pony as good and decent as Cadence. As long as she only puts it on when she confronts Nightmare Moon, and takes it off as soon as possible, she should be fine.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t like the &#039;should&#039;.” Shining grimaced. “How did you come to be figuring out something like that anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Research!” Twilight grinned triumphantly. “I came across it while I was studying artificing techniques. Obviously, I wondered how you could get the power boost without the mental problems, and thought of Cadence&#039;s power. Admittedly the whole thing is a &#039;Hail Celestia&#039; play, but an alicorn with the amulet&#039;s power boost is about the only other thing I can think of that could stand up to Nightmare Moon. You remember what Von Clawswitz, the griffon general once said?”</p><p class="double">“&#039;Better a dozen unneeded plans than one unmade one.&#039;” Shining quoted. “Let&#039;s just hope it isn&#039;t needed.”</p><p class="double">He hadn&#039;t realised Twilight had retained so much of the studying she&#039;d done while helping him to prepare for his commission exam. But then, his little sister had been surprising him ever since they&#039;d met up again. He knew she was smart, not to mention powerful, but despite the breakdown she&#039;d had, now she was demonstrating a confidence and ability he&#039;d never seen before. These friends of hers must really be something.</p><p class="double">“Okay, we&#039;re ready to go, guys!” Rainbow Dash appeared at the doorway. They emerged from the town hall and out from under the day-light bubble to find the final preparations for their journey had been made.</p><p class="double">The &#039;Blueblood&#039;, named for the owner&#039;s grandfather, was a typical luxury air-racer. A sleek single deck hull, a dozen pony-lengths from bow to stern and a quarter that in the beam, it lacked the size of a full yacht like that of Fancy Pants. However its rakish lines and white and gold trim as well as the twin sets of powerful wing-sails at the stern screamed both style and speed, or would have done if it hadn&#039;t been far too sophisticated to do anything as gauche as scream.</p><p class="double">The envelope above was three times the size of the gondola, and decorated as a gold dragon with its wings raised in mid-flight. It was filled with lift-gas from reserves stored in the keel, and its interior surface had heating spells that could be activated to increase lift. Magic also powered the heating and cooling charms that drove the closed cycle steam engine under the stern. While more expensive than a regular coal fired boiler, it was far lighter and didn&#039;t require a stoker, both important factors on a small air-ship.</p><p class="double">Blueblood was already at the controls, dressed in a natty billed cap and yachting blazer. The rear part of the open deck lacked a true poop deck, but it was raised a few hoofs from the sweep of the main part, with a chest high combing protecting the wheel. The other ponies trooped aboard, several having to go down into the long cabin that took up the balance of the interior that wasn&#039;t occupied by the engines and lift-gas reserves.</p><p class="double">Big Mac was one of them, as the lower down his heavier wood body was the better it would be. Fluttershy had gone with him, her normal timidity around ponies apparently lessened by the fact that he had the appearance of a giant arborean predator who could rip her to pieces with a single claw swipe (Fluttershy had issues). Applejack was also down below with her brother, and a saddlebag full of apples and other supplies.</p><p class="double">Rarity was on deck, and dressed in her own yachting costume. She&#039;d apparently had one made for a long time, and she was going to wear it for all it was worth while she had the chance. Pinkie Pie was bouncing around on deck too, zipping back and forth to examine everything, while Rainbow Dash wasn&#039;t even on deck but above it, ready to fly escort and looking impatiently at the last two ponies to board.</p><p class="double">The gang-plank retracted as they stepped on deck, and Blueblood manipulated levers and hoof pedals. The wing-sails at the back began to flap in a complicated mechanical pattern, and the dirigible started to rise, very slowly, and move forwards at an equally arthritic pace. Rainbow Dash had started to fly off, and zoomed back when it didn&#039;t follow her.</p><p class="double">“C&#039;mon Blueblood, get the hail out! I thought you said that heap was fast!”</p><p class="double">Blueblood stared up at the annoyed pegasus, matching her expression. “It is, and I&#039;ll thank you not to call the Blueblood a &#039;heap&#039;! However, I normally don&#039;t have this many passengers. It&#039;s taking maximum heat to the gas-bag and additional thrust from the wing-sails to get us to rise at all, let alone make headway! And without some air speed, I can&#039;t angle the dragon wings to provide extra lift. We&#039;re too heavy!”</p><p class="double">“I knew I shouldn&#039;t have had that extra slice of cake!” Rarity bemoaned. “Tell me Twilight, has it gone to my flanks?”</p><p class="double">“You look fine to me.” Twilight replied. “But we shouldn&#039;t be that over-loaded... Well, I guess we&#039;ll just have to give it some extra omph!”</p><p class="double">“Oooh! Pinkie exclaimed, “I&#039;ve never had had oomph before! What flavour is it?”</p><p class="double">“Magic flavour!” Twilight grinned, and brought her horn down to touch the decking. A series of lines spread out from the tip, glowing as they etched a pattern into the wood.</p><p class="double">“Careful!” Blueblood cried out. “That deck is made of Zebrican teak!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure we can sand it out.” Twilight replied without taking eyes or horn from the deck where an intricate ritual diagram had been burnt, with a triangle as the central figure. “If you still want to after you see what it does. Shiny, Rarity, could you stand at the other two points of the triangle?”</p><p class="double">“Okay, Twily.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, dear... this won&#039;t hurt will it?”</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped onto the final point of the triangle and her horn started to glow as she looked between the other two unicorns. “Not a bit, it shouldn&#039;t even prove tiring... can you feel my magic?”</p><p class="double">“If you mean that fizzy, tingly sensation under my hooves, then yes!” Rarity looked surprised. “Yes, I can!”</p><p class="double">“Try to match it, you too big brother!” The three unicorn horns started to glow, and the diagram lit up in sympathy, glowing lines that mixed the colours of the three horns. Blueblood saw every dial on his control panel slam over to the maximum peg, and the Blueblood seemed to leap forward under his hooves. Suddenly she was as fleet and nimble as she ever had been or even more so. His air-speed gauge showed she was doing twenty percent over her maximum.</p><p class="double">“Woo hoo! Now that&#039;s more like it!” cheered Dash.</p><p class="double">“Careful! I&#039;m not sure the envelope can take it!” The dragon shell that decorated the gas bag was also a framework that added support, while the wings gave lift, making it more than a simple blimp, but Blueblood knew they weren&#039;t designed for this speed.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay, I&#039;m diverting some of the power into a structural integrity spell.” Twilight called back. “Or rather the rune-set is.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie was already at the bow, standing on her hind legs with her fore-hooves outstretched. “Hey! I&#039;m Princess of the world! Whee! Except for Celestia, and Cadence, and I guess Luna...”</p><p class="double">“Goodness, I hardly feel as if I&#039;m putting any effort in.” Rarity said.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s the triune. The total power is far greater than the sum of its parts... rather like friendship.” Twilight wasn&#039;t exactly lying. However, this was the perfect way to disguise the fact that she was putting in far more power than the other two. She could easily have carried the whole air-ship at even greater speeds if she tapped her full alicorn powers, and she really wanted to get this done.</p><p class="double">They&#039;d made a good start; they&#039;d already gone out over the Everfree and covered an hour&#039;s walk in a few minutes. Twilight could even see that they were not far from the clearing where Zecora lived. A flock of birds rose from the trees below, startled by the passing air-ship... No, not startled, as they swarmed up around it, black raptor looking things with glowing green slit-pupil eyes...</p><p class="double">Dash dived on the cluster coming up on one side and tried to scare them off, but they ignored her, other than trying to catch her with their talons and sharp edged wing tips.</p><p class="double">“Oh you want to do this the hard way? Fine!” Dash weaved and ducked the smaller creatures and lashed at one with a cloud-busting hoof. It connected, and the &#039;bird&#039; poofed into black smoke.</p><p class="double">“Eeek! Black Snooty!” Pinkie squeaked, but quickly recovered and pulled a long handled net from somewhere, sweeping it about to catch the birds.</p><p class="double">“All hooves on deck!” Blueblood called out, reaching up and setting his billed cap at a rakish angle. “Prepare to repel boarders!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy and the Apple family members came storming up, crowding the deck, and both Applejack and Big Mac took a side, Applejack bucking out apples with pin-point precision and knocking the birds back, while Big Mac just demolished them with wide swipes of his claws.</p><p class="double">“Please! Stop this, you don&#039;t want to get hurt...” Fluttershy tried to reach out to the birds, and recoiled with a whimper as she seemed to make contact with them. “They&#039;re not animals! They&#039;re... horrible!”</p><p class="double">“Oh you did <i>not</i> pull that kinda horse-apples with Fluttershy!” Dash growled and flew over the top of the balloon to swoop down on the offending birds. However, it was clear that the gondola wasn&#039;t their main target. Bird after bird swept past the envelope, cruel claws and razor wings slicing at the fabric, creating rent after rent. The cuts healed as they were sealed back together with bursts of purple magic, but it couldn&#039;t quite keep up with the damage.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m loosing lift!” Blueblood yelled, “I&#039;m trying to compensate by feeding in more lift-gas, but my reserves are almost gone! Do something!”</p><p class="double">The Blueblood started to sink and slow down despite the best efforts of the unicorns to support it. Dash and the others did their best to disperse the birds, but there were just too many of them. Twilight was once again trapped by her assumed role, but there were still things she could do. “Every-pony close your eyes!”</p><p class="double">Seeing they had, Twilight&#039;s horn glow changed colour and brightened. Then it suddenly flashed with a burst of brilliant light the other ponies could feel as well as see through their closed eyes. There was a chorus of pained screeches as the entire area was lit to day-light brightness. The birds broke and fled, but the Blueblood had lurched sickeningly and dropped into a free-fall as she diverted her power into the solar flare spell and the power to the triune became unbalanced.</p><p class="double">The ponies on deck grabbed onto whatever they could find, even Fluttershy, who grabbed onto Big Mac. All of them were screaming, though only Pinkie seemed to be enjoying herself. More importantly, Shining Armour and Rarity were lifted off the deck, out of contact with the diagram. Twilight decided she had to up her game and made her horn shimmer with layers of aura, duplicating how she&#039;d once looked when hauling an Ursa Minor around by the scruff of it&#039;s neck..</p><p class="double">The entire air-ship was enveloped in a purple glow as it slowed down, and the ponies were lowered to the deck. The envelope above was half collapsed, the semi-rigid support structure far more semi than rigid and clearly doing nothing to support them. They watched in awe as Twilight floated above the deck, sparks flying from the tip of her horn. The vision of magical power unleashed spoke to them. “Uh... guys? A little help here?”</p><p class="double">That had Shining Armour and Rarity leaping back to their posts. Twilight lowered herself down and re-established the triune. Rainbow Dash cajoled Fluttershy away from her grasp on Big Mac&#039;s giant wood form, and into helping her shove some clouds underneath the keel. Between them, they brought the Blueblood down relatively unscathed in the clearing Twilight had spotted earlier.</p><p class="double">“Whooe!” Applejack exclaimed, “I knew you had power, I didn&#039;t know you had that much!”</p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s do it again!” Pinkie whooped.</p><p class="double">“That was most impressive.” Rarity was checking over her costume to see the free fall hadn&#039;t carried away anything important.</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed, partly from embarrassment at the success of her ploy. “It was a team effort, all of you helped. Besides, I couldn&#039;t let you all get hurt. I&#039;ve hurt enough ponies already.”</p><p class="double">“My beautiful ship...” Blueblood was examining the collapsed balloon sorrowfully.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I&#039;m sure it can be fixed up, and if it can&#039;t, I&#039;m sure Princess Celestia will replace it. You&#039;ve already gotten us a good part of the way... We were on course, weren&#039;t we?”</p><p class="double">Blueblood sniffed, his depression forgotten at the questioning of his skills. “Of course, assuming those maps you found were accurate! We didn&#039;t have time to drift when those birds attacked.”</p><p class="double">“Those weren&#039;t birds. I think they were a manifestation of Nightmare Moon. We know she likes transformations.” Twilight replied, looking over at timber-wolf Big Mac. “That’s why I could drive them away with a solar flare spell.”</p><p class="double">“Oh great!” Rainbow exclaimed, “That means she knows we&#039;re here! Are we going to get more of those scary-crows?”</p><p class="double">To be honest, Twilight wasn&#039;t sure. The changes she&#039;d made had caused Nightmare Moon to react differently. However, she had a pretty good idea of the being&#039;s general mindset, and she could even justify her conclusions with in-loop knowledge.</p><p class="double">“Not those most probably, but she will keep attacking. However, I don&#039;t think she&#039;ll come at us directly, and not for some time. From what Shining told me, and what we saw at the Town Hall, she doesn&#039;t have massive amounts of power in reserve, not if she wants to keep Princess Celestia bound, and strengthen the bindings to make them permanent.</p><p class="double">“She seems to be a creature of illusions and deceptions, changing forms and twisting minds. Even that attack in the Town Hall was transmutation rather than a direct damage spell. She&#039;ll need to husband her power, building up a reserve to attack us each time, so we should have some respite. It&#039;s also likely she&#039;ll try and trick us, or attack us indirectly through a proxy, rather than wasting power with a direct magic attack.”</p><p class="double">She decided to pull in something else ahead of schedule. “Of course, now that we&#039;re down on the ground, I really wish we had a guide, some-pony who knows the hazards of the Everfree. No offense Prince Blueblood, but while I&#039;m sure you can navigate, navigating it safely is another matter.”</p><p class="double">“Sugar-cube, no-pony knows what lives in the Everfree forest!” Applejack exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Because no-pony that goes in, ever comes out!” Rainbow Dash added, stalking across the deck and making Fluttershy squeak.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked over at the far side of the clearing. Zecora&#039;s hut was just visible beyond a screen of trees. She pointed it out to the others. “Well some-pony lives here.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s crazy, who&#039;d live in the...” Applejack went pale, “Zecora!”</p><p class="double">All the Ponyville ponies shivered at the name. Blueblood and Shining Armour just looked confused.</p><p class="double">“Okay, who is this Zecora, and why does she have you all so scared?” Twilight asked, as if she didn&#039;t know.</p><p class="double">“Because she&#039;s eeeeevil!” Pinkie Pie said, waving her fore-hooves in the air.</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s mysterious and scary...” Fluttershy added.</p><p class="double">“All sinister in her cloak and stuff... Not that I&#039;m scared of her, I&#039;m just... worried, yeah worried about every-pony else!” Rainbow Dash added, though the way she had her wings wrapped around her demonstrated that whatever else, she wasn&#039;t the element of honesty.</p><p class="double">“And she has an absolutely garish colour-scheme! Black and white stripes, can you imagine?” Rarity put in.</p><p class="double">“She comes into town about once a month...” Applejack started, only to be corrected by Pinkie Pie. “... creeps evilly into town...” “... and hangs around the stores...” “... lurks around the stores...” “... and paws at the ground...” “... evilly paws at the ground...”</p><p class="double">Twilight scratched the back of her neck with a hoof. “Still not seeing why every-pony&#039;s scared of her. Doesn&#039;t she buy anything at the stores?”</p><p class="double">“Of course not! Every-pony closes up shop and hides when she comes into town!”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around at her friends. She hadn&#039;t liked this the first time she&#039;d heard it, and it didn&#039;t get any better with repetition. She preferred to think the best of her friends, and this was them showing less than their best selves. “So no-pony&#039;s actually talked to her?”</p><p class="double">There was a chorus of denials.</p><p class="double">“Then how can you know anything about her? Wait... when you said black and white stripes, you didn&#039;t mean her clothing, did you?”</p><p class="double">“No, she dyes her coat and mane that way.” Rarity responded.</p><p class="double">“Then she&#039;s a zebra.” Twilight nodded as if confirming a theory.</p><p class="double">“Is that some sort of evil spell-caster?” Pinkie asked.</p><p class="double">“No, zebras are a race of ponies who live in Zebrica, a land far away to the south, far beyond the Macintosh mountains. They&#039;re most similar to earth-ponies with magic that relates to the earth and growing things. However their saganomas, a combination teacher/healer/mage have learned to use their earth magic to cast spells.”</p><p class="double">“So I was right!” The pink pony exclaimed.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Hardly, saganomas are if anything the opposite. Lacking a horn, they compound spells from magical herbs and plants, or use them as a base to invest their own earth magic. Their magic is all about healing, protection and enhancing living things.”</p><p class="double">“Then why is she always creeping about so creepily?”</p><p class="double">“It sounds like no-pony&#039;s given her a chance to do anything else.” Twilight tried to find a way to get through to them. She decide shock tactics might work best. Her horn glowed and she was suddenly zebra striped, with her mane and tail highlights white against black. The Ponyvillians flinched away, but some-pony else laughed.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s so funny?” Rainbow growled at Blueblood, who was the source of the laughter.</p><p class="double">“Just that you Ponyville ponies can be just as judgmental and wrongheaded as Miss Sparkle claimed I was. It&#039;s refreshing, the light from your halos up until now was making me squint, and that does terrible things to the corners of one&#039;s eyes.”</p><p class="double">That got him annoyed looks from the six Ponyville residents until Twilight put in, “Pinkie, you know that it was your upbeat attitude and friendliness that helped me when I first arrived in Ponyville? I&#039;m just glad I wasn&#039;t wearing this as a disguise, you&#039;d have probably hidden under the counter or just bucked me back out.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour spoke up. “I&#039;ve got to admit I&#039;m finding this a bit strange too. Zebras don&#039;t commonly come to Equestria, they don&#039;t even have a full time ambassador in Canterlot, but I&#039;ve done escort duty for their envoys before now. They&#039;re just another type of pony, nice enough folks, nothing to get worried about. Though I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be too happy if I&#039;d been treated the way you say she has.”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to the others. “Guys, I <i>know</i> you&#039;re better than this, shunning some-pony just because she looks different!”</p><p class="double">Applejack chipped in. “T&#039;ain&#039;t so much that as the fact she lives in the Everfree. What sort of pony would do that?”</p><p class="double">That got relieved agreements from most of them, and Twilight dismissed the disguise. She&#039;d never actually explored why they were so scared of Zecora to this extent, and she was happy to know it was less that she looked different than where she lived.</p><p class="double">“A saganoma, as I said earlier. The Everfree has the largest and weirdest range of magical plants and creatures in the world. Saganomas use magical plants in their spells, it might be enough to tempt one to come here and research them.”</p><p class="double">“Or she could be here because she was cast out because she was doing evil things...” Pinkie suggested. “I even wrote a song about it... &#039;She&#039;s an evil enchantrress! She something something prances... enhances... chances... Francis?”</p><p class="double">She came to a stumbling halt as she tried out rhymes. “Well I started a song about her. It&#039;s a work in progress!”</p><p class="double">“Catchy…” Twilight sighed. “Y&#039;know, it&#039;s possible you&#039;re right, not likely, but I suppose any-pony could go off the rails. Even so, we have to go find out. If she was evil, or even has been turned evil as Princess Luna was by Nightmare Moon... after all, the best of ponies would feel a little unhappy at being shunned like that, and from what I understand, that&#039;s exactly the sort of thing a Nightmare exploits... well anyway, if she&#039;s a threat we have to deal with her before we go on, or risk her attacking from behind while Nightmare Moon comes at us from the front.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shivered again and hid behind Big Mac. “Do we really have to?”</p><p class="double">Oddly enough, it was Big Macintosh who answered her. “Eyup! Miss Sparkle&#039;s makin&#039; a passel of sense. Better to meet Zecora now on our terms, than later on hers, I reckon. Besides, I always figured those tales about her were a heapin&#039; helpin&#039; of hooey.”</p><p class="double">Twilight tried to reassure her. “I&#039;ll approach her. I&#039;ve studied zebra magic and know at least something about its capabilities and its limits. As long as I avoid getting hit by any potions or powders I should be fine. It&#039;s the same for every-pony else too. And it&#039;s not like we don&#039;t have magic of our own.”</p><p class="double">“Ohhh!” Pinkie exclaimed. “What if Nightmare Moon&#039;s granted her some of her power?”</p><p class="double">“I should be able to sense that, I got a pretty good read on her magical signature back in Ponyville. But I doubt it, even if Zecora is in league with Nightmare Moon, the Nightmare isn&#039;t the sort to share power, not when she needs it herself so badly. Hopefully she&#039;s just a regular pony and we can get her as a guide instead. That&#039;s how I intend to approach this.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s all well and fine, Twilight, but what&#039;s to stop her pretending to be all nice and then doing the dirty on us?” Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">“You!” Twilight replied. “Or rather your element. The spirit of the element of honesty is within you, and if you focus on it, you should be able to detect whether she&#039;s telling the truth.”</p><p class="double">“I thought we needed those dinguses from that palace to use the Elements?” Applejack scratched the back of her head with a hoof.</p><p class="double">“Uh huh, we need them reunited to activate their full power and create the sixth element, but the spirit already exists in you. Just concentrate on listening to everything that happens with a open and honest heart, and you should be able to sense the truth. I know it&#039;s a lot to ask for you to put aside your distrust of her, but I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t want to see any-pony treated unfairly.”</p><p class="double">Applejack made a scrunchy face. “If&#039;en you say so Twilight...”</p><p class="double">The group got down from the air-ship deck and approached the hut, which was built into a tree. There was light coming from the window s and a thin trail of multi-coloured smoke issuing from a vent in one of the branches, and masks and vials of various concoctions hung from others.</p><p class="double">Twilight gushed as they got nearer. “Oh my gosh! Real fetish masks! I&#039;ve seen pictures, but the real thing... score one for the good guy theory, some are greetings, and some are specifically designed to ward off evil spirits. Quite powerful too, I can sense them from here. I don&#039;t know if they&#039;d keep off nightmare Moon, but she&#039;d have to work for it. Pinkie, looks like you were half right at least, she&#039;s definitely a saganoma, an enchantress.”</p><p class="double">The others clustered behind her as she called out. “Hello? Is any-pony home?”</p><p class="double">There was no answer for a few moments, then a cloaked figure opened the door. The Ponyville ponies gasped or eeked as their natures led them, but Twilight stood firm. The figure pulled the cloak back to reveal she was Zecora. She spoke in a forbidding voice.</p><p class="double">“Leave this place you pony strangers, the Everfree is full of dangers!”</p><p class="double">“Unfortunately, we can&#039;t. I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle. I believe you are Zecora?”</p><p class="double">“You know my name but still come near me? Unlike these others, you do not fear me?” Zecora was questioning, now and sounded slightly surprised.</p><p class="double">“Should I have reason to?” Twilight asked. “You&#039;re clearly a saganoma, and everything I know about them say they&#039;re healers and teachers, who use their powers to help others not hurt them.”</p><p class="double">Zecora smiled. “You know our ways and speak the truth, but your companions clearly need more proof. When to the village I essay, every-pony runs away.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry you were treated like that, but I hope it won&#039;t prejudice you against my request. You&#039;ve noticed the sun hasn&#039;t come up on schedule?”</p><p class="double">“Even now I make a brew to scry the cause and what to do.”</p><p class="double">“I can help you there.” Twilight explained what had just happened in Ponyville. She gave Zecora the hoof-clipping version of Nightmare Moon&#039;s origin, and how she was defeated the first time. She did a quick and very obvious scan spell to detect if Nightmare Moon was anywhere in the area (which also encompassed Zecora) before continuing. </p><p class="double">“The only way to stop Nightmare Moon as far as we know is to find the Elements. According to our information the Palace of the Two Pony Sisters deep in the Everfree is the place to look. We were headed there by air-ship, but we were forced down. We will have to continue on hoof, but we need a guide, some-pony who knows the dangers of the Everfree and how to avoid them. Right now, the only pony who fits the bill is you.”</p><p class="double">The zebra looked thoughtful. “It&#039;s true those ruins I do know, and find the safest ways to go...” She glanced at the Ponyville mares. “...my presence though <i>they</i> won&#039;t abide, a grave shortcoming in a guide.”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle turned to look at the still nervous mane cast. “Guys, I&#039;ve scanned the area, no signs of Nightmare Moon&#039;s contamination anywhere. And Zecora is willing to help us. I think we should at least say thank you. Applejack?”</p><p class="double">The mare in question had done her best to quell her fear and listen to the exchanges. Twilight was setting great store by this element business, and while she was pleased by the complement, the farm mare wasn&#039;t exactly sold on the idea that she had some mystical magic power inside her... apart from the standard issue earth pony ones. However, Applejack had never been a quitter, and she prided herself on being dependable.</p><p class="double">So she&#039;d done her best to listen to what the striped mare was saying, and so far, it hadn&#039;t been anything like she&#039;d expected. Her weird way of rhyming wasn&#039;t normal, but the words held little of the rancor she&#039;d expected. Indeed, she sounded a lot like a younger version of Granny Smith, wise and self assured. Something inside Applejack resonated with that, made her want to trust the other mare, but she mentally shied back.</p><p class="double">What if it was a trick, what about the stories... Now she thought back on them, her stubborn sense of integrity was worrying at them. How exactly had they started? She couldn&#039;t remember, but they were things every-pony knew... of course, Granny Smith always said &#039;If every-pony knows it, but no-pony can prove it, there&#039;s a good chance every-ponies wrong.&#039;</p><p class="double">She made a decision. It wasn&#039;t an easy decision, or a comfortable one, but it felt like the right one. “Ah apologise Miss Zecora. I normally have better manners. I&#039;m Applejack and I&#039;d be only too glad to ask you to lead us through the forest.” She looked over at the others. “Folks, I think we&#039;ve been doing the lady a disservice, both here and in Ponyville. I intend to make amends. Miss Zecora, when next you come to town, please stop on by Sweet Apple Acres and I&#039;ll make you one of my special apple pies.”</p><p class="double">The zebra smiled. “Your change of heart is most insightful. The pie too would be most delightful.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shrugged and called down from where she was hovering. “I guess if Applejack thinks your on the level, I&#039;m okay with it. I&#039;m Rainbow Dash, Dash to my friends, awesome to every-pony else. Welcome aboard.”</p><p class="double">Rarity hesitated for a moment, then put on a warm smile. She&#039;d been a part of the gossip, but she knew how that same gossip could get out of hoof, and now she met the pony face to face, she was feeling more than slightly guilty over her part in shunning the zebra, especially as both Twilight and Applejack had given her the all clear. Not to mention it rankling that <i>Blueblood</i> of all ponies had called her on it. The generous side of her nature kicked in.</p><p class="double">“Rarity, maker of fine couture. I should apologise as well. If you are in need of a new cloak or something I would be only to happy to supply it.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy just squeaked &#039;I&#039;m sorry!&#039;, but gave a nod.</p><p class="double">Pinkie was the hardest sell. She gave an uncharacteristic frown, staring at the zebra but finally gave an equally uncharacteristic sigh. “Okie-dokie-lokie! But I&#039;ll be watching...”</p><p class="double">The zebra mare actually laughed. “Pink pony, what do you think I&#039;d do? Gobble you up in a big tasty stew?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie brightened up. “Hey, that&#039;s a good line! I can use that!”</p><p class="double">The stallions were a lot less trouble, they introduced themselves, and then Twilight looked around at the newly enlarged. Party. As Zecora slung a set of oddly shaped saddle-bags over her flanks, the purple unicorn asked, “Shall we get on then? We&#039;ve still got a long way to go.” </p><p><hr></p><p>30.2</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So... let me get this straight. Twilight walked in on ya with a bunch o&#039; duplicates of her brother?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis flinched. &quot;It wasn&#039;t like I planned it. The hive took the initiative to comfort me. And we didn&#039;t do anything, you know, I know how intimate you ponies think sex is....&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh raised an eyebrow. &quot;Ah&#039;d say it&#039;s more then just us ponies--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Basically, as Changeling Queen, I&#039;m in charge of having everyone else&#039;s eggs.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a quiet moment.</p><p class="double">Finally, the stallion managed a strangled cough. &quot;Why is it Ah&#039;m always tha one that people explain weird sex things to?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because you serve the best cider.&quot; Chrysalis held forth her mug expectantly, and he filled it without thinking. &quot;Anyway, my point <i>was</i> that I wasn&#039;t aching for a good rut. Frankly, I can get that anywhere, just shapeshift and flirt. But what I had with Shi--well, with <i>my</i> Shining was more then that, and that&#039;s what the hive mind tried to mimic. It kind of worked... in the same way that sugar-free chocolate replacement stuff kind of tastes like Pinkie&#039;s best brownies. So... they decided to multiply the experience...&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh nodded. &quot;Ah see. And that&#039;s when Twilight walked in on ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot; She threw back her muzzle, draining her mug in one big gulp. &quot;I wish I got drunk easier. Half of this is going straight to my mane...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... from tha sound of it... the hive mind <i>was</i> trying ta help ya. In its own way.&quot; The stallion shook his head. &quot;Never really understood it mahself, but from what mah sister and her friends have told me it&#039;s something real... deep.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis regarded him with a curious look. &quot;How would they know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Most o&#039; them have been changelings in one loop or another. Apparently there was even one time where they all were changelings. Heck, Ah&#039;d say tha majority of Equestrian loopers have been in tha hive, cepting mahself fer some reason. Oh, and tha nonpony loopers, like Spike or Discord.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. Discord?&quot; The changeling queen leaned forward. &quot;As in, primordial manifestation of Chaos Discord? He&#039;s looping? That explains so much--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No it don&#039;t. He was always like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...oh. Huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup, that was mah reaction too.&quot; Macintosh shrugged. &quot;Anyway, what Ah&#039;m saying is Ah don&#039;t really get tha hive mind. Yet. Ah&#039;m pretty much resigned to tha fact that Ah&#039;m going ta end up there in some loop. What&#039;s it like, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Didn&#039;t you just say that Twilight and her friends told you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... they were in it fer a few loops at most. You&#039;ve lived with it yer whole life. Makes sense ya&#039;d have a different take on it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. &quot;There is... an old adage. The hive serves the swarm, the swarm serves the queen, the queen serves the hive. It&#039;s... difficult to explain, but... while I have a level of control over the swarm, and I mean actual control and not just the political power that Celestia has over the nobles, the hive is something I... don&#039;t control. If a drone feels that something about what I want them to do is wrong, I can feel it no matter whether I order them to do it or not. Being a queen means you get to make all the decisions, but it also means you feel all the repercussions. Personally, I mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">She sighed. &quot;It&#039;s part of why... well, in my baseline loop, anyway, it was part of why I wasn&#039;t at all worried about attacking ponies. I could slap you right now and read your emotions, but... it&#039;s like the difference between reading a letter and talking to a friend, I suppose. Or maybe listening to a song instead of a speech... Something in that way. The others, they probably see the hive as more intimate, but from my view it&#039;s ponies that are less intimate. And when I was just a queen, I thought that meant you <i>cared</i> less then changelings did, that somehow you were... broken, and it was okay for me to consider you all basically talking prey that we could capture and raise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh realized where she was going with this, pouring more cider into her mug. &quot;But then Shining happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Not just him. He was a big part, but that whole loop was... different. Hives were smaller, and Celestia exterminated us when she could because she believed in preemptive strikes; the other nobles went along with it because the branding magical stuff didn&#039;t work on shapeshifters. And between that and all the slaves running through the underground, I realized that just because you can&#039;t... feel each other, that doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t care. In fact I found that your love can sometimes go deeper, exactly because you&#039;re so alone and want to let the other one know you care.&quot; Chrysalis brought her mug to her lips... and peered at it. &quot;See, this is what I&#039;m talking about right here. If you were part of the hive, you would feel what I was feeling and have filled this without me asking because you knew I was becoming emotional. But you&#039;re not, and you&#039;re not even empathetic... but you know me enough to predict I needed this. How do you do that? How can you read me when you don&#039;t even speak that language? How has your race survived this long without being able to communicate on that level, and yet somehow managed to form deeper relations in that void?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah ain&#039;t no philosopher,&quot; Macintosh began slowly, &quot;but if Ah were ta seriously consider that question... Ah&#039;d say that it&#039;s exactly because we don&#039;t have such close understandings of each other that we strive ta form deep relations. If&#039;n we knew what we&#039;d each be doing all tha time, we wouldn&#039;t be driven ta understand each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But... you could hurt each other. On accident, even.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.... and that&#039;s part of why we try to understand.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen sipped her cider. She still didn&#039;t quite understand... but that viewpoint would be one she would have to consider. </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">30.3</p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Shining Armor asked, frowning. “Is this correct?”</p><p class="double">“Is what correct, BBBFF?” Twilight replied, still scanning over the list as she helped things get set up for the Equestria Games.</p><p class="double">“Well, I was looking over the contestant list, and… you’ve only put down <i>three</i>.”</p><p class="double">Twilight craned her head to look. “Uh… yep, that’s right. That’s the only entrants we’re sending.”</p><p class="double">“For <i>all</i> the games?” Shining shook his head. “Twilight, I know that Ponyville is a small town, relatively speaking, but usually small towns take this as an opportunity for everypony to show off their talents. You know, have a bit of fun.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry.” Twilight shrugged. “We’ll be fine.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Rainbow Dash hunched down, grinning like a loon. Her wings flared up to give her a starter’s boost, and when the gate came down-</p><p class="double">She finished, sat down on the other side of the tape, and began eating a snack carrot.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Wait, what just happened?” the race marshal said, checking a stopwatch. “That was… did she seriously do the marathon in ten seconds flat?”</p><p class="double">“Nine point nine three,” Rainbow said, then frowned and threw her carrot away. “Man, I must be putting on weight… I’m getting slow.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight ticked the first box on her checklist. “Right, that’s swifter done…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Fluttershy looked up at the high jump, wings strapped. “Er… I have to get over that?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, you do,” a helper said helpfully. “Just do your best.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” The shy pegasus crouched down, then sprang…</p><p class="double">And just kept on going up.</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight ticked the second box, <i>higher</i>, as Fluttershy cleared the cross-bar. “Certainly helps if you’ve got literal control over the muscles in your legs… and weighing as little as <i>she</i> does can’t hurt either. Right, two down, one to go.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Applejack slammed her front hooves on the arena floor. “An’ who else is after a go at me?”</p><p class="double">All the other competitors looked at her. Then they looked at the huge pegasus embedded in a wall.</p><p class="double">“None of y’all? Aww, that ain’t fair on me…”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Twilight, that was a terrible thing you did there,” Celestia admonished, covering her mouth to hide a smile.</p><p class="double">“I know, I know…” Twilight shrugged, passing over the scroll with <i>stronger</i> ticked next to the other two. “Normally we sit them out, but I felt like they needed a go at least once. Especially Fluttershy.”</p><p class="double">“True, she’s not exactly the most confident of ponies…” the Princess allowed, accepting the scroll. “Strange how much ponies stay the same, in the loops.”</p><p class="double">“I think it’s because she actually <i>likes</i> being shy, you know…” Twilight ventured. “It’s a part of how she is, and it makes her more sure she’s not going to offend anypony. And she hates to offend…”</p><p class="double">“Most insightful,” Celestia said, nodding to Twilight. “Well, do congratulate your friends. And I might well award copper medals this Games, because otherwise it’s just going to not be fair on the ponies who <i>would</i> have been third place.”</p><p class="double">“I’m wondering how we’re going to get Dash home, actually,” Twilight confided. “That many medals might actually impede her takeoff.”</p><p><hr></p><p>30.4 (Elmagnifico)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed as he trotted through Ponyville, the day’s load of apples for market creaking along behind him. It was just after the start of a fresh reunion, and the denizens were just starting to get back to normal after the Summer Sun Celebration. Thus far, no-one had disturbed his routine. None of his sisters were Awake, and nothing remarkable had happened. He’d delivered the apple to the library on schedule. Nightmare Moon had been vanquished with a zebra potion, two pry bars and several metric tons of fruitcake. A slow day outside the bar, a good sign for the loop. </p><p class="double">Spike waved to him as he passed by on his way to Celestia-knew-where. The little drake was friendly enough, in fact the two of them were pretty close to brothers-in-arms, being the only male Loopers aside from Twilight’s brother, who was a decent stallion too. Overall, a good friend, and seeing as how he was Awake, not in need of Mac’s immediate attention. He was confident Spike could handle whatever the loops threw and if he needed assistance with something the others couldn’t help with, he’d seek Mac out. Even his ability to turn into a ten-story powerhouse hardly made Mac twitch anymore. </p><p class="double">It hadn’t always been that way though. </p><p class="double">When he’d first been introduced to the community of Loopers, he’d seen big things. The most obvious, of course, being the extra parts each of Applejack’s friends were able to sprout at will. Others included subspace pockets, glowing swords, hornless telekinesis and underground bases with flying machines and fusion reactors. So many things were different among the Loopers. </p><p class="double">Applebloom jumped off the cart and trotted away, as the way to school diverged from the route to market. She shouted a goodbye over her shoulder as Mac watched her, frowning in thought but paused to wave in case she looked back. Oftentimes the bullying on that front was solved in as simple a way as having a conversation with Filthy Rich, although it’d taken a few attempts to get the phrasing right so that Diamond Tiara would be chastised. Being too direct with the well-to-do pony didn’t get anywhere. </p><p class="double">At first, the Loopers had presented a problem. Applejack’s friends were important ponies, helping them helped all of Equestria, not only because they were Elements of Harmony, but because helping them headed off a lot of the larger problems around Ponyville during the loop. So, over the course of his Loops he’d gotten to know them rather well, helping each with their issues and getting it down to the point where, all other things being equal, Ponyville stayed rather quiet after the initial Nightmare Night bump. </p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash zoomed overhead, her contrail reminding Macintosh he needed to get in touch with her soon. Now that the Celebration was over, she’d be more obsessed with the Wonderbolts than ever. It would take a while to establish contact, and most of his help would be second or third-hoof. He really never came into contact with her unless something went drastically wrong, usually with one of her manoeuvres, either sending her crashing into something on the Acres, or himself. </p><p class="double">Naturally, each change he’d made had altered how things played out, which meant new issues would crop up from the fresh circumstances. Over time he’d honed his perception, allowing him to preempt trouble and head off developing problems before they hurt anyone. He’d gotten especially good at reading the Elements. </p><p class="double">He waved as he passed the unawake Rarity, doubtless on her way back to the Carousel Boutique. Her input would be needed later to alter how Applejack prepped her food stall for the Grand Galloping Gala, with fewer, more refined baked goods and the like. Blunting the unfortunate and unavoidable disappointment with Blueblood would come after. </p><p class="double">Only now, they were completely different. He knew almost nothing about these ponies, and they’d already solved their problems their own way. Moreover, with all the horns and wings showing up, he’d had a hard time keeping up with the Loopers. Getting under their masks when they were around Ponyville was hard, as, like him, they’d be trying to blend in. When they weren’t trying to keep things close to baseline, he felt left behind as the phenomenal cosmic power and strange magic started flying willy-nilly. Helping was hard when you were too busy dodging disintegration spells to watch anyone else. </p><p class="double">Fluttershy meeped in surprise as he left her a smile. He often wound up spending a disproportionate amount of time around her, as preempting the parasprites was easier said than done. She was a delicate case indeed, as increasing her confidence without doing the same harm as that Minotaur was a balancing act that left almost no margin for error. </p><p class="double">It wasn’t until Applejack awoke one loop and stayed in her bed, fitfully dreaming, through the whole Reunion, only to proceed down to the cellar and drink their entire stock of her namesake, along with the rest of the alcohol, that Mac found his place in the Loops. Being the queen of the Changelings had rattled his sister fiercely, and left her needing family and counselling, in that order. Twilight had been eager to assist Mac with his sister, and together they’d helped her cope. </p><p class="double">He responded to Time Turner’s query about Applejack’s recovery with an “Eeyup.” The Celebration usually left his sister fatigued, both physically and mentally, even if the Elements weren’t used to defeat Nightmare Moon. Having a Goddess of the Night dropped on the town tended to have that effect. Applejack hated being useless, and now she was taking it relatively easy at the Acres, just a few light chores. Of course, that meant he had to pick up the slack, but by now he knew just how much he could push himself before getting injured. </p><p class="double">It was during that session of post-hive-mind therapy that Macintosh realized these ponies needed his help just as much as their non-looping selves did. Of course, chasing them around to watch them and try to preempt problems was a fruitless dream. He simply didn’t Loop enough for that. There was too much separation for him to help the Anchor and her friends the way he did Ponyville. </p><p class="double">He returned Cherilee’s smile as usual. He normally kept his distance from the schoolmarm at first, although he did have to watch his beverages in February. That particular thread usually resolved itself with subtle changes in how he acted around Applebloom, with hints he was interested in this mare or that one, nothing blatant or false, but enough to keep him off the &quot;eligible bachelors&quot; list. Getting Cherilee to change the timing of the field trip until one of the Crusader’s less chaotic periods was the real challenge. </p><p class="double">So, he’d started a bar. Alcohol still held its allure even for Loopers, and Apples knew how to brew the best stuff. Moreover, its presence relaxed most ponies, allowing him to see under the barriers they had erected to keep out the strife and erosion of time. It also allowed them to come and seek him out if they needed help or guidance, even if initiating therapy was often disguised, or rationalized, as a request for booze. </p><p class="double">He passed Lily and her friends, which brought Zecora to mind. That, at least, was as simple as helping Applejack see through the rumours and hearsay surrounding the zebra. After her sense of truth was applied properly to the situation, his sister handled that well enough by herself. </p><p class="double">Nevertheless, the bar was a small thing. Everything had to be available at loop’s start in case of an emergency, so he kept the furnishings to a minimum. After all, he’d only made it a public establishment in three especially crowded loops, after which he’d decided it was better to keep things simple. The Apple cellar served just as well as an above-ground building for Looper purposes. Wooden furniture was simple and common, but also relaxing, homely and unassuming. A stone fireplace made the place cozy and required minimal modification of the basement, aside from the ventilation. Overall, it reminded him of the small pubs he’d seen the one time the Loops had moved Ponyville to the Northern Dales, albeit with a more varied selection on tap. </p><p class="double">He halted as Berry Punch teetered across the street in front of him, thoroughly sloshed as per normal. No helping that, unfortunately. </p><p class="double">Most loops the emergency stock of Hard Cider was enough to tide over thirsty patrons until he could start brewing for larger crowds, although there were a couple barrels and microbrews he asked Twilight to keep in her subspace pocket and drop off at her earliest convenience whenever he was Awake. He was saving those for a special occasion. </p><p class="double">He noted the extra spring in Pinkie Pie’s step as she passed him on the way to Sugarcube Corner. Looper or not, he wasn’t sure. Maybe she was just happy because of the baked-goods manner in which the Alicorn of the Night had been defeated. He could never be sure with her. </p><p class="double">The pink mare had always been an enigma to him, in some ways worse than Ms. Sparkle because she stood up to close scrutiny and remained just as unfathomable whether she was looping or not. He could tell the difference, it just didn&#039;t help any in predicting her. Distracting her on her birthday had been easy enough. Physically bumping into her, apologizing and then helping her with some baking seemed enough, although her sheer variability meant nothing was certain. </p><p class="double">Nevertheless, she proved an ally more often than not. After all, their missions were similar. Indeed, oftentimes there was little that would help ponies more than a smile or a good laugh, and that was something Pinkie Pie excelled at giving. Conversely, Mac was always happy to cater or host a party. Stress relief and games were a good way to blow off steam, and it lightened his workload when he didn’t have to pour every drink himself. </p><p class="double">He was almost to the market when he spotted Twilight Sparkle a little ways off, conversing with a pegasus he didn’t recognize. Spike and a small black dragon were behind them, apparently comparing notes of some sort. They all waved, and Twilight looked like she was moving to intercept, so he’d likely be introduced to these newcomers. A fused loop? </p><p class="double">Mac gave the oncoming party a welcoming smile and mentally sighed as he bid any hopes of a quiet loop goodbye.</p><p><hr></p><p>30.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...so why isn&#039;t Silver looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom gave Diamond Tiara a look as she drove in the next piton. &quot;Yer asking this <i>now?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you rather I whine about how hard this is?&quot; the purple filly countered, panting as she attempted to reach another hoofhold. &quot;Cause, you know, I could do that if you like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh. Point.&quot; Bloom stretched, barely managing to grab an outcropping of rock. &quot;But that was only a five.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tiara snorted. &quot;Oh darn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, so... ya know how Twilight&#039;s tha anchor?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah?&quot; The purple filly pushed herself up. &quot;That means she loops all the time, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah. More important, though, that means all tha looping... loopiness, Ah guess, flows from her. And if thar&#039;s enough loopiness, thar&#039;s a new looper. Ah think.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not sure?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom pulled another piton out of her backpack. &quot;Well, Ah&#039;m trying ta explain something that Twilight told me with all tha technobabble she explained. It might be that it&#039;s looseness in tha memory network of our reality or somethang... she has holographic diagrams, Ah&#039;m simplifying.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s back hoof slipped off. &quot;AAA! Ah, sorry, I&#039;m okay, I&#039;m fine.&quot; She panted as she recovered her footing. &quot;Alright, so... Twilight&#039;s the center of looping. Got that. And things get loopier over time....?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tha thing is, tha loopiness travels along... channels made by deep emotional impact. So, it went from her ta her friends first. Then it went from her to tha princesses. Then it went from her, through Applejack and Rarity and Rainbow Dash, to tha Crusaders....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.&quot; The rich filly nodded to herself. &quot;I&#039;m beginning to see the pattern. Friends first?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Friends, family... and some pretty personal enemies.&quot; The farm filly nodded at her piton, pulling herself up. &quot;Like Chrysalis, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, Chrysalis? As in the Changeling Queen? She&#039;s looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup. Took her a while, but tha fact is she did leave a deep emotional impact on Twilight in tha baseline, so all Twilight had ta do was focus on her a bit more. Ah hate ta say it but, well, tha reason ya probably started looping is cause ya bullied us so intensely. Silver Spoon was always just following yer lead, so we didn&#039;t care that much about her. She&#039;s got a deeper channel ta you, o&#039; course, but by tha time tha loopiness reaches ya--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m too far out from the center.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah. Fer now anyway.&quot; Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Could be she gets in, eventually. Heck, if ya like, me and tha other crusaders could try ta be her friends fer tha next few loops, it would give her a better chance of waking up... Ah think. Ah&#039;m not sure.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara considered it. &quot;I... don&#039;t want to force you to do anything you don&#039;t want to, but... well, she was my first friend. If you would try, that would mean a lot to me...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh. Ah&#039;ll bring it up at tha next Crusader meeting. Course, Loopiness is a tad bit random. Sometimes ponies start looping when it don&#039;t make no sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean like Nyx?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Apple Bloom lugged herself onto a ledge and pulled Diamond Tiara up. &quot;She&#039;s one example, yeah, but Ah was thinking more like Berry Punch.&quot;</p><p class="double">The rich filly blinked. &quot;Wait, Berry Punch? The town drunk? She&#039;s looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, once or twice. Doesn&#039;t make sense ta me either. By all rights Granny Smith shoulda been looping by now, and Berry oughta have been further out. Still... ya get what ya get, Ah guess. And it&#039;s not like it&#039;s anything as consistent as you or me anyway...&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>31.1 (Anowack)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis, Queen of the Changeling Swam, actually had been quite fond of tea.</p><p class="double">It was a habit she&#039;d picked up from one of the first ponies she had fed on extensively, a middle-aged divorced mare in Manehatten with a weak spot for young fillies with sob stories, too much spare time under her hooves, and a dangerously unquestioning nature. The scent and taste of the beverage brought memories of those simpler days to Chrysalis&#039;s mind, and in her personal chambers deep inside the hive could be found the battered tea set she&#039;d stolen after the mare had died, along with some small containers of carefully hoarded leaves.</p><p class="double">She hadn&#039;t drank tea since she had started Looping. The once fond memories were now tainted by the gnawing sensation of guilt. She half-feared, half-hoped that if she dared to dwell on those days too much she would find that she missed the aging pony who had always been ready to offer her a cup of tea, two chocolate chip cookies, and a shoulder to fake-sob on.</p><p class="double">“Would you prefer something else to drink?” the mare seated across the small table from the changeling queen asked.</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s fine,” Chrysalis answered, staring morosely at Cadance&#039;s reflection in the still, gently steaming liquid. That was the last form she wanted to take – she could have gone a thousand Loops without ever seeing that pink-furred face again – but her companion had offered it as a simple way for them to have their conversation in pleasant surroundings without attracting unwanted attention.</p><p class="double">Indeed the various ponies who passed by the balcony where they sat barely gave the two (apparent) alicorns having tea a second glance, but Chrysalis was fairly certain the suggestion had been a way to put her off balance, or a test, or both.</p><p class="double">If it was a test, she had probably failed, she concluded, but it was too late now.</p><p class="double">“I must admit I was surprised when Rainbow Dash brought you to me,” Princess Celestia said as she raised her own tea in golden light and took a sip.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t need to explain why. “I&#039;m not sure of the details myself. I didn&#039;t even realize what was happening at first.” Chrysalis caught herself before saying &#039;Princess Twilight,&#039; the habit of her second lifetime still hard to break. “Twilight Sparkle has an explanation for why I started to Loop that she is satisfied with, at least.”</p><p class="double">“Not that. After Nyx, I expect I shall hardly ever be surprised by who can start Looping again.” The true alicorn chuckled briefly. “Usually I&#039;ve heard of newcomers from Twilight several Loops before getting a chance to meet them myself.”</p><p class="double">There was an awkward silence for several moments.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve not spoken with her of me?” Chrysalis asked finally.</p><p class="double">“No,” Celestia said.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039;s throat was dry suddenly, and she forced herself to take a gulp of the tea before speaking. If Twilight hadn&#039;t explained, she could only imagine what Celestia was thinking, what she might do. The green aura engulfing her teacup flickered for an instant. “I swear,” Chrysalis said quickly. “I am no threat to Equestria, to your ponies.”</p><p class="double">Celestia put down her teacup. Chrysalis followed suit a second later, trying not to squirm under the Princess&#039;s piercing gaze. This was the real Princess Celestia, veteran of probably more Loops than Chrysalis could imagine. She was no doubt vastly stronger than either Celestia Chrysalis had fought before, fully capable of squashing her like... well, a bug. She certainly had done it, too, dozens or hundreds of times.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re terrified of me,” Celestia said, something in her voice the changeling couldn&#039;t identify.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked down, strands of Cadance&#039;s tri-colored mane falling through her vision. “Of course,” she whispered.</p><p class="double">“Look up,” Celestia ordered, and Chrysalis obeyed immediately. “Why?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis felt her mouth open in surprise. “Who wouldn&#039;t be?” she asked without thinking, dumbfounded.</p><p class="double">It couldn&#039;t be hurt she saw in the Princess&#039;s eyes. “I would think one of the very few who can say they defeated me fairly in single combat,” she said. Her mouth twitched briefly. “Over a dozen times from my perspective. You&#039;re shockingly powerful when well-fed.”</p><p class="double">The last thing Chrysalis needed was a reminder that Celestia had cause to seek <i>personal</i> revenge. She didn&#039;t dare look away, couldn&#039;t move.</p><p class="double">Celestia frowned. “You said you didn&#039;t realize you were Looping at first.”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Tears welled unbidden in Chrysalis&#039;s eyes. “I thought the... real timeline, was a dream.”</p><p class="double">“What happened?” Celestia asked. “<i>What did I do?</i>”</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight Sparkle had known this would be an interesting loop from the moment she&#039;d Awoken as a pegasus filly in the sky city of Cloudsdale. A memory check showed her family had been similarly transformed and transported, while a brief investigation discovered that Rainbow Dash – the only other Element Awake this time – and her family had taken their place as Canterlot unicorns.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re really doing better, Fluttershy,” Twilight encouraged her friend, gesturing with one wing to try and get the yellow filly to fly the short distance between her cloud and the one Twilight rested on. Twilight knew that in the original timeline Rainbow Dash hadn&#039;t befriended Fluttershy until some months down the line, but she hadn&#039;t seen any reason to wait. “You&#039;ll be ready for summer flight camp in no time.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy inched up to the edge of her cloud, peeking out from behind her hooves. “It&#039;s so far.”</p><p class="double">Twilight didn&#039;t know whether she meant the distance between them or the distance to the foundation cloud below, but neither was terribly long. “You&#039;ll be fine, Fluttershy,” she said comfortingly. “I promise.”</p><p class="double">Instead of taking heart, Fluttershy gasped and scooted back.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy? What&#039;s wrong?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Somepony&#039;s coming!” The yellow filly hunkered down, trying to sink into the cloud.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around and laughed when she saw the older, white pegasus flying closer. “Don&#039;t worry; I know her.”</p><p class="double">The mare settled onto the cloud next to her. “Hi, Twily; is this your new friend?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “This is Fluttershy.” The named filly let out a quiet whimper. “Fluttershy, this is my big sister, Gleaming Shield.” It wasn&#039;t the first time Twilight&#039;s sibling had been a mare, or a pegasus, but Twilight was fairly sure it was for both at once. (Twilight had checked, and Cadance was still female this Loop. That hadn&#039;t stopped her from getting together with Gleaming in a few past Loops, though the fact that Twilight&#039;s sister was currently dating a stallion she&#039;d met training for Wonderbolts tryouts suggested this Loop might be an exception.)</p><p class="double">“Hi!” Gleaming said, waving a hoof at Fluttershy, then looking at Twilight. “Twily, there&#039;s a filly named Sunny Skies at home asking for you. Says you need to work on a project for school?”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned, just long enough for Gleaming to notice, then quickly forced a smile. “I&#039;d almost forgotten that. I&#039;m sorry, Fluttershy, I have to go. I&#039;ll see you tomorrow, okay?”</p><p class="double">Twilight took the quiet noise from her friend as assent, and shortly thereafter was back at home, alone in her room with a pale-furred, pink-maned filly about her age. “Is something wrong, Princess Celestia?” she asked her visitor.</p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash brought me a surprising guest this morning,” Celestia said.</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“I had a very interesting and informative conversation over tea with Queen Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Twilight said again, a little more weakly.</p><p class="double">“Twilight, why didn&#039;t you tell me?” Celestia&#039;s voice was sad.</p><p class="double">“I was planning to play some kind of prank on you with her,” Twilight said. “She&#039;s... a little unsure of herself and her place now; I thought that would help break the ice.” And the look on Celestia&#039;s face would have almost certainly been priceless.</p><p class="double">Celestia just looked at the other filly for a moment. “That&#039;s not what I meant, and I think you know it, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">Twilight swallowed. “Oh,” she said one more time. She forced a laugh. “It&#039;s hardly the first time I&#039;ve had to fight a version of you in a weird Loop.”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Celestia agreed. “You&#039;ve stopped me as Infernal Blaze from roasting Equestria under eternal day and asked me to critique your strategy the next time we met. You teased me about the Loop where I was Discord&#039;s queen for what must have been a thousand years at least from your perspective. We dealt with that version of me trying to forcefully transform all of Earth into ponies together.</p><p class="double">“You didn&#039;t want to talk to me about this Loop.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sat back and tried to find words. She didn&#039;t want to talk about it, but she knew better. “Those ponies might have been Celestia, but they weren&#039;t <i>you</i>,” she said finally.</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled slightly. “We don&#039;t quite have the right words in our language for the Loops, do we?” she asked.</p><p class="double">“I have a paper I wrote one Loop somewhere,” Twilight said, eager to change the subject, and started searching her subspace pocket.</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s smile widened, but she turned serious again quickly. “I assure you, Twilight. If I had been Awake that Loop, you would have been well aware within moments.” Her voice promised cleansing solar fires that probably would not have actually ensued – as viscerally satisfying as it might have been, Celestia of course knew that destruction would not have really solved anything.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “That&#039;s not what I meant.” She glanced about her room for inspiration, finally hitting on a photo of her sister from her time at the Wonderbolts Academy. “In this loop, my sister is aiming to join the Wonderbolts, like baseline Rainbow Dash,” she said after a moment. Celestia nodded, and Twilight continued. “It&#039;s not so different from how Shining wanted to join your Guard. She and her coltfriend sneak around the same way Shining and Cadance did. She <i>is</i> Shining.”</p><p class="double">“I think I catch your meaning,” Celestia said, her small filly&#039;s wings shuffling slightly, “but I am not sure I like it.”</p><p class="double">“You think I <i>do</i>?” Twilight Sparkle asked, more harshly than she intended. “The Infernal Blazes, the tyrant Empresses, the crazed madmares; they aren&#039;t you. They are different ponies.”</p><p class="double">“And this Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“That Celestia bought me off the auction block at the Royal Canterlot Slave market, separating me from my family for what that me knew was almost certainly forever,” Twilight said, “but she also held me when I cried that night. When we fought she almost cried herself as she begged me to explain why I rebelled. She loved me, I think, maybe as much as you do.”</p><p class="double">“If she did,” Celestia said angrily, “she would never have allowed you to be a slave. Do you think so little of me, Twilight Sparkle?”</p><p class="double">“No!” Twilight said, too loudly. “It&#039;s... if she&#039;d been <i>evil</i>, it would have been easy. But she wasn&#039;t. She was almost you. I could look at her and see you. She spoke like you, acted like you, fought like you.”</p><p class="double">“Except she was a slaver,” Celestia said.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight said. “Except for that. And I loved her, that Loop&#039;s me. I hated her, but I loved her too, and I hated myself for loving her. And I... <i>this</i> me... I feel like I failed you somehow. She was almost you, and I hurt her terribly and...”</p><p class="double">Celestia reached over and hugged her. “I won&#039;t forgive you, Twilight Sparkle,” she said softly, and the purple pegasus sobbed, “but only because I know you did nothing that needs forgiveness. But I can tell you, that if that Celestia really was almost me, if she really did love you like I do, she forgave you in the end, no matter how badly you think you hurt her.”</p><p class="double">Twilight couldn&#039;t stop crying, burying her face under Celestia&#039;s wing. “I&#039;m sorry,” she said.</p><p class="double">“I told you,” Celestia said. “You did nothing wrong.”</p><p class="double">“I... we should have had this conversation Loops ago,” Twilight said, slowly disentangling herself. “I&#039;m sorry for that.”</p><p class="double">“For that, I do forgive you,” Celestia said, smiling gently.</p><p class="double">There was a knocking on Twilight&#039;s door. “Is everything okay in there, Twilight?” her father asked, a little worry plain in his voice.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight said, her voice steady. “We&#039;re fine now.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.2 (Masterweaver, Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Space.... the final frontier.</p><p class="double">These are the voyages of the starship Ponydrive. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life, and new civilization. To boldly go where noone has gone before.</p><p class="double">We join our crew as captain Twilight Sparkle strides onto the bridge. The unicorn&#039;s a little young for command, but from the way she carries herself she&#039;s confident in her ability. &quot;Helmsman, status.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re still on course sir,&quot; reports the pegasus working the helm, and if Twilight was young then this pony was practically a child.</p><p class="double">&quot;Keep her steady, Scootaloo. We need this survey done by the end of the week.&quot; Twilight turns to what looks, at first glance, to be a bright pink pony. &quot;I hope your circuits aren&#039;t giving you too much trouble.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Negativo, captain! You&#039;d need a lot more then a simple science survey to stumble a Positronic Intelligence Equestrian!&quot; The pink pony leans back. &quot;Truth be told, it&#039;s been kind of boring. Don&#039;t these loops usually have some sort of excitement in them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I agree with Pinkie.&quot; A blue pegasus glances up from her console, flicking her rainbow mane out of the way. &quot;I mean, I&#039;m the chief of security, and things look pretty darn secure!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That means you&#039;re doing your job right, <i>lieutenant.</i>&quot; An ivory unicorn gives her a serious look. &quot;Stay in character, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, fine Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Commander, sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirks. &quot;Apology accepted, Lieutenant Dash. Lieutenant Pinkie, keep up the scans.&quot; She sits in her chair, stretching out her hooves. &quot;So, Spike, anything on the comm channels?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not yet, Captain.&quot; A small dragon sighs. &quot;We&#039;re in a completely dead system, near as I can tell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were away from the bridge for a rather long time,&quot; Rarity comments. &quot;What kept you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, well... Fluttershy and Sweetie had a very interesting experiment going on down in the labs. Apparently they were attempting to standardize healing songspells.&quot; Twilight coughs. &quot;I may have gotten a bit carried away talking magic with the doctor. Sweetie tried to keep up, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">The commander chuckles and shakes her head. &quot;You really must keep a lid on those impulses or you&#039;ll drive our poor consular mad!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t help it! It&#039;s practical magic in a sci-fi setting, do you know how hard it is for me to study that kind of thing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow leans over the banister. &quot;I would have thought you&#039;d be more interested in the machines that Apple Bloom&#039;s whipping up down in engineering.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gives her security officer a worried look. &quot;She&#039;s experimenting that close to the warp core?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, the chief engineer is keeping an eye on her. I don&#039;t think AJ would let Bloom do anything <i>too</i> dangerous.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain?&quot; interupts a voice.</p><p class="double">The unicorn turns to her science officer. &quot;Yes Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You may want to see this...&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;An object is approaching us at high warp velocity, warp 9.8... no, it&#039;s slowing down, decelerating to rendezvous it looks like. I wonder if they want to be friends?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s hope so, but just in case... Leiutenant Dash, bring up our shields and go to yellow alert. Passive tracking solution only. Helm, slow to sub-light and be ready for evasion pattern Perseus One.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shields, yellow alert aye aye!&quot; Rainbow tapped the two holo-panels positioned within easy wingtip reach, and an alert sound started hooting.</p><p class="double">The object on their main screen expanded into a sphere and matched their velocity with trivial ease, then expanded into a checker patterned wall. Scootaloo slowed the Ponydrive and brought her round to skim the surface to avoid crashing into it. &quot;Smartly done, Ensign! Bring us to a halt at 10000 klicks from it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain! The object has expanded over one tenth of a lightyear in every direction almost instantly. My sensors can&#039;t read the material or forcefield type. At least the pattern&#039;s pretty.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s also familiar...&quot; Twilight sighed. There was a flash, and Discord appeared in front of the main screen, wearing a zoot suit, big sunglasses and a pimp cane.</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings! I am Q, Q to my friends, but you can call me Q.&quot; He raised the glasses and stage whispered, &quot;It&#039;s actually me, Discord!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, really? Your cunning disguise totally fooled all of us.&quot; Twilight replied deadpan. &quot;So this is your basic &#039;Alien super-being with time on his manipulative appendages decides to test the puny mortals?&#039; I assume?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Discord nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well.&quot; Twilight said. &quot;All hands prepare for Ponyfleet scenario 5C.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>31.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight shelved a book quietly. &quot;You know it has to happen sometime. She&#039;ll know something is up if you don&#039;t show up when you should.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think I&#039;m ready for this. Actually, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m ready to do anything this loop, I&#039;m just going to hide out in Macintosh&#039;s bar.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s not actually Awake,&quot; the librarian pointed out with a small smile. &quot;So the bar doesn&#039;t actually exist.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...does it have to be now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not right now. But... sometime this loop, you really should talk to her.&quot; After a moment, the unicorn smiled. &quot;Celestia is awake this loop too, you know. And, after your conversation with her--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, I know, she&#039;s... not <i>her.</i>&quot; After a moment, the black pegasus let her wings droop. &quot;Alright, alright. But... you have to be there too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fair enough.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia of the Sun sipped her tea, letting her gaze drift to the pink pony on her left.</p><p class="double">Princess Mi Amore Cadenza sipped her tea, examining the diplomat across from her.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, Magic&#039;s exalt, sipped her tea and glanced toward the diplomat sympathetically.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis, Queen of the Changeling Swarm, held the teacup in her magic nervously as she sipped, unable to look at any of them.</p><p class="double">Cadance put her cup down gently. &quot;A peace accord. Based on public integration of Changelings.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...yes. That is, well, why I approached Equestria. Diplomatically.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia and Twilight said nothing, waiting for one of the other two to make the first move.</p><p class="double">Eventually the pink alicorn sighed. &quot;You&#039;re looping, aren&#039;t you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis wilted even further. &quot;...yes. I... I just want to say, I&#039;m sorry and.... and really, that about covers everything I could say.&quot; She cringed. &quot;I can understand if you hate me--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look. The invasion, baseline... yeah, it left an impact on me.&quot; Cadance shrugged. &quot;But I&#039;ve had literally thousands of loops to deal with all that emotional baggage, and so long as you don&#039;t do it again--which you&#039;re probably not going to do, seeing as you&#039;re negotiating for peace--I&#039;m perfectly willing to extend the olive branch.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen&#039;s ears perked. Twilight relaxed.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, Chrysy--can I call you Chrysy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;.&quot; Chrysalis took a breath. &quot;Ah.... I... honestly prefer you wouldn&#039;t.&quot; For some reason she was flushing furiously.</p><p class="double">&quot;...oooookay.&quot; Cadance tapped her hoof for a moment. &quot;...Anyway, how long have you been looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um.... maybe... five loops?&quot; Chrysalis nodded. &quot;Yes. Five.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. By her count there had been six loops so far for the changeling queen, but she was quick enough to recognize exactly what Chrysalis was dancing around.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Well, I hope the loops so far have been, you know, kind to you.&quot; Cadance smiled. &quot;If there&#039;s anything I can do to help your transition--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That really won&#039;t be necessary! I&#039;m coping.&quot; Chrysalis smiled, trying to meet Cadence&#039;s eyes. &quot;Princess Twilight and her friends are helping me.&quot;</p><p class="double">An eyebrow was slowly raised. &quot;<i>Princess</i> Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah....&quot; Chrysalis coughed. &quot;She... can be a princess. It&#039;s a formality, really, if you think I should drop it I can.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I&#039;m fine with it, I was just curious...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s rather understandable,&quot; Celestia pointed out, &quot;given that Twilight had to overthrow me in Chrysalis&#039;s first loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm, yes. Apparently that version of me practiced slavery--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess!&quot; Twilight snapped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I understand that you were very shaken by--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait.&quot; Cadance blinked. &quot;Are you... You were <i>awake?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence slammed down at the alicorn&#039;s shout, the queen of changelings curling up in her chair as the princess of love panted, her hooves against the table. The reigning diarch stood from her chair; her student had buried her face in her forehooves.</p><p class="double">Cadance took a deep breath.</p><p class="double">She let it out.</p><p class="double">She took another breath, sitting back down. Slowly, Celestia retook her own seat, though her eyes never left the other alicorn.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Cadance composed herself. &quot;So. You were... awake for that loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked up, briefly. Twilight reached out and patted her shoulder.</p><p class="double">&quot;...yes. I...&quot; The changeling gulped. &quot;I... thought the whole, baseline loop was... a bad dream.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Cadance sighed and shook her head. &quot;Alright. Okay, I... I can see where you&#039;d be coming from. And I can&#039;t really blame you for Shining, there, that..... I just... argh.&quot; She rubbed her temples, her eyes screwed tightly. &quot;Did you know how I felt? Every time I looked at you two, I remembered the baseline and.... and I had to remind myself constantly that wasn&#039;t what was going on, that you hadn&#039;t actually stolen him--&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia looked between them, somewhat confused. &quot;Wait, what are you two talking about?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;In... that loop, Shining wasn&#039;t awake, he helped Chrysalis run an underground railroad... they fell in love...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I did sense those emotions from you,&quot; Chrysalis explained awkwardly. &quot;I... just thought it was a natural thing. You know, Alicorn of love, I eat love... I was actually very impressed with how you repressed your bigotry.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Except it wasn&#039;t bigotry, was it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not... well, maybe a little. But not really.&quot; Cadance sighed. &quot;Resentment, more like... and I could see you two were genuinely in love and... Ugh. This is just... Look, can we start over here? I don&#039;t, well... I&#039;m not sure how to feel about this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia brought her hoof to her forehead gently. &quot;Twilight... why didn&#039;t you mention this before?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It kind of ties in to why I never mentioned that loop at all,&quot; the unicorn offered, rubbing the back of her head. &quot;I mean, this whole situation is weird...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You really don&#039;t know how to feel, do you?&quot; Chrysalis tilted her head. &quot;There&#039;s flashes of anger and pity and... I... Um. Sure. Starting over sounds good...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, very good. So! I&#039;m Cadance, and... it&#039;s nice to meet you, I guess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Chrysalis and... I... am happy that you&#039;re happy to meet me...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia took a breath. &quot;Well, at least this ended up being peaceful enough. Maybe we should arrange for Shining Armor to--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; Chrysalis cried. &quot;No. I am not... <i>nearly</i> ready enough to handle that. No. Can we not tell him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess,&quot; Twilight replied with a shrug. &quot;He&#039;s not Awake anyway...&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen perked her ears. &quot;He... isn&#039;t?&quot; She turned to Cadance with an awkward smile. &quot;Um, would you mind terribly if--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re dating,&quot; the alicorn replied flatly.</p><p class="double">&quot;...ah. Oh, um. Okay...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance let out an annoyed grumble. &quot;This would be so much easier if I could actually hate you...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So... that went well!&quot; Twilight chirped brightly. &quot;I mean, all things considered.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis gave her a long, flat look.</p><p class="double">Then, after a moment, green flames burst up around her and she smiled. &quot;I&#039;ll go give Macintosh your love.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What--&quot; The unicorn blinked as she rushed out of the library. &quot;Chrysalis!&quot; Twilight ran after her double, trying to catch her before she made the loop more embaressing then it was, but already Chrysalis was nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um, Twilight?&quot; Fluttershy walked up timidly. &quot;Hello. What is, um, how are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quick, Shy, did you see me run through here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Well yes. Chrysalis went that way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, you&#039;re the--Wait, Shy&#039;s not awake this loop.&quot; Twilight turned to her friend and raised an eyebrow. &quot;Haha, very funny. You got me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy rolled her eyes and burst into flames, turning into a black pegasus. &quot;You&#039;re really too smart for your own good, Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, in all seriousness... it could have gone a lot worse.&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;I think this is good though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That whole thing was incredibly awkward.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not nearly as awkward as the time I killed Cadance and married Shining. Man, when she got back from the dead things were weird...&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. &quot;I... <i>what?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and snorted. &quot;Okay, so my preawake self was basically a sociopath in that loop, and the local Pinkie Pie somehow managed to bake a portal to the afterlife--no, I don&#039;t understand it either...&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>31.4 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Academic Excellence - Epilogue</u></p><p class="double">Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash entered the Commandants office to find Spitfire already there. The two of them had rested up (much to Pinkie Pie&#039;s disappointment until Twilight reminded her that they still had the party to set up for later) and had received orders to report as soon as they&#039;d recovered. The yellow pegasus looked at them over her glasses as they came to attention in front of her.</p><p class="double">“Well. I have to say, when you bust clouds, you don&#039;t do half a job! You will be pleased to know that your entire group will be receiving commendations on their records, and the Silver Bolt, for actions above and beyond the call of duty.”</p><p class="double">The two pegasi couldn&#039;t help cracking at least a small grin. It wasn&#039;t the highest award the Wonderbolts could bestow, but it was respectable. Full fledged Wonderbolts had gone through their careers without getting it, and the number of cadets that had received it could be counted on one hoof, without the hoof.</p><p class="double">“However, the two of you require special attention. As the highest scoring wing pair in the group, you were its de-facto leaders, and that&#039;s borne out by my interviews with the other cadets. They followed your lead on this. That&#039;s why I&#039;m trying to decide whether to have you commended to the Princesses for bravery, or to kick you off the cloud for doing something so reckless!”</p><p class="double">The sudden change in tone caught both of them by surprise.</p><p class="double">“The Wonderbolts have their own records which I&#039;ve studied since we returned. The last time a Tempest emerged from the Everfree Forest, it was driven off from an attack on Cloudsdale, not destroyed, and doing so required the combined efforts of the Wonderbolts and the Cloudsdale Royal Guard contingent. Not without casualties either.</p><p class="double">“Cadet Dash, you apparently knew about this thing&#039;s capabilities. What in Equestria possessed you to attack it, and risk yourself and the other cadets?”</p><p class="double">“Ma&#039;am, we didn&#039;t start out intending to attack it. We received the distress call from Twilight, and set out to rescue her balloon. I explained what I knew, and all the other cadets agreed to the risk. But the initial plan was purely to distract it, play keep away to distract it while we got the balloon out of there then disengage.”</p><p class="double">“All the same, you put the other cadets in considerable danger.” Spitfire said sternly.</p><p class="double">“Permission to speak ma&#039;am!” Lightning Dust piped up.</p><p class="double">“Yes cadet?”</p><p class="double">“The information may have come from Dash, and the plan was developed by all of our group working together, but Dash looked to me for the final say go ahead. I&#039;m the Lead pony of the leading wing pair, which means it was my call. I gave the okay, so if there&#039;s trouble coming, it&#039;s my responsibility, not Dash&#039;s.”</p><p class="double">Dash couldn&#039;t help but look side-long at her lead in surprise. Then she felt bad for being surprised . Lightning Dust might have flaws, but lack of courage wasn&#039;t one of them. She wouldn&#039;t leave her friend hanging. “But it was my advice you followed. We went into that storm cloud together, you&#039;re not going into this one alone.”</p><p class="double">“Attention!” The two snapped back to attention to look forward at Spitfire., who took her sun glasses off and folded them deliberately.</p><p class="double">“Much as I enjoy watching the two of you play the reverse blame game, I will decide who is responsible for what, and what should be done about it. Rescuing civilians, I don&#039;t have a problem with. But you still have to explain why once they were out of danger, you didn&#039;t disengage. You correctly alerted the Officer on Deck, you must have known we we&#039;d scramble everything we had to come support you.”</p><p class="double">The two ponies glanced at each other, and Lightning Dust gave a slight nod, which Dash took to be a sign to take the question. “It was firing bolts of lightning ma&#039;am, not just short bursts but long streaks that homed in, but it could only track so fast. Close in, we could evade them, but if we&#039;d increased the range, we or one of the other wing pairs would have gotten hit.</p><p class="double">“We were trapped. That was my fault, I didn&#039;t know it could do that, but having seen it up close, sensed how the weather magic inside it held it together, I realised a large enough burst of weather magic to it&#039;s core could break it apart. But it took both of us to deliver enough energy to finish the job. I know it wasn&#039;t a good option, but at that point we didn&#039;t <i>have</i> any good options. At the very least, the disruption would have allowed the other wing pairs to get clear.”</p><p class="double">“And you agreed to this plan?” Spitfire looked over at Lightning Dust.</p><p class="double">“Yes ma&#039;am! Rainbow Dash is a skilled weather pony, and the only pony in Equestria able to do a Sonic Rainboom...”</p><p class="double">“Not any more.” Dash whispered, then shut up at a quelling glare from Spitfire.</p><p class="double">“... more than that, I trust her judgement. If she believed it had a good chance of success, I wasn&#039;t going to disagree. In truth she deserves to be Lead pony far more than I do. The entire group from Ponyville already works together like a Wonderbolt team, has blown away every group record they&#039;ve gone up against and she&#039;s never been anything less than supportive of any of them.</p><p class="double">“She even managed to get me turned around. I was heading for a bad place, but she never gave up on me, no matter what I did. She might risk herself, but she would never risk her team mates, or ask them to do anything she wouldn&#039;t do herself. With respect ma&#039;am, she showed me what being a Wonderbolt actually means, and if we do get kicked off the cloud, I can think of no finer company to be in as we fall.”</p><p class="double">Spitfire stared at them both for a long moment, then heaved a big sigh. “Very well, if that is your decision... Lightning Dust!”</p><p class="double">“Yes ma&#039;am!” The green pegasus straightened up waiting for the thunderbolt to hit.</p><p class="double">“As Lead pony of your cadet group, you will be awarded the Golden Bolt for Valour and you will be commended to the Princesses. If I don&#039;t get you a Monarchs Thanks out of it, I&#039;ll go back to crop-dusting. Not just for dealing with the Tempest either. A true leader takes responsibility, and in your defence of Rainbow Dash you showed moral courage to equal your demonstrated physical bravery. You are also promoted to the rank of Cadet Leader.”</p><p class="double">That rank was only ever given to cadets who came back for advanced training, and then only to a senior cadet who was in charge of a junior group. She broke into a wide grin at the thunderstruck expression on Lightning Dust&#039;s face. “However, if you ever pull a stunt like that again without orders I will pin your wings back so far you can clean your pinions with your tail! Do you read me Cadet Leader?”</p><p class="double">“Ma&#039;am, yes ma&#039;am!” Lightning Dust saluted so hard, she almost brained herself with her hoof. She glanced at Dash to see how she was taking it and saw only a wide grin as the rainbow pegasus reverse punched the air.</p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash, the position of Cadet Leader is already taken, however, I intend to see you wearing a Golden Bolt, though my sources tell me I don&#039;t need to commend you to the princesses. I do however have a position in mind, Assistant instructor Dash, if you&#039;re willing to accept it.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s wings almost lifted her off the ground. “Woo hoo... I mean, ma&#039;am yes ma&#039;am! I do ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">Spitfire polished a lens against her lapel and put her glasses back on. “Considering the job you&#039;ve done up till now, I figured why not make it official? Now, I believe you have a party to go to. Dismissed!”</p><p class="double">The two of them saluted again, and filed out. Dash hesitated in the door for a moment, looking back at the seated pony, silhouetted by the setting sun coming through the windows behind her.</p><p class="double">“Um... ma&#039;am?”</p><p class="double">“What is it Rainbow Dash?” Spitfire&#039;s response was short, but not unkind.</p><p class="double">“Would you like to join us? When you come off duty that is. There&#039;s going to be plenty of food for every-pony, and Applejack&#039;s only gotten better at baking since the Gala.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was as easy to read as a Wonderbolts promotional poster and for that Spitfire was glad. This wasn&#039;t an attempt to curry favour, though what more could she want? It was nothing more than a genuine offer for Spitfire to come and enjoy herself.</p><p class="double">“I have a lot of paperwork to do... but I&#039;ll make my way over as soon as it&#039;s finished.” She pulled the first report from a stack, running the Academy wasn&#039;t all hoof-printing autograph pictures, and sighed. “Thank the Princesses I&#039;m rotating back to operational duty next month. The paperwork only ever seems to stack higher.”</p><p class="double">“I hear you ma&#039;am. Cloud use reports, thunderstorm health and safety assessments, an earth pony could haul the water to Cloudsdale just by stacking up the weather patrol paperwork and climbing it.”</p><p class="double">“Go on!” Spitfire waved her away. “Go have fun, you&#039;ve earned it. Maybe when I get there you can show me how to do that Sonic Rainboom of yours. This chassis may not be the latest model, but I can still buck the blue with the best of them. And maybe this old pony can teach the two of you some new tricks.”</p><p class="double">“Ma&#039;am yes ma&#039;am!” With that Rainbow Dash closed the door behind her.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">The party had run well in to the twilight, and Twilight was well into running the party. Firefly tiki torches were scattered around the cloud it was being held on, and the Pinkie/Applejack buffet was being done great justice by the assembled ponies. Pinkie herself was part of the group playing cloud volleyball over to one side and a number of other ponies were just chilling with drinks and listening to a Victrola which was pumping out &#039;Good Striations&#039; by the Cumulus Colts. </p><p class="double">(Yes, it is your typical surfer beach party.)</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust and Rainbow dash were at the centre of this group, at least until they saw Spitfire approaching. Rainbow Dash greeted her with a grin and a wide wave of her wing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome to the party!&quot;</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust was a little more thoughtful. &quot;Uh ma&#039;am? Permission to speak freely?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spitfire gave a grin of her own. &quot;We&#039;re off the clock, so you can cut down the ma&#039;aming to a minimum &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The meeting, the whole getting kicked out, was it all a test?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Life is a test, and there&#039;s no retakes.&quot; </p><p class="double">Spitfire thought she heard a muffled snort from Rainbow Dash, and wondered what was so funny.</p><p class="double">She continued. &quot;In short, yes and no. I needed to understand not just what you did, but why. I knew you had courage, but did it make you reckless? In a regular Wonderbolt, a willingness to take risks isn&#039;t necessarily a flaw, if they&#039;re able to follow the chain of command, harness it to the overall plan, but a leader has to have something more. the ability to assess the risks, make the decisions as to whether they&#039;re worthwhile, balance the needs of the team with the needs of the mission, and put both ahead of their own needs.&quot;</p><p class="double">She tapped the younger pegasus on the chest. &quot;You demonstrated just that in the way you responded when I made the meeting adversarial. You got the good stuff because you exceeded my expectations once again. You&#039;re going to make one heck of a Wonderbolt, and that goes for you too, you grinning maverick!&quot;</p><p class="double">The last was addressed to the smirking Rainbow Dash. &quot;Okay, now if Soarin hasn&#039;t finished them off, I&#039;d like to get some of those pies, and then we&#039;ll see if I can buck out a Sonic Rainboom.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;So, um, Mom...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled to herself, still feeling her heart warm up a bit even after all these years. Then she turned around. &quot;Yes Nyx?&quot;</p><p class="double">The young black alicorn shuffled her hoof around in a slow circle. &quot;You know how, um... in my original loop, there was the whole Cult of Nightmare thing?&quot;</p><p class="double">The scholar nodded, wondering exactly where this was going.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... I just found out there&#039;s a <i>small</i> cult here too... but, um...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....but?&quot; Twilight prompted gently.</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re not... exactly... competent. Or sane, actually.&quot; Nyx shrugged. &quot;They&#039;ve got a clown, two other ponies... I&#039;m pretty sure one of them is a stoner, but I can&#039;t figure out which one. Oh, and their leader does manage the whole Evil Minion thing. That&#039;s actually all he does.&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian blinked. After a moment she nodded once. &quot;Okay, so you have some... strange fans. It&#039;s happened to all of us, Nyx, and if you ever need to talk about it--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, um...&quot; The reborn incarnation of Nightmare Moon, Embodiment of Eternal Night and Tyrant Usurper, let her eyes fall to the ground awkwardly. &quot;I kinda... sorta... maybe invited them over for dinner tonight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They were genuflecting! I panicked!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Spike shared a look as the pie dripped slowly down the librarian&#039;s mane.</p><p class="double">It had turned out that Nyx had missed two members of the cult, resulting in a mad kitchen scramble to redistribute the portions while Twilight got to know her daughter&#039;s... stalkers, to be totally honest. Clippy Clop the clown was apparently mute, but made up for it with humorous japery... of which Twilight was a victim. He was probably only in the cult because of Screwball, who had ended up being the town fool in this loop instead of Diamond Tiara&#039;s mad sister... or mother.... or Discord&#039;s daughter, thank Celestia the chaos god wasn&#039;t awake <i>that</i> loop.</p><p class="double">A yellow stallion sighed and levitated the pipan off their host. &quot;I&#039;m... sorry about him, he takes his job seriously.&quot; He smiled apologetically, further cementing his status in her mind as the sane member of this group.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s fine mister Cosmic.&quot; Twilight shook her head, dislodging some of the cream as she levitated a towel out of the kitchen. &quot;I&#039;ve had worse, and I&#039;m sure mister Clop was only expressing his appreciation for my delicate care of your deity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed, bro, that&#039;s an awesome thing you&#039;re doing. Awesome like the wave I totes saw in my cereal this morning.&quot; The white pegasus mare stretched her wings. &quot;Like... whoa..&quot;</p><p class="double">Apparently Sunny Daze was an actual pegasus this loop, instead of just an alias, and Twilight couldn&#039;t exactly fault Nyx for thinking she was high; the surfer tone made sense, but the observations she made were rather... unusual. She&#039;d almost blown cover by accidentally calling her princess, but Sunny had assumed that Twilight was just referring to her position as the most radical of Nightmare Moon&#039;s followers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, miss Daze.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa, dude, miss Daze is my <i>mother.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Screwball screwed up her face. &quot;I thought your mother&#039;s name was Whipcurl?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus rolled her eyes. &quot;Totes being metaphor, dudette.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why is she a dudette when I&#039;m a dude?&quot; Twilight asked lightly. &quot;We&#039;re both mares!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa. You&#039;re a dudette?&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian blinked. After a moment, she took a breath and turned to the other pegasus in the room. &quot;So... um... Rocken Coconut. Those are some interesting colors you&#039;ve painted yourself...&quot;</p><p class="double">Coconut preened, brushing a black hoof through his mane and obliviously pulling some of the dried blue paint out of its blonde strands. &quot;Thank you. I felt it was only natural for me to emulate the Goddess&#039;s form. Of course I&#039;d never wear my horn in public, that would be blasphemous.&quot; Clippy Clop honked solemnly.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded slowly. &quot;That... makes sense.&quot; After a moment, she took a breath and turned to the final stallion. &quot;You&#039;ve been very quiet, mister...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tiiiiireeeeeeeeek.&quot; The whispered growl emerged slowly from the dark shadows of the hood. &quot;Bringer of tooooooormeeeent and looooooooyal servitor to her high empressssssss. I see no reeeeeeeessssson to speak to you.&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian rolled her eyes. &quot;Whatever you say. If you&#039;ll excuse me, I need to check on dinner....&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.6</p><p class="double">“Look, Dash,” Gilda said, “I don’t get why you’re so uptight about this. You were never this boring in Flight School.”</p><p class="double">Dash winced internally. It was tough, dealing with Gilda. Half the time she was reminding Dash of how much they’d been friends, and the other half the time she was being kind of a jerk.</p><p class="double">Yes, Dash could engineer a reconciliation or at least a less firey breakup, and stay in touch. But doing it over and over again got kind of wearying after a while.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy’s my friend, too, Gils,” Dash replied. “I mean, she’s… yeah, different, but…”</p><p class="double">“Heh.” Gilda looked down. “Different, yeah. Hey, watch this!”</p><p class="double">“Wait-” Dash was speaking to an empty cloud.</p><p><hr></p><p>Gilda landed just around the corner from where Fluttershy was, then walked out acting oblivious. It didn’t take long for the two of them to bump into one another.</p><p class="double">“Oi!” Gilda shouted, and roared at Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">The great noise sent ponies all around the area scurrying for cover.</p><p class="double">When it ended, Fluttershy cocked her head. “Are we having a roaring contest?” she asked, politely.</p><p class="double">“…eh?” The griffin blinked.</p><p class="double">“My turn.”</p><p class="double">Abruptly, there was a large wolf standing there instead. It threw back its neck, and howled to the sky at the top of its lungs. It went on, and on, for at least thirty seconds.</p><p class="double">When done, the wolf looked down, then blushed… somehow. “Oh, sorry…” Fluttershy said, transforming back and rubbing her hooves together, “…that wasn’t a roar, was it? I suppose you win…”</p><p class="double">Gilda breathed deeply, forcing her raised hackles to go down. Once she had them under control, she preened her wings a bit, then dropped the task until later. “What the buck just happened?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy just looked down and shuffled her hooves.</p><p class="double">For her part, Gilda looked conflicted. “…I mean, I didn’t imagine that, right? You just turned into a wolf?”</p><p class="double">“…yes…”</p><p class="double">“You know…” Gilda’s expression firmed. “That was actually pretty cool.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Some of the strength came back into Fluttershy’s voice.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.”</p><p><hr></p><p>From her cloud, Dash thought over how to take that.</p><p class="double">Apparently griffins <i>did</i> respect strength. Cool.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.7</p><p class="double">“Basically,” Twilight said, looking at Chrysalis over a pair of spectacles, “I think it would help you to move on a bit.”</p><p class="double">The Changeling Queen looked less than convinced. “I don’t know if it would. Or, for that matter, if that would be a good idea in the first place.”</p><p class="double">Then she pointed. “And what’s with the spectacles, anyway?”</p><p class="double">“I dunno,” Twilight replied, shrugging. “I found them in the library once, and they seemed to be a good thing to keep around. I’m thinking of getting them rose tinted. But back to my point. You can’t just pine over Shining forever – that’s not fair to yourself, it’s not fair to him, and it’s not fair to Cadence either.”</p><p class="double">“I know it isn’t,” Chrysalis replied. “But he’s still… he <i>was</i> still… my first real <i>love</i>. Up to then, love wasn’t something I fully understood, I think. It wasn’t the way the hive works – that’s an intense affection, but it’s like… a limb. Or something. You’re just so used to it being there that you have to take a step back to notice it. But Shining… it was something I <i>wasn’t</i> used to, and it was… wonderful.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I see. And I do have sympathy for you – the way you put it sounds a lot like how I first got friends. But… you don’t need to have just one love. Ponies move on from their first loves, and it doesn’t make the second any less sweet.”</p><p class="double">“And you’d know?” Chrysalis challenged.</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Twilight replied. “Not directly. But I’ve paid attention to how all this works.”</p><p class="double">After a moment, she pulled a scrapbook from her subspace pocket and turned to a double-page spread, full of photographs. “See this human?”</p><p class="double">“Yes…” Chrysalis replied, confused by the non-sequitur.</p><p class="double">“His name is Bran. I Looped here once, and… oh, never mind, it’d take too long to explain. But Bran’s a werewolf, one of several there. That’s his second wife.”</p><p class="double">“And he loves her?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked at her in astonishment.</p><p class="double">“He lost his first wife, and it hurt too much, so he deliberately picked as his second mate – and wife – someone who was too petty, too judgemental, to become part of his heart.” Twilight closed the scrapbook again. “That’s an option, too, but I really think you’re not the sort of pony to take it.”</p><p class="double">After a long minute of thought, the changeling nodded slowly.</p><p class="double">“On a completely different tack, though, you don’t <i>need</i> to find a special somepony straight away if you <i>do</i> decide to follow my advice. In fact, I’d advise against it.” Twilight shrugged. “Spike and Rarity are an extreme case – they spent over a hundred years getting to know one another again before they made it official – but the idea is sound. Don’t commit too soon, at least if you’re going to do more than what Bran did.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, then.” Chrysalis nodded to herself. “I’ll give it a go.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“So…” the disguised Changeling said awkwardly, shifting on the chair as her pegasus’ wings tried to flare in nervousness. “What do you do, then?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I give self help seminars, actually,” Iron Will replied, pouring them both drinks. “All about being tough and courageous. Very gryphonic philosophy, in a way.”</p><p class="double">“That’s interesting…” Chrysalis said, and then nearly got bowled over by a sudden rush of vehement, forthright emotion.</p><p class="double">“Don’t be half hearted! If someone’s being square, give them a nasty stare!”</p><p class="double"><i>Somehow,</i> Chrysalis thought, <i>this isn’t going to work out.</i></p><p><hr></p><p>31.8</p><p class="double">Twilight felt the Loop settling into place around her in a familiar way. Canterlot, just found out about Nightmare Moon, all that jazz.</p><p class="double">“Okay, Spike, take a-”…</p><p class="double">Something was wrong.</p><p class="double">“I… think you might have confused me with someone else,” a decidedly <i>female</i> voice said from behind her.</p><p class="double">Twilight scanned through her loop memories as she turned to the speaker. As it happened, she was a <i>blue</i> baby dragon.</p><p class="double">“…oh, hold on,” Twilight said, interested. “Are you a new Looper?”</p><p class="double">“Well, new to here. Hi, I’m-”</p><p class="double">“Saphira, yes,” Twilight nodded. The dragon seemed slightly surprised, and Twilight tossed her mane. “Loop memories tend to support a self-consistent reality, and since you’re taking the place of my assistant, Spike… that means I know your name.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, of course.” Saphira nodded. “I’m sorry, we’re not very used to fused loops. I think this is only the third or the fourth…”</p><p class="double">“Right. Oh, are you the Anchor?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Saphira paused. “Well, mostly no. My bonded human is, and we have a fairly close empathic bond, so we’re hardly ever <i>not</i> both Looping.”</p><p class="double">“Interesting…” Twilight dashed off a note with magic while she spoke. “Well, we’ll see how the first few days of the Loop go, and see if your Anchor is around.”</p><p class="double">Saphira held up a hand-paw. “No need, my link just started working. He’s here. And apparently a… lacemaker. Well, at least he’s good at that.” The little dragon carefully hid a good-natured chuckle.</p><p class="double">“…well, that answers the question of who <i>he’s</i> replacing,” Twilight said.</p><p><hr></p><p>The anchor in question, Eragon, sank back onto a couch in the library. Saphira walked over and sat next to him, and they exchanged a fond look before turning to Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Basically, where we come from, there’s this huge empire, then some elves, and rebels.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“My Loop starts right about when the elves try to send a dragon egg –“</p><p class="double">“That’s me,” Saphira said.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that’s Saphira, to someone who works for the rebels.” Eragon looked at Twilight with a sardonic expression. “I’m simplifying just a bit, in case you couldn’t tell. Anyway, I pick it up, then miss Blue Scales here hatches out and things get a bit… complicated.”</p><p class="double">“Complicated meaning,” Saphira said with a tart smile, “he and I become the single most valuable bargaining chip in Alagaesia. Dragon riders were the old rulers where we come from, so old Slow Feet here and I are champions and legitimizers all rolled into one – and it didn’t help that we were both breathtakingly naïve, politically, the first time. Add to <i>that</i> that I’m the only female dragon that entire world knows exists, and…”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced.</p><p class="double">“So, long story short, we’re looking forward to a loop as quiet as we can get.”</p><p class="double">“Right…” Twilight nodded. “Good news for you there, actually. Princess Celestia and Princess Luna declared Equestria’s Loop to be a sanctuary. You can have your quiet loop.” Then she paused. “By the way… what’s with the lace?”</p><p class="double">Eragon shot a glance at Saphira, who held up her hand-paws. “Guilty, guilty, I accept full responsibility.”</p><p class="double">“You’ll pay for that,” he warned, and she grinned. “Anyway, it’s actually how we fund the Varden – that’s the rebel group. Magic is costly of energy, more costly than doing the same thing by non-magical means, but it’s perfect for finicky detail work.”</p><p class="double">“So you work for the rebels?”</p><p class="double">“Sometimes.” He stretched his forelegs out on the couch. “Sometimes I try the Empire, sometimes the Elves, sometimes I go my own way. It’s a right bear trying to make my world actually work out.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Well…” Spike said, looking down. “I didn’t expect this.”</p><p class="double">The alabaster dragon about the size of a small cat gave a wing-flipping shrug in response.</p><p class="double">“Hey, join the club,” Hiccup said. “I get about one loop in fifty where I’m the dragon, these days.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Spike snapped his fingers, summoning his lightsaber. “Well, I might need <i>this</i>… anyway, where’s Toothless?”</p><p class="double">“Officially, he’s dead. Unofficially…” Hiccup opened his jacket, revealing a six-inch fire lizard hanging from the inner lining.</p><p class="double"><i>Hey,</i> Toothless broadcast on a broad band. <i>You wanna buy a dragon?</i> </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.9 (misterQ)</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I reckon I do,&quot; said a despondent looking Applejack. She looked over at Twilight Sparkle, only to see that her friend was already in therapist mode. Every pony who was awake this loop decided to take this round off and go on vacation. Celestia was teaching her sister and Nyx how to surf. Most of her friends were enjoying themselves on the beach, along with Derpy and her daughters - who Applejack remembered should have also been in Ponyville at the same time. Of course, she remembered having seen Derpy at the young flyer&#039;s competition in three different places at the same time. Applejack just silently filed this fact away in her mental vault along with the memories of all of the non-euclidean mind-warping things she had encountered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why don&#039;t you start at the beginning of that loop, Applejack,&quot; Twilight said as she sat in her beach chair, &quot;I assume you mean the one where Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and myself went off to help a non-looping Spike with his dragon curiosity issues?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, that&#039;s the one,&quot; Applejack sipped from her large mug of cider and wondered if she&#039;d need anything stronger to tell the tale, &quot;I mean, things started off like they all happened originally. Then Princess Celestia called on me and Pinkie and Trixie, of all ponies, to help her deal with an issue.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is strange she would call on Trixie…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Princess told us it was because we needed a unicorn, and you and Rarity were gone at the time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight contemplated that for a short while, &quot;Still, it seems odd that she would need Pinkie and Trixie, of all ponies, to accompany you on what was supposed to be a diplomatic mission.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed, &quot;That&#039;s because I reckon our princess has days where she done dumps a bunch of fuel on the fire to see how big the flames are going to get. And that&#039;s all fine and good unless the flames are suddenly consuming all the rational parts of my mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight sighed. She was very, very well antiquated with the mischievous side of Celestia. She looked over to see the grinning sun princess telekinetically pulled the surfboard out from under Luna, plunging her sister into the water and chastising her about keeping her balance, &quot;So.... seaponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack gave a small shudder and acknowledged, &quot;Yup. Seaponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">The was a long silence as the orange earth pony took a long sip of her cider, &quot;The first thing you gotta know about seaponies and mermares is that they&#039;re all insane. All the ponies under the water are completely crazy. Pinkie Pie said that they&#039;ve been battling undersea horrors for so long, they&#039;re on their last sanity point; whatever that means.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Pinkie was sent with you on a diplomatic mission to Aquastria?&quot; Twilight blinked, astounded, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">In answer, Applejack just pointed her hoof at the epic water fight erupting between the two alicorn sisters. Then she continued, &quot;Although it may be because Pinkie was the closest to their way of thinking. Anyways, Trixie cast the &#039;don&#039;t drown and die&#039;, or whatever it&#039;s called, spell on all of us and down we went.&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony took another sip from her mug, remembering, &quot;Do you know why King Leo is a seal?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sea Lion,&quot; Twilight Sparkle corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seal, sea lion; what&#039;s the difference?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Longer whiskers, longer flippers, and ear flaps to start with. Seals only have little ear holes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ear flaps? Seriously?&quot; Applejack sighed, &quot;Anyways, do you know why King Leo isn&#039;t a seapony? It&#039;s because someone rational has to be able to keep them all from blowing everything up or setting everything on fire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her mouth, but Applejack interrupted, &quot;And yes, I know that they live underwater. But trust me on this. Setting themselves and everything else on fire is a very real danger with unmonitored seaponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn debated with herself before asking, &quot;How?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The first thing you got to realize is that seaponies are all water-benders. For a people with no real limbs and only a tail, they are scary powerful. You&#039;d think you&#039;d be safe on land, but I&#039;ve seen them create water spheres around them and roll right on after their enemies. Then they can create water tendrils that can happily rip apart a lava demon and beat them to death with their own severed body parts while the seaponies all laugh and sing and harmonize.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That all actually happened, by the way,&quot; Applejack clarified, &quot;While the mermares and the seastallions had their annual no-holds-barred race, some lava demons all done decided to attack. The reason the actual seapony leader who - doesn&#039;t like ruling, and thank the herd for that; Queen Marina called for Equestrian help was to try to convince King Leo to open up their strategic reserves of both explosives and cheerleading outfits to fight the encroaching forces of the Squirk, the Kraken King.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheerleading outfits?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t rightly know. Only that it mightily disturbed King Leo to see Pinkie Pie when she found one. Then he called her over and whispered something to her about Squirk, and she quickly got out of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. see,&quot; And Twilight really, really wished she didn&#039;t; so she changed the subject, &quot;I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever met this Queen Marina.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s usually on the front lines, fighting them undersea monstrosities that Pinkie talked about. Elegant mermare, pretty tail and fins, but she gets a really scary grin on her face when she&#039;s all talking about explosives. She and Trixie got on like apples and more apples.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When Pinkie and I got back from baking our contribution to the victory feast, Pinkie latched on to the conversation about things that go all boom,&quot; Applejack finished off her cider in one long sip, &quot;They started resonating crazy, Twilight. The three of them, Trixie, Pinkie, and Marina, started scaring me real bad. I pulled them apart when I started hearing phrases like &#039;willy pete fiendfyre variant&#039;, &#039;everything explodes forever&#039;, and &#039;how difficult would it be to summon a chlorine trifluoride elemental underwater&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Applejack. Just enjoy this vacation loop, okay?&quot; Twilight gently hugged her distraught friend, &quot;Just do me one favor, alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn smiled, &quot;Don&#039;t go in the water.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack returned the grin, &quot;You don&#039;t have to tell me twice, sugarcube.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>32.1</p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Trixie said, in an urgent whisper. “I have something to show you.”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Twilight asked, looking up.</p><p class="double">“Sssh!” Trixie replied in a strangled tone. “Not so loud!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, you have my attention…” Twilight put her book down, with bookmark, and followed her friend out to Trixie’s wagon slash shed.</p><p class="double">(Trixie insisted it was still a wagon, but Twilight had her own opinions about something which had no wheels and was held down by guy ropes. And which had three extra rooms, including a bathroom and Jacuzzi.)</p><p class="double">Once inside, Trixie pulled up a hatch in the floor and trotted slowly down the steps. Twilight followed, already wondering by what possible means it was still a wagon when it had a basement.</p><p class="double">“In here,” Trixie said, hushed, opening a large metal door which turned out to be four inches thick.</p><p class="double">“What are you <i>doing</i> down here?” Twilight asked, still quietly.</p><p class="double">“Behold,” Trixie said, and made a grand gesture. “My laboratory. I am currently working on the most impressive purely non-magical pyrotechnics I can discover. Mere unavailability of magic will not stop me from making a loop exciting.”</p><p class="double">“And what you’ve created is?” Twilight pressed, with a sinking feeling.</p><p class="double">“Dimercuric tetraazide.”</p><p class="double">There was a pause, as the scholarly Anchor digested that for a moment.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that sounds like the most obscenely touchy explosive I’ve been fortunate enough to never encounter in my long life. Is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well… yes, actually,” Trixie admitted.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Before going any further, Twilight silently cast her brother’s defensive spell on both of them. “So, what did you want to invite me down here to see?”</p><p class="double">“The bit where I decant it, of course,” Trixie replied. “It took eight months to purify enough to make a small supply, and this is a historic moment. I have genuinely discovered something new, here…”</p><p class="double">Twilight strengthened the spell.</p><p class="double">Trixie moved over to the beaker. In slow, reverent, and very careful movements, she lifted it up in both forehooves and tilted it. Liquid dripped out, one carefully metered drop at a time, until some small crystals could be seen.</p><p class="double">Again moving with the utmost care, Trixie placed the beaker back down again. She telekinetically picked up a spatula-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike blinked, as the windows rattled and he saw the Books and Branches shoot into the sky on a trail of fire. “Hey, Rarity?”</p><p class="double">“What?” the fashionista mumbled around her mouthful of pins.</p><p class="double">“I think Trixie just blew up our house again. Can I stay here?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, if you must…”</p><p class="double">They exchanged a wry look.</p><p class="double">“Any excuse is a good excuse,” Spike shrugged. “How’s it going?”</p><p class="double">“I really need to invent a fabric that changes sizes properly,” Rarity finally replied, putting the pins down. “But if you don’t size-shift with it on, those should last you a while.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Trixie would like fries with that,” the blue unicorn muttered, and fell over.</p><p class="double">Twilight dug herself out of the remains of the antechamber. “What the buck just happened?”</p><p class="double">From her position on the floor, Trixie stuck up a hoof. “I know, miss! The compound turned out to be highly reactive to even very dim light in the dry state, so even simple magiluminescence caused a violent explosion.”</p><p class="double">Splinters and bits of wagon, tree and Jacuzzi began to rain down around them.</p><p class="double">“Hi!” Derpy said, flying over the hole. “Letter for you, Twilight. Oh, were you and Trixie doing home renovation? That always happens when I try.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “No… this was more along the lines of an industrial accident.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Derpy nodded and flew off, almost tripping over in the air and hence being missed by Twilight’s still-intact bed as it plummeted into the hole next to them.</p><p class="double">“You know,” Twilight added conversationally, as she opened the letter, “if this explosion blew up the books despite my protective spells there’ll be Tartarus to pay, Trixie… oh, that’s nice. It seems my application to visit the Griffin Lands got approved.”</p><p class="double">Twilight fixed the showmare with a stare. “And my house better be here when I get back. Understand?”</p><p class="double">Trixie had started snoring.</p><p class="double">“Oh, whatever.” Twilight shrugged, then teleported out of the crater where her house used to be and trotted off east.</p><p class="double">Maybe it was time to stage an intervention with that mare…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.2</p><p class="double">Twilight was still unsettled by that “Astrid” pegasus. From what she’d said, it had taken not too long to work out that the foreign Looper was actually one of Hiccup’s friends. (Honestly, the dragon should have been a clue.)</p><p class="double">Indeed, there were those suggestions that she thought rather more of him… though given what she was like, Twilight felt more pity than anything.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” she said, a slight quaver in her voice as Astrid flipped a battleaxe between her wings, “the next thing that normally happens here is that Fluttershy tries to redeem Discord.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>him,”</i> Astrid said, scowling.</p><p class="double">Actually, it had been fascinating to watch her interaction with Discord. He’d turned her into a cringing, zero-confidence weakling who was scared stiff by bad language and had to be rescued out from under her axe.</p><p class="double">In other words, basically into Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">“Think you could give it a go?” Twilight hazarded, and was rewarded with a scowl.</p><p class="double">“Can I, hel! I’ll sort him out.” Astrid’s face set. “Hold on, I need to go get some helpers.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You actually released me?” Discord said, looking around. “How strange.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I’ll handle this,” Astrid said, and strode forward. “Look, goatface. You listen to me, and we’re all happy fun time friends.”</p><p class="double">Discord thought. “Nah. Now-”</p><p class="double">She darted up and took hoof-fulls of his hair and beard, dragging him around to look her in the eyes. “I. Wasn’t. Finished. Now, the easy way is the way I just described. The <i>fun</i> way is that you don’t listen to me.”</p><p class="double">“What happens then?” Discord said, interested.</p><p class="double">Astrid smirked, and beat her rear left hoof on the ground twice.</p><p class="double">An Ursa Major, Stormfly, a chimera and a manticore lumbered into view.</p><p class="double">Notably, the Ursa was carrying an axe the size of the town hall.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Astrid said, catching her own battleaxe as Applejack heaved it over, “in that case then we try what I like to call a trial separation.”</p><p class="double">“Separation of what?” Pinkie asked brightly. “Did you two get married without telling me?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, I was thinking more… head from body.”</p><p class="double">Discord took careful note of the way Astrid was hefting the battleaxe in one wing. Then, slowly and deliberately, he tracked across the manticore (which had a tail in strike position), the chimera (all three of whose heads were snarling), the Deadly Nadder (who was in the middle of taking an ominous breath), and finally stopped on the <i>big</i> axe.</p><p class="double">“What was that bit about listening to you?”</p><p class="double">Astrid let go of his hair, and pouted. “Nobody ever takes the fun way…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.3</p><p class="double">Twilight’s horn crackled, spitting out bolts of multicoloured light every time she saw a target. Return fire splashed off her shield, and she dove through a window to get out of the direct line of fire.</p><p class="double">“Twily!” her brother said, happiness in his voice. Then his tone became more serious. “How’s things?”</p><p class="double">“Not good, really…” Twilight admitted. “The west flank’s crumbling – they must have shifted their reserves around to hit us there.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, ponyfeathers,” Shining shook his head. “Sergeant, take our own reserve and shore us up.”</p><p class="double">“That won’t hold long…” the younger sibling warned, projecting a map. Blue ‘friendly’ dots were winking out rapidly, and the green of confirmed enemies just kept coming.</p><p class="double">“I know, but we don’t have a better choice,” Shining replied.</p><p class="double">“Fair point.” Twilight’s eyes flicked up for a second, as she changed frequencies on her shield. “This should be a bit better.”</p><p class="double">The ground shook, faintly at first, but then building to an incredible grinding rumble before finally dying away.</p><p class="double">“Well, so much for the <i>east</i> flank…” Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">“That was Trixie?” Shining asked.</p><p class="double">“The ground shook too much for it to be anypony else. Wonder how they got her…”</p><p class="double">Four guards backed into the room, lashing out with spells from their horns as magic flew past in return. “Sir, we’ve lost contact with-”</p><p class="double">Twilight’s eyes narrowed, and she stunned all four of them.</p><p class="double">They fell, flashing with green flame and reverting to their base forms.</p><p class="double">“Thought so…”</p><p class="double">More changelings appeared at the window, and then the ceiling broke open.</p><p class="double">Green magic flashed from above, and after twenty frantic seconds bolts got past both Twilight’s shield and her brother’s.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” came a shout from outside.</p><p class="double">Wings buzzing, Queen Chrysalis entered the room. “I win. At last.”</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Twilight said, rolling back upright. “Good game. Same time next week?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” They shook hooves.</p><p class="double">“I have to say, Twily,” Shining muttered, rubbing a bruise ruefully, “these changelings are <i>very</i> good at magic tag.”</p><p class="double">“Comes of the hive mind,” Chrysalis said, with a slightly brittle casualness.</p><p class="double">A blue unicorn trotted into the room. “Trixie thinks that was unfair.”</p><p class="double">“It was a shield…” Chrysalis rolled her eyes. “You do this every week. Shields, disguises, swarm tactics… no matter how we beat you, it’s somehow unfair by your lights.”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Trixie said, with the tone of somepony explaining a simple concept to a foal. “Trixie does not get defeated in a fair fight. Ergo, the fights she loses are not fair.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis threw up her hooves. “This is ridiculous!”</p><p class="double">“Hey, at least you only have to deal with this kind of attitude once per week…” Twilight countered.</p><p class="double">The Changeling Queen paused, and then nodded. “Fair point.”</p><p class="double">“Trixie chooses to reject that conversation and substitute one about how awesome she is!” Trixie shouted.</p><p class="double">“Oh, grow up!” Chrysalis shot back.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is the most unconventional plan you have come up with for integrating us yet,” Chrysalis said to Twilight, then took a sip of cocoa. </p><p class="double">“Well, playing sports does help ponies get closer,” Twilight said, shrugging. “It started as an idea after a Loop somewhere where wars are done by mutual agreement in special arenas, but the idea wouldn’t go away…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.4</p><p class="double">“Do you know, I find myself rather perplexed by you,” Celestia said, lightly.</p><p class="double">Nyx looked up from an ice cream. “Really?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed I do.” Celestia inclined her teacup at the filly. “You are, as far as I understand it, generated from a version of my sister. Endowed with life but none of her memories, and then you got an abridged version of Luna’s time as Nightmare Moon.”</p><p class="double">“That’s right,” Nyx said, going back to the ice cream for a second. Then she looked up, with big innocent eyes. “So what’s the problem again?”</p><p class="double">“Well – oh, goodness, but you do those well,” Celestia said with something like admiration. “I bet you could charm the whole parliament.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks!”</p><p class="double">“Anyway. My point.” Celestia made a small gesture. “You have, at my last count, had no fewer than forty loops in which I am also a participant. Based on what I know about the Loops, there must have been many more where I was not lucky enough to also be present.”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much. Ooh, there’s boysenberry ice cream in this…” Nyx carefully manipulated the ice cream. “You don’t see that much.”</p><p class="double">“And, well, there you rather make my point.”</p><p class="double">“I do?” Nyx licked her lips clean of ice cream.</p><p class="double">“You’re well over two hundred years old, you see…” Celestia pointed. “And you still act very much like a young filly.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked back at the oldest of the Princesses for a moment. Then she balanced her ice cream carefully on the point and hit it with an ice spell, keeping it from falling over. “Okay, I’ll explain.”</p><p class="double">“Please do,” Celestia invited.</p><p class="double">“First thing is… in my home loop, or, in my first loop ‘cause this <i>is </i>kind of a home loop… the only really happy life I had was with momma-Twilight, as a little filly. When I was grown up as Nightmare Moon I was… just miserable.” Nyx shrugged uncomfortably. “I don’t like to remember it too much.”</p><p class="double">“And now?”</p><p class="double">“Now is kind of the same thing… I still remember being, well, <i>Nightmare Moon</i>. I still remember faint echoes of that need to get revenge on an uncaring world… but it’s really kind of hard to have that super evil powerful hate when you’re going to school and doing homework.” The young alicorn shook her head. “I prefer being nice, really. And being a filly makes me feel much more comfortable generally.”</p><p class="double">“It seems we all have our burdens to bear,” Celestia said, with a nod.</p><p class="double">“There’s another side to it, too, of course,” Nyx said, grinning much more comfortably. “Fillies get ice cream and stuff.”</p><p class="double">“A fair point indeed!” Celestia chuckled. “Actually, that gives me an idea…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Who’s this?” Pinkie asked Twilight. “She looks cute!”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded down at the filly. “She’s called Helia – one of Nyx’s pen friends. I’m looking after her for the week. No, I don’t know why she’s got wings and a horn either.”</p><p class="double">“Okie dokie.” Pinkie gave the young alicorn a conspiratorial look. “Hey, you want some ice cream?”</p><p class="double">“Do I?” Helia asked with a big grin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis grumbled to herself as she finished <i>another</i> tranche of paperwork.</p><p class="double">Why the buck had she ever agreed to fill in for Celestia for a week? The alicorn had enough paperwork to choke a dragon!</p><p class="double">“Your highness,” the seneschal said, motioning to the door, “the court is to be in session momentarily.”</p><p class="double">“Do you mean soon, or for a short time?” Chrysalis asked, mentally checking her disguise was perfect.</p><p class="double">“The first one, of course, your highness.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” Chrysalis echoed. “Silly me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And so, you see, I don’t know what to do…” the stallion trailed off into mumbling.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis tasted his emotions. He didn’t have all that much hope, which perhaps wasn’t surprising – the position he was trying to advance was that he had lost much of his life’s savings in a disaster, though he himself had come through as had enough to allow him to live reasonably comfortably.</p><p class="double">But the money he’d been saving up to start a newspaper, his life’s ambition, was not available from what remained of his assets.</p><p class="double">The disguised Changeling wondered how Celestia would have resolved this. She probably would have weighed benefit against loss, deftly reshuffled funds and personalities, and linked the stallion up with either a suitably rich noble or a public works project or… something.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis didn’t have nearly that expertise… but she could sense the stallion’s sincerity, and that was enough for her.</p><p class="double">“The crown will provide funds for your project, in exchange for a thirty percent share. See the treasurer for a draft on the vaults.”</p><p class="double">Surprise, then gratitude, blossomed in the stallion’s mind like a silent supernova, and approval – and the deep, abiding love that Celestia invoked in her subjects – washed in from the walls.</p><p class="double">And since they were aimed <i>at</i> Chrysalis, at the results of <i>her</i> actions, she could absorb them with no harm to the originators at all.</p><p class="double"><i>This is why</i>, she thought, as outwardly she nodded gravely for the next case. <i>Aside from anything else, it’s like eating a gourmet meal every night.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that was interesting…” Prince Shining Armor muttered, wiping cake off his muzzle with a napkin.</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight shrugged her wings. “Sorry, Shiny. I know you’re new to the Elements…”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. We could have practised, maybe?” Shining Armor lifted the Loyalty necklace off his head, carefully making sure it didn’t get too much icing on it. “One of the things I don’t want to hear when facing down Discord is ‘wait, you <i>can</i> use these, right?’”</p><p class="double">“I said I was sorry…” Twilight said meekly. “Anyway, we did it. So, now, how do we divide things up?”</p><p class="double">Shining shrugged. “You’re the expert.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’d say military and civilian, but we don’t actually <i>have</i> much of a military.” Twilight shrugged. “Nor do they normally have much to do, aside from keeping the peace.”</p><p class="double">“Nah, that’ll be fine.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at him carefully. “If you say so.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, that’s the patrol routes worked out.” Shining shuffled his papers and handed them to Corporal Rockhoof, who accepted them and took them out of the room.</p><p class="double">“What’s next?”</p><p class="double">Shining’s aide looked lost. “What do you mean, my prince?”</p><p class="double">“I mean, what’s next on the agenda?”</p><p class="double">“Sire, you’ve been off the agenda for six months. You’ve been doing everypony else’s work. For the sake of the founders, my prince, you just reorganized the patrol routes in a remote town near Stalliongrad.”</p><p class="double">“Not following you.” Shining tapped an office toy on his desk, which started clacking merrily.</p><p class="double">“There’s no work left to <i>do</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Check again,” Shining instructed.</p><p class="double">“I did. Twice.”</p><p class="double">“Well, then.” Prince Shining Armor adjusted his chain of office (something that his sister had looked askance at), and strode out of his office.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Twilight Sparkle knocked on her brother’s door. “Hey, Shiny?”</p><p class="double">“Come in,” Shining said, and Twilight opened the door.</p><p class="double">Paperwork was piled high on the desk, and Shining was flicking through it with every appearance of enjoyment.</p><p class="double">“Oh, what’s all this in aid of?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, there was a nasty couple of robberies last night. Big money stuff. So that means a lot of work for the guard, of course. I’m coordinating the investigation, so hopefully we’ll catch this pony before they do it again.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. “That’s terrible!”</p><p class="double">“Well, not really.” Shining shrugged. “For whatever reason, they only stole about a tenth of what was actually there, so…”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight said, frowning. “That <i>is</i> strange.”</p><p class="double">“Tell me about it… so, how are things going with you?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’ve decided to subsidize authors heavily, and see just how many books get written as a result. There’s a lot of society-engineering experiments I only really get a chance to do in these loops…” Twilight grinned. “Besides, I need <i>some</i> new books to read.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, fair point.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What, another one?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Shining said, shaking his head. “We’re no closer to this stallion than before. He stole the penthouse off a Manehattan skyrise.”</p><p class="double">“He?” Twilight asked, interested. “You got <i>something</i>, then?”</p><p class="double">“Or she.” Shining corrected himself.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, thinking.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, this is just ridiculous,” Twilight said loudly.</p><p class="double">The black-clad figure on the floor below froze, then looked up slowly.</p><p class="double">“Er… your highness?”</p><p class="double">“Lay off it, Shining, I know it’s you.” Twilight glided down from the catwalk. “You’re faking crimes so you have work to do, aren’t you.”</p><p class="double">With a flash of purple magic, the costume disintegrated.</p><p class="double">“All right, I was,” Shining Armor admitted, dropping his sack full of stolen museum exhibits on the floor. “I was <i>so</i> <i>bored!</i>”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “And you were doing <i>so</i> well… right, I think it’s moon time.”</p><p class="double">“Does it have to be?” Shining asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, it might not have to be if your thefts were lower profile. But, one way or another, this investigation you started has got out of your control. I’m only about two steps ahead of the Guard on this one.”</p><p class="double">“So…”</p><p class="double">“So we pass it off as the Alicorn Amulet corrupting you, that’s what.” Twilight threw it to him. “One big battle over the city, and then you’re off to the moon until I’ve got an Elements team assembled. Look on the bright side, though.”</p><p class="double">Shining slipped the pendant on, and his horn began to glow. A reddish tinge started slipping into the magic. “Bright side?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. By the time you get back, Cadence is going to be an adult.”</p><p class="double">The Prince nodded thoughtfully. Then opened fire.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So we need to go sort out the arrangements for the mid-year celebration?” Twilight’s oldest student, Celestia, asked.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that’s right.” Twilight nodded. “I recommend that the three of you get going. Though, actually, could Cadence stay behind? I’d like a word with her.”</p><p class="double">Celestia and Luna nodded, and left. (As it happened, they were in the ‘slots’ normally assigned to Shining and Twilight respectively. Twilight had taken on more than one student because, well, why not.)</p><p class="double">“So,” Cadence grinned. “He lost <i>that</i> little bet…”</p><p class="double">“Yes, he did.” Twilight smiled back; it had been a surprise five years ago when Cadence Awakened, but also a relief. “Just a head’s up, though, he was using the Alicorn Amulet – that’s the official reason for his banishment, and you know what that thing’s like.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, stereotypical villainy mode.” Cadence got a light in her eyes. “Does this mean he’ll kidnap me?”</p><p class="double">“That’s entirely possible, I’m afraid,” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“Afraid?” Cadence shook her head. “I’m not <i>afraid.</i> I’m <i>anticipatory.”</i></p><p class="double">“…moving on,” Twilight said quickly. “I don’t know exactly how the Elements are going to break down this time. Just, well, make sure Luna doesn’t blow up at Pinkie or something…”</p><p class="double">“Will do, Twilight.” Cadence flipped up a wing in salute, then giggled. “Hang on, I have to go get some Cosmic Spectrum stone…”</p><p class="double"><i>Wonder what she’s up to,</i> Twilight thought absently.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You’ll never get away with this!” Luna shouted.</p><p class="double">“Actually, I think you’ll find I already have,” the dark stallion said with a menacing chuckle, his voice resonating with the walls. “Not only have I kidnapped you, I have also turned the lovely Cadence to my side!”</p><p class="double">“Muahaha and stuff,” Cadence said, trotting out from behind him.</p><p class="double">“You monster!” Luna struggled with the magical shields holding her down. “How did you corrupt such an innocent pony?”</p><p class="double">The alicorn’s eyes lost a little of their red glow. “I’m not entirely sure, actually. I was planning to use her as a hostage, but that didn’t pan out because hostages don’t normally take their captors side this fast. And now she’s an alicorn for some reason.”</p><p class="double">“Go Shiny!” Cadence said, waving pom-poms.</p><p class="double">Luna shook her head. “You’re really lowering the tone, here, Cadence.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry.” Cadence put the pom-poms down and kicked them away. “I’m enthusiastic, okay?”</p><p class="double">“Now, as I was saying. I am unstoppable!” The alicorn amulet gleamed redly below his neck. “The Elements of Harmony will only activate for a full six ponies, so with young Luna here-”</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Luna said, eyes suddenly intent. “They require six ponies?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Sundered Armor said, his voice still gleaming with malice.</p><p class="double">At that point, the door exploded in under a laser lance of sunlight.</p><p class="double">“Luna!” Celestia said, horn flaring, as she charged through the door with Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and Rarity behind her. “Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“I’ve been better…” Luna said pointedly.</p><p class="double">“We’re here to save you!” Celestia waved the Element of Magic around, then put it on her forehead. The other five matched her with their necklaces.</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Sundered looked resigned. “Well, bu-”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Now for you,” Celestia said, pointing at Cadence. “Don’t worry, you’ll be alright soon.”</p><p class="double">“I’m alright now,” Cadence said, shrugging. “No actual corruption involved. Now sit down before you fall down, Celly, you look exhausted.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Celestia sank back onto the floor, keeping an eye on the collapsed and younger Shining Armor. “Why did you join him, then?”</p><p class="double">Cadence blushed. “He’s a hunk, that’s why.”</p><p class="double">“Well, then,” Princess Twilight said, flashing into existence. “Good to see that all worked out. Congratulations on the new horn, Cadence.”</p><p class="double">“Do you know <i>everything</i> before we do?” Luna asked, stretching.</p><p class="double">“Not quite.” Twilight winked. “Anyway, I see you’ve met my brother.”</p><p class="double">The Elements and Luna all paused.</p><p class="double">“Now y’all say it, yer highness, ah do kinda see the family resemblance…” Applejack ventured. “How come he went loco?”</p><p class="double">“Underwork,” Twilight summarized. “Now, shall we go and have that mid-year celebration? I think we all need to relax. And yes, Cadence, you can ‘keep him’, so long as he follows you home.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.6</p><p class="double">“For, you see, I am not in truth a skink,” the small reptile said. “I am a handsome dragon, turned thus by the spell of a witch. I need but a kiss to-”</p><p class="double">Twilight skidded into the garden. “Hi, guys, big problem. We – wait a second.”</p><p class="double">She looked between the skink and the suddenly blushing Rarity. “Were you two seriously reenacting the Princess and the Frog? No, on second thoughts I don&#039;t want to know...”</p><p class="double">With a moment of morphic uncertainty, Spike returned to his default size nowadays – about the same mass as Twilight, but bipedal instead of quadrupedal. “Ahem. What was that, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Twilight pointed. “Basically, have you guys ever heard of frost giants?”</p><p class="double">Both Spike and Rarity shook their heads.</p><p class="double">“Right. Well, neither had I until one came over the border. They&#039;re kind of like the bigger, meaner cousins of Windigoes.” Twilight counted on her hooves. “Four, five... and Dash isn&#039;t Awake this Loop... in fact, I think she&#039;s in San Equus or something. It&#039;s just going to be easier for you to sub in, Spike.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha.” Spike summoned his Element with a flash of red light.</p><p class="double">Rarity matched him, and transitioned up to Alicorn with the ease of long practise. “When do we go?”</p><p class="double">“Few minutes,” Twilight replied. “I&#039;ll teleport us all to Vanhoofer, that&#039;s where it&#039;s approaching.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe it just wants a coffee?” Spike suggested, stretching.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s Seaddle, of course, dear,” Rarity corrected him.</p><p class="double">“Oh, my mistake.”</p><p class="double">Twilight wove a net of magic about them-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">-and they were looking at a very distinctive mountain range being stepped on by something taller than said mountains.</p><p class="double">“Whoa, that&#039;s big...” Spike muttered. “I hope you don&#039;t want us to wrestle it...”</p><p class="double">“No, that&#039;s fine.” Twilight vanished again, then deposited Fluttershy, Applejack, Pinkie and Trixie next to them in quick succession.</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go.” Twilight went Alicorn, and the rest followed suit. “I&#039;ve got no idea how nasty this thing is, so we&#039;d better err on the side of overdoing it. Trix, you want to play defence?”</p><p class="double">“It depends what defence means.” Trixie began casting her own enhancement spells.</p><p class="double">“Explode it until we&#039;re ready.”</p><p class="double">“DIBS!” the blue alicorn shouted, and promptly broke about five Equestrian laws on responsible magic channeling levels. Then three more on excessive noise levels, two which governed what spell-types were permitted within metropolitan areas, and something to do with sunburn on top of that.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Guys, focus!” Twilight said sharply.</p><p class="double">“Sorry,” Spike said, shaking his head to clear it. “Trixie&#039;s impressive when she gets going.”</p><p class="double">“This is why I don&#039;t take <i>any</i> fashion direction from her...” Rarity confirmed. “She&#039;d try to make an exploding dress.”</p><p class="double">The ice giant slipped, its huge feet not finding proper purchase on a lake of lava. A tiny blue spark, shining like a star, flitted above it and began launching yet more attacks.</p><p class="double">“Okay, done!” Twilight said finally, and rainbow light sliced across the sky.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So...” Rarity said, uncertainly, once the press had been persuaded to leave them alone. “What was that all in aid of?”</p><p class="double">“I have no idea.” Twilight shrugged. “Suppose it&#039;s a Loop variant, that&#039;s all – I&#039;ve <i>been</i> to the Frozen North a lot before, if they were standard issue I&#039;d have met them before.”</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy raised a hoof.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” several of them said at once.</p><p class="double">“I think that was a... they turn up in stories on Oerth. It&#039;s a Xixecal.”</p><p class="double">“Say that again, but slower?” Applejack requested.</p><p class="double">“Xixecal.”</p><p class="double">“Nope, still no idea how t&#039; pronounce it...”</p><p class="double">“Okay, so what are they?” Twilight asked, to forestall the confusing argument she could see coming.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Er... sort of like half-made gods, or something. They&#039;re often a concept made material – like that one was cold. They&#039;re mentioned in druid training, but I forgot...” Fluttershy shrank back into her chair a bit. “Sorry. They scare me.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s fine,” Twilight reassured her automatically. “Can you tell if there&#039;s any others?”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Fluttershy closed her eyes for a moment, then they opened again.</p><p class="double">“Well?”</p><p class="double">She nodded. “Two. One called a phaheon – it&#039;s made of lava – and one called a Phane. The Phane does time dilation.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll handle him!” Pinkie said eagerly. “I can bring all my apprentices!”</p><p class="double">“Apprentices?” Twilight parroted.</p><p class="double">“Yeah! I wouldn&#039;t normally, but I&#039;m totally going to go and get the mirror pool going again!”</p><p class="double">“Well, we&#039;re doomed...” Spike said conversationally.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Wait, I just realized. Where&#039;s Trixie?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Trixie demands justice! Or she will swear everlasting vengeance. Or, on balance, simply insist Twilight pays for her lunch for a Loop.”</p><p class="double">The blue-coated alicorn looked down at Equestria hanging below her, and continued spellcasting.</p><p class="double">Intellectually, she knew it was just being so close to the monster which had caught her in a high powered use of the Elements.</p><p class="double">Emotionally, she was going to write something defamatory on the moon about Twilight Sparkle until she felt better. Then she was going to look into a non-magical method of lunar escape.</p><p class="double"><i>It&#039;s not like it&#039;s rocket science, right? Oops, bad analogy.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.7 (Grinnerz)</p><p class="double">Twilight Greenhilt had a very slight problem. “Why is it that I almost always wake up as human mid-stride? And how do the locals balance on such thin legs anyway? And WHAT am I wearing? …Okay, the purple top and pink skirt I get, but why the bare midriff? No matter, on to learning!” She was not going to pass up the first day awake at an academy of magic she hadn’t been to before after all.</p><p class="double">Walking through the halls of Warthog’s School of Wizardry and Sorcery she couldn’t help but overhear snippets of conversations. The speech bubbles took some getting used to though.</p><p class="double">“…and that’s why the d100 is a superior percentile than two d10.”</p><p class="double">“…so I told Stacy, like, I <i>rolled</i> my stats. This 17 Charisma: all natural. Not like that cloak she always wears.”</p><p class="double">‘<i>Okay this loop’s a bit outside the norm for me, but I can roll with it.’</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Suddenly the bell began to ring calling students to class. The seeing the stairway she needed already clogged by her peers Twilight ran down ways to speed her passage. “No, I will not be tardy the first day. Let’s see what local magic can do. <b><i>Dimension Hop.</i></b>”</p><p class="double">A bystander had this to say:”Ugh, <i>sooo not</i> a core spell.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sitting down at the back of the class Twilight took a moment to observe her classmates. She did a double take as a Harry Potter look-alike sat two rows up. A red-haired kid across the room seemed to be staring at her, though why he had a pointed ear on the right side of his head and no one else had visible ears at all she didn’t know. In fact none of the other students had visible anythings under their pulled up hoods.</p><p class="double">A grey haired woman walked into the room. “Welcome class to Necromancy 101. I’ll be your homeroom teacher Professor McDougal. Now I’m going to call roll.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Greenhilt.”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“Pompey.”</p><p class="double">“Here.” It was the red-haired boy.</p><p class="double">“Larry Gardener.”</p><p class="double">“Here, guvnor.” The Not-Potter said.</p><p class="double">“He Who Must Not Be Named”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“The One Who Must Not Be Named”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“She Who Must Not Be Looked At.”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“They Who Must Not Be Spoken To.”</p><p class="double">“…” “…”</p><p class="double">“Right, never mind. He Who Must Not Be Toilet-Trained…” *Sniff-sniff* “Pompey I believe you are on mop duty this week.”</p><p class="double">*Sigh* “Yes Professor.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">‘<i>And other loopers say Equestria is weird. Alright: diagnostic spell complete. Pinkie is here somewhere but not nearby. Other than that there is no one I can detect. Well, how much trouble can she get into anyway?’</i></p><p class="double">A flash of lightning and a crack of thunder interrupted her thoughts.</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry class: the druid college down the road is practising controlling the weather today.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“<b><i>Meanwhile, deep in the Redmountain Hills our intrepid band of adventurers: The Order of the Stick is camped.

It’s usually Elan, but you’re here instead.” Turning to Durkon, Roy continued.” So… more-or-less baseline?

Besides, I’m morbidly curious as to what Nale will be like with her here.”</p><p class="double">“Ooooooh, another door!” Rushing forward, yet again ignoring Haley’s protests about searching for traps, Pinkie grabbed the knob and yanked open a rather nondescript brown door.</p><p class="double">“Woah.” “Woah.”</p><p class="double">“Speak of the devils…” Roy and Durkon leaned to the side a bit and noted no changes among their evil opposites until they got to the head of the line. There they saw a shift from the norm.</p><p class="double">Like usual, the figure’s clothing had an opposite colour scheme than Elan, or Pinkie in this case. But whereas Pinkie had wild pink hair the newcomer’s was strait as a razor, and the gleam in her eyes was less welcoming than Pinkie’s friendly insanity. And of course, the one feature they had been half expecting…</p><p class="double">“Wowie-zowie! I look good with a goatee!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.8 (Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie blinked.</p><p class="double">She was suddenly in her room Sugarcube Corner. She had Awoke again! What kinds of fun she&#039;d have this loop?</p><p class="double">&#039;Wait a little, let me check something first.&#039; And so she checked her surroundings: no access to worshippers for chaos magic, and her loop memories told her this seemed a baseline loop. Looking at the window she could see Matilda going a bit slower than usual (the news of Princess Celestia coming to Ponyville to raise the sun herself made her a bit melancholic for Cranky Doodle), which seemed to confirm this idea.</p><p class="double">Yep, baseline loop all right. Pinkie wondered if Big Mac is awake this time as she had a super special idea for the bar--</p><p class="double">Baseline loop? Pinkie Pie stopped and was reminded of something very important. Concentrating in her Element of Laughter she peeked to check which other elements were Awoke. With a happy feeling much like the Diet Cola volcano would feel when the Mentos stalactites fall in she received two answers: Magic and Loyalty.</p><p class="double">Dashie is awake? That changes all the plans: the Prank Wars versus Dashie start now! First one to force the other to use a non-baseline ability wins! Checking her loop memories Pinkie Pie realized the hidden town props were in pattern Cake-4-Tea. That&#039;d surely will give them a good head start! With some luck she might win even before Twilight arrives to Ponyville.</p><p class="double">Having set in her plan, Pinkie Pie trotted out of her room. She had to move quickly, after all early to Awake gets to dethrone Discord.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Wearing her Groucho glasses Pinkie Pie hid inside a cardboard box by the park pondered her next move. Rainbow Dash had been a thought cookie, like one stale for a few weeks: even when Pinkie put a statue near the town hall and starting advertising herself as a priest of the Church of Discord hadn&#039;t bore fruits. Well, Dashie knows Discord may be awake and all.</p><p class="double">Going for Anarchism again? Not too hard but not good for this time. Fluttershy isn&#039;t Awake and her nonlooper self is still too timid to help Pinkie in making an Equestrian revolution. Even if she had been awake, asking for looper help in the pranks was against the rules.</p><p class="double">Idea! She had to find Lyra while making her way to Sugarcube Corner to get a rope, meringue, her candy-copter, flour, a spell cast, a parasol and some frosting. To the Pinkie-cave!</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><i>One</i></p><p class="double">Pinkie saw a rainbow-colored streak of light going through the sky.</p><p class="double"><i>Two</i></p><p class="double">It looks like Dashie&#039;s meeting with Twilight is going as baseline, and now she&#039;s trying to clear the sky in ten seconds flat.</p><p class="double"><i>Three</i></p><p class="double">But Pinkie had counted on that, leaving a surprise on a cloud.</p><p class="double"><i>Four</i></p><p class="double">Asking looper help was off-limits, but nopony said Pinkie couldn&#039;t ask Lyra to cast a cloud-walking spell on her.</p><p class="double"><i>Five</i></p><p class="double">Then it was only a matter of getting to a cloud with the candy-copter. Pinkie almost looked like Applejack when she lassoed it!</p><p class="double"><i>Six</i></p><p class="double">Than Pinkie had to use her Earth Pony magic in the flour to make the cloud could hold as much meringue and frosting as possible, leaving the most sticky cloud since ever.</p><p class="double"><i>Seven</i></p><p class="double">Getting down was just a matter of jumping down and opening the parasol at a proper time,</p><p class="double"><i>Eight</i></p><p class="double">She&#039;s coming to the cloud, just in time and with a very fast dive. Perfect</p><p class="double"><i>Nine</i></p><p class="double">Aaaand... there! Just when she was going to pass through the last cloud in the sky she got stuck into it, and being unable to flap her wings she couldn&#039;t do other thing than fall to the ground. Perfect!</p><p class="double">Then Pinkie Pie walked to the grounds where Dashie had fell, She had to check when currently trapped pegasus surrendered the bet after all. It was then when she realized somepony purple in the corner of her eyes.</p><p class="double">Upon that Pinkie extended her hooves sideways as to block Twilight&#039;s path and looked at her unicorn friend. &quot;Wait a moment Twilight, we are in the middle of our Prank Wars. No help now until Dashie surrenders.&quot;</p><p class="double">Though to her surprise if wasn&#039;t Twilight who answered. &quot;You know, Pinkie,&quot; she heard Spike&#039;s voice and turned to the other side only to realize he was as tall as her, &quot;I don&#039;t think Rainbow is Awake right now.&quot; And then he concentrated a bit to make his own Element of Loyalty appear in his hand.</p><p class="double">Erm... &quot;Oopsie?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.9 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">&quot;Raaaahhhh!&quot; A vast blast of dragon fire burst from the cave mouth.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle walked out of the cave, mane singed in a humorous manner. &quot;Well that didn&#039;t work. I quoted all the relevant parts of the treaty of Lonely Mountain. While that dragon is allowed to use the cave as a stop-over, he&#039;s not allowed to set up a semi-permanent residence there. That&#039;s why we have dragon zoning in the Everfree Forest! Maybe I overdid it with the half hour presentation, and the slide show...&quot;</p><p class="double">An outside observer who knew of such things, would have deduced the entire mane six, plus Spike, were looping from the lack of terror at their fearless leader having been subjected to the equivalent of a blast from a ship mounted plasma cannon. Oh, and that Spike was snuggled up against Rarity, who was cracking open a geode and feeding him gems in the manner of a girl peeling grapes. She spoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, should I ask Spikey-wikey to act as my champion when I go in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like you need one, even without going full alicorn.&quot; Applejack commented, reshaping the earth into little dragon statues. &quot;You duke it out with Spike when he&#039;s cranked up to, what the hay was it, Great Wyrm? Big and mean and about the size of Buckingham palace anyhow.&quot;</p><p class="double">The little dragon cracked his knuckles. &quot;Okay, I won&#039;t crank myself higher than Young Adult. Beating that Old guy with an equivalent age category just isn&#039;t a challenge any more.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh!&quot; Twilight shook her head, smoothing out her mane with a cosmetic spell. &quot;Rainbow&#039;s got next place on the rota this time remember? After the thing at the place...&quot;</p><p class="double">The ponies shuddered, except for Pinkie, who grinned brightly. &quot;But it was such a cool way to use a dozen cubic hooves of liquid rainbow and a raw egg!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash recovered quickly, and flew up in the air. &quot;Aw yeah! Yo, big red, you in there! If you aren&#039;t going to play nice with the other foals, I&#039;m gonna fly in there and kick you right in the jaw!&quot;</p><p class="double">A blast of smoke engulfed her from the cave mouth. It blasted away to reveal the clear pocket of air she&#039;d wrapped around herself with her weather magic. &quot;Okay buddy, you asked for it!&quot;</p><p class="double">She shot off, away from the mountaintop, cracking out her first rainbow shockwave before she&#039;d gotten more than a few hundred pony-lengths. The rainbow contrail vanished into the sky, only to turn into the trail of a glowing polychromatic comet a few moments later. Twilight did some calculations based on the pegasus&#039;s rate of approach and decided she&#039;d grown even stronger since her friend last tested herself. The purple unicorn cast a structural integrity spell at range... on the dragon. This way it would only feel like he was getting his head ripped off by the impact, rather than it actually happening.</p><p class="double">Dash arrived at high mach numbers, encased in a glowing rainbow aura and vanished into the cave, rear hoof first in a flying kick. An instant later, the dragon flew out of the cave&#039;s rear entrace, newly created by it&#039;s body being smashed through the back wall. It fell a good way, then managed to right itself in mid-air, and blast her with superheated plasma, which split around either side of her as she guided the air-flow. The subsequent beat down was short and brutal, for the dragon. It dwarfed the pegasus fighting it to insignificance, and it didn&#039;t matter.</p><p class="double">Ultiimately Dash carried the dragon back by it&#039;s tail, which she held in her teeth, as the dragon was hurt too badly to still fly. She laid him out on the ledge in front of the others. &quot;Uh... that rainbow one kicked me!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy trotted over, showing only the slightest trace of her once fear. Becoming an Alicorn, staring down Discord a few hundred times, not to mention the God Emperor of Mankind had helped her overcome it... not to mention that as a high level druid, her will save was off the top of the charts. She laid her hooves to the dragon&#039;s fore-paw claw and cast Heal (not that the spell needed contact, but she felt it would be more reassuring.) &quot;I know, and I&#039;m sure she&#039;s very sorry about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually I&#039;m not.&quot; Dash stated, flexing her wings to get the kinks out. &quot;That was a great workout.&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon&#039;s injuries had vanished, in fact he felt like a vast hoard of gems. &quot;You caught me off guard. Next time you won&#039;t be so lucky.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rather than quailing, the rainbow pegasus seemed pleased. &quot;Wanna prove that? Best of three!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa Dash!&quot; Twilight called out. &quot;Sparring later. We&#039;re still sorting out the fact that he... I&#039;m sorry sir, I didn&#039;t get your name.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am Vantuvir the Mighty, Vantuvir of the Flaming Scale, Vantuvir the Wrath Bringer...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, Mr Vantuvir here shouldn&#039;t actually be sleeping here. Smoke covering all of Equestria, remember?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... actually Twilight, I cured the snoring while I was healing him. It was a symptom of the obstructive form of sleep apnoea. It can lead to all kinds of nasty secondary effects.&quot; She turned to the dragon and gave him a low level Stare. &quot;You should take better care of yourself mister!&quot; </p><p class="double">The dragon flinched and looked away, instead focussing on the flyer above. &quot;Now your friend healed me up, I can crush you!&quot;</p><p class="double">His head was forcefully turned to face Twilight by a grip of purple magic. &quot;Now just stop that! If you act up again, you won&#039;t face just her, you face all of us...&quot;</p><p class="double">She was blasted by another wave of dragon fire, which splashed back at him from the bowl shaped shield of purple force that formed in front of her. &quot;That didn&#039;t work last time, why did you think this would be any different? Applejack?&quot;</p><p class="double">The farm-pony nodded and placed her hooves against the outcropping, which reshaped itself into a stylised sculpture of a dragon. she then turned and kicked it with her hind hooves, splitting it off at the base and sending it flying away from the plateau. It was caught by Twilight&#039;s magic, and hauled back to hover in mid-air, without her releasing her telekinetic grip on the real dragon. </p><p class="double">&quot;We may not be as big as you...&quot; The glow around the statue brightened, and compressed to crush the statue to pebbles. &quot;... but we ponies have our own strength.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And they&#039;ve got us too!&quot; Spike said, moving into his line of sight. &quot;Me and Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A silly frilly pony and a wyrmling?&quot; Vantuvir exclaimed incredulously.</p><p class="double">Spike made a pose and flexed his muscles, which began to swell, and didn&#039;t stop. He exploded upwards until he towered over the dragon in full Great Wyrm form, with Rarity riding his shoulder ridge.</p><p class="double">&quot;You were saying?&quot; he rumbled. &quot;I suggest you apologise to my beloved. Rarity is the most precious of gems to me, more valued than a mountain of flawless diamond. She&#039;s beautiful, generous, beautiful, can find gems with her magic, beautiful, courageous, beautiful, refined... and did I mention beautiful? Well it&#039;s worth saying again!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Spikey-wikey, you&#039;re so sweet!&quot; Rarity nuzzled into his neck ridges.</p><p class="double">He leaned over the crimson dragon and glared at him, and the other dragon quailed again. He had enough quails by now to feed a banquet. &quot;I... apologise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Great Wyrm Spike grinned, which was only marginally less terrifying. &quot;By the way, I think you should know I&#039;m not the one you should be worried about. Even a romance for the ages such as ours has it&#039;s rough spots, and on the few occasions we fought, she&#039;s beaten me two times out of three. So, word to the wise, just do as they say, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon gave a huff and said, &quot;I don&#039;t have a choice, do I!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great!&quot; Twilight said brightly. &quot;Now as to the cave you&#039;ll be moving to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; The dragon looked completely non-plussed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just because you can&#039;t stay here, doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t understand you need somewhere to rest. Rarity found a cavern on the outskirts of the badlands, it&#039;s almost as big as this one, plenty large enough for your hoard, and it has a couple of gemstone veins so if you wake up after a few decades with a case of the munchies, you don&#039;t have to deplete it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie piped up. &quot;I even made you a cave warming cake!&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled a cake taller than she was, heavily decorated with gems, from her sub-space pocket.</p><p class="double">&quot;Trust me, Pinkie&#039;s cakes are not to be sneezed at.&quot; Mega-Spike added, licking his lips.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well of course not!&quot; Pinkie looked up at the big dragon. &quot;They&#039;re made to be eaten! Of course if you sneezed at it, it would be sent to Princess Celestia, and while she likes cake, I don&#039;t think she&#039;d enjoy the gemstones...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But then why didn&#039;t you tell me about that?&quot; The dragon asked.</p><p class="double">&#039;Because you generally won&#039;t listen until some-pony knocks the stuffing out of you...&#039; muttered Twilight, then said out loud, &quot;That was on the next slide, complete with a picture. However, you incinerated my slide projector before I could get to it. C&#039;mon, we&#039;ll help you pack.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.10 (misterq)</p><p class="double">Twilight woke up in a forest to the grinning faces of a blue unicorn and a pink unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twilight; wake up!&quot; said the smiling blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, you silly sleepy head; wake up!&quot; the pink unicorn was positively grinning.</p><p class="double">Twilight just blinked and stared at the two unicorns in front of her. This was all a little too disturbingly familiar.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re going on an adventure, Twilight,&quot; the blue unicorn exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! Come with us, Twilight! It&#039;ll be an adventure!&quot; the pink one chimed in, &quot;We&#039;re going To Candy Mountain!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight kept staring at the two, deep in thought; before making up her mind. She turned to the blue unicorn and slowly said, &quot;What did you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me?&quot; The blue unicorn actually took a few steps back, &quot;I didn&#039;t do anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pink unicorn&#039;s eyes lost focus as her imagination ran wild, &quot;Candy Mountain! You fill me with sweet, sugary goodness!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just kept her accusatory stare on the blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;This loop is not the fault of the great and powerful Trixie,&quot; said the blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s certainty not the fault of unicorn Pinkie Pie,&quot; Twilight kept staring at Trixie. Idly, she wondered if Pinkie was actually insane this time or just pretending to be. &#039;Probably a little from both columns,&#039; she decided.</p><p class="double">The show-mare remained defiant, pausing only to look at Pinkie Pie; who had now started to sing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, when you&#039;re down and looking for some cheering up, then just head right on up to the Candy Mountain cave,&quot; the unicorn Pinkie Pie sang gleefully.</p><p class="double">Trixie broke down, &quot;Okay, fine. I mean, you try and alter the Giga Slave spell and accidentally blow up just one planet and suddenly, everything is Trixie&#039;s fault.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We were on the planet at the time, Trixie,&quot; Twilight deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;We were the only ones on the planet along with Pinkie Pie,&quot; Trixie defended herself, &quot;It was either experiment with spells or suffer a &#039;chimmi-cherry, cherry-changa&#039; level discussion until the loop ended.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued to sing obliviously, &quot;when you get inside, you&#039;ll find yourself a cheering land; such a happy and joyful and perky, merry land.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what, Trixie,&quot; Twilight said as she slowly got up while at the same time magically picking up a large oddly shaped rock, &quot;I&#039;m going to take this kidney-shaped rock and beat you with it until you learn not to cause extinction-level events ever again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on, there was no way I could have predicted that the unstable spell would backfire,&quot; Trixie started to backpedal away from a slowly, unflinchingly advancing Twilight. &quot;And I totally thought that thing was only a small moon, right up until I activated its superlaser. Also thanks to me, we now know that the accio summoning spell works just fine on large asteroids. And who knew that that would happen if Derpy&#039;s talent for entropy was amplified, right? No pony told me during that loop that her cutie mark represented a molecule with broken atomic bonds.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just kept walking at a steady pace, neither speeding up nor wavering. Trixie finally broke into a frantic gallop. Amidst the joyous singing of a mostly oblivious Pinkie Pie, the two other unicorns chased each other. </p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='33'></a><h3>MLP Loops 33</h3>
<p>33.1</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her eyes, and easily recognized one of the things which was clearly... a little off, about this loop.</p><p class="double"><i>Right, let&#039;s see...</p><p class="double"></i>Point one: she was human – to be precise, a young child. Not all that odd, but... notable, still.</p><p class="double">Point two: none of the other Elements were around.</p><p class="double">And point three: her loop memories had a severe overtone of phobia. For <i>horses</i>, of all things.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, I&#039;m a princess. Princess? No, small-p. The heir. But the heir presumptive, not the heir in law, interesting. Why? I&#039;m not a Herald. Mother – the Queen – is. And it&#039;s interesting that she&#039;s Queen Celestia, I must check if she&#039;s Awake.</p><p class="double">Heralds have Companions – magical horses, I think. I don&#039;t know much about that. Why am I scared of them?</p><p class="double"></i>To the child she was Replacing, it wouldn&#039;t have been at all obvious exactly what was behind the phobia. But to Twilight herself, with many years effectively spent as a politician... it was blatantly clear.</p><p class="double"><i>My nurse. Hulda.</p><p class="double"></i>Nothing to be done for now, except to get dressed and ready for the day. Whoever it was Twilight was taking the place of was a truly astonishing brat... that, at least, was easy to fix.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight stepped smartly out of her room, wincing internally at the cautious look a servant gave her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, your royal highness,&quot; Hulda said, walking up with a hint of surprise. &quot;You&#039;re up very early. And did you dress yourself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I did, Hulda,&quot; Twilight replied, with a carefully judged hint of deference.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you&#039;re forgetting yourself, your highness. After all, you don&#039;t have to dress yourself – that&#039;s what servants are for.&quot;</p><p class="double">This woman was setting Twilight&#039;s teeth on edge. She had been carefully and deliberately moulding the young princess into a disaster of a girl and even worse of a potential ruler.</p><p class="double">She did wonder why Celestia – or whoever Celestia was replacing – hadn&#039;t caught it yet, but the answer was simple enough. Chronic overwork, like usual.</p><p class="double">At least Celestia had the comfort of her Companion, this Loop. A large, robust mare whose coat was so dark that Twilight easily made the connection with Luna.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Hulda?&quot; Twilight asked, curiously. &quot;Why do you keep giving my other nurse that drink?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s medicine,&quot; Hulda said shortly. &quot;Come on, you have to-”</p><p class="double">&quot;But if it&#039;s medicine, why are you using magic to make her take it?”</p><p class="double">Hulda jerked as if stung, and Twilight fought down a grin. <i>Gotcha!</p><p class="double"></i>“Don&#039;t be silly,” the nurse said eventually. “Magic! You&#039;re imagining things.”</p><p class="double">“But I saw you cast the spell...” Twilight trailed off with artful uncertainty.</p><p class="double">At that point, the door opened.</p><p class="double">“Hello, Mother,” Twilight said, standing. “Did you know Hulda can do magic? She&#039;s so clever.”</p><p class="double">Celestia drew a slim sword. “So, you must be the accomplice.”</p><p class="double">“Accomplice?” Twilight parroted, slightly surprised at Celestia&#039;s willingness to draw steel.</p><p class="double">Hulda swore.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s hand crackled with electricity as she launched forward a stun spell, which smashed through a hastily raised shield and stunned the mage.</p><p class="double">“Well, I suppose that answers the question of whether or not you&#039;re Awake...” Celestia said, lowering the sword as guards rushed into the room. “A very nice touch, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks,” Twilight said, smiling. “I think the person I&#039;ve Replaced may have been supposed to have had a bit of magical talent herself.”</p><p class="double">Both of them paused.</p><p class="double">“That wasn&#039;t very easy on the tongue, was it...” Celestia remarked critically.</p><p class="double">“If I said she was sidestined to have magic, then you&#039;d have not understood me,” Twilight retorted. “I did invent this whole set of extra tenses, you know... Anyway, how did you know that fast?”</p><p class="double">“Give me credit,” Celestia said, sitting down on one of the chairs in the royal nursery. “One of my counsellors here was working against me. It took me a few hours to spot it, but they have a lovely spell here called the Truth spell. We should try to learn it...”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s notebook seemed to teleport into her hands (which wasn&#039;t a surprise, because it did.) “Truth spell? How much of a truth spell?”</p><p class="double">“Two levels. First level detects falsehood, second level forces truth.” Celestia smiled. “I suppose it might be a good one to teach Applejack.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, scribbling away. “Is Luna Awake?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, and complaining – a lot!” Celestia grinned, then shrugged. “Okay, Twilight, I&#039;ll go make sure the country&#039;s running properly. Fair warning – we&#039;ve got our work cut out for us here, this place isn&#039;t a great power like Equestria is and it has more enemies. That&#039;s why I went for the sword – I may as well start as I&#039;ll have to go on.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded soberly.</p><p class="double">It was hard to accept, sometimes, that there were Loops where friendship really couldn&#039;t fix anything. Not coincidentally, they often coincided with the Loops where Twilight was forced into human body shape and out of touch with most of her power.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, hello!” a familiar voice said, as Twilight plonked yet another book on the finished pile.</p><p class="double">She turned. “Wait, is that <i>Hiccup?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Exactly,” Hiccup said, strolling in. “We&#039;re seeing a lot of one another lately... I&#039;m the Queen&#039;s Own, by the way. That basically means-”</p><p class="double">“You have about the same job I did in my home Loop,” Twilight finished for him.</p><p class="double">“Just about.” Hiccup sat down opposite her. “Any good books?”</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed to one of them. “Good story, interesting ideas for what to try out later this Loop. Did you let Celestia know you&#039;re Looping?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, is she one of yours? And Awake?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and Hiccup frowned.</p><p class="double">“Well, great. She must have been laughing at me all through our meeting... anyway. Toothless is here, too, but he&#039;s a Companion.”</p><p class="double">“So is Luna.”</p><p class="double">“Bet she&#039;s taking it better, though.” Hiccup leaned back in his chair. “It&#039;s all moan whine complain I preferred wings.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight watched as something pulsed in the Grove. By the looks of things, she was about to get a Companion...</p><p class="double"><i>What in the name of me?</i> A familiar mental voice asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Dash?”</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, well spotted...</i> Dash&#039;s mental tone was a bit snippy. <i>Now, why am I an earth pony horse?</p><p class="double"></i>“I assume it&#039;s the rules here.”</p><p class="double"><i>Rules, ha! At least I&#039;m still blue.</p><p class="double"></i></p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight looked up, frowning.</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I just have a... suspicion, about that mission you sent Hiccup on. You know, to that country next door?”</p><p class="double">“I assure you, I know the one.” Celestia said, then tapped her chin. “I wonder what it could be...”</p><p class="double">With a flicker of movement, Toothless – dragon, not Companion – materialized overhead. There were several gasps of surprise, and at least one Herald went for their bow before Twilight and Celestia could tell them to stand down.</p><p class="double">“That was <i>not</i> fun,” Hiccup said, shaking his head. “Hey, did you know the crown prince of that place is a blood mage? Well, I say is... more like was.”</p><p class="double">“What did you do?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Toothless burped.</p><p class="double">“Oh, shut up,” Hiccup said with a grin. “No, Toothless <i>didn&#039;t</i> eat him. We did blow him up a bit, though.”</p><p class="double">“How do you blow someone up a bit?” Celestia asked, concealing a grin.</p><p class="double"><i>I only got his trousers,</i> Toothless explained.</p><p class="double">Twilight steadied herself as Dash began laughing.</p><p class="double">“So, what happens now?” Hiccup asked. “I mean, I&#039;ve got a few ideas, but you&#039;re the one in charge. Apparently.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you.” Celestia closed her eyes for a moment, and Luna beneath her rolled <i>her</i> eyes at some unheard comment.</p><p class="double">“Right. Twilight, how are you doing at adapting your magic here?”</p><p class="double">“Not as well as I could be...” Twilight shrugged. “The magic system here is kind of bizarre, all lines and nodes. But in an emergency I can pull off a work-around.”</p><p class="double">“Please do.” Celestia pointed towards Ancar&#039;s kingdom. “I would like you and Hiccup to give us magical fire support. Non lethal, of course. I think it&#039;s time for a bit of an invasion.”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.” Twilight snapped her fingers, and produced a small bracelet with a coin, like an ancient Athenian Drachma, dangling from it. “Okay, OWL. Set up.”</p><p class="double">The coin flashed, and reshaped into a baton. Set up. Good morning, mistress.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hey, you <i>have</i> got an Intelligent Device,” Hiccup said, interested. “I did wonder...”</p><p class="double">“I hardly ever use him because he&#039;s a bit of a crutch,” Twilight admitted. “It&#039;s more interesting to reverse engineer Nanoha&#039;s spells to fit my own personal magical abilities. But since I haven&#039;t <i>got</i> my personal magic working here yet...”</p><p class="double">“I agree.” Hiccup nodded. “I, on the other hand, have had Raising Dragon for quite a while.”</p><p class="double"><i>Wait,</i> Dash mindspoke slowly. <i>Does this mean we&#039;re going to be the horse archers from Tartarus?</p><p class="double"></i>“Pretty much,” Twilight replied. “Owl, arbalest form.”</p><p class="double">Arbalest mode engaged.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Ancar put his head in his hands. “Where did it all go wrong?”</p><p class="double">“That would be when you declared war on Valdemar, sire,” his chief advisor said helpfully.</p><p class="double">The mage-king had nearly enough time to start throttling his chief advisor, but then the wall exploded inwards and the whole issue became sort of moot.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, that was fun,” Hiccup said. “What now?”</p><p class="double">“Now we relax... unless there&#039;s something <i>else</i> out there to be a problem,” Twilight replied. “I for one am looking forward to more than five years of continuous research without a political job.”</p><p class="double">“Actually,” Celestia said, voice wheedling. “I do have quite a lot of paperwork, and the heir should be experienced at-”</p><p class="double">“No.” Twilight held up a hand, flat with the palm. “Not interested, not listening. I&#039;m going to go research how magic works here.”</p><p class="double">The Queen shook her head. “If you&#039;re sure...”</p><p class="double">“Look, you&#039;ve got Hiccup and Toothless to draw on. They&#039;re older than <i>me.</i> By, well, a few thousand loops, I think...”</p><p class="double">“Stop trying to draw me into this,” Hiccup replied. “Hey, I wonder if I can pass Toothless off as a really big bird? I want into the Hawkbrothers.”</p><p class="double"><i>Bawk bawk?</i> Toothless tried. <i>It doesn&#039;t really fit me...</p><p class="double"></i></p><p><hr></p><p>33.2 (Caution: contains non-MLP headcanon)</p><p><hr></p><p>“Oh, thank you all for coming,” Fluttershy said quietly. “I&#039;m afraid that some of my animals have been acting... <i>very</i> strangely.”</p><p class="double">“And we all know what <i>that</i> means...” Scootaloo muttered.</p><p class="double">“Ssh,” Dash admonished her. “I kinda wanna guess <i>who</i> it is before we get told.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo nodded.</p><p class="double">“So,” Twilight said, brightly. “What alerted you?”</p><p class="double">“Well, it was two things. Mister Hedge and Mister Kiddy got into a race, and... I&#039;m afraid that I lost track of them. I don&#039;t understand it, they&#039;re normally very even tempered...”</p><p class="double">“Why do y&#039;all still give yer animals such cutesy names?” Applebloom asked. “Can&#039;t you talk to &#039;em now?”</p><p class="double">“She can,” Dash answered for her friend. “But we tend to call animals by what they&#039;re called anyway, here in Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“Huh...” Applebloom absorbed that. “Well, that explains some of those stranger fused loops...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, being a tortoise wasn&#039;t as fun as all that. Might explain why Rarity found her cat where she did, though...”</p><p class="double">“Really?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, she rescued Opalescence from a pit where she was planning to look for gems. I kinda think her gem finding spell might have locked on to the cat...”</p><p class="double">Sweetie nodded. “Now I think about it, I <i>do</i> remember that. Mom and Dad were a bit confused.” The filly then stopped, putting a hoof to her chin. “Doesn&#039;t explain why Opal&#039;s such an ungrateful, spiteful-”</p><p class="double">“Sweetie,” Twilight warned.</p><p class="double">“-Molly. What, what did you think I was going to say?” Sweetie winked.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo held up a hoof. “We may have gotten distracted. What was the other thing, Fluttershy?”</p><p class="double">“Well, the only other thing I&#039;d noticed when I left was that Snugglekins had started dismantling my dehumidifier...”</p><p class="double">For a few minutes, there was silence, as all the Loopers tried to solve the problem.</p><p class="double">“Hang on,” Dash said, frowning. “Isn&#039;t Snugglekins that fox-”</p><p class="double">“Sonic!” the Crusaders shouted at once.</p><p class="double">“I should have known!” Sweetie said, shaking her head. “Of course Mister Hedge would have to be a hedgehog!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is going to be awesome!” Applebloom enthused. “I&#039;ve wanted to meet Tails for the longest time!”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, this was a bust,” Applebloom muttered.</p><p class="double">The almost-perfectly-normal fox in front of her cocked his head, then flirted two tails (I did say <i>almost</i>) and got back to building something out of a dehumidifier, half of Fluttershy&#039;s fridge, a phonograph, and her alarm clock.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear...” Fluttershy said softly. “I should have reminded you that you can&#039;t speak with animals...”</p><p class="double">The fox licked something, pressed it onto a circuit board, then wrapped two wires together. A moment&#039;s work with a multimeter (and where that came from Applebloom wasn&#039;t sure, though she had a suspicion) and he slotted a final capacitor into place.</p><p class="double">“Okay, does this work?” asked the voice of an opera singer from Hockland.</p><p class="double">Applebloom blinked, then got it. “Cool, a translator?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” the opera singer continued, as Tails barked quietly into a small gramophone horn. “I&#039;d have been finished sooner, but my stuff in my subspace pocket is all pawprint and iris-locked, and I kind of don&#039;t have the same pawprint.”</p><p class="double">The filly thought about that for a moment, then did the mental equivalent of turning her subspace pocket upside down and shaking it to see what fell out.</p><p class="double">At least one handheld computer did, along with a soldering iron, two printed circuit boards which looked like maps of a tree&#039;s xylem, and a golden metal egg.</p><p class="double">“Whoops,” Applebloom said quickly, sweeping the egg up with a pair of tongs and dumping it back through her mane. “None of that, thank you very much.”</p><p class="double">“Can I use the computer? I mean, is it spare?” the singer asked, in what sounded like the second strangest opera ever written.</p><p class="double">“Sure, go ahead.” Applebloom pushed it over, turning the transmitter on and doing the same on her personal computer. “Not much installed on it... hey, is it weird that I&#039;m barely avoiding fangirling over you?”</p><p class="double">“Kind of...” Tails admitted. “Is it the fuzzy tail?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom promptly picked him up and hugged him.</p><p class="double">Several fox snarl-barks went unanswered, until Fluttershy raised a hoof. “Um... do you want me to translate now?”</p><p class="double">The filly blinked, shook her head, and put Tails gently down. “Sorry about that, mister Prower... the geeky-stuff kind of crossed with the fuzzies and I couldn&#039;t help myself.”</p><p class="double">“At least it&#039;s partly geek stuff...” Tails said via the translator. “Now I know why Dad gets all the girls...”</p><p class="double">“Wait, you have a dad?” Applebloom checked. “I actually didn&#039;t know. It never came up when ah was you.”</p><p class="double">“Sort of. You&#039;re familiar with my world, right? You&#039;re going to laugh...” Tails warned.</p><p class="double">“No, I&#039;m not!” Applebloom protested. “I kinda know about the whole missin&#039; parents thing...”</p><p class="double">“Well, mine isn&#039;t missing. You&#039;d know him as Dr. Ivo Robotnik.”</p><p class="double">Her jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">Tails sat back and shrugged, then went back to the gramophone horn. “I&#039;m actually kind of a genetic experiment, but Dad is Dad as far as I&#039;m concerned. You should see him on the days he&#039;s not going all mad with science, he&#039;s a nice guy.”</p><p class="double">The young fox dragged the palmtop over with a paw, and began typing as he talked. “Anyway. Yeah, that relationship predates the loops, but we kept it secret from Sonic. That&#039;s not exactly hard, you just don&#039;t tell him out loud and he never asks. Then, one day, when I was in my first time looping, he just up and told me he&#039;d found out about it twenty loops ago.”</p><p class="double">A supple shrug-like motion. “Of course, there&#039;s a major branch type for my loop which has me with a dad who gets abducted by aliens instead, or something... I can never keep it straight.”</p><p class="double">The palmtop made a <i>bing</i> noise.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s that?” Applebloom asked, interested.</p><p class="double">By way of reply, Tails yipped into the palmtop while typing. What emerged was far more like his natural voice. “Translator program I designed for handling aliens. Works for this, too.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded. “I think I see. So you got it to absorb our language via my computer&#039;s data storage, and then you&#039;re typing what you say as you say it so it can learn fox.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” Tails nodded. “I can see why you replaced me, nice work!”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well,” Braeburn said, looking into his bottle of whiskey. “Ah think this must be a li&#039;l too strong.”</p><p class="double">There wasn&#039;t really any other explanation than the whiskey for why two pegasi and two hedgehoggy... things, had just shot past his house...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">33.3</p><p><hr></p><p>“Welcome to our town, Twilight Sparkle,” the Mayor said genially.</p><p class="double">“Actually...” Twilight paused, digging in her saddlebags. “I was informed that I&#039;d be staying in the library. It looks nice, and I&#039;ve got, well, a bit of money...” she looked embarassed. “Put it this way, the most I&#039;ve spent it on in years is books. Anyway, I was wondering if it was possible to buy the library?”</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare blinked. “You want to what?”</p><p class="double">“Buy the library. Freehold.” Twilight pulled a bag out of her saddlebags, which clinked. “Here we are! I hope this is enough...”</p><p class="double">Recovering slightly, the Mayor thought it over. Especially important was the size of the bag.</p><p class="double">It <i>would</i> be nice to not be worried about the budget. “Well, if you insist...”</p><p class="double">“I do. Oh, keep the change.” Twilight passed over the bag. Mayor Mare took it, and was unable to keep her grip on it – resulting in a loud <i>thud</i> and a small crater in the ground.</p><p class="double">Both of them looked at the crater.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll fix that later,” Twilight said, blushing. “Anyway. I must be getting on, there&#039;s a bit of work I want to get done.”</p><p class="double">Fortunately, she had come prepared. All the relevant paperwork was already drawn up, filled out and signed by her last Loop – some of it was even already filed, that morning in Canterlot.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“We ought to do something about Nightmare Moon,” Applejack said.</p><p class="double">“Not my problem,” Twilight replied, kicking back on the sofa.</p><p class="double">“What?” came from several throats at once.</p><p class="double">“Well, as I see it, she&#039;s only invading Equestria, right? Not my problem.”</p><p class="double">“Er... we are <i>in</i> Equestria, darling,” Rarity pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Twilight pointed to the door. “Didn&#039;t any of you see the sign?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shot out the door, then back in again. “What does Federal Republic of Libraria mean?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Easy. I established this library, and the land around it to a distance of one fetlock, as an independent micronation. I am the President – for life – and Spike is the only other citizen.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m what?” Spike called from the other room.</p><p class="double">“Dual citizenship,” she called back.</p><p class="double">“Oh, okay then. Wait, I didn&#039;t elect you.”</p><p class="double">“The voting age in Libraria is two years more than your age, Spike,” Twilight replied. “Which leaves me as the only voter. Next election is whenever I step down.”</p><p class="double">“Awww...”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Dash shook her head, looking annoyed. “If you&#039;re going to give up like this, then we don&#039;t need you! We&#039;ll go stop Nightmare Moon by ourselves.”</p><p class="double">“Go ahead,” Twilight replied. Her horn flared as she mixed a mug of cocoa. “I&#039;d like to help, of course, but the Westfillian principle means I can&#039;t intervene in the internal affairs of other nations. This is basically a succession crisis, after all...”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight did feel a little guilty about what happened to her friends.</p><p class="double">Just a bit.</p><p class="double">But, well, the dungeons in Canterlot Castle were frankly a bit pathetic. They just hadn&#039;t been used in a long time... and, of course, Twilight had sent a letter to Cadence about the whole thing, so the young alicorn had broken all five of them out already.</p><p class="double"><i>Right. It&#039;s about six A.M, so...</p><p class="double"></i></p><p><hr></p><p>Nightmare Moon stalked towards the brightly lit tree in the centre of Ponyville. “What treachery is this?”</p><p class="double">“Hi!” a unicorn waved from the top balcony, wearing smoked-glass shades and with a drink next to her. “Cordial greetings from the President of Libraria to the Princess of Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“Why and how do you break the Eternal Night?” Nightmare Moon asked, ignoring the comment.</p><p class="double">The unicorn grinned. “Actually, it&#039;s very interesting. See, it&#039;s a variation of a portal spell, where the portal only transmits light. I parked one end of the portal over open sea on what I suppose should be called the Dayside now, and so it lets through just enough sunlight to cover Libraria.”</p><p class="double">“Your impudence shall be punished!” Charging her horn, Nightmare Moon prepared to make an example of the insolent unicorn.</p><p class="double">“Actually, you <i>really</i> don&#039;t want to do that,” the unicorn replied, taking her sunglasses off. “Basically, if you do, then the Westfillian treaty doesn&#039;t apply any more.”</p><p class="double">The spell stopped charging.</p><p class="double">“The <i>what</i> treaty?” Nightmare Moon asked, frowning. “I know not of such a treaty.”</p><p class="double">“Essentially, it forbids interference in the internal affairs of other countries. And, since I&#039;m President Twilight Sparkle of the micronation of Libraria, that means I can&#039;t get involved in purely internal Equestrian affairs.” The unicorn – Sparkle – tossed over a scroll which Nightmare Moon caught by instinct. “Clause five, I think.”</p><p class="double">The Nightmare read it, slowly and carefully, looking for loopholes.</p><p class="double">“...I see. Well, then, there is just one problem.”</p><p class="double">“Do tell,” the &#039;President&#039; invited cheerfully.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t <i>care</i> if you get involved.” Nightmare Moon finished her spell, and fired it directly at the tree trunk.</p><p class="double">Then there was a flash of almost intolerably bright light.</p><p class="double">“Hello,” the purple alicorn standing in front of her said, as Nightmare Moon&#039;s vision returned. “I&#039;m the commander-in-chief. Also the army.”</p><p class="double">“Where did you come from?” Nightmare asked angrily.</p><p class="double">“Libraria has a system of volunteer service. All adult citizens are on the muster rolls and can be activated at any time-”</p><p class="double">“Well, then, why didn&#039;t I <i>sense</i> you?” The words were ground out through what seemed to be intense anger. “And where did your puling President go?”</p><p class="double">“Speaking,” the alicorn said. “Now, since the treaty no longer applies, I&#039;d like to ask you an important question. What is magic?”</p><p class="double">“I... <i>why?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Just curious,” the alicorn – apparently this Sparkle – said. “After all, it&#039;s sort of fundamental here.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t particularly care either to answer or what the answer is,” Nightmare said, already charging more magic.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m sure Cadence can tell us,” Sparkle said, nodding behind the Nightmare.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the oldest trick in the book!” Nightmare Moon retorted. “I am not a fool.”</p><p class="double">“Friendship is magic!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s ears sagged. “She <i>was</i> behind me, was she not?”</p><p class="double">Sparkle nodded, and then everything went rainbow.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, that was fairly successful,” Twilight said to herself that evening.</p><p class="double">First off, she&#039;d managed to engineer <i>Cadence</i> into being the Element of Magic. It would be interesting to see how that developed.</p><p class="double">Secondly, and much more entertainingly, the paperwork making her library into a micronation was now unassailable. And she was <i>sure</i> there was a lot of humour to be got out of that.</p><p class="double">The only downside was that, while most ponies had believed her that the alicorn was an elaborate illusion, Princess Luna was still on her case about it.</p><p class="double">Ah, well. No new loop pattern worked the first time.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>33.4 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p>Some Awakenings were less pleasant than others. Falling from a great height wasn&#039;t that bad, as long as the height was still great enough to cast a Levitation spell. Fight sequences generally had you so involved that your brain pretty much shunted the whole &#039;millennia of memories&#039; thing to one side until the risk of dying was less immediate. Though additional centuries of combat experience and the massive power boost usually helped.</p><p class="double">On a scale of one to ten, finding yourself in a giant white test tube with a bunch of humans in white coats and either combat androids or soldiers in advanced body armour watching you like a specimen through a large window was definitely a solid seven. Having two disks bigger than you were extruding on mechanical arms to envelop you bumped that to an eight, and the fact that they crackled with electricity made it a nine. Add to that the fact that there was some sort of suppressive field interfering with her attempts to push them away and it was probably a nine point seven.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle stabilised her telekinetic output from her reserves without upping the power to avoid a spike while she assimilated the in-loop memories. Okay, teleport accident, ended up on a n apparently human inhabited planet unconscious from a rough transit, captured by this bunch of paramilitary types. Her memories from the capture were too fuzzy to get anything like an organisation name, but it was quite clear that they&#039;d treated her as hostile from the very first. Attacked from the moment she started to move, captured, drugged and now this. Plus she ached all over. Well, if they wanted to make her an enemy, they were going about it the right way.</p><p class="double">Her force powers were almost completely suppressed, and her innate magical ability was impaired by whatever restraint mechanism they were using. She wasn&#039;t sure if alternative foci to her horn, such as her Hogwarts wand were affected, but it was clear purely technological devices were fine, and so was her sub-space pocket. Giving her surroundings a second glance, she made a mental checklist of the chain of spells she&#039;d be casting, then summoned an EMP bomb.</p><p class="double">Dr Vahlen watched dispassionately as the two electrodes closed in on the research project they&#039;d code-named Sparkle.</p><p class="double">“Load still rising,” the first operator spoke, “scaling up damping field to forty-five per cent… forty-six… forty-seven…”</p><p class="double">“Don’t let it stop the electrodes,” Vahlen commanded, “but continue to monitor the load. We need to know just how powerful this specimen is.”</p><p class="double">Suddenly the lighting flickered and died, along with the screens and the power inside the chamber. The lightning around the two probes died, and they ceased moving. The only light source was the intense purple glow haloing the subject. It flared, especially bright around the &#039;horn&#039;, and then there was a flash of white light and the subject vanished, leaving them in darkness.</p><p class="double">There were screams of panic and shock until the emergency systems cut in and the lights started to come on. The computer systems were a lot less stable, the displays flickering and cycling. The comntainment chamber was defiently empty. The Doctor overcame her shock and triggered her headset. “Case Omega, I repeat Case Omega! We have a containment breach! Subject Sparkle is loose in the base, present whereabouts unknown! Destroy it at any cost!”</p><p class="double">Captain William Walker, call-sign Viking hefted his alloy cannon, while Lieutenant Suchiro Saname, one of the Assault specialists from Strike 2 scanned the area, readying his plasma rifle. The subject had shown considerable ability at deflecting attacks, but with Dr Shen&#039;s psionic damper active, they should have at least a chance of hitting it...</p><p class="double">“Dr Vahlen!” The operator who&#039;d been monitoring the damper spoke. “The damper isn&#039;t functioning, I&#039;ve got an engineering team checking it.”</p><p class="double">He paused, looking up at her with a shocked expression. “It&#039;s wrecked, as if someone put an explosive charge in the middle of it! They&#039;re estimating several hours of work to repair it.”</p><p class="double">The blood of everyone in the lab ran cold, even Dr Vahlen&#039;s which most people believed was ice water anyway. The only equaliser they had against their ex-prisoner was gone, and it was almost certain that the subject was the one responsible, locating and acting against it in a fraction of a second.</p><p class="double">Red lights and sirens were the order of the day, as soldiers and security ran around trying to find the small purple unicorn. This was made redundant when the unicorn reappeared about a foot in front of the Doctor. She was hovering in mid-air, and had manifested wings that glowed with the same lambent violet aura as the rest of her. The small fragment of Dr Vahlen&#039;s mind that wasn&#039;t gibbering with terror noted that they were flapping too slowly to provide the necessary lift.</p><p class="double">Her world disappeared in a hail of alloy fragments and super-heated plasma as the two X-Com soldiers opened fire on the apparition. The attack should have shredded and vapourised the creature, and killed the unarmoured Dr Vahlen herself just from the effects of being on the edges of it, but it seemed to have no effect on either of them. It wasn&#039;t being deflected, simply vanishing when it got within a foot of them.</p><p class="double">It quickly stopped as the two soldiers were flung away, ending up stuck to the walls in a spread-eagled position, with their weapons hung up next to them like display pieces. From the way they were struggling they were both still alive, but unable to free themselves. Doctor Vahlen had other problems, she had tried to scramble away and found herself held gently but immovably as the creature approached.</p><p class="double">It&#039;s big eyes seemed to stare deep into her soul, while the glowing spiral horn, which had appeared so stubby and inoffensive compared to the usual run of claws and mandibles the aliens usually had, looked a lot sharper and more menacing when it was approaching your eyes.</p><p class="double">It brushed her forehead, and she got the sudden impression of a host of voices talking at once, and blurred images inside her head. Then it was over, and the creature retreated. It spoke one word in a feminine voice, then vanished.</p><p class="double">“Thank-you.”</p><p class="double">Commander Banford was still trying to co-ordinate a response to Doctor Vahlen&#039;s Case Omega when subject Sparkle appeared in the command centre, hovering in the centre of the massive holo-projection of earth that dominated it. The projection flickered and went crimson before vanishing altogether. At the same time the few soldiers and security guards who had made it there were borne to the floor, unable to rise, as was anyone who tried to raise a weapon against her.</p><p class="double">The controls for the base communications systems flashed as they opened a base wide channel and locked out further changes, then the hovering creature spoke.</p><p class="double">“I am Twilight Sparkle, protégé to Princess Celestia, the co-ruler of Equestria, student, magical researcher and astronomer. I also know who and what you are, X-Com, as I availed myself of the knowledge and memories of your Doctor Vahlen. Fortunately, unlike your own methods of memory extraction, it doesn&#039;t leave the subject a decerebrated corpse. Apart from a slight aftertaste of elderberries and a temporary decrease in mental acuity comparable to three units of alcohol, she should be back to her mean old self in a few hours.”</p><p class="double">She rolled her eyes and added, “And boy does she ever need a few units of alcohol, and a stallion... I mean, guy. Oh and a spell to lower her inhibitions, I&#039;ve been inside her head and Celestia, that mare is wound tight! I&#039;m not the most social of ponies myself, but she makes me look like Pinkie Pie! Oh, and the reason she&#039;s so into dismembering alien corpses? I think it&#039;s sublimation. Some-pony really needs professional help.”</p><p class="double">She gave a little internal grin. She might not intend to hurt any-pony, but embarrassing the person who&#039;d been quite willing to torture her into a mindless wreck and use her as a target dummy until she expired was perfectly reasonable. She cast a fascination spell with herself as the target to make sure no-pony interrupted.</p><p class="double">“I understand that you have just finished defending yourselves from an alien invasion, and that you&#039;d be naturally cautious about new alien forms, but you never even considered I might not be hostile from the very moment your goons saw me! One moment I was in my observatory in Ponyville, running a series of deep space scrying experiments, the next I ended up on earth, semi-conscious and with a massive everything ache. I could barely keep my magic under control!”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “That&#039;s what I get for using orichalcum rather than mithril to inlay the runes. But you know how it is when you&#039;re on a budget, and really, who would have expected a parametric thaumic cascade using Star Swirl&#039;s second formulation? Should have checked this system was clear of recently evaporated quantum singularities before I tried it...</p><p class="double">“Where was I? Oh yes, helpless and alone on an alien planet, in dire need of a friend and a Spa visit. So your heavy-horseshoe thugs surround me and ignore any attempt I made to communicate. Maybe I wasn&#039;t a hundred percent, but just because my horn was glowing, they didn&#039;t need to bombard me with plasma! Then there&#039;s the whole &#039;torture me into a mindless puppet and use me for target practice&#039; thing you had going. Not the best way to make friends with a representative of a new alien race.”</p><p class="double">She was about to insult them and give them a long winded description of exactly why it was a bad idea to tick off a being who could turn their base into a glowing crater, and had friends who were even more powerful, but she decided that would be too mean spirited. The engrams from that Vahlen female must be making her more aggressive than usual.</p><p class="double">No, it was a cardinal rule of both story telling and teaching to show, not tell. If she was going to troll them, she&#039;d do it pony-style, or rather Twilight style, with random acts of kindness and helping them out. After all, most of them were just trying to protect their world and loved ones, and this rather battered planet needed some major first aid. The trick would be to annoy the Tartarus out of them at the same time.</p><p class="double">“You know what, forget the lot of you! I&#039;m still mad about being experimented on, but I&#039;m not big on vengeance. I could go home right now, but I figure while I&#039;m here, I should take a look around, maybe help out a little. It&#039;s not like your planet couldn&#039;t use all the help it can get. Besides, these &#039;pina coladas&#039; and &#039;Japanese hot springs&#039; Doctor Vahlen&#039;s memories contain interest me greatly. I&#039;ll just pop off a message home telling them what happened, and that I&#039;m going to be home late. Bye bye!”</p><p class="double">She vanished, which broke the spell the watchers were under. It was almost five seconds later that the yelling started.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Casa Manyana wasn&#039;t one of Rio&#039;s most notable drinking establishments. However, Rio, being Rio, especially as even an alien invasion hadn&#039;t stopped the Mardi Gras, it wasn’t unused to unusual sights. A purple alicorn flashing into existence in the middle of the dance floor and making her way to the bar was at least in the top ten.</p><p class="double">Nobody actually moved to try and stop her, partly because she was something of an outside context problem for most of the denizens, and partly because most of them were still trying to decide whether she was real, or just some problem of their own. A few gentle touches of telekinesis to give her a clear path, and a manifested set of steps to bring her level with the bar, and she was facing one of the bar staff.</p><p class="double">“One pina colada please.” The barman looked at her blankly. Twilight face-hooved. Brazil, different language. She hadn&#039;t needed Vahlen&#039;s engrams for the language, English and Equestrian seemed to be interchangeable, but none of her previous loops had given her Portuguese. She cast a universal translation spell.</p><p class="double">“One pina colada please.” The man was still frozen. “C&#039;mon! I&#039;ve been involuntarily teleported halfway across the galaxy, been captured by a secret military organisation, been experimented on, undergone an involuntary evolution into my races most super-powered form, escaped a heavily fortified underground installation, and right now I need a freaking drink!”</p><p class="double">That finally seemed to break the paralysis. Maybe it was the fact her wings flared and her horn had started to glow. “Yes, right away! Do you want a glass or a pitcher?”</p><p class="double">“You do pitchers? I like this planet!” Twilight said brightly. “Yes please!”</p><p class="double">The inanity of the task of making the cocktail calmed him down, and nobody else was willing to prod the purple alien to see what it might do to anyone who interrupted it&#039;s quest for alcohol. He turned back with the pitcher and said automatically, “That will be twenty five reals.”</p><p class="double">He blanched as he suddenly realised what he&#039;d said, but before he could stammer an apology Twilight twitched her head, and a golden coin landed on the counter. “I don&#039;t have any local currency yet, but this coin from my home world is over an ounce of 95 percent pure gold. I&#039;m certain it&#039;s worth several times the value of that drink, even after an exchange fee. Would that be acceptable?”</p><p class="double">Since it was at least a hundred times the value of the drink he had no trouble in agreeing.</p><p class="double">“Great! Keep the change. Oh, could I have some of those little paper umbrellas in it. I understand they&#039;re necessary for the full experience.”</p><p class="double">He added the umbrellas, and found three more coins on the counter. “Oh, and would this be enough to buy the other people here a drink? Just because I&#039;m having a bad day doesn&#039;t mean I want to wish one on any-pony else.”</p><p class="double">It was, easily, and he only hesitated for a brief second to decide not to ask for more. He was already well ahead of the game on the first coin, and given what he&#039;d seen her do when she was in a good mood, he didn&#039;t want to risk what she might do if she found out later that he&#039;d overcharged her. The other bar patrons were cheering. A purple alicorn might be outside their frame of reference, but someone buying them drinks was well inside it, and definitely counted as a friend.</p><p class="double">The purple alicorn in question gave the barman another nod and a pleased smile, levitated the jug with a halo of purple energy, and flashed away as abruptly as she&#039;d appeared. A few seconds later the steps dissolved in a shower of sparkles that faded away to nothing.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile in Japan, a receptionist at a secluded onsen was having difficulty maintaining a suitable level of imperturbability. Part of her was scared of the alien creature that had appeared in the foyer of the hot springs bath towing a jug of something with no visible means of support, while the little girl part of her had taken one look at the adorable purple unicorn with wings and had the deep desire to jump over the counter squealing &#039;Kawaiii!&#039; and hug her.</p><p class="double">“Please could I get a private room, and do you have room service? I&#039;d like a vegetarian sushi selection. And of course, access to the baths. And, most of all, discretion.” Twilight didn&#039;t need a translation spell here. She&#039;d had plenty of loops that had taken her to Japanese or equivalent language settings. She pulled a bag from her subspace pocket and set it on the counter, open enough to show the mass of gold coins and gemstones within. “I believe can pay.”</p><p class="double">Politeness and large sums of gold were acceptable currency anywhere, and Japan was no exception. “I will get the manager. I&#039;m sure he will be happy to see to your needs personally.”</p><p class="double">Twilight levitated a flawless ruby the size of her thumb out of the bag, and placed it in front of her. “Excellent. Thank you for your assistance.”</p><p class="double">She had her drink, a place to stay and get cleaned up, and now she could start to plan...</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>33.5 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><u><b>Ponyville Unconventional</b></u></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“So what do we do about the Foal Free Press?” Apple Bloom asked her Awake crusader buddies.</p><p class="double">“Do we have to do anything?” Sweetie Belle squeaked, looking surprised.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shook her head. “Never gonna do that Gabby Gums thing again. Rainbow Dash took weeks to warm up to me again. Hurting any-pony with gossip like that is just plain wrong.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom looked thoughtful as she paced around the Treehouse. “Of course you&#039;re right, I don&#039;t want to hurt any-pony, but you&#039;ve gotta admit Gabby Gums made ponies sit up and listen. None of us has a cutie-mark talent for writing, unless you count the way Sweetie pulls song lyrics out of the air, but somehow we managed to make it work anyway.</p><p class="double">“I just figure we could do something better than point out that Princess Celestia likes cake. Plus we can even put one over on Diamond Tiara in all her regular snarky, petty tin god minded glory. Why can&#039;t that filly pony on up and stop acting like a spoiled brat? We know she&#039;s better than that, or can be. Maybe by showing her how to help ponies rather than just making fun of them, we can get her to do just that.”</p><p class="double">“What do you have in mind?” Sweetie Belle followed her friend with her eyes.</p><p class="double">“Well, every-pony like to discuss things over an apple juice or something. Let&#039;s give them something to debate. I&#039;ve even got the perfect first topic, assuming Snips and Snails are their usual selves.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“&#039;Snips and Snails in Bubblegum Veils&#039;? I didn&#039;t think the three of you would produce anything usable, but it looks like I was wrong.” Diamond Tiara said grudgingly. “The picture sells it. Ponies always like to see some-pony else being embarrassed. And calling yourselves Gabby Gums, that should help give it some mystery.”</p><p class="double">“Uh, DT... I mean, Miss Editor-in-Chief, ma&#039;am...” Apple Bloom corrected herself as the tiara wearing pony gave her a nasty glare. “That ain&#039;t the whole of it. Look below the fold.”</p><p class="double">“&#039;Right or Wrong – Laughing at some-ponies misfortune is mean.&#039; What is this...” She read through the copy. “... everybody does it... ponies should learn to take a joke... even if it may not seem serious to you, maybe it is to the pony your laughing at... turn the tables, remember something that happened to you and imagine ponies laughing at it... A debate piece? Actually... this is quite good stuff.”</p><p class="double">“We figure we&#039;ll haul the ponies in with the first half, get &#039;em laughing, then buck &#039;em in the face with the question if what they&#039;re doing is right.” Apple Bloom explained.</p><p class="double">“Ponies have all sorts of opinions.” Sweetie Belle added, “Rarity loves to gossip and talk about stuff around town. When she reads this, whether she agrees or not, she will talk about it, and that will get other ponies talking...”</p><p class="double">“And all of them will want copies of the Foal Free Press!” Diamond Tiara finished. “Ha ha ha! It&#039;s brilliant! I&#039;m glad I thought of it... Wait, do you think you can do this again? We need controversy, things ponies can argue about.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t you worry, Chief,” Scootaloo piped up. “We&#039;ve got lots of ideas.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sister, this is intolerable!” Princess Luna stormed into her elder sisters rooms shortly after moon-rise. “We must beagle out the identity of this Gabby Gums is and punish her for her insolence!”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia noticed the papers held crumpled in her sister&#039;s telekinesis and shook her head. “I have to admit, that picture of me sampling the cakes for the Royal Canterlot Bakery Auction wasn&#039;t my most flattering, but I believe I can survive a little fun at my expense.”</p><p class="double">“But... &#039;Celestia – Just like us&#039;? That alone would be bad enough, but this second heading, &#039;Right or Wrong – Is the Diarchy the best way of ruling Equestria&#039;. Tis treason!”</p><p class="double">“Calm yourself Luna.” Princess Celestia gently unfolded the paper. “Have you read it through? This Gabby Gums wasn&#039;t questioning our fitness to rule, she was discussing flaws in the system itself. She actually makes some good points. If anything she is sympathetic to us. She highlights the point that we alone raise the sun and moon, and how that prevents us from taking a holiday, or how if something happened to both of us, how much of a disaster that would be. She even makes the point that you don&#039;t get as much exposure as I do, running the Night Court. You are my younger sister, but you should be my equal in authority. I am giving serious thought to the suggestion she made that we trade off duties. I raised the moon for a thousand years, and I know you could raise the sun. That way you would finally get the respect you deserve.”</p><p class="double">“Sister!” Luna exclaimed, then teared up slightly. “You mean it?”</p><p class="double">“I do. I should have thought of it myself, but my first though was to protect you.” Celestia hugged her sibling. “But most of all, she talks about us as ponies first, rather than princesses. Maybe if more ponies had seen us, seen you that way a thousand years ago and considered even an immortal princess might have hurt feelings, things might have turned out differently.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Have you seen the latest Gabby Gums?” Rainbow Dash asked, as she entered Rarity&#039;s shop.</p><p class="double">“My dear, I read all of Gabby Gums articles.” the fashionista replied as she annealed a gem into place on her latest ensemble. “I assume you&#039;re referring to the one entitled, &#039;Rainbow Dash – Super Speedster or Super Girly&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I don&#039;t know how they got the picture from when I was with you at the Spa. Was I ever steamed when saw that!”</p><p class="double">“Then you read the Right or Wrong piece, am I right?” Rarity smiled.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that kinda put things into perspective. I guess if I can read Daring Doo books without being any less awesome for it, I can get my hooves done too. After all, if I want to look the best for my fans, I&#039;ve gotta take care of myself right? Of course, seeing you were in it too...”</p><p class="double">“I rather liked the tag line, &#039;Can&#039;t a pony be both?&#039;. I don&#039;t know how Gabby Gums learned about my little contretemps with those Diamond Dogs, but it was actually rather flattering to be called a &#039;mare of action&#039; as well as a top fashion designer. It&#039;s like this Gabby Gums knows us both personally.”</p><p class="double">“You think it&#039;s Twilight? After all, she&#039;s always writing reports about everything under the sun. Which reminds me, I can&#039;t believe Princess Luna is subbing for Celestia at that.”</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s a wonderful idea myself, doing the same job for thousands of years must get pretty dull. And Nightmare Night showed Princess Luna needed to get out more.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, you don&#039;t really think of the Princesses as ponies, but they eat cake too I guess. So, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Rarity shook her head. “I wouldn&#039;t have thought she&#039;d write a piece like that about the Princesses, or send a copy of the paper to them afterwards. But I can&#039;t think of any-pony else. I asked Sweetie Belle but she said she&#039;s sworn to secrecy. Actually, I&#039;m meeting up with Fluttershy for another Spa session after I finish this dress. Shall we invite Twilight and see what we can find out?”</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Dash hesitated for a second, then gave a decisive nod. “Okay, and if any-pony gives me a hard time, I&#039;ll buck &#039;em to the curb! For that matter, you can help me, Miss &#039;mare of action&#039;.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I gotta admit, I was plumb furious when I read that headline.” Applejack looked around the breakfast table at her assembled family over an open paper. “I should have figured it was another one of those Gabby Gums tricks. &#039;Applejack – Asleep on the job.&#039; Of course I was resting, I&#039;d just finished bucking the entire South Forty.”</p><p class="double">“Well they did say just that.” Big Mac replied. “Never figured they&#039;d interview a cow to prove it.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom suppressed a smirk and said. “We don&#039;t often talk to the cows on anything, and we&#039;re the ones who maintain their barn!”</p><p class="double">“I figure that was the point sugarcube.” Applejack replied. “It was all a lead into this whole piece about how non-pony races are treated. At least Sweet Apple Acres came out of it looking good.”</p><p class="double">Granny Smith stirred in her rocking chair. “And so we should! I helped my paw talk the Buttercup herd into sticking around Ponyville back in the day. Cows ain&#039;t ponies, they do things their own way, and we ponies better respect that. They like living together, birthing their own calves, and having a secure range to graze on. That&#039;s what we promised &#039;em and that&#039;s what they got. We take care of &#039;em and that includes leavin&#039; them to their own devices.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, it wasn&#039;t just about cows, why do we even say &#039;stubborn as a mule&#039; when old Forest Gumption is as easy going a fellow as any-pony could ask for. Good solid worker too. Or why they only allow ponies in the Royal guard, and that how that whole thing with Zecora happened. She asks some uncomfortable questions, but I guess that&#039;s what makes her popular.”</p><p class="double">“Time some-pony did.” Big Mac was clearly in a chatty mood. “Reckon if no-pony asks if something is wrong, ponies are going to end up thinking it&#039;s right, or not thinking at all!”</p><p class="double">“What I want to know is how this Gabby Gums mare managed to interview them heifers in the first place.” Applejack turned to look at Apple Bloom, who was adding another scoop of chopped apple and honey to her oatmeal. “Bloom, you work on the paper, you must know her. For that matter, you were fixing the plumbing in the cow&#039;s barn yesterday afternoon, was that when she came to visit?”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. “Sorry sis, I made a promise not to tell any-pony. Diamond Tiara won&#039;t let us.”</p><p class="double">Applejack frowned. “That Diamond Tiara&#039;s playing you for a fool. She hasn&#039;t put a single piece by you in the paper, or your friends either.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay sis, there&#039;s more to life than getting your name in the by-line. They need all the help they can get just getting out more copies. We&#039;re delivering to news stands in Canterlot, Trottingham, even Manehattan! We may not get a cutie-mark out of it, but we&#039;re having fun, and ain&#039;t that the important thing?”</p><p class="double">Applejack glowered, not at the filly but at some unseen point in the distance. “I figured that whole business with the cute-caneara was just some silly filly boasting about getting her mark, but the more I hear about her, the less I like. If she gives you trouble, y&#039;all just tell me, y&#039;hear?”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned. “It&#039;s okay sis, we&#039;ve got it under control.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara was livid, and staring down the subjects of her ire from over the top of her desk.</p><p class="double">“Did you really think you&#039;d get away with this? I do read what goes in the paper, your column most of all. This piece about cutie-marks, it&#039;s practically propaganda for your stupid little club! Not to mention the way you make ponies who have an actual gift the bad guys!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s not what it says at all!” Apple Bloom protested. “It&#039;s just saying that while cutie-marks are good, there&#039;s more to a pony than their cutie-mark talent, and that they shouldn&#039;t be bullied about not having a mark. My cousin Babs is having a hard time with bullies at her school, and we reckoned she might not be the only one.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle added her two bits. “We just wanted to let fillies and colts like that know they aren&#039;t alone. Maybe we can even get some grown up ponies to remember how they felt about being bullied about being a blank flank, and even do something to help the foals who are.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, this isn&#039;t about you!” Scootaloo exclaimed. “Your lame attempts at nastiness barely even count as annoying! There are ponies out there who are really hurting!”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t care who&#039;s hurting! You will write something different for your next Gabby Gums piece, or I&#039;ll write my own story, using these! I told Featherweight to photograph everything, and he did!”</p><p class="double">The three of them knew exactly what the pictures showed, Sweetie Belle as a dressmakers dummy, one of Scootaloo&#039;s more spectacular nose dives, and baby Apple Bloom with a pair of diapers on her head. However, they pretended to be appropriately shocked. Featherweight was even visible up in the skylight taking another snap.</p><p class="double">“Hey! Give us those!” Scootaloo reached for the photos, only to have them swiped away and put back in an envelope. Diamond Tiara gave a nasty smirk. “Sorry girls, property of the Foal Free Press... just like Gabby Gums. Now get out there and write!”</p><p class="double">The three fillies trailed out, tails between their legs, heads down, and but with looks that were determined rather than defeated. They&#039;d given her a shot at playing fair, now the horse-shoes went on. Diamond Tiara might think she held all the cards, but they had an ace in the hole.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara came down to breakfast feeling on top of the world. Her brilliant scheme had utterly crushed those three losers. They would continue to produce Gabby Gums columns, starting with tomorrow&#039;s and she would get the credit for it. A win-win situation, as her father liked to call it, and both sides winning were Diamond Tiara.</p><p class="double">She found her father engrossed in the Canterlot Sun Chronicle over the remains of his own breakfast. He lowered the paper to look at her when he heard her enter the room, and that was when she realised something was wrong. His normal fond smile was replaced by a frown.</p><p class="double">“Diamond, what have you been doing at the school newspaper of yours?” he asked her.</p><p class="double">“Pushing it&#039;s circulation through the roof!” she replied, “More is better, you always say.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m fairly certain I didn&#039;t tell you to do this.” He hoofed over the paper. There on the front page were the three &#039;blackmail&#039; pictures she&#039;d used, and a fourth one of her confronting the three fillies in the newspaper office. While you couldn&#039;t see the pictures in detail, you could see three photos scattered on the desk, and it didn&#039;t take a genius to make the connection, especially with everyone&#039;s expressions.</p><p class="double">The headline was, “Editorial or Dictatorial&#039; with a sub heading &#039;When good stories get censored for bad reasons.&#039; and Gabby Gums as the tag line. There was also a note from the Sun Chronicle editor.</p><p class="double">&#039;Gabby Gums is no longer associated with the Foal Free Press, as the story below will relate. We are happy to announce that this is the first of many that will appear in the Chronicle.&#039;</p><p class="double">“Why those little ingrates!” Diamond Tiara raged, “I&#039;ll destroy them! I&#039;ll humiliate them so badly they&#039;ll have to go hide in Zebrica to escape the shame!”</p><p class="double">“With those pictures?” Her father asked sternly, and she suddenly realised he was listening.</p><p class="double">“But daddy, Gabby Gums is my bread and butter! They work for me, and they should do whatever I tell them to!”</p><p class="double">“Apparently not. I suggest you read the article.” She did as he told her, cheeks reddening.</p><p class="double">&#039;You may be wondering why the first three pictures above aren&#039;t accompanied by a snappy commentary and a Right or Wrong follow-up. That&#039;s because of who the three fillies shown here are. Individually we are Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom of Ponyville. Together we are the writing team that uses the pseudonym Gabby Gums.</p><p class="double">It started out as a bit of fun, but we found ponies were actually listening to us. It was awesome, so we used our column to comment on things we saw around us, questions we thought needed asking. As Apple Bloom&#039;s big brother once said, “If no-pony asks if something is wrong, soon every-pony will start thinking it&#039;s right, or not thinking at all.” We might not have gotten on with our Editor-in-Chief, but as long as we were helping to ship newspapers everything was fine.</p><p class="double">Then we wrote our latest column, and she decided she didn&#039;t like it. Not because it was poorly written or badly thought out, but purely on the basis that she believed it reflected badly on her. She ordered us to write something else, and backed it up with the pictures you see above. If we didn&#039;t fill her column inches with our writing, she&#039;d fill it with us, and a write-up designed to humiliate us. Her parting words were that she owned Gabby Gums. However, we&#039;d long since decided that Gabby Gums and getting out the truth was more important than even our individual reputations.</p><p class="double">She thought she had the whip hoof, as she had the only prints and controlled what went into the Foal Free Press. What she didn&#039;t know was that the photographer she&#039;d browbeaten into helping her still had the negatives, and that we&#039;d made contacts with other papers against the possibility that something like this would happen. She may think she owned our work, but we never signed a contract or were ever paid (any money we receive for future columns will be donated to charity).</p><p class="double">As far as we&#039;re concerned, she can publish her photos, and do her worst. The three of us would far rather be remembered as silly fillies for being caught on camera doing something embarrassing than for knuckling under to bullying tactics. We&#039;ll take whatever lumps are coming, we just ask that every-pony remember our very first column.</p><p class="double">As to the piece that caused this ruckus, or possibly even fracas, there isn&#039;t enough room left to publish it. Look for it in our next Gabby Gums column, now appearing in the Canterlot Sun Chronicle, the Baltimare Gazette and the Manehatten Times. We hope for your continued support. Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, writing as Gabby Gums.&#039;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s scream of rage could be heard in Canterlot. </p><p><hr></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>34.1 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><b><hr></b></p><p class="double"><b>Clone Mayhem</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, what have you done?!&quot;</p><p class="double">It was at six in the morning when Celestia teleported outside the Ponyville Library after receiving an urgent request for help from Spike. She had just raised the sun when the scroll begging for her immediate help appeared in a green fire. As soon as she appeared, the problem became apparent immediately. Two ponies stood inside the doorframe, both of their ears drooping against the sides of their heads.</p><p class="double">Oh, and both of them were Twilight Sparkle. The left one&#039;s ears raised as she spoke, &quot;Well...a couple months ago, I was doing some cleaning-&quot;</p><p class="double">The right Sparkle looked at her with a dirty expression, &quot;Wait, I was the one doing the cleaning and I&#039;m the original-&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia stamped her hoof, &quot;It doesn&#039;t matter at the moment. Please continue,&quot; she pointed her hoof at the left Twilight. The pony nodded, &quot;As I said, I, we, were dusting the bookshelves. As we passed the scroll wing of the library, we came across a number of scroll written in a language we had never seen before. We pulled it out and tried performing a translation spell. To our surprise, it didn&#039;t work, or at least, it didn&#039;t translate into Basic Equis!&quot;</p><p class="double">The Twilight on the right lit her horn as a scroll issued from within the library. Celestia took it with her own magic and unfurled it. It was a list of sorts as far as she could tell. Sure enough though, it was in a language she could couldn&#039;t read with words such as &#039;katon&#039; or &#039;ninjutsu&#039;. In addition, it also had pictures of ponies performing magic of some sort. The Twilight on the right continued from the one on the left, &quot;So, part of our project was to translate the words to Equis. We haven&#039;t made much progress on that front.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Twilight on the left shoved the one on the right over, &quot;The other part was performing the magic depicted on the images in front of us. We tried the first,&quot; she said, pointing to the image of one pony becoming two ponies. The foreign language over the picture said:</p><p class="double"><i>Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu</i></p><p class="double">She continued. &quot;And it worked really well! Unfortunately, we don&#039;t quite know how to end the spell. We tried the failsafe spell, and it didn&#039;t quite work.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia sighed, &quot;Twilight, you could have come to me immediately and I would have assisted you in this research. I&#039;m over a thousand years old after all, and have seen many a nation rise and fall. Perhaps if we had researched it together, I could have found some historic records of a civilization like this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pointed at the two of them, &quot;But then, you tried a spell you&#039;ve never heard of before and without knowing the consequences. It could have caused you to blow up for all you know when it made a copy of the pony in the picture.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia gave a stern look, causing both Twilights to drop their heads in shame, both saying together, &quot;We&#039;re sorry, princess...we didn&#039;t think that through all the way. After a moment passed, Celestia&#039;s stern expression faded into a sad smile. She trotted over and hugged one student, then the other, &quot;But you&#039;re alright, and we&#039;ll get through this together.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, the sound of Spike shouting from inside the library caused all of them to look to the entrance, &quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a good idea, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Another voice sounding suspiciously like Twilight&#039;s own echoed from within, &quot;But you just heard the princess. She&#039;ll be able to help us!&quot;</p><p class="double">The Twilight on the right, indeed the original Twilight, started sweating when Celestia&#039;s confused look turned towards the two standing outside, &quot;Well..uh...the thing is...the spell didn&#039;t...quite go according to plan...you see...&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike&#039;s voice echoed again, &quot;No, stay back! All of you! NO! Put me down Twilights!&quot;</p><p class="double">No less than 60 Twilights barrelled out the door with Spike held in one of their auras. Celestia&#039;s face was now in shock. The original continued, &quot;...There may have been an...accident in the magical release...and I may have produced...a few hundred...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eyes gazed over the mass of Twilights as more continued the pour out of the library. Her eyes began twitching as a moment later as her students surrounded her and started speaking at once. As result, she took the only logical action to preserve her sanity and passed out. Silence descended as the Twilights looked on in horror. Then one of the Twilights slapped the original in the back of the head, &quot;Nice going Boss! Now how are we going to explain this to all of Ponyville when they wake up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike maintained his horrified expression for a moment longer, then started chuckling, then laughing, then outright rolling on the floor roaring in amusement as tears poured down his cheeks. Moments later, the dragon shifted from Spike to Discord, &quot;Oh, I haven&#039;t had that much fun in years. Give my thanks to Naruto for teaching you how to do the Shadow Clone technique with your horn only!&quot;</p><p class="double">The original sighed, &quot;Not quite what I had in mind. I meant to have her speechless, not unconscious.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.2</p><p class="double">“...so,” Luna said, holding a bedside lamp. “What does this do?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a lamp, Luna,” Celestia answered kindly. “It makes light through electricity.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, a thunder stone!” Luna nodded. “I see! Well, I know how to work <i>these!”</i></p><p class="double">Celestia was thinking hard. <i>Thunder stone... thunder stone... oh, no!</i> “Luna, wait-”</p><p class="double">Luna quite deliberately dropped the lamp, which hit the floor with a <i>bang</i>. The glass shattered.</p><p class="double">“...because it&#039;s not a thunder stone,” Celestia continued. “It uses electricity which is generated at a dam, and then transmitted by cable to the palace and then to the lamp. You make it work by pressing the switch.”</p><p class="double">“...oh.” Luna hung her head. “My apologies, sister.”</p><p class="double">“Whaa-taa!”</p><p class="double">Both alicorns looked up. “What was that?”</p><p class="double">A cloud of black smoke puffed out from the fireplace, making them both cough.</p><p class="double">“I am, ninja!” somepony shouted, then there was a series of <i>whoosh</i> noises.</p><p class="double">When they had ended, the smoke had gone, there was no sign of soot on the floor or furnishings, and the lamp was neatly reassembled on the dresser.</p><p class="double">Celestia reached up to her ear, which was suddenly itching, and found a black card there. Words in white read:</p><p class="double"><i>Random acts of kindness a speciality!</i></p><p class="double">“...well,” she said, showing Luna the card. “I don&#039;t know about you, Lulu, but I&#039;m not complaining.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Haiii-ya!”</p><p class="double">Cranky Doodle Donkey blinked, and was somewhere else. In fact, he was in a dining room, with a table set for two.</p><p class="double">“What was that?” a voice asked, and-</p><p class="double">Matilda came in through the door, stopped, and put her hoof to her mouth. “Oh!”</p><p class="double">Cranky shrugged. “Don&#039;t know how it happened, but...”</p><p class="double">A black card fluttered to the floor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, this is a new thing for you?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Pinkie nodded, her black outfit somewhat obscuring her identity. (The voice was still obvious, though.)</p><p class="double">“Random acts of kindness, huh? I can see it working. Do you advertise?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked at her like she was an idiot. “No, silly. Ninjas work in shadows!”</p><p class="double">“Which explains the black paper over all your windows, I see...” Twilight nodded absently. “You hiring?”</p><p class="double">“Nope!” Pinkie shook her head. “The fewer ninjas, the better! I can get three times as much work done alone as I could if I had an assistant!” She dug in her subspace pocket. “Oh, hey, I made these!”</p><p class="double">Twilight examined it. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Joke bomb! Like a smoke bomb, but laughing gas. I&#039;ve only tested it once, though, and it didn&#039;t work out like I hoped...”</p><p class="double">“Not surprised...” Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">“It did make Trixie&#039;s show a success, though, so she&#039;s hired me as the opening act.” Pinkie shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Isn&#039;t that a bit unethical?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, she just wants me to gas her. Loads of pratfalls, basically.” Pinkie grinned. “She said it would stink of defeat, were the stink not obscured by the smell of so much money.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a direct quote?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Well, suppose if she&#039;s happy then that&#039;s all to the good. Happy unicorns don&#039;t try to take over Ponyville.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.3</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up. For some reason, this loop, she was an absolutely <i>tiny</i> unicorn – barely a half centimetre tall – but the world itself was fairly interesting. If built for normally sized humans.</p><p class="double">The sky looked marvellous, right now, with the young moon rising into the heavens, and Twilight worked busily on her sketchpad. (She had one this loop, and had decided to keep it up as a hobby. Perhaps it would, one day, let her get a cutie mark that wasn&#039;t the star of magic <i>again.)</i></p><p class="double">Then came the peal of a mighty bell, and the calm air went straight into a screaming, howling storm.</p><p class="double">Twilight was far too small to stay on the ground in that kind of wind. Startled, she went flying, and bounced off a shrine underneath a peach tree. (Fortunately, she ended up out of the wind, and a moment&#039;s work with magic got her pinned down properly.)</p><p class="double">Thus safe, she looked at the shrine...</p><p class="double">Which moved.</p><p class="double">A white alicorn shook her head, bits of stone falling all around her, and turned towards her.</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Twilight said, squinting. “Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, hello, Twilight, I didn&#039;t see you there,” Celestia said, waving a hoof. “I appear to... well, have more or less the same job as normal.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, levitating herself up to eye level with a mage&#039;s blithe disdain for a mere storm. “I see. Does this mean I&#039;m your sidekick?”</p><p class="double">“Probably.” Celestia shrugged, looking herself over. “Well, that&#039;s neat. I like the tufts in my coat... not sure about the black tail tip, though.” She twisted to get a better look at it. “Whoops!”</p><p class="double">The sun came up.</p><p class="double">“...do that again,” Twilight said, blinking.</p><p class="double">The sun came up again, briefly dipping below the horizon only to come up once more. </p><p class="double">“Actually, this is a lot easier than the way I normally do it,” Celestia commented. “I approve.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight hovered over, and took up a seat just behind Celestia&#039;s horn.</p><p class="double">“Are you going to stay there the whole time?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m not going to walk,” Twilight countered.</p><p class="double">“Very well, then. Let us see what this loop is about.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Spike said, handing over a large scroll. “I don&#039;t understand how this works myself, but basically now you can repair things with ink from your tail.”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. “That will be useful. I like the look, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know...” Twilight said critically. “Might be a bit too long and thin for my taste...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you going to help at <i>any</i> point?” Celestia asked, with perhaps a trace of irritation, as she swung a magic mirror like a bludgeon at two imps with guitars.</p><p class="double">Twilight kicked back, hooves wrapped in Celestia&#039;s mane. “I could provide vocals.”</p><p class="double">“I meant help <i>me.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Twilight considered it. “Not especially, no.”</p><p class="double">“...this is payback for the whole Sombra thing, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” the alicorn of the sun muttered. “Giant robot run by a fish. What to do now...”</p><p class="double">Twilight bounced on her head. “Summon the brush goddess of Bloom.”</p><p class="double">“Are you sure?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">Her inky tail moving in a single, precise circle, Celestia called on the magic native to this loop...</p><p class="double">And Fluttershy materialized on the battle field.</p><p class="double">Her eyes narrowed.</p><p class="double">“Mister fishy! You are a bad fish!”</p><p class="double">The whole giant robot of Yami flinched.</p><p class="double">“Okay, now the one for Power Slash.”</p><p class="double">Another flare of magic, and Gilda appeared.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Gilda?” Twilight shouted. “Fancy a fish dinner?”</p><p class="double">The aquiline predator perked up. “Buck yeah!”</p><p class="double">Yami looked from pegasus to griffin (the latter of whom was carrying a very large knife and a napkin)... and jumped off the platform.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not escaping that easily!” Gilda shouted, jumping off after it.</p><p class="double">Celestia and Fluttershy trotted to the edge, and peered down after them.</p><p class="double">“So...” Fluttershy said, after a moment. “Is that it?”</p><p class="double">“I assume so,” Twilight said. “Except for trying to paint an advert on the moon. Now <i>that</i> would restore faith in, er, you.”</p><p class="double">“I may need Luna&#039;s permission...” Celestia mused.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, we&#039;ve been friends for many loops now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn sipped her tea, giving her former teacher a polite, but confused look. &quot;I sense this is going somewhere...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Celestia sighed. &quot;Yes. It&#039;s nothing personal, just... a habit that irks me a bit. I&#039;ve lived with it for a while, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Twilight put her teacup down. &quot;If I&#039;m doing anything to make you uncomfortable, you can tell me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...it&#039;s really rather silly, and it&#039;s not really your fault – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia, don&#039;t make me break out the p-word.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a small laugh out of the alicorn. &quot;You&#039;d really do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. &quot;You&#039;re dancing around the subject, what works works.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...alright.&quot; Setting down her tea and taking a deep breath, the former mentor looked her former student in the eye. &quot;I want you to stop swearing by me.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a quiet moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;....that&#039;s it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to herself. &quot;Huh. Okay. Okay, sure, I&#039;ll... I&#039;ll try – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Also, could you pass the message on to the other loopers? It really is nothing personal, but when you can&#039;t tell if &#039;dear sweet YourOwnName&#039; is an expression of affection it tends to get on your nerves after a while.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, wow. Yeah, I get where you&#039;re coming from, all the Sister loops I did – &quot; The unicorn shook her head. &quot;Wow, I never even thought about it. It was just an unconscious habit. I&#039;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s fine. You didn&#039;t know.&quot;</p><p class="double">They sat amicably for a little while longer.</p><p class="double">&quot;...you know, we&#039;re still going to need to swear occasionally,&quot; Twilight pointed out. &quot;That might cause a bit of a problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Swear by trees,&quot; Celestia suggested. &quot;They&#039;re fairly reliable.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.5</p><p class="double">“Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned, already feeling tired. “What have you rigged to explode this time?”</p><p class="double">Trixie paused, then took out some notes and scribbled on them. “Nothing. Now, if you will excuse me, I need to go replace some hydrogen with helium. If something catches fire, please shout about &#039;oh, the equanity&#039; before coming to help.”</p><p class="double">With that, the blue unicorn left – not quite at a run.</p><p class="double">“Zeppelin?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“I think so,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“Right.”</p><p class="double">“You know what?” Twilight said, not precisely to Spike. “I think I&#039;m going to go get her productively employed on something. Preferably a long way off...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“A moon shot?” Trixie said, looking at the project proposal. “Very interesting, Twilight. Yes, I think this should be a good long term project. Should I work from Apple-loosa, or the Frozen North?”</p><p class="double">“Apple-loosa makes more sense.” Twilight pointed. “You&#039;d have the rail line. Though perhaps set up an day&#039;s canter or so away from any of the actual population centres, since keeping a buffalo tribe and a town-full of pioneers awake at night might not go well. Just put in a spur line, or something.”</p><p class="double">“That is true.” Trixie nodded. “Very well, I shall begin at once!”</p><p class="double">A flash of light, and she was gone.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s dealt with her for a few dozen loops...” Twilight said, then looked upwards with a frown. “Now, what do I do with this Zeppelin?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie trotted happily around her new work site. “Everything is in place! Fuel, launch bunker, control room... all that is needed is the rocket.”</p><p class="double">Picking up some sheet steel in her magical grip, she started an arc-welding spell.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Good enough,” the blue unicorn pronounced. “Now, where&#039;s that tritium...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie carefully wired up the last contact on her control board.</p><p class="double">“Done! Now, can everyone clear the launch area.”</p><p class="double">She chuckled at her own joke. She was the only pony in a hundred miles.</p><p class="double">“Launch in five, four, three, two, one-”</p><p class="double">Trixie hit the firing contact, and nearly tripped over a log on the road. Her wagon behind her didn&#039;t stop as quickly as she did, requiring two awkward half-steps and a skid to stop it overrunning her.</p><p class="double"><i>Hold on a minute...</i> she thought. <i>Where&#039;s the launch pad gone?</i></p><p class="double">A purple flash lit the wooded road in front of her. “Trixie! Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“Fine, thank you, Twilight,” Trixie replied, still frowning. “But someone has stolen my entire launch range.”</p><p class="double">The other unicorn shook her head. “Okay, clearly it all happened too fast. Whatever possessed you to use grav-pinch <i>tritium?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well, Trixie read a very interesting proposal for a project &#039;Orion&#039;, but it used weapons that were far too dirty. So she rebuilt it to use clean fusion weapons...”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “Ce-<i>Tree</i> damnit, you&#039;re myopic sometimes. Project Orion was designed for out-of-atmosphere propulsion, not liftoff!”</p><p class="double">“...oh.” Trixie paused. “So you have been checking for me ever since I blew myself off the face of Equestria?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight replied. “And next time, stick to chemistry. In fact, if you ever start getting involved in nuclear physics again, I may extract a Pinkie Promise.”</p><p class="double">Trixie shuddered. “Understood.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.6</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny kicked the spinner, managing somehow to convey total and utter disdain for all of equinity.</p><p class="double">Quite an erudite rabbit, really.</p><p class="double">“Green,” Fluttershy read off, and moved her left fore hoof carefully to touch a green circle.</p><p class="double">Angel kicked the spinner again.</p><p class="double">“Ooh,” Discord said, squinting. “Feline.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis frowned, and her ears shifted to cat ears.</p><p class="double">Another kick. By now, Angel was reading a book.</p><p class="double">“Blue!”</p><p class="double">Twilight entered the forest clearing. “Hi, guys – okay, what the hay are you all doing?”</p><p class="double">Discord grinned, which was quite impressive, seeing as he currently had the head of a crocodile.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shrugged, awkwardly. “Discord calls it Shape-Twister. Says it&#039;s good practise.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, fair enough. How&#039;s that going, by the way?”</p><p class="double">“Ears and tail, mostly,” Chrysalis admitted. “Biology is hard. Discord finds it easy, though...”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s because I basically ignore it,” Discord stage-whispered, changing his crocodile head back to normal before putting his right arm on red.</p><p class="double">Just the arm. Not the rest of him.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that <i>has</i> to be cheating,” Chrysalis said, scowling. “I – whoa!”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced as pony, changeling and draconequus collapsed in a heap.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.7</p><p class="double">Dash looked over the paper. “Twilight... you sure about this?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Well, organizing things worked so well when I did it at the Winter Wrap-Up, and quite frankly the whole weather schedule seems <i>very</i> complicated – quite unnecessarily, really – so here&#039;s my plan, and I&#039;d like to give it a go.”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Dash looked at her friend askance. “If you say so, Twi. But this ain&#039;t gonna go well.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Dash!” Twilight grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What&#039;s up with the weather, ah ask you...” Applejack muttered to Twilight, as she dragged a cart to market. “Four months o&#039; constant sun! The apples ain&#039;t gonna take much more of this. Let me tell you, ah have half a mind to track down Dash and...”</p><p class="double">Twilight coughed.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, dry throat and all, too,” Applejack said sympathetically.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright, everypony,” Dash said, consulting her chart. “That&#039;s a hundred and twenty-eight days, on the dot, so that&#039;s it for the sunny period.”</p><p class="double">Several pegasi sighed with relief. Derpy had her hooves hooked into a small cloud, and was dangling upside down from it to stay in the shade.</p><p class="double">“What now?” Raindrops asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, according to this plan, we&#039;re past what&#039;s called Garam, and into what&#039;s called Khalif.”</p><p class="double">Silence greeted that announcement.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I dunno either. But it looks like tomorrow is going to be a storm.” Dash flipped onto the next page. “As is the day after. And... hold on a sec, guys.”</p><p class="double">Flip. Flip. Flipflipflipflipflipflipflip...</p><p class="double">“Huh.”</p><p class="double">Thunderlane crowded around to look at the weather plan. “...wait a sec. That&#039;s three and a half months away.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Dash confirmed, contemplating the work ahead. Then clapped her hooves. “Okay, looks like we get to just shove a storm cell on top of Ponyville and keep refilling it for... basically ages.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is not working,” Dash said to Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Yes, thank you, I had gathered that,” Twilight replied, keeping a shield spell over her book collection.</p><p class="double">They had to be shielded. After all, they were on the balcony in pouring rain – because Ponyville was flooding.</p><p class="double"><i>Note to self. Ponyville is not suited for a monsoon climate.</i></p><p class="double">Maybe, rather than just becoming an alicorn on occasion, it would make sense to reverse engineer Star Swirl&#039;s spell and learn how to <i>un</i>transform. If nothing else, she might be able to make it turn her into a pegasus, and clearly learning how the weather worked was going to take practical experience...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Chrysalis sat together in a bar, Chrysalis having a folder in front of her and downing another shot of whisky. Twilight patted her on the back while smiling, &quot;Don&#039;t worry. So, who&#039;s the next person on your list.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis pulled out a set of papers on her next attempt. The image of the pony caused Twilight&#039;s cheerful demeanour to disappear faster than Pinkie when she went to set up her &quot;Welcome to Equestria Party.&quot; Chrysalis opened her mouth to speak, but Twilight lifted the file up with her magic and caused it to burst into flames, &quot;Not him. It won&#039;t work out, I promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked in horror as the ashes fell, &quot;But...he&#039;s a prince like Shining! And also, the papers voted him the most eligible bachelor in Canterlot.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed at the comparison of Shining Armor and Blueblood. Where was looping Rarity when she needed her? She resolved to have the two meet the next time they were looping together.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;we&#039;re going about this wrong.&quot; A smaller, thinner folder floated out of her subspace pocket. &quot;It&#039;s time you move onto a different class of pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen opened the folder cautiously. &quot;...Loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s the one thing we haven&#039;t tried yet...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie blinked.</p><p class="double">She blinked again.</p><p class="double">She took a moment to compose herself. &quot;You... are asking me out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...we are both <i>mares.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis coughed. &quot;Well, technically, you&#039;re a mare and I... don&#039;t actually have ovaries, I just lay the eggs – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, you&#039;re right, stupid me. You&#039;re a shapeshifter! Not a problem.&quot; The unicorn giggled. &quot;Nope, not a problem, I just – why me?&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen bit her lip. &quot;Well... you&#039;re looping... and, you know my, ah, <i>issues</i> with Shining – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, no. No I don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis winced. &quot;...look, it&#039;s complicated, but I&#039;m trying to move on. And – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. I&#039;m a rebound?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No! Not like that – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I cannot believe – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It wasn&#039;t him! It was a not-awake version of him and – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot; – I thought you were actually into me or something – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;GAAAH!&quot; A holey black hoof pressed against Trixie&#039;s muzzle. &quot;Look, I have issues, okay? And it&#039;s been suggested that I try to find another pony, and... I&#039;m doing this wrong. Hold on, let me start over.&quot;</p><p class="double">She took a breath.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Trixie Lulamoon, you have caught my attention, would you give me a chance to catch yours?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn stared at her.</p><p class="double">After a moment, she shook her head. &quot;You know for a species that literally feeds on love, you are terrible at this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My last stable romantic relationship was with an escaped slave of an enemy nation while we were both constantly hunted. I... it kind of just happened, situation... thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie shrugged. &quot;Okay... you know what, okay. Sure. Why not, let&#039;s see where this goes.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.9 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once again, Homura&#039;s eyes flew open. Once again, she rose into a sitting position and sighed. Once again, she had failed Madoka.</p><p class="double">Then she noticed that she was naked. And had hooves.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t scream or boggle at the sight. She&#039;d seen far stranger within witches&#039; barriers. Instead, instincts honed by an endlessly repeated month of struggle had her reaching for her Soul Gem.</p><p class="double">Which she dropped. Because she had hooves.</p><p class="double">Homura took a deep breath. She wasn&#039;t sure what was happening, or why. There was a very real possibility she had gone insane, or had become a witch herself, or both. Still, she could get through this. She had endured far, far worse than fleeting annoyance, and no doubt there was worse yet to come before she could finally rest.</p><p class="double">Still, it would&#039;ve been nice if she hadn&#039;t collapsed <i>immediately</i> after getting out of her hospital bed. Stupid horse legs. Stupid hooves.</p><p class="double">After a few mortifying minutes of learning how to work her new body, Homura realized something that she&#039;d missed while caught up between her usual post-reset depression and the whole horse thing: she didn&#039;t recognize her room. It was different. <i>She</i> was different. If ever there was a chance to save Madoka, this was it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nurse Tenderheart entered the room and beheld one of the chronic patients, a filly who had barely been able to move for years, jumping up and down in joy. The nurse smiled. Such were the miracles of modern medicine. &quot;Congratulations, Daybreak!&quot;</p><p class="double">The purplish-gray little unicorn seemed to halt in midair. Once she landed, she put on a terribly serious, composed expression that did nothing to hide her furious blush. Tenderheart kept a straight face thanks to years of paediatric experience. Checking the clipboard she had in her fetlock helped too. &quot;Now, everything seems to be order. Get your things together and we can get you released.&quot;</p><p class="double">The answer was as stiff as the filly herself. &quot;Y-yes. Thank you. I won&#039;t be long.&quot;</p><p class="double">It was a bit harder for Tenderheart to hold in her laughter this time. She tousled Daybreak&#039;s ebon mane. &quot;Come on, now. No need to embarrassed. This is a big day for you. It&#039;s only natural to get excited.&quot;</p><p class="double">Daybreak&#039;s lips slowly curved into a smile, as if she were afraid her happiness would be taken away the moment she tried to enjoy it. She blinked – were those tears? – and nodded. &quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tenderheart matched her smile for smile. &quot;Attagirl. Come down to the lobby whenever you&#039;re ready.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Homura moved quickly. She needed to. She couldn&#039;t take the chance that Kyuubey wasn&#039;t still plaguing the planet, which meant that she only had about a day to keep a cat from dying. Otherwise, as in that first go-around so long ago, Madoka would resurrect it with her contract wish.</p><p class="double">Luckily, it seemed some part of her remembered this new room as well as she did the usual one, the same part that had spoken English with a fluency she&#039;d only felt in the classroom after a few dozen loops. She knew where everything important was, and in some cases, <i>what</i> it was. The twin pouches were apparently saddlebags, and they were where she stuck the few personal possessions that had made the room more than a place to wait for either recovery or death.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t until she reached her glasses case that she realized that her vision was still blurred. Homura whipped out her Soul Gem with an impatient snort and once again willed her eyes to perfection.</p><p class="double">Once the world came back into focus, she blinked. What she saw didn&#039;t change. Her Soul Gem&#039;s light seemed to have escaped the little jewel and was now surrounding it, making it float in midair. Then she noticed a matching light above her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um…&quot; The Soul Gem drifted back into one of the saddlebags, as if responding to its owner&#039;s unspoken thoughts. The light faded.</p><p class="double">Homura decided to take a quick detour. Old and new memories agreed that the room would have an attached bathroom, which would have a mirror.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Homura moved down the hallway in a mild daze, trusting the strange intuition to guide her to the lobby. She wasn&#039;t sure how to feel about being a unicorn. Deep under the layers of emotional scar tissue, whatever was left of the awkward girl she&#039;d been thought she was absolutely adorable. Another part of her was wondering about the marks on her rump. The diamond she recognized from her fingernail and Soul Gem, and the twisted loop overlaying it seemed to be the symbol for infinity. Her new memories knew it was important, but couldn&#039;t say what it meant. A third was wondering how being a tiny horse would affect her magic. A fourth came back to whether Kyuubey was even here. Would there be any witches to fight? If not, how long could she last if she kept her magic use to a minimum? A fifth…</p><p class="double">Well, in any case, it was entirely understandable when she walked into an adult horse&#039;s legs.</p><p class="double">Homura stumbled back. &quot;Sorry! I wasn&#039;t—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s fine.&quot; The horse – <i>pony</i>, her new knowledge insisted – seemed to be female, given her voice. &quot;I&#039;ve certainly been lost in thought before.&quot; She was also a unicorn, Homura noted, her coat a more vivid shade of purple.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I see you two have met,&quot; said Nurse Tenderheart. &quot;Daybreak, this is Twilight Sparkle. She&#039;ll be looking after you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; A second later, Homura realized she was physically younger than normal. Too young, it seemed, for an apartment of her own. She may not even have the funds available to afford rent.</p><p class="double">The nurse seemed to be expecting her reaction. &quot;I know, Mister Cueball had already volunteered to take you in, but, well, he&#039;s coming in as you&#039;re coming out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s sick?&quot; Homura gave a silent cheer. Sure, the name could be a coincidence, but she was willing to bet all the money she might not actually have that Cueball had red eyes, a white coat, and an obsession with thermodynamics.</p><p class="double">&quot;Injured. Can&#039;t say why. Or won&#039;t.&quot; Tenderheart shook her head. &quot;Stallions. In any case, Miss Sparkle offered to take his place.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded with a grin. &quot;I think we&#039;re going to have a lot of fun, Daybreak.&quot; Her voice had the cheery condescension found in most people&#039;s &quot;talking to children&quot; voice.</p><p class="double">Daybreak Heart. That was her name. Or, at least, it was what everyone… everypony? Seriously? It was what every<i>pony</i> would be calling her. Homura gave a small smile of her own. &quot;I hope so.&quot; She was already devising a plan for getting out from under Twilight&#039;s hooves.</p><p class="double">As the two unicorns walked out of Ponyville General, Homura asked, &quot;How well do you know the ponies here, Miss Sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m no Pinkie Pie, but I&#039;m at least acquainted with quite a few Ponyvillians. Why do you ask?&quot;</p><p class="double">Well, it was worth a shot. Homura considered how Madoka might appear in this timeline. &quot;Would you happen to know a girl about my age? Pink coat, kind to a fault, wears ribbons in her hair?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight considered this for a few steps before shaking her head. &quot;Can&#039;t say I do, but Miss Cheerilee might. She&#039;s going to be your teacher. I can introduce you to her after you&#039;ve gotten settled in.&quot;</p><p class="double">Homura held back a groan. Of course it wouldn&#039;t be that easy. &quot;I see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she a friend?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An old one, but we&#039;ve lost touch.&quot; Homura drooped a bit. &quot;I don&#039;t even remember her name.&quot; Not whatever she was called as a pony, anyway. Strawberry Ribbons, maybe?</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find her soon,&quot; Twilight assured her.</p><p class="double">Homura simply grunted. Empty words were about the best she could expect from adults.</p><p class="double">There was a flash of light, and the filly came to halt, her head darting up. A translucent sphere had sprung up around her, leaving the outside world a bit dulled and blurred, like a light fog.</p><p class="double">&quot;Walk with me, Daybreak.&quot; Twilight&#039;s voice had steel in it now. </p><p class="double">Homura started walking. It seemed like a very bad idea to disobey that voice. She turned to Twilight, whose horn was faintly glowing. &quot;What&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The spell?&quot; Twilight gave a wave of her horn in no particular direction. &quot;It&#039;s a privacy field. Anypony who might be eavesdropping on us will only hear the sort of empty chatter I was subjecting you to until now. The situation? You tell me. About an hour ago, a transequine entity manifested in my house and told me that a temporal energy burst would erupt in the foals&#039; wing of the local hospital, and that I should be there to pick up a very confused filly before she hurt herself or others.&quot;</p><p class="double">At least the mare sounded like she was speaking to an equal now. Still, there was a problem. &quot;I don&#039;t understand,&quot; admitted Homura.</p><p class="double">&quot;Neither do I. I was hoping you could tell me who she might be. She identified herself as &#039;Eternal Hope.&#039; Does that help?&quot;</p><p class="double">Homura shook her head. &quot;Even if I knew her, it wouldn&#039;t be by that name. Do you know of humans?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. &quot;I see. I thought that might be the case. What&#039;s your actual name?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Akemi Homura.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.&quot; Twilight nodded, as though this told her everything she needed to know. &quot;I have a theory. Are you familiar with the term &#039;memory leak&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, if a computer program—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what computers are?&quot; Homura hadn&#039;t seen so much as a pixel since she&#039;d woken up. It was honestly a bit disconcerting.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know a lot of things.&quot; Twilight resumed the lecture. &quot;Anyway, if a computer program requests memory but doesn&#039;t release it, that memory can stay tied up. If the program runs over and over, it leaves more and more memory locked up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Over and over… &quot;Is that why I&#039;m a pony?&quot; Homura asked. &quot;Because I looped too many times?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;No, no. Imagine the leaking program is deleted, but the memory it allocated finds its way to another program that can use it, but has to change the file format… well, the analogy kind of breaks down at that point.&quot;</p><p class="double">Homura wasn&#039;t listening. Her attention had latched onto one word. &quot;Deleted?&quot; She lurched to a halt. &quot;What do you mean, &#039;deleted&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her mouth, but decided against whatever she was going to say before she could say it. &quot;Well, it&#039;s probably best you get the explanation from the best source. We&#039;re here.&quot; She dropped the privacy bubble and opened the library door.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Homura trudged through, too lost in thought to notice that she was walking into a living tree. Her gaze stayed on the floor before her until a pair of hooves came into view. She looked up, her eyes widened, and she dropped onto her haunches, mouth agape.</p><p class="double">Eternal Hope was a full-sized horse, pink as strawberry ice cream. Her mane and tail were cascading streams of energy, shading from magenta at the roots through purple, reaching royal blue by the tips. She had both horn and wings, and her cutie mark was a teardrop overlaid by a fat red X.</p><p class="double">Despite all this, Homura recognized her smile in an instant. &quot;Madoka?&quot;</p><p class="double">Madoka nodded. &quot;Hello again, Homura-chan.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I…&quot; Tears welled in Homura&#039;s eyes, and she wasn&#039;t sure why. &quot;I&#039;m so confused. Are you a magical girl? Are you safe? Is Walpurgis—&quot; She fell silent as wide, pink wings embraced her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shh.&quot; Madoka held her friend in her forelegs. &quot;It&#039;s okay now, Homura-chan. You don&#039;t have to worry about me anymore.&quot; With a chaste kiss to the forehead and a quick spell, she guided the unicorn to sleep.</p><p class="double">Once Homura was resting, Madoka looked up at her hostess and gave her a grateful nod. &quot;Thank you, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; Twilight said sincerely. &quot;Friendship problems are something of a speciality of mine, after all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So it seems.&quot; Madoka&#039;s ears flattened, her smile taking on a melancholy cast. &quot;It&#039;s a shame you won&#039;t remember this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head. &quot;What do you mean? I&#039;m the Anchor of this Loop.&quot; She began casting the first memory spell she could remember, already thinking of others besides.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t leave much of an impression on people. You&#039;ll see when I leave. Or, rather, you won&#039;t.&quot; With no further preamble, the alicorn transformed into pink energy and imploded, taking Homura with her.</p><p class="double">Twilight paused midway through casting Antimony&#039;s Anamnesis Assistant. &quot;Huh. What was I doing?&quot; She pondered for a moment. &quot;Casting a memory spell. And I&#039;ve forgotten what I want to remember. That&#039;s a bit too ironic to be coincidental.&quot; She scowled and extracted a file marked &quot;In Case Of Memory-Proof Entities&quot; from her subspace pocket. &quot;Darn it, and this seemed like it was going to be such a peaceful Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Madoka manifested outside of Yggdrasil in a similar surge of pink, this time in human form. Well, humanoid. To those in the know, the blue marks on her forehead and temples spoke of her divine nature. In her hands she held a brightly shining purple Soul Gem. Homura didn&#039;t need to see how the cosmic sausage was made.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it&#039;s you.&quot; One of the sausage makers happened to be nearby, scowling at the embodiment of hope from her seat in front of the supercomputer.</p><p class="double">Madoka gave a shallow but respectful bow. &quot;Hello, Skuld-senpai.&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld&#039;s scowl deepened. &quot;Don&#039;t &#039;senpai&#039; me, troublemaker. Your haywire ascension has been the biggest headache I&#039;ve had since we had to start the Loops.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;My universe ceasing to exist would cause a magical girl to despair,&quot; answered Madoka. There was a slight singsong aspect to her tone from sheer repetition.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nevertheless, I wasn&#039;t just permitted to preserve it, I had to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever you say, Little Miss Force-of-Nature.&quot; The raven-haired Norn called up a smaller window and cross-referenced the younger goddess&#039;s movements. &quot;So, what should I tell Sleipnir when he finds your fingerprints all over one of his worlds? You know, other than &#039;Here&#039;s my hammer. Go nuts.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I was just cleaning up after myself,&quot; Madoka said with a smile.</p><p class="double">Skuld snorted. &quot;That&#039;d be a first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Madoka shrugged and manifested her bow. The living device extended itself, runic interfaces blooming along its surface. She held the Soul Gem to one, which uploaded the jewel&#039;s data. Homura would be having some odd dreams for a while.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know,&quot; she mused, &quot;I&#039;m no expert, but it seems like you should&#039;ve backed up everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;On what, that twig of yours? You can&#039;t back up a supercomputer on a laptop, and it&#039;s not like we had a grove of server-grade world trees on standby in case of the unthinkable.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you may want to think about that in the future.&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld leapt out of her chair, hovering eye to eye with Madoka, debugging hammer in hand. &quot;<i>You</i> do not get to talk to <i>me</i> about the future!&quot;</p><p class="double">The other goddess didn&#039;t even blink. &quot;Hope is a wish for a better future. Aren&#039;t goddesses supposed to grant wishes?&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld sputtered for a bit, her grip on her hammer tightening to white-knuckle intensity. A dark, especially Norse corner of her mind noted that a good, old-fashioned blood eagle wouldn&#039;t kill a goddess. Not if done properly.</p><p class="double">Ultimately, she huffed a sigh and muttered, &quot;I don&#039;t have time for this.&quot; She returned to her chair and hunched over the console, typing furiously. &quot;<i>Some</i> of us are actually trying to <i>fix</i> this problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll get out of your hair, then.&quot; Once more, Madoka shifted into a plume of pink energy, entering her bow. The world sapling hovered for a moment before vanishing into itself, an ontological paradox only possible with the smaller models.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, Skuld continued to assault her keyboard, muttering divine profanities in commented-out Yggdrasil Command Speech. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a flash, Twilight appeared in the room. &quot;We have a – Oh! I&#039;m sorry, I just, I&#039;ll be going....&quot; She backed out sheepishly, averting her eyes.</p><p class="double">Spike and Rarity shared a look.</p><p class="double">Eventually, the dragon sighed and put down the spatula. &quot;She&#039;s not going to believe we were just making cookies, is she?&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;No, I don&#039;t think so.&quot; Rarity sighed, removing her apron. &quot;To be completely fair, we were licking the batter off each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You started it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, well. Maybe we should go see why she&#039;s here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose,&quot; Spike sighed, taking off his own apron. &quot;I just hope it&#039;s something important...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and that&#039;s it.&quot; Twilight finished awkwardly. &quot;So... um... yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike and Rarity stared at her, eyes wide.</p><p class="double">Eventually, the dragon coughed and took a breath. &quot;So. If I were to flat out say no...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Political explosions, possible war with the dragons and the griffons, a chance that Celestia could be deposed...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And if I say yes, I lose Rarity, marry some stranger, and go rule a nation of jerks.&quot; Spike dragged his hands down his face. &quot;Errrugh. What is with Celestia this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;I think she was banking on being able to shape the dragons into a more agreeable race before you hatched and matured. She&#039;s not awake, so... you know, she didn&#039;t know about...&quot; The unicorn gestured between the two of them.</p><p class="double">Rarity finally managed to gather herself. &quot;Well... you&#039;re a prince though! That&#039;s... okay, that&#039;s no justification whatsoever.&quot; She groaned. &quot;Who arranges marriages centuries ahead of time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And why did it take me centuries to hatch anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. &quot;Dragons this loop hatch when they hatch. You&#039;re an early bloomer.&quot; She levitated over the copy of the treaty. &quot;Anyway, when Celestia heard about you two, she sent me this. If we find a loophole, you guys get to stick together. We&#039;ve got three months. Go.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike cheered, slamming down a lawbook. &quot;Aha! If I choose to abdicate in favour of my cousin, the treaty with the griffons will technically be fulfilled!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Except your only cousin that still qualifies is still in an egg,&quot; Rarity pointed out, &quot;and part of the treaty stipulates renegotiating the trade agreement within a year of coronation.&quot; She sighed, looking up from the genealogies splayed in front of her. &quot;I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to be able to find a peaceful solution to this, Spike. It&#039;s been two and a half months!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve still got half a month, and I am <i>not</i> going to give up on this. I won&#039;t abandon you even if I have to divorce my fiancée after the wedding.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awww... that&#039;s so sweet of you.&quot; The unicorn stood and stepped over to him, giving the dragon a fond nuzzle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t work,&quot; Twilight offered distractedly. &quot;Royal marriages require consummation, at least by these laws.&quot; She remained oblivious of the other two&#039;s glares as she sorted through another stack of books. &quot;Outdated. Doesn&#039;t apply. Doesn&#039;t apply. Outdated. Immoral. Revolutionary. Doesn&#039;t apply. Revolutionary. Doesn&#039;t apply...&quot;</p><p class="double">She stopped suddenly. The book glowing in her magical grip had stopped flipping.</p><p class="double">Spike put a claw on her shoulder. &quot;...Twilight? Did... did you–?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;it&#039;s risky,&quot; she managed. &quot;Dangerously so. Fatal for a normal pony, but...&quot; She let the book levitate over to Rarity. &quot;You might be able to pull it off.&quot;</p><p class="double">The ivory unicorn took the book, reading down the page. &quot;...rather uncouth, don&#039;t you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, well... it&#039;s the only viable option so far.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;I&#039;ll keep looking, but you should start training now.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Selindavri wrapped her tail around Spike&#039;s, draping a blue arm over his shoulders. &quot;Don&#039;t be so nervous, darling.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please... please don&#039;t call me darling.&quot;</p><p class="double">She patted his chest in understanding. &quot;Of course, of course. My big strong drake doesn&#039;t need such frilly nicknames, does he? Relax. In but a few minutes the ceremony will be over and we can move on to... important things.&quot; A gentle smile graced her snout. &quot;I know how hard this is for you, leaving the ponies, but it really is the right thing. And don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ll be able to see them fairly regularly... oh, and of course I will help you adjust to life in the conclave.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike rose an eyecrest, giving her a look. &quot;Really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s why I&#039;m here, da – ironpecs.&quot; Selindavri rapped a fist against him. &quot;Really, though, those <i>are</i> impressive. Ah, that&#039;s our cue.&quot; She patted his shoulder gently and began to walk across the volcanic ash, a serpentine silhouette against the red and gold glow of the lava flows. After steeling himself, Spike walked after her.</p><p class="double">Some accommodations had been made for Spike&#039;s friends of course. The dragons had arranged for an area filled with cooling charms and magical shields repelling the molten rock, where the ponies could watch the glorious wedding of the dragon prince. It was oddly quiet in that region, a contrast to the thrumming of the dragons surrounding the crater. Rainbow Dash and Applejack where fidgeting in their seats. Pinkie and Fluttershy couldn&#039;t help but click their hooves together as they watched.</p><p class="double">Twilight and Rarity seemed oddly calm.</p><p class="double">Finally, the couple stopped in front of a massive dragon, black as the sky with wings large enough to wrap over the entirety of Ponyville. He turned his red eyes on spike, and from him to Selindavri.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm. A match between the line of Horvem and the line of Krin. A portent of things to come, perhaps.&quot; He breathed in, not noticing the significant glance between two unicorns. &quot;Who here would dare object to this match?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was rustling among the watching dragons as Rarity stood. She walked out of the protective circle, horn gleaming as light wrapped tightly around her. Selindavri turned to look at her, surprised and annoyed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I, Rarity Belle, Child of the line of Platinum, claim this match unfit.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I expected opposition,&quot; the blue dragon said, &quot;but not from you.&quot;</p><p class="double">A black claw waved her to silence. &quot;She is within her right to object... should an elder not.&quot; The red eyes scanned the assembled dragons. &quot;Does anybody else challenge this match?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There needs be no other challenge. I invoke the right of claim.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a murmur from the dragons watching the scene. &quot;It&#039;s a trick!&quot; one cried. &quot;She&#039;s a disguised alicorn!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I assure you, my good sir, I do not have access to any such power. I am nothing but a tailor.&quot;</p><p class="double">Selindarvi sighed. &quot;You are a pony, miss Rarity. To fight me is to die, and I do not wish to sully my wedding with an international incident.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then you concede?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I would... refuse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity shook her head sadly. &quot;The line of Horvem has truly fallen to produce a dragon so... frail.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blue dragon narrowed her eyes. &quot;Careful, pony. I am being merciful, and I know how much your kind values that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. We do value mercy. That is why I am invoking Claim instead of Treachery.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mutterings of the dragons behind them ceased at once.</p><p class="double">&quot;An... interesting statement,&quot; rumbled the black behemoth. &quot;A threat, perhaps.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity said nothing.</p><p class="double">Selindavri flicked her tail. &quot;...clear the field. She will have her Claim.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Oh sweet Celestia I&#039;m fighting a dragon.</i></p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s face was the picture of calm as she stared across the lava pit, where Selindavri was meditating. She wasn&#039;t nearly as brutish as the dragon who would take up residence in the mountain every loop; in fact, had circumstances been different Rarity could easily see her as a potential friends. Coupled with her long claws and, to Rarity&#039;s trained eyes, well toned body, the unicorn could only come to one conclusion.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh sweet Celestia I&#039;m fighting a <b>smart</b> dragon.</i></p><p class="double">Then her mind threw up a fact she&#039;d stumbled across during her research.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh sweet Celestia I&#039;m fighting a smart dragon <b>with magic.</b></i></p><p class="double">The unicorn took a deep breath, thankful for the environmental filter spell she&#039;d cast, and let it out. She&#039;d fought smart dragons with magic before, on rare occasions. True, those were usually fused loops, and she was usually an alicorn for those fights, where here she had to avoid becoming an alicorn in order to keep her claim legitimate. Still, this wouldn&#039;t be as hard as it looked. Now if only she could convince the part of her that was a quivering ball of horse of that fact, and concentrate on strategies.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m going to die. I&#039;m going to be immolated. I&#039;m going to cease to be.</i></p><p class="double">Rarity told her instincts to shut the tartarus up, death was temporary and anyway she could easily avoid it.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m going to be torn to bits.</i></p><p class="double">She told them to shut up <i>please</i> she was trying to concentrate.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m going be gobbled up.</i></p><p class="double">With a sigh, she mentally grabbed her instincts by the ear and slapped them repeatedly. This, in retrospect, probably explained the headache.</p><p class="double">The black dragon took a breath. &quot;The time of preparation has ended.&quot;</p><p class="double">Selindavri snapped forward and slammed her magically glowing claws where Rarity had been half a second ago. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jump. Run. Dodge. Cast. Look. Roll. Spell.</p><p class="double">And then, suddenly, Selindavri backed away, tilting her head. &quot;No... you are the smart one, aren&#039;t you? You&#039;re playing to your strengths.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Very well then.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity had less then a second to react before the fire hit her. The blue dragon let out a sigh. &quot;Tactics are important, but power is too.&quot;</p><p class="double">The fire suddenly <i>rippled</i> unnaturally, tightening and compressing until it wrapped around the unicorn in a fanciful, glowing dress. &quot;While I agree, I do think theatrics play a part as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....hmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two women circled cautiously around, now truly assessing each other. Occasionally, Selindavri&#039;s tail would flick a boulder at Rarity; she&#039;d destroy it, naturally, but always did so in a different way. Her return volleys were similarly countered, once by claw, once by wing, once by magic... and then again by claw, but not the same manner as before. The battle had become a series of small, tense tests as the two attempted to get a feel for each other.</p><p class="double">Selindavri suddenly feinted with a claw, so obviously that Rarity was already dodging her snapping jaws – itself another feint as the massive tail wrapped round and flung her into the air.</p><p class="double">With a glow of her horn, gravity was negated. She smiled, lounging in the sky as her flaming dress whipped in the upcurrents of the crater. &quot;I must say, the view is striking from up here! Very powerful. I can see why dragons chose this as a meeting place.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was something of an inspiration to me, actually.&quot; Selindavri nodded back, a small smile on her own face as her wings snapped out. &quot;I&#039;m glad I got to share it with you.&quot; A single flap propelled her toward the hovering pony.</p><p class="double">Of course she wasn&#039;t expecting Rarity to suddenly fall straight at her weighing as much as Cerberus himself.</p><p class="double">When they hit the ground, the unicorn rolled off, glancing at the dragon behind her. Still breathing... and much more surprisingly, attempting to get up. &quot;Are you alright, dear? I don&#039;t actually want to injure you permanently, just convince you to concede.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You... are quite good.&quot; Selindavri shook her head as she stood.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...but not good enough.&quot; The dragon&#039;s neck whipped about, circling them both with fire as she raised her claws and slammed down. Rarity couldn&#039;t help but let out a pained cry when she felt the magic around her being torn away as easily as a sheet of paper. Even with her own admittedly vast stores of power, it would be incredibly difficult to weave a spell without a field of magic around her. Then Selindavri swung a claw at her–</p><p class="double">Technically, her horn was glowing. Technically, she did forge the shield that protected her. Granted, she&#039;d forged it a while ago, in a loop where Mithril could be mail ordered – at a high cost – and she&#039;d just pulled it out of her subspace pocket... but if Selindavri drew the conclusion that she&#039;d just spawned it out of mid air, which judging from her expression she did, then Rarity wasn&#039;t going to correct her.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Why do you want him?&quot; the dragon finally asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I love him,&quot; the unicorn replied simply.</p><p class="double">There was a moment of quiet.</p><p class="double">Then Selindavri shook her head and, with a flap of her wings, put out the ring of fire. &quot;I concede.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity blinked, putting down her shield as her ears perked forward. She&#039;d... honestly expected that to be a lot more difficult.</p><p class="double">The massive black dragon tilted his head, confused as well. &quot;This is an unexpected outcome. Explain.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pride.&quot; Selindavri looked at the ones watching her. &quot;It is not power that drives a dragon. At our core, we are proud creatures. The purest of us, the ones remembered in fame and myth, are the avatars of honor, dignity, and confidence. And ponies, for all their differences, have among them pure hearts as well, but there core lies not in pride, but in love. I would never oppose a dragon whose pride was pure; I would be a fool to not extend that right to any pure heart, even if their purity is one I can never hope to have. And it is clear that in this matter, at the least, Rarity Belle of the line of Platinum has a pure heart.&quot;</p><p class="double">She smiled crookedly. &quot;Aside from which... I will still be an advisor to Spike, no matter the outcome. That is enough for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm.&quot; The elder drake pondered the words. &quot;Very well. Claim has been made, Claim has been taken. If another wishes to make Claim...&quot; His eyes peered at the watching dragons. &quot;Speak.&quot;</p><p class="double">None dared make a sound.</p><p class="double">&quot;....then we will reconvene in a fortnight for a proper union.&quot; And with that, the black drake shut his eyes and let his head rest on the ground, a clear dismissal. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well.&quot; Spike sipped his drink for a moment. &quot;That&#039;s that then.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, it was quite something, wasn&#039;t it?&quot; Rarity shook her head, relaxing on the couch. &quot;This whole fiasco has tired me out, darling, I just hope the rest of this loop&#039;s politics aren&#039;t as crazy as the Platinum Crown loop...&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon raised an eyebrow. &quot;The....?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Before your time. I was doing research on Blueblood for that loop and it turned out his actions were based off a childhood belief that since Celestia was, well, Celestia, he was essentially worthless.&quot; She waved a hoof. &quot;I helped him out, we fell in love, noble families tried to sabotage our relationship to get their hooves on ancient spells... There was the whole thing with Chrysalis, too, I&#039;m still not sure exactly how involved she was.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You fell in love with <i>Blueblood?</i>&quot; Spike sputtered incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Like I said, it was before you started looping. I was incredibly young back then... I thought I&#039;d changed him permanently. I didn&#039;t realize he&#039;d reboot.&quot; The unicorn sighed as her face flushed. &quot;I spent half the next loop a complete wreck. I...&quot; Rarity looked up at Spike, smiling gently. &quot;I&#039;m glad I learned that lesson before you started looping, darling. Don&#039;t hold on to that which is fleeting, but cling to that which truly matters.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike blinked. Then, slowly, he chuckled and shook his head. &quot;Well... thank you. Really, though, Blueblood? I can <i>not</i> figure how that one happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Looking back on it, I think it was just a strange loop. You have no idea how long Twilight teased me about it.&quot; With a dramatic swoon the unicorn fell back into her couch. &quot;And now you know my darkest secret! O please my dear sir, do not think of me less for it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For shame, Lady Belle! For shame!&quot; The dragon waggled a claw. &quot;Naughty, naughty!&quot;</p><p class="double">It only took three seconds for the both of them to collapse in helpless giggles, Rarity moving to make room for Spike to sit down. They leaned into each other, laughing for a good long while. Eventually they managed to collect themselves, looking at each other and sharing a smile.</p><p class="double">Then Spike took a breath. &quot;You know, we&#039;re lucky Cadance is awake this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Rarity tilted her head. &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because she would kill us both if I did what I&#039;m about to do while she wasn&#039;t.&quot; He stood up, wringing his hands.</p><p class="double">The unicorn&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;Spike... are you–?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When I saw you out there,&quot; the dragon began, &quot;I... I saw how you were beautiful even then. Even taking on a full grown dragon, one of the most dangerous and... and let&#039;s face it, dirty things anybody could do, you were absolutely radiant. And it wasn&#039;t just how you looked. It was how you moved... how you acted. You were... amazing. And... I thought about how were all the time, and how much you have given of yourself... Rarity, you&#039;re a wonderful pony. An incredible pony. And seeing you out there... I realized I didn&#039;t want to lose you, even as temporarily as one loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">He reached into his subspace pocket. &quot;Honestly, I&#039;ve been waiting for a loop where we&#039;re <i>all</i> awake. The girls, the princesses, Shining Armor, the Crusaders and their friends, Trixie, Gilda, Chrysalis...&quot; He scoffed a bit. &quot;I doubt Berry would be there even if that would have been nice. But... after this, after coming so close to having to give up the pony I love.... it&#039;s not something I can do.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike knelt down, taking the object in his hand and opening it. &quot;Rarity... will you please do me the honour of letting me claim you forever? Will you please give me the joy of... of becoming my... my wife?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><i>And lo, on that day did appear a smile so radiant that it came not solely from the heart, but from every fibre of the lady&#039;s being. Tears so tightly filled with joy that a single one could hath drowned Chrysalis herself ran freely down her face, a face blushing not from embarrassment but from the overwhelming emotion coursing through her. Her laughter was loud and graceful, dancing through the room in a glorious ballroom waltz which she could not join, for already she had leapt upon her partner and cried a single, pure confirmation. The knight, overwhelmed by his own emotions, could barely slide the ring he had forged and perfected o&#039;r lifetimes onto her waiting hoof before joining in her laughing tears. And they grew close, sharing a single deep kiss that spoke of the most complete union of souls any mortal could hope for.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight walked into the room with a sheaf of papers. &quot;So, I think I&#039;m done with – Oh! I&#039;m sorry, I just, I&#039;ll be going....&quot; She backed out sheepishly, averting her eyes, but a smile danced upon her face. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='35'></a><h3>Halloween Special part 1</h3>
<p>With her usual dexterity, Pinkie Pie opened up her oven and pulled out her latest piping hot creation with her oven-proof hoof mitts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, how does this go?&quot; the pink-coated baking pony though to herself, &quot;There was something about chaos and degenerate suns...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, I&#039;ll just make my own thingy up!&quot; she happily decided, &quot;Oh great bust of Discord, which I have baked out of meringue. Hi! It&#039;s me, Pinkie Pie! Um, please make every pony turn into their costumes for this Nightmare Night, oh and also make sure no pony gets really hurt as a result, because I just want this to be a really fun surprise. If you do this, I will make you a tasty cake and other treats when you get freed from your stone prison-y thing. So I speak-eth, so mote it be. Heh, mote. That&#039;s a funny word. Moat. Moooote. Oh yeah!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie reared up and slammed her front hooves on the table to each side of the meringue statue, channelling as much earth pony magic into the ritual as she could. The sugary bust of Discord started to glow.</p><p class="double">Then she suddenly realized something. &quot;Oh no! My costume! There&#039;s no time to put on the one I wanted, and I don&#039;t have any good ones in my pinkie-storage-space at the moment. I don&#039;t want to take my ascendant form because Twilight could probably figure out what was going on. Oh yeah! I do have costumes hidden all over for just this kind of emergency.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie rushed over to her nearest stash, and then stopped. There were two costumes that she really, really wanted to wear. She whipped her head between them before deciding.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, there were two Pinkie Pies. One started struggling to get into the strange crab-like costume while the other one grabbed the various supplies and accessories and ran into the next room.</p><p class="double">A liberal, if messy application of temporary coat and mane dye, a fake cutie mark sticker, a bit of magic and willpower to straighten her mane and tail, some cardboard and felt wings, and the last bit... Then there was a brief pulse of magic as the tasty statue activated, and it wasn&#039;t Pinkie Pie standing there anymore.</p><p class="double">She looked around in confusion, tried to take a step and stumbled. After regaining her balance, she looked at her hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. I have hooves now? I&#039;m a... horse?&quot; The pony looked around at herself. Cream colored coat, although with a few faint pink splotches.</p><p class="double">She walked up to a nearby mirror and stopped. She had a straight brown mane and tail, but her gaze continued over to her flared wings and horn and, yep, there was a mark on either side of her.</p><p class="double">As she stared at small inkwell and quill, Lauren exclaimed, &quot;I have a cutie mark. I&#039;m a &#039;my little pony&#039;. Why am I not freaking out.. oh wait, there it goes.&quot;</p><p class="double">The new alicorn twitched a few times and collapsed into a shivering ball.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled to herself as she slipped the crablike claws over her front hooves, glancing at her barrel to reassure herself that, yes, the false pair of legs there still clung to her form. It had taken a bit of trickery to figure out how to pull that off; eventually she resorted to a tad of chaos magic in order to keep them from just dangling, which really was rather appropriate. The large pair of thestral wings slumping over her shoulder were counterbalanced by the thick foam tail she&#039;d slipped over her own poofy mange. Of course she had to spraypaint herself and her costume with a special adhesive, before rolling around in coloured powder that was a slightly darker shade of pink then her coat; the end result, though, looked satisfactorily fungal, and she was after all a fun gal to be around.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now for the final addition.&quot; The party pony reached up to her mane, shaking it forward and all about unto her entire face was obscured in a globe of twisted curls. &quot;Ha! Nightmare Night, here I c--&quot;</p><p class="double">Error.</p><p class="double">Shift.</p><p class="double">Chrksxcin twirled its antennae in confusion. This was not the Graceful Realm. If anything, it looked to be a home of a flincher, though the spectrum coming from the objects were varied. How had this individual come here? A stretch of its antennae confirmed that no other Mi-go were in the area... or at least none scenting.</p><p class="double">Something was... disturbing. The idea of something being utterly wrong, of course, was laughable; no Mi-go would ever submit to the idea that something shouldn&#039;t exist, because by existing it obviously should. But disturbing was a reasonable translation to the concept now fluttering through Chrksxcin&#039;s mind. Being alone, save for flinchers... it could possibly handle a small group, but the surroundings indicated a large number, and the lower vibrations did nothing to reassure it.</p><p class="double">With a flick of its wings, Chrksxcin glided to the top of the room, skittering out a convenient window and peering. A mirrorrock was above, although going by the plantlife obviously this world has a flaresphere as well. What confused the Mi-go even more, though, were the flinchers wandering below; more like flincher livestock in form, though obviously as intelligent as the flinchers and with more than a little aetheric manipulation. At the very least they were not looking for it.</p><p class="double">Not enough information. Chrksxcin decided to remain unseen for now, listening and watching.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight awoke the day before Nightmare Night. &quot;Well, this is different. Feels like a standard Loop, but why start this late?&quot;</p><p class="double">She checked her Loop memories more carefully and, finding nothing amiss, she began replanning her costume. As much as she loved her Starswirl costume, it was time for something more fun... especially if she could pass off an ascension as temporary spell work.</p><p class="double">Hopefully, if she was lucky, Rarity was awake and she would be able to get some help with a temporary coat, mane and tail dye. Her own spellwork tended to last longer than she really wanted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia shook her head in confusion. She recognized the Everfree Forest, but she didn&#039;t remember any towns this well-established so near her and ... Luna&#039;s ... castle. Additionally, from the pumpkins scattered around, it was harvest time. She frowned as she recognized the silhouettes of Nightmare Moon pinned in the windows.</p><p class="double">&quot;We thought We&#039;d told Our little ponies not to slander Luna like that...&quot; She paused as she passed a mirror. What had happened to her mane? It was still its normal, desperately soft pink, but why was it cut so strangely? She looked like a librarian, though it did look pretty good with the stripes her mane was beginning to develop as she overworked her magic, raising both her own sun and Luna&#039;s moon...</p><p class="double">Wait. Her connection with the Moon was gone. She glanced up at the rising orb and felt a pang of worry. &quot;Lulu&#039;s back? I&#039;ve got to find her before....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sister?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia spun around, and her heart caught in her throat. Luna was back, and so much taller than... wait, Luna had a full-blown aura in her mane? What?</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s gaze showed her own confusion. &quot;Twilight Sparkle? Your Nightmare Night costume is most splendid, but I would have thought you&#039;d have sent us a letter if you&#039;d ascended.&quot; She chuckled fondly, much as Celestia herself had when one of her little ponies had done something both amusing and amazing. &quot;Come, now, I&#039;m sure Tia will be flattered when we show her. And so proud that you did it without help!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna? What&#039;s going on? Who&#039;s Twilight Sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s good cheer evaporated into concern. &quot;Something is amiss....&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia quailed at the changes all around her. All of their little ponies were deeply bowing to her and her sister and the tall form approaching.</p><p class="double">&quot;M-mother?&quot; Her heart thrilled, and then stilled as the motherly alicorn approached and she saw her own Cutie Mark.</p><p class="double">She began panicking and adjusted the Element of magic on her brow. &quot;I&#039;ve been thrust into the future? I mean, obviously, I get back where I belong, or there wouldn&#039;t be a future to come to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, my faithful student! What a flattering Nightmare Night cost... are those wings real?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, who&#039;s this Twilight everypony keeps saying I am... my daughter? I mean how, if future-me is that tall... how&#039;d I find both the time and the stallion to have a foal?&quot; She couldn&#039;t help noticing the meaningful glance future-Celestia shared with future-Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your Highnesses!&quot; A guard strode in, bearing a filly alicorn on his back. &quot;Something is turning ponies into their Nightmare Night costumes!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia and her older self both turned and sent their magic to examine the filly. Their golden auras commingled, startling her elder self. &quot;Whatever has affected this filly seems to have applied a thaumic cascade resonance via similarity to the paper cone she&#039;d originally had for her costume. More disturbing to me is the fact I can tell her regalia was originally yellow painted cardboard, but it&#039;s now orichalcum. The Thaumic energy costs must be immense just for one shoe alone!&quot;</p><p class="double">Elder Celestia regained her composure, as Luna was keeping the transformed filly entertained. &quot;Alfalfa monster, Luna, really?&quot; She shook her head regally. &quot;I&#039;m frankly more worried about <i>you</i> though. My initial scan tells me that a similar effect is on you, but only to the degree of coat and mane dye being made real.&quot;</p><p class="double">Younger Celestia grimaced. &quot;My plan to get away from the nobles would have worked if they hadn&#039;t knocked my hat off. Nopony would seriously believe a princess would be <i>that</i> pink!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance strode in, looking every inch an Empress. &quot;Have I arrived at a bad time?&quot;</p><p class="double">Younger Celestia boggled. &quot;Oh come on! I can&#039;t believe what made me look ridiculous looks <i>great</i> on her! Who is she anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna looked between the two alicorns of the day, one true and the other ensorcelled. &quot;Tia...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Lulu?&quot; They both replied.</p><p class="double">Luna grit her teeth and attempted the calming exercise her &#039;niece&#039; Cadance had shown her. She raised her hoof to her peytral and took in a deep breath before exhaling and pushing her annoyance away. She then pointed at her actual sister. &quot;For convenience&#039;s sake, I think that I&#039;ll call <i>you</i> Tia...&quot; She turned her hoof to the younger &#039;Celestia.&#039; &quot;... and I&#039;ll call you &#039;Celly.&#039; Do not look at me like that, at least I&#039;m not calling you Sunbutt.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, this will be so much fun.” Letting out a barely audible squeal, Fluttershy finished putting on her wig.</p><p class="double">The rabbit beside her made some snuffling noises.</p><p class="double">“Oh, don’t be such a spoil-sport, Mister Angel Bunny.” Barely containing her elation – which, in combination with the timid pegasus, meant she smiled openly – Fluttershy pulled a druid’s charm out of her sub-space pocket and affixed it inside a midnight-blue-painted cone. “And with this, I can even make my ‘horn’ seem to glow when I am using a spell.”</p><p class="double">Angel gave her a sidelong stare and stamped a foot.</p><p class="double">“No, I promise. Only a few half-stares and some fog or creeping vines.” Lifting her mane out of her face with one wing, she fastened the fake horn to her forehead with the other. “It’s not like I-”</p><p class="double">For a moment, everything seemed to stop, as if the universe itself was taking a deep breath.</p><p class="double">“What is this madness!? Why are we not where we sensed our sister!?” Nightmare Moon whipped her head around to get her bearings. “You there! Tell us where this here place is! NOW!!”</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny looked into his friend’s eyes. <i>Never</i> having seen her frenzied like this, he did the only thing he remembered how to do. He ran.</p><p class="double">“Humph.” Turning around to the mirror in front of her, Nightmare Moon looked herself over. “It seems not only our magical powers have been diminished by a thousand years of banishment.” And in truth, her midnight blue coat seemed dull, the coloration off, like it was mixed with a bit of yellow, and her mane had lost much of its sparkle. “Well, it is of no consequence. Once we find our ‘dear sister’, we shall be the unchallenged ruler of Equestria. AhahahHAHAHAHAA!!” What animals there had been left in Fluttershy’s cabin made a break for it.</p><p class="double">The Mare of the Moon turned up her nose. “Ungrateful boors. Now, where would our sister hide?” Concentrating, she could feel the magic running through her... and then wink out. “What in Tartarus!?” Trying to turn into mist, she charged up, her horn glowing brightly... and then sputtering out. “WE DEMAND THAT THOU WORKEST!!” But again, all that happened was that her horn briefly glowed, after which nothing happened.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon’s left eye twitched. Then she got a hold of herself and a confident smirk spread across her face. “Impressive, dear Tia, we shall give thee that at least.” Turning to the door of the house she seemed to be in, the Mare of Darkness started cantering forward. “But this shall not save thee!” With a sinister laugh, she left the cabin and started moving toward the illuminated town in the distance.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Honestly, Dash, I don&#039;t see why you&#039;re complaining.&quot; Rarity swished her cape to the side as she sidestepped a young foal. &quot;You&#039;re fashionable <i>and</i> terrifying!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus grumbled, her bandaged wings fluttering slightly as she checked the exotic chestplate she wore. &quot;It&#039;s just a little bit confining. I thought I&#039;d get looser wrap.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya do pull off th&#039; Cleopatra look pretty well, though.&quot; Applejack smirked, her teeth unnaturally sharp. &quot;Ya sure ya didn&#039;t have ancestors in the Sphinx Empire or nothing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, it&#039;s been a couple of loops since I checked my family tree.&quot; Rainbow Dash shrugged. &quot;Maybe I do, maybe I don&#039;t. I&#039;ll do some research... later... ish.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m sure my dear Spiky-wikey would be happy to help with that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike smiled, nuzzling Rarity affectionately. &quot;Whatever you say, Mistress...&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn blushed. &quot;Spike! We&#039;re in public!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, just getting into character.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack gave a saucy whistle, which set Rainbow off giggling. Rarity shot them an annoyed look before turning back to the dragon. &quot;In that case, I might just have to suck your blood, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a smile out of Spike. &quot;Your wish is my command, Mistress.&quot; He managed to keep a straight face as Rarity turned red... before suddenly cracking up. &quot;Alright, alright. I&#039;ll lay off. Besides, I promised Twilight I&#039;d see who she dressed up as. I&#039;ll catch up with you gals later!&quot; With a wave of his shackled claws, the dragon walked away.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still, hahaha, can&#039;t believe you got him to dress up like that,&quot; Rainbow gasped, panting for breath. &quot;I don&#039;t, hahahah, don&#039;t know what you were thinking...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Ah&#039;m pretty dang sure she was thinking bout how sexy he&#039;d look as a genie,&quot; Applejack commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pfffhahahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity rolled her eyes, although her face was flushing uncontrollably. &quot;Honestly, Applejack, just because you decided to relive the pet loop doesn&#039;t mean you need to be so feral.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmpony waved a false paw. &quot;Yer right. Ah shouldn&#039;t leap on them sort of comments just cause Ah&#039;m a wild animal.&quot; Her smile widened. &quot;But yer just giving me so much opportunity--&quot;</p><p class="double">And then the world shifted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lady Belle would have recoiled if she&#039;d been a lesser being. As it was, her muzzle merely crinkled in disgust at the foul creature in front of her. &quot;What are you doing in my presence?&quot;</p><p class="double">The feral creature growled and raised its hackles, clearly disliking her as much as she disliked it.</p><p class="double">Then a third presence made itself known. &quot;يا شباب؟ ما أنت -؟ على عقد، ما هيك أنا أقول؟&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hey, guys? What are you--? Hold on, what the heck am I saying?</span></p><p class="double">Both of them turned to a rotted, decrepit creature covered in bandages and golden armor. Lady Belle raised an eyebrow. &quot;And what manner of being are you? Dressed as death, yet I feel great power...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;يا هيا الندرة، كما تعلمون لي! قمت بها هذا الزي! على محمل الجد، ما هيك أنا أقول؟&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Oh come on Rarity, you know me! You made this costume! Seriously, what the heck am I saying?</span></p><p class="double">The strange creature winced as the wolf pony snarled at her. Lady Belle shook her head at the foreign babble. &quot;So long as you do not interfere with me or mine, I have no quarrel with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her eyes narrowed as she turned to the orange beast. &quot;This one, however, is a plague on the night. If it does not submit, I will be forced to teach it... respect.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Derpy donned her costume, all five bags of it. It was, in her opinion, devastatingly clever. By using common household items as garments, she refuted the bourgeoisie preconceptions of what garments could be, forcing ponies to take a hard, unflinching look at the role clothing played in a society of habitual nudists. It transcended the base fright of ghouls and goblins, instead presenting the viewer with a deeper, more existential terror, the kind that only the satirist could inflict.</p><p class="double">Dinky was going as a firepony. She&#039;d certainly gotten enough experience when her mom got too high-concept in the kitchen for her own good.</p><p class="double">Derpy waved as Dinky joined her friends.&quot;Have fun, Muffin! Don&#039;t talk to strangers! Momento mori!&quot; A bit grim, perhaps, but nothing kept a filly from Crusader-level foolishness like reminding her of her morality.</p><p class="double">As the herd of sugar-seeking foals galloped off, the world <i>twisted</i> for a moment.</p><p class="double">After a moment of ontological confusion, Derpy found herself holding the bag she&#039;d perched atop her mane... except she&#039;d never written anything on it. The paper was supposed to be a blank canvas on which onlookers could project their insecurities. Instead, scribbled in what looked like correction fluid and smelled like marzipan, were the words &quot;I don&#039;t get it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fillystine.&quot; Derpy threw the bag to the ground in disgust. Or tried to. It was a paper bag.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, ma&#039;am.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot; Derpy looked up from her discarded headgear only to stop halfway. A tiny firepony stood before her. Not a filly in a cheap costume, but one outfitted in half-scale replicas of rescue worker gear, complete with smudges of soot and the smell of smoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Could you tell me where I am?&quot; asked the pint-sized impossibility. &quot;Last I remember, I was getting back to the station, and now everything&#039;s huge.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy fainted. She would later argue it was the only rational course of action.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Cutie-mark Crusaders were making their own arrangements for Nightmare Night. They had gathered in the Treehouse and were getting into their costumes.</p><p class="double">“I wish we could have done the three pony leaders, not the advisors...” Sweetie Belle said, adjusting her cloak. “Rarity could have helped me make an awesome Princess Platinum costume.”</p><p class="double">“Uh huh, no way I was doing Chancellor Puddinghead,” Apple Bloom shot back, adjusting her hat. “Besides, Diamond Tiara did Princess Platinum last year. And Clover the Clever is pretty cool.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn across from her wrinkled her muzzle at the reminder of why she hadn&#039;t gone princess.</p><p class="double">“Hmph!” Scootaloo looked out from under her crested helmet. “It&#039;s okay for you two, Clover the Clever and Smart Cookie are both great characters. I&#039;m stuck being Private Pansy.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. “You do know that Fluttershy was playing her a lot more timidly than most versions? She was Commander Hurricane&#039;s bat-pony, and effectively his aide.”</p><p class="double">“Mmmm.” Scootaloo&#039;s eyes grew distant, re-imagining Private Pansy with a black cloak and cowl, silhouetted against a skyline. “I wonder if it&#039;s too late to put together a thestral costume... Wait, Commander Hurricane was a guy?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s what I heard.” Apple Bloom replied. “Twilight was talking with Miss Cheerilee about doing our own Hearth&#039;s Warming Eve pageant as a school play and I overheard. Seems doing the play at Canterlot last year got her interested in the story...”</p><p class="double">“Well we&#039;ve got Nightmare Night to get through first!” Sweetie Belle exclaimed. “The fire of friendship may live in our hearts, but I&#039;m more interested in lots of candy living in my stomach!”</p><p class="double">There was a ripple of discontinuity, which none of the trio noticed.</p><p class="double">“Pansy, Cookie? What just happened?” Clover the Clever shook her head to clear it. “For that matter, how did we get here, wherever here is!”</p><p class="double">“Well &#039;here&#039; looks to be some sort of wood cabin, up in a tree unless I miss my guess. Well used too. I&#039;d have said earth-pony, excepting the fine paper some-pony used for that scrawled map on the wall. And whatever happened turned us into fillies and messed with our memories!</p><p class="double">“I remember... stuff, the Fumblewinter, the Exodus, fighting the Windigoes, our meetings to hammer out the Alliance, trying to organise things and get the new towns like Mane Hat and that mining camp in the Canter Lots mountains set up. But when I try to remember how we got here, I draw a blank.”</p><p class="double">Lieutenant Pansy was already checking the windows and door, cautiously, as was her nature. She hadn&#039;t said anything, just went to work making sure no-pony was eavesdropping. Having completed the circuit, she came over to the other two. “I believe the area is secure, from eavesdroppers at least.”</p><p class="double">Clover&#039;s horn sparked and spluttered, than glowed feebly. “Argh! Whatever they did affected my magic. It&#039;s barely active – whatever effect de-aged us, it altered our abilities to match our new ages. But there aren&#039;t any scrying spells in the immediate area, that much I can tell.”</p><p class="double">“You thinking what I&#039;m thinking, Pansy?” Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">Compared to Commander Hurricane, or as the trio liked to call him in private &#039;the Great Bag of Wind&#039;, Pansy might seem diffident. But that retiring nature concealed a first class brain, skilled in tactics and strategy. Hence the name Pensee, which meant &#039;thought&#039; in an old dialect. “It&#039;s safe to assume that whoever, or whatever did this did not have our best interests at heart.”</p><p class="double">“Then we&#039;re all in agreement.” Clover nodded. “The &#039;how&#039; would require a group of unicorns working in concert to cast such a powerful spell. It&#039;s possible earth-pony magic could affect our growth, but our memories? Only unicorn magic could do that.”</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie gave a deep sigh and started pacing, as she often did when talking through a problem. “Chancellor Puddinghead anticipated some sort of reaction from some of the old guard unicorn nobles when the Council of Tribes put forward the newest proposals, but not this. If only forging the Fire of Friendship had burned away the old enmities along with the Windigoes.</p><p class="double">“But it isn&#039;t that easy. The great mass of all three tribes look to us as their saviors, and the ones who keep the Windigoes at bay. They are willing to follow our lead and let the Fire of Friendship into their hearts, or at least lay the kindling. But in too many hearts there is only the empty hearth of despair, or a hearth choked with the bitter ashes of hatred, or the bright flames of greed and envy, leaving no fuel for friendship to ignite...”</p><p class="double">“Smarty, you&#039;re preaching to the choir...” Clover interjected, to stop her friend&#039;s familiar rant. Smart Cookie was the politician of the trio, but that sometimes lead to speech-making even when with her friends.</p><p class="double">“Take us out of the political equation, and the old power blocks would have a chance to restore their power. Too many of the older, more powerful unicorns and pegasi find the new &#039;uppity&#039; earth ponies sit ill with them, as well as cordially hating each other. Even some earth ponies would be happy to see us gone, as they don&#039;t want equality, they want their own shot at being top of the pile, at vengeance for the generations of serfdom to the other races.</p><p class="double">“So even though you say it was unicorns that did the deed, the masterminds behind it could be from any or all of the three races. They might hate each other, but they might be willing to ally to stop us, figuring to diddle the other two later.”</p><p class="double">“I know Commander Hurricane isn&#039;t happy about the alliance, but I&#039;ve managed to keep him sweet so far by telling him how his decisive leadership makes him admired by the troops.” Pansy got a thoughtful look. “But if they wanted to remove us, why not just kill us? Why simply de-age us, but leave us with our memories?”</p><p class="double">“Maybe they made a mistake.” Clover said excitedly. “Think about it. Even if they wiped our memories back to our filly days, the bond of our friendship would still be there. Starswirl is certain that bonds can exist between ponies, even if the memories that created them are absent. So they could have us hidden away somewhere, brought up as friends from foal-hood, and all the while our friendship would provide the power to keep the Windigoes away. They&#039;d have the advantages of the Fire of Friendship without our inconvenient presence in the political arena.</p><p class="double">“However, the friendship bond between us may have shielded our long term memories, the memories of us becoming friends, and everything connected to it. The spell probably suppressed them and wiped out our short term memory, but our true selves came bubbling back up after a time. This is probably some way-point on the way to wherever we were being sent. That&#039;s probably why there&#039;s no guard. Three amnesiac foals aren&#039;t likely to go anywhere.”</p><p class="double">“So, escape, intelligence gathering, and then we hunt down whoever did this!” Pansy said, looking uncharacteristically fierce.</p><p class="double">“We can count on Chancellor Puddinghead for aid.” Smart Cookie stated. “If we can get to him without tipping our hoof.”</p><p class="double">“It sounds like a plan to me.” Clover said in agreement. “If we can get a message to my mentor, I&#039;m sure he can help us reverse the ageing spell. I know for certain that he wouldn&#039;t be a party to this scheme.”</p><p class="double">They headed out of the tree-house and Pansy tried to fly down, only to find that her wings didn&#039;t work properly. The best she could managed was a steep glide. She grimaced as she landed heavily, and called up to the other two. “Clever. They didn&#039;t want me flying to get help if my filly self panicked.”</p><p class="double">Clover joined her on the ground. “I saw a town from the balcony. There seemed to be a lot of lights for this late in the evening, coloured ones too. I suggest we go there first, we can get lost in the mass of ponies – especially if, as I suspect, there&#039;s some sort of festival going on.”</p><p class="double">“Well, we won&#039;t get any older standing here...” Smart Cookie said, then face-hooved. “You know what I mean!”</p><p class="double">The mistake was probably deliberate, but it still made her companions smile, which was almost certainly the idea. She wasn&#039;t called Smart Cookie for nothing. With their spirits lifted, the three trooped down into Ponyville.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The cream coloured alicorn extended herself out of the fetal ball position and ambled over to the nearest couch.</p><p class="double">&quot;Get a hold of yourself, Lauren. I&#039;m sure being a naked pony is some sort of strange dream or vision quest I&#039;m having due to the days of brainstorming to find a way to reboot that old cartoon without turning ponies into superheros,&quot; the mare glanced out of the window only to see an odd pony agilely hopping along the rooftops. It was dressed in a costume that could only be described as a fusion between batman&#039;s and darkwing duck&#039;s.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not helping!&quot; she shouted ineffectually at what could only be her subconscious delusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;So even if this is just some crazy dream, it does feel very real. Oh wait,&quot; the alicorn looked around frantically before spotting a discarded newspaper. She rushed over, picked it up, and stared at the articles.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! I can&#039;t read any of this. You&#039;re not supposed to be able to read in your dream, right? Or was that just a plot of a movie I saw? The point is that I&#039;m not crazy!&quot; Lauren smiled.</p><p class="double">Then the smile faded with a realization, &quot;Okay, I&#039;m going to take a mulligan on the whole talking to myself thing that I&#039;ve been doing, but I&#039;m still not crazy. Right?&quot; she asked a small alligator that had crawled up onto a couch cushion. Said alligator just blinked asymmetrically and slowly opened up his mouth, which was lacking any teeth whatsoever.</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you know? You&#039;re probably just a symbol of.. of my unfounded fears or something like that. Well I&#039;ll show you, you toothless fear-gator. I&#039;ll head right on outside and into this dreamworld.&quot; The alicorn swiftly trotted over to the door and opened it up on... complete pandemonium. A group of ponies were battling a mummy pony, a vampire pony, and a werewolf pony. None of them sparkled. Up on a nearby rooftop, a strange but somehow very familiar winged fungal crab creature scuttled across and out of sight.</p><p class="double">The front door slammed shut.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, I can do this. If I can handle screaming Powerpuff Girl fans at a convention, I can do this.&quot; Once again the door opened, but this time the alicorn pony stepped out into the chaos.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, you can do anything you want in a dream. That means...&quot; Lauren grinned as she flew upwards, her wings flapping instinctively, &quot;I take it all back. Flying is awesome! This is the best dream... well, the second best naked dream ever!&quot;</p><p class="double">Higher she flew. There were enough pegasi and other flying creatures in the air, that she wasn&#039;t noticed or stared at all that much. The alicorn set down in a peaceful corner of an orchard, near a child&#039;s tree house. That peace was interrupted when three fillies emerged slowly from the surounding trees and approached her.</p><p class="double">&quot;We mean you no harm. Who are you and what manner of pony has wings and a horn?&quot; said the small wingless, hornless pony cautiously. Whatever reactions the three fillies were expecting out of the strange winged unicorn, a girlish squeal wasn&#039;t one of them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the three got closer, Smart Cookie looked down at her clothes and up at the other two and rubber her chin with a hoof. “Huh, I’m wondering if we shouldn’t disguise ourselves. Change our clothes about and our manes. A pegasus filly wearing armour is definitely going to attract attention at least.”</p><p class="double">“A lot of the younger ponies are going around without anything at all, now that we no longer have to protect ourselves from the cold of Fumblewinter. I’ve done it a time or two myself.” Clover mused. “It felt… odd the first time, but it’s quite liberating once you’ve gotten used to it.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm… our emblems are not well known, but if there’s someone from the conspiracy in town, they may recognise them. Do you have enough magic in that horn to disguise them?”</p><p class="double">“That much I can do. I only have the power for cantrips, but I know quite a few that could be useful, including a cosmetic spell to change fur colour. It won’t hide them for long, but it’ll do the job.”</p><p class="double">Pansy was already removing her kirtle, but stopped and said in a strained voice, “I don’t think that will be necessary.”</p><p class="double">She showed her bare flank. The other two immediately checked their own hindquarters to the same result. Smart Cookie gave a strangled gasp, while Clover looked dumbstruck, and stuttered, “But that’s… impossible! Even if we were de-aged, we still have our memories, our knowledge. An emblem is connected to the pony’s spirit, not their body! I helped Starswirl do the research. This must be a side effect of the memory spell, but it would have to be very powerful to affect our souls as well as our memories.”</p><p class="double">“Another thing to fix, but at least it solves our immediate problem,” Pansy finally managed. “But I think we should wait until we can see the local ponies directly before we get changed. Speaking of which, this orchard seems awfully large.”</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie nodded, focussing on that to overcome the shock. “True, I don’t remember any this large or well developed in our latest survey, and look at the spacing of the trees, they were planted, not a natural orchard some-pony found.”</p><p class="double">They reached the edge of the orchard, and looked out over the town. There were yells and screams, and the impression of a lot of running about. “Maybe we won’t need to change clothing, it sounds like a wild party down there.”</p><p class="double">“More like a riot…” Pansy pointed at the sky. Look at all the pegasi in the sky, but why aren’t they in armour?”</p><p class="double">“And what is that!” Smart Cookie’s eyes widened as something approached, flying down towards the orchard, a pegasus as big as any they’d ever seen and oddly proportioned. “Take cover!”</p><p class="double">They did so and observed it as it landed, which only increased their confusion. It had an impressive horn, and an ink bottle and quill as an emblem.</p><p class="double">“A winged unicorn?” Clover said quietly, looking incredulous.</p><p class="double">Pansy smirked and whispered. “Or a Pegasus with a horn.”</p><p class="double">“Or a… okay, I’ve got nothing!” Smart Cookie quipped, but keeping her voice as low as the other two. “At least she doesn’t look hostile. And I can’t imagine any scenario where something like that would be allied with a conspiracy to keep the tribes separate. We need information, and she may be able to provide it.”</p><p class="double">They emerged from their hiding place and approached slowly, Smart Cookie in the lead. “We mean you no harm. Who are you and what manner of pony has wings and a horn?”</p><p class="double">Whatever reactions the three fillies were expecting out of the strange winged unicorn, a girlish squeal wasn&#039;t one of them.</p><p class="double">&quot;You three are adorable! You must be the dream representations of Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup.&quot;</p><p class="double">The fillies looked at each other in confusion. The earth pony spoke up again, &quot;We do not know any pony with those names.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren thought for a moment and asked, &quot;Do you know any ponies named Firefly, Posey, Sparkler, Surprise, Twilight, or Applejack?&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies shook their heads, up until the name &#039;Applejack&#039; came up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, we know of an Applejack. She&#039;s an earth pony who runs the &#039;Falling Apple&#039; tavern and inn. Makes great homemade liquor. But the rest of the names you mentioned are not familiar. And as I said, we have never seen a pony like yourself. &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The night shall rule forever!&quot; said a dark pony with a dark flowing mane, wings, and a horn as she flew by. Unlike Lauren&#039;s horn, this pony&#039;s horn was sputtering ineffectually, &quot;Why won&#039;t thy work right? What insidious curse did my own sister do to my magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No matter, I shall triumph despite this handicap!&quot; the dark pony said triumphantly right before she flew into a tree, &quot;Ow! I had believed that I was more able at flying than this. Truly, this is a fell curse Celestia has afflicted upon me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rubbing her forehead, the dark pony slowly flew away. Lauren pointed at the direction the other alicorn was heading.</p><p class="double">The three fillies looked at each other before Smart Cookie answered, &quot;We have never seen that pony before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t care about that,&quot; Lauren said, &quot;Is she trademarked? I think I just found the first season villain for my new show.&quot;</p><p class="double">“You are a writer, a playwright?” Clover asked, “I thought you might be from your emblem. But I do not think that pony was marked for a trade… A crescent moon emblem often implies some-pony skilled in magic, but she had the look of a pegasus warrior, and we heard her curse her lack of magical power. What’s more it sounds like she was using that modern slang that young ponies are affecting, badly. Even I know it should be ‘thou’, not ‘thy’.”</p><p class="double">Pansy snorted. “Any warrior that clumsy wouldn’t last a week. But we should be talking to the horned pegasus who didn’t fly off… stratus! We need a better name for ponies like her since they seem to be popping up all over the place.”</p><p class="double">“Alicorn?” Clover suggested. “She has traits of ‘all’ of us, after all.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe she has a name for her race as well as herself.” Smart Cookie suggested. “Maybe we should introduce ourselves first. I am Smart Cookie, advisor to Chancellor Puddinghead, leader of the earth ponies.”</p><p class="double">The other two agreed. “Clover the Clever, apprentice to Starswirl the Bearded and, a tutor and advisor to Princess Platinum of the unicorns.”</p><p class="double">“Lieutenant Pansy, aide-de-camp to Commander Hurricane of the pegasi. And I’m usually taller than this.”</p><p class="double">“We all are,” Smart Cookie added. “We were full grown mares, but some fearful curse has reduced us to filly-hood.”</p><p class="double">She examined the alicorn’s face for signs of recognition or understanding, and saw none. “We recently forged an alliance between our three races but there are members of all three who fear change and the loss of their existing power, and would return our peoples to three mutually suspicious, feuding tribes. They would consider you an abomination. So we may have common cause. May we know your name?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;May we know your name?” said the precocious little earth filly, Smart Cookie. The inner girl within Lauren almost squealed at the cuteness exuded by the three little ponies in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure. My name is Lauren Faust. It&#039;s great to meet you three. This is turning out to be the best dream I&#039;ve had in a long time. Although when I&#039;m not dreaming, I don&#039;t look like this.&quot; she gestured to her new body, &quot;I&#039;m human.&quot;</p><p class="double">Private Pansy and Smart Cookie looked confused, but Clever Clover spoke up. &quot;A Human? Strange hairless minotaur-apes from another dimension? Those are a myth.&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony and pegasus looked at their friend. &quot;You&#039;re an absolute mine of of useless information, aren&#039;t you Clover?&quot; Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I enjoy the reading of fanciful tales and mythical beasts in my spare time,&quot; Clever Clover defended herself, then grinned. &quot;Besides, it&#039;s not always useless, case in point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One for her side,&quot; Pansy quipped, and Smart Cookie shrugged, rolling her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;It doesn&#039;t mean I seriously think they exist though,&quot; Clover added.</p><p class="double">Lauren snorted in amusement. &quot;The magical unicorn doesn&#039;t believe in humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh you should read some of the stories written about them,&quot; Clover said. &quot;Ponies have claimed to have dreams, visions of other worlds, other times where these humans exist. Others believe that there are places in the world where the local magical field is so strong, it creates a weak point between different dimensions – pools, fracture planes of crystal, surfaces that reflect the light of other worlds. However, no-pony has ever shown them to exist, though admittedly such things would be unstable.</p><p class="double">&quot;That doesn&#039;t stop the stories though. Humans rarely seem to have magic, but they use tools even more than earth ponies. Wooden ships that sail through the roughest seas, armies in pegasus-like armour fighting ones in skins, or humans that wear unicorn-like plate, and ride horses who don&#039;t seem to object to the practice. Villages of mud brick or cities of stone. I&#039;ve even seen the writings of this one mad stallion who claimed there was a world where every pony had a human counterpart.&quot;</p><p class="double">She shook her head. &quot;I studied the stories when I got a scholarship to the Academy, before Starswirl took me as his apprentice...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can see where this is going,&quot; the alicorn said, &quot;but I can&#039;t write another high school drama, even one about a magic school. It&#039;s cliché, and after battling the kind of horrors they did in generation one, trying to master gym class seems like a vast demotion. Oh, you wouldn&#039;t know any horrible monstrosities for ponies to fight? Good villains make for good stories.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So you are a playwright,&quot; Smart Cookie said. &quot;If you are in need of monstrous villains, I can tell you about the windigos. The evil spirits of cold and hatred that brought about Fumblewinter. Only by standing united, did the three pony tribes manage to drive them off.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren thought for a moment. &quot;So, unkillable spirits of cold that could only be driven away? Nah, that&#039;s definitely too much like the dementors from Harry Potter. I guess I&#039;ll stick with using that silly bad dream pony.&quot; </p><p class="double">Smart Cookie looked ready to explode, but Pansy put a hoof on her shoulder, forestalling a tirade. &quot;Calm yourself. You heard her, she thinks this whole world is a dream she&#039;s having, she doesn&#039;t understand what we went through, you more than many.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie growled. &quot;Having the monsters that caused all that suffering , who almost killed us, dismissed so lightly...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;C&#039;mon, we have a mission to accomplish. She&#039;s clearly not interested in aiding us, and probably has no useful intelligence on the situation down there, so we had best leave her to her day dreams, and get on with finding some actual help.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover the Clever had put a hoof of her own on Smart Cookie&#039;s shoulder, but had turned back to the alicorn with a thoughtful expression on her face. &quot;Before we go, could I do a magical scan of you? It is just that I have never seen a pony like yourself, with both wings and a horn. I assure you, it is harmless.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Magical scan?&quot; That piqued Lauren&#039;s interest, &quot;Sure, go ahead!&quot;</p><p class="double">A faint glow formed around Lauren, causing her to twitch. &quot;Hey, that tickles!&quot;</p><p class="double">The faint glow swiftly cut off.</p><p class="double">&quot;I do apologize, ma&#039;am. It seems I was less than careful with my tests as I could not believe the result of the first one.&quot; Clover said in her most respectful tone of voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she a threat?&quot; the pegasus spoke for the first time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pansy, this alicorn; Lauren Faust, is several orders of magnitude more powerful than my mentor, Starswirl. If she wanted to, she could rotate the planet just by herself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie spoke up, astounded, &quot;But that takes hundreds of unicorns working together.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. And actually if what my scans tell me is correct; she has unicorn, pegasus, and earth pony magic all in harmonious resonance. If she so desired, I think she could rearrange the solar system.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies slowly looked over at the smiling, happy alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, this world is my dream. It makes sense that I could control the sun and the moon and the planets.&quot; Lauren swished her tail around in a complex circular pattern, and then stared at it, &quot;Oh my gosh! Did you know my tail is fully prehensile. Check this out!&quot;</p><p class="double">The smiling alicorn bent over to her side and promptly stuck the end of her straight brownish tail right into her left ear.</p><p class="double">Private Pansy gave a sigh, &quot;And to top it off, it appears that she is completely insane.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s why we can&#039;t leave her behind. You heard her, we&#039;re a dream, a fantasy, with no consequences for whatever she does. She could pull the moon out of the sky, or fling the sun away beyond recovery playing with her powers, or just by accident. She has has to come with us, so I can teach her at least the basics of controlling her power,&quot; Cover said quietly to the other two.</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie gritted her teeth, then schooled her expression into pleasantness.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ma&#039;am, or do you prefer to be called Lauren? Clover has offered to show you how to use that horn on your noggin. She&#039;s an amazing mage. and a capable teacher. All we ask is that you come with us, let me and Lieutenant Pansy deal with anything threatening, and not use your magic unless Clover approves it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can do magic?&quot; Lauren grinned. &quot;This keeps getting better and better!&quot;</p><p class="double">The group started down into town, with Clover going through a very brief explanation of how to focus energy in a horn, and shape it</p><p class="double">&quot;Every unicorn can do telekinesis, it&#039;s practically instinctive, and light spells are almost as simple. For more complex normally use spells, a matrix or pattern that embodies the most efficient way to shape the magical energies. However, if you have enough power, you can brute-force it just by willing the effect to happen. Though don&#039;t you try it yet, with your power you could hurt some-pony by accident. Now, watch me.&quot;</p><p class="double">She slowly built up energy in her short horn, and lifted a pebble from the side of the track, carrying it with her. &quot;You see what I did? Now you try it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren remembered the tingling sensation, and tried to build it up in her horn, as instructed. She picked out a pebble and willed it to rise. There was a whip crack and a vertical shooting star as the pebble shot up; a sheath of superheated plasma forming around it and reached escape velocity within a few hundred feet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops!&quot; Lauren blushed.</p><p class="double">Clover face-hooved. &quot;We&#039;ve gotta long way to go...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Curse our sister for robbing us of our magic!&quot; Fighting her sputtering magic, and still nursing a terrible headache, Nightmare Moon reached the town – well, more like a hamlet – and after checking her bearings, made her way toward the town centre. &quot;Oh well, we are sure it will suffice for these peasants.&quot;</p><p class="double">Just as she was going to approach for landing, her eyes fell upon her sister. &quot;’Tis thou!&quot; she cried. &quot;Tia, thou shalt PAY FOR THIS!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon swooped down from the sky like a bird of prey. Celestia’s ears drooped and her expression turned to horror. &quot;L-lulu!?&quot; Backing away, she was transfixed by the dark alicorn before her. &quot;B-bu-but I banished you away!&quot;</p><p class="double">The elder Celestia – as well as Luna, who had been talking to the Sun Princess’ smaller version when the alicorn of the night arrived – looked on, utterly perplexed by the scene unfolding before them. Because, however you looked at it, this impromptu piece was truly strange.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah!&quot; The Mare of the Moon stamped her hoof. &quot;Didst thou think it could hold us forever!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna leaned over to her sister and whispered: &quot;Did we- I! Did <i>I</i> really sound like this?&quot;</p><p class="double">‘Tia’ - the elder Celestia - nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;NO!!&quot; The smaller Celestia burst out, then caught herself. &quot;No! I was <i>hoping</i> for you to return some day, but...&quot; She trailed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;But what, <i>dearest</i> sister?&quot; Nightmare scoffed. &quot;Thou didst even lock away our magical abilities! We demand that thou dost return them!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Abilities?&quot; The other mare’s ears pricked up. &quot;I did not do a thing to them!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lie not, foul trickster!&quot; The midnight blue alicorn reared up on her hind legs and stomped back onto the ground. Then she lit her horn, which flickered briefly and then sputtered out. &quot;Does our magic look functional to thee!?&quot;</p><p class="double">‘Tia’ stepped in. &quot;Now, girls. Wh--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Interrupt not, fo-!&quot; Nightmare Moon’s pupils became as small as pinpricks. &quot;Tia!!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Luna face-hooved.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&#039;Celly&#039; tensed, and frowned at what her senses were telling her. Nightmare Moon was a pegasus, despite having a horn. The overlay spell that &#039;Tia&#039; had shown her – rather, reminded her of – showed an aetheric echo of a pegasus with some sort of odd charm under a false horn.</p><p class="double">It was a little fascinating how the charm interacted with pegasus magic to produce – she shook her head. Things were far too confusing to let herself go off on a tangent like that. She grit her teeth. &quot;Sister, please, more has gone wrong than you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;SILENCE!&quot; Nightmare Moon bellowed in the Royal Canterlot Voice, and Celly felt herself beginning to shrink under the intensity of her fallen sister&#039;s gaze.</p><p class="double">And that was when, deep down in the unconscious reaches of her being, she realized who her opponent was! Steeling herself, the diarch of the sun took a deep, calming breath... and stared right back. Her gaze was enough to force an entire griffon army into submission – yet it simply washed over Nightmare Moon as if it was nothing.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s quite enough, Nimmy,&quot; Luna said, and suddenly a wing came down over the Mare of Darkness.</p><p class="double">The false Nightmare Moon stiffened under the embrace. &quot;Nimmy?!&quot; she spluttered. Half-turning around, she glared at her alter ego. &quot;How darest thou call us pet names?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Simple.&quot; Giving a smirk, Luna pulled her closer and waved a hoof at her sister. &quot;While Tia and I have our suspicions, we&#039;re not quite sure who you are underneath this spell, but I am at least extending you the same courtesy we are extending to Twilight Sparkle while she thinks she is Celestia. Now, please, calm yourself and look around. What do you see?&quot;</p><p class="double">Calmly, Luna pointed out the decorations and that Nightmare Night was as much a celebration of the night as it was of fear.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon felt unsure. &quot;I just wanted them to love me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna gave a motherly smile as she said: &quot;They do, and I am pretty sure that they love who you are underneath as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Mare of the Moon blinked...</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess Celestia?&quot; Fluttershy turned her head. &quot;Princess Luna?&quot; She then examined her costume. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">‘Celly’ gawped. Then she started to smile. &quot;Huh. So there is a way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes hardened. &quot;<i>We</i> happened. And we do not intend to leave, yet!&quot;</p><p class="double">The smaller sun goddess&#039;s ears drooped. &quot;Or not.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cadance set back on her haunches in shock. She&#039;d been intending to visit Ponyville on Nightmare Night anyway this loop, just to see what it was like, but Twilight thinking she <i>was</i> Aunt Celestia was a bit much. As she numbly watched the attempted battle between &#039;Celly&#039; and &#039;Nimmy,&#039; she was interrupted by a gentle nudge at her fetlocks.</p><p class="double">She turned her head and found herself looking into a filly alicorn&#039;s bright eyes. &quot;Your Imperial Highness? Would you care for some tea?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance smiled. The Best Babysitter Ever™ was on the case.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrksxcin glided through the darkness, its wings humming quietly with aetheric energy as it observed the world below. There was a surprisingly large number of other flying creatures, but so far it had avoided being seen. Or the other flyers didn&#039;t care. Either way was acceptable--</p><p class="double">Suddenly its antennae burned, and it landed on a roof near a massive tree. With a quiet chitter, Chrksxcin peered over the edge of the roof.</p><p class="double">A collection of the odd flinchers were standing and conversing. Each one had a pair of wings and a stiff extension extending from the middle of their scanprods. More importantly, though, the sheer amount of aetheric power flowing through their bodies – except, oddly, the black one – was enough to level a planet. Had Chriksxcin had a concept of actual fear, it would have been utterly terrified. As it was, it was merely... cautious. Clearly one of them had to be responsible for transferring the Mi-Go to this world... or perhaps it was that <i>other</i> major aetheric power source Chrksxcin could feel coming up behind it.</p><p class="double">The fungus turned, observing the massive, manacled monster rising on a column of pure aether. That. That it did not wish to anger.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where is my Mistress?&quot; the creature thundered. &quot;Where is Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">Realizing that a confrontation between two massive sources of power was not something it wanted to get involved in, Chrksxcin scuttled to the other edge of the roof and glided away.</p><p class="double">[<hr>]</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, I was expecting a song cue back there...&quot; Lauren said, disappointed, as she held a boulder twice her size, and a ball of water from a convenient well in the air to either side of her. After several smaller rocks had achieved orbit, Clover had finally gotten her to tone her telekinesis down, by giving her something heavy so she needed less fine control.</p><p class="double">All three ponies looked at her oddly, but Clover was the one who asked, &quot;A song... queue? Only a few unicorns have the ability to focus their magic through music. It&#039;s a rare and powerful gift, and your emblem would surely show an affinity for it if you could.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren looked puzzled, &quot;Okay, what&#039;s an Emblem? I heard you talking about it earlier... oh, you mean my cutie-mark?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what some of the younger ponies are calling it nowadays.&quot; Smart Cookie said, &quot;Spear Shaker and his crowd, the same bunch that are coming up with that slang that idiot from earlier was spouting.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now that&#039;s a fun idea, Shakespeare as a teenage rebel...&quot; Lauren mused.</p><p class="double">&quot;How do you know of Emblems if you don&#039;t know of this world?&quot; Pansy asked, slightly suspicious.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve got stories about something similar at home. Cutie-marks show a pony&#039;s special talent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Partly right. Emb... cutie-marks show how a pony has decided to express their special talent. For example, my talent is learning and studying magic, and my cutie-mark is a four leafed clover with a book resting on it. Clovers, especially the four leafed kind, are magically powerful reagents and can enhance pretty much any spell or potion. I received it when I became Starswirl&#039;s apprentice. It represents how I can help enhance magic through study and research. If I&#039;d taken the instructor position at the Academy, as I loved teaching almost as much, my mark might have been different.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Can I see it?&quot; Lauren exclaimed.</p><p class="double">Clover sagged slightly. &quot;Unfortunately, these de-aged bodies have no cutie-marks. I still don&#039;t understand it, our memories and experiences are intact, so that decision, that expression of our souls should be too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Ware ahead!&quot; Pansy pointed up ahead where they could see a scene of chaos across the bridge that lead into the town square. Several ponies in outlandish clothing were running around, both adults and foals, and there was a lot of yelling and screaming.</p><p class="double">&quot;The hay!&quot; Smart Cookie frowned. &quot;What are those things!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Things out of old mare&#039;s tales!&quot; Clover replied analytically. &quot;A vampony, a wolf lycanthrope, and... I&#039;m not even sure what that thing in bandages is, but it looks like some old legend of undead creatures... and other ponies all mixed in! There&#039;s too much happening!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy was taking a more tactical approach. &quot;From the way they&#039;re placed, I think the vampony and the werewolf were fighting each other and the other undead is trying to keep them apart. I think the other ponies are just underhoof, too scared to get out of the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well some-pony&#039;s got to stop them before any-pony gets hurt!&quot; Smart Cookie exclaimed, and started forward.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait!&quot; Pansy&#039;s voice had a snap of command, and Smart Cookie froze. &quot;None of us are at our normal strength.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Pansy, we can&#039;t just do nothing!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus shook her head. &quot;No, but we need a plan. Clover, strengths and weaknesses?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If the old legends... vampony, can&#039;t cross running water, shies from magical light, killed by sunlight, staking or beheading. Lycanthropes, regenerate from anything except wolfsbane or silver, but there&#039;s a pony trapped inside, not in control of their actions, unlike the other two it&#039;s a living creature, could be knocked out. The other undead, magical light again. All three are tougher and faster than any regular pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm... Clover, you stay back, support us with cantrips to keep the other two from attacking us while we pony-pile them one at a time. Smarty, I need you to hit them low, buck things at them, while I drop in from above. Lauren, stay back here with Clover, your magic is too unreliable for a fight. If only we had some of those things you said...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Normally I could summon them without too much trouble,&quot; apologised Clover, &quot;or transmute your horse-shoes to silver temporarily.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you can&#039;t,&quot; Lauren stated as she gently set down her boulder. However, her massive orb of water was still in the air, &quot;You may have been mighty warriors in the past, but right now you are just three little fillies. That means you are not going out there to fight monsters that were made to scare adults. Besides, it seems to be a stalemate from what I can see. The mummy pony is keeping the vampir.. er.. vampony and werewolf pony from attacking each other. It&#039;s like better version of that Twilight series. It would have been at least kind of entertaining if Bella was secretly a mummy...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That what do you suggest for our course of action, Ma&#039;am?&quot; Clover asked, having gotten somewhat used to the alicorn&#039;s unidentifiable references.</p><p class="double">&quot;We wait. We watch. If anything tries to attack us, I&#039;ll gently throw my water ball at them. How&#039;s that for running water, hah!&quot; Lauren said to the three little de-aged ponies, before sitting down on the grass, &quot;Look, I just wanted to say I&#039;m sorry. Even if this is my dream, I should have been a bit more respectful of you three. I used to play with my little pony dolls as a child; I&#039;d stage elaborate adventures, and now I&#039;m in one. Who&#039;s to say that dream worlds are any less real than the one we live in. It could be just like in the Sandman books. In any case, I apologize.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clever Clover, Smart Cookie, and Private Pansy looked at each other. Cookie still seemed angry at her tribe&#039;s near extinction being dismissed so casually. Pansy was never a pony of many words, and that trait didn&#039;t seem to changing soon. Clover spoke up, &quot;I accept your apology, Ma&#039;am. Just do try to be more careful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll try, but it&#039;s not that easy.&quot; Lauren sighed. &quot;It&#039;s like someone telling you to take the smallest step you can, but when you try it&#039;s never small enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">No one really had anything to say to that. Instead, the three fillies crouched down next to the alicorn while watching all angles for possible attack. It was quiet for several minutes before Lauren spoke up quietly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m glad you girls don&#039;t look like my old dolls, though. Instead of being all chubby looking with long muzzles, you&#039;re more like sleek pony-cat hybrids.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... thank you?&quot; Clever Clover replied, &quot;There is actually a great deal of research and controversy on how we evolved traits more in common with predatory animals like forward facing eyes and...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not the time for this,&quot; Pansy interrupted.</p><p class="double">There was silence as the four ponies watched the stalemate. The mummy pony was still keeping the other two from fighting while constantly chattering in her strange language, but was getting more exasperated. Other ponies, dressed up in various outfits, gave them a wide berth as they ran around in the pandemonium.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still think this is my dream,&quot; Lauren pointed with her hoof to a pony dressed as a dentist who was threatening any other pony she saw with a giant levitating toothbrush. Also, her mane was made of toothpaste. &quot;How else can you explain that other than my subconscious telling me I should brush more often.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is an exceptionally odd sight,&quot; Smart Cookie admitted, &quot;as is that.&quot; She pointed to where two viking pegasus ponies were trading sword strokes with several pirate ponies who were led by a small colt.</p><p class="double">&quot;No band of undisciplined viking raiders can match up to the dread pirate Pipsqueak and his crew!&quot; cried out the high pitched voice of the pirate captain.</p><p class="double">The lead viking mare spoke up, &quot;But what if the viking raiders hired a ninja mercenary?&quot;</p><p class="double">And out of nowhere, a ninja stallion entered the fray.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot; Lauren stared at this. &quot;I got nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">That was when every pony&#039;s attention was drawn to an immense dragon-genie which rose up out of the centre of town with a mighty roar.</p><p class="double">The three fillies turned towards the alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t use that,&quot; Lauren said calmly as she stared ahead, &quot;Dragonball did it first.&quot;</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>Clever Clover just gave a long sigh. “You do realise we have no idea what you&#039;re talking about?”</p><p class="double">“I just wish I could power a translation spell. I want to know what that... mummy, you called it... is saying. For that matter, the town itself doesn&#039;t make sense!”</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie nodded. “I noticed that too, it looks like an earth-pony settlement, but fancied up by unicorns! All the windows are glazed rather than shuttered, the houses have multiple stories and they even have fountains! It looks long established, but... nothing in Equestria is yet. We&#039;ve been here less than a dozen years, but the roads here are all paved, the bridge is well crafted stone and there are all kinds of fancy decoration, even without those things for whatever festival they were having.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m more interested in the ponies,” Pansy said.</p><p class="double">“The fact that even I don&#039;t know what half of the costumes are supposed to be, or the fact that there&#039;s unicorns, earth ponies and pegasi all mixed in?” Clover asked.</p><p class="double">“Both, Pansy replied.</p><p class="double">“Arrgh! I hate just sitting here and not being able to find out what&#039;s going on!” Clover fumed. “If only I had more power... Wait!”</p><p class="double">She turned back to Lauren, a dawning realisation in her eyes. “If we could find a safe way to regulate the power flow, you could lend us some of your power. You have the powers of all three races in you, and in such quantity that you could empower us and never miss the difference.”</p><p class="double">She started pacing again. “The problem is your control. It&#039;s getting better, but it wouldn&#039;t take much excess to burn us out. Of course, you&#039;d have to agree in the first place. Let me see... applying Gutterhoof&#039;s fourth nume the parametric phase variance would modulate the power flow in phase... we&#039;d need some yellow chalk... reversing the polarity of the thaumic flow... would that make it a Singlestone trapdoor function? T equals H F squared where H is the harmonic factor and friendship... Adjusting for the incident light level... we could omit the dribbly candles.”</p><p class="double">“What on earth is she going about?” Lauren asked.</p><p class="double">Pansy shook her head. “She gets like this when she&#039;s doing her magic stuff. Just let her be, she&#039;ll come up for air soon enough. But if you really can lend us your power, please do so! I don&#039;t know how much you&#039;ve used those wings, but if you have, you must know what it&#039;s like for a pegasus to be grounded! I feel so... limited, unable to protect my friends!”</p><p class="double">“Likewise!” Smart Cookie added. “That giant creature seems to be coming closer, and it doesn&#039;t look friendly.”</p><p class="double">“... and a three eights Gripley!” Clover finished. “I&#039;ve got it! We use a triune ritual diagram, but we reverse it! We create a set of linked stones at the nodes for Pansy and Smart Cookie and I stay at the third node to act as the control element. Since I won&#039;t be channelling the power directly, I can avoid being overloaded. I can even help you control your power.”</p><p class="double">She noticed the approaching genie. “Uh oh... No time for more lessons, I&#039;ll need help setting it up, and you need some spells of your own. I can copy some of my own knowledge into your mind, it&#039;ll only work for a half hour before they fade, but at least you&#039;ll be able to defend yourself. Drop the water in the river...”</p><p class="double">Lauren still wasn&#039;t sure about acting as a magical battery for these three, but learning spells was something she was right behind. She dropped the water. “Okay! What do I do?”</p><p class="double">“Just touch your horn to mine.” Clover stepped in front of her, and lowered her head slightly to point her horn directly at the alicorn. Lauren lowered her own head to touch horns, and Clover&#039;s horn glowed slightly. “Darn! I don&#039;t have enough power even for this... will the knowledge to come to you, apply your power, but gently, gently.”</p><p class="double">Lauren took a deep breath, and tried gently – ever so gently, to will a copy of Clover&#039;s knowledge of spells into her mind. </p><p class="double">There was a <b>flash</b> of light. </p><p class="double"><i>She was nervous and it felt like there were butterflies in her tummy, all trying to escape. She had just been chosen by the great unicorn mage, Starswirl, to be his student after pleading to learn magic. She was determined, but still there was fear that she wouldn&#039;t be up to the task. She resolved to master as many aspects of magic as she could.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Tomes, books, and figures all spread out on an old oaken desk. A single candle burning away as she took a deep breath and cast the first spell she had created all on her lonesome. Waking up bleary eyed from the resultant explosion and crawling over to a scorched scroll to mark down not only another failure, but another step closer to success. Spell formulas and magical diagrams raced through her mind.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Making light of her teacher&#039;s new beard, calling it ridiculous. His reply was to laugh and something even more ridiculous to draw attention away from his facial hair, like putting silly bells in his hat.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Standing at her teacher&#039;s side as he tended to King Platinum&#039;s growing illness. Overhearing the whispers of the unicorn nobles as they planned their power plays and schemes. She didn&#039;t really think any pony would really start blaming the pegasi for the growing number of gryphon incursions or the earth ponies for the rising cost of food. It was only logical that the blame should fall on the gryphon marauder raids which the pegasi were fighting off. Therefore they could not manage the weather as efficiently, and thus the harvest wasn&#039;t as great.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Why weren&#039;t more ponies logical? At the gathering of the three tribes, she had met only two others who could see the truth – an earth pony and a pegasus. With a heavy heart, she watched her princess fall sway to the whispers of her noble advisers. The argument between her and the leaders of the other two tribes only got louder.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>They came in from the icy north. The gryphons united in their desire to flee. The ponies planned to stay through the winter.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>The winter should have ended months ago, but was only growing colder. She and her teacher spent every waking moment looking for an answer.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>The chill pierced her skin and seemed to permeate right down to her bones. She added another layer of enchantment on her cloak. They had a name now. Windigos. The current theory was that whatever spawned the horrid changelings, made their inverse. Beings who feed on hate and anger, rather than love and friendship. So far, there were no solid theories on how to defeat them. All spells and enchantments had failed, as had the strength of the earth ponies and the speed and agility of the pegasi.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>When the going gets tough, the ponies leave. The paradise state was no longer. The survivors made their decision. Taking only what could be carried or hauled in wagons, the ragged freezing members of each pony tribe started off in their own direction. The long exodus had begun.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Cold. So many lost to the cold. And the windigoes seemed to be following them, gaining on the caravan. This meant the volunteers who stayed behind to distract them were no more. Her tears froze before they hit the ground.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>The leaders should protect their people. Starswirl stayed behind to research and coordinate the last effort – a mass teleportation spell that would require every remaining capable unicorn to cast. It would have the power to send only the foals and the surviving elderly to someplace safe. Someplace far away. Clover volunteered to go with her princess to draw off the windigos. She did not expect to see her two friends and their respective leaders attempting the same thing.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>A touch of harmony. That is what Starswirl called the harmonic resonance created by the three pony tribes. The earth ponies channelled their stamina, the pegasus ponies channelled their atmospheric control, and the unicorn spell tied them all together as each wished for the same thing with all their might. With all their hearts and with all their souls. And the windigoes were no more.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double">Lauren&#039;s horn slowly pulled away from Clover, who was staring at her in wide-eyed horror. What she had done was a crime of the gravest nature. A pony&#039;s mind was their own, a sacred refuge that should never be invaded; and that alicorn... she... she... she was hugging her.</p><p class="double">The alicorn cried as she tightly hugged the smaller filly. A barely audible whisper sounded in Clover&#039;s ear, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;m so, so sorry.&quot; </p><p class="double">Clover&#039;s shock melted away like snow under dragonflame, replaced by pity as she realised just what the other pony had experienced. She raised her fore-hoof and hugged back. &quot;No, I&#039;m sorry. I didn&#039;t think, if my own magic wasn&#039;t powerful enough to push the memories I wanted to give you, it wouldn&#039;t be powerful enough to limit what you&#039;d receive when you drew on them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe I wanted you to understand, and that makes it even worse. I wouldn&#039;t consciously forced any-pony to endure the memories of the hardships we went through, especially some-pony who clearly comes from a gentler place. But we must go ahead from what is, can you forgive me for any hurt I caused you? At least you should now have my spells, and the memories of my own training, which should make your control better.&quot;</p><p class="double">Genie Spike now towered over the square, his eyes lighting on the vampony who was still duking it out with the werewolf (a were-pony would imply that someone turned into a pony under the full moon... actually, sign me up!). He bowed his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;My Mistress Rarity, I am here to serve you. What is your command?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy winced. &quot;Oh frozen waste! This can&#039;t be good! I think the stalemate just turned into a checkmate!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash didn&#039;t know exactly how long she&#039;d kept Rarity and AJ from tearing each other apart, but she figured it was more then long enough for an amnesiac alicorn to fly to Sweet Apple Acres, learn magic, and return with the Cutie Mark Crusaders in tow. This was primarily based on her observation of a Fausticorn having a conversation with three foals while levitating a sphere of water; admittedly that wasn&#039;t a very accurate measurement of time, but the fact remained that whoever the Fausticorn actually was – definitely a looper, anyway – she wasn&#039;t acting as a creator of worlds but more like a very confused fangirl. Which kind of made sense in a way.</p><p class="double">&quot;هيا لكم اثنين، مجرد التوقف عن هذا. نحن جميعا أصدقاء هنا. كنت ما زلت لا أفهم كلمة وأنا أقول هل.&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Come on you two, just stop this. We&#039;re all friends here. You still don&#039;t understand a word I&#039;m saying do you.</span></p><p class="double">&quot;Wretched cur! Kneel before my glory!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AWOOOOOOO!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;هذه هي سابع معظم قصة رعب مبتذلة لقد سبق إختطف في,&quot; Rainbow muttered to herself. &quot;الفروع، واسمحوا يكون هناك نوعا من تطور مؤامرة ...&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This is the seventh most cliche horror story I&#039;ve ever been shanghaied into. Branches, PLEASE let there be some sort of plot twist...</span></p><p class="double">&quot;My Mistress Rarity,&quot; boomed a voice, &quot;I am here to serve you. What is your command?&quot;</p><p class="double">Oh. Well that was probably bad.</p><p class="double">Mummy Dash, lady Belle, and Applewolf, all turned to see the dragon genie towering over the small town of Ponyville. Rarity and Applejack were slightly stunned, having apparently not remembered this among all the other things that their costumes had made them forget. Rainbow Dash, however, was working her mind furiously. What did she know about genies? Wishes, untold power, Twilight said they were Saddle-Arabian in origin--</p><p class="double">Wait. Wasn&#039;t Saddle Arabia near the old Sphinx Empire? Well, at least she remembered it being there in the loops where she raced around the world... And mummies were a Sphinx Empire thing. So maybe, just maybe--</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, I...&quot; Rarity composed herself. &quot;...am most happy to see you--&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash suddenly shouted, her strange words flying through the air.</p><p class="double">The dragon genie blinked. &quot;She wants to... truly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;نعم!&quot; Rainbow nodded quickly, emphasizing her words with a strange gesture.</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Yes!</span></p><p class="double">&quot;You can understand this mare?&quot; Rarity looked from the mummy to the genie. &quot;What is she saying?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She... claims you wish to...&quot; Spike blushed a bit, trailing off.</p><p class="double">The vampire blinked.</p><p class="double">She looked at the genie.</p><p class="double">There was a quiet moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... you do seem to have some talent in the arts of shapeshifting...&quot; she mused. &quot;And I do rather need some relaxation after dealing with this disgusting beast. Come then! We shall away to my castle!&quot;</p><p class="double">With a flash, genie and vampire disappeared. Rainbow Dash gave a musty breath of relief.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Apple Bloom or whoever she thought she was coughed. &quot;Well... that was... disturbing.&quot; She gave the mummy a look. &quot;Did you really...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged, shuffling a hoof and glancing away. &quot;مهلا، ما اذا كان يعمل يعمل.&quot; She hadn&#039;t been sure that the genie would even understand her; it was really a massive stroke of luck.</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hey, if it works it works.</span></p><p class="double">After a moment, Applejack started rolling on the ground with a whuffling laugh.</p><p class="double">Ignoring the happy wolf-pony for a moment, Lauren turned towards Smart Cookie, &quot;Wait, you could understand that mummy pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cookie notched her head to one side, &quot;Not exactly. From the way they reacted I could get the general gist. Figuring out what the other pony&#039;s not saying is pretty much a key skill in my job. And at least one word sounded similar to something I heard from a camel trader who came up past the Southern mountains. He wasn&#039;t my type though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s just... Clover seemed so knowledgeable,&quot; the alicorn said.</p><p class="double">Clover sighed and rolled her eyes, &quot;Because you were talking about magical spells. You have my memories, you should know while I&#039;ve studied many things, languages aren&#039;t one of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Speaking of which, Lauren, do you think you can manage a translation spell?&quot; Pansy asked. &quot;It should prevent any other confusion.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren thought through her new memories for a moment before recalling Clover learning, practising, and managing one such spell, &quot;I think so. Hold on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gathering in her horn what to her felt like a tiny iota of her power, the alicorn imprinted the spell matrix of what she wanted the magic to do; linking concepts with spoken and written words. And in one pulse, she let the magic out. A wave of pale blue engulfed the nearby ponies, then the nearby buildings, then the nearby country side; then everything was pale blue for a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;That, may have been a little too much power,&quot; Lauren stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t say, you strange pony-bird,&quot; said the small blue jay that was sitting on a nearby tree, &quot;Oh, I smell food over that way. Maybe the nice yellow pony-bird left some out again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nuts, nuts, nuts. I got to find the tasty nuts and hide them before the cold comes,&quot; sang a nearby squirrel as it raced along the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot; happily greeted Winona the dog as she raced along. She spotted the wolf pony whose scent was almost the same as her old friend/master/alpha female, except she was a wolf pony now – which made her even better! &quot;Hey! Hey!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot; yipped Applejack, &quot;Play?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay!&quot; barked Winona as the two raced off together.</p><p class="double">Somewhere, a strange winged wasp/crab/mushroom creature suddenly understood the odd beings around it. It also seemed to possess a strange desire to compile all the recipes and desserts from its culture, for some reason. &#039;<i>To serve Mi-go&#039;, that it was a cookbook should be inherently understandable, right?</i> it thought.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can you understand me now?&quot; Mummy Dash asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;We can.&quot; came from Lauren and the three former cutie mark crusaders.</p><p class="double">&quot;Great! Finally!&quot; exclaimed the mummy, &quot;So... er... any ideas what&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We were hoping you could tell us,&quot; Smart Cookie asked. &quot;This entire town seems to have gone insane! As witness I&#039;m talking to a dead person wrapped in bandages.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, this is just a costume, remember?&quot; Dash looked quizzically at them.</p><p class="double">Pansy shook her head. &quot;Uh huh, I&#039;ve seen too many dead pegasi not to know one when I see one. Look at your wings, you can see the bones through the feathers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash grimaced, not bothering to look at her wing. &quot;I suppose Private Pansy would be an expert?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The name is Lieutenant Pansy.&quot; The younger pegasus looked up at the older one, surprised by the lack of recognition. &quot;You know, second in command to Commander Hurricane? For that matter, who and what are you, and why are you still moving around? Some weird magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw great! The same thing&#039;s happened to you three hasn&#039;t it?&quot; Rainbow Dash facehooved. &quot;You guys think you&#039;re really the three founders!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And who do you think we are? For that matter, who do you think you are?&quot; Clover asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well I&#039;m Rainbow Dash, most awesome flyer in Equestria, and I dressed up as a mummy for Nightmare Night, from &#039;Daring Do and the Pyramid of the Ancients&#039;. I was going to do Daring Do but the pith helmet I ordered didn&#039;t come in time. So I did the mummy instead. Pretty quick fix, just wrapped some layers of TP around myself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity and Applejack had just gotten into their costumes when the world went wobbly for a second, and then they <i>really</i> got into their costumes. Rarity was doing the whole &#039;Queen of the Night&#039; thing, and Applejack went to the dogs. I haven&#039;t seen them fight like that since... well, I wasn&#039;t actually around for Twilight&#039;s sleepover, but I heard the screams.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I ended up like this...&quot; She finally did examine her wing, and looked ill at the moth-eaten condition. &quot;It&#039;s like we&#039;ve all been changed into our costumes, only they changed inside as well as out, though maybe not completely if Spike and Rarity are still into each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re making no sense!&quot; Clover said in an exasperated voice. &quot;For that matter neither does this town, or this festival, &#039;Nightmare Night&#039; as you call it. It has been a scant dozen years since the Exodus, how could this town be so well developed? And you speak as if we should know those ponies. We woke up here only hours ago, having been snatched away and somehow de-aged and stripped of our emblems – our cutie marks. </p><p class="double">&quot;We must contact Chancellor Puddinghead, or my mentor Starswirl, as this must be some ploy by the old guard to try and split the three tribes by depriving them of the focus around which the Alliance is built. They tried to take our memories too, but our friendship must have protected them. They must have believed that bringing us up as unaware friends would maintain the Fire of Friendship while removing us as political figures.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash shook her head, dislodging some dust which made her sneeze. &quot;Celestia, you three have it bad. Still, you three spent enough time studying at Twilight&#039;s to get your costumes just right. I guess some of it rubbed off.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What in the frozen wastes do you mean?&quot; Pansy exclaimed, &quot;Are you claiming we are some sort of magical copies, created by some spell?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All I know is that the three of you still look like Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo under those costumes, and that the three of you were going to dress as Smart Cookie, Clover the Clever and Private Pansy for Nightmare Night. You do the maths.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celly pondered what she&#039;d been told, and the disturbing shift in Nightmare Moon&#039;s... <i>Nimmy&#039;s</i> personality.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t that the other personality was abhorrent. <i>By Ash and Elder, the sweet thing is not abhorrent at all.</i> It was the moments of struggle and the changeover that disturbed her most. Her own spike of curiosity and dry cataloguing of the symptoms, and the fact that her tiara was gently pulsing magic, letting her see a trio of spectral butterflies flitting across Nimmy&#039;s cutie mark. Celly felt the ache in her heart of not only fighting to save the &quot;Lulu&quot; at the heart of &quot;Nimmy&quot; but trying to save the pegasus inside as well.</p><p class="double">She also worried about the fact she wasn&#039;t as worried about the lost soul potentially within herself. What she was really worried about was that sudden surge of alicorn magic across town. Oh, and the apparent dragon genie.</p><p class="double">&#039;Here we go again, Celestia,&#039; she thought as the elder diarchs swung their own heads to search for the source of the disturbance. Celly frowned at the sarcastic bent of the thought.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">&quot;So...&quot; Faust said slowly. &quot;One of my creations who I haven&#039;t created yet dressed up like, and became a copy of, myself. So, I&#039;m probably writing this right now and threw in a self-insert as an in-joke.&quot; She groaned. &quot;I hate me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash sighed. &quot;Actually... how do I put this. Let me think.... You&#039;re kind of a metajoke. See, Celestia and Luna&#039;s mother was named Faust, and there&#039;s this recent sort of comedy series where...&quot; The mummy waved a bandaged hoof vaguely at the alicorn, well aware that mentioning the loops and a hub universe would probably make her lose all credibility. &quot;So... yeah, heh. Twilight could tell you more, she&#039;s the egghead.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie looked back and forth between the alicorn and the mummy incredulously. &quot;You can&#039;t possibly believe this load of horseapples! I&#039;m myself, not some ghost or shadow puppet created by some-pony&#039;s imagination! Clover, tell her...&quot;</p><p class="double">But Clover was standing very still, mumbling to herself. &quot;Emblems... memory... illusion... but that would mean...&quot;</p><p class="double">Her eyes widened and she swayed on her hooves. Then she turned to the other two and they were shocked to see tears in her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, by the Source! It makes sense, it&#039;s the only thing that makes sense! Look around you, this isn&#039;t our Equestria! You know I wondered why our emblems didn&#039;t restore themselves with our memories. Our memories and souls are intact, and an Emblem is an expression of our souls, our destinies. Magic capable of affecting that is beyond any-pony I know, and if some-pony had that much power, they wouldn&#039;t need to trick us, they could just rewrite the world to order. But if these bodies aren&#039;t our own, our souls and destinies can&#039;t affect them. That would explain why our emblems didn&#039;t appear.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her gaze grew distant, then focussed on something far away. &quot;Oh no, there was that, the whole time! Pansy, look up in the mountains!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy and Smart Cookie followed her gaze, where Canterlot blazed on the mountain above in it&#039;s own festival colours.</p><p class="double">&quot;But, there&#039;s no city like that anywhere!&quot; Pansy gasped. &quot;It&#039;s huge!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You lead most of the surveys, do you recognise the distinctive shape of that peak?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No... yes, Mount Canter, where the unicorns have that new mining camp! But there was nothing like that there, I swear it! And that would mean this is somewhere on the Everfree plains.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover turned to Dash, eyes dark. &quot;Two more questions. What&#039;s the name of that city, and how long is it since the exodus, since... us?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash didn&#039;t look happy about the way her comments had been received, and hesitated, but Clover&#039;s gaze held on her until she gave a sigh. &quot;Canterlot, the capital of Equestria. As to how long, I don&#039;t know, egg-head stuff isn&#039;t my thing, but more than a thousand years, a lot more.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie shook her head violently. &quot;No, I&#039;m not buying it! This has to be a trick, some kind of illusion to make us lose hope, this can&#039;t be the truth!&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover shook her head. &quot;I thought of that first, but it won&#039;t wash. There are too many unfamiliar things, too much change. Did you recognise even a tithe of those costumes, the styles of the housing? An illusion works by drawing you in, making your own mind do the hard work. Adding that many new elements would make it crack like cheap wattle, no matter how much raw power you threw at it. No, only reality hurts this much.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what about her, why does she remember what happened?&quot; Smart Cookie pointed at Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;From what she said, that &#039;mummy&#039; costume was a last minute thing, whereas our costumes were a labour of love. Maybe the more effort some-pony put into the costume, the deeper the change goes.&quot; She sniffled back her tears and asked Dash. &quot;If they made costumes of us, ponies still remember us, even after all this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash was feeling as rotten as she looked for how she&#039;d hurt them, and saw a way to make up for it a bit. &quot;Are you kidding? You&#039;re the Founders, the ponies who started it all! You saved every-pony, founded Equestria, we even have a holiday just to celebrate it, Hearth&#039;s warming Eve! You&#039;re the most famous ponies in the history of... history!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then we succeeded?&quot; Clover asked hopefully. &quot;The three tribes learned to live together?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just look at the three of you.&quot; Dash pointed at them. &quot;Scoots, Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom are the best of friends. They may fight occasionally, but I&#039;ve never heard them fight because they&#039;re not the same race. Just the idea that ponies could do that freaks most ponies out, it&#039;d be like ponies fighting because they had different coat colours or mane styles. Doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t have some problems, but yeah, you guys did it, big time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s something, at least.&quot; Clover sighed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She tried to hold it in. She really did. But at the highly emotional moment when the three fillies-turned-historical-legends were wrapped up in the joy of knowing that their mission was a success, that the three pony tribes not only managed to live together in peace, but thrive; it just came out.</p><p class="double">Lauren spoke out, &quot;Buffy did it!&quot;</p><p class="double">All eyes turned towards the alicorn who now had her front hooves covering her mouth.</p><p class="double">She slowly lowered her hooves and took a deep breath, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. It just came to me. People turning into their costumes. I remembered something similar happening in a show I saw, but it was years ago.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What caused such an event?&quot; Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">Pansy chimed in, &quot;And how was it ended?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me think. There was a statue to a chaos god or something.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord,&quot; Rainbow Dash almost growled. It had been many, many relative years since before the loops started... but she still hadn&#039;t <i>completely</i> forgiven him for taking away her wings, &quot;He&#039;s the big-wig spirit of chaos around here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren nodded, &quot;Okay, and there was a chaos mage who kicked off the whole thing. Is there a pony around here that likes or worships chaos?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mummy Rainbow Dash gave off a long, dust-filled sigh, &quot;Pinkie Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a pause as the pegasus collected her thoughts. &quot;Imagine the living embodiment of a sugar high who likes to party, dance, sing, do completely impossible things, and then party even more and you&#039;ll pretty much know what she&#039;s like.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren smiled, fondly remembering one of her old pony dolls. &quot;Great. Now we just need to find where she has the statue and smash it. Then everyone will be back to normal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what happened to the assumed personas on this show?&quot; Clever Clover asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t really know,&quot; the alicorn said, &quot;The fillies you all are possessing may retain some of your memories and skills. The show I saw never showed what happened to the ones who possessed the costumed people.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover nodded in understanding, &quot;A pity our real selves will never know of this. It would be a comfort knowing we will succeed beyond our expectations. Still, we can help, agreed?&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked at the other two. Pansy just nodded, but Smart Cookie gave a deep sigh and said, &quot;It&#039;s not given to a pony how long they live, but we can control how we use that time, even if it&#039;s only a single night. Freeing this town would be a good use of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So where would this Pinkie Pie have the chaos statue?&quot; Pansy questioned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sugarcube Corner.&quot; Rainbow Dash motioned to the others to follow her, &quot;The bakery that looks like a giant gingerbread cookie house. It makes that unicorn who wants to be a dentist growl every time she has to walk past it. It&#039;s this-a-way.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the group turned a corner, they came upon the assorted Celestias, Lunas, and Nightmare Moons. They all turned towards the new alicorn, eyes widening in recognition.</p><p class="double">A chorus of voices called out in hopeful amazement, &quot;Mother?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mother, is that... is that truly you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, sister, it is not her,&quot; Nightmare Moon snapped. &quot;Lest ye forget, this is the night of costumes, of which We and thou art also.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her face softened considerably. &quot;There&#039;s no reason to be rude, Nightmare.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren took a breath. &quot;I... um... Listen, dear... I&#039;m not exactly your mother. I... don&#039;t even have memories of you...&quot;</p><p class="double">The younger Celestia wilted. &quot;...I see...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, um... hugs?&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Celly&#039; stepped forward, almost teary eyed, and took the proffered embrace.</p><p class="double">Nightmare moon scoffed, then slapped herself. &quot;Ow! That was not necessary! Yes it was and you know it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash gave Nightmare Moon an odd look. &quot;What&#039;s up with you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re not exactly sure how, but Fluttershy managed to somewhat break through the ensorcellment.&quot; Luna stepped forward and nodded to the founders. &quot;It is an honour to be in your presence once more, even if you are not truly... well. The fact remains, we do require some assistance in organizing a reaction to... are you aware of what is happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;According to the Metajoke Faust over there,&quot; Rainbow Dash pointed at the red maned alicorn giving &#039;Celly&#039; an awkward smile, &quot;some servant of chaos made a chaos statue and now everyone&#039;s become their costumes. Kind of. I&#039;m still Rainbow Dash, I&#039;m just a mummy now, but the crusaders have... they&#039;re the founders, mind and soul.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A statue?&quot; Luna tilted her head. &quot;That&#039;s an... interesting idea-&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow leaned in close and whispered quickly. Luna&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;Oh. Right. That makes sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Tia&#039; shook her head. &quot;So, from all that, I assume... Pinkie Pie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It would make sense,&quot; Rainbow replied. &quot;Let&#039;s just head over to Sugarcube Corner and...&quot;</p><p class="double">She blinked. &quot;Is... is that a fire over there?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;NO! You are not going in there, Dinky, and that&#039;s FINAL!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, miss, I have to make sure that nopony&#039;s trapped in there! It&#039;s my job!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOU ARE NOT A FIREPONY!&quot; Derpy yelled, tears streaming down her face. &quot;YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER! I&#039;M NOT GOING TO LOSE YOU!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe I am!&quot; the filly snapped. &quot;Maybe I&#039;m your daughter and I&#039;m transformed and I don&#039;t remember anything about it! That doesn&#039;t change the fact that there is a building on fire! Even if nopony is in there, I have to stop it! Who else can?! Who else here has the knowledge, ability, and let&#039;s face it <i>sanity</i> to handle this?!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus looked up at the blazing sugarcube corner. &quot;I... I...&quot; She sniffled. &quot;Just.... please. Try not to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I promise I&#039;ll come back.&quot; The firepony hugged her gently. &quot;Don&#039;t worry. I promise that I&#039;ll come back.&quot;</p><p class="double">And neither of them noticed the pink form flying away from the blaze, an odd little statue gripped in its claws as it glided toward the Everfree.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As soon as she started to get close to the burning building, Lieutenant Quick Deployment felt the heat of the burning blaze that was consuming the building and weakening its structural integrity. Her oxygen tank was almost empty and the backup from the station hadn&#039;t arrived yet, leaving her without much time to think. She needed to act fast and look for anyone still trapped in Sugarcube Corner. </p><p class="double">She touched the front door handle with her hoof and found it burning hot. Her fire axe swung telekinetically through the air, making some holes for the flames start to burst through and equalizing the oxygen inside. Quick Deployment steadied herself, taking a few steps back.</p><p class="double">Then she charged the door, bursting through with a single swing of her axe.</p><p class="double">&quot;PONYVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT!&quot; she shouted through her oxygen mask. &quot;IS ANYONE HERE? PLEASE ANSWER OR MAKE SOME NOISE SO I CAN GET TO WHERE YOU ARE!&quot; Her experienced eyes scanned the front of the business, quickly determining that the fire had started in the kitchens. The flames and her small body made said room inaccessible, but the stairs seemed to be safe. She rushed up, pressing her hoof against the first door she found. The heat forced her to recoil; with a sad glance, she moved on.</p><p class="double">The next room, thankfully, wasn&#039;t hot enough to be consumed by flames. She announced herself with a quick shout--&quot;&quot;PONYVILLE FIRE DEPARTAMENT! SOMEONE PLEASE RESPOND!&quot;--and quickly entered. It turned out to be a basic bathroom, and a quick search found nopony hiding in the tub or the cabinets. The room after that, the master bedroom, had a minor blaze already; fortunately, it was unoccupied. As Quick Deployment headed to the final room, she spared a glance at the stairs; tongues of fire were already licking up. Time was running out.</p><p class="double">Quick Deployment approached the final door, pressing against it. &quot;PONYVILLE FIRE DEPARTAMENT! IS ANYONE THERE?&quot; Unlike the other doors, there was actually some kind of noise! But it wasn&#039;t just any kind of noise; it was the one kind of noise she didn&#039;t want to hear in this situation. It was the crying of an infant foal.</p><p class="double">Without thinking twice she opened the door as fast as she could, noticing that it was filled with plush animals and other didactic toys; in the centre of the room was a cradle with a small yellow earth pony foal. The baby was wailing with all his little lungs could give him; Quick Deployment could sense the flames getting closer as she carefully lifted the small bundle of joy out of the crib. But the flames were already covering the hallway and getting inside the room, she could even hear the sound of the roof collapsing in the other places of the house; the structural integrity of the building wouldn&#039;t last much longer.</p><p class="double">Quick Deployment&#039;s mind raced as she placed the oxygen mask to the foal&#039;s face, looking around quickly – there! A window! Clutching the foal tightly to her chest, she steeled herself and ran toward it, leaping out just before a burst of fire destroyed the room!</p><p class="double"><i><b>BOOOOOOOOM!!!</b></i></p><p class="double">The force sent her further then she expected, but already she was curled around the infant and rolling on the ground... into a set of bushes. She sputtered, spitting out leaves as she clambered out. &quot;I&#039;m not doing this ever again if I can help it!&quot; Her eyes drifted toward the foal, and she sighed in relief as she saw him look back with wide eyes.</p><p class="double">Moment later she was wrapped up in a tight hug.</p><p class="double">&quot;DINKY! ARE YOU ALRIGHT MUFFIN?&quot; Derpy couldn&#039;t hold back the tears as she brough both the foals close. &quot;DOES SOMETHING HURT? PLEASE SAY SOMETHING!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ms. Hooves-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;DID YOU GET BURNED? DID ANY PIECE OF DEBRIS HIT YOU?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ms. hooves, I&#039;m fi-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;PLEASE DON&#039;T TELL ME YOU&#039;RE DYING! I CAN&#039;T LOOSE YOU THE SAME WAY I LOST YOUR FATHER! PLEASE DON&#039;T LEAVE ME AND YOUR SISTER ALONE!...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;MS. HOOVES! I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT I AM FINE! FINE!&quot; The firepony broke out of the hug with an exasperated sigh. &quot;Geeze, it was just a few scrapes... and the temporal pain of hitting my back with the oxygen tank when I landed, nothing out of routine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy sniffed, giving her a worried look. &quot;...Are you sure?&quot;</p><p class="double">Quick Deployment took a breath, calming herself. &quot;Yeah I&#039;m sure of it. This is not my first fire, Ms. Hooves, and I don&#039;t think it will be my last.&quot; She looked toward the burning building. &quot;What it worries me right now is how to extinguish the fire before it propagates to the nearby houses, calm down this little tyke, find his parents, get some water to drink, and get to the hospital for a checkup after this mess. That is in order from the top priority to the least one Ms. Hooves.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Ok, I guess I can help you with the first one,&quot; Derpy finally replied. &quot;I may not be Rainbow Dash, but if there&#039;s one thing I can handle a little better than her it&#039;s storm clouds. That will put out the fire and keep the other houses humid enough to not catching fire.&quot; She gave Sugarcube Corner a glance. &quot;Or, knowing my luck, set half the other houses on fire...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, what was the last part?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NOTHING! NOTHING AT ALL! Don’t worry about it, just leave it to me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... I trust your judgement Ms. Hooves. Please be quick in gathering the storm cloud, I don&#039;t think my buddies of the station will arrive in time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy saluted. &quot;Don&#039;t worry muffin, Mom is on the case.&quot; She gave a little nuzzle to the infant – before backing off with an odd expression. &quot;Wait... is that Carrot Cake? No, never mind, I don&#039;t want to know.&quot; Shaking her head, she took to the air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Having another alicorn bow to you was a disconcerting thing for the three Founders, especially as there were four more besides, though two were clearly copies of two others. However the fire distracted every-pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;We should go there with all speed, see if we can render aid.&quot; Pansy said, trying to lift-off to see better.</p><p class="double">&quot;In our present state I&#039;m not sure...&quot; Clover&#039;s eyes alighted on a spilled bag that had once been part of a pirate costume. The candy gems inside had been transmuted into real ones, likewise the chocolate gold pieces, and her eyes brightened up. &quot;Or maybe we can!&quot;</p><p class="double">She forked through them with a hoof, and levitated three of the biggest and finest, a diamond, a sapphire and an emerald, as well as some other odds and ends. &quot;We can work on the move.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie had gone over by Princess Luna as they moved off. &quot;You seem to know us personally, but I for one have never met you. Our memories seem to extend until a dozen years after the Alliance. But from what we&#039;ve been told that was well over a thousand years ago. Also, from Rainbow&#039;s reaction you are native to this time and place. Who are you, and how can this be, if you don&#039;t mind me asking?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am Princess Luna, Ruler of Night and Guardian of Dreams, and my sister is Princess Celestia, Ruler of the Day and Protector of Ponykind. We now raise the sun and moon, rather than a team of unicorn nobles.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;But that would deprive the unicorn nobility of the largest portion of their power! That would be... it would change everything!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed it did... but that is not what you asked. You were very old when we met you, only alive because of Clover&#039;s spells, but even then you were an inspiration. We alicorns on the other hoof are immortal, or rather unaging.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean, you have lived that entire time from then to now? Then it is the two of you who are truly responsible for this world, not we... your highness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna shook her head. &quot;Only because we had your example to guide us. You, of all ponies need not use our titles. Indeed, the Elements of Harmony were a development of Clover&#039;s elaboration of Starswirl&#039;s original research into the nature of magic and it&#039;s connection to the minds and emotions of all three pony races.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Elements of Harmony?&quot; Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">Fausticorn and Clover had been talking, and casting spells on the floating gems. Finally, Clover came back to the other two carrying two chokers. The third, containing a diamond, was around her neck. &quot;Lauren agreed to lend us some of her power, and I transfered my design for a way to relay it along with my other memories. She helped craft these, and it should give all three of us at least a measure of our adult powers. She even suggested an improvement. I was too wedded to the idea of a physical ritual diagram, drawn on the ground. These form a ritual triune, but the links between the vertices use our friendship as the conduit. It&#039;s a fascinating idea, I only wish my real self could benefit from it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her expression saddened for a second, but she quickly recovered, and she put the chokers around the other two&#039;s necks, the sapphire for Pansy and the emerald for Cookie.</p><p class="double">Pansy started flapping her wings like a hummingbrd, but this time she took off like a Harrier jump-jet. &quot;Now this is more the business!&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia overheard the comment Clover made and asked, &quot;Why do you say that? You are as real as any-pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No we&#039;re not, we&#039;re simply far better copies than most. The enchantment on the costumes made us unusually detailed, but we will vanish along with the spell.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eyes widened in surprise. &quot;So that&#039;s what you meant! You told me once, that if I ever found you doubting you existed, to tell you the following phrase. &#039;He should have been called Levelhead.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover giggled. &quot;Oh that old chestnut. Smart Cookie always said her boss should be... Wait, how could we know that if we&#039;re just gestalts created by magic! That was a private thing between the three of us, we swore never to reveal it...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s horn glowed slightly. &quot;I think the spell did something different in your case, brought your souls forward in time. I can sense the difference between you and Fluttershy or Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Does that mean when the spell ends we will return to our real bodies?&quot; Hope dawned in Smart Cookie&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. &quot;It would make sense. I don&#039;t know how much you will remember, but enough to tell me that phrase to use.&quot;</p><p class="double">They&#039;d reached the burning building, which had half collapsed, and Rainbow Dash yelled out &quot;Sugar Cube Corner!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Quick Deployment gave an exasperated sigh. &quot;Great, more civili–Your Majesties!&quot; She bowed quickly, careful not to let her magical grip drop the infant she was carrying. &quot;I can personally reassure you that the building is vacated, I went through and got everypony out. One of the local pegasi is... why are there seven of you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Costume curse,&quot; Clover explained simply. &quot;As far as we can tell, everypony became their.... Nightmare Night, was it? Nightmare Night costumes...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance picked the infant up gently, rocking him to sleep and giving a reassuring wing hug to the shivering alicorn filly she had been tending to. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, Erroria, this brave firepony managed to save everyone in the blaze.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t like fire,&quot; the filly sniffled, unaware of her glowing horn. &quot;I want it gone!&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire area was suddenly subjected to a three second deluge. Founder, alicorn, mummy, and firepony all stood, blinking the water out of their eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Quick Deployment said slowly. &quot;I... guess that&#039;s one way to put out a fire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy glided down, mussing up the firepony&#039;s mane. &quot;Did I do that? I&#039;m sorry! I didn&#039;t mean to!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aaaaaand now I&#039;m disintegrating,&quot; Dash deadpanned. &quot;Great.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice trailed off in a gurgle as she collapsed in a heap of sodden linen and bones before every-pony&#039;s horrified gaze. The pile <i>rippled</i>, and suddenly it was a regular blue pegasus swathed in soaking toilet paper. She spat out a mouthful. &quot;Ugh! The toilet paper should be on the houses, not me! Never doing that again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course!&quot; Clover exclaimed. &quot;The curse changes you into your costume, so damage done to your assumed form is damage done <b>to</b> the costume! So even if your costume form is killed or destroyed, all that happens is you revert to normal with a wrecked costume. Ingenious!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss,&quot; Smart Cookie asked the fire-pony, &quot;Did you see some sort of statue or bust in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to the group. &quot;What does this Discord creature look like anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy was up in the air, converting the steam rising off the smouldering wreckage into clouds and chilling them to suck the last remnants of heat out of the destroyed building. &quot;It must have been pretty durable to survive this, and it must have. We&#039;re still here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia was casting about with her horn, looking like a giant white bloodhound. &quot;It&#039;s possible it didn&#039;t need to. The aura of Chaos magic is strong, but it&#039;s not centred inside the building. It seems to lead off towards the Everfree Forest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, that about figures!&quot; grumbled Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sister, thou do believe some villain absconded with it and set the place afire the place to cover his tracks?&quot; Luna asked. &quot;Then we must give chase with all haste!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked at the wrapped up foal Cadance was currently holding which had been saved from the fire, and raised an eyebrow. Carrot Cake should be a full-grown stallion, baker, and warden... er... employer of Pinkie Pie; and yet there he was as an infant. She chalked it down to more weirdness from the spell.</p><p class="double">All the now dry alicorns and founders were setting up a spell to better locate the perpetrator of the fire. All the alicorns except the small filly which Rainbow had never seen before.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello. So, who might you be?&quot; The newly demummified pegasus asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Erroria,&quot; said the filly alicorn, &quot;Do you know where my mother is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who is your mother, little one?&quot; Quick Deployment asked after looking sadly at the wet remains of the bakery. She was used to working with a full team of mixed ponies to put out fires before they got this bad. Ideally, there would also be a few fully-laden rainclouds on hoof at the station.</p><p class="double">Erroria thought for a little while before remembering, &quot;My mother is Princess Skyla!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash spoke up, &quot;And do you know your grandmother&#039;s name?&quot;</p><p class="double">The little alicorn filly thought for a moment. Then she pointed at the alicorn who was holding the foal, &quot;Grandma Candy!&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Cadance stopped rocking the foal as her eyes shrunk down to pinpricks.</p><p class="double">Rainbow&#039;s wings fluttered as comprehension hit her, &quot;Right. Princess Cadence&#039;s granddaughter. From the future. With everything else crazy around here, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Any luck with tracing the statue?&quot; the actual Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">Luna turned around with a smile, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr><hr></p><p class="double">It had finished the cookbook it had been compelled to write, and cast the appropriate protection spells on the tome. Fluttering out of the window, the fungal creature had skittered around the chaos outside, casually pulling information of the local language from the minds of several of the afflicted. That was when it overheard what was happening. There was a chance it could simply stop existing once the aetherial conflagration was through; and that was unacceptable.</p><p class="double">Once it was back at the bakery, the focal point statue was easy to locate. Snatching it up in its claws, the Mi-go fluttered out the window. A brief burst of personal power later, and everything in the room, except the cookbook, was on fire.</p><p class="double">Half-flying, half scuttling in the wild magic forest with the statue, distracted by deflecting scrying spells; it never noticed that something was watching it.</p><p class="double">Right up until a small furry foot impacted it in the back of its head. Its last thought before losing consciousness was that of confusion. How was it possible that it was hit with far more force that a bandana and war-paint wearing white rabbit had any right to wield?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Quick, this way!&quot; Luna took off in the Everfree Forest&#039;s direction, and her companions quickly followed suit.</p><p class="double">The group of ponies, increasingly consisting of alicorns, soon reached the forest&#039;s outskirts, where a... creature, part fungus, part shrimp and part... something, was rising from the dirt, hissing and swinging its tail at-</p><p class="double">&quot;Angel Bunny!&quot; Nightmare Moon&#039;s gaze shifted mid-sentence. &quot;Well, done, master ra- No! Bad bunny! I mean, no! Well done, Angel! I mean- Oh, wilst thou DECIDE, ALREADY!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny gave the mare a confused look, but then puffed out his chest and adjusted his bandanna, after which he turned around to face the Mi-Go again – who was in the middle of trying to sneak away. For its trouble, it received a bunny kick to the shin – or... whatever that was – and doubled over backwards.</p><p class="double">While Nightmare Moon was still bickering with herself, Lauren stepped forward and looked the strange creature over. &quot;Nah, Lovecraftian horrors don&#039;t really fit a setting intended for young audiences.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ignoring their creator&#039;s avatar&#039;s shadow&#039;s comment, Tia stepped forward and took a telekinetic hold of the statuette of Discord in the Mi-Go&#039;s claws – or better tried to, as suddenly the creature leapt up and whipped around, its wings buzzing for take-off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Smart Cookie took a far more direct approach. &quot;Clover, give me a boost!&quot;</p><p class="double">She jumped, and a burst of magic flung her at the creature, dropping her on its back and bearing it to the ground. Lieutenant Pansy helped to pony-pile the thing, and a glow of magic pressed it against the floor, binding it to the ground as Clover added her efforts to restraining the thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s... still fighting!&quot; She said. &quot;Someone needs to destroy that statue now! Lauren, it&#039;s been a privilege and a pleasure. I hope the story you write brings joy to many fillies and colts. Princesses, I speak for us all when I say, thank you for continuing our work.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a chorus of agreement from the other two.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lauren picked up the statue in her magic. She giggled for a moment as it hovered and glowed. &quot;Hee hee, I&#039;m Jean Grey! Alright, alright, don&#039;t give me that look. Time for serious--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You would kill children?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren froze.</p><p class="double">&quot;I do not claim to find anything wrong in it,&quot; Chrksxcin continued calmly. &quot;But I know by your morality it is... odd. Destroying that statue would eliminate the personae that they have taken. The spawn, in particular, must concern you.&quot; It nodded toward Cadance, who was shielding her potential granddaughter and the regressed Carrot Cake with her wings. &quot;And that is only amongst those you are aware of. Certainly, it would be far less... disturbing to leave it untouched?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow snorted. &quot;Hey, I turned back to normal easy peasy. It&#039;s not going to kill anypony if she--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were still who you were,&quot; the Mi-Go countered, &quot;if different in form. And perhaps it could be argued that these three will return, so all the replicas of truth will be sent back with only confusion. But what of you and I?&quot; It turned back to Lauren. &quot;We have no home. We are constructs. And how many in that town are constructs themselves? We will melt away. Do you truly want that much of reality to cease?&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn looked at the statue in her magical grip.</p><p class="double">&quot;...If I had a choice,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I would take the constructed identities and make them separate bodies. But... I don&#039;t know how to do that. And if I could I would go out and ask every one of them if they would accept this. But... right here, right now... you and I are dangerous. In very different ways, yeah, but I don&#039;t...&quot; She shivered. &quot;I... I can&#039;t--&quot;</p><p class="double">Unexpectedly the statue sighed and snapped its fingers, metamorphosing into a multicoloured chimera with a grumpy frown. &quot;Let me just cut off all the drama here: The spell only lasts until sunlight hits the costume. The statue never had anything to do with ending it. Oh, and the constructed personae are actually facets of the costume makers and will rejoin with their mind when they disappear. Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I need to go see what chaos is happening in Ponyville. Ta-ta!&quot; He walked off from the stunned onlookers.</p><p class="double">Eventually Celestia facehooved. &quot;Of course Discord would pull something like that. Gruuugh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The solution is clear,&quot; Chrksxcin said calmly. &quot;You and I merely need to avoid sunlight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, sure, you know what?&quot; The red maned alicorn snorted. &quot;You do that. I&#039;ve just been put through an emotional wringer and then told it didn&#039;t even matter.&quot; She stomped off, muttering curses under her breath.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Smart Cookie cleared her throat. &quot;Does this mean we should let this thing go?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So it was true, after all,&quot; the false day alicorn said as she tested her wings after they started to brighten, realizing they had lost some sensibility and were much more difficult to move. &quot;I&#039;m just an illusion or an echo of a memory, am I not?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna and Celestia stopped and looked to the fake alicorn but she was looking at the moon in the sky, her eyes with unshed tears. &quot;Please, there&#039;s no need to hide it for me. I may recognize we are near the Everfree forest but there are so many things I don&#039;t understand about tonight, starting with both of you and this Ponyville. And since I&#039;m just an illusion then it means it won&#039;t matter if I do this.&quot; Then the fake Celestia threw herself to Luna, crying and hugging her fiercely. &quot;Lulu! I thought I&#039;d never see you again, sister. I&#039;m so happy to see you like this, so grown up!&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna just hugged and petted back.</p><p class="double">Letting go slightly of Luna, the ensorcelled Celestia looked to the real one. &quot;And you, real me, I don&#039;t know how much what&#039;s worth the opinion of your echo but thank you. I envy you so much but now I can disappear with no regrets.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia just shook her head. &quot;Don&#039;t thank me, I didn&#039;t do anything. It took a new set of Element bearers to help Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then please give my thanks to them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna contained her giggle into a lopsided smile, mimicking Celestia&#039;s own expression &quot;Will do Celly, we promise.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well that was certainly interesting,” Twilight muttered to herself. “It’s definitely going in my... hmm.. top fifty weirdest loops. Well, at least it’s over now.”</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the library door. She stood up and walked over, opening it to find the worried faces of three cutie mark crusaders.</p><p class="double">“Hey there girls! What’s going on?”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shifted a hoof, giving her an awkward glance. “You know how we... well, the founders made necklaces to boost their power?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Yeah... they didn’t transform back to candy, did they?”</p><p class="double">“...No,” Scootaloo confirmed. “They didn’t. But it gets weirder.”</p><p class="double">“Really? How?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle pulled the necklaces out of her saddlebags. “Well... when we wear them, we can hear... voices.”</p><p class="double">Raising an eyebrow, Twilight took the necklaces and ran a quick check over them for dangerous magic before slipping one on.</p><p class="double"><i>As far as I can tell, Cookie, that spell I had the alicorn cast that night dragged our souls forward after we died. No, Pansy, I don’t think it’s reversible! Oh, wait, I’m being worn. Hello there! I’m Clover, yes, that Clover, it’s a long story...</i></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='37'></a><h3>Loops 35</h3>
<p>35.1</p><p class="double">“Okay, I have a plan,” Twilight said, looking around at the assembled loopers. “Well, more of a competition, really.”</p><p class="double">“Go on...” Dash said, ears perking up.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Basically, we each take a turn handling all the big, important problems – solo. One Loop each.” Twilight paused for effect. “And we&#039;re only allowed to use our base-line abilities, plus the powers from at most <i>one</i> other loop.”</p><p class="double">Spike raised a claw. “Does my size-shifting count?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but it&#039;s that or the Force. Not both.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I think I see...” Rarity nodded. “You&#039;re trying to make it as equal as possible, dear?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Not fair that I have an advantage just for having looped so much longer than the rest of you – well, except in that I might be quite a lot more sneaky.”</p><p class="double">“As if,” Trixie said.</p><p class="double">That caused everypony, -ling, -dragon, -griffin and even -bunny to give her an incredulous look. (Discord was drinking upside-down tea, and didn&#039;t react.)</p><p class="double">“...I <i>might</i> not have been talking about myself,” Trixie said, slowly and carefully.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis hummed. “Do I count as automatically defeating myself?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but you don&#039;t get points for style unless you do it <i>with</i> style.” Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s going to be fairly normal for our loops,” Nyx said, nodding up at Luna. “Didn&#039;t you once take over the world, then give it back five minutes later &#039;cause there wasn&#039;t enough cheese?”</p><p class="double">Luna made a small gesture with one hoof. “I do try.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Shining Armor said. “Here goes.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned at him. “Go get &#039;er, B.B.B.F.F. I checked – she&#039;s not Awake.”</p><p class="double">“Good.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon finished her speech, cackled a bit, and flared her wings for effect.</p><p class="double">Two guards steadied their spears and prepared to charge-</p><p class="double">“Stand down, men,” a voice said.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll handle this.”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” she said, coming back to all fours and looking the unicorn stallion up and down, with a measuring glance. “One of Celestia&#039;s guard-whelps?”</p><p class="double">“Captain Shining Armor, at her service.” Shining saluted smartly.</p><p class="double">“How touching,” Nightmare Moon said, and launched a dark-bolt at him.</p><p class="double">Something very peculiar happened, and a dark-bolt hit her in the side, with enough power to smash her off her hooves.</p><p class="double">She came back upright with a fluid grace, and snarled. “What just happened?”</p><p class="double">Shining smiled. “I couldn&#039;t possibly comment.”</p><p class="double">“Insolent-” Biting off the word harshly, she gathered more power and fired a spread of over a dozen seeker bolts, paying more attention this time. His horn was faintly glowing-</p><p class="double">Seeker bolts hit her in all four kneecaps, then her flanks, both wings, and the last five shot holes through her mane.</p><p class="double">“How did you do that?” she asked, flaring her wings and righting herself.</p><p class="double">“Justice will be done,” he replied enigmatically.</p><p class="double">More magic. This time, it was a single overpowered electron ram.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was less surprised than she felt she should have been when an overpowered electron ram erupted from the stage beneath her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Shining Armor checked his gleaming uniform, frowned, and rubbed at some of the brightwork for a moment to clear off a near-invisible stain.</p><p class="double">“Hm...”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the two of them, then sidled over to her brother. “What have you been doing?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon said something unintelligible, and fell over.</p><p class="double">“Justice field,” Shining said, proudly. “I managed to get it to work just a few loops ago – so that&#039;s the one I&#039;m using, by the way. Basically, it turns back any offensive act on the perpetrator.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight looked the exhausted, heavily bruised alicorn over. “Any limits?”</p><p class="double">“Magic cost, immobility and that it doesn&#039;t discriminate,” he answered promptly. “I&#039;m working on them.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry, Rarity!” shouted the non-Looping Spike, brandishing a shovel. “I&#039;ll save you!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, Spike, don&#039;t-”</p><p class="double">Spike hit Nightmare Moon square on the back of the head with the shovel, grinned proudly, and fell over.</p><p class="double">“...oops,” Shining said guiltily. “Perhaps I should have warned him...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“I hate clever ponies,” Discord mumbled, from his current form on the floor.</p><p class="double">He was a suit of armour, as it happened.</p><p class="double">Shining shrugged. “Justice just is.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. “How long have you been waiting to tell that pun?”</p><p class="double">“About five months.”</p><p class="double">“Aha!” Discord said abruptly, and turned back into his normal self. “If I do things to you, it rebounds on me! So if I try to turn you into a draconequus, I&#039;m back!”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Shining nodded. “That is a disadvantage of the field, I will admit. It should be noted, however, that you can&#039;t actually do anything to anyone else while it&#039;s up.”</p><p class="double">Discord shrugged. “I can wait.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t think you can, actually,” Twilight replied. “I mean, you&#039;re seriously telling me <i>you</i> can sit there quietly and not do anything for five minutes?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Discord said. “Just watch me!”</p><p class="double">Brother and sister watched him.</p><p class="double">Ten seconds later, he threw back his head, shouted “I can&#039;t take it any more!” and turned himself back into a statue.</p><p class="double">“...that ended well,” Shining muttered.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and flared her horn. The statue vanished.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d you put it?” Shining asked, dropping the field.</p><p class="double">“Pinkie&#039;s room. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll sort itself out one way or another.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Darling...” Cadence said, frowning into one of the side rooms. “Why is there a maid staring devotedly at her own reflection?”</p><p class="double">Shining shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, I give up. He&#039;s been doing the dark magic thing for ten minutes, and I can&#039;t see any difference in either of us.”</p><p class="double">With a flash of magic, Shining dropped the justice field.</p><p class="double">Sombra simply stood there, horn gently glowing.</p><p class="double">Then started to snore.</p><p class="double">Shining blinked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I <i>see</i>,” Twilight said, nodding. “I think he just drained his own energy to the point he fell asleep.”</p><p class="double">Shining trotted over and poked the King&#039;s flank. No response.</p><p class="double">“What should we do with him?”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought. “I tend to put him in the cellars and lock the door, really... those doors have good locks.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.2 (Mandemon)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">This new loop had been... strange. Twilight could not put her hoof on what was wrong, but something was. She had narrowed it down to Celestia and Pinkie Pie, who didn&#039;t seem to be themselves. Yet, she could not find any proof of that they were Awake or had been replaced by someone. This loops&#039; memories provided no information that would differentiate from a vanilla loop.</p><p class="double">In the end, it didn’t matter. Pinkie Pie might throw an extra party here and there, and Celestia might have been running few extra gambits. Nothing major, so she left it be. One major difference really in this loop was that her brother had embarked on some campaign that she could not find any information. At the moment, she was at the Grand Galloping Gala, having prevented the worst mistakes, and was letting the party go on smoothly. The orchestra was playing some music piece she was not interested in.</p><p class="double">Then everything went to Tartatrus.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie appeared on the window.</p><p class="double">“THIS QUIET OFFENDS SLAANESH!” She shouted on top of her lungs, causing everyone to look at her. A massive tank burst through the wall, carrying equally massive speakers. “THINGS SHALL GET LOUD NOW!” A loud music began play from the speakers, pushing ponies back. She was about to do something about the matter, when she noticed something... interesting.</p><p class="double">Celestia had just transported another massive set of speakers and DJ-equipment into the room. At the same time, Vinyl Scratch entered, listened for a moment before shrugging and moving to the DJ-booth and began to play her own music.</p><p class="double">“YOU INTERRUPT!?” Pinkie Pie shouted in surprise</p><p class="double">“You call that music? THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT!” Vinyl shouted back before starting to drown out Pinkies music. Pinkie Pie grinned and Twilight witnessed the begin of Grand DJ-Battle.</p><p class="double">She walked to Celestia.</p><p class="double">“Want to tell me me the truth.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe, maybe not?” Celestia merely said, grinning.</p><p class="double">“That’s Tzeentch, pink one is Slaanesh,” A voice answered next to Twilight. She looked next to her and saw Chrysalis. “Name&#039;s Nurgle, how do you do?” Chrysalis, AKA Nurgle, asked, sipping some weird drink.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tzeentch? Slaanesh? Oh, the Chaos Gods. I guess that means Lemon Rush is somewhere too,&quot; Twilight said. Both Nurgle and Tzeentch gave a laugh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lemon Rush? Is that what you call Leman Russ? Oh boy, he is not going to hear end of this ever,&quot; Nurgle said, offering Twilight a drink.</p><p class="double">“I would not drink the punch while Nurgle is here. There is probably AIDS in it,” Tzeentch commented.</p><p class="double">“You offend me, my friend. OF COURSE there is AIDS in there, Nurgle said, offended. &quot;I just want to spread my love for people!&quot; Twilight merely looked between two, before sighing.</p><p class="double">“Anything else I should know?” she asked.</p><p class="double">“Your brother is currently building a Skull Throne from the skulls of... well, pretty much anything,” Nurgle said, earning a glare from Tzeentch. “What? Did I throw a wrench into your plans?”</p><p class="double">“You’re impossible,” Tzeentch said.</p><p class="double">“Oh, shut up, newbie, I have been existing much longer than any of you,” Nurgle said, taking another sip.</p><p class="double">“A Skull Throne?” Twilight asked, mentally cataloguing alternative Element bearers.</p><p class="double">“He’s Khorne. Khorne disapproves the lack of wanton violence.” Tzeentch said, before smiling. “I wonder what he thinks once he realizes that things he has been hunting are actually merely illusions.”</p><p class="double">At the moment, Braeburn walked in.</p><p class="double">“Been looking for you idiots,” he said, walking up to Tzeentch and Nurgle.</p><p class="double">“Empy, how you do? Had a fun loop?” Nurgle said in delight. “Come on, give me a hug!”</p><p class="double">Some hours lat,er Slaanesh and Vinyl Scratch were staring each other down. Both music systems had burned out, though &quot;Empy&quot;, AKA Emperor, had mentioned that Slaneesh should have been able to fix his/her/its system, but apparently decided to be a good sport. The two brohoofed and swore to have another go in near future. After Vinyl left, Slaanesh walked to the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks Tze, that was fun!&quot; she said. &quot;I love these loops, you always find people who perfect their trade.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I did own you one for the aid pulling that prank on Chtulhu. The upstart needed a lesson.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just wished the loop would end soon. Having five gods running around with entirely different moral system was not going to be fun.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked to the garden, where she saw Tzeentch and Slaneesh watching over the statue of Discord.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no, you are <i>not</i> waking him up. We had a deal, remember? No funny business and I won&#039;t kick your butts,&quot; She said to the two Chaos gods.</p><p class="double">&quot;Funny business?&quot; Tzeentch asked. &quot;Oh, this isn&#039;t one of those. Just doing something she insisted.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on Tzeensy, you know we have responsibility?&quot; Slaanesh said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Chaos God of debauchery, excess, pleasure, pain and selfishness lectures me of responsibility. Clearly the multiverse has a sick sense of humour.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, time up. Please explain to semi-mortal what is going on?&quot; Twilight managed to get out before the statue of Discord disappeared and confused Discord sat in it&#039;s place.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm? I&#039;m free? FREE AT LAST! MUAHAAHAA!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem, Discord?&quot; Tzeentch said, causing Discord to freeze in his place, before his head turned 180 degree to meet the eyes of two Chaos Gods.</p><p class="double">&quot;Weird, I could have sworn I heard-&quot; Slaanesh and Tzeentch abandoned their pony forms and took their &quot;standardized&quot; forms. &quot;Oh... Hello?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings. I am Tzeentch and this Slaanesh. We are here to teach you about how to do Chaos.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot; Discord managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You see, we think you are quite too... euclidean with your thing. Chocolate rain, really? What&#039;s the fun in <i>that</i>? Now, Chocolate that rains clouds that do not exist, while at the same time sing ode to Ice Cream, now there is the thing. Though you still need to make so that they occupy at least four locations at the same time,&quot; Slaanesh said. &quot;Now, you come with me and I shall teach you a trick or two.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HEY WAIT WHAT THE LET GO OFF ME STOP THAT-&quot; Discord shouted, while being dragged by an ear by Slaanesh. Twilight merely stared at the spectacle in front of her, before turning to Tzeentch who once again took the form of Celestia.</p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a long story. Slaanesh and Cegorach had this... fight over the soul of Harlequin. So, this one of the Slaanesh demons decides to give a try, in hopes of advancing in the ranks and tries to bring Slaanesh some drinks. Too bad I mixed them.” Tzeentch winked. “So, after taking a sip, Slaanesh threw the remainders at Cegorach, both suddenly found themselves very hot and bothered and when two Gods love each others very much-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Skip please.&quot; Twilight made a face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, Cegorach came to me and asked me for a help to solve this mess, since I caused it. In exchange of some... shall we say, favours, I agreed to fool Slaanesh. So when Slaanesh comes, having worst hangover <i>ever, </i>I took responsibility, making Khrone <i>very</i> pissed for no good reason.&quot; Tzeentch gave a snicker at this. &quot;Anyway, few millennium later we got this tiny Chaos God running around. However, Khrone got tired of the little runt after that incident with Slaanesh toys and his weapons and threw him into a rift in Chaos. Since then, for who knows reason, Slaanesh has claimed every single chaos elemental as her &#039;children&#039; and wants to teach them. And somehow I am to help her. Because I am the Daddy. I guess it&#039;s one those... well, can&#039;t really say &#039;Lady things&#039; but you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that explains... actually quite a lot.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, how much you are ready to pay to me that I don&#039;t reveal this to Slaanesh?&quot; Twilight said with a grin. Tzeentch face fell.</p><p class="double">&quot;You wouldn&#039;t dare?&quot;</p><p class="double">“Try me.&quot; </p><p class="double">The two stared each other for a moment, before Tzeentch gave a chuckle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remind me to show you around the Black Library next time you visit.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Four young children walked through the snowy pine forest, faces alight with wonder.</p><p class="double">This was really inside a wardrobe?</p><p class="double">A purple flash lit the snow in front of them.</p><p class="double">“Hello,” said a strange being, like a horse but with both wings and a horn. “Sorry I took so long, I don&#039;t know my way around here very well... aherm.”</p><p class="double">The apparition fluffed her wings – for the voice was clearly that of a her – and cleared her throat again. “Welcome, human children. I am Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re what?” asked the younger of the boys. “That&#039;s an absurd name.”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle looked at him, then examined her own wings. “Fair enough. I&#039;m a bit of an absurd being, by your standards. Anyway... as one of your number has already noticed, this world contains creatures with wit and voice, unlike your home. Long story short, I&#039;ve finally got here, and I&#039;m about to fix the weather.”</p><p class="double">She spread her wings, and light gathered itself about her horn.</p><p class="double">The sun rose, and it felt like a warm balm. It reminded the children more of midsummer than midwinter.</p><p class="double">“That should do it,” she muttered. “Now, where&#039;s Jadis... oh, where are my manners? There&#039;s a family of rather hospitable beavers around two hundred and fifty feet that way.”</p><p class="double">With that, the strange horse took to the air and winged away west.</p><p class="double">The children exchanged looks.</p><p class="double">“Well, I suppose we should have a look,” the eldest finally suggested.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Jadis looked out from her sled. “Where is that Son of Adam?”</p><p class="double">There was a ping next to her.</p><p class="double">“Yoink, yoink, yoink,” a voice said, accompanied by three pops, and then a final loud pop sounded just as she turned with wand raised.</p><p class="double">Something seemed wrong.</p><p class="double">“...where did my reindeer and drover go?”</p><p class="double">Gathering her power, Jadis prepared for battle. The response was near-instinct after a hundred years of ruling Narnia – for she was but one woman, be she ever so powerful, and Narnia did not take to the yoke well.</p><p class="double">It was time for another sweep with the wolves, if some resistance movement or other had begun again...</p><p class="double">At that point, a rock the size of a large house and travelling at two thousand metres per second arrived, which rather put an end to the plans Jadis was making in an emphatically final way.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>And that should take care of that,</i> Twilight thought to herself.</p><p class="double">Admittedly, she wasn&#039;t sure on whether Jadis was capable of coming back – the fourth book suggested that she never really entirely died even when eaten by a lion – but this should be good enough.</p><p class="double">One thing Twilight was not willing to allow was for that woman to be capable of her usual magic. She didn&#039;t know, nor want to know, how the Deplorable Word worked, but since the last time Jadis had killed that spell everyone else in the same reality had died...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, anyway, she&#039;s not coming back,” Twilight explained to a number of large, well-armed monsters.</p><p class="double">“You have killed the White Witch?” a dwarf asked.</p><p class="double">“Not entirely sure,” Twilight admitted. “But no matter how powerful the witch, a meteorite between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp her style.”</p><p class="double">She paused. “Basically, at this point I think there&#039;s supposed to be a big battle, but I think we may as well just skip straight to the peace treaty. I&#039;m going to go ahead and offer equal citizenship with a four year delay. Two years if one of the animals or other creatures not involved with Jadis vouches for you.”</p><p class="double">They mulled that over.</p><p class="double">While they did, Twilight fired off another spell. “Mass stone to flesh!”</p><p class="double">She consulted a mental check list. Sort out the winter, check... White Witch, check... her army, check... stoned statues, check...</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Anyway,” Twilight said, standing on a dais in Cair Paravel a week later as the songbird orchestra died away. “I have no particular desire to make myself ruler over you all without consultation, and it is also known that prophecy says Narnia does well with human rulers...”</p><p class="double">She winked. “But I have certain issues with prophecy. So, I will introduce to you an idea with which these human children are well familiar. It is called a constitutional monarchy.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh great Tisroc (may your name be blesséd), we have the Narnian reply to your entirely reasonable suggestion that their barbarian nation submit to your blessed rule and become part of Calormene,&quot; a functionary droned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, let&#039;s have it, you unworthy worm!&quot;</p><p class="double">The heavily bejewelled potentate read the scroll out loud.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;From the United Kingdoms of Narnia, Archenland, Terebithia, and the Lone Islands to the Tisroc, Ruler of all Calormene.</p><p class="double">Go outside on your balcony and look up...&#039; What foolishness is this?&quot;</p><p class="double">The light from outside dimmed slightly and he looked out, and up at the sky. The reason for the darkness was obvious enough, a solar eclipse was hardly inconspicuous. White faced, he read the rest of the scroll.</p><p class="double">&#039;That&#039;s our answer. Any questions?</p><p class="double">High King Peter, King Edmund, Minister of Justice, Queen Susan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Queen Lucy, Minster of Health</p><p class="double">PP Secretary Twilight Sparkle, Royal Archivist and part time magical super-weapon.&#039; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Goodness,” Susan said, as the four Pevensies picked themselves up from the beach. “So, we are back in Narnia.”</p><p class="double">“It hasn&#039;t changed a bit,” Lucy sighed, looking up at the castle of Cair Paravel towering over them.</p><p class="double">“Are you sure?” Edmund asked, in a strange voice.</p><p class="double">The others turned to see where he was looking.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Peter said in a small voice, as two airships dumped ballast and set out east for the Lonely Islands.</p><p class="double">“Hello!” Twilight said, cantering over from the beach stairs. “Sorry, I should have been here sooner. And sorry for the culture shock, as well – I&#039;m afraid we rather kept inventing things without you. There&#039;s good news, though – you&#039;re not the only humans here any more. Come along, the Parliament will want to meet you!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Well, that was... exhausting,” Peter said, flopping down on the grass of the tourney field.</p><p class="double">“Who was that you were fighting?” Edmund asked.</p><p class="double">“Caspian, of course.” Peter rolled his eyes. “This new royal family is like the French Kings from our world – they always have the same name.”</p><p class="double">“I like him,” Susan said, looking across the field. “Much nicer than that Rabadash fellow from last time. Oh – where is the archery tournament?”</p><p class="double">“The next field over, I think,” Edmund replied promptly. “Lu already went over there.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">A boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb – and please do not laugh, though he is used to it – hurried towards a cave as rain began to fall.</p><p class="double">With a loud pop, Twilight appeared in the valley. “Oh, hello! Sorry, we haven&#039;t met. My name&#039;s Twilight... sorry I couldn&#039;t meet you sooner, I&#039;m afraid there was a terrible argument going on with some giants.”</p><p class="double">Eustace stared at her.</p><p class="double">Twilight waved, blushing. “Yes, I know, it can be a bit overwhelming. Anyway. I should warn you that sleeping on a dragon&#039;s hoard – like the one in the cave – will turn you into a dragon. It can be undone, but... I just thought I&#039;d warn you. Later!”</p><p class="double">She vanished with another pop.</p><p class="double">Eustace sat down just inside the cave, and thought carefully.</p><p class="double">On the one hand, he was quite overwhelmed by this Narnia place. From the strange, creaking paddle wheels and sails of the Dawn Treader – and should those really go together? - to the casual acceptance amongst the crew of that ship that a phoenix sat under the boiler and three naiads controlled the sails, Narnia was very foreign to his picture of how the world should work.</p><p class="double">On the other hand, dragons were pretty cool.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">With a series of skittering splashes, a lot of dragon landed in the surf.</p><p class="double">“Hullo!” he said, sculling over to the frigate as it rode at anchor. “Flying is super!”</p><p class="double">“Is that Eustace?” Caspian asked, staring over the starboard paddle.</p><p class="double">“Yes.” The dragon waved. “It&#039;s a little strange, but I like lizards. Would anyone like a ride?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight ticked two more boxes on her checklist.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Oh, so that&#039;s how it works!” Twilight said, slamming a book shut. “Oog. Well, at least that explains a few things...”</p><p class="double">She lit her horn, and got casting.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">An extremely irritated-looking mouse glared balefully up at Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Oh, don&#039;t give me that,” Twilight admonished. “I did revive you... eventually... and given what you were going to do I think I was rather nicer than you deserve.”</p><p class="double">The mouse flipped a claw at her.</p><p class="double">“None of that.” Twilight spun the cage and gave its occupant a look. “Or can you honestly tell me you wouldn&#039;t cast the Deplorable Word the moment you had a functioning voicebox?”</p><p class="double">Jadis the otherwise-normal mouse (who was most definitely not a Mouse) squeaked something which was probably her best attempt at obscenity.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“See the lantern?” the lady of the green kirtle said, as thick, sweet smoke wove around the heads of the friends. “The sun is just what you think of when you think of a big lantern. There is only the lantern, there is no real sun.”</p><p class="double">Eustace nodded heavily. “That&#039;s logical. What about the flying unicorn?”</p><p class="double">The lady of the green kirtle frowned. “Er... a big pony?”</p><p class="double">“Little pony, thank you,” Twilight said, walking in the door and coughing. “Faugh, this is awful stuff.”</p><p class="double">She pointed a hoof at the lady, clearing the air with two powerful wingbeats. “You lot. People like you are why running this place is a full time job, I swear.”</p><p class="double">The lady hissed, and turned into a giant serpent.</p><p class="double">“Now that&#039;s mature.” Twilight&#039;s horn flared, and both serpent and alicorn vanished.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">With a colossal splash, fifty feet of serpent landed in the sea to the east of Dragon Island.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight ported back into the Lady&#039;s chambers. “Okay, done. Anyone who doesn&#039;t want to get straight back to Narnia, please leave the room now.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">With a certain proprietary pride, Twilight watched the pillar of flame climb skywards from Cape Paravel.</p><p class="double">Certainly, Celestia might have taught her, and she might have had experience with Equestria, but this was her first time with responsibility for an entire country that she hadn&#039;t had the experience with being a subject of first.</p><p class="double">All things considered, a space program was a pretty good achievement for a first try.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.2 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy closed her eyes for a moment, flinching at the sounds coming in the window, then her expression firmed.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m not just cowardly Fluttershy. Not any more.</i></p><p class="double">She pushed off the covers and got out of bed.</p><p class="double">“Angel? Be a dear and ask the ponies trying to destroy the town with pure music to turn it down a bit?”</p><p class="double">Several lapine stomps tracked across the floor, followed by a bang which shook the house.</p><p class="double">The pegasus smiled gently. Angel was such a grumpy bunny sometimes.</p><p class="double">“Okay, who&#039;s hungry?”</p><p class="double"><i>“Not me, thanks,” </i>the pelican said.</p><p class="double">Several hummingbirds started piping for nectar, speaking over one another in their high voices.</p><p class="double">“All right, I&#039;ll get to you in a minute,” Fluttershy said, rapping the ground with her hoof and causing a vine to burst forth. Moving at walking pace, it spread over the eaves of her house before budding and flowering in a pulse of honeysuckle scent.</p><p class="double">Most of the animals stared at her. (The hummingbirds, more pragmatic or just hungrier, got stuck in.)</p><p class="double">She waved back with a broad smile, and began boosting her herb garden.</p><p class="double">Druids were really good at gardening.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Whistling an old song Spike had taught her once about a harper and her dragonets, Fluttershy packed together some lunches for whenever they were needed in the coming loop.</p><p class="double">As she rolled up a pancake with slices of cucumber and lilypad, there was a knock at the door.</p><p class="double">“Coming,” she said quietly, putting the food down and trotting over.</p><p class="double">Upon opening the door, she saw a bright yellow earth pony colt flanked by two adorably fuzzy wolf cubs.</p><p class="double">She blinked. “Is that...”</p><p class="double">“Little mother!” The colt crouched down and launched himself at her, throwing his forelegs about her neck. The two wolves joined him, and all four went over in a tangle of limbs.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled. “Lemon, it&#039;s good to see you.”</p><p class="double">“And you, little mother.” Lemon Rush – normally Leman Russ, primarch of the Space Wolves – clambered off her, and looked around her house. “It&#039;s been too long since I&#039;ve been here.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus rolled over and pushed herself upright, then nuzzled him. “I haven&#039;t seen you in too long either, Lemon. How are you?”</p><p class="double">Rush sighed. “Well, we&#039;ve picked up a lot more loopers recently. Father, or the Emperor, or whatever his real name is, started looping a few thousand ago... and all that&#039;s done is make it weirder.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy made some tea. Black for Rush; herbal for her; and Freki and Geri got gravy. (She&#039;d designed it herself. The wolves certainly seemed to give it their approval.)</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Rush said with a grateful smile, taking a sip. “Nobody does it like you do. Anyway, at least one of my brothers started looping soon afterwards – do you remember Vulkan?” Fluttershy nodded, and he went on. “That was a huge help. And I needed it...”</p><p class="double">After a long sigh, and some more tea, he looked up.</p><p class="double">“The four Chaos Gods started looping.”</p><p class="double">The gentle pegasus winced.</p><p class="double">“I know! Sure, they&#039;re not nearly as bad, now... I think they&#039;re suffering the reverse version of... what did your friend call it, Sakura syndrome?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. “Reverse version? So they&#039;re just... bored of all the chaos?”</p><p class="double">A shrug. “Basically. Or at least mass-death chaos. The galaxy&#039;s a safer place, now, but it&#039;s also a lot harder to keep track of – and when you consider normal for us, that&#039;s saying a lot...”</p><p class="double">Freki padded over to Fluttershy and gave her a pleading look.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” she said, and mixed up another two cups.</p><p class="double">Once that was done, she smiled. “I have something... nice, to show you.”</p><p class="double">She blurred, and once that was done an adult wolf stood where she had.</p><p class="double">Rush looked the wolf up and down, slowly and carefully. “Little mother?”</p><p class="double">The wolf nodded.</p><p class="double">“...that&#039;s so cool! Come on, boys, playtime!”</p><p class="double">Freki, Geri and Rush all pounced.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy skipped back, letting the wolves miss, then caught Rush&#039;s mane gently between her teeth and plopped him on the ground again.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not winning that easily!” Rush laughed, spinning to face her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Angel Bunny tromped home.</p><p class="double">On hearing the barks and laughter coming from inside his nominal owner&#039;s cottage, he decided she didn&#039;t really need to learn about his failure just yet.</p><p class="double">(It was surprisingly hard to make ponies turn their music down when the music made the ground act like a springy trampoline.)</p><p class="double">Maybe the manticore would be up for a thumb-wrestle...</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.1 continued</p><p class="double">“Are you sure you&#039;ll be okay with this, Gilda?” Twilight asked quietly. “I&#039;m sure none of us would blame you if you took a raincheck for the next few loops and worked with Dash to build something useful.”</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged, full of bravado – which both knew at least partly feigned. “I got this.”</p><p class="double">“Sure?” Twilight double-checked.</p><p class="double">“Sure.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, then.” Twilight nodded. “But, you know, introduce yourself to Dash first, we&#039;ve got a good few hours before the Summer Sun celebrations start.”</p><p class="double">“Good idea.” Gilda looked up, eyes flicking across the sky, then took wing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Hey, slowpoke!”</p><p class="double">Dash jerked awake. “Wha-”</p><p class="double">A familiar griffin flew into sight. “Hi, Dash. Bet you didn&#039;t expect to see me around here!”</p><p class="double">“Gilda!” Dash&#039;s face lit up. “Celestia&#039;s muzzle, I haven&#039;t seen you in... must be <i>years</i>. How are you doing?”</p><p class="double">“Eh, you know me.” Gilda flared her wings, and landed on Dash&#039;s cloud. “Snorting fire at every pony who pisses me off, mostly. What about you?”</p><p class="double">Dash grinned. “I&#039;m in charge of the weather around here.”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Gilda looked around, contemplatively. “That explains all the clouds.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, I could clear those in ten seconds flat!” Dash protested. “It&#039;s totally a legit use of time to rest up. Fliers need their rest!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure.” Gilda flicked her tail. “Hey, watch this. Some pony taught it to me a while back.”</p><p class="double">She flicked her tail again, and a cloud fell in half.</p><p class="double">“Cool, huh?”</p><p class="double">“What the...” Dash blinked, and focused. No matter whether she was looping or not, the blue pegasus was an expert at practical applications of weather magic. “Was that... some kind of air blade?”</p><p class="double">“Basically,” Gilda agreed easily. “Anyway, enough about me. So, who else is awesome around here?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“...the night will last forever!”</p><p class="double">Gilda raised a clawed foot. “Point of order.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Nightmare Moon turned to face her.</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Well, I&#039;m basically wondering... if it&#039;s eternal night here, what does that mean for the griffins?”</p><p class="double">“...I do not follow, subject,” the dark alicorn said.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m a free citizen of the Gryphon Lands, thank-you-very-much,” Gilda corrected. “Anyway, the griffins are, what, well into the twilight zone. So, if you&#039;re going to just have a bit of libration going on, then we&#039;ll be perfectly happy with that. Just a suggestion.”</p><p class="double">“What is libration?” Nightmare Moon asked, puzzled.</p><p class="double">Gilda waved her feet in the air. “Basically, it&#039;s when a world sort of... wobbles, I think? Kind of like a drunk bloke heading back to his house. He always faces towards it, but sometimes he&#039;s looking nearly straight at it and sometimes he&#039;s nearly staring into a shop only two doors down from where he&#039;s walking. So, for us, it&#039;d mean the sun goes up, and then goes down again on the same side. Nice and regular.”</p><p class="double">“...I may choose to ignore that,” the Nightmare said, with a flip of her wings. “What concern are the Gryphon Lands to me?”</p><p class="double">“We-ll,” Gilda said, cricking her neck and taking a deep breath, “I couldn&#039;t possibly comment.”</p><p class="double">Her tail lashed for a moment, then described a lazy arc behind her.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon winced, and the moon wobbled a bit. “What did you just do?”</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged, her tail swirling again. “Nothing.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn looked closer, still frowning as she held her moon steady. “Why has your coat gone white?”</p><p class="double">Then her eyes flashed with dark lightning. “Lap-cat of Celestia!”</p><p class="double">Gilda grinned. “Oh, hey, a challenge. Official and everything.”</p><p class="double">As a magical glow built on Nightmare Moon&#039;s horn, Gilda whipped her tail across in a flat arc. Something seemed to linger behind the path it took-</p><p class="double">-and, with the sound of clashing metal, Nightmare Moon&#039;s horn glow vanished.</p><p class="double">“What?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s called a power slash,” the griffin informed her opponent. “Hey, watch!”</p><p class="double">The little tuft of fur at the end of her tail flickered in four distinct arcs, and the stage fell in under Nightmare Moon in a neat square.</p><p class="double">Startled, the returned goddess fell into the basement in a cascade of splinters.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Gilda shouted into the hole, conscious of the awed gazes of about half of Ponyville. “Do you surrender yet?”</p><p class="double">She danced back from the hole with wings flaring. “Whoa, guess not!”</p><p class="double">With a crash, Nightmare Moon emerged from beneath the floor, horn blazing. “Insolent, insignificant little <i>sparrow!</i>”</p><p class="double">Then all her feathers came off in a cloud of cut pinions.</p><p class="double">Gilda winced at the <i>thud</i>.</p><p class="double">“What about now?”</p><p class="double">A cloud of dark, starry smoke boiled up through the hole.</p><p class="double">One final tail-movement. This time, a five hundred and forty degree spiral arc. As she finished it, Gilda reared up and beat her wings once.</p><p class="double">Sudden, gale-force winds blew down the back wall and carried the cloud with them into a nearby house.</p><p class="double">The cloud hit with an incongruous <i>thud.</i></p><p class="double">As the bamboozled Empress of Darkness coalesced, Gilda strode over and grabbed her helm. “Yoink.”</p><p class="double">Turning to the stunned ponies, she put it carefully on her head. “Hey, this makes me the ruler of the night, now, right? ...wait, hang on, or is that a thing only griffins do?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Laughing and joking, Gilda walked slowly back to Twilight&#039;s house in the gathering dawn, with a dozen or so ponies asking questions of her almost non-stop.</p><p class="double">“Hey, it&#039;s Gryphonic law, I thought she was challenging me to a duel! Well, she kinda was – just, less duel more splat. Or so she thought...” a wink.</p><p class="double">This time, Rarity asked a question.</p><p class="double">“The coat? Heh, bit of a trick I picked up. It&#039;s just when I do the painting thing with my tail, though, not sure all the details. It looks cool, though. Come on, guys, I need my beauty sleep.”</p><p class="double">Reluctantly, the crowd drew back, and Twilight let Gilda in through the door.</p><p class="double">The griffin didn&#039;t look back until the door was closed.</p><p class="double">“Are the curtains shut?” she asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Gilda flopped onto a couch.</p><p class="double">“...bucking <i>haybale</i>, I must be crazy...” she said, in a distant tone. “I just fought an honour duel with an alicorn princess...”</p><p class="double">Sweat was running down her face, and her forelegs were trembling as reaction set in.</p><p class="double">“I did just do that, right?” she checked. “It wasn&#039;t just some crazy dream?”</p><p class="double">“No, it was pre-tty cool,” Twilight confirmed. “I didn&#039;t realize you got the Brush powers working, that was great!”</p><p class="double">“Cool. Hey, can I get a flannel?”</p><p class="double">Twilight pulled one down from her bathroom and wetted it. “Here.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.” Gilda rubbed her eyes, then her beak. “Ah, I needed that.”</p><p class="double">There was a silence.</p><p class="double">“...you know, it wasn&#039;t all bravado,” the griffin said in a quiet voice.</p><p class="double">“Oh?”</p><p class="double">“All that posturing. Pretending I didn&#039;t have a care in the world.” Gilda shrugged. “Partly it was – Dash and I are like that – but not all of it. I was...” Gilda&#039;s voice husked for a moment. “Terrified. I had a plan, but...”</p><p class="double">She rubbed the flannel over her face again.</p><p class="double">“Right. Basically, I had to keep her off balance. I&#039;m not bad, I like to think, but I couldn&#039;t beat an alicorn princess in an actual fight.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded along.</p><p class="double">“So, I relied on the brush stuff being too... different, really, for her to understand.”</p><p class="double">“I know what you mean,” Twilight assured her. “I&#039;ve used it a lot. The trick is to not let the enemy refocus – make sure they&#039;re trying to work out what your terms even are, not let them realize they could ignore them.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” Gilda took a deep breath. “Phew. Okay, I&#039;m hungry. Any ideas?”</p><p class="double">“I think I can do an omlette,” Twilight said, already flipping through files on a PADD. “I learned because it&#039;s just polite to give human visitors... well, recognizable food...”</p><p class="double">She paused. “Oh, just so you know, we generally consider it impolite to seriously damage town property unless necessary. But, then, we actually wreck the place once every six <i>months</i> on average, so no harm done. Just something to remember.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Gilda nodded. “I can try – well, that or work on Rejuvenation. Anything else?”</p><p class="double">“Learn a defensive technique. Seriously, you&#039;re going to <i>need</i> one if you keep going up against alicorns...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.4</p><p class="double">“So, how is this... gonna work?” Applebloom asked, prodding her new necklace.</p><p class="double"><i>Hay if I know.</i> Cookie sent a mental version of a shrug. <i>Last we remember was basically dying of old age, and then here we were. Don&#039;t ask us...</i></p><p class="double">“Right.” Applebloom looked up at Twilight. “Are they gonna start Looping?”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. “I doubt it – not on their own, anyway. I mean, they don&#039;t have anypony to be in a normal loop...”</p><p class="double"><i>Loops?</i> Cookie&#039;s mental tone sharpened with interest. <i>What are &#039;loops&#039;?</i></p><p class="double">Earth pony filly and sometimes-alicorn librarian mare exchanged a look.</p><p class="double">“&#039;Bloom, can you go get your friends and their, er... new... friends? I think it&#039;d be easier to explain all this just once.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“...so, anyway,” Twilight finished, clicking her slide projector past the end of the carousel, “that&#039;s the jist of it.”</p><p class="double">The Crusaders snored.</p><p class="double">“It wasn&#039;t <i>that</i> boring,” she said, sounding slightly hurt.</p><p class="double"><i>No, it wasn&#039;t,</i> Cover broadcast. <i>But I think they&#039;ve heard it all before...</i></p><p class="double"><i>What does this mean for us?</i> Pansy asked, getting right to the heart of the matter.</p><p class="double">“I honestly don&#039;t know.” Twilight frowned. “My daughter&#039;s about the only being I know of who loops despite not having existed during the core loop – for her it&#039;s kind of a loophole, because she&#039;s an actualized alter ego... anyway. From what I know of the matter, you might just... stop existing once the Loop ends.”</p><p class="double">The three disembodied founders conversed amongst themselves for quite some time.</p><p class="double"><i>You are sure that a looper must inhabit their own body?</i> Cookie said, carefully.</p><p class="double">“Well... we&#039;ve never known it to happen otherwise, except in particularly strange fused loops...” Twilight rubbed her chin. “Sometimes we turn up as other kinds of body, or even in one another&#039;s bodies, but then we&#039;re established as loopers...”</p><p class="double"><i>And no non-looper may </i>share the body of a looper? continued the earth pony, methodically working down a mental list.</p><p class="double">“Aha!” Twilight&#039;s eyes lit. “I may have something!” She cleared her throat, and held out her hoof. “OWL?”</p><p class="double">A bracelet appeared around her lower leg.</p><p class="double">Stand by, ready.</p><p class="double">“This is Owl, I picked him up in a Nanoha Loop. He&#039;s an Intelligent Device, technically bonded to what may be my soul – I&#039;ve lost the bracelet to a Loop two or three times, before, and it&#039;s always been the same Owl once I reconstructed another one.”</p><p class="double"><i>Ah. Yes, that does have potential.</i></p><p class="double">Cookie paused, and Clover took up the slack. <i>How does one bind an Intelligent Device?</i></p><p class="double">“I can do it fairly easy, providing both halves of the bond are willing and I have the devices...” Twilight said, thinking. “I did it for Trixie and her Device, Loki, and that seems to have stuck. Yes, I should be able to.”</p><p class="double"><i>Good,</i> Pansy commented. <i>Now, er... how long until they wake up?</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and after we managed to find away around the spider eggs, we stuck the key in the chest... and it turned out to be the wrong key! Daring basically just threw up her hooves and dragged the entire chest out of the ruins all the way to Fillydelphia.&quot; Trixie grinned, leaning forward. &quot;Guess what was inside.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis tapped her chin. &quot;I&#039;m thinking.... another riddle map?</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep! Another riddle map!&quot; The unicorn laughed as she leaned back in her chair. &quot;All that for another bucking riddle map, but that&#039;s not the best part. The temple that riddle map led to had been excavated and thoroughly plundered DECADES ago!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh <i>no,</i>&quot; Chrysalis gasped dramatically, her eyes wide as she brought her hooves to her mouth. &quot;Dealing with bureaucracy?! That had to be terrible for her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, yeah. She was lucky I was around.&quot; Trixie sighed. &quot;That was... a completely crazy loop. And that was before Discord got involved.&quot; She let her eyes drift across the plates of hay fries to the black pegasus sitting across from her. &quot;What about you? What&#039;s your craziest Loop story?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rubbed the back of her head. &quot;Well... I&#039;m still fairly new as a looper, and most of my loops tend to start baseline. I mean, I don&#039;t invade Canterlot, I usually go straight to Celestia and negotiate an integration, but aside from minor differences in how ponies view changelings it&#039;s all mostly routine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on, you&#039;ve got to have something!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...there was this one loop where Celestia was the only pony. Everyone else was secretly a changeling.&quot; The black pegasus rolled her eyes. &quot;I know it sounds a lot less dramatic then your Daring Do loop, but with all the hives and the subterfuge it was just... wild. Even after I made peace with Celestia....&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Honestly, Twilight had to keep a chart on her at all times to keep track.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle was actually confused?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow, that... wow.&quot; Trixie shook her head. &quot;That had to have been stressful. Still, all changelings, huh? Shape Twist must have been popular!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blushed a bit. &quot;You... know about that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My special talent is stage magic. Illusions aren&#039;t <i>quite</i> the same as shapeshifting, but...&quot; Trixie shrugs. &quot;I think I&#039;d be fairly good at it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not, actually. I can do ears and tail, but... Biology is hard.&quot; Chrysalis shrugged. &quot;Well, nonmagical biology. The more magical a creature is, the easier it is for me to pulse into it. Unless it&#039;s unstable magic. It&#039;s really all rather complex.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie tapped her chin thoughtfully. &quot;Well... what if you pumped the aura of an ordinary animal with magic? That would make it easier to read, at least...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...That could work,&quot; Chrysalis mused. &quot;I mean... I don&#039;t know what would happen, but... yeah, that&#039;s an idea. I&#039;ll run it by Fluttershy when we have our next practice session.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy the werewolf... Werepone? Ponewolf? I mean, it kind of makes sense, but it&#039;s so unexpected.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apparently it&#039;s a fused loop thing.... I still haven&#039;t had one of those. Mostly just variant loops.”</p><p class="double">Trixie chuckled and shook her head. &quot;Trust me, it can get weird. Twilight&#039;s mentioned this one loop where she was a pet and a secret agent at the same time-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem.&quot; The waiter walked up. &quot;I am afraid, madams, that the restaurant is closing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie glanced at the clock. &quot;Wow, is it that late already? Huh. Well, um... this was fun, actually. I wouldn&#039;t mind doing it again... same time next week?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis smiled. &quot;Sure. Why not.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.6 (Nikas)</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked from the talking ferret to the jewel turned staff he gave her, to the surprised looking Cutie Mark Crusaders.</p><p class="double">The first was only... <i>mildly</i> strange; he did come out of the Everfree, after all. The second was a bit more head turning, but only because of a magical artifact responding to an Earth Pony. The third was jaw dropping, because the surprise was not &quot;What the Buck is That?&quot; The looks of the CMC were more along the lines of &quot;Why the Buck is that Here?&quot;</p><p class="double">She sighed. &quot;You girls know what this is.&quot; It was in no way a question. &quot;Something from another Loop I wasn&#039;t in?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom shook her head. &quot;Not us personally. Miss Twilight was in some loops like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Both fillies ignored Scootaloo&#039;s muttered &quot;Be easier to count places she hasn&#039;t been.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her fellow Earth Pony nodded. &quot;Anyway, she made us something along those lines, well the reasons are involved and we have a rampaging magical artifact to capture and seal first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara nodded as the Crusaders produced magical devices – and why the hay did they name them for the Founders, anyway? Was it the three-friends-three-tribes thing? &quot;Right, any pointers?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle piped up. &quot;Well, Equestrian Magic runs on Friendship. Mid Childa Magic runs on <span style="color:pink;">Befriending</span>. At least you have the right coat colour for it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara shook her head wondering why she could hear the capitalization and color of that word. &quot;Right, more stuff to explain later. HEY UGLY, STEP AWAY FROM THE SWEET SHOP!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked in, giving Macintosh a weary look. &quot;Thanks for setting up the bar early this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a problem.&quot; The stallion slid her a mug. &quot;Let me guess: something about yer last loop got under yer skin?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Twilight had never been one to quaff back cider; even now, it was just a small gulp. &quot;Strange thing is, I didn&#039;t pick up on it. Thought it was a normal lonely loop. I went the route of, well, basically being Pinkie Pie the Nerd. It&#039;s a lonely loop thing.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Nothing seemed off at all, and then the wedding rolled around.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed. &quot;Did Cadance turn out ta have been a changeling all along again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no. No, Cadance was still in the caves.&quot; Twilight laughed wryly. &quot;Thing is, she got replaced before Shining even started dating her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; The unicorn took a sip of her cider. &quot;Poor ol&#039; Cadance, trapped in there almost a year, while Chrysalis fell in love with my brother. Neither of them were awake, so that&#039;s something, but when I brought her to the wedding she was completely shocked. Apparently she only thought of Shining as a brother.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... Shining can&#039;t have taken that well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh it gets better.&quot; Twilight finished off her cider. &quot;Cadance took the opportunity to propose to her real true love... who, it turns out, was me! I mean, that came completely out of nowhere! And, somehow, she&#039;d gotten it in her head that alicorns were above good and evil. Actually, all of Canterlot thought that alicorns could do whatever they wanted, and Chrysalis managed to get them to forgive her for invading – forgive her for INVADING! Just because she claimed to be a cursed alicorn.&quot; The unicorn shook her head with a sigh. &quot;I mean that&#039;s true in some loops, but not that one...&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh chuckled to himself as he refilled the mug. &quot;Begging yer pardon, Twi, but most o&#039; Canterlot lack brains in certain ways.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha. You have no idea.... apparently, Celestia had spent so much on the wedding that the nobles insisted SOMEBODY get married. Me and Shining kept trying to pass the buck to each other for a day or two before I just went alicorn myself and got you and Cheerilee on the pulpit.&quot; She paused. &quot;Um, no offence...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not awake, not me.&quot; The stallion nodded amicably. &quot;Ah&#039;m assumin&#039; ya checked first. Did things cool down after that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh I wish.&quot; Twilight sipped her cider. &quot;Chrysalis and Cadance kept trying to seduce Shining and me... they started giving each other tips...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.6 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... Apple Bloom? You&#039;re talking to Smart Cookie again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... really really really don&#039;t want to sound rude here, but from what I know of Intelligent Devices....&quot; Diamond Tiara searched for the right words. &quot;She&#039;s not really, you know, autonomous, right? She&#039;s a computer, not...&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom stared at her for a while. Suddenly she sighed. &quot;Riiiiight, ya&#039;ll weren&#039;t Awake fer that first Nightmare Night loop. Um, how do Ah put this... this <i>is</i> Smart Cookie. The founder.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See, Cubic Zirconia there, she was made as an Intelligent Device, but...&quot; The farmer filly rubbed the back of her head. &quot;Well... see, there was this one loop where we decided ta dress up as the Founders fer Nightmare Night... but, um, because of magic we actually became the founders. And then, because of magic, the founders kind of stayed around after the costume thing was finished, only they were necklaces... We weren&#039;t sure if they&#039;d start looping...&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara shook her head in disbelief. &quot;That has got to be the third weirdest loop I&#039;ve heard of. Okay, so you guys have... actual people there, fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom narrowed her eyes. &quot;It&#039;s probably wise ta treat <i>all</i> A.I.s as people, least when yer first meeting them. Ah mean, it&#039;s really fifty fifty, and being polite makes it less likely they&#039;ll try ta overthrow &#039;organic masters&#039; and really just go for equality.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, alright... Um... Zirconia, do you think of yourself as a person?&quot;</p><p class="double">The staff in Diamond Tiara&#039;s hooves beeped and flashed for a bit.</p><p class="double">&quot;That <i>so</i> doesn&#039;t clear things up at all.&quot; Smart Cookie and Cubic Zirconia flashed erratically for a few seconds. Diamond Tiara rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, yeah, laugh it up...&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, she turned to Apple Bloom. &quot;So, uh... what were you two talking about anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">To her surprise, the yellow filly glanced away quietly. &quot;Ah&#039;d really rather not say.&quot; Smart Cookie beeped. &quot;No, it&#039;s... it&#039;s personal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apple Bloom....&quot;</p><p class="double">An aggravated, resigned sigh escaped Apple Bloom&#039;s lips. &quot;We were talking bout her family, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Alright...?&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them sat there for a while.</p><p class="double">&quot;...It&#039;s not bad fer her,&quot; Apple Bloom explained eventually. &quot;She was literally pulled from her deathbed to the... to our time, before we made her a device, she had all her affairs in order. It&#039;s just...&quot; She sighed, shaking her head. &quot;How many loops have Ah gone like this? The Apple family, well, we pride ourselves on family. And here Ah am, stuck right at the cusp of puberty. Sometimes Ah&#039;m older.... sometimes Ah&#039;m a LOT older, like Ah&#039;m where Granny Smith would be, normally. And those loop memories give me husbands and children and Ah know, right when the loop resets, there Ah am again being a blank flanked filly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Maybe you&#039;ll have kids someday,&quot; Diamond Tiara offered. &quot;I mean, Nyx--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Loophole. She already existed, just... not like that. The loops consider Nyx and Nightmare Moon ta be the same pony...&quot; Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Best Ah can really hope for is living vicariously through Cookie&#039;s past.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh... that... that sucks.&quot; Diamond Tiara shook her head. &quot;Wow. I never even thought of that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s why we can&#039;t have kids in th&#039; loops,&quot; Apple Bloom explained. &quot;They might not loop and.... well, whoever&#039;s running this thing isn&#039;t that cruel.&quot; She stood. &quot;Anyway, Ah&#039;m feeling pissy. Wanna go find some monsters ta befriend?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey mom, Luna&#039;s not Awake this loop so I thought I&#039;d just drop by to...&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx trailed off as her eyes landed on the unicorn who was... sitting at the kitchen table, a steaming teacup in front of her, staring out the window.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Mom? You okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle took a breath... and slowly let it out. &quot;Hmmm. Well... I&#039;m just a little melancholy.&quot;</p><p class="double">The black alicorn trotted up to the table, sitting in the chair next to her. &quot;Want to talk about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...no.&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;But it&#039;ll probably help... last loop, I Awakened in my childhood. See, I wanted to see if I could get a different cutie mark, something other then magic as a special talent. I had to bribe Dash not to do a rainboom... Lived in Canterlot for a while. A long while...&quot;</p><p class="double">She sipped her tea.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing was working, so I figured; why not make a crusader group all my own? I had my two blank flank friends, we had an adventure....&quot; A small giggle escaped her lips. &quot;Turns out Friendship is Magic. I got the same mark I always get...&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx tilted her head. &quot;So... you&#039;re upset you got the same mark?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. I <i>was</i> upset, but Fleur and Flash... they didn&#039;t understand why. They just kept pestering and asking until finally... I... I told them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her daughter took in a sharp breath. &quot;Oh... oh, I... I&#039;m sorry-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, if you&#039;re awake the loop&#039;s end is really beautiful. Terrible, but beautiful.&quot; Twilight nodded to herself. &quot;They were so afraid... I invited them over for one last tea party. They&#039;d never told anyone else, of course. I... I lied to them, told them they were loopers, that they might be Awake next time....&quot; She sighed. &quot;This morning I arranged to &#039;meet&#039; Fancypants, over a little matter at Celestia&#039;s school. Fleur.... she didn&#039;t recognize me. I don&#039;t know where Flash Sentry is now, but... he promised to send me a letter if...&quot;</p><p class="double">Without even a second thought, Nyx nuzzled her mother. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.9 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;The night shall last forever!&quot; the statement was followed by maniacal laughter on the stage. It was another weird loop, Twilight thought. Instead of Nightmare Moon, it was Tirek that came back from being banished by the two pony princesses.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, is it my turn to handle this?&quot; Fluttershy asked.</p><p class="double">Her purple unicorn friend nodded, &quot;Sure, it&#039;s all yours. Have fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus nodded from under her mane, &quot;Alright. I&#039;ve got to go, um, train.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she flew off, Twilight thought she had detected a hint of a mischievous smile on the reserved animal caretaker, druid, and fellow looper.</p><p class="double">Instead of doing anything herself, she just stood off to the side with the remaining elements of harmony as the evil centaur gloated and monologued about his plans.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, two green vines burst from one of the walls. They sped along the stage, passing Tirek on either side, before leaving through the far wall.</p><p class="double">&quot;What manner of trickery is this?&quot; the villain looked down carefully at the new plants.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the vines, &quot;Those almost look like..&quot;</p><p class="double">That was when a smiling locomotive-riding Fluttershy crashed through the wall at full speed and hit Tirek with the Ponyville Express.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tracks,&quot; Twilight finished in a deadpan.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie looked up with a smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;I get it now! She had to go &#039;Train&#039;!&quot; the pink pony started giggling until she fell down on the floor from laughter.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy landed next to a twitching hoof sticking out of a pile of rubble.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now no more talk about bringing eternal night or ruling the world, mister!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is only a minor setback! I will... what is that?&quot; the voice from inside the rubble pile sounded confused, &quot;Wait, no wait! They&#039;re everywhere!&quot;</p><p class="double">Vines had started to enter into the small cracks in the pile of debris. A lot of vines.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now what was that about giving up on your evil plans?&quot; Fluttershy asked patiently.</p><p class="double">Tirek growled with signs of struggle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t make me send in the squirrels,&quot; the yellow pegasus said, adding, &quot;and I know a lot of squirrels.&quot;</p><p class="double">The struggling stopped, &quot;... I&#039;ll behave.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s better,&quot; Fluttershy smiled.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, why a train, of all things?&quot; asked Rarity.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy just gave a shy smile. &quot;I like trains.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.10</p><p class="double">Twilight knocked on her assistant&#039;s door.</p><p class="double">“Come in,” Spike called, and she pushed it open.</p><p class="double">Inside was... well, a mess. Notes, sketches, designs and even a few mathematical formulae covered the desk, the bed, three walls, and... yes, there were a few clipped to the ceiling as well.</p><p class="double">“You look busy,” Twilight said lightly.</p><p class="double">“I <i>am</i>,” Spike replied. “Hey, is Cadance awake this Loop?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Twilight shook her head. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Wedding planning.” Spike moved a few sketches and sat down.</p><p class="double">“Ouch.” Twilight winced.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Spike shrugged helplessly. “I want it to be the best I can make it... she deserves it. But... well, we&#039;ve seen things which would make the most jaded pony just stand and stare. How can I measure up to that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought for a good long while.</p><p class="double">“I admit, I&#039;m not all that good at this,” she said, slowly, “but it seems to me you have two options.”</p><p class="double">“Two&#039;s better than none,” Spike said, clapping his hands. “Let&#039;s hear them.”</p><p class="double">“Okay. Option one is that you two go and have a private wedding.” Twilight smiled gently. “I may not be good at this kind of thing, but I&#039;ve seen the two of you together – she wouldn&#039;t <i>care</i> if you got married in an epic cathedron or a... a hedge, really.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded.</p><p class="double">“The other option is to ask for help. From <i>all </i>of us, not just Cadence and I. If you&#039;re planning to wait until we&#039;re all here at the same time, then do – I&#039;ll let the others know you&#039;re after help when I see them.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Spike nodded again, and frowned. “I... don&#039;t know,” he confessed. “Part of me wants to show the world how lovely Rarity is... I&#039;m just not sure, Twi. Sorry.”</p><p class="double">Twilight bowed her head. “You don&#039;t need to make a decision now. Think it over.”</p><p class="double">“I will,” he promised.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Spike, there&#039;s no reason you can&#039;t do both.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought of that but... I don&#039;t know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It might be for the best, you both get a private intimate exchange of vows – you could be by yourselves or perhaps a few select witnesses. Then you can have a big event that will be the envy of the Looper&#039;s everywhere. Remember we functionally have eternity, myself more so. Anything Rarity and you want for this tell me and I&#039;ll get it.” Twilight grinned at him. “That&#039;s my wedding present to you.”</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s really tempting, but the big – the main reason I don&#039;t know if a big event is a good idea is that I... I don&#039;t want our first years together spoiled by ponies or... or, hay, <i>anyone,</i> complaining that Rarity&#039;s marrying a child. The &#039;Big Circles&#039; in Canterlot all <i>know</i> I&#039;m well under age and by the time I&#039;d be old enough our loop is usually over...&quot; Spike kicked the chair, sounding surprisingly bitter. &quot;I know it&#039;ll happen eventually, but I don&#039;t want it to happen – I want it to <i>not</i> happen for as long as possible, and definitely not at or just after our wedding.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;That, at least, isn&#039;t a problem that&#039;s going to be hard to solve.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not?&quot; Spike asked hopefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh No!&quot; Twilight cried out theatrically, &quot;Twilight&#039;s lost control of an experimental spell and The Elements, Spike and a bunch of others have been sucked into a magical portal! What ever shall we do! The portal has disappeared! Oh wait another portal is appearing! The horror! The HORROR! Yay! They&#039;re all back! Wait do they look older to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">She grinned, &quot;We say we travelled to a bunch of different worlds over fifteen to twenty years or so before managing to come back and that gives us an excuse to use <i>anything</i> you and Rarity want without raising more eyebrows. What do you say?&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Her loop memories trickled in, tip-toeing around her semi-conscious mind.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oi, luv, my rum.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her eyes snapped awake. Bad mistake, hangover plus mid-day sun reflecting off of the sea did not a charitable equation make. &quot;Ooooh. My head.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s what you get for drinking all of my rum. Here, take a bucket.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To-URK- ugh, that in?&quot; Twilight took the bucket, hiding it under her chin as her feet grew oddly wet.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, to bail out the boat it, though I have found it to be most delightfully useful for the first. We&#039;re sinking, and I would rather that we make our entrance to Port Royal in dryness and style. One must have a proper sense of showmanship in this line of work.&quot; The mysterious figure talked to much. Twilight tried to brain of who he was, but her think was broken and she had a case of the dumbs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you again? Everything is all-JACK!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain, Captain Jack Sparrow. Good to see you&#039;re finally awake-awake. Ever since we met, this confoundable loop has kept on- what did your friend call it? Ah, yes, it kept on shipping me with you. My Rum please.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The wha-? I was drinking this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quite fond of it.&quot; Jack took the bottle from her, distractedly pitching it overboard to her confusion. &quot;You drank it all, love. Rum&#039;s gone. Now start bailing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bailing, why-&quot;Twilight stopped talking as a jet of water started hitting her in the face. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">36.2 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&#039;I have paws.&#039;</p><p class="double">After a couple thousand loops, such things usually wouldn&#039;t upset Twilight Sparkle, but then her loop memories hit, and she was a bit weirded out. They were telling her she was a dog named Sparkplug, owned by Luna, who now a wacky inventor. &#039;Was that trip to the moon for real? Is it really made of cheese?&#039; Granted there had been that one loop back then where Luna had deliberately turned the moon into cheese, but it had been rock before. Also, that one had tasted like Brie, while the one here tasted a bit like Wensleydale, but not quite. &#039;When did I get so obsessed with cheese?&#039; Must be a property of the loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>We were running low on cash, so Luna had decided to rent one of spare rooms out. It was late morning when someone applied. Luna went to answer the door, and I remained in my chair where I&#039;d been knitting.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, its about the room, then?</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you like to inspect?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m asking 20 a week, including breakfast.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">Despite only hearing Luna talk, it seemed like there was conversation going. What was even the person she was talking to stepped into view. If I didn&#039;t know this was going to be a weird loop before, this certainly clinched it, as a penguin walked into view. I took a double-take, and the penguin stared at me for a few seconds before walking up to the second floor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>I found myself a half hour later wallpapering our spare room. The penguin had took my room! &#039;Love and tolerance&#039; I told myself. Looking up at the drab ceiling, I could definitely see it needing paint. Instead of getting ladder, I got a brilliant idea. Luna had gifted me, well more like, Luna had gifted herself, with something called Techno Trousers. Basically, mobile, autonomous pants. The neat thing was, they could climb walls and ceilings. It wasn&#039;t long before I&#039;d slipped into them, climbed the walls and hung from the ceiling, painting it. <i>Michaelangelo, eat your heart out.</i></p><p class="double">The clicking and clacking from the pants eventually caused our penguin friend to investigate. It was a bit unnerving, as he just stared at the me and the pants, not saying a word. Granted, I couldn&#039;t talk in this loop myself, but this was a bit unnerving.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>What was even more unnerving, after settling into the newly painted and wallpapered room, was the loud music coming from what was previously my room. Seemed that penguin really liked &quot;Tie A Yellow Ribbon&quot;, and played it constantly on the radio. I looked at the clock, with 12:20AM staring back at me. Love and Tolerance aside, you don&#039;t interrupt a girl&#039;s beauty sleep. I used a bit of PK and flicked off the radio as subtly as I could, dislodging some of the internal mechanism, so it couldn&#039;t be turned on again. The music sputtered and died, leaving a bit of static behind, and then, blessed silence.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>After last night, and the events of the morning; the penguin, I had never gotten its name and he couldn&#039;t talk, had fetched Luna&#039;s slippers and newspaper. Normally, this was something I, or at least Sparkplug did in the past. Was the penguin simply being nice? I took a walk to clear my head.</p><p class="double">As I was walking by the post office, something caught my eye. A wanted poster for a chicken named &#039;Feathers McGraw&#039; and a sizeable bounty underneath it. Something seemed very familiar about the picture. I put my paw over the rooster comb to cover it, revealing that our boarder, the penguin, was actually Feathers McGraw, a notorious criminal. I rushed home.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Thankfully, Feathers was out, though I didn&#039;t know when he&#039;d return. I entered his room, my room, I thought ruefully. Yes, I can be very petty in my thoughts. Looking through his belongings, I found two very suspicious things. A map of the City Museum, and the Diamond Exhibition highlighted and labelled, and a handgun, very highly restricted in the UK. I had all the evidence I needed.</p><p class="double">I waited for Feathers&#039; return.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>I hauled the trussed up penguin into the kitchen where Luna was.</p><p class="double">&quot;What have you done with our paying customer?&quot; I took out the penguins bag and removed from it blueprints of the city museum with the diamond exhibition clearly marked.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right suspicious.&quot; said Luna tapping her chin.</p><p class="double">I produced a gun from his bag, and Luna leapt back in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Those&#039;re illegal!&quot;</p><p class="double">Finally, as my clinching evidence, I produced the wanted poster with Feathers face on it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold on there a second! That&#039;s a chicken, not our penguin!&quot; I smacked my forehead. I searched around in Feathers&#039; belonging until I found a red rubber glove, and slapped it upon his head, turning our penguin into a chicken.</p><p class="double">Luna gasped! &quot;It was in disguise all this time.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Well, we nabbed a notorious criminal, our money problems were solved for the foreseeable future, and the diamond on display at the city museum remained safe. As for the Techno Trousers? Well... maybe Applebloom will like them. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">36.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight relaxed in the waters of the out-door hot-spring. She might not have tried this if she hadn’t already consumed a good portion of the jug of pina colada, but it seemed to be working out. The manager of the onsen was a Mr Urashima, a thirty-something male who moved with authority and the aid of a walking stick. She’d expected some resistance, despite the fact that Japan had never gone to more than level two alert, but after a quick explanation, he’d just shrugged his shoulders and treated her like any other customer. She heard him muttering something about Hinata House and how compared to that, this was nothing, but he’d treated her with the utmost courtesy.</p><p class="double">Twilight had set an Apple Bloom built universal data-pad to download X-Com’s main database before she’d appeared in their main control and distracted them. Having Dr Vahlen’s clearances and not giving her time to change them before Twilight accessed them had meant the entire system had been pretty much an open book. She hadn’t had time to review it fully, but a quick-learn spell had given her the gist, covering the gaps in Dr Vahlen’s knowledge. It was how she’d decided where to go, though Japan would have probably been on her list anyway.</p><p class="double">At the moment she was the only one in the women’s side of the bath, though most of the (female) staff had been cycling through, supposedly checking if she needed anything, but she suspected just to see she was for real. She had no doubt at least one of them had taken some camera phone footage of her in the corridors, but she’d rigged her data-pad to monitor any outgoing data or calls for certain patterns, and set up an area alarm spell covering the resort to identify any approaching soldiers or police.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately though from the many futuristic loops she’d been through she had command of technologies that X-Com would give their collective eye-teeth for, she couldn’t use it openly – as in-loop Equestria was its usual tech level, roughly 1930’s base-line earth with magic buffing it in places and a good dollop of magitek outright blurring the lines. Later on she’d be able to justify some knowledge through local study and genius, but she was still limited. Magic, on the other hand, she could go to town on.</p><p class="double">Still, for the moment she was just relaxing. She’d had half an hour in her room to rest before the bath was empty, but the vegetable sushi they’d delivered had been delicious, and went well with the rest of contents of the jug. There had also been a cotton yakuta, a simpler version of a kimono, on the bed for the use of a guest. While it hadn’t been much use in its base state, a few spells learned from Rarity had adapted it to her body shape, and changed the structural colour of the white cotton to purple, with her cutie mark emblazoned on the flank. As a joke, she even enlarged one of the umbrellas from the pina colada as an accessory.</p><p class="double">Umbrella and yakuta both now lay in a basket in the changing area, along with soap and shampoo, which she’d used extensively with the shower before getting in the bath. The reactions of the staff as she’d emerged had been fun, and asking for toiletries had managed to calm any fears that she would mess up the baths proper. </p><p class="double">She could see why. The bath was an area the size of a small swimming pool, a mostly natural bowl in the hillside surrounded with pumice and screened from the outside by bamboo walls. The whole effect was pleasing, and the warmth and minerals in the water washed away her cares and aches as effectively as any of Aloe and Lotus’s herbal formulas. In fact, she could tell that someone, probably a Shinto priest with at least some degree of talent, had blessed the place once. The spell had decayed, but it was a good effort for someone who’d basically been working by guess.</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed as she renewed the spell and tidied it up, making it self-sustaining off of the natural geo-thaumic energies that the hot spring produced. It was roughly equivalent to taking a dug-out canoe made by someone who had no knowledge of physics beyond what he could see, and using a degree in nautical engineering and all the right craft skills to rebuild it as a speed boat.</p><p class="double">After all, she felt she owed the staff here for how accommodating they’d been, and it should fix the chronic damage she’d detected in the manager’s leg, and the many other old injuries. From the jigsaw puzzle his bones were, it was a wonder he’d survived whatever had caused it.</p><p class="double">She had a plan to obtain some operating capital, while she had tonnes of gold and valuable materials stored in her sub-space pocket, as always she didn’t intend to do anything that broke her in-loop persona. Having that one bag of gold and gems, no more than 20 kilograms as her ‘official’ starting cash would make things slightly more challenging. It would be a definite good deed while also announcing her presence in no uncertain terms, and net her some cash and another couple of hundred kilos of gold.</p><p class="double">More healing spells on hospitals where casualties from alien attacks were still recovering, maybe raising her own small island to grow potions ingredients, repair spells to speed up the rebuilding, donations to aid organisations once she got some revenue producing activities going, and of course some Mysterious Mare-do-Well antics when and where the opportunity presented itself, yes she’d have plenty to keep herself occupied.</p><p class="double">It should go to redeeming the idea that aliens were not necessarily evil, and raising X-Com’s collective blood-pressure, which gave her a warm little glow… No, that was her perimeter alarm triggering. But it wasn’t X-Com or even the JSDF, it was some of the invaders, and they were heading towards the onsen!</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Of course they were little threat to Twilight herself. Calling a match up between a dozen of the invaders and an alicorn of Twilight&#039;s age and power a curb-stomp was like calling the interaction between a snail crawling on a curb and a descending foot a curb-stomp. Technically accurate, but somehow lacking the full measure of the mismatch.</p><p class="double">The question was, why here and now? Narrative causality? Then Twilight realised there was an easier explanation. She&#039;d found the after action report on her capture, and the reaction of the team&#039;s psychic to her uncontrolled magic. Using Doctor Vahlen&#039;s knowledge, she quickly had a pretty good working theory of what was happening. She lifted herself out of the water and dried herself off by creating a telekinetic shield flush to her fur and flicking away every droplet, which arced around to form a fist sized sphere that she dropped back in the pool.</p><p class="double">Now dry, she marched through the changing area to the doors, grabbing her yukata and stepping into it without breaking stride. She was still binding the belt when she opened the door and found the receptionist, Kimiko standing guard. “Twilight-san? Is there something wrong with the baths? The service?”</p><p class="double">“No, not the baths. You&#039;ve all been great!” Twilight smiled up at her, then sombered up. “But I have to see the manager, urgently!”</p><p class="double">As she entered the managers office she decided not to beat around the bush. “There are aliens coming, bad ones! I had an alarm spell out against unexpected visitors, but I didn&#039;t expect any this... er, unexpected. X-Com, that secret defence agency I told you about must have shot them down somewhere near here then lost them.”</p><p class="double">Kimiko gasped, but Urashima frowned. “There was a bright shooting star in the sky several weeks ago. It scared people, but when nothing else happened, people ignored it. Why now? You?”</p><p class="double">“I think so.” Twilight shook her head. “I swear, I had no idea this could happen, but I think my magic interferes with their psionic technology. I must be like a beacon to them. Now I know what&#039;s happening, I can damp it, but that won&#039;t stop them.”</p><p class="double">“What can?” The manager got up and limped over to the window. “There are only half-a-dozen guests, thankfully it&#039;s quiet, but there are twice that many staff. If you leave, will they follow?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but I don&#039;t know where I could lead them that wouldn&#039;t bring someone else into danger. I don&#039;t think you have time to evacuate and they&#039;re coming from the northwest.”</p><p class="double">“And that access road to the highway sweeps round that way... you think they will fire on our cars?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, but I think the safest option is for everyone to stay in the building while I put a force shield around it.”</p><p class="double">“Strong enough to stop these things from getting in?”</p><p class="double">“Strong enough to stop anything short of one of your heavy air-to-ground missiles.” Twilight tapped her horn with a hoof. “This isn&#039;t just for show you know.”</p><p class="double">Actually it would probably soak a tactical nuke, but she didn&#039;t want to give away her full power. Urashima just nodded and picked up his phone handset, punching an internal combination. Seconds later he spoke and Twilight and Kimiko could hear the P.A system relaying his instructions.</p><p class="double">“So, what will you do?” Kimiko asked. “Help keep the shield up until someone comes to rescue us?”</p><p class="double">“No, I have to go out to face them.” Both humans looked at her in shock. “Hopefully X-Com will respond, but they&#039;ll take time getting here. If the aliens can&#039;t get in, who knows where else they&#039;ll go, who else they&#039;ll harm? Besides, X-Com sees me as just another specimen, probably &#039;capture or kill at all costs&#039; after the way I escaped.”</p><p class="double">“But you said you&#039;re a librarian, a researcher, not a soldier!” Kimiko exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“I was also Princess Celestia&#039;s protege, and one of her go-to troubleshooters.” Twilight said, “I&#039;ve been in fights before. And that was before I became an alicorn. Trust me, I can protect you all.”</p><p class="double">Urashima put his hand over the mouthpiece and said, “Well, everyone&#039;s inside.”</p><p class="double">“Good!” Twilight&#039;s horn glowed fiercely, and a purple wash descended past the window. She made another small gem appear which glowed briefly, runes embedding themselves in it in lines of fire. She dropped it in the manager&#039;s hand. “To bring down the shield, press this against it and say the word &#039;release&#039; three times.”</p><p class="double">Her head turned slightly, as if she was looking at something only she could see. “They&#039;re here, I have to go.”</p><p class="double">Kimiko dropped to her knees and put her arms around the alicorn. “Good...”</p><p class="double">Both of them vanished in a flash of white light.</p><p class="double">“... luck?” Kimiko looked around. They were back in the ladies bath area, the surface of the shield rising behind them in a great dome, covering the entire complex of buildings, but not the gardens or baths themselves. Twilight shook herself free.</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and Kimiko was lifted and pushed back through the shield, which rippled and let her through. Meanwhile Twilight stepped out from the walkway onto the water surface closing her eyes and breathing deeply. Zecora&#039;s training came back to her, supplemented by later knowledge from dozens of loops, and the water supported her, stilling to a mirror surface under the ripples from her hooves.</p><p class="double">She had a dozen ways she could take them out, two dozen if she wasn&#039;t worried about damaging the scenery, but now the civilians were as safe as she could make them, she didn&#039;t have to go quick and dirty. Using massive over-power might also scare people. No, this was definitely the place for a more elegant form of combat from a bygone age, a long long time ago, in a galaxy far away. Besides, she needed the practice.</p><p class="double">She could justify it in loop as a lost form of unicorn martial art she&#039;d been recreating as a private project. Of course, she couldn&#039;t explain a light-sabre, but she&#039;d long since come up with a work-around for that. A purple energy blade extended from the tip of her horn with a low hum, then detached to hover in front of her in a guard position.</p><p class="double">Kimiko did what any modern person did when faced with something extraordinary, pulled out her phone and started filming. Three Sectoids, small humanoids, bulb headed and hunched, dropped over the edges of the bamboo screen between the bath and the forest outside, and immediately shot at her with their plasma pistols. The energy blade in front of her moved with almost lazy sweeps, intercepting the bolts and flinging them skywards or into the waters between them.</p><p class="double">Even as the duel started, three Floaters flew over the barrier, a form of barely humanoid cyborg who had a body made up of just a torso with a pair of jet engines built into it&#039;s back. Their plamsa rifles increased the odds to six to one, but Twilight&#039;s energy blade kept deflecting the bolts, slowly moving forward. As a Sectoid got to the water&#039;s edge she deflected a Floater bolt into the water in front of it, blinding it with a burst of steam, and then she moved, wings flapping once to shoot her across in front of it as it reeled back, her horn glowing.</p><p class="double">It was enveloped in purple light, and shrunk down as she overflew it, leaving behind a plant pot with a geranium in, plasma pistol lying beside it. She flipped over in mid-air and rebounded off part of the rockery wall, still deflecting the few energy blasts that were anywhere near target. Her wings swept again, drawing up steam from the hot waters below and flinging it in front of her, engulfing one of the Floaters. The cloud shrunk and condensed to the density of candy floss, darkening at the same time.</p><p class="double">Using its bulk as a screen from the other two she flew towards it and spun to give it a kick with both hind-hooves. Lightning flashed and crackled throughout the cloud, and the Floater dropped out of it to splash into the water below, engines dead and cybernetics shorted out. The cloud was instantly shredded by plasma fire from the other two Floaters, but not before Twilight had popped up from behind it and used it as a springboard to flip through the air over their heads.</p><p class="double">One got transformed into a Floater shaped balloon, while the other was hit by the plasma pistols of both remaining Sectoids as she ducked behind it and they frantically tried to register on her. It exploded, leaving her exposed, but the two aliens had no time to use this as they were grabbed by her telekinetic force and flung together, smacking their heads against each others. Twilight landed and dropped the two in front of her, changing them to a potted lily and a small spiny cactus.</p><p class="double">Twilight brought her energy blade up into guard position again, and gave a great downbeat with her wings shooting up to fly over the bamboo wall. There were flashes and the sounds of plasma fire, and then the bamboo screen was smashed down as Twilight was flung backwards through it, curled up and glowing with a purple aura. She hit the pumice spire that formed the centrepiece of the bath and went straight through it, smashing the spire to splinters. She finally uncurled and flung her wings out, arresting her flight and dropped down to stand on the water again.</p><p class="double">The Muton, a hulking humanoid in sculpted armour that had clearly back-handed her through the wall, raised it&#039;s arms and roared in triumph or to call it&#039;s allies. It found this was unwise when the purple alicorn flashed from where she stood to right in front of him and blasted him with magic. He was instantly transformed into a cherry tree. Unfortunately it didn&#039;t completely block the hole and a trio of Chryssalids, three legged mantis-like aliens with scythe tipped arms skittered through the gap, forcing her to fall back.</p><p class="double">She ran backwards out onto the water and one leapt in after her, splashing it&#039;s way through more slowly than it&#039;s initial rush. Her horn glowed and the water swirled up in a waterspout to engulf it, then froze, leaving it encased in a block of ice. The other two made massive leaps onto the now flattened central rock spire, getting behind her. The remaining rubble shot upwards with a purple glow of telekinesis, battering their undersides and giving her time to turn and face the threat.</p><p class="double">One Chryssalid&#039;s scythe arms swept down to spear her, but her energy blade flew up and extended to the length of a bo staff, horizontal in the air to catch them by the &#039;elbows&#039;. The other leapt again to get behind her, and intercepted a pair of hind hooves glowing with energy on the way down. It was thrown all the way back to crash into the cherry tree where it slumped, leaking ichor. Twilight&#039;s energy blade continued to duel with the twin arm blades of her opponent, finally feinting to make it over-reach itself.</p><p class="double">As the blades speared out to pierce her through and through, she down-winged and jumped flying over then and bringing her energy blade down in a sweep that sliced them off, leaving stubs. The Chryssalid creeled in agony, but was quickly cut short as it was transformed into a spider plant. The ichor leaking one was similarly transformed.</p><p class="double">But before she could take a breath, a series of explosions blasted away a good section of the wall, reducing the bamboo to smouldering splinters . Two more Mutons stood there, flanking a massive bi-pod war machine with a row of four glowing lights on it&#039;s main body like unblinking eyes, a Sectopod. Twilight was once again reduced to deflecting and dodging fire as the two humanoids fired their plasma rifles continuously.</p><p class="double">The frozen Chryssalid was hauled into the air and flung at the Sectopod by Twilight&#039;s telekinesis, but it blasted the block of ice and it&#039;s prisoner into shards and steam. A few seconds later one of the mutons dropped an alien grenade in the water underneath her and she was engulfed as it exploded, creating a huge dome of scalding steam even as the Sectopod fired again sweeping the volume with energy cannon fire that pierced it, and was absorbed by the dome shield.</p><p class="double">Kimiko, who had been recording the fight eagerly, screamed out in shock. “Twilight!”</p><p class="double">The Mutons strode forward as the steam started to disperse, spreading out to either side of the Sectopod and sweeping the area with their plasma rifles. One fired at Kimiko, causing her to shriek and hunch away, but the shield absorbed it without a ripple.</p><p class="double">Suddenly a massive burst of purple light from behind them blasted the other Muton forward into the air, flinging him against the shield to slump down like a rag doll. His plasma rifle was ripped away from him by a familiar purple glow. The other Muton spun on the spot to target Twilight Sparkle, who was standing behind and between the legs of the Sectopod, yukata ripped and smouldering and with her mane askew, but very much alive and very much annoyed.</p><p class="double">His plasma bolt was absorbed in mid-air by an incandescent indigo ball of force that continued on to strike him, throwing him back against the force field and earthing itself into the shield with crackles of purple lightning. He slumped down against it alongside his comrade. The Sectopod was now aware that it&#039;s opponent was right behind it, but had no time to do anything as it was hauled upwards as if on an elastic band, weapons facing upwards.</p><p class="double">Twilight flew up after it, her energy blade forming above her horn and extending to bo staff length. She came up underneath the robot and the indigo line of energy pierced it from back plate to front, right through it&#039;s main control nexus. The row of lights dimmed and died out, and the legs went limp.</p><p class="double">Twilight glided down, letting the wrecked robot land between the two Mutons, and transforming them into palm trees almost as an afterthought. She landed back where she&#039;d originally started standing on the water that stilled under her hooves, and looked around, her energy blade shrinking back into her horn. “Oh my gosh! What a mess!”</p><p class="double">She lowered her head and raised it, and three balls of water floated up from the bath to slowly orbit her. Her horn glowed with energy, golden this time, and the water exploded outwards in a wave that engulfed the entire area with golden energy. As it slid off the shield and Kimiko was able to see out again, she found that all the battle damage had vanished, the bamboo screening was once more intact, the bath clear of debris and the pumice spire was restored. Indeed the entire bath looked pristine, not so much as a leaf floating on the water. Even Twilight was once more in an immaculate yukata with not a hair in her mane or tail out of place. The secretary finally found her voice, though she didn&#039;t stop recording.</p><p class="double">“That was... amazing!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to face her, blushing. “Yes well, customers are expected to leave the baths in the condition they find it. It said so on the sign in the changing rooms.”</p><p class="double">“Not that!” Kimiko giggled. “Though that was awesome too! I mean the zapping and the kapowing and whooshing and the whole martial arts bad-ass Jedi spell-caster thing!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that.” Twilight said dismissively. I said I could take care of myself, didn&#039;t I? I&#039;ve been redeveloping an ancient unicorn martial arts style. It&#039;s a fascinating project, though even I didn&#039;t expect it to be so effective, though that might just be the extra power boost from being an alicorn. Of course I added some new elements to it, like water walking. I learned that from a wise zebra shaman, also precision control of my telekinesis.”</p><p class="double">“So I see. You&#039;re doing it right now.”</p><p class="double">“No I&#039;m... It takes great focus to maintain the increased surface tension...”</p><p class="double">She glanced down. There was the expression of horrified realisation, the frantic little fore-hoof dance, and the classic “Aaaahhhaaa!” Sploosh!</p><p class="double">Kimiko couldn&#039;t help it, she burst out laughing. It didn&#039;t help when a pair of ears emerged above the water and moved towards the edge of the bath like a pair of parallel sharks. One hoof, and then another grappled over the edge of the bath, and hauled up a very bedraggled Twilight, mane matted over her face with her eyes closed. She spit out a stream of water. Kimiko was by this time gasping for air.</p><p class="double">“Oh sure, laugh it up!” A glow formed around Twilight and she lifted herself out onto the walkway. “You recorded that too?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry, but it was very funny.” Kimiko calmed down. “Look, I&#039;ll edit that out. You don&#039;t mind me posting the rest to some sites I know?”</p><p class="double">Twilight repeated her instant drying spell and was once more neat and dry. “It&#039;s okay, leave it in. My ego&#039;s not so fragile that I can&#039;t take a joke at my expense. Besides, I want people to know I&#039;m not like those things. Humans are afraid of aliens, and from this lot, rightly so, but my friend Pinkie Pie taught me long ago that it&#039;s hard to be scared of something when you&#039;re laughing at it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped through the shield like it was open air. “Let&#039;s go tell Mr Urashima that the trouble is over.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, the way you killed those aliens...”</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t kill anyone!” Twilight huffed. “Well, I guess you could call destroying those golems, no robots, killing, but the ones I turned into potted plants are still alive. I could even turn them back, though I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be doing them any favours, as X-Com would probably just kill them for real. I first did it by accident on my entrance exam to Princess Celestia&#039;s School for Gifted Unicorns. Turned both my parents into plants. Thankfully they turned back soon afterwards.”</p><p class="double">Kimiko shivered. “They won&#039;t turn back by themselves, will they?”</p><p class="double">“Not with this version of the spell. Only I can reverse it, otherwise it&#039;s permanent.”</p><p class="double">“Well it was really impressive. You probably couldn’t hear me but I was cheering &#039;banzai&#039; the whole time.”</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “Shouldn&#039;t that be bonsai?”</p><p class="double">Kimiko groaned as they reached the manager&#039;s office. Keitaro called out for them to come in at the knock and slumped back in his seat when he saw it was the two of them. “Thank the kami, you&#039;re both safe! The aliens, they have been dealt with?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight took them all out, it was so cool!” Kimiko replied, and held up the camera. “I even have video! She even cleaned up afterwards!”</p><p class="double">Twilight added. “Not quite. There are a bunch of potted plants and some broken robots lying on the walkway outside the women&#039;s wash area. But don&#039;t worry, when X-Com get here they&#039;ll take them all away. Oh, that reminds me could I get a copy of that film?”</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t know you had a laptop?” Kimiko said, puzzled.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t need one. Just hold that phone against my horn.” She did as she was asked, and silvery threads slid down the grooves inn her horn as it glowed. “I originally developed this spell for reading books fast, pretty much any kind of paperwork where you didn&#039;t want to actually have to go through it. Based on a spell to share memories. Turns out it works just as well on other forms of stored information.”</p><p class="double">She took her horn away and pointed it away from them. A glow appeared at the tip, and a window formed in the air, showing a few seconds from the fight. “Got it!”</p><p class="double">Seh turned to see the two humans were gob-smacked. “What? I raise an energy shield over the entire place and this is what impresses you? Kimiko, I think you&#039;d better get that stuff uploaded as widely as possible, and as soon as possible, before X-Com take that too.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, of course!” Kimiko practically flew out of the room.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to the Keitaro. “I&#039;ve had enough of a bath for one night. Could I use my room until X-Com get here? I really don&#039;t want to stick around after that.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, Twilight-dono.” Keitaro bowed his head. “And thank you, for saving all of us.”</p><p class="double">“No need for that formal stuff, it was my fault you were in harms way in the first place.” The bag of gold appeared and she placed a stack of coins and a couple of small gems, maybe a half kilo worth on his desk. “I&#039;d better settle up while I&#039;m here, that should cover it.”</p><p class="double">The manager reached out and pushed it back. “I can&#039;t accept this. I meant what I said.”</p><p class="double">&quot;So did I.&quot; Twilight pushed it back. &quot;I need to pay my way, and show I have. Otherwise X-Com, or some other bunch that&#039;s scared of me, will claim I mind controlled you all, or something. Oh, and I&#039;d suggest you take a long bath yourself. I have a feeling it will be good for your leg, for all of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Keeitaro&#039;s eyes narrowed in thought. &quot;You did something to the baths?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well someone did, a long time ago. I may have... improved their work slightly. Healing spells aren&#039;t my speciality, but I am widely read in all fields of magic. I made it relatively slow acting, you need to bathe several times to get the full benefit.&quot; She looked around conspiratorially. &quot;Don&#039;t tell anyone, some idiot will probably get all freaked out about it. Just let the results speak for themselves.&quot;</p><p class="double">Keitaro finally accepted some gold, but only enough to cover the regular cost of a stay and the yukata she&#039;d modified. “If you want to do something more, make sure you say good-bye to Kimiko before you go. She seems to have taken a shine to you.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, if you&#039;re sure...” Twilight yawned and put a hoof to her face. “Oh my, I guess that fight took more out of me than I thought. I&#039;ll get off to my room. Goodnight, and if I don&#039;t get chance to see you again, farewell.”</p><p class="double">As she went up to her room, Twilight reflected on how well things had gone. She hadn&#039;t intended to be filmed, but when she realised she had she did do things slightly more flamboyantly then she might otherwise have. Still, the bit at the end had been pure serendipity, her concentration failing at just the right moment for maximum comic impact. That would do more to cement her reputation as non-hostile than a hundred heartfelt speeches.</p><p class="double">She stripped off her yukata and climbed up into the big, human sized bed and snuggled down under the covers. She had just enough energy left to reset her alarm spell before she drifted off to sleep. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>36.4</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped up to the hill overlooking Sweet Apple Acres. “So... I understand that these need to be picked, then?”</p><p class="double">Mac nodded. “Yup.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around. “There&#039;s a lot of them.”</p><p class="double">The stallion positively exuded agreement.</p><p class="double">“Okay. I think I can do this.”</p><p class="double">“Why you?” Mac said, turning to her and wincing. “Ah know why ah ain&#039;t doin&#039; it, but...”</p><p class="double">“Oh. I lost a bet with Applejack.” Twilight looked Mac over. “Are you all right? I heard you strained something...”</p><p class="double">“Ah&#039;ll be fine.” Mac grimaced. “Ah ain&#039;t goin&#039; t&#039; the doctor, anyways. Not after-”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough,” Twilight said. “I remember Spike shouting about his eyes burning?”</p><p class="double">Mac blushed. “Neither of us is much good at winnin&#039; bets with mah sister, ah&#039;d guess.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Okay... here we go.”</p><p class="double">The whole forest began to glow purple.</p><p class="double">Whistling something, Twilight corralled the thousands of apples into distinct streams and began decanting them into barrels. Each barrel was carefully packed in a cubic-crystal efficient packing arrangement, then sealed and stacked in the convenient nearby barn.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s done,” she said, five minutes later. “I fancy a coffee. Want me to get you something?”</p><p class="double">Mac thought for a moment about what he&#039;d seen, and quickly came to a conclusion.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d prefer tea, thank you.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, Fluttershy?” Raindrops asked. “Not seen you up here in a while. We thought you were afraid of flying...”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, and shuffled back to the centre of the cloud she was on.</p><p class="double">“Oh! Sorry. But, er... why?”</p><p class="double">“Bet with Dash,” Fluttershy whispered, then kicked the cloud uncertainly.</p><p class="double">It summarily failed to pop.</p><p class="double">“Er... how does this work again?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack whistled.</p><p class="double">Winona nodded to a covey of birds, which took off and headed over to the latest hoof-ful of grain the farmpony had set out.</p><p class="double">One of the geese tried to move forward out of turn, and Winona growled briefly.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Applejack said eventually. “Now it&#039;s y&#039;all turn, Angel.”</p><p class="double">The bunny gave her a dismissive look.</p><p class="double">“Well, y&#039; eat what ah give you, or y&#039; don&#039;t eat today.” Applejack got out a carrot. “Ah shoulda never made that bet with Fluttershy, ah can tell you...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Look,” Dash said wearily. “I can&#039;t do dressmaking, so this is basically the only option I had left.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo made a bizarre sound as she tried to hold in gales of laughter.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah...” the speedster muttered, shifting slightly in the huge, frilly white dress she was... <i>ensconced</i> in. “Take it from me, squirt. Only make a bet when you&#039;re sure you&#039;ll win it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...and that is how to make a cake with style!” Rarity finished. “With flair, with grace, with panache!”</p><p class="double">Carrot Cake examined it. “Is there... anything under the cream?”</p><p class="double">“Well, no...” Rarity admitted. “Is that a problem?”</p><p class="double">By way of demonstration, Carrot Cake took up a cake slicer and tried to cut a slice.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Rarity said, as the entire Rarity&#039;s Stylish Cream Puff Cake stuck to the slicer. “This is a lot harder than Pinkie makes it look...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess sunbutt!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Pinkie here!

I know he wanted the Crystal Heart, but what he was going to <i>do</i> with it? No idea.” Spike shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Well, I know what to do next time,” Twilight said. “Hmmm...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight?” Celestia said, pushing open the door to the library. “Are you there?”</p><p class="double">No response.</p><p class="double">“How strange.”</p><p class="double">Celestia thought hard. Her messages via Spike had only received terse replies about some &#039;experiment&#039;, so she had come to check on her student in person, in advance of giving her the first &#039;solo&#039; mission she would have.</p><p class="double">Her eyes alighted on a note resting on the table.</p><p class="double">“Dear Princess,” she read. “I have recently discovered that the Crystal Empire has returned. I have made haste to their capital, in order to assess the situation.”</p><p class="double">Celestia frowned, then her eyes widened. “She doesn&#039;t know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“So, King Sombra, we deliver unto you the Crystal Heart,” Twilight finished, putting the large hunk of crystal on the floor.</p><p class="double">Sombra looked at it. “<b>Crystal</b>?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Crystal,” Twilight agreed.</p><p class="double">“Are you sure this is okay?” Spike asked, looking nervous. “He looks evil...”</p><p class="double">“So did Nightmare Moon,” Twilight pointed out.</p><p class="double">“She <i>was</i> evil!” Spike said. “Luna isn&#039;t, but that&#039;s not the same thing...”</p><p class="double">“Sssh, I want to see what happens.” Twilight pointed.</p><p class="double">Sombra arose from his throne, darkness drifting around him, and approached the great relic...</p><p class="double">Then paused.</p><p class="double"><b>“What now?”</b></p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “Oh, you must be joking.”</p><p class="double">Sombra tapped the crystal heart, which went <i>tink.</i> <b>“Crystal? Crys-tal?”</b></p><p class="double">One wall exploded, admitting Celestia. “Twilight! Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“Fine, thanks,” Twilight said, dropping a reflex-quick shimmershield. “I wanted to see if King Sombra could do anything with the Crystal Heart. It turns out... not.”</p><p class="double">Celestia took in the situation. Twilight, fine... Spike, scared but fine... the Crystal Heart, unscathed but dusty... and King Sombra&#039;s horn sticking out of a pile of rubble.</p><p class="double">“I see. Wasn&#039;t that awfully risky?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “I keyed it to a teleport, so I <i>could</i> technically summon it to me if needed. It&#039;s a tricky spell, involves writing a runic form of my name on the object in magic, but useful.”</p><p class="double">Celestia poked the pile of rubble, which mumbled something about crystals.</p><p class="double">“I remember him being more dangerous...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">36.6</p><p class="double">Twilight could just about <i>taste</i> something off about this Loop.</p><p class="double">She wasn&#039;t sure what, she wasn&#039;t sure how, but this loop was NOT standard.</p><p class="double">All that said, though, it certainly <i>looked</i> normal. Twilight and her friends (all six of them Awake) were in Ponyville, as normal. The Summer Sun celebration had proceeded as planned, then not as planned, then as normal for a standard-issue loop.</p><p class="double">(They&#039;d gone with the old standby of Twilight getting the Elements working first try, and all six of them blasting Nightmare Moon&#039;s smoke-form as she tried to kidnap Twilight.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Applejack gathered up her crop for the year (the hard way, relatively speaking, to test out some mental trick or other she&#039;d picked up to help with tiredness), Twilight wondered if she was just imagining things.</p><p class="double">Then she vanished in a puff of smoke.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She materialized, horn flaring and muscles tense with alarm, in a grassy field.</p><p class="double">With a human (boy, but with white hair) looking at her.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">The boy stared for another moment, then jumped into the air. “Awesome! Maybe not as cool as I was hoping, but the chicks will love it!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, what&#039;s going on?” she asked, confused.</p><p class="double">“Oh.” The boy stopped jumping. “I&#039;m Jiraiya. Your new summoner!”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at him for another moment, then facehoofed.</p><p class="double">So much for normal loop... they were replacing the <i>toad summons.</i></p><p class="double">Sighing, Twilight looked up. “Okay, then. My name&#039;s Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">Jiraiya winced. “Yeah, that&#039;s not going to win me any manly points with Orochimaru... but I&#039;m pretty sure Tsunade will love you guys!”</p><p class="double">He sidled up to her. “Women like fuzzy animals, right?”</p><p class="double">Twilight felt like facehoofing again. This was <i>definitely</i> Jiraiya.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Wait,” Pinkie said, raising a hoof. “Does this mean we&#039;re way back in time from when Naruto normally kicks butt and stuff?”</p><p class="double">“It... does, actually,” Twilight confirmed. “Tell you what. Let&#039;s try and work out how to seriously reduce the scale of problems the ninja world has. Any thoughts?”</p><p class="double">Dash slammed a hoof onto the table. “We gotta turn the country of Rain into the country of pleasant weather! Maybe then they&#039;d be less of jerks all the time.”</p><p class="double">Rummaging in her pocket, Twilight withdrew one of her trusty PADDs. “Let&#039;s see... yep... yep... that can be blamed on him too... that may be a plot hole... yep... no... and yep.”</p><p class="double">She looked up. “Well, I found the source of about eighty percent of all the problems in the Ninja world ever.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, let me guess,” Applejack said sarcastically.</p><p class="double">“Exactly. Madara Uchiha.” Twilight projected an image onto a wall. “This guy is responsible for just about everything.”</p><p class="double">“So, what&#039;s the plan?” Dash asked. “We hit him until he stops?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Twilight replied, projecting up another picture. “This is, as we know, Orochimaru. He&#039;s responsible for most of the remaining twenty percent.”</p><p class="double">Rarity shivered. “The snake motif is <i>not</i> doing it for me. There&#039;s such a thing as going too far.”</p><p class="double">The others gave her sidelong glances.</p><p class="double">“What?” she asked, looking back at them. “Spikey-wikey is a dragon. Completely different.”</p><p class="double">“<i>I&#039;m</i> not arguing with you.” Twilight shook her head. “We&#039;re getting off track. Anyway, I think I see an opportuinty for societal engineering. We&#039;re between Ninja Wars right now, so... who in Equestria do we know is an experienced psychologist?”</p><p class="double">“I learned!” Pinkie said, raising a hoof.</p><p class="double">“...I think we&#039;ll put that in the emergency folder,” Twilight decided. “You&#039;re a little... exuberant at times.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy cleared her throat. “I am qualified and have doctorates.”</p><p class="double">“That works,” Dash said.</p><p class="double">“I think Luna can do it by dreamwalking, too...” Twilight mused. “I&#039;ll ask her.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p><b>“So,”</b> Kurama said, lying back on a gigantic couch. <b>“Part of it is, I feel like the Sage just... abandoned us. We were only just created, and he left us – and his sons were complete-”</b></p><p class="double">Luna shook her head. “We can relate, in a sense. Did We tell you the story of Our banishment?”</p><p class="double">The huge fox twisted to look at her. <b>“No, actually.”</b></p><p class="double">“Perhaps &#039;twill prove useful for thy own actualization.” Luna closed her eyes. “Ere long ago, perhaps so long as the time thy Sage had so recently made the moon...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So...” Madara said slowly. “You want to &#039;cure&#039; me, little summon?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t think I have a problem in the first place.” His eyes twisted into the Mangekyo. “So-”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy met his gaze.</p><p class="double">To an onlooker, it would have been as though little explosions of pure optic intent were going off between them.</p><p class="double">“...why did Izuna always manage to do everything right?” Madara asked plaintively. “I tried as hard as I could...”</p><p class="double">“There, there,” Fluttershy said, trotting over. “Just let it out, you&#039;ll feel better.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the book in her hooves.</p><p class="double">It was one of Jiraiya&#039;s. It was also rather better written than normal – though the subject matter was about the same.</p><p class="double">“I never should have let him and Dash collaborate...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">36.7</p><p class="double">“Oh, gods, where are we <i>now?”</i> a somewhat scruffy unicorn asked, adjusting his floppy hat. He then paused.</p><p class="double">“And how did I do that?”</p><p class="double">The glasses-wearing earth pony next to him shrugged. “I don&#039;t know either. Still, this looks like another one of those Fused Loops.”</p><p class="double">“Great. More exciting things to run away from.”</p><p class="double">A large pegasus flapped down to land next to them in a whir of wings. “Greetings!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, not <i>you</i> again,” the unicorn muttered.</p><p class="double">Looking down at himself, the pegasus frowned. “I am fairly sure it <i>is</i> me.”</p><p class="double">“Wait – what&#039;s that on your, er... arse?” asked the unicorn, pointing.</p><p class="double">“It looks like...” the earth pony squinted closer, adjusting his glasses. “A carrot.”</p><p class="double">“How appropriate,” the unicorn said, then his eyes widened and he turned to look at his own flank. “What in the gods&#039; name is <i>this?”</i></p><p class="double">“A dotted line around... a staff-shape, I think.” The pegasus shook his head. “No idea.”</p><p class="double">“And mine is... a pair of flowers.” Shrugging, the earth pony looked around. “Do you think we should try and find out where the nearest town is?”</p><p class="double">“No,” the unicorn replied promptly. “I like the sound of quiet.”</p><p class="double">“I believe there is a town on the horizon,” the pegasus said, pointing. “I don&#039;t know exactly how far, though.”</p><p class="double">“I can handle it.” With a shy smile, the earth pony closed his eyes.</p><p class="double">Abruptly, there was <i>something</i> there. The <i>something</i> was very, very big, a gorgeous gold in colour, and possessed of many scales.</p><p class="double">“Hello, Ninereeds!”</p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t know how you keep doing that,” the unicorn muttered. “Twoflower, do you really want us to go flying into the air on him?”</p><p class="double">“You didn&#039;t have a problem with it before, Rincewind,” Twoflower pointed out.</p><p class="double">“I have come to terms with a fear of heights,” Rincewind defended. “It is an old friend, who I meet most weeks. However, the fear of <i>falling off</i> is rather stronger than normal, on account of my uncharacteristic lack of hands.”</p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t wizards cast some kind of spell to stop them falling?” the pegasus asked, frowning faintly.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ve been over this before, Carrot,” Rincewind said with a wince. “Even <i>if</i> other wizards can do it – and I&#039;m not at all certain they could – I... sort of can&#039;t. I&#039;m not what you might call <i>good</i> at casting spells. I&#039;m more of a theoretician.”</p><p class="double"><i>Do not worry, Rincewind,</i> Ninereeds projected. <i>I am quite good at catching falling wizzards. Surely you remember the many times I have been able to practise?</i></p><p class="double">“I&#039;d rather not, thank you...” Rincewind grimaced. “Oh, well, why wait for trouble to find us? We may as well meet it while there&#039;s still daylight to run away in.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“...well, that&#039;s quite an entrance,” Twilight said, as the huge dragon gently glided down to rest in the main square.</p><p class="double">A unicorn clutching a hat to his head with one hoof staggered down from the dragon&#039;s side, and collapsed on the floor.</p><p class="double">“I never want to go flying again.”</p><p class="double">“You said that last time,” said the dragon&#039;s... well, presumably rider, based on stance.</p><p class="double">“I mean it this time.”</p><p class="double">Trotting over, Twilight raised her voice. “Hello! Welcome to Ponyville. My name&#039;s Twilight Sparkle.” As she got closer, she lowered it again. “I&#039;m the local Loop Anchor, if that helps.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re the local anchor?” Hopping down from his perch, the earth pony fumbled around for a moment and brought out... a camera? “Can I get a photo? I like to have one of each anchor.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight answered. “Oh, who are you?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Twoflower,” the earth pony replied, checking on his device. A small lizard blinked sleepily at Twilight from the flash pan. “My friend there is Rincewind – he startles easily.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, so <i>you&#039;re</i> the loopers for the Disc?” Twilight smiled. “I have to say, it&#039;s nice to meet you.”</p><p class="double">“Pleasure,” Twoflower returned. “This is Ninereeds – though if you know about the Disc, you might well have guessed that.”</p><p class="double"><i>Hello, Twilight Sparkle.</i></p><p class="double">“And hello to you as well, Ninereeds.” Twilight looked directly at the dragon as she spoke. “I seem to remember Hiccup mentioning you once?”</p><p class="double"><i>Ah, that one. Toothless is most fun.</i></p><p class="double">“They certainly made me welcome,” Twoflower said. “Say &#039;butter!&#039;”</p><p class="double">FLASH.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Ah, so you&#039;re a looper as well?” Twilight sat back in her chair, as Spike passed around tea. “Thanks, Spike.”</p><p class="double">“No problem.” Spike handed Carrot his, and pulled over a spare chair.</p><p class="double">“I am,” Carrot nodded. “It&#039;s been... interesting.”</p><p class="double">He grimaced at his new hooves. “I certainly have new understanding of some of Angua&#039;s troubles...”</p><p class="double">Twoflower peered under a bookshelf. “Come on, Rincewind. Stop hiding under there.”</p><p class="double">“I am waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Rincewind said indistinctly. “It always does.”</p><p class="double">“Well, unless things not related to your arrival are seriously askew, then we should be fine.” Twilight grinned. “There is the matter of the dark goddess who should show up tomorrow morning-”</p><p class="double">Rincewind tried to get further under the bookshelf.</p><p class="double">“-but since we can handle her without breaking much of a sweat, I think we should be fine. And the same for the...” Twilight paused and counted. “Three other Princess-level or higher threats, half-dozen or so large monsters, and sundry minor catastrophes.”</p><p class="double">She chuckled. “I&#039;m teasing. Equestria is actually sort-of officially designated a sanctuary loop. We&#039;ll try to make your stay as comfortable as possible.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Twoflower walked back over, apparently abandoning Rincewind to his position under the bookshelves for now. “Don&#039;t worry, he&#039;ll come out eventually.”</p><p class="double">“Try me!” Rincewind called.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Whistling, Discord slid the book containing the Elements back into the bookshelf.</p><p class="double"><i>Hide it in plain sight.</i> Hilarious!</p><p class="double">As he turned to go, the bookshelf moved.</p><p class="double">“Oh?” he asked, peering under the bookshelf with one eye. Then he put the eye back in and bent down. “Hello, little pony.”</p><p class="double">“Wizzard, thank you!” a voice said back.</p><p class="double">Reaching in, Discord pulled out a blanket, a bathtub and three sets of goggles before finally towing a somewhat-scruffy unicorn out by the tail.</p><p class="double">“What were you doing in there?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn closed his eyes. “This cannot go well.”</p><p class="double">“How astute!” Discord poked his new prey in the cutie mark, which flashed, and grey spread all over his body.</p><p class="double">Then the building exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...oh, I almost forgot about him. Whoops...”</p><p class="double">Twilight and the others watched Discord flee across the fields, pursued by about fifty high-grade spells and a unicorn whose eyes blazed with eight-coloured fire.</p><p class="double">Twoflower winced at a particularly bright Ultima. “You know, I think Rincewind would be quite good at spells by now, if he just used a system other than the UU standard. He certainly knows <i>all</i> the theory.”</p><p class="double">They sat back to watch the fireworks for another few minutes.</p><p class="double">“Should we help him?” Carrot asked. “I mean, I know he&#039;s a criminal, but that <i>can&#039;t</i> be due process.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>36.8</p><p class="double">“Okay, boy, ready?” Spike said, bouncing on his claws.</p><p class="double">Peewee nodded.</p><p class="double">“Play dead!”</p><p class="double">The little phoenix chirped once, then erupted in a searing column of fire.</p><p class="double">Twilight chose that moment to walk in. “...okay. Spike, what am I looking at, and what&#039;s the reasonable explanation?”</p><p class="double">“Well, you&#039;re looking at a pillar of smoke and flame in the middle of the library,” Spike summarized.</p><p class="double">“Right. And the reasonable explanation?”</p><p class="double">The pyre died down, revealing an adult phoenix. Taking a single circuit around the room, singing, he then settled on Spike&#039;s shoulder and began to preen.</p><p class="double">“...that.” Spike pointed. “I taught Peewee a new trick.”</p><p class="double">“And you absolutely <i>had</i> to try it out on the library table?” Twilight asked, conjuring a dustpan and brush out of what had been a set of plaster ducks.</p><p class="double">Her assistant winced. “Oops. Well, in my defence, there <i>are</i> cookies cooling in the kitchen, and we might have got ash on them.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Well, I suppose I can forgive a lot for a cookie. But we have a laboratory for a reason!”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged. “Trixie&#039;s in it, I think.”</p><p class="double">“...fair enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>36.9 – Elmagnifico</p><p class="double">Macintosh poured the fermented liquid into a carefully measured, reinforced container. It fizzed there for a second before settling down. He slid it next to two glasses of more mundane cider, where it would stay unless it was needed. </p><p class="double">This was one of those special occasions. </p><p class="double">&quot;So, this was ya&#039;ll&#039;s first kill?&quot; </p><p class="double">His customer sighed at her cider, her purple bangs almost hanging into it. </p><p class="double">&quot;No, but it&#039;s troubling me. There are so many questions. Jadis was a powerful witch, and in that world, those can always come back – she did, I brought her back. Probably guilt... So does it count? Could I have prevented her from using the Deplorable Word some other way? Would she have done so if I hadn&#039;t? She didn&#039;t use it in the books when she was getting overthrown. I&#039;ve had these arguments with myself often since then. I&#039;ve hurt things in self defence before, and fought eldritch horrors and creatures with terrible power, but this time I premeditated the destruction of a sentient being.&quot; </p><p class="double">The silence hung there for a second as Twilight paused. </p><p class="double">&quot;I wonder sometimes if there was a way to do it differently. I&#039;ve stopped evils with phenomenal cosmic power before without resorting to killing, and I had all the advantages of surprise and time. Perhaps a petrification spell, or illusion or transmogrification. I don&#039;t know. It was the only way I knew for sure would work.&quot; </p><p class="double">Macintosh wasn&#039;t sure what to say to that. He&#039;d never dropped a meteorite on someone&#039;s head. </p><p class="double">Quiet returned like a disapproving spectre. </p><p class="double">Twilight seemed content to stare at her drink despondently. </p><p class="double">Macintosh thought back.</p><p class="double">There was, in fact, something similar he&#039;d done. </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah remember mah first.&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight looked up at him, her expression urging him to continue. </p><p class="double">He hesitated. </p><p class="double">This wasn&#039;t like sharing the fact of his army experience, or even his looping. This was something deeply personal. A glimpse into his psyche, that could be used against him if shared recklessly. </p><p class="double">The violet eyes asking for elaboration reminded him that not only was he helping someone, this was a friend of his. One he could trust. </p><p class="double">&quot;It was one of them longer loops, just after th&#039; changeling invasion. A buncha them wound up scattered around tha countryside an&#039; started trouble. Royal guards arrived ta find an&#039; deal with &#039;em, but they musta missed one or summat. </p><p class="double">Mac realized he was rambling, and shook his head. </p><p class="double">&quot;The point being, one night ah just couldn&#039;t sleep. Took ta walkin&#039; tha grounds, checkin&#039; ta make sure everythin&#039; was tidy. Ah found it in one of the barns. It had taken the form of mah sister, probably waitin&#039; ta replace her that mornin&#039; or summat. It took me a minute to realize though. Ah thought ah was safe that loop. That Applejack was there, not some other mare.&quot; </p><p class="double">A tiny smile threatened Macintosh&#039;s face for a second. </p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;d probably kick mah shin but good if Applejack knew ah was talkin&#039; about her that way, but that&#039;s how ah thought back then.&quot; </p><p class="double">All trace of the smile vanished again as he got back on task. </p><p class="double">&quot;It tried to play it casual, like it couldn&#039;t sleep either. Wanted to make me think it was just makin&#039; sure the apples were growin&#039; right.&quot; </p><p class="double">He poked at his glass of cider with a quiet a sigh. </p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe ah took it as an insult. Ta imitate Applejack so well, and still be so off. To mock mah sister&#039;s depth of character that way.&quot; </p><p class="double">His voice took on a solemn, grim tone. This was no wistful matter. </p><p class="double">&quot;In any case, it made mah blood boil. Ah bucked it but good. Sent it sailing across the room an inta&#039; one of the barn&#039;s support beams. We built that barn to stand up to Rainbow Dash. Changeling snapped like a twig.&quot; </p><p class="double">Macintosh&#039;s frown deepened as he thought back, dredging up old excuses. </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah tried to rationalize it. That thing was gonna insinuate itself with mah family, cause no end of harm. No telling how it woulda reacted if ah tried to take it out nonlethally. Ah had no clue what kinda mumbo-jumbo them things could get up to. Better to neutralize it then and there. Ah liked that. Made it seem like a good thing. Like ah&#039;d helped. But it didn&#039;t stick.&quot; </p><p class="double">He looked the other looper in the eye. His voice softened. That wasn&#039;t Her, but it didn&#039;t change what he&#039;d thought then. </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah figured where that kinda thinkin&#039; might lead me.&quot; </p><p class="double">Then he switched his gaze to his cider, the heat in his ears drawing his eyes to the drink, and his mind back to the story. </p><p class="double">&quot;That night, ah made a vow. Ah would remember that changeling. Maybe what ah did was necessary. Maybe it wasn&#039;t. Didn&#039;t make it right. From that day forward, ah promised mahself ah would never be proud of what ah had done, whether ah did it again or not.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah know it&#039;s not the same, but ah figure hearing about somepony else&#039;s problem&#039;d help get your mind of yours.&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight spread a thin smile. It had no teeth, just a lip-quirk of appreciation. </p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re right. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s quite the same, but thank you. It&#039;s the thought that counts.&quot; </p><p class="double">The silence stretched on from there, but it was a different silence. Both Twilight and Macintosh watched the alcohol swirl in the glass between their ciders. A meditative scene. Two Loopers sharing a moment to contemplate their actions in the company of someone who understood, at least a bit. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>37.1 – Bobnik</p><p class="double">Princess Luna stood on the deck of her new ship, and watched as it tacked neatly about Equis and her sister&#039;s sun under the expert hooves of Twilight Sparkle. She marvelled at the view, the crisp clarity of the vacuum combined with the lack of any visible barrier to keep the air in. She turned her head upwards, and saw the patterns of light flow across the sails into the mast and down into the engines below.</p><p class="double">&quot;I assume it&#039;s some manner of force field holding the atmosphere?&quot; she asked the helmsmare.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. The inspiration came from a pretty weird loop though. In that universe, all of space had an atmosphere and an <i>ecosystem</i>. Strange, but very pretty. I hope you get the chance to see it.&quot; replied Twilight.</p><p class="double">Luna sighed. &quot;I hope I do too. The ride is so smooth, is the wind from the Sun normally so constant?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, but I challenged Rainbow Dash to control the solar weather over the entire surface of the Sun, all at once. This is for training, you&#039;ll have to get used to the chop later. Speaking of which, you&#039;re up, Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight moved aside and let Luna take the wheel. The Princess of the Night lit her horn and took active control of the helm. &quot;Celly has her surfboard, but I think I prefer this. For the moment at least, I&#039;ve had enough of being alone.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you hear that, you lollygaggers?&quot; yelled Twilight at the crew. Most of the local loopers were along for the ride, as well as a few specially selected guests. &quot;Your Princess actually likes your company! Look lively there, and trim the foresail! Lookout, are the skies clear?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Clear as a bell, Ms Sparkle!&quot; called back Pipsqueak from the crow&#039;s nest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then what course, Captain?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna straightened, the flowing of her mane in the ethereal winds matching the billowing sails above. She remembered a phrase from a loop that Pinkie (and apparently Gummy) had been in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Second star to the left, and straight on &#039;til morning.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.2 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p>X-COM loop</p><p class="double">Twilight came awake (with a small &#039;a&#039;) instantly as her proximity alarm spell went off. A Skyranger was incoming, which meant she should be going. Hopping out of bed, a quick brush spell and a bit of telekinesis and she was kitted out and ready to go. But first she had to keep her promise. She threw a scrying spell out to check where she was going, and went in a flash of teleportation.</p><p class="double">Kimiko was back on the front desk. Manager Urashima had offered to let her go off shift early to recover, but she&#039;d insisted on staying the course. Besides, she wanted to be there to say goodbye to Twilight. It was almost the end of her shift anyway, and certainly a quiet time in the lobby, so she wasn&#039;t exactly stressed. She pulled up the posted video and grinned to see the views were in the tens of thousands already. Let those awful military types try to hush that up!</p><p class="double">When she looked up Twilight was there. &quot;Just wanted to say goodbye. An X-Com team is almost here, and considering I&#039;m probably still top of their &#039;capture or kill&#039; list, best not to give them the chance.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kimiko came out from behind the desk and knelt down in front of her, offering a hug. &quot;I understand. When I think of what they did to you I get so mad...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight leant into the hug and returned it with a fore-leg over Kimiko&#039;s shoulder. &quot;It&#039;s okay, don&#039;t be too hard on them. You saw the sort of things they&#039;ve been fighting. Did they over-react in my case? Yes. Can I honestly blame them? Not so much. Those soldiers who are coming here put themselves in danger to protect people like you from those invaders on a daily basis, and I can respect that, even honour it. My big brother&#039;s a Royal Guard so I understands where they&#039;re coming from. However, that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m going to stick around and act as their target dummy. But I won&#039;t prank them, they&#039;re just following orders.&quot;</p><p class="double">She released the hug naturally, and stepped back. &quot;My issue is with their leaders, who seem to shell-shocked too adapt to changing circumstances. Still the best revenge is living well, and I intend to do just that while helping people out wherever I can. Just because they&#039;re going to be jerks doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m going to join them. You&#039;d better get back to your desk, they&#039;re on final approach.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she sat back down, she felt a slight warmth and tingle from the pocket where she&#039;d put the gemstone Twilight had given her, and saw the alicorn&#039;s horn glow gently. &quot;What&#039;s that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The stuff that dreams are made of.&quot; Twilight replied, grinning. &quot;Call it a good luck charm.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a roaring from outside in the half empty car park. &quot;Thank you, for everything, and farewell.&quot;</p><p class="double">She vanished in a flash of light just as the sound of jets died.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Operation Bring Night.</p><p class="double">Mission Brief.</p><p class="double">Site is isolated hot springss resort in Gifu province of Japan. Site appeared to be subject of a terror raid from what the satellites picked up incoming. However interference prevented satellites from getting good read on what happened when they made contact. There&#039;s also a strong possibility that Target Sparkle is on the scene, possibly as a lead element.</p><p class="double">Mission Objectives</p><p class="double">Assess situation at site.</p><p class="double">Capture or destroy Target Sparkle if present.</p><p class="double">Destroy all other extraterrestrials on site.</p><p class="double">Rescue any survivors.</p><p class="double">Additional</p><p class="double">Use of portable Psionic Damper has been approved. Use it to suppress Target Sparkle&#039;s abilities. Attempt capture only if there is no significant resistance, otherwise destroy it. This objective has priority over all others.&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lieutenant Suchiro Saname was the low man on the totem pole in team two, and the only native Japanese speaker. Combined with the fact that he was an assault specialist, trained to get up in an alien&#039;s face and blow it out the back of their head with his alloy cannon, it made him the obvious point man for this operation. As he approached the front doors of the hot springs, he checked the parking area. For a place that had supposedly been wrecked by aliens, it looked surprisingly intact, but the aliens had been approaching from the far side, where the actual baths were. </p><p class="double">The rest of the team spread to search the area, Major &#039;Ramrod&#039; Wallace, the team leader and sniper was behind him, covering his approach. He hadn&#039;t lit off his thrusters to take aerial overwatch, and probably wouldn&#039;t until they had something to fire at. Suchiro dashed forward to take cover behind one of the door lintels, and waited for the rest of the team to reach position before entering. Captain Irwin Goldfarb, one of the team&#039;s two Heavy Weapons specialists came up and pressed himself flat against the other lintel. In place of his normal heavy plasma cannon, he carried the newly built mobile Psionic Supressor.</p><p class="double">Ramrod spoke in English over their comm system. &quot;Saname, this is Ramrod. I&#039;ve got overwatch. Take the door.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suchiro spun round in a practised motion and went through the double doors, shoving them back as he scanned the lobby interior. He didn&#039;t know what he expected to see, but a receptionist calmly sitting at a desk wasn&#039;t it.</p><p class="double">She also didn&#039;t seem to be phased by a guy in plated body armour crashing therough the door, gun in hand. &quot;Good evening sir. I&#039;m afraid the sentai fan convention was last week. Do you have a booking?&quot; Kimiko might be willing to forgive these guys if Twilight so obviously had, but that didn&#039;t mean she wasn&#039;t going to have a bit of fun of her own.</p><p class="double">The soldier put up his gun and spoke in English, &quot;Lobby is clear sir. In fact, it looks like nothing&#039;s happened. The receptionist is still at her desk, and making jokes! I&#039;m going to talk to her.&quot; He turned his attention directly to her and replied. &quot;I&#039;m not here for the baths, miss. We had a report of... hostile activity. Have you seen or heard anything unusual?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you mean that group of aliens that attacked us, what&#039;s left is by the recycling bins around the side of the building, along with the other rubbish.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT!&quot; Suchiro&#039;s exclamation brought an immediate response. Goldfarb barreled in, side-arm out and free hand on the trigger for the Psionic Supressor. He might not know much Japanese, but he was enough of an anime fan to understand the loudly shouted, &quot;NANI!&quot; </p><p class="double">Kimiko kept her seat, and her composure. &quot;Do you need a double room, or two singles?&quot; Suchiro finally got his brain back in gear and called over the comm, once again in English, to silence the chatter.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is Suchiro, I&#039;m fine, everything&#039;s fine. The receptionist just claimed that the alien attack has been defeated, and the remains are around by the service area. I&#039;ll try and find out more.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kimiko&#039;s English was Japanese high school level, and had never been her strongest subject, however she understood the sentence perfectly. She tried to frame a comment in English, and found the words coming to her as easily as Japanese. &quot;I am right here, you know. The aliens came, Miss Twilight put up a shield over the Hot Springs and went out to fight them. She beat them like a Taiko drum, and Manager Urashinma had what was left put outside for collection.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight? A purple pony with wings and a horn?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now you come to mention it...&quot; Kimiko nodded, pretending to think deeply. &quot;Yes, yes she was.&quot;</p><p class="double">She noticed the way the two soldiers tightened their grips on their weapons. Suchiro continued to speak for them.</p><p class="double">&quot;So she was here? Where is she now? It&#039;s vitally important that we find her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She left just before you got here.&quot; Kimiko replied, her voice hardening. &quot;It seems she didn&#039;t want to give you another chance to shoot at her.&quot; That got them to look down and loosen their grips, looking slightly shame-faced.</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t understand Miss...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Kimiko Mizuno.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Miss Mizuno. I&#039;m Leiutenant Saname, Special Forces. She may look harmless, even cute, but she is a powerful and dangerous alien creature. We need to recapture her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is that what the pachinko machine your friend is carrying is for? To distract her while you sneak upon her?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not a...&quot; Suchiro glanced at the device Goldfarb was carrying, and found it had been replaced with a pachinko machine. Goldfarb unslung it, and a note fluttered off it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear X-Com soldiers. Don&#039;t worry, the real device is back in the Skyranger. I had said to Kimiko I wouldn&#039;t prank you, but I couldn&#039;t help myself when I saw that. A Psionic Suppressor? Really? That didn&#039;t stop me last time, so why did anyone think it would work this time? I can see this is more powerful, like a strobe rather than a searchlight, but it wouldn&#039;t work on me any more than the other one in my current form. I understand the technology at least as well as Doctor Vahlen (unsurprising, as it was her memories I copied) and I can assure you it&#039;s about as much use against my powers as that gambling machine.</p><p class="double">&quot;I bear no ill will towards the team that captured me, they were only doing their duty as they saw it, and I&#039;m even willing to make peace with your top brass. Tell Doctor Vahlen I apologise for copying her memories, but I needed information in a hurry, and unlike her method, her brain didn&#039;t need to be peeled like an onion, and chopped and fried like one at the same time. However, matching her knowledge of the aliens and their technology with my own of magic has brought up some surprising insights. I&#039;d be perfectly willing to give her them, and some of my memories of Equestria and my magical research in return as an apology.

Video footage confirms this, and demonstrates Target Sparkle has a number of extra-normal abilities beyond those demonstrated during REDACTED. The uncertainties in kill totals and aliens recovered come from one of these, where the target appeared to transmute aliens into potted plants and in one case a helium balloon. </p><p class="double">Preliminary examination of genetic data shows the plants to have close similarities in form to terrestrial plants, but no exact matches. The possibility exists that the target was merely using it&#039;s teleportation ability to exchange them, and place them in a holding area for further use, but no confirmation can be had. It has further been suggested that the entire attack was staged by Sparkle in order to appear heroic, heretoafter referred to as the Trojan Horse Hypothesis, but that can not be confirmed or denied at this time.</p><p class="double">Other abilities demonstrated included gross telekinesis in the tons range, manipulation of inter-molecular forces, energy projection and manipulation ability on the order of fighter mounted weapons, high degrees of kinesthesia and situational awareness and tactical skill. Target claimed some or all of these abilities came from it&#039;s studies of &#039;magic&#039; and &#039;redeveloping an ancient unicorn martial art&#039;. Target&#039;s threat level has been increased to Extreme Plus, a new threat level promulgated specifically for the target.</p><p class="double">Specific abilities to study include the manifestation of an energy-based weapon that was used as a melee weapon, changing to act as a sword, staff and lance at various times, and was capable of deflecting plasma fire. Any personnel using the term &#039;Poni Knight&#039; to describe this will be subject to 10 days detention and loss of privileges.</p><p class="double">Subject also created an indigo force field dome that covered an area of several thousand square metres and was recorded blocking multiple blasts from a Sectoid&#039;s primary weapons, but from witness reports was selectively permeable to matter. Duplication of this effect has alpha priority.</p><p class="double">Subject has been described as using a &#039;perimeter alarm spell&#039; to detect the approach of the aliens and the X-Com team. Whether it was true or not for the aliens (see Trojan Horse Hypothesis) it is evident that Target Sparkle became aware of the approaching team at a range of dozens of miles. The methodology of this effect is unclear, but it suggests that Target Sparkle will have advance warning of any overt move against it.</p><p class="double">The gold coins recovered from the site are artefacts left by Target Sparkle in payment for the services of the Omachi Hot Springs. A separate analysis of these artefacts is under way under the project title &#039;Cortez&#039;. Remuneration for the confiscated artefacts is strongly suggested to obtain continued assistance of locals. Invoice Cortez 0003 has been sent to REDACTED. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am only going to ask this once.

It was her first loop &#039;outside&#039; of Equestria, and judging from the pitying looks everypon- everybody kept giving her, it would be a &#039;doozy&#039; to use Pinkie&#039;s colorful commentary. She was in some kind of loop where ponies had fled to another world to escape some catastrophe on Equestria, ending up on another planet that sounded a lot like the &#039;hub&#039; world she had been told of. They had joined forces with the local humans to form a grand Earth Alliance that had taken to the stars.</p><p class="double">A pity her part in it wasn&#039;t so good. Since she had woken up, she had seen the local version of her father die, had been put through five different kinds of hell, especially by that annoying twit Mollari and the local loopers. She was replacing the normal second most common looper, one Cmdr. Ivonova, second in command of some kind of crazy diplomatic station called B5. Her best friend in the multiverse had been brainwashed and twisted by the really creepy local group known as the Psicorps. There was almost nothing left of the filly she used to love to hang out with.</p><p class="double">And she wasn&#039;t even allowed to smack somepon- somebody upside the head when they did something really, REALLY stupid and forced her to work overtime to fix it.</p><p class="double">Like right now. All the local loopers seemed to be running around trying to patch something up, too busy to even bother telling her what in Tartarus was going on, and here she was having to deal with a survey team that had somehow ticked off the supposedly dead planet below them. Yeah, right. Dead enough to launch enough missiles to blow a crater where Mt. Canter used to be. Ah, screw it. Screw decorum, screw playing her part as a good little officer. Screw being nice!</p><p class="double">&quot;And one other thing to contemplate on your way back here; the Babylon 5 Mantra.&quot; Tiara leaned onto the live microphone button, angling closer to the recorder. &quot;Lt. Tiara is Always Right. I will Listen to Tiara. Tiara is Next to Celestia. And, if this ever happens again, TIARA WILL PERSONALLY RIP YOUR LUNGS OUT!&quot; </p><p class="double">She looked around at the shocked expressions and crewmembers both leaning away from her and cowering behind their consoles. Was she... panting? Holy crap. Maybe a bit too much stress relief. She pulled herself away from where she had been hunched over, straightening her jacket as she hoped that the button hadn&#039;t broke. Gingerly, she tapped the microphone button again, speaking calmly. &quot;Have a nice day.&quot;</p><p class="double">Growling, she blew a stray lock of her mane out of her face as she wanted to cry. The slightest whisper of a thought brushed against the rather irritating new sense she had gained when she had arrived. Apparently, the looper she had replaced was a &#039;telepath&#039;. or at least a weak one. By the local scale, a P1, maybe a P2. Just enough to occasionally listen, not even enough to get into somebody&#039;s head. Ugh, another reason to hate the Psicorps, who made Twilight &#039;CLOCK! IS! TICKING!&#039; Sparkle look relatively sane. They would snatch her up in a second and brainwash her just like Silver Spoon had been if they found out.</p><p class="double">She turned to her fellow officer of the watch, who discretely covered his snickers with his hand. &quot;You have a problem with that, Corwin?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only that you didn&#039;t do it sooner, Ma&#039;am.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you saying I should start putting the fear of Tiara into the hearts of every man, woman, and filly on this station?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Respectfully, Ma&#039;am? Yes Ma&#039;am. It wouldn&#039;t be the same without it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great. I spend forever trying to forget how to be mean, and now people WANT me to be mean. What&#039;s next? Luna herself gracing CnC with her presence after a thousand years? At least the planet&#039;s not going to blow up on us or something else stupid like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uhhh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Damnit.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.5 (FanOfMostEverything):</p><p class="double">Twilight came to a halt in the doorway of the bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;Close th&#039; door, please,&quot; Big Mac said gently. &quot;Don&#039; want flies in here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;R-right...&quot; Was this a prank? Nopony else was here, so there were no expressions to gauge but Macintosh&#039;s own intense, focused serenity. It also meant that Twilight was the only one to address the elephant in the room. &quot;Is that a...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">If Twilight hadn&#039;t needed a drink before, she certainly did now. &quot;<i>How!?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Funny ol&#039; fella showed me this trick.&quot; Big Mac stuck his tongue out a bit as he arranged a tiny pile of scree on the north face of his bonsai mountain. &quot;More t&#039; earth pony magic than helpin&#039; plants grow, y&#039;know.&quot; He blinked, then looked up from his work. &quot;Ah&#039;m sorry, Ah&#039;m bein&#039; awful rude. What kin Ah get ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight collapsed onto a barstool, eyes still locked on the tiny peak. &quot;Whatever will make this make sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion considered this for a moment. &quot;Ah&#039;ll go find that one batch Trixie helped me make.&quot; A beat. &quot;An&#039; some tongs.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.6 (Masterweaver):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh are you so sure about that?&quot; Trixie challenged with a smirk, smacking down a card. &quot;Well, I spent my Ice Cream Truck profits on a walrus!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. &quot;Welp, there goes my west fort.&quot; A feral smile formed on her face as she slid a card out from under her miniature. &quot;Shame, too, it was guarding the Breakout Character.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? No!&quot; The unicorn looked the board over in dismay. &quot;The walrus can&#039;t be my flagship, not this late in the game!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aaaaand now it&#039;s my turn.&quot; With a flourish, on final card was placed in front of the pegasus. &quot;Musical number! All those who don&#039;t participate get deported.... oh, look at that, Walruses don&#039;t dance. Who would have thunk it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie shook her head and leaned back, dropping her cards with a sigh and a smile. &quot;Well well well. Good game, Chrysy. I have to admit, I thought I had it in the bag after I took out your Tome of Eldritch Lore, but....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord is a devious game designer...&quot; The pony across from her flipped her mane. &quot;And I am a devious game player. It&#039;s only natural I should <i>oh no he&#039;s here just act natural.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave her a look of confusion before glancing at the coffee shop entrance. Shining Armor was walking in, humming to himself as he trotted up to the counter. Trixie turned back to her date with a half amused grin. &quot;Oh fine, I won&#039;t let your old flame see you--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He doesn&#039;t know I&#039;m looping!&quot; Chrysalis hissed. &quot;I don&#039;t even know if he knows about the slave loop and... just, please, don&#039;t tell him!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait... he doesn&#039;t know?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis slumped in her seat. &quot;I... it&#039;s not him, but... it looks like him and... I don&#039;t know, I just can&#039;t. Please, Trixie, don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie?&quot; Shining Armor walked up. &quot;Wow. Small world! And who&#039;s your friend?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This? This is... Crys<i>tal</i> Shard.&quot; Trixie laughed. &quot;Yeah, she saw one of my shows and couldn&#039;t get enough of me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...m&#039;llo,&quot; mumbled the pegasus.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there!&quot; The captain of the guard gave her a gentle smile. &quot;Don&#039;t let me intimidate you. Just a servant of the country.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...m&#039;kay.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining gave her an odd look. &quot;...okay then.... Trixie, sorry for interrupting. I didn&#039;t realize you were on a date!&quot; The stallion nodded politely before taking his coffee and trotting out.</p><p class="double">Trixie took a breath, counting quietly as she refocused her mind.</p><p class="double">Then she glared at Chrysalis. &quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me you never broke up with him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It – It&#039;s not him I-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh.” Trixie waved a hoof. “You know what I mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus wilted. &quot;I... I just... I can&#039;t. It was eighteen years, from my perspective. Eighteen whole years, and, and that was before I knew about the loops...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I... I want to move on, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed, her anger melting away. &quot;I see... You&#039;re going to have to deal with this eventually you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know. I just--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. No excuses.&quot; The unicorn looked away. &quot;I put on the Alicorn Amulet because of excuses. The first time, anyway. Just... if you want, I&#039;ll be there, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you. Twilight said she&#039;d be there too, but...&quot; Chrysalis smiled. &quot;I... would feel better if someone who <i>wasn&#039;t</i> at the wedding was there too. Just... not right now...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.7 (Misterq):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike looked at his body. Purple coat and horn, lime green mane and tail. That meant one thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m a pony this loop!&quot; the new unicorn colt exclaimed, &quot;Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">As the former dragon raced out of the library, he missed several details. The books were all very large and shelved on elegantly carved marble shelves. The piles of gems, meticulously sorted by size, shape, clarity, etc.. The fact that the entrance way was a series of magical barriers in a cavern-like hall.</p><p class="double">All these details came rushing back to him as he stood on the baloney-like ledge overlooking a series of crags and rocky spires. And there was Twilight and her friends. In the air. As giant dragons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on!&quot; Spike shouted as the memories integrated. He was still Twilight&#039;s helper, but now every pony was a dragon. Twilight and him lived in the town of Dragonville.</p><p class="double">Rairty was still white and very elegant in her dragon form. Twilight was still very recognizable as a relatively smallish purple scaled dragon. Rainbow Dash was a sleek looking flyer, the colour of a cloudless sky with rainbow-colored spikes. Applejack was an orange muscular dragon who would be a nightmare to battle. Fluttershy was busy hyperventilating, and Pinkie Pie was...</p><p class="double">Spike turned around slowly to stare into a wide grinning pink-scaled maw with far, far too many sharp pointy teeth in it.</p><p class="double">Yep. Pinkie Pie was still Pinkie Pie. On top of her head sat a small greenish goat - Gummy presumably.</p><p class="double">A shadow fell over everything. Spike looked up at the mind-bogglingly immense dragon body of Celestia as she gracefully glided in for a landing.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s it. If any dragon needs me, I&#039;ll be in the library,&quot; Spike said and turned around.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Spike,&quot; Rarity gently landed next to him, &quot;if memory serves correctly, most dragons in this loop have the ability to do one thing in particular.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, Rarity&#039;s body shrunk in on itself further and further until there stood Rarity, the unicorn. &quot;We can shapeshift.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike smiled. &quot;I can work with that.&quot; </p><p class="double">37.8 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;Pinkie, there is no Pink Lantern! Pink doesn&#039;t exist on the electromagnetic spectrum, it&#039;s basically negative green.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie just smiled. Not her usual lip-straining beam, but a content grin. &quot;Twilight, what do the various Lantern Corps channel, again?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn retrieved the notes she&#039;d prepared in the event of this Loop. &quot;Going in ROYGBIV order: anger, greed, fear, willpower, hope, compassion, and love.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded. &quot;Notice anything missing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it doesn&#039;t match Poll Ekmane&#039;s basic emotional classifications or Bobbin Plush&#039;s &#039;wheel of emotion.&#039; In fact, in Plush&#039;s model—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Happiness, Twilight. There&#039;s no happiness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight did not pout. She was far too mature for such petulant displays. &quot;I was getting to that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie held the hoofring — more a bracelet, really — up to the lantern. Twilight couldn&#039;t help but think that it would probably seem a lot more momentous if the ring wasn&#039;t cheap plastic and the lantern wasn&#039;t an immense hard candy. Still, Pinkie recited the oath she&#039;d made up with utmost seriousness:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;For every sorrow large and small,</p><p>My laughter will bring joy to all.</p><p>As long as someone has a ball,</p><p>Pink Lantern&#039;s light will never fall!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Rosy light bathed the room. For about a minute afterwards, Twilight just sat in place, boggling at the floating mare. Pinkie bided her time by playing a pair of marionettes she made from coherent joy.</p><p class="double">Finally, Twilight got up and made for the door.</p><p class="double">Pinkie drifted alongside her. &quot;Where you going?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To find Discord. Then, if he isn&#039;t responsible for this, the bar.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.9</p><p class="double">Blinking, Twilight looked up from her book.</p><p class="double">At least for once – for <i>once!</i> – she&#039;d not woken up mid-stride. Pity she was human, though, those usually tended to be the more problematic loops.</p><p class="double">And, scanning her loop memories, this was no exception.</p><p class="double"><i>Right... that little problem can wait. Now, what&#039;s going on?</i></p><p class="double">There was a ceremony in progress... something about summoned familiars.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around surreptitiously, pulled out a PADD, slipped it into her book, and got to text searching as names firmed in her memory.</p><p class="double">Her own familiar waved to her, prompting her to check her loop memories again – which distracted her for a moment, since she was fairly sure the normal issue familiar for her here wasn&#039;t Saphira... but this was a public place, so there was no chance to double check.</p><p class="double">Well, she could get on quite well with Saphira. All things considered, it could have been worse.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Kyuui...” Irukuru&#039;s head drooped. “Sowwy, Ewagon. Iwukuwu didn&#039;t mean to.”</p><p class="double">Eragon looked at the hole in his roof, and sighed.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry. I&#039;ll get it fixed.”</p><p class="double">As he turned for the saw, the blue Rhyme dragon squee&#039;d and glomped him.</p><p class="double">A grin stole over the Rider&#039;s expression, as he disentangled himself carefully from Irukuru and headed out to chop some new timber.</p><p class="double">For some reason, he wasn&#039;t at all resentful towards the Replacement for his normal dragon. She was just like an over-excitable little sister...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Done.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight closed her book with a quiet twik, and began to pay more attention as the girl she&#039;d identified as the main character stepped up to the podium.</p><p class="double">Here was where it would all get interesting...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Louise swallowed, and began to speak, hoping against hope that for once – for once – she would get the spell right.</p><p class="double">&quot;I beg of you… My servant who lives somewhere in the universe! Oh sacred, beautiful and strong familiar spirit! I desire and here I plead from my heart! Answer to my guidance!&quot; </p><p class="double">Her wand sparked to life... then there was a loud bang.</p><p class="double">In other words, more or less normal for Louise&#039;s magic thus far.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight frowned through the smoke. Something seemed... familiar.</p><p class="double">Then she heard a voice. A very familiar voice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Who summons Trixie?”</p><p class="double">As the smoke cleared, Louise saw who was speaking.</p><p class="double">A moderately sized... blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">Louise sat back hard, suddenly filled with euphoria. She&#039;d done it! She&#039;d summoned a familiar! She...</p><p class="double">Wait.</p><p class="double">Did that unicorn just talk?</p><p class="double">And why is it wearing clothes?</p><p class="double">The unicorn turned to her with a graceful movement, sending her cloak sweeping out in an impressively billowy arc, and looked her up and down.</p><p class="double">“Hm. Trixie supposes you may do.”</p><p class="double">“Aherm,” Mr. Colbert interjected. “Miss Louise, you must complete the binding.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow as the binding completed. Mjöðvitnir?</p><p class="double">Well, at least it made a little more sense than to have Trixie wielding a sword.</p><p class="double">Though, if Derfflinger was going to be free this loop...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So.” Trixie looked her new... &#039;master&#039; up and down. (She had her own opinions on who the apprentice was and who the master was). “Your magic is?”</p><p class="double">Louise hung her head. “Not very good. Everything I try just makes an explosion.”</p><p class="double">Trixie stood bolt upright. “And that is <i>not good</i> by the standards of this land? These foals are fools!” Louise actually saw the faint stars gleaming in Trixie&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">Trotting over, Trixie laid a hoof on her shoulder. “Trixie will teach you the number one tenet of her philosophy. There is <i>nothing</i> that cannot be solved with a sufficiently large detonation.”</p><p class="double">Dubiously, Louise looked at her familiar. “You think so?”</p><p class="double">“Trixie has made machines that go into <i>space</i> based solely on how big the explosion inside them is!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as Saphira walked calmly off the stage. The now-a-diamond stage. “I didn&#039;t actually know you could do that.”</p><p class="double">Saphira shrugged, and bent down to whisper. “It took me Loops to work out how to do it consciously.”</p><p class="double">Sitting back, they watched the final pair of master and familiar come on stage for the talent show.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Twilight added, pulling out two pairs of sunglasses. “You might want these. I know Trixie&#039;s style.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The shower of fireworks, explosions, sound effects and even illusions was so complex that it took the faculty almost five minutes to notice that the school was being robbed by a giant rock monster with a mage on top.</p><p class="double">Of course, Trixie and Louise noticed at about the same time. And then the golem exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...ta-da?” Trixie said, uncertainly, as the bits of rock and earth stopped raining down.</p><p class="double">Then, getting back into the groove, she slammed her hooves on the stage. “We hope that you enjoyed the show – despite the unexpected intrusion by...?”</p><p class="double">“Foquet, the Crumbling Dirt,” Louise picked up on the conversation. “It looks like even master thieves can&#039;t handle us!”</p><p class="double">Trixie laughed. “<i>That</i> was a master thief? Where I come from, master thieves will add locks to doors if they did not consider the locks already there enough of a challenge!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight facepalmed.</p><p class="double">“What?” Saphira whispered.</p><p class="double">“<i>She&#039;s</i> the one who did that.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie walked slowly up the steps, and into the room where Guiche and his girlfriend were.</p><p class="double">“You. The herbalist.”</p><p class="double">Montmorcery looked up.</p><p class="double">“Fix this.” Trixie gestured back at her apprentice, who was clinging to her right rear leg and muttering something about fuzzy ponies.</p><p class="double">“Oh, so <i>that&#039;s</i> where the love potion went...” Montmorcery mused. “Sorry, no can do.”</p><p class="double">“Louise?” Trixie said calmly.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Louise said, looking up.</p><p class="double">“It would make me happy if you did that to Montmorcery.”</p><p class="double">“What are you-aaagh!” THUMP.</p><p class="double">Surprisingly, having Louise be <i>her</i> problem instead of Trixie&#039;s made Montmorcery very cooperative indeed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Albion are invading!”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Trixie said loudly. “Twilight, we require your dragon.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked over. “For what? I <i>could</i> handle the air fleet by myself, you know...”</p><p class="double">“We require... a firing platform.” Trixie grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">That day went down in history as the Great Albion Turkey Shoot.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, to cut a very long story very short,” Trixie said, flicking absently at her singed hat, “it was the fault of the king next country over – Joseph, I think.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Are you two alright?”</p><p class="double">Trixie looked over at Louise. “We had to fight a giant robot. It was interesting.”</p><p class="double">Louise was still clutching her wand, in a grip that didn&#039;t look likely to slacken any time soon.</p><p class="double">“I still wonder how Eragon&#039;s doing...” Saphira said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Kitty!”</p><p class="double">“Please get off me,” the werecat leader muttered.</p><p class="double">“But you&#039;re so fuzzy!” Irukuru enthused.</p><p class="double">“I am so sorry,” Eragon said, sniggering. “She does this to everyone.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.10</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said, looking over the papers and artefacts in front of her. “Spike? I think we know what this Loop&#039;s &#039;thing&#039; is.”</p><p class="double">Spike walked in, balancing a fire ruby on his claw. “Oh?”</p><p class="double">“Basically, urban fantasy sort of thing. Werewolves, vampires, that sort of thing.”</p><p class="double">“Not... the Cullens?” Spike asked, shivering. “Loops with them in are never nice.”</p><p class="double">“No, no sign of them.” Twilight sighed. “The bad side of that is that it&#039;s likely at least one of our friends is one or another of them.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that is bad,” Spike agreed. “Let&#039;s hope we can get this done without too much bloodshed.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“It came in the window!” Daisy said, shivering. “A great big furry monster!”</p><p class="double">“<i>We</i> have fur, Daisy,” Twilight pointed out, taking notes. “It&#039;s just called a coat. Anyway, you were saying?”</p><p class="double">“It opened the window, climbed in, and took one of my flower arrangements!”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s pen paused. “It did what?”</p><p class="double">She looked over to the window. “Huh. So it actually reached in and opened it, rather than breaking the glass?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Daisy gulped. “And then it picked up one of my flower arrangements in those huge, fanged jaws, dropped something, and jumped out the window again!”</p><p class="double">Spike held up a small drawstring bag. “Was it this?”</p><p class="double">“...yes, it must be. I don&#039;t recognize it.”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s about five bits in here,” Spike reported, opening the bag carefully.</p><p class="double">“So, we have a werewolf who opens the window, takes a flower arrangement, and pays for it...” Twilight summarized. “I may know the solution.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How did you find me?” Fluttershy asked, covering her face with her wings.</p><p class="double">“Actually, it was pretty obvious...” Twilight said, shrugging. Though she had no intention of actually <i>explaining</i> her reasoning, given that Fluttershy wasn&#039;t awake, and &#039;another version of you likes to turn into a wolf&#039; would sound just a little bit insane.</p><p class="double">“I swear I ask before I drain them...” the pegasus muttered.</p><p class="double">“Wait, back up.” Twilight blinked. “You&#039;re the <i>vampire?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Fluttershy hunched over again. “I only go out on cloudy days, and because I have animal friends I can ask them for donations... Dash knows, she helps provide clouds when I need them...”</p><p class="double">“Well, don&#039;t I feel silly,” Twilight said in an aside to Spike, who shrugged.</p><p class="double">“So,” Spike said, frowning. “Who&#039;s the werewolf?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Whew,” Dash said, shaking her head. “That&#039;s pretty risky...”</p><p class="double">“I paid for it!” Scootaloo said indignantly. “People are nice if you pay for things!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but usually you buy them normally, not break in and leave money...” Dash touched the hyacinths, now sitting on her worktop. “I get that you wanted to be nice, but I wouldn&#039;t have needed to be bribed, Scoots.”</p><p class="double">“It wasn&#039;t a bribe...” Scootaloo said quietly. “I just wanted you to like me.”</p><p class="double">“Already do, squirt.” Dash walked over and laid a wing on the back of the pegasus filly. “But, wow, I&#039;m turning into some kind of secret-supernatural-pony-hiding-mare...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.11 (Nighzmarquls)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was obvious from the very instant Twilight Sparkle Awakened that this was turning out to be an odd one.

Of course, the job had some fringe benefits, such as hearty home cooked meals, and access to Apple Bloom&#039;s workshop. They were unaware that both she and Applejack were loopers, or that loops existed, but they knew a good thing when they saw it, and Apple Bloom&#039;s magitek inventions were far beyond anything they&#039;d ever come up with.</p><p class="double">The little filly had been friendly enough, but they&#039;d quickly learned she had a will of adamantine. Continued access to her lab, and the &#039;computer&#039; with all her ideas and information on had been dependant on doing a good job at the grunt work Applejack had set them. She&#039;d also forestalled any midnight expeditions by demonstrating that all the workshop&#039;s systems and access routes responded only to her. As a result they&#039;d been forced to stay true to their word, and found to their surprise that it wasn&#039;t all bad.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom might have been more knowledgeable than them in many areas (not to mention being able to kick both their plots together from what they&#039;d seen of her practising her martial arts) but she&#039;d also been willing, even eager to learn what they had to teach. As often happened, teaching what they knew had given them new insights, and ultimately they had managed to work out a way to replace unicorn magic with earth pony magic in her inventions. They&#039;d both been surprised to find out how good it had made them feel.</p><p class="double">However, they&#039;d put in their time, and now had a big trailer cart hitched to the back of the SSCS 6000, filled with some of Sweet Apple Acres finest. The machine itself had been rebuilt, sleeker and slightly larger. They hadn&#039;t even had to trick Apple Bloom into doing that, she&#039;d freely offered to help with the reconstruction and put the resources of her workshop to the effort. It was now as reliable as any device could be, and the thaumic boiler system had been redesigned to be self-sustaining, requiring only an initial zap of magic to activate it. Apple Bloom had also insisted on making a few additions of her own.</p><p class="double">The two brother stood in front of the machine, looking less lanky than they had when they&#039;d arrived. Days of farmwork and good solid farm cooking had added muscle to their limbs and a few inches to their waistlines. Applejack, at the head of the Apples grouped there to see them off, spoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I wasn&#039;t too sure about doin&#039; this in ther first place, but the two of you haven&#039;t stinted yourselves. Apple Bloom gives you a good report too, and reckons that contraption can put out cider worthy of the Sweet Apple Acres name. So, like I agreed to start with, you can sell under our brand, as long as you keep things honest.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gave them a stern look from under her hat brim. &quot;And trust me, we will know if you use cut quality or try to con your customers, there are Apples everywhere from Manehatten to Appleoosa. On the other hoof, they should be able to supply you with more apples when those run out. Playing fair and square may not make you money as fast as cheating, but it&#039;ll give you more over the long run.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry ma&#039;am,&quot; Flim said, &quot;We didn&#039;t have much of a choice when we first turned up here. Now we do, and the last thing either of us wants is to end up back where we started. Miss Apple Bloom, I hope we can keep corresponding. I have some other ideas that could use your input.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned at the respectful tone. &quot;Works both ways. I can always use a second opinion on some of my inventions. I hope you like what I&#039;ve done to the 6000?&quot;</p><p class="double">Flam had already climbed up into the steering sofa. &quot;We surely do! I can&#039;t wait to try it out in the open air!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack looked back and forth between them. &quot;Hey, what&#039;s this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom replied, &quot;Just something I came up with as a bonus for helping me work out how to use earth pony magic instead of unicorn magic in my inventions. It seemed a good way to test what I&#039;d learned.&quot;</p><p class="double">Flim climbed up alongside his brother. &quot;And we&#039;re glad to have helped. Okay brother, time to go!&quot;</p><p class="double">He plugged his horn into a socket on the control panel and fired a burst of magic into it before removing it bringing his head back up. &quot;Okay, thaumic boiler is running up to operating pressure... Ready Flim?&quot;</p><p class="double">Flim pulled a lever and there was a shrill whistle. &quot;Ready Flam!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa!&quot; Applejack called out. &quot;Y&#039;all just be careful backing up! You&#039;ll need some-pony to help guide you back out onto the road to Canterlot!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them grinned at each other, their horns glowed, and a pair of mirror shades appeared on each of them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where we&#039;re going...&quot; Flim started, and Flam finished, &quot;... we don&#039;t <i>need</i> roads.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 lurched gently and rose into the air along with the trailer as wheels folded up underneath it, glowing with levitation rune-sets. It glided forward and up, turning to get a clear run above the apple trees, then the vents at the back glowed with a flare of rainbow flame and it shot off into the sky with a cheery whistle. </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Took a while, but...” Sweetie shrugged. “Like I say, it&#039;s cool of you.”</p><p class="double"><i>Think nothing of it. It was an interesting little exercise.</i></p><p class="double">“Right.

It&#039;s what&#039;s called a bicycle.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus filly looked dubious. “How do you use it?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it&#039;s sort of like a scooter...” Sweetie slipped her right forehoof into one of the grip loops. “You have to have a kinda strange posture when using it, but it&#039;s really fast!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, this I gotta see.” Scootaloo unhooked her scooter from the cart they often used. “Betcha can&#039;t beat me!”</p><p class="double">Sweetie just smiled, slipping the other forehoof in and latching one of her hind legs to a pedal. “Ready when you are.”</p><p class="double">“ThreetwooneGO!” Scootaloo rattled off, and kicked – hard.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Thirty seconds in, Scootaloo felt quite good about the impromptu race.</p><p class="double">No way was Sweetie going to beat <i>her</i> at what she was best at!</p><p class="double"><i>Ring Cycle.</i></p><p class="double">“Eh?” Scootaloo risked a glance back. That hadn&#039;t sounded like Sweetie&#039;s voice...</p><p class="double">Then what <i>was</i> Sweetie&#039;s voice rose above the rattle of wheels, singing something in a language Scootaloo didn&#039;t know.</p><p class="double">And where was the musical accompaniment coming from?</p><p class="double">Then Sweetie blew past her in a rush of wind, still singing and with the wheels of her... <i>bicycle...</i> blazing a bright gold that almost hurt to look at.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You cheated!” Scootaloo accused, as she skidded to a halt outside the Carousel Botique. “That had to be magic!”</p><p class="double">Then she blinked. “Wait, where&#039;d the bicycle go?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie lowered a silver flute from her mouth. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d it go?”</p><p class="double">“I put it away.” Sweetie grinned. “Though, yeah, it did use magic. So does this.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo looked at the flute, still panting. “A magic flute?”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” The unicorn giggled.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t get it...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.2</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Sir,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I hope that this letter finds you well.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Actually, I don&#039;t really.

Then get to drawing up the court case.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re still not going to leave it?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">A dark blue blur shot into the room, paused, selected a book from the nearest bookshelf and shot off with a cry of &#039;Meep meep!&#039;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared for a moment.</p><p class="double">“Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight?” Trixie replied, with a hint of triumph.</p><p class="double">“I am sorry I ever doubted you. That road runner needs to go <i>down.</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.3 (Bobnik)</p><p class="double">The door of Big Mac&#039;s bar slammed open, and an agitated alicorn came through it.</p><p class="double">“Hoofrot, poxes and mange upon budget meetings! May the inventor of the committee rest unquiet in Blessed Lands forevermore!” cried Princess Luna.</p><p class="double">Celestia came through the door behind her sister, and while she was quiet and seemingly serene, Big Mac could tell she was as upset as Luna. It had taken him a long time to get over his own awe and learn to read the Sun Princess, but her eyes were empty, not just calm, a sure sign she had locked her emotions inside herself.</p><p class="double">Luna stomped up to the bar. “Sir Macintosh, please, give us a beverage from far beyond. Something new and different to chase away the memory of tax proposals we have heard a thousand times and more.”</p><p class="double">“It is rather trying, but we can&#039;t get in the habit of just ignoring them all the time,” said Celestia, “but something fresh and different would be just the ticket.” She shuffled her hooves and sighed, replacing false calm with genuine weariness.</p><p class="double">“Ah know just the thing. Have seat, and I&#039;ll bring it out.” replied Mac.</p><p class="double">When he returned with a large bottle and two glasses, the sisters had taken up seats in a corner booth, side by side. The looping bartender put the glasses on the table, and carefully poured a measure into each one.</p><p class="double">“Rarity gave a couple of cases of this to me just a day ago, &#039;parently she picked it up when she was Queen of England for a loop. Supposed to be made by giants, haven&#039;t heard the whole story yet. Apart from the Bearers and Spike, you&#039;re the first to try it.” he said as he poured.</p><p class="double">The liquid was a pale transparent green, and the noise as it was poured indicated it was fizzy. It had a scent like summer just shading into autumn. Oddly, as it was poured, an opaque layer formed on the bottom of each glass.</p><p class="double">“Giants, you say? Perhaps &#039;twas Harry Potter&#039;s Loop?” asked Luna, as her horn glowed and the glass rose to her muzzle. “Up with novelty, and down with boredom!” The glasses clinked together and both sisters took a hefty slug from the large tumblers.</p><p class="double">The flavour was redolent with berries and cream, but had none of the texture of a dairy product, and the bubbles chased the flavour down the throat with remarkable speed. There was no burn of alcohol, but a faint tingle showed there was some manner of magic in the drink.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I do like that,” said Celestia. “Very refreshing, and it&#039;s chased the cobwebs right out of my head.” She raised the glass higher to peer at the liquid. “Why, the bubbles are moving downwards!”</p><p class="double">It was true. The layer at the bottom of the glass was actually a head of froth, and the fizz descended through the glass to meet it. As Luna began to shift uneasily in her seat, Celestia noticed that Big Mac had retreated behind the bar at speed. She knew a pony taking cover when she saw it.</p><p class="double">Before she could open her mouth to inquire, the natural consequence of the downward-moving bubbles hit both sisters simultaneously. The noise was indescribable, and so loud as to shake the building. Mac&#039;s wisdom in sheltering behind the bar became apparent as loose objects were hurled about the room like a tornado had been let loose inside.</p><p class="double">In short, the Diarchy of Equestria farted so hard it blew them out of their seats.</p><p class="double">Luna scramble d backwards off the table where she&#039;d been blown as Celestia staggered back across the floor. Both of them stared incredulously at the miraculously intact drinks, then at each other, and finally accusingly across the room at the bartender.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup, frobscottle will do that.” said Mac, as he shook his head to clear it. “Y&#039;all still bored?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed not!” cried Luna, as she swept up her glass once more. “A toast, to the Equestrian Revenue Department. May their anthem resound eternal!” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.4</p><p class="double">“Hey, Twilight?” Pinkie said, grinning.</p><p class="double">“I dread to answer... yes, Pinkie?”</p><p class="double">“I worked out how I&#039;m gonna beat Nightmare Moon!” The pink pony held up her Ring. “Oh, can you put that shield spell on me, though, &#039;cause I&#039;m not all that practised with this and I&#039;d prefer to find out I can&#039;t do a shield in a learn-from-this-and-keep-going way, not a whoops-back-to-the-loop-start way.”</p><p class="double">Twilight waited a moment, to be sure Pinkie was done with that sentence. “Yes. I&#039;m doing it for everypony, -ling, and so on... though it does of course count as points against you if the mountain gets too damaged.”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Pinkie concentrated, and the Ring flared, then settled back to her coat colour.</p><p class="double">“Wait...” Twilight pointed. “Did you just-”</p><p class="double">“One hundred percent recharge is go!” Pinkie winked. “I just need to think of yay-I-can-do-the-same-birthday-party-over-and-over!”</p><p class="double">After a long minute, Twilight threw up her hooves, staggered for a moment and dropped back down onto all fours. “You know what, fine. You invented it, so presumably you know how it works.”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Pinkie&#039;s grin flashed as bright as her Ring had.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...last forever!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie trotted in through the stage entrance. “Hiya moonbutt!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s expression was a sight to behold.</p><p class="double">“Insolence!” she shouted, turning, and lighting up a spell on her horn. “Give me one good reason I should not simply destroy you now, and spare myself further insult!”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm...” Pinkie rolled her eyes up, pondering, and tapped her chin with one hoof. “Nope, can&#039;t think of one.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon unleashed a bolt of black fire, which narrowly missed Pinkie and set the wall alight. “There will not be another warning shot, peasant.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “Oh, you know my family?”</p><p class="double">“...pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Momma Pie and Daddy Pie are certainly peasants – though, more of smallholders, I suppose, so I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the right term. But you must have met them, &#039;cause otherwise you wouldn&#039;t get it right?”</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s an... insult...” Nightmare Moon mumbled, then remembered herself. “Trouble me no more, and you <i>may</i> keep your life.”</p><p class="double">“Okie dokie!” Pinkie nodded. “Hey, Nimmie?”</p><p class="double">The dark alicorn had only just turned back to the rest of the town. Her eye was seen to twitch as she turned once more. “<i>What?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Think fast!”</p><p class="double">Something glowing pink shot out from behind Pinkie&#039;s back, and fired a blue globe at the floor.</p><p class="double">Then, with a <i>bwuum</i> noise, a two-meter diameter hole appeared in the stage. On the other side was space.</p><p class="double">And quite a lot of escaping air.</p><p class="double">And, within a second or two, Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">In both a literal and metaphorical sense, it was simply <i>not</i> her day.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie let the construct vanish, and it took the portal with it.</p><p class="double">“Ta-da!”</p><p class="double">In the crowd, Twilight shook her head with a wince. So, Pinkie could use her Ring to create a portal gun.</p><p class="double">That was going to be... interesting...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“<b>Cryyst-”</b></p><p class="double"><i>vwum</i></p><p class="double">Pinkie counted. “Four, five, six-”</p><p class="double"><b>“taaaaaals!”</b></p><p class="double"><i>vwum</i></p><p class="double">Twilight followed Sombra as he fell through the blue portal, then came sailing down through the air from the orange one hundreds of metres up.</p><p class="double">For about the fiftieth time.</p><p class="double">“How long are you going to keep doing that?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “Until it isn&#039;t funny any more.”</p><p class="double">“Is that by your judgement or mine?”</p><p class="double">“Theirs,” Pinkie replied, pointing to a number of Crystal Ponies.</p><p class="double">By now, some of them were making popcorn.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.5</p><p class="double">Fluttershy lay back in bed and sighed, an all-too-familiar melancholia stealing over her.</p><p class="double">A Fused Loop was over, and now it was back to Equestria.</p><p class="double">Nice, safe Equestria. Same old Equestria.</p><p class="double">Twilight had mentioned this to them, back after the first couple of fused loops. It was sometimes hard to maintain perspective after seeing the multiverse like that.</p><p class="double">They&#039;d gotten used to it, after a while. Friends helped – though Twilight often had loops alone, being an Anchor was awful sometimes – and so did the perspective that came with age.</p><p class="double">But sometimes... it was worse than normal. Sometimes she&#039;d lost close friends, so recently made. All Loopers prepared for the possibility, she&#039;d known it was coming, but...</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny cut into her mope by kicking her bed hard enough to leave a dent.</p><p class="double">“Naughty rabbit!” Fluttershy scolded, rolling off the mattress and giving him a tolerant look. “Keep that up and I&#039;ll make you dust the bookshelf!”</p><p class="double">The threat bounced off Angel&#039;s armour like a rubber ball. He shrugged and bounced off to... well, probably threaten a songbird or something.</p><p class="double">A moment&#039;s check on her Loop memories reassured Fluttershy that this Loop had begun at the normal time. That meant that the Summer Sun celebration was just around the corner.</p><p class="double">Now, was there a song she hadn&#039;t taught her bird friends?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The doorbell tinkled.</p><p class="double">“Come in,” Fluttershy called softly. “It&#039;s unlocked.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee pushed the door open, smiling. “Hello, Fluttershy. Sorry to intrude – I know you must be busy with the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it&#039;s no problem,” Fluttershy replied. “I was just making some tea. Would you like some?”</p><p class="double">The teacher frowned, considering it. “Maybe later.”</p><p class="double">“All right.” Nodding, Fluttershy put the kettle back on the stove, just to one side to keep it at the right temperature. “What brings you out here?”</p><p class="double">Now <i>that</i> was the real question. Cheerilee certainly never came out here in a normal loop, so...</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s quite a puzzle, actually,” Cheerilee admitted. “You see, there&#039;s a child who Nurse Redheart and I found wandering around Ponyville this morning. He seemed quite confused, but was insistent that he meet you.”</p><p class="double">She stepped fully into the cottage, and turned to the door. “Come on in, Lemon.”</p><p class="double">A bright yellow earth pony colt walked in, a little unsteady on his legs, and his eyes locked onto Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blinked, then gasped.</p><p class="double">“Leman?”</p><p class="double">“So you <i>do</i> know him?” Cheerilee asked, satisfied. “I&#039;ll want to hear all the details – but later. Can I leave you to take care of him for today? I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve got work to do for the festival as well.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s fine,” Fluttershy said absently.</p><p class="double">The moment Cheerilee was out of the house, she let her happiness off the leash. “Leman! I thought I&#039;d lost you.”</p><p class="double">She knelt down, spreading her forelegs, and the colt stumbled forward into her embrace.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on...” Lemon Rush said, looking around the cottage. “The last I remember, we were on Fenris.” Preparing for a delegation from the Light Eldar Empire to arrive, actually.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Fluttershy thought for a moment as she poured the tea. “Okay. There are things called time loops, and people from one sometimes end up in another. This is my home one.”</p><p class="double">“It certainly looks more peaceful than mine,” the colt said, glancing out the window. “And warmer.”</p><p class="double">He paused. “Didn&#039;t you used to have a horn, little mother?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, of course.” Fluttershy closed her eyes, let the Element of Kindness flash into being, and Ascended. “I forgot, you&#039;ve only seen me like this.”</p><p class="double">“Neat trick. Can we all do that?”</p><p class="double">“No, sorry.” Fluttershy shrugged, reverting the transformation. “It&#039;s... complicated. Come on, I&#039;ll introduce you to Twilight, and she can tell you what you need to know about the Loops.”</p><p class="double">“That works for me.” Rush stood up, and nearly fell over.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s hoof swept out to steady him, and he gratefully used it to stand back upright. “This is humiliating...” he muttered, face burning beneath his coat.</p><p class="double">“I had just as much trouble with walking on two legs,” Fluttershy smiled. “And with flying, actually. I still have a preference for walking where possible.”</p><p class="double">She nuzzled him affectionately. “It&#039;s good to see you, Leman.”</p><p class="double">“And you.” The normally-a-primarch laughed. “At least I didn&#039;t make <i>too</i> much of a mess when I arrived! If I&#039;d acted more like the Emperor would have then I&#039;d have thought this was some sorcerous trick!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy winced internally as she bumped into Gilda. Normally she was able to adroitly avoid the belligerent griffin, but she&#039;d just... forgotten. Too much else to think about.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Gilda said, scowling, and then roared.</p><p class="double">The roar was cut off within about a second, as two bright yellow hooves thudded into Gilda&#039;s torso. Air wooshed out in a strangled squawk, and the impact sent her beak over tail onto the road some distance away.</p><p class="double">“Let me make one thing clear,” Lemon said, sounding more predatory than the griffin he was standing on top of – in spite of his high-pitched colt&#039;s voice. “You can challenge anyone you like to a fight. I don&#039;t mind that. But you force a fight with someone who can&#039;t protect themselves, and you answer to me.”</p><p class="double">“Lemon!” Fluttershy said, sternly. “I know she&#039;s a bully, but that doesn&#039;t mean you can bully her back.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, little mother,” he said, shaking his head and stepping off Gilda. “I don&#039;t like seeing you hurt.”</p><p class="double">“I know you don&#039;t,” Fluttershy replied. “But still.”</p><p class="double">He nodded.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy bent down to talk more privately. “When did you learn to fight like that?”</p><p class="double">The colt smiled. “I&#039;m a <i>primarch.</i> We&#039;re <i>made</i> good at fighting.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.6</p><p class="double">“Sleipnir?”</p><p class="double">The horse deity turned from his keyboards. (Yes, keyboards. Eight legs is helpful if you can multi-task.) “Yeah, mom?”</p><p class="double">Loki winced. “Stop-”</p><p class="double">“-calling you that,” Sleipnir finished. “Did you expect that any of your children would lack a sense of humour? It&#039;s <i>hilarious</i> how you react.”</p><p class="double">Shaking his head, the trickster held up a hand. “A very good point. Though, speaking of my children, I&#039;ve got a... request, from Fenris.”</p><p class="double">It was Sleipnir&#039;s turn to wince. “I haven&#039;t forgotten when he chased me all around the room at his party.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re a horse, he&#039;s a wolf, it&#039;s natural.” Loki&#039;s grin was back on his face. “Anyway. One of the Loopers <i>he</i> keeps an eye on needs a break. Badly. Is there a slot in one of your worlds you can drop her into?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Sleipnir turned back to his computer, and started typing away. “There is one relatively controllable fused loop opportunity coming up for Equestria, so I can drop her into that when her next out-loop slot comes in.”</p><p class="double">“As soon as possible.” Loki paused. “Fenris is going to spend a <i>lot</i> of power on giving her this.”</p><p class="double">“Well, if it&#039;s that urgent...” Sleipnir tapped a few more controls. “There, done.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight...” Spike said, slowly reaching for his &#039;saber. “You might want to see this.”</p><p class="double">His tone of voice was warning enough. Twilight stepped quickly up to the window. “What?”</p><p class="double">All she could see was a fairly normal market day in Ponyville – the first following the Summer Sun celebration, true, so a little more nervous than normal, but nothing major.</p><p class="double">Spike pointed, indicating a pale blue earth pony mare. “Her.”</p><p class="double">Twilight squinted. “I still don&#039;t see it... is she a Looper?”</p><p class="double">“Must be. And not a local.” Spike shot a glance at Twilight, then his eyes widened. “Oh! Sorry, I keep forgetting you&#039;re not an empath.”</p><p class="double">“Just experience, that&#039;s all I have,” Twilight said with a shrug. “So, what is it?”</p><p class="double">“That mare is about a hoof-length short of snapping. The Force feels like... like lightning&#039;s about to strike.” Spike&#039;s expression clouded. “The last time it felt this bad was... well, suffice to say force psychosis was involved.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced, wondering if <i>he</i> had been the one involved. She knew Spike had had the occasional issue with control – every Looper had – but she hadn&#039;t pried. Courtesy.</p><p class="double">“So...” she mused. “What do we do?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Spike cracked his knuckles. “I&#039;m the one with battle precognition, so I&#039;ll go talk to her. You send for the others and then hang around in case I need support.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Excuse me?” Spike said, as calmly as he could with his reflexes on high alert.</p><p class="double">It was strange, feeling the fury and despair roiling from the mare&#039;s mind as she turned to him with a polite “yes?”</p><p class="double">Whatever else, she had impressive emotional control.</p><p class="double">“Well, I was wondering...” Spike considered, then went for broke. “Are you new to this loop?”</p><p class="double">Her eyes widened. “Loop? Do you mean-” The question went unfinished.</p><p class="double">“Time Loops, yes.”</p><p class="double">“Are there such things as vampires here?” she asked, the words almost tumbling over one another.</p><p class="double">“No,” Spike replied firmly.</p><p class="double">“Are there such things as <i>werewolves </i>here?”</p><p class="double">That one took a moment more thought. “No true werewolves, one hobbyist.” Fluttershy was Awake, after all.</p><p class="double">The mare exhaled. “Right. <i>Right.</i> Thank you for the help.”</p><p class="double">“Hold on,” Spike added, before she turned to go. “What&#039;s your name?”</p><p class="double">“Clear Water,” she answered, and left at what looked like a cross between a canter and a lope.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, any ideas?” Spike said, having finished reporting the conversation to the rest of the local Loopers.</p><p class="double">“I think I know.” Twilight winced. “And if she&#039;s who I think she is, then she is in serious need of help.”</p><p class="double">“Well, don&#039;t keep us in suspense, dear,” Rarity admonished.</p><p class="double">Twilight reached into thin air, rummaged for a moment, and plonked a set of books down on the table.</p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>me</i>,” Dash muttered, as they all looked at the front covers of the <i>Twilight</i> books.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Leah Clearwater sat back on her hind legs in the forest, not far from where she&#039;d... appeared.</p><p class="double">No vampires. No werewolves.</p><p class="double">For once, she was safe.</p><p class="double">Bending down, she bit off some grass. It tasted... bland, really.</p><p class="double">She could live with that. Boring was something she needed.</p><p class="double">Every rustle of a twig, every errant breeze... they set her off. Made her fine-tuned instincts scream warning, after hundreds of years of living on a knife-edge.</p><p class="double">It was a simple equation.</p><p class="double">Meet Edward Cullen when in human form, he finds out about her having travelled in time – and about her deep and abiding hatred of him.</p><p class="double">Get too close to the pack when in wolf form, they find out the same thing – and a less bitter but still intense dislike.</p><p class="double">Mistakes had gotten her killed before.</p><p class="double">But she was <i>safe</i> here.</p><p class="double">“Safe,” she murmured. Willing herself to believe it.</p><p class="double">It would take some doing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight finally said, some hours later. “I think that&#039;s everything.”</p><p class="double">Fifty or so suggestions had been pared down to the more realistic ones, and then again to the most important ones.</p><p class="double">Equestria was a sanctuary loop, but technically their responsibilities ended there... but none of them felt comfortable <i>not</i> helping someone in that much trouble.</p><p class="double">Stretching, the Anchor peered out the window at the long shadows of evening. Then blinked, and looked at a clock.</p><p class="double">“Your Highnesses...” she said, weakly. “You&#039;re late.”</p><p class="double">Celestia and Luna sat bolt upright in their chairs, exchanged a look, and changed day to night in seconds.</p><p class="double">“Sorry,” Luna said with a wince. “Lost track of time.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Happens to all of us. I think I forgot the first time I was a Royal Sister... something about a research binge, and then the guards started asking why it was still Tuesday.”</p><p class="double">Scattered chuckles greeted that remark.</p><p class="double">“Anyway...” Twilight turned to Spike. “Can you check?”</p><p class="double">He nodded, and closed his eyes. Three long, deep breaths, and they opened again. “I think she&#039;s asleep.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight nodded at the princess of the night. “You&#039;re up.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A pair of ice-cold eyes were staring down at her.</p><p class="double">She ran, but nothing she could do got them off her. They were digging into her, revealing all her secrets to a man who had killed in the past and would kill in the future if he felt it to his advantage.</p><p class="double">In a panic, she phased to wolf. The eyes closed, but nine other sets of pitiless golden eyes opened, all around her.</p><p class="double">A kind of pitying dislike battered her thoughts. Contempt for her skills. Fear of the outlier – the female werewolf. Resentment that she dared to phase in front of them, coupled with lingering images of her own body – attached to an unmistakeable emotional overlay that made her feel dirty.</p><p class="double">Hard to tell her thoughts from theirs. Impossible to keep secrets.</p><p class="double">Her father, dying of shock from seeing her change shape. Her brother, upset to see her. Her boyfriend, with eyes only for another – again, and again, and again.</p><p class="double">Self-loathing. What was wrong with her body? Why didn&#039;t it just <i>work?</i> Even when she didn&#039;t phase, it never... worked.</p><p class="double">Then the flood of memories... stopped, as though cut with a knife.</p><p class="double">A full moon shone gently down on her, in a calm and quiet forest.</p><p class="double">The images, wolves and vampires, melted away.</p><p class="double">“Leah Clearwater?”</p><p class="double">She raised her head, looking for the speaker, and shifted back to human. “That&#039;s me.”</p><p class="double">From a pool of moonlight, a... well, a winged unicorn... faded into view. “This is a dream – it was a nightmare, and a bad one. Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">She chuckled. “I&#039;ve been worse.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn nodded. “You are currently in Equestria&#039;s time loop, not your own. I have the ability to walk in dreamscapes, and wished to come here to extend an offer to you.”</p><p class="double">Leah blinked. “Okay. Sure.” She shook her head, as memory returned. “I&#039;m in horseland at the moment.”</p><p class="double">“Equestria,” the unicorn stressed slightly. “I am Princess Luna, younger of the diarchs of the nation you are in.”</p><p class="double">“Luna,” Leah repeated. “Well, you know who I am... so, why?”</p><p class="double">Luna pursed her lips – an interesting sight, on a horse. “We are familiar with the world you are from. Frankly, we feel sorry for you.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t need pity.” Leah&#039;s response was instant.</p><p class="double">“An admirable trait... but only if not taken too far.” Luna shook her head. “It is not pity, so much as...” she paused. “I have no personal experience with your world. But from what I have been told, that you are still sane is quite the accomplishment.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not convincing me,” Leah said, frowning. “Sorry, but...”</p><p class="double">Luna clamped down on what she was about to say, and mulled over her words for some time. Finally, she began again. “Please, consider it. Though I would not presume to bribe you, nor to offer you coercion, I think it would be good for you. And...” another silence. “One of our number, one of the younger loopers, has experience with how to construct a mental shield. One which remains operative no matter your form.”</p><p class="double">Leah tried to damp the incredible spike of relief which those words woke, remembering all the other times things had gone wrong. “That&#039;s a powerful incentive.”</p><p class="double">Silence returned, stretching for several more minutes.</p><p class="double">“Where would I find you?” Leah eventually asked.</p><p class="double">Luna sighed with relief. “In the town you were in earlier this day, there is a tree with a house built into it just off the main square. Two of us may be found within... along with a selection of library books.”</p><p class="double">The werewolf surprised herself with a chuckle. “Okay. I&#039;m not promising anything, but...”</p><p class="double">Luna bowed, then smiled. “Confine when you go to sleep to the hours of darkness, and I will do all I can to keep you from nightmares. That is a gift.”</p><p class="double">With that, she slowly faded from view.</p><p class="double">Now alone in the dream-scape, Leah shifted back into a wolf.</p><p class="double">Then she lay with her muzzle on her paws, and cried.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac walked into the Books and Branches, carrying a satchel of books on each flank. “Afternoon, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Hello, Mac,” Twilight replied with a smile. “Harvest done?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Mac started unloading the books – mostly reference books about alchemy, along with something about liquid rocket fuel. “AJ got lazy and did &#039;em with telekinesis. Thanks fer th&#039; loans.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s no trouble.” Twilight shrugged. “What were you doing with them, by the way?”</p><p class="double">“Tryin&#039; to come up with somethin&#039; potent enough fer a dragon.” Mac shook his head. “No go so far.”</p><p class="double">Twilight picked up the rocket fuel book and opened it at the first reference tab. “This is about hydrazine.”</p><p class="double">“Spike didn&#039;t even burp.” Mac chuckled. “One o&#039; these days ah&#039;m gonna invent a tumbler material that can handle Chlorine Triflouride. <i>That</i> should do it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced.</p><p class="double">The bell jangled as she flipped through Mac&#039;s notes. “Come in.”</p><p class="double">“Is this a bad time?”</p><p class="double">She looked up, and saw it was a somewhat-familiar blue mare. Leah.</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s fine. Mac knows.” Twilight flared her horn, flipping the door sign to closed. “Okay, let&#039;s get this sorted out.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How much do you know about the loops?” Twilight asked, offering Leah her choice of benches in the underground lecture room.</p><p class="double">(She had an underground lecture room this loop. Trixie had insisted on a suitably elaborate underground base.)</p><p class="double">“Not much,” Leah admitted. “I know I&#039;m – I was – stuck in some kind of sick Groundhog day thing, but years long.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight nodded, levitating a thin wooden stick and clicking to the first slide. “The Time Loops started when the computer that basically underlies all reality – Yggdrasil – got badly damaged. The Loops are a kind of fail-safe mode, which is how reality is being preserved as it&#039;s worked on and fixed.”</p><p class="double">She clicked to a second slide. “At first, just five worlds started looping, and the rest were static. Time passed, and the area being stabilized expanded – resulting in more looping worlds. We&#039;re in my home world, Equestria, several steps down the line. Yours is at least six more, but we haven&#039;t done a precise count – the idea of &#039;at the same time&#039; kind of blurs in this situation.”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused. “Oh, feel free to stop me if you have any questions.”</p><p class="double">Leah just nodded.</p><p class="double">“Now, each looping world has what&#039;s called an Anchor. They&#039;re the person who keeps it stable. Other people loop, but the Anchor is the one who always does – others may or may not.”</p><p class="double">“Does that mean that I&#039;m one of these Anchors, then?” Leah asked.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m almost certain you are,” Twilight replied. “I&#039;d be surprised if you weren&#039;t. Now, the reason you&#039;re in my world is what&#039;s called a fused loop. These are a bit more complicated...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After the lecture was over, Leah remained silent for a few minutes.</p><p class="double">“I see,” she said eventually. “So... does that mean the reason I can&#039;t have children...”</p><p class="double">“It might be partly due to your phasing,” Twilight hedged, “but no looper can have children anyway unless they did the first time around, as I understand it.”</p><p class="double">“Good to know I&#039;m not <i>that</i> much of a freak...” Leah muttered to herself. “Right. Okay. Just one question – how do you all know so much about me?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s... one of the stranger things,” Twilight said, picking up a set of books on a sideboard with her magic. “Every world we&#039;ve ever discovered in the loops, bar one, is like a version of some fictional material from another world. Yours isn&#039;t the lone exception.”</p><p class="double">She deposited the books in front of Leah.</p><p class="double">“Sorry to say, they&#039;re mostly from Bella&#039;s point of view.”</p><p class="double">Leah picked the first one up. “Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Twilight said, then winced. “Oh, that&#039;s going to happen a lot this loop...”</p><p class="double">“Wait, your name&#039;s Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle. Sorry I didn&#039;t introduce myself before...”</p><p class="double">Leah blinked, then burst out laughing. It was a slightly hysterical, desperate laugh in character – but it <i>was</i> laughter.</p><p class="double">“Oh, my sides...” she said, panting, as the fit wound down. “That&#039;s <i>bad</i>.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not usually a walking pun!” Twilight protested. “Just when this universe comes up.”</p><p class="double">“Mine, you mean.” Calming down, Leah opened the first book. “Ew... sparkly vampire.”</p><p class="double">She looked up. “Edward&#039;s a lot scarier than this in reality, though.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded soberly. “I can barely imagine. I&#039;ve actually been to your world, once, though I was actually in Bella&#039;s place – I don&#039;t think your world had started looping yet. I neutralized the Cullen&#039;s magic and had them arrested.”</p><p class="double">Leah&#039;s jaw dropped. “That&#039;s... that&#039;s perfect. That&#039;s the best revenge I could have come up with!”</p><p class="double">The unicorn shrugged, embarrassed. “I don&#039;t like killing.”</p><p class="double">“Neither do I,” Leah said, then shrugged. The gesture carried a deep weariness. “Not like I have much choice sometimes, though.”</p><p class="double">The silence stretched out after that.</p><p class="double">After a few minutes, they heard the library bell tinkle again.</p><p class="double">“That must be the others. I&#039;ll go tell them where we are.” Twilight stepped to the door, then paused. “If you want to, you can read those books to get some sense of how your world works from the point of view of Bella. I won&#039;t force you, though.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Leah nodded.</p><p class="double">“And – I want to make one thing clear, Leah. If we&#039;re making you uncomfortable, say so and we&#039;ll stop. If you want to go, we&#039;ll let you. We won&#039;t force you to do or think anything, and we&#039;ll make clear <i>what</i> we can do so you can make a judgement call.”</p><p class="double">For a moment, Twilight&#039;s eyes seemed to harden. “Equestria is a safe loop. And that&#039;s one thing we all know you need.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight waited until the others were seated, then sat down herself.</p><p class="double">“Everything going all right?”</p><p class="double">“Fine,” Spike replied.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara and Fluttershy nodded their agreement.</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s more of us than this,” Twilight added to Leah, “but these three are probably the ones you&#039;ll get the most help from first. Okay, guys, full disclosure.”</p><p class="double">Tiara spoke first. “My name is Diamond Tiara. I am a P-2 telepath and telempath thanks to a rather strange fused loop, though I&#039;m deliberately not trying to receive right now. I&#039;m trained in how to teach others to shield.”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded. “Yeah, that&#039;s going to be immensely helpful. That jerk Edward...”</p><p class="double">“And the pack,” Twilight added gently. “Shielding works both ways – project and receive.”</p><p class="double">The visiting anchor looked down for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was slightly raw. “Keep going.”</p><p class="double">Spike cleared his throat. “I&#039;m Spykoranuvellitar – I usually go by Spike. I&#039;m a dragon, and since one of <i>my</i> first fused loops was in the Star Wars world, I&#039;m basically a Jedi. That makes me a receiving empath by default, though again I&#039;m maintaining your privacy as far as I can.”</p><p class="double">Leah shook her head. “This is just...”</p><p class="double">“Overwhelming?” Twilight suggested. “I&#039;ve had that myself. We actually corresponded with the team who were our own sort-of creators once.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d like to give mine a punch to the jaw,” Leah said <i>sotto voce.</i> “What about you?”</p><p class="double">“Um... I&#039;m Fluttershy. I specialize in animals and vetinary work, and I&#039;m... sort of a shapeshifter.”</p><p class="double">“Huh. Well, fair enough.” Leah looked around. “What about... Luna, was it?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s asleep right now, I think,” Twilight said, checking the time. “She said she was helping you have dreamless sleeps.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. I&#039;d... like to thank her, if I can.”</p><p class="double">“Shouldn&#039;t be a problem,” Twilight said confidently. “Our loops tend to last several years, you&#039;ll have the time. Now, I&#039;d guess that you&#039;d like to learn from Tiara first. Is that correct?”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded. “Yes. I&#039;d... <i>really</i> appreciate being able to keep my thoughts mine.”</p><p class="double">Spike stood up. “Okay. D.T, do you want me as the other side?”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good.” Diamond Tiara stood as well, and frowned. “Wait, where&#039;s the side rooms in this place? I lost track of the corridors, I&#039;ve never been down here.”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ve never <i>had</i> this before,” Twilight replied. “Trixie built it. I&#039;ll show you the route.”</p><p class="double">“Right, gotcha. Suppose we&#039;re lucky she didn&#039;t build a space station...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, not bad. Now, try and hold it for a few minutes.” Tiara looked across at Spike and nodded.</p><p class="double">Spike reached out a hand, closed his eyes, and focused.</p><p class="double">There were a few seconds of silence, then Leah winced. “Ow. Who did that?”</p><p class="double">“That was me,” Spike admitted. “Tiara wanted me to test if you could pick up an attempt to read you. Looks like you can.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s something...” Leah rubbed her forehead with a hoof. “I&#039;m guessing you still got <i>in</i>, though?”</p><p class="double">“No, actually,” Spike said. “The shield held until you started talking. You&#039;re doing fine.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s been a week...” Leah said. “I know you have school and stuff, Tiara, but I feel like this is taking forever.”</p><p class="double">The filly thought about it. “Actually, taking into account all the meditation I&#039;ve been getting you to do when I&#039;m at school or at home, you&#039;re about average.”</p><p class="double">She made a face. “I know Bella takes, what, three hours to get her magical anti-mind-reading shield to cover an entire platoon&#039;s worth of people, but that&#039;s <i>not</i> normal. Hay, I&#039;ve got an advantage at this sub-field, and it took me ages to manage a group shield.”</p><p class="double">“Advantage?” Leah asked, trying to form a shield again.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve seen my cutie mark?” Leah nodded, and Tiara went on. “Well, one of the things we&#039;ve noticed in the loops is that they have a <i>lot</i> of interpretations. Mine&#039;s got a diamond in it, so... hard shields is the aspect of psionics I&#039;m especially good at.”</p><p class="double">Spike chuckled. “That and being a diamond-hard hard-assed b-”</p><p class="double">“Aren&#039;t Jedi supposed to be above name-calling?” Diamond Tiara asked archly.</p><p class="double">“Not that I&#039;m aware of!” Spike replied cheerfully.</p><p class="double">Leah chuckled, still concentrating.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sorry, guys,” Tiara said, getting up. “I&#039;ve got to head home now. Dad gets upset if I&#039;m out too late.”</p><p class="double">“That, right there.” Leah shook her head. “It&#039;s so... strange, I suppose. I mean, I&#039;ve been through hundreds of years and all that, but... it&#039;s strange to think of a kid doing that.” A shadow passed across her face. “Apart from that half-vampire one from my home.”</p><p class="double">“You think it&#039;s strange to think about?” Tiara asked. “Try living it. I&#039;ve been in charge of armies before, and now I&#039;ve got a bed time...”</p><p class="double">“Is that common?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m about Tiara&#039;s age, in one sense.” Spike shrugged. “But dragons can grow with strong enough emotion, and Twilight and I reverse-engineered it so I can basically change physical age at will.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;s about how everyone reacts.” Spike opened the door for Tiara to leave, then glanced back at Leah. “Should I get Fluttershy to come down?”</p><p class="double">“Sure, go ahead.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, what helps me is that... I don&#039;t think of it as being &#039;me and the wolf&#039;...” Fluttershy paused. “Or me and the panther, or me and the budgie, or... well, any animal – they&#039;re just me. I&#039;m sort of comfortable-ish in a lot of forms, but that&#039;s because of practise.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know what you mean in one way.” Leah lay back against the wall. “But... well, every time I see Imprinting, every time I get given an order by an Alpha, it frightens me. My wolf side has instincts – powerful ones – that it feels like could take over at any time. Stop me from being <i>me.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Fluttershy nodded. “Okay, let&#039;s have a look at this from a different direction. Could you transform for me, please?”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded, and erupted outwards into her lupine form. At a gesture, she padded out to the centre of the room.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy walked around her, muttering under her breath and occasionally casting a small spell.</p><p class="double">“I think I see,” she said, a few minutes later. “You&#039;re not quite a natural wolf – but we already knew that. The unusual thing about it seems to be linked to how you got the form in the first place... and yes, your instincts <i>are</i> misfiring. They&#039;re originally from a <i>male</i> wolf, and the conversion to female didn&#039;t go quite right. I think we can sort it out with a few weeks&#039; time.”</p><p class="double">Leah shifted back to pony. “Will that last?”</p><p class="double">“It should do. They&#039;re already trying to snap into the right shape, they just don&#039;t know what the right shape <i>is</i>... for an unusual interpretation of &#039;know&#039;, of course.”</p><p class="double">“Okay. Thanks.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s no trouble at all,” Fluttershy insisted. “Though I&#039;d like to get my hooves on the shamans who cast this spell. I&#039;d... give them a big telling off.”</p><p class="double">Leah laughed.</p><p class="double">“As for the two things you mentioned – neither of them is natural. They&#039;re like... some stupid <i>idea</i> of how wolves actually work.” Fluttershy frowned momentarily. “Wolves mate for life, but they don&#039;t instantly lock onto a mate. That&#039;s... silly. And if a wolf doesn&#039;t want to listen to the pack alphas, they just leave.”</p><p class="double">“You seem pretty angry about it,” Leah ventured.</p><p class="double">“I <i>am</i>. Well,” the pegasus backpedalled, blushing. “Cross. I&#039;m cross, because wolves don&#039;t behave like that and because all these changes do is hurt people. They&#039;re almost like curses.”</p><p class="double">“Now that I <i>can</i> believe.”</p><p class="double">“Though...” Fluttershy paced in a circle. “No, I can&#039;t be sure enough. I&#039;ll let you know if I get anything.”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded. “Sure. Now, what&#039;s for lunch?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy rummaged in a set of saddlebags. “Here we are. Watercress sandwiches.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sorry I&#039;m late,” Spike said, pushing the door open. “I had to help Twilight and the others with the Nightmare Night preparations.”</p><p class="double">Tiara nodded, and gestured to Spike&#039;s seat. As he sat down, she gave him a meaningful look and then pointed at Leah.</p><p class="double">He closed his eyes, and reached out with the Force. Gently at first, then with more and more power behind it.</p><p class="double">“Well?” Tiara asked some minutes later, when he sat back.</p><p class="double">“Couldn&#039;t get anything. In or out. You?”</p><p class="double">“Me neither.” Diamond Tiara grinned. “Well done, Leah. That shield should hold up against anything, so long as you can hold it.”</p><p class="double">Leah looked at them, still holding the shield. “What&#039;s next?”</p><p class="double">“Next, we make sure you can hold it when you&#039;re under stress.” Tiara tapped a hoof on the floor. “I was going to ask how we stress-test her, but the answer&#039;s simple. Trixie.”</p><p class="double">“...yeah, that&#039;ll work if anything will,” Spike agreed. “I&#039;ll let her know.”</p><p class="double">“Still, she deserves a week or so off,” Tiara mused. “What about Nightmare Night itself?”</p><p class="double">“Which is?”</p><p class="double">“I think the earth equivalent is an American-style Halloween. Lots of costumes, that sort of thing – and trick-or-treating.” Spike grinned. “I&#039;m going as Captain America!”</p><p class="double">Leah blinked. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Because it is <i>hilarious</i> to watch everypony trying to work out what the costume is,” Spike answered. “Want to join us? I&#039;m going around with Tiara, her friend Silver and the Crusaders, because they need someone to look after them.”</p><p class="double">“I could kill you with my <i>mind</i>,” Tiara said blandly.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but then Rarity would avenge me.” Spike shrugged. “How about it?”</p><p class="double">“So I&#039;d just, what, phase to wolf and spend the evening getting candy?” They nodded. “Sure.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s see...” Fluttershy said, pacing in a circle around Leah just outside a thin circle of wolf fur. “I think that&#039;s everything...”</p><p class="double">She looked at Leah. “If you want to back out of this, then now is the time. It will be... painful.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m ready,” Leah said promptly. “Do it.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus nodded, then erupted with light.</p><p class="double">Leah clamped down on her instinctive reaction to flinch, and forced herself to keep looking.</p><p class="double">When the light died down, there was a glittering necklace hanging from Fluttershy&#039;s neck – and she was an alicorn.</p><p class="double">Silently, her horn began to glow.</p><p class="double">The yellow fingers of magic spread out to fill the room, then concentrated into the fur circle. It took on a golden lustre, rose into the air-</p><p class="double">Pain lanced through Leah. Unbidden, she phased to wolf, and the magic jumped across from the fur to her.</p><p class="double">Foreign thoughts invaded her mind. Simple thoughts – the behaviour of a normal wolf. There was some sapience there, some ability to reason – some language – but not much.</p><p class="double">Then her own, old instincts awoke, rising from the depths of her mind to take over.</p><p class="double">She screamed as the two sets of instructions clashed, with a sensation like fire running down her spine and up through her head. Her personality – what made her <i>her</i> – was shunted aside, only able to observe. And hurt.</p><p class="double">For a moment, she seemed to be entirely <i>outside</i> her own body, looking down on it as it flailed in agony. Then everything went black.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you alright?” Fluttershy&#039;s voice woke her.</p><p class="double">Leah opened her eyes, and wished she hadn&#039;t. A migrane stabbed her in both eyes, and she closed them again with a yelp.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear...” Fluttershy said sadly. “Hold on, try this.”</p><p class="double">Soothing warmth spread through her. “There.”</p><p class="double">This time, opening her eyes just got her a headache. She tried to stand, and fell over when her paws didn&#039;t want to work properly.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry. You&#039;ll be fine in a minute.” Fluttershy&#039;s next sentence sounded apologetic. “I had to sort-of rebuild your instincts from the ground up, so they&#039;re still calibrating.”</p><p class="double">“Ow...” Leah muttered... then blinked. “Dihd aye jussst-”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy eeped. “Oops. I think this means you got the optional extra...”</p><p class="double">Shaking her head, Leah tried again. This time, it came out a little closer to intelligible. “How cahn I tallk?”</p><p class="double">“I might have made a mistake,” Fluttershy admitted. “I&#039;ve had to cast Origin of Species a few times before, but usually speech is just part of what goes into it. I think I included it out of habit.”</p><p class="double">“Well... no harm done, I suppose,” Leah said, feeling her jaw. “<i>Man</i>, but that&#039;s going to confuse the rest of the Pack.”</p><p class="double">She sniffed the air.</p><p class="double">“Oh, you must be hungry.” Fluttershy trotted over to the door, left for a minute, and came back in as Leah was trying to stand up again. Something big dragged on the floor behind her. “Here. It&#039;s venison.”</p><p class="double">“Are... you okay with that kind of thing? Hunting?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shrugged. “I fill up half my subspace pocket with ethically sourced meat whenever I get a chance, because – yes, animals here do tend to sapience. But this is fine. Roast, actually.”</p><p class="double">Leah needed no further instructions.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, so... how long did that take?” Leah asked, still slightly startled by how <i>much</i> food she&#039;d put away.</p><p class="double">“The magic?” Fluttershy checked. At Leah&#039;s nod, she went on. “Three days.”</p><p class="double">“...okay, wow.”</p><p class="double">“Epic-grade magic is like that.” Fluttershy shrugged. “I can&#039;t cast it very often, either, it drains me in ways which are permanent. But-” she held up a hoof, forestalling what Leah was about to say. “I don&#039;t mind.”</p><p class="double">“Well... thanks.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled.</p><p class="double">“Seriously,” Leah went on. “You guys have been great to me. I was a wreck when I got here, and...”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry about it.” Fluttershy stood. “Now, you still need to finish recalibrating your instincts... want to go for a run?”</p><p class="double">Leah stood, finding it much easier than even ten minutes ago. “Sure.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Two shapes, one larger than the other, loped through the uncertain light beneath the boughs.</p><p class="double">The smaller one changed course, bounding off a tree trunk to turn, and the larger one threw up divots of earth as she matched it.</p><p class="double">They emerged into a clearing where a tree had recently fallen, and the smaller one gathered herself before leaping at a startled bear. The impact bowled the bear over entirely, and the smaller wolf licked his throat before jumping off.</p><p class="double">“So...” the larger wolf said, amused. “Counting coup?”</p><p class="double">The smaller one nodded, with a trace of embarrassment. The bear, meanwhile, headed home in confusion.</p><p class="double">“Anywhere I can give that a go?”</p><p class="double">The smaller wolf nodded again and turned, tossing her head to tell the larger one to follow.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, this is it, huh?” Leah said.</p><p class="double">“Pretty much,” Twilight replied. “Our loop normally ends tonight.”</p><p class="double">“Well, in case I don&#039;t get another chance... thanks, all of you.” Leah smiled. “You&#039;ve been lovely.”</p><p class="double">The various loopers of Equestria shuffled, embarrassed.</p><p class="double">Leah looked again at the small bracelet she&#039;d been given. Well over a dozen silver charms dangled off it, most of them styled for cutie marks of those she&#039;d met here. (The rest were a little more allegorical – Spike, for example, was represented by a silver flame.)</p><p class="double">Then she dropped it into her new subspace pocket, where it wouldn&#039;t get lost. She could only keep one thing in it at the moment, but – well, one was enough.</p><p class="double">“How are you going to spend the last evening?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Leah shrugged. “Not got a particular plan, really. Why?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Good. Pinkie?”</p><p class="double">Then a hundred party poppers detonated at once.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Leah&#039;s eyes opened, showing her the ceiling of her room.</p><p class="double">Her room at La Push.</p><p class="double">For a moment, she wondered if it was a dream – then she concentrated, and the bracelet appeared in a little flicker of light.</p><p class="double">She smiled happily, then put it away again. <i>Not a dream.</i></p><p class="double">Standing up, she contemplated exactly how to do things this time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the three new vampires emerged from the treeline, they arrayed themselves so that one of the males was in front of the others. Clearly, Bella reasoned, he must be the leader.</p><p class="double">And their eyes... were red. Sinister red.</p><p class="double">Then something very large and silvery-grey shot past her, cannoned into the other male, and tore him apart.</p><p class="double">Bella could hear Alice&#039;s exclamation of surprise, and tried to work out what that could mean. Could it be that Alice hadn&#039;t seen this?</p><p class="double">Beside her, Edward muttered something about being unable to &#039;read&#039; the newcomer.</p><p class="double">While that had been going on, the enormous thing – creature – wolf turned whiplash-fast and pounced on the female vampire.</p><p class="double">Glittering venom and chunks of vampire went flying.</p><p class="double">Several crowded seconds later, and all that was left of the newcomers was debris.</p><p class="double">Then the wolf snorted in satisfaction, and... flowed into the form of a young adult woman. Wearing nothing at all.</p><p class="double">Bella gasped. Esme put her hand over Edward&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” the woman shouted – by her features, she was one of the Quilettes. A werewolf? “Can one of you burn these tossers? I don&#039;t have a lighter.”</p><p class="double">With that, she blurred again, and loped off.</p><p class="double">Bella could swear she was laughing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='41'></a><h3>Loops 39</h3>
<p>39.1 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Albus Dumbledore sat in his office, staring straight and unfocused at nothing in particular. If there was one thing he hated about getting older, it was how the perception of time changed. To those children in their beds, three months would seem like forever and a day. But for someone who had as much clutter in his mind as he did, three months can pass by almost in an eye-blink.</p><p class="double">So when everything changed in a perceived eye-blink, Albus was caught completely off guard. </p><p class="double">It was supposed to be an exciting year. Harry Potter was starting Hogwarts, as well as some of the prominent wizarding family&#039;s children. He should have expected something was wrong when Flitwick described the American-raised girl as &#039;lively&#039; and &#039;energetic&#039;. Dumbledore should have remembered that the charms professor, who gets so overexcited by the most trivial of reasons that he tends to fall out of his chair on a regular basis, and whose hyperactivity served him very well on the duelling circuit, usually sees most people as plodding and slow. Anyone he calls &#039;exciting&#039; should have instantly sent up a red flag of warning.</p><p class="double">Instead, the first sign that this would be a most unusual year came during the school song. Instead of a mismatched collection of young voices, there came a song and dance number that Albus would have been sure was carefully choreographed had he not been caught up in the spell, himself. New children sang about being excited to learn magic, but also a little bit scared. Older kids sang about how hard they would have to study for their tests. Professors Snape and McGonagall sang a very lovely duet. Dumbledore, himself, felt the pressure on his occlumency shields but gave in when he noticed that the compulsion to sing was harmless. </p><p class="double">After speaking with the girl he believed to be responsible for the entertaining song and dance, McGonagall relayed that such a thing had happened before in Miss Pie&#039;s presence. She had called it a &#039;Heart&#039;s song&#039;. Apparently, the girl was a natural auralmancer. It wasn&#039;t without precedence; and like the others, the light reddish-haired girl seemed destined for the stage and a life of harmless entertainment. </p><p class="double">And then came the problems. Miss Pie&#039;s magic was, in a word, odd. Especially if she had to cast a spell over any sort of distance. An imperfect analogy was that casting a spell successfully was like throwing a ball at a target. However, Miss Pie&#039;s spells came out with far too much force and on a completely random trajectory every time. It didn&#039;t matter how she pointed her wand, there was no predicting what would happen.</p><p class="double">And then came potions class. After a cursory surface scan during the first dinner, Albus noted that Miss Pie&#039;s mental defences resembled the outer surface of an over-inflated balloon. He decided it was a curious aspect that was due to her auralmancy and left it at that. If he had been thinking properly, he would have warned Severus. Mental backlash was usually a result of practising legilimancy on a mundane animal. The human&#039;s mind worked on a much higher and faster level, and connecting it in any significant way resulted with the animal&#039;s mind torn asunder and the poor beast in a drooling coma. That it had happened to an accomplished legilimancer like Snape made Dumbledore only speculate at what breakneck speed the odd little girl&#039;s mind worked. </p><p class="double">It also made Dumbledore take over the potion-master&#039;s classes for the rest of the year to the cheers of a great many students.</p><p class="double">The first flight training lesson resulted in Mr. Longbottom with a sprained wrist and dislocated shoulder when Miss Pie caught him inches from the ground. The rest of the unsupervised class was taken up with Harry Potter getting a spot on the Griffindor quidditch team by saving Neville&#039;s remembrall from smashing on the ground while Miss Pie laughed wildly as she spun as fast as she could around all three axes – as though her broom was some sort of a gyroscopic carnival ride. Of course after fifteen uninterrupted minutes of crazy spinning, she carefully landed on the ground, took a few steps, and promptly threw up all over Mr. Malfoy before passing out on the grass. Had he had not seen it himself from his window, Albus would have never believed such a little girl could have eaten so much. </p><p class="double">Then there was the party for the house elves, the party for her housemates, the party for the first month anniversary of starting magic school, the party celebrating Professor Binn&#039;s new permanent retirement, and so forth. Oh, and the party for the Troll. Can&#039;t forget that one. Of course, using legilimancy and seeing Professor Quirrel casting an imperius and leading said troll into the school on Voldemort&#039;s spirit&#039;s orders had said spirit angrily and violently detaching and fleeing the school. That resulted in the second professor to be placed in Saint Mungo&#039;s hospital in a bed right next to Severus. </p><p class="double">A few weeks later, they had found Lockhart gibbering to himself in the Forbidden Forest. He was completely covered in medium, large, and extra large sized acromantula. Lady acromantula, Hagrid said – and Albus really, really didn&#039;t want to know how the gamekeeper knew of this fact. They had placed the replacement defence professor next to the Quirrel, the professor he replaced.</p><p class="double">Seeing as how the defence against the dark arts curse had gone into overdrive, Dumbledore couldn&#039;t coax anyone else to take the position. That was when the Ministry sent their choice to fill the vacancy. Albus and the other professors had a bet going of how long she would last. It looked like Trelawney, amazingly, would win the hundred galleons for her predictably dire prediction of less than one day. </p><p class="double">But the worst thing, the worst thing was – that after Miss Pie had been questioned and set free about her perspective of the tragic case of accidental magic gone wrong, Albus habitually reached into his bowl of lemon drops only to find that they – were – all – GONE!</p><p class="double">So now, all Albus Dumbledore could do was stare blankly at the wall and count the hours until he could race out to muggle London to get more.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;All I&#039;m saying is that Quodpod makes Quidditch look like a bunch of old ladies having a picnic,&quot; Twilight heard Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice before she and Applejack entered her room. They were the last two of her friends to arrive.</p><p class="double">&quot;Quodpod is half football – American Footbal – half baseball, half hot potato, and half storming the beach at Normandy. How many explosions does Quidditch have in one game? Zero. It&#039;s all about prancing around on your broom and trying to catch a tiny artificial bird. Thus, it&#039;s so boooring,&quot; Dash continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;Four halves?&quot; Twilight spoke up. &quot;Shouldn&#039;t it be four quarters?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quarters? I&#039;m surprised an egghead like you didn&#039;t know that Quodpod doesn&#039;t have quarters. Quodpod only has three innings, like hockey.&quot;</p><p class="double">Exasperated explanation on her lips, Twilight looked up into the grinning, teasing face of her athletic friend. &quot;Alright, you got me. Now, are you ready for Pinkie&#039;s letter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is anyone ever really ready for Pinkie&#039;s anything?&quot; Rarity spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well..,&quot; whatever Twilight started to say was lost as space folded into itself before unfolding to reveal Gummy. The small alligator was serenely and impossibly floating in midair. He slowly turned to face the girls, opened his toothless mouth, and made a noise like a foghorn. Then he vanished with a pop, leaving behind only a pink envelope.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know,&quot; Twilight preempted everyone&#039;s questions, &quot;And I don&#039;t really want to know. Now let&#039;s see how much sanity is still left in the UK.&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender-haired girl unfolded the letter and started to read. </p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, faraway friends! It feels like it&#039;s been a month since I&#039;ve last written to you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It has been a month,&quot; Applejack interjected.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and continued, &quot;But so much has happened, I don&#039;t know where to start. How about at the end of the last letter? That&#039;s a good place, right? Well, I may have gotten a little ahead of myself when I said I wanted to be Dolores&#039;s new bestest friend. That was before she gave me.... the book.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was like all the worst parts of all the worst books in the world were stuck together with worst glue and bound in horrible, horrible awful boring boringness. And Dolores wanted me to read it. The whole thing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I tried to. I really did. I got to the second page before I closed it and raised my hand. When no one called on me, I started waving it around as though I just didn&#039;t care – but secretly, I did care. Finally, when I raised my second hand and was about to do a puppet-less finger puppet show (and I think Lyra was right. Fingers are really, really neat!), Dolores – or Professor Dolly as I decided to call her, finally asked me what I wanted.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I told her that my awful book was so overfull of boring that it exploded. To which she replied that my book was perfectly fine and on my desk, so of course I told her that my watch was fast. She said I wasn&#039;t wearing a watch, but I couldn&#039;t say anything else as my book rose into the air and exploded into confetti. At first, I was worried at what Hermione would say about a destroyed book, but then I realized that I was replacing Hermione! Her name sounds like Harmony and that kind of rhymes with Pinkie. I should see if I could make a song out of that. Oh right, back to what happened in class.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I told a speechless Professor Dolly that it was okay and I forgive her for making me buy such a horrible textbook. It gone and can&#039;t hurt my brain any more, now. Then for some mysterious reason, she turned an angry shade of purple and gave me a detention. I think she wanted some private time so she could apologize in private.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Instead, she gave me a quill pen and told me to start writing &#039;I will not be annoying&#039;. It was good advice. No one likes someone who is being annoying at a party. But when I started writing, the pen hurt my hand. Professor Dolly asked if there was something wrong, but I said don&#039;t worry about it, I can fix it. And then I channeled my magic really hard to fix the pen and make it scratchy write somewhere else than on the back of my hand.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The people at that Saint Mango hospital said some horrible person etched the words &#039;I will not be annoying&#039; into Professor Dolly&#039;s brain, and that she can&#039;t teach anymore or remember how to walk on two legs or use a bathroom. But I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll fix her all up in no time. At least she has a bed near Locky Heart, Squi-rel, and Spooky Snapey, so she won&#039;t be sad and lonely. I&#039;m also fairly sure she would have wanted me to have all her moving kitten plates as an apology for that book, so now I have a lot of moving kitten plates. I decorated them all along the walls of Big Blinky&#039;s home. Both BB and Hedwig enjoy the how the kitties pretend to be scared whenever they see a giant legless lizard monster and a hungry owl.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy made a small squeaky noise that sounded very much like, &quot;Oh those poor plate kitties.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, unfazed, just continued with the letter, &quot;Speaking of those two, you may have noticed that Hedwig didn&#039;t come and deliver the letter along with gummy. Well, that naughty bird and her friend got into my polyjuice potion stockpile. Apparently, they&#039;re married now and expecting three.. I don&#039;t know. Coatl? Snakey-owl babies that will probably have wings and claws and invisible death-beam laser eyes? I figure after Pound and Pumpkin, it would be a restful relaxing vacation to baby-sit (coatl-sit?) these three once they hatch.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Speaking of polyjuice, I showed Mr. Beaky – who used to be the giant squid in the lake here, to Ron. But even though he lost his rat, Ron didn&#039;t really want Mr. Beaky as his new pet. I don&#039;t know why. I think Mr. Beaky turned out great. I fed him polyjuice with tiny bits of every kind of magical animal I could find. Each change made him look more and more interesting. I thought he would be a great pet for someone who didn&#039;t care for a small and somewhat uninteresting rat. But on the other hand, Ron is now no longer scared of spiders.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not much else is going on. Someone threw my friend, Harry Potter, a magic teleporting rock that hit him in the head and made him take an unscheduled field trip to a real live cemetery. He said that old Moldy Voldie was behind the whole thing, and that he managed to return by grabbing the teleporting rock after old Moldy got a new body; but no one believes him except for Ron and Neville and me and Big Al Dumbledore. I should really prepare a fun &#039;Hooray on Becoming Corporeal Again&#039; party for when old Moldy visits the castle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re doing defence by independent study and I&#039;m learning so much! I got force push down pat and almost got force lightning to go where I want it to. I also got this screaming book at the library, and while it distracted the librarian; I grabbed a whole bunch of books on runes and enchanting. I thought about baking another Pretty Party Candy-copter again, but decided instead to figure out how brooms work and made all these for you girls! Just treat this letter like a storage scroll and enjoy your gifts from this Holly Jolly Pinkie. And come on over in exactly one month from now. If my Pinkie sense is right – and it usually is, there will be a party and cupcakes and a castle invasion and balloons and streamers and everything! This is Magical Girl Candy Enchantress Pinkie Pie, signing out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and sent a small amount of chakra into the letter. Five festively wrapped boxes popped out, each with an easily identified cutie mark for the intended girl.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now be careful,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I&#039;m sure whatever Pinkie sent us is..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, I don&#039;t care what anyone said or what I had privately thought about you before!&quot; enthusiastically interrupted Rainbow Dash. The girl was wearing light blue arm and leg warmers, each with her old cutie mark on them. She was also gleefully floating near the ceiling, &quot;Pinkie Pie, you are now best human!&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Rainbow Dash opened the window and happily rocketed out into the evening sky. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">39.2 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">(X-Communication)</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Doctor Vahlen slapped the after action report on the table in front of her. &quot;How could this debacle occur? What sort of idiots are you letting into your strike teams these days!&quot;</p><p class="double">She alone of the three around the conference table had an armed guard, at her own insistence against some delayed action mind-control effect left during her mind to mind contact with Sparkle. She&#039;d already put herself through every form of mental scanning and test known to X-Com short of going in the containment chamber herself, and the results had been uniformly negative. Apart from a slight dizziness and a taste of Elderberries in her mouth, the contact had left no physiological changes or mental alterations, other than converting her normal cool and dispassionate attitude towards her &#039;specimens&#039; to an icy hatred in Twilight&#039;s case.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t care for your tone, Doctor.&quot; Commander Benford said sternly. &quot;Every member of that team is a veteran of multiple missions. It is not their fault that the primary objective was able to escape. Her ability to teleport at will and long range perception abilities made her impossible to pin down, as the report states.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;It&#039; not her!&quot; Doctor Vahlen exclaimed. &quot;Applying a gender to an alien species is ridiculous. It isn&#039;t even humanoid! Despite any superficial similarities in vocal tone, it is a non-human monster, and anthromorphising it in that fashion may lead to confusion.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen, the head of Engineering, spoke up for the first time. &quot;Are we focussing too much on one thing? Other than capturing Sparkle the mission went well. No casualties on either the civilians or the team, 100% removal of the alien presence, even intact plasma rifles and pistols. It&#039;s even given us a lead on the location of the downed UFO they arrived in, which may yield more materiel. I&#039;m also a little worried about the mission goals, or rather their relative importance. Normally rescuing the civilians is our top priority.&quot;</p><p class="double">Benford shifted in his seat. &quot;I wasn&#039;t happy with it myself, but my orders came directly from the Council. When compared with the potential threat Sparkle offers, even protecting civilians had... reduced priority.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As it should have!&quot; Doctor Vahlen interjected. &quot;Mein Gott! You&#039;ve seen the footage! It took an entire alien terror attack to pieces by <i>itself</i>. And it&#039;s clear that it wasn&#039;t even showing it&#039;s full power! It has to be stopped whatever it takes!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shen sighed. &quot;And I think you and the council are missing one important fact. Is Sparkle a potential threat, possibly the greatest we&#039;ve faced? Absolutely! But the key word is potential. Look at <i>her</i> actions so far. She was captured, treated like a prisoner, no an experiment! The interviews with those people at the Hot Springs showed she was sure that the team sent there would have orders to kill her, not surprising if she was taking her cues from Doctor Vahlen.</p><p class="double">&quot;Turn it around, if you&#039;d been treated that way by her people and managed to escape, wouldn&#039;t you do whatever damage you could, take revenge once the balance of power was in your hands? I&#039;ve calculated the energy requirements some of those things she did would require, and I&#039;ve already worked out half a dozen ways she could have erased this entire facility. Stick a lump of iron in a force bubble with a vacuum and transmute it to anti-matter, then drop it in the middle of the base with the forcefield set to decay once you were safely away.</p><p class="double">&quot;If she does have Doctor Vahlen&#039;s knowledge she could have thought of that. And the team that went to get her? She could easily have destroyed them before they&#039;d even landed. That energy lance she displayed went through Sectopod armour as if it was tissue paper. Skyrangers are nowhere near as well armoured, and given her detection abilities, I have no doubt she could have registered on them from a kilometre away as easily as if she was standing on top of the wing. Or she could have done exactly what she did to those aliens.</p><p class="double">&quot;Instead when she left, the worst she did was make some smart remarks...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what about me!&quot; Vahlen snarled. &quot;She violated my mind, stole my memories!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Without harming anything other than your pride. She also saved your life, or do you think she needed to include you in her defences when the guards tried to terminate both of you? She&#039;s even apologised and offered to provide her memories in return. Just imagine it, knowledge of a whole different world with completely different technologies...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And so we come to it,&quot; Vahlen returned. &quot;You&#039;re letting your desire to find out about this creature cloud your judgement.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I think you&#039;re letting your fears see a threat where none exists, or at least won&#039;t unless we drive her into it. On the other hand, those same powers that make her dangerous could make her an invaluable ally. We know the Ethereals lived for millennia, and made plans on that scale. Do you think the loss of one capital ship, one invasion force, will stop them forever? Wouldn&#039;t it be good to have alien allies the next time we&#039;re attacked? She already proved she was willing and able to protect humans she&#039;d just met, those Japanese civilians think the world of her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When she was the one responsible for the attack in the first place, whether you believe it was unintentional or not.&quot; Vahlen&#039;s tone could have stripped paint, and made it quite clear what she believed. &quot;They should have been brought back here. I&#039;m sure more detailed debriefing would have demonstrated some evidence of mental tampering.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whereas I think the only form of mental tampering she demonstrated was politeness, honesty and a willingness to protect them. People tend to reciprocate when someone acts towards them a certain way. She acted as if she believed they would treat her as a person, and they did. She even insisted on paying her bill!&quot;</p><p class="double">Commander Benford finally decided to put an end to the wrangling. &quot;Now is not the time for discussing our strategy. We need more information. Speaking of which Doctor Vahlen, what is your analysis of the coins we recovered?&quot;</p><p class="double">With one last glower at Doctor Shen, the scientist pulled a set of notes up on a tablet computer. &quot;Firstly, they are almost pure gold, with just enough alloying metals to make them tough enough to stand wear, though there are some anomalies present. They weigh fractionally over a half troy ounce, and are about the size of a dime, but thicker. One side has the stylised &#039;face&#039; of a unicorn, profile on, possibly the Princess Celestia Sparkle mentioned or some other important person. The obverse has an equally stylised solar disk. There is lettering around the edge, presumably a value or legend. The edges are unmilled. The witnesses say she had a large bag of similar coins, maybe three decimetres in volume.&quot;</p><p class="double">Benford raised his eyebrows in shock. &quot;Wait, she claimed to be on a tight budget and yet she had...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Roughly 40 kilograms of near bullion quality gold as her pocket change. About one million US dollars. The unmilled edges also suggest that the issuing authority isn&#039;t worried about theft, which all point to the fact that gold is common on her world, far more common than on ours anyway. That could be explained by some of the impurities nuclear analysis threw up. There is almost no lead, but there are mercury isotopes and both lithium and beryllium present. By comparison, almost all gold deposits have lead as a major impurity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen caught on immediately. &quot;You believe it was transmuted from lead?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you explain that for those of us without a degree in nuclear physics or metallurgy, Doctor Vahlen?&quot; Commander Benford asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Doctor Shen is right.&quot; Vahlen didn&#039;t look happy at having to admit that. &quot; Lead has multiple stable isotopes, Gold has only one. Mercury is one of the end products of the decay of radioactive isotopes of gold, a side effect of imperfect transmutation. Transmutation would also release 3 protons and between 10 and 14 neutrons per nucleus. Those could be absorbed by forming lithium atoms, but only unstable isotopes which would further decay. Beryllium is an end product of some of those decay chains as well as stable isotopes of lithium.</p><p class="double">&quot;How they prevented themselves from dying of neutron exposure or targeted the reaction I don&#039;t know, but the composition is consistent with gold created through nuclear synthesis. Other isotope ratios confirm the gold isn&#039;t from any terrestrial gold deposit, or even one from the same accretion disk. The gold wasn&#039;t mined on any body in our solar system.</p><p class="double">&quot;This only increases her... it&#039;s hazard level, it not only has a superficially harmless appearance and a clear understanding of how to manipulate humans, but also money to sway the weak minded. Fortunately, even a million dollars won&#039;t buy that much safety, and most people will be less accommodating to an alien.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a knock, and a harried orderly came in with a sheaf of papers. Commander Benford skimmed them and sighed. &quot;Well she&#039;s trying something. Last night, sixty thousand dollars, or rather twenty in British pounds and twenty in Japanese yen were stolen from an international bank in downtown Tokyo, or rather taken, and a sum of gold coins worth a market value of sixty five was left in it&#039;s place, along with a letter accounting exactly what was taken and showing that the gold covered it including seigniorage.</p><p class="double">&quot;There were similar &#039;thefts&#039; at a business-wear store in the Ginza district of Tokyo, a pachinko parlour in Takayama, nearest town to the Okayama Hot Springs, a high end computer store in the Akihabara ward of Tokyo, a camping shop and several convenience stores. In each case money sufficient to cover the goods taken was left under a purple force field with a letter that itemised them and an instruction that the money would be released when they were rung up as sold, or in the case of the pachinko parlour, agreed to be replaced using the money.</p><p class="double">&quot;We still haven&#039;t been able to remove the records of the alien attack from the internet, too many off-line copies, and people in Japan at least are already starting to comment about the similarities. We&#039;ve managed to keep the official news channels from carrying it, but I don&#039;t know how long that will last. It&#039;s pernicious, it keeps reappearing no matter how much our techs remove it or try to &#039;out it&#039; as a CGI fake.&quot;</p><p class="double">He shook his head. &quot;But some of these items make no sense! Packaged long-life snacks and vegetarian food, obviously. Camping gear too. A high end laptop computer, okay, if Sparkle can figure out how to work it she could get a lot of information. But two female business suits? Black shoe polish? We know she can alter clothing to suit her form, but what does she expect to do, walk into an office somewhere and get a job?&quot;</p><p class="double">He shook his head. &quot;Until we have more information, all we can do is wait and see.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double">Dear Princess Celestia (and everypony else),</p><p class="double">I am alright! By now your forensic mages should have worked out roughly what happened, if not where I was sent to. My interstellar clairvoyance system went horribly right, due to the after effects of a recently dissipated quantum singularity in the target system. It caused a massive thaumic backlash that created a metaphasic planar inversion, obviously after the fact. I&#039;ve included the specifics in the form of arithmantic formulas which I have no doubt you, Princess Luna and a number of senior researchers at the university will find enlightening. For every-pony else, the basic idea that rather than bringing light from a distant star-system to me, the volume of space containing me was sent to the target star system should be easier to understand.</p><p class="double">I landed on a habitable world, inhabited by humans, right out of the old filly-tales. Well not quite, while their knowledge of magic is nearly non-existent, their non magical technology is in advance of ours in many ways, though it has some odd lacunae. For example, they invented steam engines before the germ theory of disease, despite having invented lenses centuries earlier, and that&#039;s just one of the oddities. Their world is far more heavily populated and industrialised than ours and there are no other intelligent races on the planet. Or weren&#039;t. They were recently attacked by an alien race from another star, and barely defeated them after much strife, even killing.</p><p class="double">This made my own position precarious, as they were predisposed to assume any non-human race was hostile. Hopefully I am working to change that point of view, but at this time, even if you manage to duplicate the interstellar teleportation effect, I would advise against sending any-pony else, even though this world needs help, not only to recover from the invasion, but from the damage that was being done by over-population, over-industrialisation and subsequent environmental damage. Without magic, recovering from that is far harder for them.</p><p class="double">As this letter proves, I have managed to develop a way to send back messages, and will continue to report back my progress. Recreating the full transportation effect will require more effort and alchemically produced materials that do not exist here, due to the lack of magical knowledge. However, I believe I can duplicate the magical processes needed, and supply the power required due to the other surprising development. I was placed under conditions of great stress in the aftermath of my arrival, and in the process something similar happened to me as to Princess Cadence.</p><p class="double">I was thinking of my friends, how I wanted to see them again, how I didn&#039;t want them to worry, how much they meant to me, and I felt a connection as if they were around me, supporting me. I believe that my link to the Elements of Harmony rather than the presence of Spectrum stone triggered my apotheosis into an alicorn. Suddenly some of the more puzzling aspects of the many tests you set for me make sense. You realised I had this potential, and did your best to develop it.</p><p class="double">I intend to use my newfound powers to help heal this world, to show them that unlike the invaders, pony-kind can offer a helping hoof rather than stomping them into the mud. I miss my friends and family terribly, and include a number of personal letters for them with this one. You should be able to target return letters given the arithmantic information I included, and I hope to hear from them. I will do my best to come home soon, but even with my expanded powers, developing the necessary materials will take time, and in the mean time, there is another world that needs the magic of friendship to recover from what&#039;s happened to it. Out of all the unicorns in the world you chose me as your protégée, and it is time once again to demonstrate your faith was not misplaced.</p><p class="double">Your faithful student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">James Bearing, Solicitor at Law and owner of Bearing Legal Associates prepared for his first meeting of the day. From the phone call yesterday this should prove to be interesting. The client, one Twilight Sparkle, was having difficulty establishing her legal identity and needed legal advice on how to resolve things. </p><p class="double">With a name like that, he could fill in the gaps. Obviously her parents had been New Agers in the 1990&#039;s or part of some other group who wanted as little to do with the rest of the world as possible. They&#039;d had a child, (and the confirmation over the phone that she didn&#039;t have either a birth certificate or school records made him think dark thoughts about their suitability as parents) and now she was a young adult in her own right she was trying to break away from her parents&#039; lifestyle.</p><p class="double">Despite everything, she&#039;d sounded both practical and educated which implied she&#039;d done the remarkable task of teaching herself rather than relying on a school. That was impressive, and the fact that she&#039;d wanted to keep the call short and that she had no number of her own suggested that she didn&#039;t have very much money. While he couldn&#039;t work pro bono (he had a payroll to meet after all) he decided to keep his fees to the minimum possible. The fact that she&#039;d also had a nice voice had nothing to do with it. </p><p class="double">After all this was the reason he&#039;d taken up law in the first place, to help people since his poor maths skill meant he couldn&#039;t study how to build spaceships...</p><p class="double">There was a scream from the outer office, and other noises of disturbance. He got up from behind his desk and strode over to the door, pulling it open. He wasn&#039;t prepared for the resulting view. Mrs Williams, his secretary, who up until today had been a pillar of adamantine steel against whom even the most furious or frantic antagonist had dashed themselves fruitlessly was scrabbling at her phone, which seemed glued to the desk with a faint purple glow. Of the two law students who worked for him part time, Alexis was similarly frozen while Jason was trying to open the main door which seemed similarly jammed.</p><p class="double">But the centrepiece to this tableaux, and the probable cause, was the small purple unicorn... winged unicorn... who stood in the middle of the main office with a pained expression. The fact that she was wearing a women&#039;s business suit tailored to her form, complete with white blouse, neat blue cravat, sensible grey pleated skirt and even white leg stockings on her hind legs, was just a counterpoint to the general bizarreness. Either her hooves were naturally a glossy black, or she&#039;d painted them somehow.</p><p class="double">He cut off a meandering mental question as to who would sell pots of nail polish that big and tried to re-establish some vestige of long fled sanity. &quot;What is going on here?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn spoke in a voice he recognised. &quot;My name is Twilight Sparkle. I made an appointment yesterday. I know I&#039;m a few minutes early, but I didn&#039;t want to waste your valuable time. I&#039;m also sorry if I startled people when I teleported in, but I didn&#039;t want to be seen entering the building for obvious reasons.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mrs Williams finally recovered enough to speak. &quot;But you&#039;re a... a...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I am an alien. That is point of fact the problem.&quot; She gave a weary sigh. &quot;Look, in a few seconds I&#039;m going to release the door and phones. At that point do what you will, call the police, the army, animal control, whatever! Just don&#039;t expect me to hang around after you do. I&#039;m trying to avoid trouble, either causing it or being in the centre of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The glow faded and the door opened, while Mrs Williams found herself holding her phone. Twilight Sparkle lifted a hoof and made what seemed to be a &#039;go ahead&#039; gesture.</p><p class="double">Now that the initial panic had worn off, the various people seemed at something of a loss as to what to do, and slightly shame faced. Aliens stomping around blowing things up were something popular culture had prepared them for. Aliens trying to be friendly by flashing lights and playing brass instruments or even trying to make interstellar collect calls were in there too, but not so much since the recent unpleasantness. Aliens making appointments to see a lawyer was not.</p><p class="double">James decided that he&#039;d never forgive himself if he didn&#039;t find out what was going on and said, &quot;I think it&#039;s best if everybody just continues what they&#039;re doing, while I talk to our visitor.&quot;</p><p class="double">He stepped back and gestured for her to come into his private office. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double">39.3 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in an endless sea of white. It was like being buried in clouds, except she couldn&#039;t even feel her own body. &quot;Hello?&quot; At least she could hear herself.</p><p class="double"><i>Hello, Twilight.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight whipped her head back and forth. At least, she thought she did. The view didn&#039;t change any. &quot;Who&#039;s there? What&#039;s going on? How do you know my name?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I am the Anchor of this Loop. I know your name because it is my function to know such things. As for what is going on, that is rather more complicated.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath and collected her thoughts. Okay, telepathic voice offering information. She&#039;d be a fool not to listen. &quot;Well, I&#039;m not going anywhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a psychic chuckle. <i>Indeed. You are currently a sort of living ideal. You have no true physical body, living instead in the minds of others.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;A memetic life form?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>As good an explanation as any.</i></p><p class="double">After a moment of consideration, Twilight asked, &quot;You said I was an ideal. An ideal what?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>An excellent question. You exist as the perfect leader, the soul of a nation, the guide to greatness.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve ruled nations many times, and I may be good at it, but I&#039;m far from perfect.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>We all have our faults. But even now, there is a tribe of hunter-gatherers who are discovering the link between seeds and plants, and they long for order, organization, and insight. They dream of you, Twilight.</i></p><p class="double">She was starting to feel uncomfortable. &quot;I don&#039;t want to be worshipped.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Nor should you. You are not a god. You are limited by your people&#039;s productivity, their happiness, their finances. But you can drive to them to heights of achievement that would otherwise be impossible. Their scientists will research what you deem worthy. Their armies will follow your every command. Their culture will be as you shape it.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight floated in the void, silent, considering.</p><p class="double"><i>Or you could float here for a few millennia, until the end of the Loop.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, when you put it that way…&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Excellent. Then I have but one more task to fulfill, as is my duty.</i> The voice cleared its unseen throat, switching to audible speech.</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings to you, Twilight Sparkle, youngest of the ageless alicorns and Anchor of your Loop.

This is a sister loop--did you ascend without me knowing about it? Like, in a fused loop or anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeeenope.&quot; The red pony watched as an umbrella lashed a licorice whip and rode by on end table made of felt. &quot;So... this is tha Discordian era?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, it is, we&#039;re Celestia and Luna – I&#039;m sorry, I just... usually this only happens AFTER a pony becomes an alicorn on their own.&quot; Twilight narrowed her eyes. &quot;Are you absolutely one hundred percent sure...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, Ah&#039;ve been nothing but an ordinary earth pony afore this... cept when Ah was a human. Ah&#039;m as clueless as ya&#039;ll.&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender mare let out a growling sigh. &quot;We&#039;ll figure it out later, then. So, since this is your first sister loop--well, I guess it&#039;s a sibling loop, cause--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Macintosh blushed, fidgeting a bit. &quot;No, no, it&#039;s... it&#039;s a sister loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Oh. Huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">She blinked again. &quot;OH! Oh this is the first time you&#039;ve been genderbent while Awake! Oh, yeah, okay, that could be awkward.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&#039;while Awake?&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeeeeeeah, genderbending happens pretty often. There&#039;s around a two percent chance you&#039;ll wake up and, POOF!&quot; Twilight chuckled and rolled her eyes. &quot;Nothing to worry about, we&#039;ve all been through it. And hey, you&#039;re still pretty big!&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Anyway, we need to distribute the Elements between us now--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, AJ&#039;s been a stallion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mac.&quot; Twilight spread the necklaces, although she put the tiara on her own head. &quot;Elements.&quot;</p><p class="double">The red pony shook her head. &quot;Right, right. Sorry. Has Apple Bloom--?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;El. Eh. Mints.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh nodded. &quot;Um.... Ah think, since Ah&#039;m AJ&#039;s brother, ah should have--&quot;</p><p class="double">Instantly Twilight&#039;s hoof lashed out, pulling the orange necklace away. &quot;Nuh-uh, not after hiding for who knows how many loops. Here, take Kindness instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">The former stallion eyed the pink butterfly warily for a moment. Then, with a shrug, she put it around her neck; might as well go full scale with this. &quot;Ah think Ah&#039;ll take Loyalty too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared as she wrapped the red lightning bolt around her thick ankle. &quot;....I am so jealous of you right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing.&quot; Twilight coughed. &quot;So, um... Generosity for you, then? And I&#039;ll take Laughter... I&#039;m going to need to teach you how to use these, aren&#039;t I?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">39.5 (Leonite, FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Yugi smiled as he leaned back, his arms behind his head. &quot;So yeah... that&#039;s pretty much the basics of the game and this loop.&quot; He explained. Before him was a young red haired girl with an excited gleam in her eye and energy to burn. &quot;I&#039;m surprised Twilight didn&#039;t explain this, she really seems to enjoy her loops here.&quot;</p><p class="double">The red haired girl simply grinned. &quot;Ah&#039;m more excited at the tech being used for all this. Your sayin&#039; that y&#039;all have holographic tech despite bein&#039; a baseline human world?&quot; She asked, playing down a face down card. Bloom Wheeler, or as Yugi had guessed earlier in the day, Apple Bloom, had replaced Serenity Wheeler for this loop. She had also proceeded to heal her eyesight in ways that not only had the doctors baffled but both Yugi and Joey knowing that she cheated, given that her own words to them when asked were: &quot;Ah&#039;m not missin out on a single moment in this loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorta. It&#039;s all being used for the purposes of enhancing Duel Monsters at the moment.&quot; Yugi stated, even as he flipped up a trap to counter her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, so advanced tech is being used for the sole purpose of-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, we&#039;ve heard that reaction before.&quot; Yugi interrupted with a nervous chuckle. Not entirely good memories in those loops. &quot;Still, with a few nudges, it gets picked up fast by pretty much everyone.&quot; He added, drawing a card and playing down Blackland Fire Dragon. The loop was still early, after all he hadn&#039;t even faced Kaiba yet and so still had his old deck. &quot;I attack.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom grunted, even as she mentally calculated. &quot;Right... then lets see if ah can do this.&quot; She stated, drawing a card... and grinning. &quot;Ah win.&quot;</p><p class="double">Yugi blinked. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah win. I drew Apple-Xodia.&quot; Bloom stated with a cheeky grin, flipping the cards around, to show each looked like an equine version of Exodia on an apple background.</p><p class="double">Yugi blinked... then grinned, even as golden light surrounded him. While he looked slightly taller and with a more serious look, Bloom could tell by his attitude that this wasn&#039;t the same Yugi. &quot;Well done, it takes a lot to get such blatant cheating past my partner.&quot; Atem commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheatin&#039;? Ah see no cheatin&#039; here, I won it fair an&#039; square.&quot; Bloom remarked as she retained the same grin.</p><p class="double">Atem just grinned. &quot;Just don&#039;t try it with the holograms, these cards have microchips in them for recognition and the Duel Disks especially can detect cheating&quot; He pointed out. He gathered up his cards into the deck and shuffled, Bloom doing the same. &quot;Now, if you want cheating, let me tell you the time I turned one of Kaiba&#039;s biggest monsters against him.&quot;</p><p class="double">They began again. Then Bloom laid down a spell card on her first turn, and Yugi&#039;s face met the desk. &quot;Honestly, Bloom...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? Ain&#039;t nothin&#039; wrong with the card, &#039;cept Ah&#039;m gonna win next turn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29924" rel="nofollow">Test of Endurance</a> isn&#039;t even from Duel Monsters!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pfft. Details.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double">39.6 (misterq)</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Three hours after he was supposed to be there, Kakashi opened the door in the classroom to take a closer look at his new team, provided they wouldn&#039;t fail his test. Three kunoichis together on a team wasn&#039;t very common, but it had happened before.</p><p class="double">What worried the jonin was that the pink-haired girl was excitingly pumping her hands up and down close to her body while chanting &#039;Ninja party! Ninja party!&#039;; while across from her, the blue-haired girl was doing the same thing, except chanting &#039;Explosive tags! Explosive tags!&#039;.</p><p class="double">Between them, the blond girl was staring at nothing in particular and occasionally shivering, as if anticipating some horrible future calamity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, my cute little students. My first impression of you..,&quot; Kakashi managed to say before being cut off by a pink blur that resolved itself into a girl, standing on a chair, whose face was only half an inch away from his own.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you our new sensei? Oh, what&#039;s your speciality? Do you like parties? Do you know how to make seals? They seem like a fun thing to learn. Do you wear that mask because you have horrible breath? I like balloons! Do you think I can make a taijutsu style based on that?&quot; Words poured from her mouth in a never-ending stream.</p><p class="double">Kakashi placed a hand over the girl&#039;s mouth to get a moment&#039;s reprieve, &quot;I think I hate you all.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blond girl snorted in amusement, &quot;Have a nice how do you do to you, as well. Welcome to team seapony diplomacy. Let&#039;s hope we all survive.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Survive? You won&#039;t be taking on hazardous missions until you pass training,&quot; Kakashi said.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was speaking of training,&quot; the blond girl said, adding, &quot;The name&#039;s Applejack. The pink thing licking the inside of your hand is Pinkie Pie. The one drawing explosive tag runes on everything is Trixie. Please take care of us and may whatever kami you worship have mercy on your soul.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi sweat-dropped and pulled his now moist hand away from the grinning girl&#039;s mouth.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next day at the training ground, Kakashi strode up to his new potential students. Applejack had made herself a small bunker using what looked like freshly uprooted trees. Pinkie Pie was running around arms outstretched, and making zoom-zoom noises. Trixie was reading a book on the sealing arts that Kakashi could have sworn was only available to ANBU members.</p><p class="double">This just cemented his planned course of action to fail this team and wait another year until the fourth&#039;s son and the last Uchiha graduated.</p><p class="double">One explanation of the test later, Kakashi was finishing up, &quot;All you have to do to be one of the two that pass is get one of these bells from me before noon. Starting now. Any questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie raised her hand, &quot;Do you mean these bells?&quot;</p><p class="double">She raised her other arm which was holding two very familiar bells.</p><p class="double">Kakashi blinked, then looked down at his belt. His bells were gone. &quot;What? How did..?&quot;</p><p class="double">He looked up to see Pinkie Pie now holding a very familiar book.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooh, what&#039;s this story about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not for children!&quot; Kakashi shunshined and grabbed his book before Pinkie could read any of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! Stand right there,&quot; Trixie exclaimed, &quot;I have no idea how sensitive my new motion detecting explosive tag is. That&#039;s why I made hundreds of them. I didn&#039;t have enough paper, so I used leaves.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi stood very still. His well developed danger sense was suddenly screaming at him. He looked downward, and yes, he was standing on a pile of seal-inscribed leaves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you said whoever gets the bells, passes, right?&quot; Pinkie exclaimed, &quot;So here you go, you two.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gave one bell to each of her team mates. &quot;I got the bells first, so I passed. Now you two have the bells so you pass! We all pass!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not how it works,&quot; Kakashi said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure it does!&quot; the pink-haired girl chirped, &quot;I even knew you were going to be busy so I forged your name on all the correct papers. We&#039;re a team now, so you have to get ready for the &#039;Kakashi passed a team&#039; party. It&#039;s in your apartment, sensei. I&#039;ve already invited all of your friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack casually lifted one of the enormous trees in her impromptu fort and walked out, waving, &quot;Thanks for the test. I mean, it&#039;ll be good to have one normal person on this team, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie waved also as she walked away, adding, &quot;No sudden movements, unless you want to let me know what the blast radius is.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi waited until the girls were no longer in sight, before sighing sadly, &quot;This is my life now. But with those skills; if I&#039;m lucky, I can get them to chunin before the year is out.&quot;</p><p class="double">A stray leaf fell from a nearby tree and drifted passed, only slightly brushing the jonin&#039;s nose.</p><p class="double">Kakashi sneezed.</p><p class="double">As he noticed all the leaves around him were now armed and glowing angrily, his last thought before waking up in the hospital was, &#039;Under no circumstances should that Trixie ever, ever meet Deidara.&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Far off in the Land of Tea, Twilight put down her book as she heard a large explosion in the distance. She looked up at her mentor, Celestia, who was currently taking Tsunade&#039;s place in this loop, &quot;So who do you think that was? Trixie? Pinkie Pie? The Crusaders? They&#039;re all awake this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tsunade thought about it before shrugging, &quot;Who knows. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find out shortly. I think I&#039;m just going to take my winnings and try every one of the different teas they have here. So many blends. So many.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just sighed in exasperation and went back to reading her book of advanced medical jutsus.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile back at the academy, several voices rang out in unison, &quot;We&#039;re going to be the most famous super awesome ninja ever! Go Ninja Sage Crusaders!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dattebayo!&quot; one of the young voices added.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">39.7 (FanOfMostEverything)</p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Smart Cookie found life with Apple Bloom oddly familiar. Once again, she was the advisor of a mare with far more brilliance than common sense, and so her duty was to sort the good ideas from the bad. And, as with Puddinghead, Cookie was frequently rebuffed, if not outright ignored.</p><p class="double">Of course, that didn&#039;t mean she was going to stop trying. &quot;Before we begin,&quot; she said to the clubhouse at large, &quot;I would like to say once again that this is a monumentally bad idea. I would say it&#039;s right up there with that time the chancellor wanted to put us on the potato standard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Weren&#039;t potatoes discovered after the Exodus?&quot; noted Clover.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. They were. Parliament was complaining about inflation, so Puddinghead made up the word one day and said that since it didn&#039;t exist at all, it was an even better choice than gold. <i>That</i> is how bad this idea is, and you&#039;re being <i>serious</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">Before the assembled Crusaders and Devices could consider this further, Apple Bloom waved a hoof dismissively. &quot;Aw, c&#039;mon, Cookie, quit exaggeratin&#039;. Ain&#039;t that bad. B&#039;sides, yer scarin&#039; &#039;em.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you&#039;re scaring me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What <i>is</i> your idea, Apple Bloom?&quot; asked Sweetie Belle. She wanted more information before she decided whether or not to be scared.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s real simple,&quot; Bloom began. &quot;See, we&#039;ve all gotten our cutie marks b&#039;fore, but they never stuck. But there is somethin&#039; that sticks from Loop t&#039; Loop once y&#039; pull it off.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Subspace pockets?&quot; guessed Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cool tricks from other universes?&quot; tried Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. &quot;Ascension.&quot;</p><p class="double">At first, the other Crusaders just boggled at her. That didn&#039;t last very long. &quot;WHAT!?&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth filly just smiled. &quot;Way Ah figure it, anythin&#039; that earns ya yer wings or horn or both has gotta be worth a permanent cutie mark!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle squirmed. &quot;Isn&#039;t that, well… drastic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Gotta be, if it&#039;s gonna last through th&#039; universe resettin&#039; itself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t we need something like the Elements of Harmony, though?&quot; Scootaloo thought back to the story of Rainbow Dash&#039;s ascension. &quot;Plus, we&#039;d need to do something that isn&#039;t just super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing, but related to our special talents.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly!&quot; Apple Bloom exclaimed. &quot;That&#039;s why it oughtta work in th&#039; first place.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you have feats in mind?&quot; asked Clover.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Sweetie&#039;s easy. Just gotta get &#039;er to start a big-enough heart-song.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn in question frowned. &quot;How big is &#039;big enough&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;I dunno. All o&#039; Equestria?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All of…&quot; Sweetie&#039;s mouth flapped silently as the very idea dropped stage fright on her like a ton of bricks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039; know which song&#039;d work fer that, though,&quot; Bloom admitted. &quot;Figured y&#039; might have some ideas, Sweetie.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pale filly had frozen in place at this point. She tipped over onto her side, totally stiff and unmoving.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo poked her. No reaction. &quot;Um, what did you have in mind for me, Apple Bloom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Less sure in yer case, Scoots. Somethin&#039; like that time with the weather-magic Blackbird might work, but it might not be enough. Maybe go &#039;round the world without flappin&#039; yer wings?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Without…&quot; Scootaloo didn&#039;t lock up. She did jump to her hooves, wings flared. &quot;Do you know how ridiculous that is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Ah&#039;ve hardly ever been a pegasus, so… nope!&quot; Apple Bloom smiled and shrugged. &quot;Ain&#039;t s&#039;pposed t&#039; be easy, Scoots. Otherwise, there&#039;d be a lot more alicorns.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, Miss Not-Supposed-To-Be-Easy. What about you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom scowled. &quot;That&#039;s th&#039; thing. Ah can&#039;t think of a darn thing fer me. Ah thought maybe inventin&#039; the Internet, but just gettin&#039; Equestria up t&#039; that point o&#039; technological advancement&#039;d prob&#039;ly take longer&#039;n one Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo settled back down and smirked. &quot;Seems perfect to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah guess, but… I dunno. It don&#039;t feel right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Does any part of this fool&#039;s errand?&quot; asked Smart Cookie.</p><p class="double">Sweetie shuddered and picked herself up off the floor. &quot;Um, maybe we should come up with ideas for one another?&quot;</p><p class="double">The other fillies considered this, nodding almost in sync. &quot;Meet back in a week?&quot; Scootaloo proposed.</p><p class="double">&quot;A moment, please,&quot; said Cookie. &quot;Pansy, Clover, please tell me you aren&#039;t actually encouraging them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re necklaces,&quot; noted Pansy. &quot;It&#039;s not like we can stop them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the concept is actually quite fascinating,&quot; Clover added. &quot;Applied apotheosis? Especially that of an unmarked filly? I&#039;m composing a theoretical framework as we speak.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine, then. Enjoy your folly, girls. If anypony wishes to be sane, you know where to find me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned. &quot;Well, you heard &#039;er, girls. See y&#039;all next week.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies brought raised forehooves together. &quot;<b>CUTIE MARK CRUSADER ALICORNS!

Then just add a touch of cinnamon, a dollop of orange juice for flavour, and garnish with a ruby and a tiny umbrella; and viola!&quot; Berry Punch held the enchanted glass container up triumphantly in one hoof. Suddenly, the tiny little wooden umbrella caught fire and burned away to nothing. The rest of the drink bubbled and shook violently but settled down in the end, &quot;One serving of Foofy, the magic dragon drink of doom. And I should probably think of a better name for it, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh and Trixie looked on in amazement from their makeshift bunker inside Big Mac&#039;s bar. Spike looked on eagerly at the drink as he sat at a nearby table. Twilight was maintaining a containment shield outside, as well as being – in her own words – ready to teleport any foolish pony before they start choking on the inevitable burning poisonous fumes.</p><p class="double">&quot;How the hay did you know how to make that?&quot; the red stallion asked in wonder.</p><p class="double">&quot;While you all have been going on adventures and being princess of the moon and everything, &quot; Berry gave Big Mac a knowing look, causing him to fidget uncomfortably at the memories of being an alicorn – a <i>female</i> alicorn. &quot;I have been perfecting my craft. I can mix any drink and make it better than perfect. I can brew the most powerful spirits known to pony-kind. I can make the most delicious wines I have ever tasted. I have learned long lost recipes from the ancient temples in the wild jungles to the ruins in the frozen valley. And several loops ago, I decided to study dragons to see if I could figure out a perfect drink for them. Do you know that their stomach is more like a magical fusion reactor?&quot;</p><p class="double">Every pony turned towards Spike. The baby dragon shrugged. &quot;I knew that. Then again, I also studied other dragons for many, many loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Here you go.&quot; The light purple earth pony carefully handed Spike the glass. &quot;Drink it quickly before the ingredients eat through the magical stabilization. On a scale of one to ten, this thing has a shelf life of nope, it doesn&#039;t have a shelf life. And never, ever serve it to a pony – or really, anyone other than a real equestrian dragon. Otherwise, the customer will explode. Then their remains will explode. Then, whatever is left will require Sparkle to hit it with another entire lake bed before it makes the surrounding area unlivable.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike gingerly held the glass before downing it all in one long gulp. He set down the empty container as his eyes widened and his pupils grew to twice their normal size.</p><p class="double">&quot;Duck and cover!&quot; Berry Punch shouted and ducked under a table. Big Red and Trixie wasted no time in flattening themselves in their bunker.</p><p class="double">Spike opened his mouth and burped out an immense gout of green fire.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, sorry about your bar, Big Macintosh,&quot; he said sheepishly. The ponies turned around and saw that there was a smouldering hole through the far wall, and one in the wall beyond that one, and another through the final wall. They could see a shocked Twilight outside still maintaining a shield around the establishment.</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem. I got a couple spares of my bar in my subspace pocket. I can use one of them while I repair this place.&quot; The red pony turned towards the stunned little dragon, &quot;So how was the drink, Spike?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It... was... the best thing I have ever tasted! Nectar of the universe!&quot; Spike said enthusiastically. &quot;You should totally give her a job.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, the results do speak for themselves, Berry. You&#039;ve got yourself a job,&quot; Big Mac said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. What? I never applied for a job here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh shrugged, &quot;As more ponies find out about this place, it starts to be too much for just me to handle everything. If you want it and can be all professional-like, you can have yourself a job here. So for the loops that you&#039;re here, Berry, you can make full use of your special talent and be appreciated for it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch took a few seconds before nodding with a grin, &quot;Alright, if you&#039;ll have me. I&#039;ve never worked for you before. Plus the whole, &#039;I can talk about the loops because you are a looper&#039; thing is handy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It sure is,&quot; Big Mac sighed. Gilda was great and even Chrysalis was nice once he got to know her, but he still wondered if Cheerilee would ever start looping.</p><p class="double">Loops made everything just plumb <i>confusing.</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;I recognize that type of sigh,&quot; Berry Punch said. &quot;So what&#039;s, or should I say who&#039;s on your mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac just smiled and shook his head, &quot;Eenope. It&#039;s only your first day. Customers first. The bartender&#039;s problems are something for much later on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fair enough. Just give me a tour of the place and I can start helping with the cleaning. I doubt we&#039;re going to get too many customers with all those danger ribbons cordoning off the place while Sparkle maintains a magical shield.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you guys done it there?&quot; came Twilight&#039;s voice from outside, &quot;What was that fire blast? Spike, are you okay in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike the dragon just rocked slowly in his seat, mumbling, &quot;So good,&quot; over and over.</p><p class="double">Trixie strode out and exclaimed &quot;Success! For my next attempt at a drink for dragons, I shall try to create magical cold fusion in a glass!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm,&quot; Berry Punch contemplated. &quot;I actually have several ideas about that using flavored deuterium, tritium, and lime juice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac watched as the two mares climbed upstairs, talking while they toured his place. Then he looked at the dragon-caused hole in the nearest wall that was no longer only smouldering, but was merrily on fire. Perhaps it was time to seriously reinforce his bar.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile, in Canterlot, Princess Celestia looked down at the three circular pieces of different walls that had appeared in front of her before falling on the floor with a clatter. She looked towards her sister for a possible explanation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope,&quot; Princess Luna looked up at her sister and shook her head slowly. &quot;We have got nothing.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.2 (anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna did not usually consider herself an experienced Looper. She knew that her sister had experienced more lives than her own count, let alone the sheer number that the Elements of Harmony had lived. She was slightly afraid to ask Twilight Sparkle how old she was, for she had little doubt that the (usually) unicorn Anchor was possibly her elder by now.</p><p class="double">Almost all of Luna&#039;s loops took place in an Equestria much like the long-ago baseline, so she had long since grown used to Awaking on the moon, a far cry from the horror and panic she had felt the first time she had been returned to her prison. Still, the rare instances where she found herself coming to anywhere else were a pleasant change of pace.</p><p class="double">Even when she Awoke in a dirty alley with a too-bright morning sun in her eyes, like this Loop. Although she was in her accustomed alicorn form, the architecture surrounding her was enough to tell that this was probably some variation on the human world.</p><p class="double">“...is that a horse?” The trio of human males staring at her may have also been a small clue.</p><p class="double">“Be quiet,” Luna ordered. “I am trying to figure out who I am.” Loop memories could be tricky sometimes, but these were fragmentary even for that and trying to figure them out was rapidly giving her a headache.</p><p class="double">“...a <i>talking</i> horse?” one of the humans asked.</p><p class="double">“I said, be quiet!” Luna roared, and the humans scattered. She took a calming breath and tried to make sense of her new memories. She was... a survivor of a lost, ancient kingdom on the moon? Fair enough. She had some kind of mission too... the old enemy that had destroyed her people was returning, and it was her duty to defend the Earth against them. Check.</p><p class="double">Now, how was she supposed to do that? Luna searched her scattered Loop memories.</p><p class="double">“...find the Moon Princess?” she asked herself aloud. A little worried, she turned her head and was relieved to see her familiar mark on her flank. “That was easy,” she said. “Now what?”</p><p class="double">A commotion at the entrance of the alleyway made her raise her head again. She took one look at the murmuring crowd of humans, then transformed herself to shadow and escaped. If this – maddeningly vague in her Loop memories – enemy really was out there searching for her, discretion would be the better part of valor for the moment.</p><p class="double">That discretion lasted only until the early evening, when Luna was stirred from her nap on a high rooftop after a long day spent searching without luck for Twilight Sparkle. There was the crawling sensation of a dark presence nearby, and it reminded her just a little of how her own magic felt when she was Nightmare Moon. Before she even had a chance to consider Luna was in the air, searching for the abomination.</p><p class="double">She had a duty to protect her subjects, after all. Even if they weren&#039;t her usual subjects, and even if they didn&#039;t know they were her subjects yet.</p><p class="double">It took only a brief search, and it was only a moment&#039;s work after shattering the gem store window with her hooves to dispatch the demon. She had perhaps over-estimated the monster&#039;s strength; she&#039;d hoped to interrogate it but was left with only a pile of magically inert dust. She felt a little guilty for a moment, but she was uncertain the creature had been sentient to begin with, and it <i>had</i> been threatening a young human filly. Girl. Whatever.</p><p class="double">She checked the human – fainted, like the other humans scattered about the store – and cast a simple charm to ensure restful dreams before she was interrupted.</p><p class="double">“Who... what are you?” the male voice asked from above.</p><p class="double">Luna looked up to the high window she&#039;d broken, and saw a male, masked human figure in a strange outfit. Possibly the human version of a tuxedo, she decided. “It is polite to give one&#039;s own name first,” she returned, stretching her wings. Perhaps this was the person responsible for the monster; she sensed magic on him, unlike any other humans she&#039;d encountered this Loop.</p><p class="double">“You talk!” the man exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“So do you,” Luna replied archly. She hated these Loops where equines weren&#039;t intelligent by default. Perhaps she should do something about that when she had a chance.</p><p class="double">“I... I am... Tuxedo Mask,” the man said.</p><p class="double">“I see,” Luna said dubiously. She was reasonably sure that wasn&#039;t how humans named themselves this Loop. “I am Luna, the Princess of the Moon.”</p><p class="double">The man staggered like he&#039;d been hit, raising one hand to his face. “But... you&#039;re a <i>horse</i>,” he protested.</p><p class="double">“Pony,” Luna corrected.</p><p class="double">“I... I need to go,” the man said. His cape swirled, there was a flare of magic, and he was gone.</p><p class="double">Luna nodded to herself. Tuxedo guy was <i>definitely </i>suspicious.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Many of her classmates held the strong belief that Ami Mizuno was not human. The debate raged furiously over whether she was a soulless cyborg from the distant future or an inscrutable extrusion of a vast alien intelligence, but even here at cram school there were only a few lonely voices that supported her claim to humanity.</p><p class="double">It was perhaps a shame that all the other students were unconscious, because this afternoon – confronted with the unimaginable circumstance of being rescued by what she didn&#039;t yet know to call an alicorn princess from an actual demonic monster – she proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that she was a flesh-and-blood teenage girl.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re a <i>pony</i>!” Ami squealed in delight.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I am.” The equine paused. “Excuse me.” There was a flash of dark blue light, and the demonic schoolteacher flew back into the wall she&#039;d been bucked into moments previously.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re a <i>magic unicorn talking pegasus pony</i>!”</p><p class="double">“Do human&#039;s foreheads normally glow in this world?” the pony asked.</p><p class="double">“...no?” Ami said, suddenly feeling a strange sensation there and being shaken enough from Pony Proximity Euphoria Syndrome into realizing that, perhaps, this situation was <i>slightly</i> unusual. Almost downright unscientific.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” the winged creature said. Another flash of blue light revealed a small... pen? “I am Princess Luna,” she said, “and if I can trust these cursed defective memories, you are supposed to be Sailor Mercury, one of the guardian soldiers of the Moon Princess.”</p><p class="double">Ami stared at the pony.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s me, by the way,” Luna added, apparently considering that the most pressing thing to clarify. Encased in dark light, the pen floated closer to Ami.</p><p class="double">There were plenty of really important questions she probably should have asked. “Will I get to ride you?” came out instead.</p><p class="double">Luna frowned. “I suppose,” she allowed.</p><p class="double">Ami&#039;s hand, without conscious direction, grabbed the floating pen. “Deal. Umm... Your Highness.”</p><p class="double">Behind Luna, the demonic monster stirred again. The equine princess stepped aside. “Show me what you can do,” she ordered.</p><p class="double">Ami blinked. Twice. Then the demon jumped for her and instincts she never knew she had made her raise the pen high, words she somehow knew by heart ripping from her throat.</p><p class="double">“Well, bubbles,” Luna said a few moments later. “I&#039;ve seen worse special talents. We can work with that.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For the first time in countless years stretching beyond the boundaries of this life, the four guardian soldiers of the Moon Princess were gathered. Perhaps they would have been more excited if they hadn&#039;t just been fighting for their lives against two of the Generals of the Dark Kingdom.</p><p class="double">“Well done, my soldiers!” Luna exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“...why do you have a talking horse?” the newly arrived Sailor Venus asked.</p><p class="double">“Pony,” Sailor Mercury insisted.</p><p class="double">“I am Luna,” the equine in question announced, “the Princess of the Moon.”</p><p class="double">Sailor Venus blinked several times. “The h-<i>pony</i> is the Moon Princess?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Luna</i>?” another voice interjected. A white blur came down from somewhere and landed on Venus&#039;s shoulder.</p><p class="double">“...why do you have a talking cat?” Sailor Jupiter asked, her arms crossing.</p><p class="double">“Sister?” Luna asked cautiously, staring at the white cat with a golden moon on its forehead. Her accursed, near-useless Loop memories throbbed, like she should have recognized the feline.</p><p class="double">Venus giggled. “Sister? I knew there was something you weren&#039;t telling me, Artemis.”</p><p class="double">The cat swatted at her face with one paw. “I <i>told</i> you, it&#039;s not my fault the Greeks got my gender wrong.”</p><p class="double">It had been a long shot, but Luna was still disappointed. As far as she could without explaining the Loops to the human girls, she&#039;d searched for any sign that anypony – or even any<i>one</i> – else was Awake, and had found nothing.</p><p class="double">Artemis was now staring at her. “You&#039;re... Luna?” he asked.</p><p class="double">Luna tried to force her Loop memories to tell her who this cat was supposed to be to her, but came up with nothing. “I&#039;m sorry,” she said. “I do not remember who you are.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not sure I remember who <i>you</i> are,” Artemis said. “I... I didn&#039;t think you were a horse.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Pony</i>,” Sailor Mercury corrected again. Really, she got more offended by that than Luna did herself.</p><p class="double">“More importantly,” Venus interjected, glancing at her passenger. “<i>Is</i> she the Moon Princess?”</p><p class="double">“Of course I am,” Luna answered. If there was anything she was sure of in this Loop, it was that.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Artemis sounded a little dubious. He raised one paw to his head, like he was warding off a headache.</p><p class="double">“I could lower the moon now to prove it,” Luna offered – there was no point getting offended, given that the cat&#039;s memories of the old kingdom were probably as bad as her own. “It would probably panic the populace though.” She <i>never</i> felt right in these – usually human – loops where the moon and sun just went up and down on their own. It was downright unscientific. “Maybe we could go visit the old castle again?”</p><p class="double">“Umm... I don&#039;t think that&#039;s necessary, Your Highness,” Sailor Mercury said quickly. Luna was a gracious enough ruler to pretend not to notice the warning signs her guardians were giving the newcomer and her cat. Really, forget one lousy oxygen spell and you never live it down.</p><p class="double">Sailor Venus seemed to think for a moment, then knelt. Artemis lost his balance, and leaped down to the ground. “I am Sailor Venus, or Minako Aino, Your Highness,” the blonde girl said.</p><p class="double">Luna smiled. “Rise, my guardian.”</p><p class="double">“Are you <i>sure </i>you&#039;re supposed to be a pony?” Artemis whined plaintively.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The time had come for the final battle. It would happen here, in the heart of the Dark Kingdom itself, buried beneath the North Pole. (When Luna recounted the story to Twilight in her next Loop, that bit would send the unicorn on a particularly entertaining rant.) Minor demons scattered, unwilling to face the furious alicorn princess.</p><p class="double">“Moon Princess,” the waiting queen said, shadows hanging off of her like physical things. She carried a tall staff, which she tapped on the onyx floor.</p><p class="double">“Release your hold on the sun and end this night,” Luna stated coldly, “and some mercy may be shown to you, witch.” The air was thick with dark magic, enough that Luna half-feared to see black corruption staining her flank just from being here.</p><p class="double">The ruler of the Dark Kingdom threw back her head and laughed. “Foolish Princess. You think that I <i>could</i> bring back the sun? It is our Great Leader&#039;s power that blackens the day, not mine.”</p><p class="double">“Then I shall destroy you both,” Luna said.</p><p class="double">Her enemy laughed again. “You seek to slay both I and Queen Metallia alone, Princess?”</p><p class="double">“Not alone,” Luna said grimly, and she spread her wings. In this place, for once her darkly colored magic shone brightly, and the four she carried hidden underneath them returned to their full size, two on each side. “The guardian soldiers of the Moon Princess,” she proclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Sailor Mercury,” one said.</p><p class="double">“Sailor Mars.”</p><p class="double">“Sailor Jupiter.”</p><p class="double">“Sailor Venus.”</p><p class="double">“And in the name of the Princess, we will punish you!” the four finished in unison. Artemis had been upset to be left behind, but this was no place for a cat.</p><p class="double">The woman they faced just laughed again. “Endymion... kill them.” The shadows surrounding her parted slightly, revealing the man who knelt at her left, kissing her hand.</p><p class="double">He rose, drawing a sword. “Yes, Queen Beryl.” Luna was pretty sure she recognized him, and she snorted. She&#039;d <i>known</i> that tuxedo guy was up to no good.</p><p class="double">Endymion jumped high in the air, raising his sword for a downward slash. “Girls,” Luna prompted, and her guardians acted.</p><p class="double">Sailor Mercury clenched a fist, and a cloud of bubbles shrouded the man&#039;s head. Sailor Jupiter met him in midair, dodging the wild, blind swing of his sword and tackling him to the ground, lightning crackling around them. Still blinded, Endymion managed to throw her off but lost a hold of his weapon. Arcs of fire from Sailor Mars&#039;s hands pushed him back, and then a golden spear of light from Sailor Venus punched through his chest armor.</p><p class="double">The dark warrior gasped, staggered once, then collapsed at his queen&#039;s feet. Beryl&#039;s hand tightened around her staff. “<i>You</i>,” she snarled.</p><p class="double">“He&#039;ll live,” Luna said, keeping her voice cold. This wasn&#039;t the time for sympathy.</p><p class="double">“Just <i>die</i>!” Beryl roared, raising her staff and a hurricane of dark magic swept the room. Luna had barely a moment to shield her friends and then she was caught up in the storm. “Die, Moon Princess!” Beryl shouted again.</p><p class="double">Luna called on her own power and the winds stilled. She steadied herself with a beat of her wings and fired a moonlight spear at Beryl. The woman blocked it with a wall of black lightning, but it was only a distraction.</p><p class="double">Luna landed smoothly and was relieved to find all four of her guardians standing. “Now,” she said. Each of the four girls pulled out a small, brightly colored gemstone, while Luna summoned the three she&#039;d kept for herself. (She would have to ask Twilight if there had been any Loops with seven Elements of Harmony, as these “Rainbow Crystals” were clearly the local equivalent.)</p><p class="double">Beryl&#039;s eyes widened. “What,” she started. With practiced ease, Luna called forth the gemstone&#039;s power, merging it with the magics summoned by her guardians. The whole vast throne chamber started to shake, and Beryl stepped backward, her staff falling from her hands. “No!”</p><p class="double">As if in answer, a ball of white light formed in front of Luna. The dark force saturating this place stirred, but too late. “This ends now,” Luna declared, and the bright magic consumed everything.</p><p class="double">It was a strangely intimate thing, and Luna wondered if this was what it was like for Twilight Sparkle when she healed Nightmare Moon. The dark power – the “Great Leader” – Luna scoured from the world, dissolving every last strand of its being; it was utterly inequine and beyond salvation. Yet when she looked in her foes&#039; hearts, she found something different.</p><p class="double">Endymion – the tuxedo guy – had been being brainwashed after all. Well, that was easily fixed with this power.</p><p class="double">Beryl, though? Madness and betrayed hurt, a lust for power and recognition, callous disregard for the lives of others... all of that and more Luna found. But down in her heart, deep beneath everything, Luna found a girl who wanted to be loved. “Be healed,” Luna whispered and then, more than aware of the irony, she sent the dark queen to slumber on the moon.</p><p class="double">The light faded, and when it did the seven Rainbow Crystals were gone. Instead, a single gem floated before her horn.</p><p class="double">Endymion, his wounds healed, rose to one knee, staring at it. “The Silver Crystal,” he breathed. “You <i>are</i> the Moon Princess.”</p><p class="double">Luna still didn&#039;t know why everyone seemed to find that hard to believe. “I am,” she said.</p><p class="double">“I... just don&#039;t understand,” Endymion said. “Why are you a horse?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s a <i>pony</i>!” Sailor Mercury declared, throwing up her hands. “Why am I the only one who <i>sees</i> that?”</p><p class="double">Luna snorted in amusement, but her mind was elsewhere. She had <i>still</i> yet to find a single other Awake soul in this Loop, and if she understood one thing from Twilight Sparkle&#039;s explanations, it was that there always must be an Anchor in every loop. Surely Twilight would have found a way to contact her by now, but Luna knew that it was possible for her to enter a fused loop with a different Anchor.</p><p class="double">So... where was this Loop&#039;s Anchor?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In her small bedroom, Usagi finished laughing and let the image die on the crystal ball she&#039;d stolen from Beryl... oh, at least a thousand loops prior. She reached down and was sad to discover that the bag of popcorn she&#039;d brought up here was empty.</p><p class="double">“I hope you&#039;re happy,” a familiar voice came from nowhere.</p><p class="double">Usagi turned and watched the green-haired woman step out of thin air. “Oh come on, Puu,” she said, sitting straighter on her bed. “This is <i>hilarious</i>.”</p><p class="double">Perhaps a smile flickered briefly on the woman&#039;s face, but it was gone a moment later. “You realize that she sets up Endymion with Beryl later.”</p><p class="double">Usagi shrugged. “Not the real Mamo-chan, not my problem,” she said. “<i>I&#039;ve</i> done that a few dozen times. They make a cute couple when she isn&#039;t evil.”</p><p class="double">Sailor Pluto just stared at her. “You <i>know</i> how much work this is for me.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll help?” Usagi offered. “Look, I was going to introduce myself, and then she just went and proclaimed herself the Moon Princess! I <i>had</i> to see what was going to happen.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, you&#039;re going to help,” Sailor Pluto hissed. “Do you have <i>any</i> idea what Crystal Tokyo looks like now?”</p><p class="double">“A lot more ponies, I guess?” Usagi proposed.</p><p class="double">“Thanks to Mercury&#039;s Equine Uplift Project and her Poniform Transformation Spell, yes.”</p><p class="double">“The mind boggles,” Usagi asked. “Dare I ask where we&#039;re going to get a Chibi-Horse-Luna?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna stood tall and proud atop one of the skyscrapers of this human city, her mane blowing in the wind as she watching over the dreams of the sleepers below. This Loop was still a little strange, but, setting aside the question of the missing Anchor, it wasn&#039;t bad, really. The victory party had been fun, even if she&#039;d needed to dust off an old spell for taking on human form to avoid attracting too much attention.</p><p class="double">After so many Loops of being the ancient returning villain, it was refreshing to be the prophesied reborn heroine. And now, with the Dark Kingdom defeated and its queen safely imprisoned – though from her sifting though dreams she already could tell that the humans were a <i>little</i> concerned about the sudden appearance of a female face on their moon – she could start making longer term plans. Perhaps she could rebuild those old ruins up there to give herself a more comfortable place to call home? Or maybe she should just go public... the options seemed truly limitless.</p><p class="double">That was when <i>something</i> opened above her head and deposited a creature on her back. Luna grabbed it with her magic and brought it to float in front of her.</p><p class="double">The pink-maned alicorn filly started back at her, then giggled. “Yay! Hi, big sister!”</p><p class="double">Luna broke into a smile. “Hello, Celestia,” she said. “I&#039;m glad to see you.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.3 (Stavaros_Arcane)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Mac put the finishing touching on setting up his bar for this loop. He&#039;d gotten enough practice doing it that he could have a full stocked, ready to go drinking establishment open for business quick enough that you could almost Awaken in a loop with a drink in your hoof.</p><p class="double">Big Mac polished a glass while he waited for whoever was awake this loop to arrive to plan out their summer sun celebration shenanigans. What he did not expect was the door to be almost kicked off its hinges and a massive mountain of an equine to storm in.</p><p class="double">Mac thought the newcomer resembled the Horses of Saddle Arabia but the comparison felt...wrong. While the Saddle Arabians conveyed the calm of a breeze through an oasis, the new comer felt like someone had strapped a blizzard and a typhoon together and then shoved them in the form of a horse made of iron.</p><p class="double">There was the clop of heavy hooves as the newcomer approached the bar. It was then that Big Mac noticed something. The number of hoof beats was wrong. As though two ponies were walking in instead of one. A glance downward showed why. Eight legs. The stallion had eight legs. That made him...</p><p class="double">Big Mac looked up to find the dark grey stranger – <i>Sleipnir </i>– had closed the distance from the door to the bar counter. While there had been ponies tall enough to force Big Mac to look up in order to meet their eyes, never had anypony make him feel so small, even the Princesses or Twilight during his early loops didn&#039;t make him feel quite like this. Like he was a tiny speck in the vast cosmos, and yet the cosmos had turned its attention to him. Even for a looper it was rather intimidating – and usually Sleipnir had better control of his presence. Much better. To the point it was hard to notice the eight legs at times.</p><p class="double">But Big Mac was a rock, as like an apple tree with roots tapping into the very core of the world. He had spoken with beings of great wisdom that knew how to make the world turn on something as small as a tortoise turned right side up. So he did what he needed to do. Bartend.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;ll ya have?&quot; Mac asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll find behind your counter a cask of thrice blessed Aesir mead. We&#039;ll start with that and drink our way through the rest of your stock until the memories are well and truly drowned.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac was about to ask about the use of the term &quot;We&quot; when the Swiftest of Horses moved two of his limbs and lifted the shivering form of Twilight Sparkle off his back to plop her down on a seat beside him. &quot;Actually, grab me one of your families&#039; famous ciders. I&#039;ll hopefully be too drunk to truly appreciate them later.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac poured the drink order, briefly studying the cask that he knew had not been part of his stock a few minutes ago. As he placed the drinks in front of the two he asked &quot;Rough loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">He watched as in perfect unison the Anchor and the deity slugged back their mead, slammed their mugs down and said, &quot;You don&#039;t know the half of it!&quot; in unison.</p><p class="double">As Mac moved to refill their mugs the eight legged stallion drank his cider. Unlike the previous drink he savoured the flavour of the beverage. &quot;Twilight has just been through one of the worse hells you could inflict on a sane being. I would never wish it on any of my little ponies. So we&#039;re going to drink until those memories are two hazy to hurt anypony anymore, and then the healing can begin. I will make it up to you Twilight. &quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut in &quot;I appreciate what you&#039;re doing. Like you wouldn&#039;t believe,&quot; the Equestrian Anchor said as she took a large swig of her second drink. &quot; But I keep telling you that...&quot; Twilight shuddered. &quot;Wasn&#039;t your fault.&quot; she shoved the second empty mug to Mac and the red stallion refilled it again.</p><p class="double">Big Mac was now morbidly curious. &quot;She go through something bad in your home loop?&quot; he asked, assuming that Sleipnir&#039;s mysterious home loop had gone a little out of kilter.</p><p class="double">A smile briefly crossed the newcomers face, &quot;Nay, the suffering she went through happened in Equestria although you are closer then you realize. I blame myself because I should have been able to stop the file corruption in Equestria&#039;s Yggdrasil branch before it spawned that abomination scenario.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac blinked at the mention of the computer he&#039;d been told ran the multiverse. &quot;Wait... that means you&#039;re...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sleipnir Eight-Legged, Wotansteed, Lokison, Divine Beast First-Class, and System Administrator of the Equestrian Loops.&quot; The Horse God said. “Yes, I may have misled you a little on my importance; it comes of being related to Loki.”</p><p class="double">Big Mac blinked at the God and looked at Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">She shrugged. &quot;I was surprised too. Did not expect my first meeting with the god in charge of our loop to go like it did.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I didn&#039;t start my day thinking I&#039;d have to fend off an insane horde of ponies wielding a dragon tied to a toothless alligator either.&quot; Sleipnir snorted. &quot;I&#039;ll admit that was the only part of that loop that was remotely not traumatizing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac refilled their mugs yet again and poured himself one. He felt that he needed it. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered, finding herself almost curling up into a ball on instinct.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir looked like he was about to put a comforting hoof on the purple unicorn&#039;s shoulder before catching himself. She needed a few more drinks first to dull the emotional pain of that loop. &quot;We won&#039;t share the full extent of what happened. But it all started when I found some corrupt files in Equestria&#039;s systems. While the loops are beyond the control of even the gods, those of us who work with Yggdrasil&#039;s systems have the ability to influence them in certain ways. Programming an algorithm to drastically increase the probability of one emotionally distraught looper to visit a specific loop for their first fused loop. To rewrite code and allow a child to stay with their adopted mother instead of being wiped clean by a resetting loop. You get the idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir&#039;s demeanour seemed to change, giving off an almost paternal feel to the ponies around him. &quot;Of course then some idiot can just as easily cause misery and woe with an act of stupidity and crassness. The corrupt files created some unpleasant loops, and I wanted to track the source of them to help keep Equestria the safe loop you&#039;ve worked to make it. Well I found it. Somebody thought it would be a great idea to hide their massive collection of porn on my office computer. And I swear I will geld the Olympian son of an incestuous titan for it once I&#039;m done repairing the damage. The stuff was not only vile in its own right but was full of corrupt data and viruses, and the end result was beyond the stuff of night terrors.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir emptied his mug again and Big Mac pulled out a row of shot glasses and a couple of bottles. Sleipnir raised an eyebrow as the farm pony turned bartender shrugged. &quot;Mead&#039;s out. And this sounds like it&#039;s about to get worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grabbed the bottles with her magic and started rapidly filling each small glass. &quot;Eyup.&quot; Twilight said, stealing the stallions catchphrase. The alcohol was doing its work, which was the only thing keeping Twilight from starting to cry. &quot;You&#039;ve heard the horror stories about the loops with the insanely depraved alternate Celestia we call Molestia, right Big Mac.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac shuddered, &quot;Eyup.&quot; He&#039;d been lucky enough to avoid being Awake those loops so far but knew it was bound to happen sooner or later.</p><p class="double">Twilight continued. &quot;Now imagine an Equestria where her being in charge made <b>sense</b>!&quot;</p><p class="double">As Big Mac paled, Sleipnir picked up where Twilight left off, &quot;Whatever you are thinking of... It was worse. Not only was she in charge but she was the pinnacle of what every pony strove to be, the <i>ideal pony </i>in the eyes of her subjects! And Twilight was the only one Awake, the only sane mare in this mad mad mad mad mad mad mad mad world. And then this corrupted world painted a target on her by making her the most desirable mare alive to everyone in said world.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh mah god...&quot; Big Mac said his imagination giving life to a shadow of the terror described to him.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hear you.&quot; Sleipnir said with a nod. He barely registered what the last two shots he tossed back were. &quot;And then it got worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone in the room shuddered. Big Mac barely managed to get out a word. &quot;How?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir shook his head, &quot;You don&#039;t want to know. Trust me. YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment of silence and more bottles being brought out, Sleipnir spoke again. &quot;So I entered the Loop, something I&#039;ve tried to avoid because you ponies can handle yourselves without my meddling. Fought my way to Twilight Sparkle and then we both fought our way to the gates of Tartarus, changed which side of the door the locks were on, locked ourselves in, and then I called down a Gungnir strike ending the loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Never has a planet cracking divine orbital bombardment been more welcome.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now I&#039;m going to make it up to her, for all the suffering. This is a healing loop, and we&#039;re going to start by sterilizing the metaphorical wounds with alcohol. So. Cheers, everypony,&quot; he said, raising a glass to the group that had walked in during the tale of woe. The gathered Equestrian loopers rushed to comfort Twilight.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir smiled, glad he&#039;d had the forethought to have Spike message everyone who was Awake to join them. Now the healing could really begin. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.4 </p><p class="double">“Well, I hope never to have to detox Zeus&#039; account again,” Sleipnir said, sitting back on his rear legs with a long sigh.</p><p class="double">Loki leant back against the comforting bulk of his middle son, Fenris, and collapsed down his spear. “Indeed. What <i>was</i> that thing at the end?”</p><p class="double">“Basically Scylla and Charybdis merged with hentai,” Sleipnir answered. “<i>Not</i> fun.”</p><p class="double">Hel and Jormugandr trooped in, Hel&#039;s living side looking nearly as decrepit as her dead side and Jormugandr&#039;s crest drooping with exhaustion.</p><p class="double">“At least you didn&#039;t have to chase the thing down to be sure it was dead,” Jormugandr hissed.</p><p class="double">“And was it?” Sleipnir tapped on air, and his barding dematerialized.</p><p class="double">The world-serpent grinned, showing his myriad teeth. “Once I was done with it... <i>yes</i>.”</p><p class="double">Hel sat down next to her father. “It&#039;s good to have that over and done with...”</p><p class="double">“Sorry for calling you all into it,” Sleipnir said, embarrassed. “But, well, given that it had fused with Twilight&#039;s loop last time, I wasn&#039;t comfortable going in alone to make sure it was cleared off.”</p><p class="double">“Good call,” Fenris growled. “Not often we get to cut loose.”</p><p class="double">“You ate the planet.” Sleipnir paused. “Sort of planet. Well, okay, drive partition.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s what I do best.” Fenris chuckled.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir kicked him affectionately with a forehoof. “Goof.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s <i>me</i>, I think you&#039;ll find,” Loki pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Right, I think we might <i>all</i> need a drink after that. Wonder if Mac&#039;s got the bar set up yet...”</p><p class="double">“Why not just check?” Hel grinned. “Wonder how I&#039;d look as a pony.”</p><p class="double">Sleipnir summoned a Yggdrasil terminal. “Well, it might...” he tailed off, then blinked. “Huh.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Loki asked, craning to see the screen.</p><p class="double">In reply, Sleipnir tapped on it and pushed it away from the small group, letting it expand to cover one wall. The &#039;days since start of loop&#039; number flashed blue, drawing attention.</p><p class="double">“That...” Fenris looked closer. “That&#039;s bigger than I remember it being...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up.</p><p class="double">That in itself was unusual, since she&#039;d gone to bed after the end-of-loop party fully expecting to snap to attention reading a book.</p><p class="double"><i>Razzen-frazzen fused loops...</p><p class="double"></i>And her loop memories were on the fritz, too. How truly good. And <i>not</i> what she needed after that nightmarish loop before last.</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Spike skidded into her room, alarm in his voice. “Get up!”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Twilight rolled out of bed. “And are you actually normal Spike this time, or have I missed some formative event that took place in the past?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight...” Spike said, slowly. “This isn&#039;t a new loop.”</p><p class="double">“Impossible,” Twilight replied bluntly. “Loops have a maximum length.”</p><p class="double">“Well...”</p><p class="double">Spike pointed out the window.</p><p class="double">Trotting over, Twilight shook her head to try to get rid of the inexplicable hangover.</p><p class="double">Then stopped dead.</p><p class="double">The ruins of Pinkie&#039;s “far-too-many-to-bother-counting-loop-end-party” were strewn all over her house, and the square, and half the rest of Ponyville as well. Ponies lay in various states of comatose on the floor, having been thoroughly Partied Out.</p><p class="double">Pinkie was still on a DDR machine.</p><p class="double">“But...” Twilight winced, then remembered enough magic to erase her hangover. (Drinking at the end of a loop wasn&#039;t supposed to make hangovers, so she&#039;d gone a little overboard.) “That&#039;s... how?”</p><p class="double">A clattering of hooves sounded on the balcony, and then Sleipnir came in through the door – causing a little minor structural damage, since he wasn&#039;t quite small enough to fit. “Twilight, good. Sorry for the short notice, I just found that getting rid of that stash of Zeus&#039;s has caused your loop to start expanding to take up the slack. It looks like you&#039;re getting about a week&#039;s worth of new time each stage of expansion... I think.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, so you fixed things too hard?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“Basically,” Sleipnir said with a nod. “Okay, must dash. My siblings and I have to go let the Norns know, and see if this is happening anywhere <i>else.</i>”</p><p class="double">He wheeled on two hooves, strode back up to the balcony, and vanished.</p><p class="double">Spike took a deep breath.</p><p class="double">“...so, what now?”</p><p class="double">“Now,” Twilight said firmly, “I go and find something that hasn&#039;t been drunk yet.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s done...” Twilight said, panting.</p><p class="double">“Giving up the Elements suuuuucks,” Pinkie moaned. “I&#039;m the Element of Laughter! It&#039;s my Thing! Well, that and being a Pink Lantern, but they&#039;re kinda related...”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s got a point, Twi,” Dash said in an unusually subdued tone. “We&#039;re so used to having the powers of the Elements on tap that... well, what does it mean for us?”</p><p class="double">Trixie walked in, dragging a huge mass of burning rosebush-like thorns from her left rear hoof. “That. Was. Not. Fun.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you at least kept the tree contained until we could sort it all out...” Twilight consoled.</p><p class="double">“True. But-” Trixie&#039;s eye twitched, and she flailed her hoof until the woody detritus fell off. “Oh, this is going to give me a <i>complex</i> if it happens every time...”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy brought over some towels and gently cleaned the cuts. Looking up at Trixie, she smiled wanly. “They don&#039;t look too bad. You should be fine – no real need to even use magic to heal them.”</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed. “Well, Trixie will see you next Loop. She understands that this one will not be <i>much</i> longer than normal?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, Sleipnir said something about extending in discrete jumps,” Twilight agreed. “I think there&#039;s about another five days to go for this lot.”</p><p class="double">“Because the Tree of Doom is a <i>perfect</i> way to end a Loop. Alright. <i>Buck</i> keeping a low profile.” Trixie flared her horn, Ascended and flew off.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Wait a moment...”</p><p class="double">The six remaining loopers exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">Then Twilight looked up, mouthed something, and closed her eyes.</p><p class="double">With a flash of violet light, her Element of Magic burst into being on her forehead.</p><p class="double">“Did it work?” she asked, eyes still shut.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Rarity breathed. Then, with another soundless flare, her Element of Generosity materialized.</p><p class="double">Four more followed in quick succession, and then a relieved laughter chased away the last of their anxiety.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“As far as I can tell,” Twilight said, by now on her fourth blackboard of notes, “when the tree was said to require the Elements, it was only after the physical representations – you know, the stone orbs from the Sisters&#039; Castle, or equivalent. But because by now they&#039;re basically part of our souls, they <i>can&#039;t</i> be taken away in any meaningful sense. I should have realized!” She rounded on her audience. “We&#039;ve used this fact <i>so</i> many times before! Every time we&#039;ve conjured the Elements into being to mess with Discord!”</p><p class="double">“So...” Applejack raised a hoof. “What all does this mean for us in a real sense?”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned back to the boards, and made a few more annotations. “I think it means that we need to make a policy of retrieving the solid Elements from the Sisters&#039; Castle every single loop. We can&#039;t really sustain the magic needed to re-actualize the elements if the energy isn&#039;t going back into us once we&#039;re done with them – so we just give the tree the appropriate Elements from the same loop, and we&#039;re golden.”</p><p class="double">“I see,” Fluttershy said. “Thank you for the explanation, Twilight. And – would you and Pinkie be able to join me the next time she, Discord and I are all Awake at the same time?”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight replied. “What for?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes hardened. “I am a kind pony. But I am going to hit him with every form of confection that I can think of until he feels sufficiently sorry for not warning us about that tree in all the time he has had to do so.”</p><p class="double">The others shuffled away from Fluttershy unconsciously.</p><p class="double">“...yeah, sure,” Twilight said, nodding. Then she sat down on a nearby chair. “I hope this kind of thing doesn&#039;t happen every time the timeline extends...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>40.6 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Trixie took in her marefriend&#039;s pacing, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Chrysy.... you&#039;re in a rut.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, I know!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I mean, literally.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen glanced down, blinking. &quot;Oh. When... when did this happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;About half an hour ago.&quot; Trixie hopped down into the ditch, tapping the dirt around her. &quot;I&#039;m amazed it didn&#039;t happen sooner, actually, you&#039;ve been at this for hours.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis flinched at the accusation. &quot;I... I&#039;m trying to steel myself for this, but, but--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you&#039;re frozen by fear and shame and don&#039;t want to cause a confrontation, and every time you push one pillar of your emotions away you get snagged by another.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling gave Trixie a weak smile. &quot;Are you sure you&#039;re not part of the hive mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, I just know what it&#039;s like to be there. Ol&#039; Great and Powerful having to apologize to mares she embarrassed and terrorized...&quot; Trixie shrugged. &quot;Not as personal as your situation, of course, but I&#039;m sympathetic. And I know how hard it can be to do something like this...&quot; She took a breath. &quot;Which is why I want to preemptively apologize.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. &quot;Apologize? I don&#039;t understand, what did--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on, honey, what could be so importaaaaaaaaa.....&quot; Shining&#039;s voice trailed off as he entered the room, his attention fully on the mare who stared back at him in utter horror. He didn&#039;t even notice Cadance&#039;s horn glowing briefly, infusing the tableau with a faint cyan aura. Trixie awkwardly clambered out of the rut, giving the alicorn of love a look; Cadance returned it with a sigh, flicking her eyes at her husband and shaking her head.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Shining Armor cleared his throat. &quot;Soooooooooooo. I, uh, take it you&#039;re looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis managed, barely, to nod.</p><p class="double">&quot;O...kay... Well, um, welcome to the loops, I guess...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis took a breath. &quot;This.... this isn&#039;t my, uh, first loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded. &quot;Yeah, I can see how that could work. Take some time to get acclimatized before.... well, meeting somebody who was basically prey.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I don&#039;t.... well, so long as you don&#039;t do it again, I figure the past is the past.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Yes, quite.&quot; Chrysalis nodded. &quot;Yes! Yes, I&#039;ll not be... invading... again. Nope.&quot; She smiled awkwardly, buzzing out of the ditch and landing. &quot;Um. So, uh... nice to meet you! Heh.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed. &quot;You need to tell him.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor looked toward the magician. &quot;Tell me what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039;s horn flared and she popped out of existence. A moment later she popped back into existence and stumbled into a wall.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anti-teleport field,&quot; Cadance explained, tapping her horn. &quot;Chrysalis, this is for your own good, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen glared at her... then turned her gaze toward Trixie. &quot;You... you planned this!&quot; Her eyes were wide and wet with tears of betrayal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... my plan involved rockets,&quot; Trixie admitted sheepishly. &quot;We went with Cadance&#039;s plan... I, uh, may have a small problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">A shaky hole-ridden hoof rose to point at her. &quot;NO SUPERFUN FOR, FOR A MONTH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining blushed. &quot;Did... did she just pull a List Trotter gambit?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, no. Superfun means explosives,&quot; Trixie explained. &quot;Happyfun means--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think that the point has been made!&quot; Cadance shouted. She took a breath, calming herself. &quot;Chrysalis is very upset that we&#039;re forcing this, even if it is for her own good. Anyway, Chrysalis...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just... just give me a moment.&quot; The ebony mare took a few deep, shaky breaths.</p><p class="double">Shining Armor leaned in toward his wife. &quot;Is... is this some sort of addiction intervention? Has she been draining my non awake selves or something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WE WERE MARRIED, OKAY?!&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis buried her head in her hooves. &quot;We were married, Shiny. For eighteen years, and... and that was my first loop. I thought the baseline was a nightmare because, because I, I couldn&#039;t even think of... I didn&#039;t want to think I could be that cruel. Not after fighting... well, the Celestia of that loop. Not after falling in love and freeing slaves... and... and then I woke up in the next loop and it was all a lie.&quot; She moaned. &quot;There you have it. That&#039;s my big secret. Now just... just go.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining stepped forward. &quot;Um, I--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Leave, all of you. Trixie too.&quot; The queen of changelings sighed. &quot;I.... need to be alone right now...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>40.7</p><p class="double">Celestia carefully unlocked the door to her treasure chamber. “Thank you all for coming,” she said, as the magic released. “I fear that a great evil may have returned, and-”</p><p class="double">She stopped.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked at the ash-strewn ruins within, then she and the others started coughing as thick clouds of smoke erupted out.</p><p class="double">“Dash!” Twilight said, hacking and coughing in the smoke. “Clear this!”</p><p class="double">Dash answered with a pair of wingbeats, thinning the smoke enough to see through, and Twilight added her normal artificial-air-supply spell over the whole group.</p><p class="double">With the smoke clearing, there was a blue glow of magic visible in the air...</p><p class="double">“Trixie?” Rarity, Applejack and Dash asked together.</p><p class="double">“Ah, the Element bearers,” Trixie said, turning. She had Twilight&#039;s Magic tiara on her forehead, and no less than five necklaces on – all the Elements. “Surprised?”</p><p class="double">“Kind of, yeah,” Pinkie said, scratching her head. “I could swear this was supposed to be a <i>new</i> villain...”</p><p class="double">“There probably is.” Trixie tossed her head. “But the security on the Elements was no match for Trixie&#039;s advanced safe-cracking techniques!”</p><p class="double">Twilight sniffed the air, then looked up. “Wait a moment... did you seriously melt a hole in the ceiling?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed!” Trixie answered, pleased. “Iron oxide and Aluminium are excellent tools.”</p><p class="double">“So. Thermite.” Twilight shrugged. “Well, have fun, then.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Celestia asked incredulously, echoed by three of Twilight&#039;s friends. (Fluttershy didn&#039;t say anything, and Pinkie was too busy browsing through a book she&#039;d retrieved from somewhere.)</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed. “Look, if she wants to use the Elements on the new problem, that&#039;s fine.”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s eyes widened. “Trixie might have to <i>use</i> them?”</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah...” Twilight glanced aside at her mentor. “About the only things in history which <i>required</i> the Elements were... ooh... Nightmare Moon and Discord-” Celestia twitched, “and I suspect it&#039;s the latter. So if you want to keep them, keep them – just know that Discord will take them away again in about five minutes.”</p><p class="double">Trixie pondered this for a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“I want to keep the magic one. You can have the rest back.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Celestia said, shocked. “What are you thinking?”</p><p class="double">Twilight stretched. “That it&#039;s my element and I&#039;ll lend it out if I want to, she&#039;s probably the number two magical unicorn in the country, and that I was halfway through a good book. See you guys later.”</p><p class="double">She vanished with a flash.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How&#039;d it go?” Twilight asked, as Trixie walked heavily into the library with her hat askew.</p><p class="double">“Not particularly well,” Trixie admitted. “It looks like the baseline-loop magic show is <i>not</i> compatible with me using the Elements alongside the others. Well,” Trixie waved a hoof. “We got it going eventually. But the palace west wing is probably going to stay as boiled sweets for the rest of the Loop.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight nodded. “Well, it&#039;s good to know this sort of thing. More data points about friendship.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.8</p><p class="double">“Okay. Sure.” Chrysalis nodded. “I can do that. I think.”</p><p class="double">“Could you really?” Twilight asked, smiling. “Thanks. Normally I&#039;d be fine with it, it&#039;s just...”</p><p class="double">She tailed off, then tried again. “<i>That</i> loop.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I get the picture.” Chrysalis shifted to match Twilight&#039;s form... then frowned back along her body. “With wings or without? I&#039;ve lost track of if it&#039;s general knowledge you&#039;re a princess this time.”</p><p class="double">“With.” Twilight winced. “I lost track myself at the loop-start, and Sparkler saw me with them. I told her it was an accident and to keep it secret, which means that only Canterlot high society knows...”</p><p class="double">“Right, right.” More faint green light, and the Twilight-double had wings. “How&#039;s that?”</p><p class="double">“Looks good.” Twilight nodded. “<i>Shrub</i>, but that gala would have been awkward.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure.” Chrysalis turned in place, still looking back along her borrowed form. “Hey, I just noticed. Your hair doesn&#039;t have a... thing.”</p><p class="double">“You mean an aura?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“If I knew what an aura was, then I might be able to answer that...”</p><p class="double">Twilight summoned her element of magic and ascended in the same instant. “This.”</p><p class="double">Slowly, her mane began to glow with a soft orange light. The colour striping along it seemed to blur, slightly, and then become bands of backlit shadow.</p><p class="double">They looked like nothing less than two banks of cloud between sky and land, lit by a sun that had just set below the horizon. The angle of the light changed as she moved, never quite still.</p><p class="double">“...okay, that&#039;s cool.” Chrysalis turned her head on its side. “I think I get it. Twilight, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah...” Twilight shrugged, and then her mane was just coloured again. “It kind of attracts attention, though... and I&#039;m conspicuous enough already with wings.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; copy of Twilight&#039;s mane lit up. “Gah, that&#039;s hard to copy. Can any of the others do that?”</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah...” Twilight answered. “We&#039;re old enough and have enough power. But I usually see them in the more recent Sisters loops, because that way we at least have a reason to use them.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, now I&#039;m curious.” Chrysalis frowned. “Aren&#039;t most of the others awake this loop? I kind of want to see.”</p><p class="double">“...sure.” Twilight went from alicorn to pegasus, then slapped a glamour on herself which made her cutie mark a nebula. “You may as well use the chance to practise being me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>that</i>,” Dash said with a shrug. “Yeah, use it all the time.”</p><p class="double">“You do?” Twilight blinked. “I&#039;d thought it was a rare thing...”</p><p class="double">“Well, sort of, yeah, but who&#039;s going to be able to tell when I&#039;m moving at supersonic speed anyway? Besides, it looks cool.” Dash ascended, then her mane began to...</p><p class="double">Finding words was hard. It was still the same rainbow of colours, and none of them moved, but it was as though one was looking at something going past at extreme speed parallel to the directions of the lines.</p><p class="double">“...that is giving me a headache,” Chrysalis commented absently.</p><p class="double">“Just go with it,” Dash tossed her head, and the colours... reacted after the mane itself, briefly resulting in a mane that was almost entirely red.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said brightly, tapping the facsimile of her shoulder. “Next?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they flew back down to Ponyville, Chrysalis looked Twilight&#039;s glamour over. “That looks fairly detailed. Standard form?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Twilight nodded, backwinging a little. “Starry Nights, a pegasus who goes stargazing on cirrus clouds at night. I made up a few of these one loop, for just this sort of thing.”</p><p class="double">“I approve,” Chrysalis said. “It feels less... impolite, taking a form you have permission for, and invented forms automatically result in permission. I have one who likes collecting rocks...”</p><p class="double">With a clatter of hooves, they landed in front of Carousel Botique.</p><p class="double">“And this is my friend Rarity&#039;s house,” Chrysalis added, knocking.</p><p class="double">After some muffled cursing and a loud <i>splash</i> noise, the door opened on a rather damp Rarity.</p><p class="double">“Oh, come in, Twilight,” Rarity said, her eyes flicking to the pegasus as she said the name. “Who&#039;s your friend?”</p><p class="double">“Starry Nights,” Chrysalis replied easily. “I met her at an astronomy meeting a few days ago.”</p><p class="double">As the door closed again, Twilight nodded to Chrysalis. “Very smooth.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Chrysalis replied with a nod.</p><p class="double">“So, what brings you two here?” Rarity asked, summoning a mop from the back room with her telekinesis and clearing off the floor. “Sorry about this, by the way, my attempt at creating a hat with fish in is still pending a stable but non-stasis containment spell for water in cloth form.”</p><p class="double">“Chrysalis is curious about our mane auras.” Twilight shrugged. “It&#039;s an opportunity to practise being me around town, as well.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that thing.” Rarity rolled her eyes. “That <i>does</i> look nice, but it <i>does</i> also force me into a very limited style of clothing. But I suppose you&#039;d like to see it, of course.”</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s mane aura was, as was becoming a theme, very different to that of anypony else. Where Twilight&#039;s had shone, and Dash&#039;s had flickered, Rarity&#039;s mane... refracted.</p><p class="double">It was see-through, though a deep purple in colour. But what you saw through it didn&#039;t match the edges up with what was visible past it. And when it moved, the whole thing acted like a funhouse mirror and distorted in unpredictable ways.</p><p class="double">“So, there it is,” Rarity said, before undoing the aura and going back to unicorn. “It&#039;s like I&#039;m wearing a giant, flexible gemstone – which doesn&#039;t work well if I want to wear a lot of colours. More colours do well <i>with</i> purple than do well <i>tinted</i> purple, and of course I can&#039;t mute the colouring of it with a well-done hairstyle either.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. “I see. So they... what, they reflect the magical signature of the pony?”</p><p class="double">“Partially,” Twilight replied. “But that&#039;s not the whole story. Let&#039;s go see Pinkie.”</p><p class="double">“...do we have to? I&#039;m still digesting the last Genocide By Toffee, and that was five loops ago...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Ta-da!” Pinkie said, shaking her pink curls. “Like it?”</p><p class="double">“...but that&#039;s just your normal mane-style, isn&#039;t it?” Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. With the air of one doing a magic trick, she ran her hoof along the edge of the mane.</p><p class="double">Some of it came off.</p><p class="double">“Here, try it,” Twilight offered. “It&#039;s delicious.”</p><p class="double">Tentatively, Chrysalis took a small portion with a spoon, and tasted it experimentally.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what.” The disguised changeling pointed, licking the spoon. “Your mane is literally cotton candy.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie beamed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s see...” Twilight said, as they came down to land outside Sweet Apple Acres. “Applejack next, then Fluttershy – Trixie&#039;s there as well, I think, so we can do her too – then we teleport to Canterlot to call in on Shiny and Cadence and finish up with my daughter.”</p><p class="double">“Do we have to do your brother?” Chrysalis winced. “I mean...”</p><p class="double">“I know.” Twilight laid a wing across Chrysalis&#039; back. “If you want, I&#039;ll ask them to do it and you can look in from outside. But they <i>are</i> important.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll-” Chrysalis swallowed. “I&#039;ll give it a go.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the spirit. Oh, hi, Applejack. I&#039;m showing Chrysalis all our mane auras.”</p><p class="double">The farm-pony nodded to both of them. “I&#039;m expectin&#039; you&#039;ll want to see mine, then?”</p><p class="double">“Please.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Applejack stamped on the ground, which produced a ripple and made the nearest field plough itself instantly. “Take a look, then.”</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s alicorn mode was the largest of all the Element bearers&#039;, when shapechanging magic or sheer age wasn&#039;t coming into the equation, and her mane was entirely in scale. After a moment, it took on the slightly unearthly quality which Chrysalis was starting to notice all mane auras had.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s... very yellow, actually,” Chrysalis said, walking all around Applejack. “Or... hold on, is the colour changing?”</p><p class="double">“It cycles through,” Twilight explained helpfully. “Applejack tends not to use hers because it actually changes her colouration – which is very obvious. It goes from yellow to red, then back through yellow to green. Apple colours.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, thank you.”</p><p class="double">Applejack took that as the okay to revert to her base form. “Right, where was ah... oh, yeah. Potatoes.”</p><p class="double">“New thing?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Ah heard th&#039; Prench called &#039;em pommes de terre,” Applejack said over her shoulder. “Worth a try.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That&#039;s really strange,” Chrysalis said, watching the pink shapes move over one another. “Are those butterflies or leaves?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shook her head, causing the shapes to shuffle around more vigorously. “I think it depends how you look.”</p><p class="double">“My turn!” Trixie said, her magic-circlet materializing on her brow. A flash of light, a puff of smoke, and she too was an alicorn.</p><p class="double">“Trixie&#039;s mane is a bit like Fluttershy&#039;s,” Twilight commented. “See the flashes?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t... wait, there we are.” Chrysalis squinted. “Like tiny little fireworks.”</p><p class="double">Trixie spun with a flourish, sending her mane flying out behind her – in a crescendo of bright, multicoloured light.</p><p class="double">“There we go,” Twilight said, smiling. “The faster she moves, the larger the flashes get – and they take on different colours, too.”</p><p class="double">“If only Trixie could get this to work without the wings,” Trixie said sadly. “That would be an excellent magic show.”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to Chrysalis. “Ready?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. “...as I&#039;ll ever be.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, long story short, she&#039;s borrowing my form and she wanted to find out about how alicorn manes work,” Twilight said, keeping an eye on the pair&#039;s reactions.</p><p class="double">“Well, that sounds fine,” Shining said, looking a little uncomfortably at the faux-alicorn. Chrysalis shuffled her wings, and stepped back a bit. “That is <i>so</i> strange... she&#039;s even got your mannerisms down...”</p><p class="double">“The mane?” Twilight prompted.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Shining slipped his hoof into his subspace pocket, touched his spectrum crystal pendant, and flashed through an ascension.</p><p class="double">“Watch this,” Twilight said. Taking a comb from the dresser, she made to comb her brothers&#039; mane.</p><p class="double">With a <i>tink</i>, the comb bounced off.</p><p class="double">“Coherent forcefield,” she said with a wink. “Bit of a pain, though, because stallions find it harder to get away with a useful length of mane.”</p><p class="double">“And as for mine...” Cadence waved a hoof through her mane, which billowed and parted before reforming into the same curls as before. “Try to hold it and it&#039;s as tenuous as smoke. Leave it alone and it always comes back. Sort of like love, really.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, thanks.” Twilight turned to Chrysalis. “Can you teleport us back? Remember the horn aura ultraviolet spell, the fake horn aura spell, and the teleport as well.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Chrysalis frowned. “Let me know if it works.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Yeah, I hardly <i>ever</i> use mine,” Nyx said, looking back at her mane and tail.</p><p class="double">“Why?” Chrysalis asked. “What does it do?”</p><p class="double">“Nothing.”</p><p class="double">“...well, how-”</p><p class="double">“No,” Nyx blew her mane out of her eyes. “Literally nothing. Watch.”</p><p class="double">Mane and tail both went black.</p><p class="double">Completely black. Not just raven-black. Not even coal-black.</p><p class="double">Hole-in-space black. The black of the cold between the stars. So black that your eyes could tell that not a single photon of light was either coming from or being reflected from the hair in question.</p><p class="double">And then Nyx&#039;s mane was back to a dark purple colour.</p><p class="double">“So, yeah,” she said, shrugging. “Depressing.”</p><p class="double">“Right.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sat back to absorb that.</p><p class="double">After a few minutes, another question came to her. “Why are Celestia and Luna so similar, then? In their auras, I mean?”</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s because they&#039;re sisters, and because both of them have talents and magic associated directly with the light of celestial bodies.” Twilight half-spread her wings, then furled them. “I&#039;m not sure, of course, because a lot of this is based on observation, and if you find the definitive book on alicorn magic then please lend it to me as soon as possible.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>41.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, what.”</p><p class="double">Trixie grinned. “Like it? It&#039;s art!”</p><p class="double">Twilight rubbed her forehead with a hoof. “That&#039;s <i>not</i> art. That&#039;s a disaster slowly happening.”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s newest project sat between them. It was a metal framework about two lengths long and one high, with a cloud of finely-divided shrapnel and gas hanging as though frozen around the object inside it.</p><p class="double">“But it&#039;s cool!” Trixie pointed. “See, the lenses have fired, and the compression wave should reach the neutron-reflective core in another few minutes. When it does, the whole of the plutonium will crash through fission in just ten seconds, and-”</p><p class="double">Twilight <i>eep</i>ed. She grabbed the whole device and threw it violently upwards.</p><p class="double">“Awww...” Trixie raised a hoof plaintively towards the hole in the ceiling. “It took me weeks to transmute all that plutonium.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “While your interest in explosives is normally merely dangerous, that was just stupid. But, more importantly-”</p><p class="double">A star bloomed above for a moment.</p><p class="double">“...yeah, that,” Twilight finished. “Pro tip: stasis enchantments set like that may slow down what&#039;s inside them, but the gamma ray effect of the blast destroyed the material on which the enchantments were set in the first place...”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s jaw hung slack.</p><p class="double">“What were you planning to do with it, anyway?” Twilight added.</p><p class="double">“...I really screwed up,” Trixie admitted. “Sorry, Twilight. And I had been planning on putting it in orbit in another few months, but... yeah, that would have gone badly.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I&#039;m sorry, but you really kind of did mess up. Okay, I won&#039;t ask for a friendship report on this one, because Celestia might actually get violent if you tell her you nearly nuked part of the western desert. But I will insist that you use nothing more substantial than a Major Image for the next few loops.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha.” Trixie shook her head, shivering. Then she looked up, forcing a smile. “I suppose I <i>have</i> been relying on brute force a bit...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.2</p><p class="double">“Ah, that&#039;s the stuff...” Spike sighed, finishing off the tumbler of crushed opal in water.</p><p class="double">Just right to cool you off after a long, hot summer day. (Well, if you were a dragon, anyway.)</p><p class="double">Rarity slid onto the stool next to him. “Hello, stranger.”</p><p class="double">“Stranger still,” he replied, turning to her. “Did you escape the ravening horde, then?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, they took themselves off to the lake. Something about going boating.” Rarity shrugged. “They should be fine, they took four sets of that armour I made – with the contingent teleportation spell.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Good to hear. Hey, Mac? Something ponies can drink, large, and two straws.”</p><p class="double">“Coming up,” Mac replied, getting to work.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You four are just <i>nuts,</i>” Nyx said, shaking her head. “And how long did it take you to build these things anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Not important!” Diamond Tiara replied. “Steam up?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Apple bloom nodded, holding up a small stone. “Fire stone – they&#039;re used for camp fires. One large bag under each boiler, and they&#039;ll put out heat until tomorrow morning.”</p><p class="double">As she spoke, steam indeed began to ooze up from the four vessels moored nearby.</p><p class="double">Sweetie hadn&#039;t <i>quite</i> lied when she said they were going boating, when Rarity asked – but the more correct term would be <i>shipping.</i></p><p class="double">Or perhaps not.</p><p class="double">“Right, mine is the<i> Thunder Child</i>,” Tiara said, stepping briskly to the gangplank and walking up.</p><p class="double">The others spread out, heading to their own ships, and Nyx took to the air wearing a large striped referee&#039;s saddle.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Two hours later, as the sun hung past zenith over the deserted archipelago between Equestria and the Gryphon Lands, they were all in position. Each was at the corner of an imaginary square, ten miles on a side.</p><p class="double">Nyx double-checked the cloud solidity effect on her referee&#039;s platform, then fired off the first spell.</p><p class="double">On the bridges of four capital ships, the word “begin” drifted out of the air.</p><p class="double">Sweetie&#039;s <i>Ocean</i> kicked things off, heeling over with the muzzle-horsepower of four 12-inch guns and six 6-inch guns as she fired a volley towards Scootaloo&#039;s <i>Agamemnon.</i></p><p class="double">Then things got quite loud, as all four battlewagons began beating the snot out of one another.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx winced. “Ouch...”</p><p class="double">With a bright flash, Scootaloo appeared next to her. “Aw, that sucks. Apple Bloom&#039;s totally cheating.”</p><p class="double">“How so?” Nyx looked down, at the pillar of smoke marking <i>Agamemnon</i>&#039;s pyre and the other three huge ships dodging and exchanging fire.</p><p class="double">“Her ship&#039;s <i>faster</i> than mine, <i>better armed</i> than mine, and I think she put more armour on it as well.” Scootaloo shook her head. “I saw some of my twelve-inchers splash off the armour.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle appeared in another flash of magic. She landed on the cloud, bounced slightly, and checked with her hoof that it was indeed solid before taking the teleport-strap off. “So much for mine...”</p><p class="double">A loud <i>bang</i> came up to them.</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Scootaloo mused, as <i>Ocean</i> sank in two halves. “Looks like a magazine hit. That ship of &#039;Bloom&#039;s...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tiara&#039;s ship weaved through plumes of water and smoke, taking the occasional hit from the ten huge 12-inchers Apple Bloom was firing in broadside.</p><p class="double">On the bridge, Tiara slammed the enchanted engine-room telegraph to full ahead, checked her positioning, and kicked the torpedo release control with a certain satisfaction.</p><p class="double">Quick-firing guns depressed to shoot at the torpedo sprays, and Apple Bloom&#039;s <i>Dreadnought</i> turned to present a small target to them.</p><p class="double">That was fine by Tiara&#039;s merits. After all, the only place where the torpedoes would miss was-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A final huge explosion rippled the cloud layer.</p><p class="double">Both earth pony fillies appeared within a quarter second of one another, and landed in a heap.</p><p class="double">“Who won?” Tiara demanded, wriggling out from under Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">Nyx frowned. “I think it was probably you, Tiara. I mean, <i>Dreadnought</i> blew up before <i>Thunder Child</i> – if only because you pierced the boiler with the ram.”</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Tiara did a little dance. “Told you it was a useful design!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah...” Apple Bloom huffed. “The torpedo ram <i>is</i> effective under the right circumstances.”</p><p class="double">“Say it!” Tiara demanded.</p><p class="double">“Fine...” Apple Bloom took a breath. “You sunk my battleship.”</p><p class="double">Tiara made a squee sound.</p><p class="double">“So...” Nyx took in the floating wreckage, the three pillars of smoke, and the sinking remains of the last two battlewagons. “Can we get this cleared up before one of the others comes looking for us, or do we hope that the loop resets and removes the evidence before someone notices?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.3 (TheCentauress)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The eight-limbed Spirit Animal trotted over to his Admin Console and looked at his stand-in. &quot;&#039;Zup?&quot; he asked with a happy smile.</p><p class="double">Bastet gave the approaching fellow Admin a hoof/paw/manipulating-appendage/whatever-bump. &quot;Love the group you have here,&quot; she replied to him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh?&quot; he enquired interrogatively.</p><p class="double">The feline-leaning goddess giggled. &quot;Well, see...&quot; she managed around her mirth, &quot;there was this thing... and then...&quot; she gave up and pointed at the terminal.</p><p class="double">The divine equine took a look and saw what was funny...</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight sat there, staring at her paws, trying to figure out <i>what the fluff</i> happened.</p><p class="double">Spike hemmed, hawwed and generally tried to come up with anything. &quot;Ah, you look good as a cat?&quot; the youngling purple dragon finally tried, lamely.</p><p class="double"><i>Thank the Spruce he&#039;s Awake, at least,</i> she mused. &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure this is...&quot; she began before the Loop memories hit. &quot;Urrrk,&quot; she added intelligently, &quot;Great fuzzy yarnballs! Who made this Felinia? Housecats, Kittyhawks and PHASE-cats? Buh-wha?&quot; The last was due to her own feeler-arms unwinding in front of her muzzle in her agitation.</p><p class="double">Spike too one look and headed out the door. &quot;If you need me, I&#039;m going to be drowning my sorrows at the nearest Diamond Dog burrow,&quot; he muttered as the door swung closed.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Sleppnir looked up at Bastet and snickered. &quot;Redo, but their morphic base being feline rather than equine?&quot; He chuckled at her answering bobble-head nod. &quot;Well, they do need to prepare for some of the &#039;odder&#039; non-Eiken stuff, I suppose...” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.4 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Rarity had long ago developed a habit of acquiring samples of intriguing materials whenever she was Awake. As a result, the Carousel Boutique&#039;s basement boasted a rather impressive material science lab and a dwarven magma forge retrofitted to work with alicorn magic. (Also, the Boutique had a basement. A little sorcery went a long way.)</p><p class="double">It was here where Rarity, in pursuit of a goal that had eluded her for countless Loops, discovered that Oerth adamantine and Earth-616 adamantium were far more different than their names would suggest. The former was a pure metal, but the latter was an alloy. Indeed, adamantine was closer to one of adamantium&#039;s ingredients, Vibranium. The two were still distinct from one another, and that was exactly what Rarity had been hoping to find.</p><p class="double">After almost two weeks of near-nonstop metallurgy and countless formulae, Rarity produced a promising sliver of material. It almost sang with stability in her field, even when molten. Once it cooled, it had a curious ocean blue hue, and proved unmalleable by any force of less than continent-shifting magnitude. Thus, the mare proudly dubbed her creation &quot;tectonium.&quot;</p><p class="double">Still, it needed to be put through its paces. Rarity crafted a needle of tectonium and began the battery of tests she&#039;d devised at the start of the enterprise. It went through titanium as easily as through soft cheese. It scratched a diamond like a stylus writing on wet clay. It could even be telekinetically hammered through both of its principal constituents and one of Spike&#039;s larger shed scales to boot, all with minimal wear and tear.</p><p class="double">Rarity beamed. &quot;It&#039;s perfect! I shall get to work straight away.&quot; She began focusing magic into the forge. She&#039;d need much more than a needle&#039;s worth for what she had planned. &quot;But it will all be worth it,&quot; she told herself. &quot;It&#039;s sure to work!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Why! Won&#039;t! You! Work! You! Stupid! Thing!?&quot; With every word, Rarity sent her creation careening through the air and anything else that got in the way.</p><p class="double">As such, Shining Armor kept on the other side of his Canterlot office, well away from the mare. &quot;Rarity, it really isn&#039;t important. I—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is <i>vitally</i> important!&quot; Rarity turned on the stallion, who realized too late how foolish it had been to draw her attention. &quot;I will not, neigh, <i>can</i> not allow Equestria&#039;s sole male alicorn to present himself as anything less than the ultimate gentestallion!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining sighed as he released his aura, his mane and tail reverting from impenetrable force to mundane hair. &quot;So I can comb my mane like this. It really isn&#039;t—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is the <i>principle</i> of the thing!&quot; Rarity ranted. &quot;Celestia does not subject her hoofmaidens to that pink mop of hers. Luna did not permit her mundane locks to remain any longer than necessary. Allowing your mane to be styled at anything less than its full regal splendor is a miscarriage of fabulosity!&quot;</p><p class="double">A unicorn-turned-alicorn mare was ranting at Shining Armor. He could be forgiven for trying to appeal to logic. &quot;That only applies if I&#039;m reigning Prince of Equestria, which has happened all of four times.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you need to be prepared for the fifth! But this useless piece of…&quot; Rarity gave an incoherent scream and threw the tectonium comb at the window. It missed, but went through the wall with minimal speed loss.</p><p class="double">Shining snared it just before it flew out of sight. &quot;You&#039;re lucky nopony was in its path,&quot; he noted as his magic dragged the comb back at a more reasonable velocity.</p><p class="double">Rarity sulked. &quot;I just wanted you to look like a proper prince, is all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, if nothing else, you&#039;ve made one of the most impressive alloys I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot; Shining opened the window to let the comb drift back inside. &quot;I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;d take a commission from the Guard armory?&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a sigh. Rarity didn&#039;t even feel up to summoning a fainting couch. &quot;No thank you. If you&#039;d like, I&#039;ll give you the formula, but…&quot; She groaned. &quot;I was just so sure it would work this time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, if nothing can get through my mane, I&#039;m pretty sure nothing can mess it up, either.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve had bad mane days as an alicorn, Shining.&quot; Rarity shuddered at the memories. &quot;Believe me, you <i>will</i> want some way of dealing with them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining just let his aura come and go in response. &quot;At least I don&#039;t have a pink mop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity did not snort at this. A lady does not snort when she laughs. And she had a row of very sharp teeth on hoof for anypony who might claim otherwise. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.5 (bobnik)</p><p class="double">&quot;... to which I replied, &#039;The clothes aren&#039;t matter.&#039; Of course, with my rusty grasp of Mayan, suddenly Cortez was faced with a nation of nudists when he arrived.&quot; finished Rarity.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle fell off her chair laughing. When Loopers got together to play &quot;What&#039;s the oddest....&quot; the results were either hilarious, tragic or more frequently both.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your turn.&quot; said Rarity. &quot;What&#039;s the oddest thing you&#039;ve ever said that had the furthest-reaching effects?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm. Furthest-reaching? That would be the time I founded a sub-cult of a religion that lasted for ten thousand years.&quot; replied Sweetie. &quot;Hold on a sec, I have to get in costume so you get the full effect.&quot; She hurried into one of the change rooms in the showroom area of Carousel Boutique, and Rarity felt the brief whisper of magic that meant her younger sister was using her subspace pocket. &quot;So did you know I was Awake in the 40K loop when Pinkie ascended?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, really? I hope you didn&#039;t get caught up in all that &#039;eternal war&#039;.&quot; said Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course not, didn&#039;t you hear? Pinkie Pie became an entity that didn&#039;t even have to pretend to obey causality. There was no eternal war. Sure, they started up and then BAM! Orbital party support, Eldar Disco Banshees, Shindigmonettes, the works. So in that Loop I was a Space Marine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Wait, aren&#039;t they always male? That must have been distressing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well yeah. This was fairly early on in the loops for me, and the first time I was male, let alone an adult. Luckily they&#039;re all, well, chemically neutered. So I plain didn&#039;t have to worry about it.&quot; said Sweetie. Her voice became muffled, as if she&#039;d put something on her head. &quot;So there we were start of the Great Crusade. Me and my squad had been given some experimental weaponry and we were part of the pacification force for a world called Lestethes. We landed as per the plan, and started making a base camp, when the scouts report we&#039;re surrounded. Out from cover pops half a million Eldar, and Pinkamena Diane Pie, Festival Incarnate, Warp Goddess of the Eternal Party descended unto us from on high. Then they all yelled &#039;Surprise!&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, yes, classic Pinkie. Even so, it must have been a sight to behold.&quot; Rarity made a circling motion with her hoof. &quot;Go on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So there&#039;s this long awkward silence. The Space Marines of that time had been raised to believe that any alien always was and always would be their enemy. Pinkie&#039;s hair was just starting to straighten out when I decided I wasn&#039;t going to let that happen. I hadn&#039;t been to a Pinkie Party for about fifty years by then, and no way was I going to let this one get away. So I stood up out of cover, fired up the blastmaster, and yelled...&quot;</p><p class="double">At this point Sweetie burst out of the change booth, dressed head to tail in strange pink armour. It had giant shoulder pads, a huge amplifier on the back and a balloon motif repeated all over it. Sweetie reared up on her hind hooves and hoisted a strange guitar looking thing before letting loose her warcry:</p><p class="double">&quot;THIS QUIET OFFENDS PINKIE! THINGS SHALL GET LOUD NOW!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.6 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You are our trusted elites. As such, we have a trusted elite mission for you,&quot; said the tall green floating alien with the red eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a very important mission!&quot; agreed the other tall green alien with the violet eyes that floated alongside the first one, &quot;The important-est kind of mission.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I hear and obey, my Tallests,&quot; Twilight said as her memories of this loop came rushing in. She blinked at the oddness of it all. A check on Elements showed that her friends were all awake, as well as Celestia and Luna. And they were all green aliens. Irkquestrians.</p><p class="double">&quot;To that end, we have crafted specialized SIR robot units for you all,&quot; said Tallest Cel, &quot;Invader Twi, as my personal protigee, I give you this modified SIR unit, codenamed Spike. His specialty is FTL communication.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can also set things on fire with my plasma breath of doom!&quot; A green and purple small metallic robot said as he walked in, adding, &quot;I also eat shiny rocks for fuel. Just thought I&#039;d mention that; hint, hint.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Tallest Lun said while staring at the odd robot, &quot;The new modified SIRs may be a little... quirky, but they are fully functional. FULLY FUNCTIONAL!&quot;</p><p class="double">The royal Irkquestrian voice knocked every alien backwards.</p><p class="double">Tallest Cel continued, unfazed, &quot;Invader Jac, you get the SIR unit codenamed Winona. Specialty is tracking and guidance.&quot;</p><p class="double">The orange eyed invader looked at her new robot. It looked pretty much like every other SIR unit. &quot;Well, howdy, little one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi!&quot; The SIR unit said in a high pitched eager female voice, &quot;I can&#039;t wait to go on this mission. Maybe.. maybe I can even wear a doggy suit?&quot;</p><p class="double">Invader Jac nodded, &quot;We&#039;ll work something out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tallest Cel motioned over the next elite invader, &quot;Invader Rare, you get SIR unit Opal.&quot;</p><p class="double">The all white robot sauntered in and looked over her new mistress, &quot;What can you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll have you know that my weapon designs and invasion plans are the most elegant anywhere,&quot; Invader Rare huffed.</p><p class="double">Opal nodded, &quot;I suppose you&#039;ll do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Invader Shy, since you&#039;re so... timid, we&#039;ve matched you with an appropriate SIR unit, codenamed Angel,&quot; the co-leader said.</p><p class="double">Invader Shy was one of the tallest invaders - which was how they measured status on the planet – but her shy and caring nature was at direct odds to most of the other Irkquestrians. Still, she made for an excellent medic and science officer, &quot;Oh my, he sounds delightful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;His specialty is..,&quot; Tallest Cel was suddenly interrupted when a small SIR unit came through the door - as in ripped right through the advanced metal in a fit of rage. He landed in the center of the aliens, roared, and ripped out a chunk of the floor. He raised it over his head and shook it angrily before biting it into tiny bits with his jagged razor sharp robot teeth.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was wrong,&quot; Invader Shy said quietly, &quot;He&#039;s even more adorable than I thought he would be!&quot;</p><p class="double">Said alien grabbed the omnicidal robot and hugged him in a caring, yet restraining hug while cooing over her new assistant.</p><p class="double">&quot;Invader Pie,&quot; Tallest Lun sighed as said invader appeared suddenly inches in front of her. </p><p class="double">&quot;Yesssss?&quot; said the pink-outfit wearing blue-eyed invader.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here&#039;s your SIR unit, codenamed Gummy.&quot;</p><p class="double">A small greenish robot walked out calmly towards his new mistress.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you like parties?&quot;</p><p class="double">The robot just looked at Invader Pie. His large eye sensors blinked one after the other.</p><p class="double">&quot;Awesome! Let&#039;s have one right now! To the spaceship storage container bin hanger thing! Alien Space Party!&quot; The two vanished in a flash.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Tallest Cel said to the last invader without a robot. She was hovering in the air as well using a makeshift jetpack that was attached to her backpack-like life support unit, &quot;Finally, Invader Dash. You get the one codenamed Tank.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alien leader pointed to the wrecked door. The aliens started at it as nothing came out. A moment passed. Then the wall next to it collapsed as a truly gigantic SIR unit strode in.</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s... so... awesome!&quot; Invader Dash exclaimed and zoomed towards her new assistant.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, my Tallests! My Tallests! I have... a QUESTION!,&quot; Twilight spoke up while gesturing with one upraised fist. She was wondering if everyone in this loop was a giant ham, &quot;What exactly IS our mission?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yeah. That,&quot; Tallest Cel said, &quot;You see, a while back, we sent our most destructive invader to a distant dirt ball named Earth.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We had hoped that the sheer amount of STUPID on that planet would contain him,&quot; Tallest Lun added, &quot;Or at least keep him busy enough not to bother us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s pretty much the definition of containment,&quot; Tallest Cel told her co-ruler.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, we know this. But even still, Invader... ZIM,&quot; the raw anger and loathing at the mere mention of his name was palpable, &quot;managed to destroy a full quarter of our invasion fleet with an out of control MOTILE PLANET!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And even with such looses, it is still an improvement over what he did to our Operation Impending Doom one. So much fire. How crazy is that?&quot; Tallest Cel asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty crazy,&quot; Tallest Lun answered, &quot;Anyway, you six are our elites. So it is up to you to prevent him from causing anymore problems. Do it! Do eeet!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right away, my Tallests!&quot; Twilight hopped on a hovering Spike, and together they took off towards the ship hanger.</p><p class="double">Tallest Cel looked over at her co-ruler, &quot;This is a very strange loop. You think they have a chance?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh? Good question,&quot; Tallest Lun said, &quot;but I don&#039;t care. I&#039;m going to go eat snacks and play video games. Want to join me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And have a vacation loop?&quot; her co-ruler said happily as they floated too into their chambers, &quot;You know it!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Please, Twilight?” Trixie begged.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">“Pleeeease?”</p><p class="double">“No. And no to the next one!”</p><p class="double">“But I have graphs!” Trixie brandished a sheaf of papers. “And calculations! And cited sources and everything!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned. “Okay, go on. Show me your working.”</p><p class="double">“Glad to!” Trixie happily laid the papers on a nearby table and pulled up a chair.</p><p class="double">“This is no guarantee that I&#039;ll let you, remember...” Twilight cautioned.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know...” Trixie shrugged, shuffling the papers. “Right. Here we are. Step one: device scale.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...and finally, step forty-three: the shields are made selectively permeable, permitting target to drop from within the outer shield bubble to the outer world. After this, the remaining contents of the shield are launched on a trajectory straight to the heart of the sun.”</p><p class="double">“Demonstrate the shield marked type IV, please,” Twilight requested.</p><p class="double">Trixie flashed to Alicorn, her wand-device Element on her brow, and <i>focused.</i></p><p class="double">A bubble of darkness bloomed out from a point between them. Twilight directed a half dozen spells at it, followed by a large industrial laser and finally a lascannon.</p><p class="double">None of them so much as got through enough light to see.</p><p class="double">“Right. That seems adequate, so long as the polarization scheme followed in appendix c is followed.” Twilight nodded. “Anchor points?”</p><p class="double">“Shield is anchored to itself, and treats the core of the planet and two nearby mountains as fixed points. The top of the shields are all slightly weaker than one another, ensuring that a vent would be along the line of least potential damage.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight took a deep breath. “Go ahead.”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s grin lit the room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...will last forever!” Nightmare Moon finished.</p><p class="double">Trixie raised a hoof from the audience. “Hay.”</p><p class="double">“You question your liege?” the dark alicorn asked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, just wondering... how do you feel about sunlight in a can?”</p><p class="double">“This has been created?” Nightmare Moon looked a bit unsettled. “Demonstrate.”</p><p class="double">“Since you asked so nicely...” Trixie levitated a large metal cylinder over. The top of it&nbsp;&nbsp;was peaked, and it massed about as much as a torso.</p><p class="double">“How is this operated?” the alicorn queried.</p><p class="double">At that point, Trixie activated some shield layers. Layers one, two and three were around the object at close range, enclosing it at a radius of about four feet.</p><p class="double">Layers four to six were around the object, Nightmare Moon, and a little of the stage.</p><p class="double">Letting her illusion fade, Trixie revealed her wings and shining Element. “A spark shall awaken them.”</p><p class="double">“What? Treachery!” Nightmare Moon&#039;s voice came oddly muffled by the shield layers. “What sorcery encloses <i>me</i> in darkness?” There was a crackle. “My teleportation is hampered! Release me at once!”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t look directly at the blast,” Trixie quipped. “Initiation of device in two, one...”</p><p class="double">From outside, there was an almost anticlimatic flash, a little like a lightbulb burning out.</p><p class="double">As per her meticulous action plan, the showpony allowed a badly singed Nightmare Moon to fall through the bottom of the shield before carefully disposing of the rest of the contents. In the sun.</p><p class="double">“That, basically,” she said with a nod. “I&#039;ve got fun size packs, too.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Out of curiosity, how are you going to make sure that an atomic artillery shell will still initiate around Discord?” Twilight asked, watching with some trepedation as Trixie refreshed a device core.</p><p class="double">Inside an antiradiation shield, of course. Trixie wasn&#039;t stupid. Sometimes.</p><p class="double">“Not sure,” Trixie admitted. “I did think of painting it green, because that way if it fails at least I&#039;ll turn into The Hulk or something.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.8 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight awoke next to Applejack as they both sat around a large utilitarian table. The gunmetal gray walls and sparse decorations indicated that they were on board a ship - possibly a spaceship or submarine of some sort.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Applejack said, &quot;this all doesn&#039;t seem too bad, I recon. The memories should be retur.. oh, HAY NO!&quot;</p><p class="double">The orange pony&#039;s eyes widened even as her pupils shrunk. Twilight shortly knew why when the memories hit.</p><p class="double">Her and the element of honesty were brought on as consultants. Apparently a new pony mining colony had stopped reporting in. Applejack was to check on the status of the terraforming process, ecosystem, and tectonic stability; while she was there to help if any other more esoteric problems show up.</p><p class="double">They had just achieved orbit.</p><p class="double">And the cause of Applejack&#039;s problems, the captain of the ship and leader of the contingent of marines, had just walked into the room - flanked by ten more of the armored marine troops.</p><p class="double">The heavy armor somewhat resembled a mechanical centaur - with a large pony-style body with hard points that held an assortment of very heavy weaponry. The arms were long metallic tentacles that culminated in three long manipulator tendrils that could easily grasp around a pony&#039;s head. And in middle of the body, where the torso and head should have been; was a giant water-filled orb.</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome all you happy campers,&quot; marine captain Sealight merrily exclaimed from inside her orb. Twilight could make out that besides the grinning captain, there was also a tiny little castle and fake treasure chest on the bottom of it, &quot;I&#039;m sure this mission will be so much fun! Two weeks ago, the colony of Oreagon 12 stopped sending out any news or progress reports, so Princess Celestia called upon us seapony marines to look into it. We also have fun ponies Twilight Sparkle and Applejack to help us find out what happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a chorus of wet splashing sounds as all the marines did the seapony version of applause. Applejack&#039;s eye started twitching. Twilight examined the captain. She was the same shade of lavender as herself, but her mane was pale pink in color. The unicorn wondered if the reason seapony armor had so many limbs was because, not having any of their own, the seaponies were fascinated by them.</p><p class="double">The captain turned towards Celestia&#039;s student and continued, &quot;Miss Twilight, can you please scan the colony too see how many ponies are there, playing a rousing game of hide and seek no doubt.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right,&quot; Twilight said as she concentrated on a scrying spell. The distance to the planet from the ship was no great obstacle for her, &quot;Hold on. let me double check the results.&quot;</p><p class="double">The results came back the same. Twilight replied sadly, &quot;There&#039;s only one pony still down there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you could, please bring that pony up to the ship so they won&#039;t be lonely anymore,&quot; Sealight requested.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded and one burst of teleportation later, a dirty earth pony filly was suddenly crouched on the table. A quick calming spell stopped the screaming.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there! What&#039;s your name?&quot; Sealight asked, &quot;Do you know what happened to all the other ponies?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, my name is Newt. And the other ponies... there were these horrible monsters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Righty then. High Tide, if you can please take our new friend to a sleepy room?&quot; the captain waited until a yellow seapony in a giant robot suit led the little pony out of the meeting hall before turning to Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Already verified,&quot; Twilight interrupted. Her last scrying spell revealed creatures which she had heard about, but fortunately, not encountered before personally. She still couldn&#039;t help but be upset at the fates of the colonists, &quot;It&#039;s like she said. The place is full of horrible monsters. I don&#039;t think there is any way to befriend them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Without Fluttershy,&#039; Twilight added in her own mind.</p><p class="double">Sealight nodded and spoke into her intercom, &quot;You all heard the little filly. Nothing down on the planet but horrible non-befriend-y monsters. The poor things must be tired of always crawling around in the dark and gloom. Let&#039;s give them all a little sunshine to play with!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle and Applejack sat transfixed as a monitor showed a missile streaking down towards the surface colony before exploding in a titanic blast.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah! That&#039;s it! Game over, for you!&quot; gleefully exclaimed another seapony marine. The name tag read &#039;Suds on&#039;.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, campers, a new game has just begun,&quot; Sealight said, &quot;It appears this ship is full of happy sunshine missiles. And if we don&#039;t use them all this year, Queen Marina won&#039;t let us have new shiny ones to play next year. So we&#039;re going to turn this planet into a smooth glowy marble. Smooth marble planets are the best!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a large amount of cheering from the seapony contingent.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I recon that since the planet don&#039;t have no ecosystem any longer, that my job here is done,&quot; Applejack stood up on shaky legs, &quot;If you all need me, I&#039;ll be hiding in my bunk.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just sat and watched transfixed as the missiles rained down.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Hello again, happy campers. Captain Sealight here once again,&quot; Twilight looked up from her book when she heard the voice over the intercom. She had been in her bunk for the last day, feeling the ship rumble every time a missile was launched. This was followed by the cheers of the seaponies - as if they were watching a giant fireworks show. Applejack hadn&#039;t left her locked cabin in all of this time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Our resident tactical science pony, Sea Star, has expressed some concerns that some of the space monsters may be hiding deep inside the planet and had not seen any of our shiny gifts. To remedy this, we have sent them a few planet crackers, delightfully wrapped and complete with a greeting card. If you look out your windows, you can all see how a new asteroid belt is made. This is captain Sealight, wishing every pony a super fun day! Shoo bee doo!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shoo, shoo bee doo!&quot; came the chorus of answering voices of the seapony marines.</p><p class="double">Twilight debated whether or not to observe the spectacle. Since her friend&#039;s cabin was right next to hers, Twilight asked Applejack if she would watch, but all she heard back through the wall was a muffled, &quot;Eenope. Nope nope nope nope nope.&quot;</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Shoo bee doo, all you happy campers,&quot; came the captain&#039;s voice from the intercom, &quot;As you all know, we have spent the last week in this system by playing the super fun &#039;let&#039;s drag the largest parts of the former planet and toss them into the sun&#039; game. But as all good times tend to do; this one has to come to an end for now. So with that, I&#039;d like to announce that we will finally be leaving this place and heading back home.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought she heard a faint &quot;Finally!&quot; from Applejack&#039;s cabin.</p><p class="double">&quot;So without further ado, &#039;The Sealaco&#039; will be exiting the system going into hyperspace,&quot; Sealight&#039;s voice said, adding, &quot;Right as soon as we blow up the sun. It&#039;s the only way to be sure. This is Captain Sealight saying &#039;shoo bee doo&#039;, every pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, are you all right?&quot; Twilight worriedly asked at the wall dividing their cabins. But all she heard was faint muffled whimpering.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.9 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">An alicorn, a showmare, a changeling, and a guard captain all went bowling together.</p><p class="double">There had been a bit of a kerfluffle, of course, when Cadance had announced the idea. But she had gone on to explain that right now the relationship between her and Chrysalis basically boiled down to &quot;I got him and you didn&#039;t&quot; which wasn&#039;t healthy for either side, and that was on top of the whole.... thing, between Shining and Chrysalis.</p><p class="double">&quot;But why bowling?&quot; Trixie asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I like bowling,&quot; Cadance replied. &quot;Not everything I like is about love and weddings.&quot;</p><p class="double">So here they were, all in bowling shoes and ponytailed manes, studiously oblivious to the freaking out of the citizens around them.</p><p class="double">&quot;STRIKE!&quot; Cadance shouted with a huge smirk. &quot;Three in a row!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rolled her eyes. &quot;Don&#039;t count your eggs before they hatch. You just have an early winning streak, that&#039;s all.&quot; She took her own ball and slipped it down the lane, grinning as the pins went down. &quot;See? Not hard at all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, this might actually be a challenge!&quot; Cadance giggeld. &quot;Shining, it&#039;s your turn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, yeah....&quot; The stallion stood up, grabbing a ball and lazily slinging it it down the lane. &quot;...A seven split. Okay, sure.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie rolled her eyes. &quot;You&#039;re not very good at this, are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really, no....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.10 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke as she normally did at the beginning of a loop in her room in Canterlot, but something was off. She took a look around as she waited for her loop memories to kick in. The most obvious was the honkin huge brass telescope she was perched beneath. Subtler details, like the Jakehoof&#039;s Ladder and Van Der Giraffe generator told her she was living, not in a library, but in a mad scientist&#039;s labratory.</p><p class="double">In fact, it kinda reminded her of that one loop where everypony suddenly got interested in Contraptionlogy, only this time she wasn&#039;t a disembodied brain up against the Great and Powerful Robo-trixie.</p><p class="double">Her loop memories confirmed it. One of her fondest memories had been when she had won a mentorship from Director Celestia herself with her egg laying machine. Granted, the fact that the machine had gone rogue and tried to eat the judges and her parents had been a bit of a dark spot, but it had turned out happily in the end.</p><p class="double">In fact, one of the subjects of that memory was walking through the door right now, carrying a tray with a teapot and cups on it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, old bean, you&#039;re awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, I&#039;m awake Spike, I&#039;m always awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That not what I saw earlier, when I saw you hunched over the astonoscope.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;So, Spike&#039;s not Awake this loop&#039; She paused and continued speaking.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike, can you take a letter for Director Celestia?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right-o!&quot; He moved to the single writing desk in the room and removed a piece of paper and grabbed a quill in claw, waiting for her to speak.</p><p class="double">&#039;Thats certainly an odd anachronism. Quill and ink, but mad science everywhere else.&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Director Celestia,</p><p class="double">As you know, I&#039;ve been observing the moon&#039;s surface these past few weeks and the increased activity there leads to be to believe that your sister plans to make a rather violent return after her 10 yr banishment. I humbly suggest mobilizing every able-bodied mare and stallion to meet her and whatever forces she&#039;s mustered.&quot;</p><p class="double">You&#039;re faithful pupil,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike rolled up the letter, placing it in a glass and metal tube and inserting that tube into a pipe, one of many that ran along the wall, where it was sucked away with a whoosh. A few minutes later, another tube returned through another pipe, somersaulting and landing in Spike&#039;s waiting claws. He opened the tube and unfurled the letter inside and began reading.</p><p class="double">&quot;My Faithful Pupil, Twilight,</p><p class="double">I&#039;m well aware of my sister&#039;s return, and have put in motion plans to counter her. However, for the moment, I&#039;d like you to go to Ponyville and look over the preparations for the Summer Sun Conference. And for heavens sake, please try to make some allies there.</p><p class="double">Your mentor,</p><p class="double">Director Celestia&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I suppose that went as well as could be expected.&quot;</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">41.11</p><p class="double">“O-kay, here we go.” Scootaloo kricked her neck one way, then the other. She itched to shake her wings out, getting them ready for what she knew was coming, but the dress didn&#039;t permit it.</p><p class="double">“Whoa, Scoots, we&#039;re just bridesmaids...” Applebloom said. “And ah don&#039;t appreciate you getting&#039; us all into this! We could be-”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo cut her off. “What if we get a cutie mark from it? This is a thing to try I don&#039;t think we&#039;d get another chance at!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” Sweetie said, nodding. “It&#039;s not very often that ponies we know get married.”</p><p class="double">“Right!” Scootaloo grinned. “So we&#039;ll be the best bridesmaids ever, so we get cutie marks for it!”</p><p class="double">“CUTIE-”</p><p class="double">“Sssh!” Rarity said, holding a hoof over her mouth. “We don&#039;t want to drown out the music, do we?”</p><p class="double">“Sorry...” the trio muttered. Then Scoots cocked her head. “Hey, I can hear it!”</p><p class="double">Sweetie nodded, her ears pricked to the faint strains of classical music.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo hid a smile, knowing that Sweetie most often got her mark for music or music related things.</p><p class="double">But it would be cheating to tell her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...speak now or forever hold your peace.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo perked up. This was about when things usually got interesting.</p><p class="double"><i>Mind Fog.</i></p><p class="double">“Thanks,” she whispered to Pansy. The spell in question would keep her emotions masked, because from now on they might start to get suspicious.</p><p class="double"><i>You are welcome,</i> the ersatz Device replied quietly.</p><p class="double">About then, a large door at the other end of the courtyard exploded.</p><p class="double">As flaming cinders and balks of gate timber crashed to the ground, the smoke eddied to reveal a unicorn wearing a cape.</p><p class="double">“I object!” Trixie shouted.</p><p class="double">“On what grounds?”</p><p class="double">“On what grounds?” Trixie stepped forward, slowly and deliberately. “On what grounds?”</p><p class="double">She gestured dramatically. “On the grounds of Canterlot Castle!”</p><p class="double">“Technically,” Twilight&#039;s voice came from behind Trixie, “we&#039;re not actually on the grounds. This is surrounded by buildings which aren&#039;t the curtain wall and which are connected to the castle itself – so we&#039;re in the castle.”</p><p class="double">“Despite the fact we can see the sky overhead?” Trixie asked, turning to face Twilight as she emerged from the smoke.</p><p class="double">“Yep.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that doesn&#039;t make much sense...”</p><p class="double">“Was there a point to this?” Celestia asked, frowning down at the two unicorns.</p><p class="double">“Indeed!” Trixie said loudly. “No fewer than seven! Firstly, and most importantly of all, this so-called fake knockoff Princess Cadence is Chartreuse. Everypony knows that the real one is a slightly duskier shade.”</p><p class="double">“Do we?” several ponies in the audience muttered.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t see it myself,” one donkey said, looking at the bride. “But then, how&#039;d I know? I haven&#039;t seen her before.”</p><p class="double">“I certainly don&#039;t know what you mean...” Shining said, glancing across the aisle then shrugging.</p><p class="double">“Well, of course you wouldn&#039;t, you&#039;ve been brainwashed, keep up!” Trixie slammed a hoof on the floor. “Second, which is an auspicious number, there is the matter of the hairstyle.”</p><p class="double">As Trixie began a long lecture on hair stylage as it related to alicorns, occasionally interrupted by Twilight correcting her on a minor point, Scootaloo just began shaking her head.</p><p class="double">“What in tarnation is goin&#039; on?” Applebloom whispered. “How long do we have to hold this dress up?”</p><p class="double">“Dunno,” Scootaloo admitted.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear,” Rarity said quietly from her bench near the front. The three fillies all listened intently. “I do hope Twilight gives up this silly notion of hers before the whole hour is up...”</p><p class="double">“We might have to hold it for an hour?” Sweetie said, eyes wide. “This is the worst thing ever!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And thus, do I conclude that the nature of the magic of the alicorn known as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is of the hue normally defined as &#039;pink&#039;, whereas the magic which has been witnessed upon this very day by my able compatriot Twilight Sparkle is a colour more normally known as &#039;green&#039;.”</p><p class="double">“Are you done yet?” Celestia asked, her eyes half closed. Most of the guests were snoring.</p><p class="double">“Almost!” Trixie set off a spell which produced a loud bang, jerking the guests back to wakefulness. “Seventh and last, we found the real one in a mine.”</p><p class="double">The smoke cleared.</p><p class="double">Several dozen ponies started kicking themselves that they hadn&#039;t noticed how unusual it was for a dramatic smoke cloud to linger for a full hour.</p><p class="double">And, through the wreckage that had once been a gate, stepped the real Princess Cadence.</p><p class="double">Celestia stared. “You couldn&#039;t have mentioned that first?”</p><p class="double">“I was having fun,” Trixie admitted. “Anyway. So. Imposter?”</p><p class="double">Hundreds of changelings dropped shapeshifts.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go,” Scootaloo said to herself as the wedding dissolved into chaos.</p><p class="double"><i>Set up. Fog cloud.</i></p><p class="double">An instant fogbank bloomed around the three Crusaders.</p><p class="double">“Stay with me, girls!” Scootaloo called, reaching out to the fog and gripping it with her weather magic. Then shaping it, so it compressed into solid objects.</p><p class="double">Normally this would take one hay of a lot of mental effort. When she was Bronze Wing, the occasional Jewel Scouts loops, the most she could manage even with the fuku-armour was a weapon and a hoplon-style shield.</p><p class="double">Of course, back then she hadn&#039;t had Pansy either.</p><p class="double"><i>Set up complete. Preparing to lock cloud forms.</i></p><p class="double">Cloud compressed into a suit of close-fitting armour, then flashed yellow.</p><p class="double"><i>Locked.</i></p><p class="double">A pair of shield, formed like bucklers and looking like they were made of bronze.</p><p class="double"><i>Locked.</i></p><p class="double">And, finally, a two-length staff.</p><p class="double"><i>Locked and ready.</i></p><p class="double">Rearing up on her hind legs, Scootaloo spun the staff around twice. Once at a low level, tripping two changeling mooks trying to close in on them. Then again, slightly higher, clouting them both on the head and knocking them senseless.</p><p class="double">“Whoa!” Sweetie Belle and Applebloom chorused.</p><p class="double">“Since when could you do that?” Applebloom added. “That&#039;s awesome!”</p><p class="double">Crouching down, Scootaloo slipped her staff under a changeling&#039;s body barrel and lifted... it? Him? Bodily into a stun spell from the dense pattern weaving out from Twilight.</p><p class="double">“A griffin showed me once – when you two were with your sisters, some time ago.” Scootaloo shrugged. “She was neat.”</p><p class="double">“What, the cloud shaping thing?”</p><p class="double">“Mostly.” Scootaloo intercepted a spell bolt headed for Applebloom, backing towards a corner with them behind her. “Hey, &#039;bloom? Punch any that get past me, okay?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.”</p><p class="double">Her staff glowed green, as a changeling got the idea to take her weapon away from her.</p><p class="double">It disappeared in a puff of cloud as Pansy released the magic maintaining it.</p><p class="double">More fog oozed from the Device, which Scootaloo quickly crafted into a shorter stick. With this, she clonked the enterprising changeling on the forehead.</p><p class="double">“Sooo cooool...” Sweetie Belle said with glee.</p><p class="double">In the distance, they heard Trixie&#039;s voice shouting something about “stun danmaku”.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.12 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">X-Communication</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">One explanation later, James was sitting there, rubbing his chin. &quot;I see, you do have a problem. But why did you come to me? Not that I&#039;m complaining. I like a challenge.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I read your article on the Meta law board of the Space law forum, &#039;The rights of an alien.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">The lawyer gave a lopsided frown. &quot;But my conclusion was that a non-human, even a sentient being capable of everything a human is, did not have any rights under any legal code, because every code assumes that &#039;sentient being&#039; and &#039;human&#039; are identical terms. Basically, they are considered a wild animal, no matter what degree of intelligence they show. Weren&#039;t you offended?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The fact offends me, but it&#039;s a natural consequence of you being the only intelligent race on your planet...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sometimes I wonder about that.&quot; James shook his head ruefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Taking offence at you because you explained it in a clear and well thought out manner, that&#039;s just silly. It got me to researching your background. First from Cambridge, several years at Conham and Perks, one of the biggest and most prestigious law firms in your country, amateur science fiction writer and frequent poster on boards dealing with space law and metalaw... I just have one question, why leave to start up your own business?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Call me an idealist, or crazy,&quot; he grinned. &quot;I needed time with an existing law firm to tick the boxes for my own professional development, but most of what I was doing was corporate legal work. I became a lawyer to help people get fair treatment under the law, not to help them figure out ways to evade it.</p><p class="double">&quot;There was this one case where an oil company was going to buy some second hand tankers that weren&#039;t fully up to modern operating standards, rather than springing for new safer ones. Ultimately it would cost them more in maintenance and operating costs, not to mention the costs of the inevitable accidents, but those wouldn&#039;t show on that year&#039;s operating statement, and affect the directors bonuses. Our job was to figure out how to limit their liabilities, basically ensure that when something did go wrong, they&#039;d suffer as little as possible.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that it was all like that, or even mostly, but there were a couple of times I really didn&#039;t enjoy what I was doing. So I put in my time, made contacts, did the best job I could, and left as soon as I could scrape together the money.&quot; He made a gesture around the room. &quot;I don&#039;t make anything like as much money, but I sleep better at nights, and I get to help real people, rather than faceless corporations.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The problem is, while I&#039;m real enough, I&#039;m not a person.&quot; Twilight pulled a high end tablet/laptop from her saddlebag and placed it on the desk.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not going to be easy to change that, especially not in the current social climate... Where did you get that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I bought it, or at least paid money for it. I should have said, I had some gold coins with me in a sub-space pocket when I was shifted here. I teleported into a bank vault at night and exchanged some for legal currency, then I went and did the same at various shops, listing and paying for what I took. It&#039;s not like I could walk up to the counter during normal working hours, I&#039;d cause a riot. I mean, if I didn&#039;t have local money, how would I be able to pay for your services?&quot; Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;That is still technically breaking and entering, even if you didn&#039;t break anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not a person, remember? I can do wrong, but I can&#039;t commit crimes. Just crossing national borders without the right visas or a passport is illegal. But no-pony asks a migrating bird for their papers. And I&#039;m not on the list of animals that need a six month quarantine to enter the UK, so I&#039;m good there too. Not that I intend to use the loophole to do anything immoral or hurt anyone, it&#039;s just in my position, I have to take advantage of whatever I can to accomplish my goals.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And those goals are?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;First, build a way to get home. To be honest, I could just squirrel myself away somewhere in the wilderness or on a near Earth asteroid and set up an alchemical forge to produce the needed materials without ever interacting with humans again. But my second goal is to help out. Partly it&#039;s because you guys need it, even without the recent alien invasion. Not that I&#039;m saying what you&#039;ve accomplished on your own isn&#039;t amazing, but there are ways I can help without detracting from that. Also, I want to prove to those X-Com guys and everyone that Equestrians are not like those invaders you&#039;ve been dealing with. Aliens aren&#039;t automatically evil.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;However, without a legal identity you have one foot... hoof in a bucket.&quot; James mused as the tablet powered up. &quot;I assume this has your - oh, yes the obvious solution. That&#039;s kind of embarrassing, after I railed at big corporations.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, from what I&#039;ve read, a corporate entity can be set up to any end, and is a legal individual. I was thinking two actually, a private limited company to manage business investments, and a non-profit charity to funnel the profits into worthy causes. Have I got this right?&quot;</p><p class="double">The lawyer looked it over. &quot;Hmm... in rough, there are things I&#039;d have done differently, and things you&#039;ve missed out, but overall a good effort. You have legal training yourself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As Princess Celestia&#039;s protégé I studied the basics of Equestrian law, and I did some study in university libraries and on the internet over the last couple on nights, but that doesn&#039;t make me a lawyer especially in human law. However, I should be able to follow what a specialist says.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gestured to James with a hoof. Of course, she didn&#039;t tell him that she was a fully trained lawyer in multiple jurisdictions, because those had all happened in other loops and therefore didn&#039;t count. She&#039;d deliberately held her input to what could be expected from a relative novice, including a couple of minor mistakes. </p><p class="double">There may have been things she&#039;d actually missed, too... common law precedent could get annoying.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and the lawyer discussed what she intended to do with the organisations she was going to set up, which they decide to call Nightlight Industries and the Nightlight Foundation. The tagline was &#039;Better to light a candle&#039;, and the logo Twilight had designed using the laptop&#039;s graphics tool was a stylised conical candle, which if you squinted looked a lot like a unicorn horn.</p><p class="double">At the end James chuckled. &quot;So Nightlight Ltd will be going into the salvage business. Oh, this is going to be interesting! I&#039;ll need around £50,000 to get things rolling. Thankfully, the registration fees for setting things up aren&#039;t too bad. Fortunately you don&#039;t need one of the expensive slots. I can get some more of your gold, or some smaller gems exchanged to cover it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How long will it take you to organise?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;A couple of days. I do have other work to complete, and i can&#039;t abandon my other clients no matter how much fun this project will be. However, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, almost everything can be done via internet forms. I can hand off the details to my assistants. Of course that will mean I&#039;ll have to tell them everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;That&#039;s fine. It&#039;s not like they&#039;re not already eavesdropping at the door...&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a thump and a crash, followed by a pained &#039;ouch&#039;.</p><p class="double">James&#039; good mood evaporated instantly. &quot;No! I am so sorry! They know better than break client confidentiality, and I intend to remind them of it. How did you... oh, some sort of spell?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually I didn&#039;t until the noises. But it was a logical deduction.&quot; Twilight giggled, then sobered. &quot;Please, don&#039;t be hard on them. They were probably only listening because they were worried about you being in the same room as a monster from outer space. They were most likely ready to rush in here to rescue you at the first sound of trouble. Not that I can think of anything useful they could have done, but that just makes it more impressive. It&#039;s clear they consider you a friend, as well as a boss.&quot;</p><p class="double">James looked slightly embarrassed at the compliment. &quot;Yes, well... Let&#039;s go and discuss your plan with my overly protective employees, and get things moving.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>X-Com had calmed down in the last couple of days after mission Bring Night, but it was a tense sort of calm. There had been no further alien attacks, and nothing more from their current bête noire, Sparkle. Despite their best efforts, they still hadn&#039;t eradicated the video of Sparkle from the internet, or the many derivations with everything from Guile&#039;s Theme to Gurren Laggan incorporating the footage. Even the debunking of it as a CGI publicity stunt hadn&#039;t stopped it, and Commander Benford had censured further action against the spa or the originator, Kimiko Mizuno, as the damage was done, and doing so would simply attract more attention to her and neutering what little effect the countermeasure had.</p><p class="double">Currently he was in Command Central, looking up at the holo-globe, and wondering where in the world Sparkle was, and what she was planning.</p><p class="double">&quot;Commander, we&#039;ve got a problem!&quot;</p><p class="double">One of the monitoring techs looked up and he immediately activated his headset. &quot;What do we have?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not alien activity, at least not normal alien activity. NASA Orbital Debris Tracking reported it, and it&#039;s confirmed. Every tracked piece of debris within 1400 miles of Earth is moving, accelerating!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What about our satellites? The ISS? Are there any impacts?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not affected, we&#039;ve asked for reports from various other government and commercial tracking stations, so far not a single active satellite has been affected by this force, or hit by the affected objects. Only the debris, though we&#039;re getting reports that natural astrolites are affected too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is there a pattern?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re working on it!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was a tense half hour as the operations staff collated the data from the X-Com satellite net and dozens of other government and commercial satellite tracking stations, most of whom didn&#039;t even realise they were contributing to the effort. However, a pattern was emerging. Everything which wasn&#039;t an active satellite had been yanked out of it&#039;s orbit and hauled away.</p><p class="double">The holo-globe now displayed the new configuration of the junk, and clearly showed a pattern forming. Doctor Vahlen was summarizing the results her teams had been analysing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Everything below the 1000 kilometre height accelerated upwards, and at peak velocity was making around 50 kilometres per second, exceeding solar escape velocity. Similarly the objects above were driven down at similar velocities. Only debris was targeted, and there were three detected cases where a piece of debris was likely to intercept an active satellite, only to swerve at the last minute to pass by in the lee of their orbital track.</p><p class="double">&quot;That alone would indicate some intelligent agency controlling events, one which is able to detect and control every object within two thousand kilometres of Earth&#039;s surface in real time. What happened next is even more disturbing. On approaching the 1000 kilometre boundary, all these objects did a right angle turn to head towards a single point in Equatorial orbit. What is more,they started to slow down as they approached the coalescence point, and appear to have accreted into a body estimated to be around eighty metres in diameter and weighing around 5000 tons, based on the estimated amount of debris in those orbits.&quot;</p><p class="double">She shook her head. &quot;Objects in space don&#039;t swerve, and they most certainly do not make right angle turns! I would suspect this to be some telekinetic trick of Sparkle&#039;s, except that I can not conceive of any being that could keep track of so many objects, let alone accelerate thousands of tons at accelerations an air to air missile would be hard pressed to match. The very concept is terrifying.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen found himself in agreement with Vahlen, a rare occurrence. &quot;It took the processing power of our entire computer system and dozens of stations all over the world to just track the objects, and even then we had to rotate between groups to handle the data. A dedicated system could be built to handle the data, but it would need to be several times the power of our present system. </p><p class="double">&quot;However, whoever did it also did us a massive favour. At a best guess, over 90 percent of all the orbital debris around Earth and almost everything in low earth orbit has been swept away. The dangers of a collision have been reduced to almost nothing. As to moving the debris, Elerium could provide the power, but projecting and controlling it as some sort of tractor beam - the aliens use gravity control, but our own research hasn&#039;t even started to explore that sort of application. I find it fascinating.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well someone has.&quot; Commander Benford stated, looking up at the dot which now circled the translucent globe. &quot;We should be able to get a closer look, the US Department of Defense has sacrificed the station keeping fuel in one of their Keyhole observation satellites to put it into an orbit with an apogee that should take it above the object by a dozen miles at it&#039;s closest approach. We should be getting a feed soon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Vahlen poke up. &quot;With your permission Commander, I shall set up close monitoring of the satellite as it approaches the object. The deviation in its orbit may give us a better read of the mass. We have the details?&quot;</p><p class="double">As she set up her tracking watch, a video window opened up in front of the globe, showing a black sky, and a green illuminated date stamp and time as well as figures around the edge that showed attitude and orbital characteristics, all changing as they watched. &quot;We have satellite feed sir! They&#039;re bringing it around to align the primary optic on the object.&quot;</p><p class="double">A large grey white dot appeared on the edge of the display, and drifted towards the centre. It was too distant to see any details, but it definitely showed as a shape. When it reached the centre of the aiming reticules, it came to a halt. It seemed to explode outwards, and a magnification number that sat in the top left of the screen spun up.</p><p class="double">It now filled the central portion of the screen, a rugged mass of detritus, with several upper rocket stages lined neatly along one face, and a number of physically intact satellites suspended around it like a halo. There was also a small blob of purple that was the only moving object on the surface. The camera zoomed in again to show it clearly, and Vahlen gave an actual growl of frustration.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, apparently unprotected from the rigours of space, was picking her way over the variegated surface, carrying a number of objects along with her in a purple grip. The smallest, in front of her was possibly some sort of tablet computer from the glow, while the objects flanking her were a slightly larger box that appeared to have come from inside one of the satellites. The third was more mysterious, a large crystal prism, as large as she was, with some sort of golden pattern on it&#039;s surface.</p><p class="double">She suddenly stopped, turning her attention from the computer screen and looked up. She stared directly at the camera then gave a cheery wave with a hoof before going back to her work. The box was set in place on a large plate and welded there by a brief arc from her horn. She returned her attention to the computer, and although she didn&#039;t apparently do anything, one of the techs called out, &quot;We&#039;re getting a signal!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What does it say?&quot; Commander Benford demanded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... it&#039;s a standard spacecraft transponder, probably from one of those satellites, or more than one. Those things are built to last much longer than their mission lifetimes, just add power and you&#039;re good to go. I&#039;m checking the registry now...&quot;</p><p class="double">They waited a long moment as the tech and others entered commands and brought up information. The lead tech shook his head. &quot;Huh, it checks out alright, International Space Authority transponder code is valid, registration current... Transponder is registered to a Nightlight Industries, and they also registered a 1000 klick orbit, inclination... off-set... all the paperwork matches up. The spacecraft purpose even states orbital salvage and reclamation. It all checks out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t believe it!&quot; Vahlen exclaimed glaring up at the screen as if it had done her a personal injury. &quot;No-body noticed a purple unicorn wander into their office and fill out forms? Not to mention where did she... it get the money to set it up, or the knowledge?&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen replied. &quot;In reverse order: you, at least where to find the information; she still has most of that bag of gold; and a lot of the forms are electronic. No-body even sees them. It isn&#039;t like it&#039;s a sought after orbit, too high for earth sensing, too low for geostationary or GPS use. Even if someone did see it, there have been a couple of companies formed to develop ways to collect space garbage, and one even registered orbital slots. This would have looked like more of the same.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m more interested in what that other object is.&quot; Benford redirected their attention to the screen where Twilight was implanting the crystal in the body of the mass. Her head dipped to touch it with her horn, and it lit up from within with a purple glow, while patterns of golden light blaze don the sides. However nothing else seemed to happen. &quot;Hmmm... maybe it failed?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir!&quot; The lead tech caught his attention. &quot;I think you&#039;ll want to see this. We had the area under observation from the ground with optical telescopes in case the satellite failed, and... well, maybe it&#039;s better to show you.&quot;</p><p class="double">A second projected screen opened in front of them, and the mass of debris was once again seen from a distance. However, clearly circling it was a ring of glowing purple text. &#039;Crazy Twilight&#039;s Space Salvage&#039;. An inner ring proclaimed &#039;Out of this world prices!&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;A billboard.&quot; Doctor Vahlen exclaimed disgustedly. &quot;A giant holographic billboard!&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen was punching away at a calculator. &quot;Given those dimensions and if the brightness is... oh dear. It will be visible to the naked eye, obvious as a 2nd magnitude star. People are going to be looking, and even a hobbyist&#039;s telescope should be able to read the sign.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What does it think it&#039;s doing!&quot; Doctor Vahlen fumed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Advertising.&quot; Commander Benford replied. &quot;And making sure there&#039;s no way we can keep its presence quiet, I suspect.&quot;</p><p class="double">The control room was silent, in part because the occupants were still trying to come to terms with recent events, but mostly because no-one wanted to ask Commander Benford if he&#039;d just made a joke. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Magenta eyes slowly swivelled to meet lavender, wings furling as excitement drained away to sombre horror.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;....Clorophyl,&quot;</i> Twilight finally mumbled. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.2</p><p class="double">“Okay, Cookie,” Applebloom said, cracking her elbows. “I&#039;m out of other things to do. I&#039;m getting It out.”</p><p class="double"><i>What, precisely,</i> Cookie asked, <i>is It?</i></p><p class="double">“Oh, right, you weren&#039;t there for that. One of the really old loopers was clearing out his Pocket of loads of junk he didn&#039;t want – something about needing the storage space for another fleet – and there was this little golden egg thing going free, so I snapped it up. It looked interesting...” Applebloom mused.</p><p class="double">She sat back on the roof of the Appleloosa home she shared with her sister and brother – neither of them Awake. In fact, she and Twilight were the only Awake ponies on Equestria.</p><p class="double">It was a rather bizarre variant, from what Twilight had told her. Without Applejack to take up Honesty, Twilight had decided to try an experiment, and Gilda had ended up the Element of Brutal Honesty.</p><p class="double">She, Dash and Pinkie were engaged in a three way prank war which was claiming their combined dignities as the first casualties.</p><p class="double"><i>So, what is it?</i> Cookie pressed.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s just it.” Applebloom took a pair of tongs, and lifted the golden egg from her subspace pocket. “I&#039;ve got no idea, except that touching it is a really, really bad idea.

Differentiate e to th&#039; x.”</p><p class="double">“Answer&#039;s the same as the question – e to the x – unless you mean differentiating by a different variable, in which case zero. Come on, something a bit harder.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Mac thought for a while longer. “Well, if y&#039;all say that you really know your stuff... what&#039;s e raised to the power of the square root of negative one times a linear variable?”</p><p class="double">“A cosine curve in radians.”</p><p class="double">Mac looked at her. Then he nodded. “Eeyup, that&#039;s right. And y&#039; say that you know all th&#039; subjects?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded.</p><p class="double">“Well, ah&#039;ll keep an eye on th&#039; scores y&#039;all get on th&#039; exams, but fer now you got yourself a deal.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is amazing!” Applebloom said, furiously tapping away at the controls which were moving the electron probe over the surface of the egg. “It&#039;s <i>all</i> machinery. Solid machinery, on an atomic scale.”</p><p class="double">She paused over a number of pits in the surface of the egg, one after the other. “This is some kind of sensor – visual. And this uses scent. And this can only be a physical contact sensor! This thing can detect more with a square millimetre of surface than most animals can with their whole bodies!”</p><p class="double">Carefully, she lowered the microprobe over a different kind of pit, and used the tunneling mode to peel back a tiny section of surface.</p><p class="double">“This is just so cool!”</p><p class="double"><i>What&#039;s that you&#039;re looking at?</i> Cookie asked, paying attention to the screen herself. </p><p class="double">“It looks like a kind of... nanotech stinging cell.” Applebloom sobered a bit. “Okay, <i>definitely</i> not touching this thing. But I can probably use some of the tech that goes into this...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay.” Applebloom checked the range safety; good. Then the eraser warhead, which was ready to go.</p><p class="double">Nanotech was scary stuff. But, with a few... perhaps slightly Trixie-flavoured precautions, a lot of the threat could be accounted for.</p><p class="double">Which was why Applebloom was telefactoring a drone from ten miles away.</p><p class="double">“Initiating mycelium.”</p><p class="double">The drone (which, for reasons of Applebloom&#039;s own, looked an awful lot like a motorized pine tree) dripped the contents of a small vial onto the surface of a chunk of volcanic rock.</p><p class="double">There was a froth of bubbles, which quickly died away, and then a mass of hair-fine filaments spread over the surface of the rock.</p><p class="double">Five minutes later, the rock crumpled in on itself. What was left was a set of twenty nodules of varying sizes, each a pure metal ore.</p><p class="double">Applebloom checked a couple of readouts, then exhaled. “Right. And it cleaned up after itself, too – good.”</p><p class="double">Given the tech in question, that hadn&#039;t been a certainty...</p><p class="double"><i>What now?</i></p><p class="double">“Well, ah think there&#039;s about three more months o&#039; work before that node is completely dismantled,” Applebloom guessed. “Good thing ah&#039;ve been takin&#039; it slow, too, &#039;cause of all the traps an&#039; all.”</p><p class="double"><i>True,</i> Cookie allowed.</p><p class="double">There&#039;d been at least one close call with a nasty computer virus – one seemingly implicit in the very design of a sub-component of the object, and almost sapient in the sheer sophistication that went into it.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, Applebloom had managed to catch it in time, and Cookie had fought it off within the computer system itself.</p><p class="double">“This thing&#039;s almost an entire nanotech ecology, is what it is...” Applebloom mused, then shrugged. “Well, ah guess we&#039;re harvestin&#039; the crops and tryin&#039; to kill the pests.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And...” Applebloom saved the final file on her handheld. “Done!”</p><p class="double">She grinned with the euphoria of finally having finished her self-appointed task, which banished the slightly muzzy feeling of two consecutive coffee-fuelled all nighters. The egg – which was, according to internal code snippets, something called a Jain node – had been completely dismantled, all the inbuilt traps avoided by a slow and steady approach involving a great deal of caution.</p><p class="double">Sure, about ninety percent of what she&#039;d learned was far too dangerous to use, but the remaining ten percent would let her finally crack the inherent problems involved with most nanotechnology.</p><p class="double">Well... if she had Cookie to run it, anyway. A dismayingly large portion of the software needed to run this Jain technology was written in a form that was as virulent as the rest of it.</p><p class="double"><i>Um...</i> Cookie cut in on her thoughts.</p><p class="double">“What?” Before she forgot, Applebloom slipped the handheld into her subspace pocket. She wasn&#039;t about to lose fully five years of effort when the Tree of Doom rolled around next week.</p><p class="double"><i>You appear to have... wings. And a horn.</i></p><p class="double">The filly went stock still.</p><p class="double">“Can you repeat that, please?”</p><p class="double"><i>You seem to have Ascended.</i></p><p class="double">“Oh.” Applebloom tried to get her head around that. “Huh, ah always thought we&#039;d do it together. Scoots, Belle and me.”</p><p class="double">Cookie didn&#039;t say anything.</p><p class="double">“Right. In about ten seconds, ah&#039;m gonna actually realize what just happened. So if you&#039;ll excuse me, ah&#039;ll freakout for a bit.”</p><p class="double"><i>Sure.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom took one more breath, then started running around in circles.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Just...” Applebloom shook her head, watching the sun go down over a mesa in the far distance. “Ah&#039;m still overwhelmed by this.”</p><p class="double"><i>I understand</i>, Cookie said. <i>I suppose it must be very confusing. I mean, I felt strange enough becoming a pendant, but I was at least ready for it.</i></p><p class="double">“Yeah, ah know what y&#039; mean,” Applebloom agreed. “Still, ah don&#039;t think th&#039; loops have ever blindsided me like <i>this</i>.”</p><p class="double"><i>Technically, this was all you. Not the Loops at all.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom directed a glower at Cookie&#039;s pendant.</p><p class="double"><i>Sorry, that was flippant,</i> Cookie said, with a tone of contrition.</p><p class="double">“I... no, ah understand,” Applebloom admitted. “Just... don&#039;t tell th&#039; other Crusaders, okay? Or your friends. Ah...”</p><p class="double">She kicked the ground.</p><p class="double">“Ah feel <i>embarassed</i>, is what it is, &#039;cause ah feel like ah&#039;ve left them behind. Like... well, we always wanted t&#039; find cutie marks, and... by the time we started loopin&#039;, we were told by Twilight that we&#039;d all got several different ones in different loops we weren&#039;t Awake for. But...” The filly scuffed at the dirt again, before slumping to the floor and rolling on her back, heedless of her new wings, to watch the stars come out. “Ah never gave a moment&#039;s thought to how we&#039;d all feel if just <i>one</i> of us got a cutie mark. Back before we got t&#039; Looping.”</p><p class="double"><i>I think I see. You feel like you&#039;ve lost one of the things which you shared with your friends.</i></p><p class="double">“Yeah.”</p><p class="double">For several minutes, neither of them made a sound.</p><p class="double"><i>You will have to tell Twilight eventually,</i> Cookie pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Probably, yeah,” Applebloom said quietly. “It&#039;d be best to get it done this loop, when there ain&#039;t any other loopers and she can help me get all this worked out. But... ah don&#039;t want to. At all.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow, I&#039;ve got some bad news.&quot; Twilight sighed, holding out a newsletter. &quot;Yearling&#039;s pushed back the release by two months.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;TWO MONTHS?&quot; The pegasus snatched the newsletter and opened it quickly. &quot;That&#039;s... that&#039;s eight more loops I have to wait!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eight more expansion periods,&quot; Twilight corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uuuuurgh, I wish she was looping so she could finish sooner.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s got a life of her own, Dash. We can&#039;t really force her to do anything.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;All we can do is wait.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... I guess you&#039;re right.&quot; With a sigh, Rainbow Dash tossed the newsletter into the garbage. &quot;It&#039;s not like anything important will happen because of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember the old days where we&#039;d go on crazy adventures just because, I dunno, you wanted a book from the hospital or I was late for a friendship letter?&quot; The alicorn giggled and rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. We really got caught up by unimportant things. Well, loop&#039;s ending tomorrow.... wanna help me with a really stupid stunt?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Alright, but if I die then next loop you have to dress in style and give fashion tips.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I guess that&#039;s fair.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.3 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie <i>loved</i> this Loop. It had, in her opinion, everything. Epic battles for the fate of the universe; ninja; robots; aliens; mutant races nature probably never intended; an amazing back story of love, loss, and betrayal; the coolest non-deity identity she&#039;d looped into yet; and the bestest new friends ever!</p><p class="double">&quot;So he was an ancient ninja master who turned traitor over some woman his rival loved and left the country to start a megacorp to take over the world, but really all along he was some squishy brain alien criminal in a robot suit who had designs on taking over the whole galaxy once he manufactured an army of ninja robots and super mutants her of Earth and the only force that could stop him was a secret band of mutant ninjas, you all, living in the sewers! Oh, and the lovely science assistant and intrepid reporter, me, of course. And we beat him!&quot; Pinkie was practically vibrating with excitement. &quot;You know what this calls for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A pizza party!&quot; her companion in the orange mask yelled with equal enthusiasm.</p><p class="double">&quot;Two of them,&quot; the one in the red mask griped for the umpteenth time this Loop. &quot;Why in the wide, wide multiverse did there have to be two of them?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Statistics,&quot; the one with the purple mask replied with good humor. &quot;We were bound to run into someone like her in these Loops sooner or later.&quot;</p><p class="double">The leader in the blue mask just gave a long-suffering sigh. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Rainbow Dash landed in the middle of a desert, eyeing the strange fortress warily.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay.... how the hay did we not notice this before?&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn shrugged, reapplying the cooling charms on both of them. &quot;A week ago this was a heavily forested region. Granted, I&#039;ve been here a few times before, but....&quot; She chuckled awkwardly. &quot;Well, usually I was just out camping or doing one of my crazier schemes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Crazier.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did I ever tell you about the time I convinced Celestia and Luna that Equestria ran on Newtonian physics? I had to set up a secret lab to automate the weather and wrest control of the sun and moon from them... the looks on their faces, I&#039;m telling you, hilarious.&quot; She gestured around the blackened sands. &quot;Anyway, this is where I had my secret animal training facility. To... dedomesticate them... actually, yeah, this fortress was here then too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow sighed, ascending for a moment. &quot;Twilight, this fortress is practically throbbing with weather magic. The mystery of the heat wave? Right here. Frankly we&#039;re lucky to have found it before it melted itself down.&quot; She tapped the stone briefly before snapping back with a yelp. &quot;OH SWEET MAPLE LEAVES! Ow, ow ow.... huh, it doesn&#039;t hurt anymore...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Here, let me see that.&quot; The purple pony brought her face close to the blackened hoof, wincing in sympathy. &quot;Ow. Wow, okay, that&#039;s a <i>fourth</i> degree burn. I&#039;m going to have to use a localized time spell to reverse this, there&#039;s no way it&#039;ll just heal....&quot;</p><p class="double">The blue pony held her hoof out patiently while her friend tended to her. &quot;Fourth degree? It&#039;s difficult to burn a pegasus, what with our magic and all, and you&#039;re telling me that this fortress somehow managed to charcoalize an alicorn&#039;s hoof?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmyep.&quot; Twilight took a breath, shaking her head. &quot;Okay, before we go any further I&#039;m going to need to put more defensive wards on us.&quot; Her horn glowed even brighter, spells weaving through the air for a full minute and enveloping the pair in brightly shining runes. When she finally finished, she took out two pairs of goggles and handed one to Dash.</p><p class="double">The former pegasus put them on without question. &quot;I take it that this is serious?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m operating under the assumption that somebody tried to make a star in here. So yeah, super serious.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even with the shields on, the two could feel the blast of heat on their faces as they entered the fortress. Twilight cast a few spells and sagged in relief. &quot;Ha, I was wrong. No stars, just... apparently a reverse heat ray aimed at the sun. It&#039;s overloaded, but at least the safeties held.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash stared at her. &quot;What, exactly, would happen if the safeties didn&#039;t hold?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All the heat would have been released at once and the atmosphere would be set on fire.&quot; Twilight trotted up to a pillar of melted bronze and gold, kicking away an odd skeleton and flicking a spell or two around the metal. &quot;If I can just aim an exhaust spell at the sun, I might be able to send all the conserved heat back. I think this was meant to be a storm generator, you know, warm up the local air currents to cause a rainstorm or something.... who the heck pointed it directly at the sun?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahuizotl.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn rolled her eyes. &quot;Rainbow, I&#039;m pretty sure that the Daring Do series is labelled fiction this loop-&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash pointed at the big skeleton that Twilight had kicked away. &quot;No, that&#039;s Ahuizotl. I know from one of my Daring Do loops. That is, one hundred percent, the real deal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Twilight peered at the corpse. &quot;Well... okay, that&#039;s weird. I was sure we were in a baseline loop, and the Daring Do is labelled as fictional...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think she&#039;s around?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If she is...&quot; With a sigh, the Anchor turned to face her friend. &quot;She&#039;s dead. At least for this loop... should be ending soon anyway. This doesn&#039;t make sense! I&#039;m going to have to stake this area out next loop....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack broke out laughing, barely able to hold onto the mug that her brother had prepared for her. &quot;So Maccy ended up being yer sister fer the loop, eh? Ah gotta admit that cracks me up ta think about.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes, sipping her punch with a smirk. &quot;Biggest princess you ever saw, hooves as thick as his neck.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmer leaned over the table. &quot;So what did ya have ta banish Mac fer when it came time?&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian grinned slyly. &quot;I didn&#039;t, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait... what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, okay, get this.&quot; Putting her glass down, Twilight spread her hooves out. &quot;We&#039;ve just imprisoned Discord, and all the ponies are worshipping us as gods. Typical, so far. Mac decides he&#039;ll be in charge of the judiciary branch of the government, I&#039;ll get executive, and the lawmakers will be mortal. So of course right off the bat the Wardens are formed to be my church and the Sages go off to follow him. With me so far?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, so about seven years in a law is passed that only Wardens and Sages can see us, cause the mortal ponies still view us as gods. I&#039;m not happy with it, and Mac doesn&#039;t seem happy with it, but it does prevent some of the more constant genuflecting.&quot; The unicorn shook her head. &quot;But Macintosh has some of his Sages start a few rumours. A sentence here, an argument there.... I don&#039;t know, I was too busy carrying out my duties to even notice. In about two hundred and thirty years, nopony believes we exist.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack stared at her friend. &quot;Ah.... wait, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight burst out laughing. &quot;He, hahah, he managed to get us relegated to pagan gods! Yeah, the Wardens and the Sages still existed but aside from a core council, most ponies believed that the Blind Warden and the Silent Sage were just holdovers from less &#039;enlightened&#039; times! I didn&#039;t even know until five hundred years after Discord when I finally decided to take a walk outside and got compliments on, on my costume!&quot; She snorted. &quot;Of course I was a tad miffed at first but the more I thought about it... If I didn&#039;t need to banish Mac then I wouldn&#039;t lose the connection to the elements, and Discord&#039;s prison wouldn&#039;t weaken, and, well, things were actually a lot calmer. Mac and I took to travelling Equestria to help out where we could--we did check back into Canterlot every decade to remind the Councils we existed, but other then that nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmer stared at her friend. &quot;Seriously. That... he did that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I know! Craziest thing.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was pretty common knowledge throughout the multiverse that loopers were, practically speaking, near demigods. True, they didn&#039;t always use their power and a number of them actively restrained themselves from appearing out of the ordinary to the non-looping populace. But when a pony has subjectively lived a few hundred millennia, using their time to study magic and gather technological trinkets, it wasn&#039;t at all difficult to set up a network of invisible spies around an ancient fortress, sabotage a stack of magical rings without leaving a trace, and watch the whole thing from the comforts of a home in a tree shaped library.</p><p class="double">Twilight sipped her tea as the events on the magical screen played out again. Ahuizotl had his rant, left Daring in a death trap, and went to complete his evil plot. Daring struggled free, but not in time to stop Ahuizotl from placing the final ring.... which didn&#039;t do anything, thanks to Twilight&#039;s own sabotage. Then the creature would carefully examine everything about the ancient doomsday device, Daring would burst in, dramatic fight scene.... Daring flew away.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is the fifth loop this has happened,&quot; Twilight muttered, taking notes. She tapped her hoof thoughtfully, remembering her search of high end museums and being surprised to find &quot;replicas&quot; of artefacts from the series. The Sapphire Stone statue, the Griffon&#039;s Goblet – everything that the books said Daring had sent to a collection was actually <i>in</i> a collection, somewhere, though often a very secure and private one. Even stranger, though, were the people she encountered in her investigations; right out of the books themselves, Daring&#039;s extended family, various enemies and allies... Nothing for it but to say the books were true.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d have to ask Celestia about her cameo in some of them...</p><p class="double">&quot;Why would A.K. Yearling say this was fictional?&quot; Twilight pondered. &quot;I mean... who is A.K. Yearling anyway?&quot; That had been the single gap in her investigations. The author of the series was only known through her publishing company. Yes, there had been the biography snipped in the back, but they were generic and, upon investigation, had no supporting paper trail. That led to the inevitable conclusion that A.K. Yearling was a fictional persona... but whose? </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.5</p><p class="double">Keeping secrets from friends sucked.</p><p class="double">That, Applebloom was sure, was the truth in any universe.</p><p class="double">“So,” Sweetie said, grinning. “&#039;nother loop without us, huh? Do anything good?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom answered the grin, as well as she could. “Main thing was actually hundreds of miles away – ask Twilight about that. All I know is that, because we&#039;d moved to Appleloosa before the loop itself started, the Element of Honesty got a new bearer.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Scoots nodded. “Tell us more!”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not going to believe this...” Applebloom paused for effect. “Gilda.”</p><p class="double">“No!” Diamond Tiara covered her mouth with a hoof to hide her giggles.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Applebloom replied, shaking her head. “From what Twilight put in her letters to me, she and Dash and Pinkie were involved in basically a permanent prank war from the moment the Nightmare Night thing died down to the moment the Loop ended.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, what was her element like?” Scootaloo asked, curious. “You know, the whole user friendly thing. Twilight and Trixie tend to get crowns, the other girls get necklaces, Spike&#039;s one is a gorget with a flame on it... Gilda doesn&#039;t have a cutie mark, so?”</p><p class="double">“Necklace, I think.” Applebloom shrugged. “We only went back to Ponyville once for a meeting with Filthy Rich, so I didn&#039;t have much chance t&#039; look around. Could ask Twilight.”</p><p class="double">She sniggered. “Filthy looked a bit run ragged, actually. And there was a crater in the main square which I think was Pinkie&#039;s fault.”</p><p class="double">Diamond gave Applebloom a glower. It didn&#039;t work. “That <i>is</i> my father of whom you are speaking...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, so?” Applebloom winked. “We all laughed at Princess Maccie, didn&#039;t we?”</p><p class="double">She stopped, suddenly feeling uncomfortable.</p><p class="double">“Anything else happen?” Sweetie asked, after a moment.</p><p class="double">“Nothing really important.”</p><p class="double">After so long living with the Element-bearer of Honesty, the lie slid out as smooth as silk.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I did do a bit of research into nanotech, though,” she supplied, trying to get onto slightly safer ground without lying any more. “Should help in building my workshop without needing to keep half my pocket full of the heavy machinery.”</p><p class="double">“Neat.” Scootaloo nodded. “It&#039;d be good if we could get some aircraft carriers built next time we play battleships, actually.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m pretty sure that this stuff would let us build fleets if Cookie can run it right,” Applebloom mused.</p><p class="double">“So!” Sweetie clapped her hooves. “Did you get a cutie mark for it?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Applebloom said, clamping down on her nervousness. “Nothing special.”</p><p class="double">Another lie.</p><p class="double">The mark in question had been a golden spanner, with what looked like the same patterns-made-of-patterns that the Jain egg had had.</p><p class="double">It hadn&#039;t stuck around past the Loop refresh, though, which sunk that idea – but Cookie had just that morning confirmed that the ascension had, indeed, left a permanent mark on her magic.</p><p class="double">A little twist of non-native pony type magic – some pegasus, some unicorn – ready to expand out on command, and with the proper catalyst. A catalyst like Smart Cookie.</p><p class="double">Testing <i>that</i> would be a very, very bad idea. After all, she didn&#039;t know how to reverse it...</p><p class="double">“Okay, so, what&#039;s next for this loop?” Diamond Tiara asked officiously.</p><p class="double">“Ah vote we sleep through class an&#039; get perfect marks,” Applebloom suggested.</p><p class="double">“Good start,” Scootaloo allowed. “But needs something more. Diamond, any ideas?”</p><p class="double">“Is Chrysalis awake?” Tiara pondered. “If so, we could set up a kind of &#039;kid superheroes&#039; thing... you know, barely-there cover identities, interchangeable minions and one monster once a week...”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll supply the ridiculously conspicuous base,” Applebloom volunteered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you mean you can&#039;t take me to her?&quot; Twilight Sparkle boggled.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie smiled. &quot;Exactly what I said. I Pinkie Promised not to reveal her location or identity to anyone.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash growled in aggravation. &quot;And how many loops ago was this?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Doesn&#039;t matter! A promise is a promise is a promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, something IMPORTANT is happening here. And A.K. Yearling is at the centre of it. Can you... give me a hint, maybe?&quot; The alicorn smiled wearily. &quot;Please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Tell you what. Her birthday is in two weeks. If you can completely disconnect any sense of direction you have, no magic compass or anything, you can be the mare in the cake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll do it!&quot; Rainbow interjected.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</i> Twilight snapped around. &quot;SERIOUSLY?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, what&#039;s a little embarrassment compared to awesomeness?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, it&#039;s settled then!&quot; Pinkie quipped brightly. &quot;Oh this is going to be so much fun!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.6 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Harry King was a successful scrap metal merchant, in part because he was willing to take risks. For example, he&#039;d invested in recycling and benefited from ever increasingly strict laws. His yard could even strip down aircraft and handle the more exotic metals such as tungsten and titanium. As a result, he got a lot of specialist trade, and those same metals were worth a lot more than most.</p><p class="double">He was in his office, a double storey affair made out of 40 foot containers but upgraded considerably, overlooking the main yard. He was finalising one such deal, with an outfit that called itself Nightlight Industries. From his checks, a brand new company specialising in &#039;new developments in transportation and industrial processes&#039; according to their website. Looked like one of their first deals had involved acquiring some wrecked aerospace gear and now they wanted to sell what they couldn&#039;t salvage. There was always good stuff in those.</p><p class="double">The terms of the contract they suggested were agreeable, even generous, and they&#039;d even agreed to pick up the delivery costs and import duties. While there was always the possibility of some kind of scam when you got a juicy contract like this, the payment, a percentage of the profits was due only after he&#039;d processed and sold the materials. They were also liable for any disagreement over title. In short, he was golden, and he&#039;d sent through the signed contract only a couple of hours ago.</p><p class="double">Now he was on the phone with their deliveries staff, a girl by the name of Twilight. Crazy names some people hung on their kids these days, and not the sort of name you heard in connection with heavy transport vehicles. At least that&#039;s what he&#039;d assumed when he heard the interference on her mobile phone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, so where in your yard do you want me to deliver? The first load of 100 tons is ready,&quot; she said.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve cleared out bay 3 for your trucks, someone at the gate can direct you when you get here. You have the address in your GPS?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Got it up on Google maps, and I can see it clearly. Bay 3 is that one two down from the entrance?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, you people certainly seem pretty on the ball.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve found it doesn&#039;t pay to let the grass grow under your hooves. Okay, it&#039;s clear of obstructions...&quot;</p><p class="double">That made him do a mental double-take. &#039;Hooves?!&#039;</p><p class="double">There was a bright flash and a fading purple glow around a big pile of scrap metal with an undeniable high-tech look to it that had appeared in bay three. Exactly what it had been was unclear as it was made up of finely divided pieces. Hovering over it was a floating figure, a purple pony of some kind wearing an orange coverall and white hard hat. She glided down on outstretched wings and walked towards the site offices. He absently noted that the hard-hat had a hole for a spiral horn. Wait, hadn&#039;t he heard his daughter going on about something like that in Japan?</p><p class="double">The UK had suffered minimal raids by the invaders, but that didn&#039;t stop several of his workers from freaking out and running as fast as they could in the opposite direction. The rest just stood there in stunned surprise. The phone he&#039;d dropped in his distraction spoke, and he snatched it up, fumbling it before he finally got it to his ear.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, you can check it yourself, but there&#039;s a minimum of 100 tons of stuff there. Not sure how much natural debris got mixed in, but it&#039;s mostly nickel iron anyway, so it should be all good.&quot; It was the same voice, and as the purple alien approached, he could see a mobile phone held up against her head with no visible means of support, and her mouth moving.</p><p class="double">He responded in the most eloquent and concise manner he was currently capable of. &quot;Gaaah!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry? Look, I know I&#039;m not what you were expecting, but you signed a contract, I delivered on it, now I&#039;m coming up there to get your signature on the delivery receipt.&quot; The voice gave a long-suffering sigh. </p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, alien purple alicorn. I get that a lot. But I&#039;m not one of those invaders, I&#039;m just here to fulfil a business contract. If I was all &#039;Grr&#039; and &#039;Argh&#039; and &#039;kill, maim, destroy&#039; then you&#039;d have some comeback, but since I&#039;m not, can we both at least <i>try</i> to behave like reasonable adults?&quot; </p><p class="double">He could hear her climbing up the exterior stairs to the office level as she spoke, but it was the unvarying calmness of the voice as much as anything that kept him from panicking. The outside door clanged and there was a squeak from outside and the voice said, &quot;And your secretary fainted, just perfect! It seems legal secretaries are made of sterner stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was an echo to the voice which indicated the speaker was just outside. &quot;May I come in?&quot;</p><p class="double">He put down the phone. &quot;Could I stop you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, if you say &#039;no&#039;. But that would make it hard to get your signature on the delivery note. I could always just blind teleport it through the door to you, or just leave it out here and go off for a coffee if you feel uncomfortable. Celestia knows I could do with a cup. Having people run away in terror when you say &#039;hello&#039; can get kind of depressing.&quot;</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t sound like some ravening monster out to suck his brain out through his eyeballs, so he decided to once again take a risk. &quot;Okay, come on in.&quot;</p><p class="double">The door opened and the purple unicorn trotted in. Under other circumstances the big eyed creature in overalls would have been adorable. Her horn glowed, and an electronic tablet levitated out of a pair of saddlebags. It floated over to him, and she said, &quot;Sign in the highlighted boxes please.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dumbly, he took the stylus and signed under the eyes of the alien, who was watching with an expression of alert interest. &quot;I know this is a lot to take in, but hopefully you&#039;ll come to see that I&#039;m just a differently shaped person. One who you can do business with.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought I was doing business with Nightlight Industries.&quot; Harry was finally coming out of his state of shock, and wondering about what other surprises he&#039;d end up having to deal with.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are.” She tapped the coverall which he could now see had a logo similar to the contract he&#039;d signed. “Legally I&#039;m not a person, so I had to organise a company, a legal entity to act on my behalf. Well first I got a solicitor, a good one, and he fixed things up for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">That begged the question of why, but there was a more immediate concern. &quot;And is this even legal? Where did you get that stuff?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As of the Berne Decision of 2015, perfectly legal. As you saw I have powers, magic technically, and it allowed me to sweep all of low Earth Orbit clear of the junk that&#039;s accumulated, selectively to avoid active satellites and the inactive ones the Berne rules don&#039;t cover, but those are all intact and there aren&#039;t too many of them, so they&#039;re not a problem. I have all the rest balled up in an orbit 600 miles up, about 5000 tons in total; so if you&#039;re satisfied with this load, I&#039;ve got a lot more business I can do with you. I guess they haven&#039;t released the news yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">That had him reaching for the cabinet he kept his hospitality drinks in, then he decided he needed all his wits about him, and opened the side of the cabinet which had an instant percolator in. Almost automatically he offered, &quot;Coffee?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, thank you!&quot; There was genuine pleasure in her voice. &quot;Cream and two sugars please!&quot;</p><p class="double">He set the percolator going and turned back to face her, sitting down behind his desk. &quot;What&#039;s the Berne Decision?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d have thought you&#039;d know, it&#039;s more your field than mine. It used to be that even after a satellite had died and was just junk, it was still owned by the launching country or company. There was no right of salvage like there was at sea. But then you guys had a bunch of collisions, lots of damage and billion dollar payouts, and those owners decided they didn&#039;t want liability any more. Add to that the aliens blowing up even more of them, and you have all the ingredients for a major about face.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Berne Decision was signed just last year and was explained as an initiative to promote private space industry, and basically made satellites more than 2 years past their end of operational life legal salvage, along with parts of destroyed satellites. There was a big fuss from the Americans about somebody stealing technology, until some senator made a comment about paying out billions to protect technology less advanced than the game console he&#039;d gotten his niece.&quot;</p><p class="double">She grinned. &quot;Lucky break for me, or what I did _would_ have been illegal, and while I can&#039;t commit crimes, being an un-person, Nightlight Industries would have been liable. Everything in that pile is within the laws. So don&#039;t worry, all the legal stuff is taken care of. I even arranged for a customs official to come over from the local airport to certify it. Of course, she doesn&#039;t know the full story, but this is the de facto point of entry, and you, or rather I acted with all possible speed to comply with the regulations on metal importation, so you&#039;re covered.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled some papers from her saddlebag, and placed them on his desk. &quot;Certification, permits, it&#039;s all there and all filled out. I&#039;ve even included a paper with the relevant sections of the Berne Agreement and guidelines in case she hasn&#039;t boned up on them. I intend to do this again, and I want to make sure you want to do business with Nightlight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But why?&quot; The buzz of the percolator showed it had a full jug, and he mechanically got up and made coffee.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why am I doing all this? Because I want to help, and your world needs it. But having some mysterious space unicorn come in and solve problems with a wave of her horn would be only slightly less terrifying than the invaders. Better I use my powers indirectly and work my philanthropy through human agencies. But that requires money.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why am I doing it the way I am, showily rather than behind the scenes which would fit better with my indirect action strategy? Partly because it amuses me, and hopefully because it will amuse the humans who hear about it, at least if they have any sense of the absurd. A friend of mine once showed me that it&#039;s harder to be scared of something if you&#039;re laughing at it, or with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her telekinesis took the cup of coffee off the desk where he&#039;d put it, and she sipped. &quot;Ah! This planet has _good_ coffee! I intend to keep pranking the entire planet while at the same time helping out. Hopefully people will see not all aliens are like the invaders. Some of us have a sense of humour, and a sense of honour. Oh dear...&quot;</p><p class="double">There were flashing red and blue lights arriving at the entrance. &quot;Looks like one of your employees recovered enough to call in the riot squad. It&#039;s okay, I&#039;ve got this.&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to go, and Harry found himself saying, &quot;Wait! You&#039;re just going to walk right up to them? They probably have armed officers with them, wouldn&#039;t it be safer to just do that teleport thing and leave?&quot;</p><p class="double">That got him a brilliant smile, back over her shoulder. &quot;Thanks for thinking about me, but it&#039;s okay, I&#039;m not doing anything illegal. Like I said, I&#039;ve got this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Three police cars and a van pulled into the yard and started spilling out police officers, though none of them had guns. The police cars formed a barricade for the police, and one of them raised a loud hailer. &quot;Can anyone in the building hear me! Try to signal if you can. we have reinforcements on the way!&quot;</p><p class="double">Harry opened his window. &quot;I&#039;m fine, everyone in here is fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">The officer with the speaker, an otherwise relatively blameless individual by the name of Inspector Burns, called out. &quot;Sir, one of your employees sent us a video of an alien entering your offices. Has it hurt anyone?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, my secretary fainted, but I think that was just surprise. I believe she&#039;s about to come out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your secretary?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The alien.&quot; As if that was a cue, the exterior door opened and Twilight stepped out into the metal stairs, still wearing her overalls and hard hat, but also wearing over her wings a pair of giant foam rubber hands with a Nightlight Industries logo and &#039;#1&#039; on them. She pouted. &quot;And here I was ready to come out with my hands up. I&#039;ve watched your visual media, isn&#039;t that what police are supposed to say?&quot;</p><p class="double">The officer goggled at the sight, and the fact that the ravening alien monster their caller had told them about seemed to treat this as a joke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Stay right where you, lay down where you are and put...&quot; Burns stopped himself just in time, though in fairness he was going to say &#039;your hands behind your head.&#039;</p><p class="double">Surprisingly enough the creature complied and even spread her foam covered wings flat to the metal grid floor, though even across the yard they could see her roll her eyes. &quot;Um... am I being arrested? Because that&#039;s not legal. I&#039;m not a person, I&#039;m a working animal, I even have papers to prove it. The most you could do is call an animal control officer. Or the RSPCA.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We have! And the army, so don&#039;t get any funny ideas!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The RSPCA? But I wasn&#039;t mistreated, I even got coffee... I thought the foam hands were pretty funny, but okay. I&#039;m perfectly willing to comply with any reasonable requests by a duly authorised representative of the law.&quot; </p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and the wings vanished. All the police flinched. &quot;Oh, for Celestia&#039;s sake! I don&#039;t <i>have</i> hands, so I have to do everything with magic. Look, we can sort this all out if you just let me present my papers. If you don&#039;t want me to levitate them over to you, you can just come and collect them. I won&#039;t move, won&#039;t light up my horn or anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">Inspector Burns had to think. Risk the creature using it&#039;s powers for something else, or approach it. They weren&#039;t supposed to engage it, just establish a cordon and perform rescue duties if possible. None of his hasty orders had envisioned it co-operating. &quot;Send them over.&quot;</p><p class="double">Under other circumstances watching the folder full of paper floating across enveloped in a purple aura would have been fascinating. As it was, he watched the unicorn like a hawk until the folder landed on the bonnet of his car. He picked up the perfectly regular manilla folder and leafed through them. He wasn&#039;t an expert on such things, but it all looked properly legal. It basically said that Twilight Sparkle was a working animal for Nightlight Industries, like one of their own police horses. He had spent a year working in the mounted division so he had at least some idea what he was looking at. There was a veterinary certificate and everything seemed to be in order.</p><p class="double">“How the heck did you get a vet to sign off on you?”</p><p class="double">“One seriously surprised vet. He wasn&#039;t used to having a patient who could talk back. Used a couple of diagnostic spells on other animals to show how they worked, then cast them on myself. My, am I glad I helped my friend Fluttershy out at her animal shelter.”</p><p class="double">Inspector Burns started to ask for more information, then decided the answers would probably just complicate things even more.</p><p class="double">&quot;But if you&#039;re a working animal, shouldn&#039;t you have a handler?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m my own handler, I got a BTEC in Animal Management from the University Collage of Kent. It&#039;s all in there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, how? How could you enroll, how could you go to classes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Distance learning, I did it all over the internet, and I paid my course fees myself. On my home world I&#039;m a librarian, astronomer and magical researcher with the equivalent of multiple postgraduate degrees, and spells I developed specifically to help me learn faster, and <i>that</i> was when I was a plain old unicorn. I audited the course in three hours, and took the final exam right afterwards. Doesn&#039;t matter, it&#039;s an accredited school, and they didn&#039;t require me to demonstrate my person-hood, only my competence. Which since I got a top grade with distinction, I did.&quot;</p><p class="double">Burns noticed something else. &quot;It also says you&#039;re owned by Nightlight Industries... well you&#039;d have to be, but isn&#039;t that slavery? Even if you&#039;re not a legal person, you&#039;re clearly intelligent. That would make the company acting illegally.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s covered. It&#039;s a private share limited company, I own all the shares as I put in the initial investment and capital equipment, such as myself, there&#039;s plenty of precedent for an animal owning shares, even a controlling interest, but being legally incompetent, they have to have a human with power of attorney to manage them, my lawyer in my case. That means I own the company&#039;s assets, including myself. So I own myself, and that&#039;s not slavery, in fact it&#039;s the very opposite. I know it&#039;s convoluted and daft, but I don&#039;t fit in any of the regular categories, so loopholes are all I&#039;ve got.&quot;</p><p class="double">She shifted a bit. &quot;So, what exactly am I doing wrong that requires so many highly trained police officers to stop me? I delivered a load of scrap metals from the salvage I collected in orbit on behalf of Nightlight Industries, as required by our contract. At no time did I make a threatening action towards anyone on this site. The only crime here is wasting police time, and I wasn&#039;t the one who was responsible for that. Could I get up? My wings are starting to cramp.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were creating a disturbance.&quot; Inspector Burns was feeling as if he and the entire group of police had been made fools of.</p><p class="double">&quot;By existing? Surely that only applies if I was acting in a disorderly manner, and if I was a human. As an animal, animal control officers would be responsible for my capture, but that requires me to be acting in a dangerous manner. If this place has security cameras, it will prove I did nothing of the sort. So, please can I get up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Burns glowered for a moment, then nodded. &quot;Very well, but make no sudden moves.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight got up and flexed her wings, then stretched them out. “I&#039;m going to come down the stairs now...” </p><p class="double">She glided gently down the stairway before landing and walking slowly out into the open. &quot;Look, I know this must feel pretty silly, but you&#039;re not the ones who are responsible...&quot;</p><p class="double">A news van rolled up at the gate. &quot;... I&#039;ve seen the sort of things you expected to face in Japan, and you guys don&#039;t even have guns. That&#039;s not stupid, that&#039;s courageous! Could I have my papers back...? On second thoughts I&#039;ll make a copy, with your permission?&quot;</p><p class="double">Burns nodded, and her horn flashed. Suddenly there were two copies of the paperwork in front of him, and one set levitated back towards Twilight, captured by the camera crew that was just moving up behind the police cordon.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s only a manifested copy, not real matter, so it will disappear in about three hours. I&#039;d probably get it photocopied before then. Now, can I go? We&#039;ve established that you don&#039;t actually have grounds to hold me. I have other loads to deliver, other contracts to fill.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;How in the name of Tartarus did you find me?&quot; the pegasus grumbled, glowering at the plate in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;d have to ask Pinkie,&quot; shrugged the other pegasus, tugging at a plastic hairclip. &quot;I&#039;m just the dancing girl.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I&#039;m straight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash snorted. &quot;And I don&#039;t swing at all. Honestly I think Pinkie wanted me along so you would feel &#039;justified&#039; in writing the Do series. &#039;I&#039;m your biggest fan, I&#039;d do anything for you...&#039;&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I know how that can get, so if you don&#039;t want that I&#039;m cool.&quot;</p><p class="double">The other pegasus peered over her glasses. &quot;Really. Do you have a fanclub?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmyep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What books have you written?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash chuckled. &quot;I&#039;m more an athlete then a writer, buuuuuut....&quot; She reached a hoof under the table, flicking through her subspace pocket and pulling out a duplicate of her own novel. &quot;Ever hear of Iris Drake?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her companion accepted the book, flicking an eyebrow up as she examined it. &quot;These are incredibly rare. And you&#039;re claiming to have written them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Even have the original manuscript, if you want to see it.&quot; Dash grinned. &quot;I did take some influence from your series, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm. I didn&#039;t see any saddlebags on you when you came in.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A wizard friend set me up with that trick.&quot; The athlete leaned back in her chair. &quot;Do you have any, uh, tips? People have been clamouring for a sequel but....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I just... write the stories as they come to me.&quot; The other pegasus tightened her cloak. &quot;Nothing special. I mean, yeah, the books are famous...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot; Rainbow nodded. &quot;I&#039;ve been in my share of trapped ruins, though. Pretty accurate.&quot;</p><p class="double">The older mare&#039;s eyes snapped up. <i>Gotcha.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;You... make a habit of entering ruins?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not exactly.&quot; Rainbow sighed. &quot;See, I was selected a while back, by &#039;fate&#039; or whatever, to bear an ancient artefact known as the Element of Loyalty. Course, that means when I hear the world is in danger I just have to rush off and save it, you know? Ancient libraries and collapsed coliseums, they&#039;re just places where I do my part. It&#039;s not so much a habit as... coincidence.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hrmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash flicked her mane. &quot;Crazy thing is, a lot of the ruins seem like they came right out of the books you write. Down to the tiniest detail. It&#039;s as if Daring was actually, you know, <i>there.</i>&quot; She smiled beatifically. &quot;Of course, Daring Do is fiction, so obviously I must be wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I mean, I would be pissed if Daring Do was hiding all this from the public for some silly reason, like... money, or fame. Privacy, that&#039;s a little more understandable. Maybe if some of the artefacts in the book can brainwash ponies who know about it, yeah, I&#039;d get that. But knowing the world was in danger so often and I was being left on the sidelines?&quot; Dash shrugged. &quot;I sometimes wished she <i>was</i> real, just so I could thank her for her brave deeds... then smack her for passing them off as children&#039;s literature rather then forming some sort of group to, I dunno, keep the dangers under control.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My family can handle that,&quot; the pegasus said, then clamped her mouth shut.</p><p class="double">Dash raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;....fine. You got me. I&#039;m Daring Do. The books are all... exaggerated, but true.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash remained silent.</p><p class="double">&quot;The thing is...&quot; Daring took off the soft hat she was wearing, revealing her monochrome mane. &quot;Saving the world, archaeology... it doesn&#039;t pay well. I originally wrote the stories in private to tell some family members, you know, swap tales over the fireplace. Then some publisher saw my Sapphire Stone transcript.&quot; She flung her hoof out. &quot;&#039;&#039;Great story, miss, mind if I make you rich?&#039; I made a snap decision, called myself A.K. Yearling... They refused to believe it was nonfiction. And, over the years, it just... built up. I never meant for it to become famous...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Celestia appears in one of your books.&quot;</p><p class="double">Daring chuckled. &quot;Heh, yeah. That was when I realized that my adventures were really important. Of course it wasn&#039;t nearly how I wrote it. I was completely panicking. But....&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash smiled as the pegasus rambled on, putting a word in here and there while the tiny bit of plastic clipped to her mane recorded everything. Twilight would have a ball. Or freak out. Maybe both. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So... as far as I can figure, baseline you is supposed to get miffed about the two month delay, decides to &#039;help&#039; Yearling write her book faster, then discover that she&#039;s actually Daring Do and somehow stop the whole Rings of Scorchero thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked at Twilight sceptically. &quot;And you got all that from a few dozen loops?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmm. Yeah.&quot; Twilight coughed. &quot;Most of which were lonely loops, soooooo....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh. Please tell me you at least got the book.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn gave her friend a sheepish grin. &quot;It&#039;s still a couple expansion periods out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....CLOROPHYL.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.7</p><p class="double">Applebloom had checked very carefully.</p><p class="double">This Loop was only about thirty past a recent loop length increase, according to Twilight, which should mean it was a while until it lengthened again. With that in mind, the moment the loop ended could be known quite precisely.</p><p class="double">Helpful for a new alicorn who had no idea how to undo the transformation.</p><p class="double">So, in the full understanding that there were only two hours or so to go, Applebloom pulled Smart Cookie from her subspace pocket as the last rays of the sun slid off the Canterhorn.</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go...” she muttered, slipping the Device/Founder on and tightening the strap. “Tree-questria, but I feel nervous.”</p><p class="double"><i>That&#039;s only natural,</i> Cookie replied.</p><p class="double">Applebloom peered over the drop below her, and gulped. At least a furlong straight down, and then an increasingly gentle slope coated in soft, fluffy snow. (It helped that some confused pegasi had dumped three feet of snow on the mountain earlier that week.)</p><p class="double">“Right. No time like the present.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom closed her eyes, and broke into a run.</p><p class="double"><i>Now!</i></p><p class="double">Hearing Cookie&#039;s alert, she gathered her hooves below her and pushed. The leap took her up and out, into thin air... then down, past where she&#039;d taken off from.</p><p class="double">She shut out the nagging part of her mind that was screaming something about mortality. (She was a Looper, it was allowed.) She also shut out the bit telling her that she was doing something stupid, which was harder.</p><p class="double">Don&#039;t think about it. Think... back.</p><p class="double">Remember the moment of excitement, the feeling of epiphany. The shining instant when an entire world of the nanoscopic lay revealed before her. No more tricks or traps, no more surprises hiding in the woodwork.</p><p class="double">Just... an enormously complex machine. Nothing more.</p><p class="double">And with that, ride the wave of sudden understanding.</p><p class="double">There was a timeless sensation of <i>depth-</i></p><p class="double">And her eyes snapped open.</p><p class="double"><i>Good,</i> Cookie said encouragingly. <i>Now, bring your wings up at an acute angle, then turn them to bite the wind on the downstroke!</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom bared her teeth in what wasn&#039;t quite a grin, but was too good natured to be a grimace.</p><p class="double">The explanation helped, actually. Cookie probably knew almost everything about her, but one of the most important things was that “do this” wasn&#039;t nearly as satisfying without the why behind it.</p><p class="double">After a dozen or so quick, flailing wingbeats, Applebloom had her glide trajectory stable. A few more, slower and with more thought into them, had her in the updraught rising as the Canterhorn cut into the prevailing winds, and from there she just had to hold her wings out and ride the wind.</p><p class="double">For maybe half an hour she just floated, silently contemplating the country below.</p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen it from this high,</i> Cookie said eventually.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Applebloom asked, experimentally trimming her wings to tack around. She flubbed it, slipping sideways instead of turning, and gave up before things got worse. “Whoa... yeah, now I think of it we ain&#039;t gone flying much.”</p><p class="double"><i>I have noticed a certain tendency to be busy on other matters whenever you and Scootaloo take up one of your creations,</i> Cookie noted. <i>But... it&#039;s an amazing sight, really. All our hopes and dreams become reality.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom tried again. This time, the more gradual approach worked, and they swung out to face towards Ponyville.</p><p class="double"><i>Look at that,</i> Cookie said, sounding a bit distant.<i> Ponies did that. The argumentative, hardheaded, hidebound refugees from a land buried under an ice storm of their own making. We came here, and we built this. All of this. Together.</i></p><p class="double">Cookie&#039;s words made Applebloom look at Equestria with new eyes.</p><p class="double">From her time in other worlds, she&#039;d seen what the average medieval society looked like. How most worlds developed, in fire and death and war.</p><p class="double">Equestria... didn&#039;t do that. No, the citizens of the land spread out beneath her wings had no need to fear war and little need to fear hunger.</p><p class="double"><i>That</i> was the real achievement of Equestria.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For the next hour or so, the duo flew on over the star-speckled night below, mirroring Luna&#039;s canvas above.</p><p class="double">“Time&#039;s nearly up,” Applebloom commented softly.</p><p class="double"><i>I know. Time for me to go back in.</i></p><p class="double">“Sorry y&#039;all have to do this, and all, but... yeah, it has to be done.”</p><p class="double">With care, Applebloom returned Cookie to her subspace pocket. While Cookie could almost certainly ride out a loop reset and be resummoned from her shared place in Applebloom&#039;s soul, neither of them felt particularly inclined to test it out.</p><p class="double">Alone now, Applebloom checked the time once more.</p><p class="double">One minute left.</p><p class="double">Acting on a whim, she closed one wing, flipped over, and went into a dive.</p><p class="double">It was easy to see why Dash and Scoots loved speed so much. There was a thrill of adrenaline which you only really got when air was rushing past you, whipping at coat and mane and tail.</p><p class="double">She was nowhere near Sonic Rainboom speeds, of course – that tended to take a lot of effort even for experienced pegasi – but, well, it was fun.</p><p class="double">The last seconds of the Loop ticked away-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.8</p><p class="double">-and Applebloom Awoke, skidded on the floor as her galloping legs suddenly got confused, and ended up in a heap against the wall along with several other ponies.</p><p class="double">“Ah, horsefeathers,” she heard Scootaloo say. “That wasn&#039;t the smoothest awakening...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, stupid wings,” Sweetie muttered. “I got confused again and...”</p><p class="double">Sweetie tailed off.</p><p class="double">“Again?” Diamond Tiara asked, extricating herself from one end of the pile and coming into Applebloom&#039;s vision.</p><p class="double">She had a pair of wings, and a filly-scale <i>horn.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom felt her own wings itching, and pulled them out from underneath... probably Sweetie, from the direction of the voices... before getting off the others.</p><p class="double">She was an alicorn. In front of the others. Though, actually...</p><p class="double">Scootaloo had a new horn on top of her usual wings.</p><p class="double">Sweetie had wings, adding to her normal horn.</p><p class="double">She and Diamond had <i>both.</i></p><p class="double">And Nyx, now revealed to have been all but flattened underneath all four of them, was her everyday alicorn self.</p><p class="double">Relief ran through her. If this was a peculiarity of the loop, like that time Mac had been Princess Maccie, then she could retain her secret-</p><p class="double">Then what Diamond had said penetrated. Sweetie had had trouble with her wings <i>again?</i></p><p class="double">“It&#039;s nothing,” Sweetie said quickly. “Just a loop a while ago where I was a pegasus!”</p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t have been a while ago,” Tiara pointed out reasonably. “You&#039;d have told us, right?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie blushed.</p><p class="double">“Who ran me over?” Nyx asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">“I think all of us,” Scootaloo said. “Sorry. Anything damaged?”</p><p class="double">“Just bruises, I think...” Nyx twisted herself from lying on her side to on her front, then came to her hooves in a surge of movement. “Ow.”</p><p class="double">Tiara looked between them. “Hang on a minute... have you all ascended before as well?”</p><p class="double">“As well?” Applebloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo chorused.</p><p class="double">“Gourd, have we <i>all</i> been hiding it from one another?” Tiara sighed, as one by one all the others apart from Nyx nodded slowly. “Guess this is what happens when we don&#039;t want to make one another feel small... you know, if I was still the boasting type this would have gotten resolved a <i>lot</i> quicker.”</p><p class="double">“How long?” Applebloom asked, drawing the eyes of the others. “I mean, how long have you guys been... able to be alicorns,” she finished, looking down.</p><p class="double">“About five loops,” Scootaloo admitted. “Sorry, guys.”</p><p class="double">“Eight,” Sweetie said.</p><p class="double">“For me it was four,” Diamond Tiara said, sitting down.</p><p class="double">“Just two.” Applebloom shrugged, feeling even more uncomfortable. “It was the one with the nanotech, yeah. I kinda understated how complicated the nanotech was when I told you...”</p><p class="double">“I think we&#039;ve all been less than honest about our recent loops.” Diamond Tiara rubbed at her temples.</p><p class="double">“I haven&#039;t,” Nyx said brightly. The others glared at her.</p><p class="double">“...okay, sorry,” she added, shrinking back. “I kinda forgot how bad it makes you feel, when you think you&#039;ve let down your friends.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t-” Scootaloo started, then sighed. “Yeah, you&#039;re right. I do. And part of it is that that loop felt kind of like a dream. It all seemed so unreal, but when I tested it out... there it was.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s mouth twisted. “I didn&#039;t dare test whether I could do it again except at the end of the loop, because...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know the feeling,” Applebloom said, to the nods of the others.</p><p class="double">“Were you flying as well?” Sweetie asked.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shook her head. “Telekinesis spell. I&#039;ve seen you do it so often, Sweets, and I... it&#039;s so different to my cloud manipulation. I was concentrating on that when the loop changed, so I wasn&#039;t ready.”</p><p class="double">“I was flying,” Applebloom volunteered. “First time I&#039;d tried.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie smiled. “It&#039;s amazing, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">“Hey, this means I can teach you!” Scootaloo said with a grin. “Well, so long as being an alicorn myself means that I can actually manage level flight without magic...”</p><p class="double">“Far be it from me to interrupt,” Diamond Tiara said into the lull, “but what exactly about this loop made us all be alicorns?”</p><p class="double">They scanned the so-far-neglected loop memories.</p><p class="double">“...oh,” Nyx said, then giggled. “Poor Momma...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight carefully signed the final bit of paperwork for the day.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s done...”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, your majesty,” the seneschal said, lifting the pile in a magical grip.</p><p class="double">“No, thank <i>you,</i>” Queen Twilight rejoined. “I&#039;m grateful to you for your help. Now, I should go see what my... five daughters,” she said with a wince, “have managed to get up to during office hours.”</p><p class="double">Frankly, if they were all Awake, she was lucky the castle was still standing.</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>43.1 (Bobnik)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle sighed and shuffled a hoof. “I s&#039;pose it&#039;s story time. Since it sounds like I went first, I&#039;ll go first here too.”</p><p class="double">“No, no, not yet. If there&#039;s gonna be stories, I want snacks. Just like old times, in the clubhouse.” said Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">“I got this.” Nyx trotted over to the door and had words with a guard out in the corridor.</p><p class="double">Sometime later they sat around an array of healthy snacks and one cupcake each (it appeared Queen Mummy had given the kitchens some very specific instructions).</p><p class="double">“Okay,” began Sweetie Belle. “Mine didn&#039;t happen in Equestria. Lots of the others been to this place, but I didn&#039;t recognise it at first...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle opened her eyes and stared into what appeared to be a formless void. <i>Oookaayy,</i> she thought, and swiftly patted herself down to check it was just the void that was formless.</p><p class="double">Phew. Hooves, mane, tail, horn, various other bits, all present and correct. Her next considered action was to retrieve a jewelled necklace from her subspace pocket and fasten it securely around her neck.</p><p class="double">“Clover? You okay?” asked the unicorn, somewhat creeped out by the total lack of echo.</p><p class="double"><i>Yes, I&#039;m fine</i>, replied the Device. <i>Where are we? All I can sense is a formless void, and you.</p><p class="double"></i>“Oh good, I&#039;m not hallucinating. We might start things off with a search spell – did you hear that?”</p><p class="double"><i>Something, yes...</p><p class="double"></i>Both of them stayed silent as the merest whisper of sound began, and swelled imperceptibly slowly over time into music. And oh, what music it was; the very grandest of orchestras, with all the musical instruments Sweetie had ever heard and then some, all played by the greatest of virtuosos. It was joined by a choir of all the different voices that she could imagine, male and female, all up and down the scales.</p><p class="double">Sweetie&#039;s eyes widened as the realisation hit her – this was being performed live and improvised on the fly. The core theme was there, solid as bedrock, but all the voices and instruments were adding their own flourishes and additions. The music wove back and forth like life itself. She heard debates of philosophy, parties, storms, the happiness of new love, the solemn joy of a mountain vista and multitudes of other things beyond even her extensive experience. She somehow knew this music would stay with her and she would be able to hum the refrain for all the new things she would see in her life to come.</p><p class="double">It was too much. Music was in her heart and almost always in her cutie mark, itself an extension of her soul. With a deep breath and a hopeful heart she opened her mouth and joined the song.</p><p class="double">The reaction was immediate. Stern tones sung by baritone voices washed around her, interrogating. Drums and horns called warning that they were ready to defend. Sweetie very carefully restated the main theme in her own natural register, hoping to send the message that she didn&#039;t want to interrupt or hijack the marvelous music, but join in and add her own notes. Gradually, gently, the voices relented and the drums quieted. Lighter tones swirled around her and invited comment, granting inclusion. The unicorn was welcomed into the song.</p><p class="double">How long Sweetie sang she never knew, then or later. Entirely immersed, she sang along with the music, even adding her own themes, mostly about friends and family. However, it gradually became apparent that one of the male voices was trying to start up it&#039;s own version of the primary theme. It was loud and brash and very, very repetitive. The main singer wasn&#039;t letting it evolve, wasn&#039;t letting it grow and change like the earlier theme did.</p><p class="double">For the first time in what was probably an age, the filly fell silent and listened. In this new song she heard selfishness and foolish pride, the desire to be the best and a buried uncertainty as to the purpose of the singer. She heard the fear of change. There was Diamond Tiara before the loops, with cruelty to hide the low self esteem. There was the worst parts of Rarity, the greed for attention and reputation. Even herself, and her once-buried fear that she would never find her purpose, her talent, her cutie mark. Worse yet, a group of other voices were beginning to join in.</p><p class="double">No. No, she wouldn&#039;t let this happen. The music she&#039;d been part of was far too beautiful to allow this kind of thinking to take hold. Not while she drew breath.</p><p class="double">With renewed resolve she dove back into the song, weaving back and forth until she was hard up against the rogue choir. Sweetie didn&#039;t attack it directly because that would only make it stronger, but instead tried to weave the brassy notes into a foundation of a new theme. Every time though, her song faltered because the singers would not accept novelty or change. <i>You want stasis? You want everything to stay the same? Try this.</p><p class="double"></i>Clover responded to her unspoken thought, and became a harp under her hooves. Sweetie sang of unchanging repetition, the fundamental frustration of the Loops. She gave them her millennia of aggravation at being wrenched from the natural pattern of pony life, and the sorrow of family and friends who simply couldn&#039;t keep up. All of this was of the same core as the rogue song and merged with it seamlessly.</p><p class="double">Many of the voices split away and rejoined to original music; they could not accept the price of what Sweetie sang. But the original voice of the disharmony sang on, in foolish pride and stubbornness.</p><p class="double">The filly changed tack at this point. Already enmeshed with the music, she began to introduce the hope and joy that she had found in the Loops – new discoveries and new friends. How anything new and different was not a challenge to supremacy but one of adaptation. Harp became dulcimer became drums became flute became harmonica became hang as she adapted to the needs of the moment. Clover helped by weaving the sounds of the previous instruments back through Sweetie&#039;s current recital, showing how the old could be adapted to the new. Slowly but surely Sweetie Belle became her own orchestra.</p><p class="double">Pride and stubbornness broke, and the once loud voice became soft and tried to hide in shame and fear. This too, Sweetie would not accept; she bolstered the voice and provided support, inviting him to share in all the new wonders they could create together. Friendship did not just add but multiplied the possibilities – why would you settle for loneliness?</p><p class="double">It seemed the male voice agreed. It accepted her offer, and together they sang a new theme, drawing heavily from the original. This third music had all the strength of the male voice with the flexibility of Sweetie&#039;s, drawing in more voices and instruments until with a mighty crescendo of unity, the song came to an end.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle opened her eyes and blinked. Around her now was a court filled with humanoid creatures. Kneeling before her was one of the larger and more impressive looking men, with tears running down his cheeks.</p><p class="double">“Thank you, whoever and whatever you may be; you have saved from a path of great darkness.” he whispered. Sweetie did not reply with words, instead she just hugged him.</p><p class="double">At an unseen signal, the crowds drew back allowing Sweetie to see a great throne at the centre of the hall. A man rose from it, and in his eyes was fire and wisdom.</p><p class="double">“I am Illuvatar,” he said. “I wrote the core of the music you have sung, and as I wrote I saw horses, and creatures with horns, and beasts with feathered wings. But never did I see them all in one form. Though I do not wish to be rude, for you have taught Melkor what I could not, I must ask: Who and what are you, and from whence did you come?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Sweetie Belle.” <i>Wait, WINGS?</p><p class="double"></i>She looked down the sides of her body and sure enough, a pair of wings were there.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, eucalyptus. How am I going to explain this to everypony?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“So then I kinda had to explain all about the loops, &#039;cause I&#039;d already sung about them. Everyone was like &#039;How can this be?&#039; except for Olorin, turns out this was like his fiftieth loop. Pretty sure he&#039;s the anchor.” Sweetie paused for a sip of apple juice. “I didn&#039;t really have time to think about being an alicorn then, but it came in handy later.”</p><p class="double">“How so?” asked Applebloom. “Was it because the Middle Earth loops are dangerous? Ah&#039;ve heard they can get pretty bad with nasty soul magic and stuff.”</p><p class="double">“Nope, nipped all that in the bud by making friends with Melkor. It was because of time; Middle Earth lasts for tens of thousands of years. I wouldn&#039;t have lived to see the first sunrise without it.”</p><p class="double">The other fillies stared at her. “You&#039;ve already spent millennia as a alicorn?” asked Applebloom in a faint voice.</p><p class="double">“Well what else was I supposed to do? I&#039;m not even sure if you can use Star Swirl&#039;s spell without being a Bearer of Harmony. So whose turn is it now?” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">43.2</p><p class="double">“Right.” Scootaloo polished off her cupcake. “My turn, I think.”</p><p class="double">She broke off, and looked down at the cupcake. “Okay, seriously, does... well, mom... have Pinkie or the Cake family on staff? That was delicious.”</p><p class="double">Nyx frowned. “I think she might have <i>a</i> Pie or <i>a</i> Cake on staff, past loops are strange like that.”</p><p class="double">“So, spill,” Sweetie said, lying on her front and putting her head on her hooves. “What <i>did</i> you do? Scoot through time?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Scootaloo shook her head. “Nothing so simple as that. But it <i>did</i> work with what always tends to be my Talent.”</p><p class="double">“I think it did for all of us...” Applebloom hazarded. Diamond looked a bit ambivalent, but after a moment nodded more firmly.</p><p class="double">“Right. So, we had a school trip...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo was bored. Pony was she ever! Twilight was awake, obviously, but it seemed like every other looper she knew had decided to sit this one out, including the Crusaders and Dash. At least she had Pansy to talk to, inside her own head. As they were walking through the Weather factory in Cloudsdale, that&#039;s exactly what they were doing.</p><p class="double"><i>This is amazing!</i> The Founder turned Device exclaimed, using her awareness to sightsee. <i>The pegasi of my time would never have conceived of weather construction on such a scale!</p><p class="double">It is kind of cool.</i> Scootaloo rarely ended up in Cloudsdale, even now that flying was no longer an issue. Even with some of the things she&#039;d seen in other loops, the giant cloud generators and rainbow distillation towers were pretty cool. <i>It&#039;s a change from doing the Canterlot Gardens tour. The last time the three of us did that we decided to fix Discord with a bucket of liquid rainbow, some cloud and a feather...</p><p class="double"></i>She trailed off as her brief good mood faded, and she looked back and forth between her non-Awake friends, or... ponies who just looked like them. How Twilight had coped when she was alone her first few hundred loops she didn&#039;t know, and never wanted to find out.</p><p class="double">Pansy had clearly spotted her incipient black mood, and tried to head it off by talking about something else. <i>So why did Miss Cheerilee bring you here instead, anyway?</p><p class="double"></i>Scootaloo looked ahead to where their teacher was leading the pack and talking to the guide. <i>She realised that since we have a unicorn in town who could mass cast a Cloudwalking spell, it would be educational to come see how weather was made. We got delayed due to freaky weather, and then Twilight and Dash got called off to Canterlot, which says Discord is about on time...</p><p class="double">I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re so blasé about that creature!</i> There was the sharper tone of the soldier Lieutenant Pensee had been, and still was in a way, came through in her mental voice. Scootaloo had learned a lot about pegasus fighting techniques from the ex-Founder, and more about military theory. Considering the number of times she&#039;d been dumped into a fused loop as a fighter pilot, or mechanised soldier, it seemed like a good idea.</p><p class="double"><i>Discord&#039;s mellowed out a lot when he&#039;s awake, and when he&#039;s not, Dash or Twilight can handle him like small change. They&#039;re probably already duking it out with him, Twilight said something about seeing if the non-awake Elements could resist him...</p><p class="double"></i>They were walking out across a suspended walkway across a vast hangar where rows of massive rain clouds were ranked like dirigibles, undergoing final quality control inspections before being shipped out. Suddenly there were screams from the floor as two of the larger clouds sprouted arms, legs and faces, and stood up, slamming the other clouds to bits as they howled like Windigoes.</p><p class="double">There were plenty of screams and whimpers from up on the balcony too. As Miss Cheerilee called for her class to calm down and get together, in preparation for making like a North wind and blowing this place, the cloud workers got their act together and tried to marshal the two cloud creatures with cloud prods and blasts of air driven by groups of pegasi wings.</p><p class="double">In response, the two monsters turned and vomited high pressure jets of liquid rainbow from the dark holes that served them as mouths. They blasted the workers away and plastered them against the walls of the hangar, trapped like flies in polychromatic amber. Then one started to turn towards the gantry, and the panic increased. They were never going to get off the walkway in time without a distraction...</p><p class="double">Scootaloo wasn&#039;t really thinking, just reacting as she realised this. She spun on her forehooves, bucked a cloud board covered with production schedules – snapping it off its support – and yelled out, &quot;Bloom, Sweetie! Get the others clear! I&#039;ll cover you!&quot;</p><p class="double">She sprang up, wings buzzing as she backflipped onto the board in mid-air and spun it round to face the monsters, even as she started to fall. She waved her wings and forelegs, hollering &quot;Hey, look, a distraction!&quot;</p><p class="double">It worked, the monster turning its attention from the frantic foals on the walkway to the descending pegasus and spitting it&#039;s rainbowy goodness at her. Scootaloo used her improbable acrobatic skills to evade, strafing from side to side and bouncing off scraps of the destroyed clouds to arrest her fall and change direction.</p><p class="double"><i>What are you doing!</i> Pansy exclaimed in her head.</p><p class="double"><i>Improvising!</i> Scootaloo replied with the small faction of her mind that wasn&#039;t focussed on not getting hit. <i>Could use some help...</p><p class="double"></i>Pansy&#039;s default necklace form appeared around her neck and the improvised surf board took on a much sleeker form factor. Both creatures had spotted her now, and were alternating between bursts of rainbow and clumps of cloud from the ends of their arms big enough to engulf her if they&#039;d hit. Not that they would, as she&#039;d reached the ground level and was skimming back and forth amongst their feet with her wings buzzing. </p><p class="double">Her new ride wasn&#039;t a scooter, or the custom Extreme Gear Apple Bloom had made for her, but with Pansy helping her support the shape and cushion it against contact with the cloud floor it made a dandy substitute. She could feel the board under her hooves as if it was a part of her, the kinesthesia that made her such a skilled acrobat mixing with her pegasus cloud control abilities to extend into the cloud board itself.</p><p class="double"><i>Your friends are getting every-pony to safety, </i>Pansy&#039;s voice spoke in her mind. <i>If you wish to continue this, we should lead these things away from them.&#039;</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;On it!&quot; Scootaloo chirped, and swept around in a curve to head towards the door of the hangar. Still weaving and jinking to evade their attacks, she pushed out her cloud sense further into the cloudstuff that made up the floor. The hangar doorway opened out onto a wide gap, a dock where a cloud could be moored, between it and the next quay, which lead towards a warehouse. The cloud at the edge of the hangar rippled and shifted, forming a ramp leading off into the void and a lip to either side.</p><p class="double">The cloud monsters stomped after her, shapeless hoofs raising sprays of cloud and &#039;poomph&#039; sounds as they hit the floor. Scootaloo put on a burst of speed and went scooting up the ramp, soaring out into open air. She could fly, but as long as she just used ground effect stuff she could push all that extra effort into manoeuvring. </p><p class="double">She glanced behind her with a grin as the two cloud monsters reached the edge and tripped on the low wall she&#039;d formed, falling forward with windmilling arms. The grin faded as they simply floated forward off the edge, swimming after her. She could sense Pansy&#039;s mental smirk, and huffed &quot;Okay, I know, clouds, they can fly! But you&#039;ve gotta admit, it looked cool!&quot;</p><p class="double">She landed on the far dock and forced the cloudstuff on the far edge into a quarter-pipe ramp which she used to change direction, skirting up and grinding along the edge. A bolt of lightning disintegrated the cloud stuff directly behind her, telling her the stakes had just gone up. She frantically veered and weaved as she shot forward onto the main cloud yard in front of the warehouse. </p><p class="double"><i>We must not allow those things to get in among other ponies! </i>Pansy advised<i>. Though why there are no guards come to help I don&#039;t know.</p><p class="double"></i>As Scootaloo dodged a particularly nasty lightning bolt, she nodded towards the main bulk of Cloudsdale, visible over the warehouse. Even from here there were audible screams and sounds of panic. &quot;I guess they have their hooves full. Which means it&#039;s up to us...&quot;</p><p class="double">She dipped her wings, letting momentum carry her forward and body weight move her from side to side. She touched the wingtips to the ground and cloud scraped up to coat her wings and spread over her body. In seconds she&#039;d formed a layer of cloud armour over her leading edges and body, and Pansy poured power into it, making it as resilient as crystal. </p><p class="double">Using her wings to renew her speed, she then flipped end for end and swept her wings forward and flung a pair of Vortex Strikes, one of her standard attacks from her Jewellery Scout days, focussed bursts of air that could punch through wood – or even stone – or simply knock back an enemy. In this case they blasted holes right through one monster&#039;s torso, which healed up quickly.</p><p class="double">Pansy was watching through her eyes, noting the pattern in which they fired off lightning bolts. <i>They have a rigid pattern of attacks, and seem simplistic automatons. If only we could exploit that regularity...</p><p class="double"></i>A near miss with a lightning bolt frizzed her mane, and Pansy said, <i>Warehouse wall approaching!</p><p class="double"></i>Suddenly Scootaloo had an idea. &quot;That may be just what we need!&quot;</p><p class="double">She mentally threw the idea at Pansy and got back a mix of agreement, admiration and incredulity.</p><p class="double"><i>It will take precise timing...</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;Timing I can do...&quot; She flipped back and sped up, reaching down into the underlying cloud to twist the warehouse wall into a ramp that curved up and over in a soaring arc. Even as it stabilised, she hit the ramp and shot up it, gaining speed and feeling the beat as the blasts kept coming. Arcing into the open air, she tumbled and spun to keep herself from getting hit while keeping her path on course and on time.</p><p class="double">She fell between the heads of the cloud monsters just as their blank eyes charged with arcs of lightning, and the two creatures ended up blasting each other in the head. Scootaloo had hoped simply to disorient them, put them off balance long enough for Pansy to set up and go full Device, but it seemed that whatever else, they weren&#039;t immune to each other&#039;s lightning blasts.</p><p class="double">Each disintegrated the other&#039;s head, and the two bodies wobbled and collapsed, with Scootaloo shooting out from between them even as they disintegrated into tufts of cloud rubble. She swung sideways and skidded to a stop, spraying up a fan of cloud stuff that evaporated away in a sparkle of rainbows.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! That&#039;s what you get! Coming along here all big and bad and scaring every-pony! Well who&#039;s the pony? Yeah! Who&#039;s the pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled out an all-day sucker she&#039;d been saving from her saddlebag and popped it in her mouth, grateful for the sugar boost. &quot;Now that&#039;s what I call weather control.&quot;</p><p class="double">The cloud underhoof shook, and she groaned. &quot;Oh great! Not more of them!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy&#039;s voice spoke, and she felt her attention being directed to the rest of Cloudsdale. <i>I think it&#039;s rather more serious...</i> The topless towers were shuddering and leaning, and the very cloud under her hooves started to sink like an express elevator.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no! Dash must have refused her wings back! But I never thought Discord would actually do it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy could read her thoughts and the memories behind them as they flashed through her brain. Her voice was grim as she responded. <i>Then we must think of something with the utmost speed, or Cloudsdale will fall!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>For a few seconds, Scootaloo wondered if her crystalline advisor wasn’t being a little over-dramatic. After the initial shock, she remembered that Cloudsdale was inhabited by pegasi, and therefore they could escape. And falling clouds weren’t amongst the most lethal of objects. And even if Cloudsdale was destroyed, the multi-coloured reset button (a.k.a The Elements) would fix it as soon as they were used. Then she thought of her class and the other non-pegasi, would they get to a flying cart or safe cloud in time…</p><p class="double">She suddenly noticed a certain lightness just behind her shoulder blades, and saw the specks of distant pegasi abruptly stagger in mid-air and plummet downwards. Thankfully they were over the city proper, and should at least have a soft landing. The same couldn’t be said for the city. They were dropping out of the sky and drifting southwards as they did, towards the rocky chaparral that was bisected by Ghastly Gorge.</p><p class="double">As a final counterpoint to the distant destruction, one of the storage towers near the warehouse collapsed, and liquid rainbow started leaking out, eating away at the cloud-stuff under it. It was a highly useful by-product of cloud manufacture, with dozens of alchemical and industrial uses, and it was also extremely volatile under the right or rather wrong conditions. Scootaloo had learned great respect for the substance after several attempts by Apple Bloom to use it as a mono-propellant in some of her sounding rockets, with mixed and frequently Trixie-worthy results.</p><p class="double">While she’d only been listening with half an ear during the tour, she knew that the weather factory had millions of litres of the stuff in storage, along with storm clouds freshly charged with lightning and massive cloud crystal accumulators chock full of the weather magic to run the weather-making processes. When this thing hit the ground, all that would be jumbled together, and she had no idea what would happen… actually she had an excellent idea, what she wasn’t sure of was just how big the blast radius would be.</p><p class="double">It seemed whatever the Elements had done had infuriated the Avatar of Chaos way beyond normal. He hadn’t killed anypony yet, probably because dead things were no fun to abuse, but it looked like he wanted to. For just a second, Scootaloo felt despair wash over her, the position seemed as hopeless as any she’d ever been in, and even if the loops would reset it, here and now these ponies, her friends would die.</p><p class="double">She felt ashamed of her earlier dismissiveness, these versions of Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle – even Diamond Tiara – might not be the ones she’d lived out the loops with, but they were her friends in this time and place… well, perhaps not base-line DT, but looping DT had given them a bunch of advice on how to deflect her… but that wasn&#039;t important now. Anyway, she wouldn’t leave even base-line DT to such a fate, not that she herself wouldn’t share it. But that wasn’t important, the only important things was to protect the others, no matter the cost.</p><p class="double">Her teeth gritted and her anger rose. Take away her wings? Ha, she’d spent centuries without the power of flight, she could cope. Part of her ability to manoeuvre her scooter came from the fact that being unable to fully express her power through her wings, she’d compensated by pushing it through her hooves, making her scooter a part of her flight magic. It also meant, after untold years of practice she was <i>really</i> talented at cloud manipulation, which was how she’d pulled those stunts.</p><p class="double">That gave her an idea. After all, Cloudsdale was just a giant cloud when all was said and done. Maybe… She pushed her store of magic as deeply into the cloud as she could, and felt it as if it was a part of her hooves, but only the yard and some surrounding buildings. Her thoughts had only taken a few seconds, but even so she could feel the ancient weather magic weakening. She tried to fill the gap... and her power alone wasn&#039;t enough.</p><p class="double">“Pansy, help me!” The Founder within the Device added her own magic and that of the one-time sapphire, now transformed to something other by the magic of an Alicorn Creator. Scootaloo felt her reach expand, but it was tenuous, weak, feeble. She could feel the hooves of panicking pegasi, sense the terror, even where her class cowered near where their hired dirigible had been. But she couldn’t affect the cloud, as soon as she tried it vanished from her grasp like smoke.</p><p class="double">She needed a better connection, and Pansy offered an idea as to what, something ancient pegasi warriors had done in battle. Scootaloo hadn’t taken classes with Zecora, but she’d picked up enough from Apple Bloom to see why it might work. Her magic twisted slightly, and an icy spike punched up from the cloud in front of her. Wincing in advance, she brought the hock of one foreleg on it’s point, puncturing her skin and allowing a trickle of blood to form from the wound.</p><p class="double">She rubbed her free fore-hoof in it, then rubbed the bases of the hooves together before slamming them into the cloud again. Sacrifice, giving something to get something. Sympathy, the water, magic and iron in her blood mingled with the water and magic of the cloud, making it a part of her and her a part of it. Contagion, every droplet of Cloudsdale had been in contact at some point, and now her blood, was a part of that. Identity, the magic she was pouring into the clouds flowed outwards in a torrent, diffusing to the furthest reaches of the city. She no longer felt Cloudsdale under her hooves, she <i>was</i> Cloudsdale.</p><p class="double">The sensation staggered her for a moment, then she accepted it and flexed her non-existent wings, straining to impose her will on the vast expanse of cloud and slowing the city&#039;s descent as two suburbs extended fans of cloud to either side. Then she threw every scrap of power she had into creating upward thrust. She&#039;d once created a hypersonic lifting body ramjet out of pure weather magic, and driving the air flow underneath the city to push it up was a similar thing on a much bigger scale.</p><p class="double">Her new awareness also let her sense the tens of thousands of wingless pegasi running around and panicking, not to mention her own class - abandoned by their dirigible, and huddled near the airship docks. The rate of descent had slowed, but she couldn&#039;t create enough thrust to arrest it and they were still dropping at far to high a speed, and running out of sky.</p><p class="double">She needed to gain more control, more lift and calm ponies. Unfortunately Cloudsdale was about as aerodynamic as a brick... Wait, could she even do that? Well, there was only one way to find out. She shifted some of her power into moving the section of cloud she was on. It was like shoving a mountain with her bare hooves, but it moved, just as she&#039;d sculpted the wings earlier.</p><p class="double">She focussed a tiny amount of magic into a structured wind spell, and throughout the city, ponies heard a sensible sounding mare&#039;s voice. “Emergency recovery procedures now in effect. All ponies must secure themselves. Prepare for modular transformation. Converting Cloudsdale to aerodynamic flight mode.”</p><p class="double">Driven by her magic, pads of cloud complete with girth straps popped up like mushrooms across the length and breadth of Cloudsdale. As Scootaloo hoped the suggestion of doing something, anything brought them out of their panic. Ponies started strapping themselves, or helping foals or elderly ponies who were having trouble. Now she just had to pull off the rest of it. She&#039;d flown the Marecross once, which is what had given her the idea. She pulled a pair of goggles once given to her by Rainbow Dash out of her subspace pocket manifesting them on her forehead. She slid them down and was ready for action.</p><p class="double">Sections of Cloudsdale shifted over one another, reconfiguring themselves as they formed a new shape, a broad wedge with a contoured underside, the bottom half of a lifting body. The buildings above spoilt the effect, but Scootaloo had probed the contents of the warehouse and had a plan for that. It&#039;s doors flew open and bolt after bolt of finely woven cirrus flew out under tightly controlled winds, flying up and unrolling to cover all of Cloudsdale in a TPing of the gods. However, rather than sinking down they stayed up, acting as pathways for Scootaloo&#039;s power, being supported and supporting it.</p><p class="double">In a few more seconds they&#039;d formed a sculpted dome to match the underside, the top half of a broad, wedge shaped lifting body. The big cloud generators had been shifted to the back and were running full tilt, not generating enough thrust to push that lift positive, but enough to help slow their rate of descent still further to a gentle powered glide. It also allowed her to focus her own weather magic on holding the whole thing together, and providing guidance.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo now stood at the prow of the wedge, looking forward. Her awareness was entirely focussed on the clouds around her, at one with Cloudsdale as she poured her very soul into guiding it. If she&#039;d been able to look at herself, she likely wouldn&#039;t have recognised herself, weather magic swirling in blue and white outlines around her, creating the highlights of a non-existent pair of wings and a horn.</p><p class="double">They were still heading over Ghastly Gorge, almost following it&#039;s line. If they fell across it, even Scootaloo&#039;s efforts wouldn&#039;t prevent the city from breaking its spine. She had to get away, either land it in the dessert north of Appleoosa, or bring it all the way round and go for the fields north of Ponyville. The first was easier, but it would leave them stranded well out in the dessert, far away from rescue, whereas the second would put them close to Ponyville and the Elements which could fix things, as well as a more hospitable environment for the already abused cloud-stuff.</p><p class="double">She made the decision, it looked like she was going home. She gathered her will and altered the shape of the clouds slightly, and Cloudsdale tilted slightly and began to come round in a gentle curve. Much as she&#039;d love to do a screaming turn, that would wreck the cloud structure and injure ponies. As she felt trepidation rise in the other ponies, she broadcast another message with a gentle breeze.</p><p class="double">“Cloudsdale is making a circle to the north. Seeking safe landing zone. Please remain secured.”</p><p class="double">She&#039;d turned to port to bring the city out over the open desert, and reconfigured the underside and wings to grab every extra pound of lift from the thermals rising off the hot sands. For the first time, Cloudsdale was actually rising. She took advantage of it by making a miles wide circle to grab as much height as possible before heading north.</p><p class="double">The stress of sustaining the city and controlling it&#039;s movement were telling on her, but she refused to acknowledge it. Her body felt like it was burning with a cold fire, and it was getting harder to stand, but she was going to stay the course, whatever it took. The sense of Pansy&#039;s will merging along with hers, equally steadfast, kept her going, that and the sense that her friends were safe.</p><p class="double">They swept north across the Everfree forest, and for once it seemed to help, the chaotic magic of the place flowing into her. She drew on it as she had everything that would sustain her a few moments more. In moments Ponyville came into sight, relatively unaffected by chaos, which implied Twilight had kept things contained around Canterlot. However, there was a problem. She&#039;d flown everything from a Sopwith Camel to a Star Destroyer (New Republic) and instincts from decades of flight time said it wasn&#039;t going to get her clear over Ponyville. She had to find a few more seconds of hang time...</p><p class="double">Her eyes lighted on the cotton candy clouds – those could work! Finding reserves she never realised she had, she reconfigured on of the cloud generators back to it&#039;s original purpose and thrust it out on a pylon overhead, pointing at the clouds. It spat out tightly wadded balls of cloud, containing the Everfree magic she&#039;d just absorbed, which hit the cotton candy clouds and exploded in a precise formation. Together they formed a ramp, wide enough to support Cloudsdale.</p><p class="double"><i>One last effort! </i>she thought at Pansy, and got a wordless affirmation. Tweaking the trajectory of the descending city, she put everything she had into giving it one last shunt as they hit the edge of the ramp. She&#039;d done the same on her scooter countless times, and that reflex served her well now. The city hit the ramp and shunted up, soaring over Ponyville with metres to spare.</p><p class="double">But that last effort had hammered the pegasus at the centre of it all. She collapsed, wings sagging to the cloud as a wave of fatigue hit her. Even her head seemed heavier than usual. But she held onto consciousness by the skin of her teeth, or there was one last danger. As it was they would land in a high speed uncontrolled skid, and the entire city might topple or even roll over, or the cloud stuff might rip apart. There was no landing gear to lower, however there were other ways.</p><p class="double">But she found just enough energy to make one more change. The under-surface shifted, sides coming down to form a flattened arch as the city reached only metres above the grass. The front edge was sculpted upwards to form a venturi that would scoop air underneath. The city kissed the ground and kept going, surfing along on the ground effect as the dome peeled away and formed a vast parachute behind it.</p><p class="double">The city slowed, dropping as its speed went below stalling for the ground effect, but by that time they&#039;d almost stopped. They finally came to a rest on the meadows beyond Ponyville and Scootaloo collapsed. “Thank you for flying Cloudsdale airlines...” she mumbled muzzily.</p><p class="double">She was utterly spent, barely able to breath. The last time she&#039;d felt like this, she&#039;d been dying. When she glanced down at Pansy, even the gem at it&#039;s heart seemed dull and lustreless. But she sensed rather than heard Pansy&#039;s proud whisper, <i>Well done soldier. Well done...</i> Her last memory before she faded out was of using her fading awareness of the city to check on her friends and her class, and finding them safe. It was more than a fair trade.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She awoke, and heard the sounds of distinctly medical beeping in the background. The ceiling that came into focus had an equally medical appearance. Not Ponyville central, this looked more cloud based. That, and the lack of new loop memories hitting her implied something she wouldn&#039;t have put a plugged bit on, that her awakening came with a small &#039;A&#039;.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not dead?” she asked, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p class="double">“Nope! But you gave it your best effort!” Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice responded. “Worst case of magical exhaustion the docs ever saw. Luckily Twilight came up with a way of transferring some of my magic into you, something about being kindred spirits. Though I don&#039;t know if even I&#039;d have been crazy enough to try fly a city to safety!”</p><p class="double">Her voice turned serious. “Seriously, thanks, kiddo... Scootaloo. I never thought even Discord would do something like that. I&#039;d have never forgiven myself if saving Equestria came at the cost of destroying Cloudsdale... Oh, that&#039;s right! You don&#039;t know what was going on...”</p><p class="double">She finally turned her head to look, and there were her parents -she had parents this time, not a sure thing – Twilight, and of course Rainbow Dash. She realised her neck was bare, and sent a frantic thought inwards. <i>Pansy! Are you okay?</p><p class="double"></i>The Founders voice was weak, but steady. <i>Fine, though don&#039;t expect anything above a light show for the rest of the loop. I dropped back into your subspace pocket when you fell unconscious. Besides, you have other things to worry about.</p><p class="double"></i>Dash had stepped back and let her parents in. There was a tearful reunion, with adequate helpings of hugs. However, she could sense there was something they weren&#039;t telling her. Plus they seemed to be avoiding looking at her forehead. It certainly ached, she must have hit her head on something because it felt like there was a lump there. The pain on her fore-leg was more easily explained.</p><p class="double">Finally a nurse shooed them out, except for Twilight who said something about being on the Princesses&#039; orders. When the nurse left, she turned to Scootaloo and said, “I&#039;m sorry, so sorry you had to go through that. I had no idea this version of Discord would be so crazy-mean! He was more like Sombra, and when we finally hit him with the Elements he was completely destroyed. I don&#039;t know why, something different about his imprisonment, but that&#039;s not important right now.”</p><p class="double">“Well you could make it up to me by getting me a headache potion, I don&#039;t know how I hit my head so hard, but it hurts...” She managed to raise a hoof to her forehead, and found something she didn&#039;t expect.</p><p class="double">“I convinced them not to say anything right away, that I was the best person to help you. You&#039;re just feeling a bad case of magic burn from overloading your horn. It should clear up in a day or so.” A potion plopped into existence on the bedside table and Scootaloo eagerly scooped it up, popping the cork and gulping it down.</p><p class="double">“How...” The potion took away her aches and pains, but the question remained.</p><p class="double">“You pushed your powers to their very limits and beyond. Your Device is at least as powerful as a single Element, part alicorn magic and even part chaos as the alicorn in question was created by Discord&#039;s power. That was probably why you could affect things, his magic recognised it&#039;s own.”</p><p class="double">“Did I get a cutie-mark too?” Scootaloo automatically glanced towards her covered flank.</p><p class="double">“A cloud with a rainbow contrail.”</p><p class="double">“Oh foaly horse-apples! How many ponies know I flew the city?”</p><p class="double">“Language!” Twilight shook her head. “Pretty much all of Cloudsdale. Every-pony felt your weather magic flowing through the clouds, and it was easy to trace back to the source. It was probably the only reason they got you to the hospital in time to save your life. They&#039;re talking about asking you to be Princess of Cloudsdale, with a statue even.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo winced. “This just keeps getting better and better. Can you imagine what Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom will say? Not just the local ones, but the loopers? Please, you have to promise that you won&#039;t tell them. It resets when the loop does, right?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Yes. However, I want to add a proviso. If they become alicorns too, then I can tell them.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo thought for a moment, then said, “Okay, but it has to be all of them, Diamond Tiara too. She&#039;s one of us now, and I don&#039;t want her feeling left out.”</p><p class="double">“Agreed.” Twilight nodded. “As for your friends here and now, have faith in them. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll support you too. And I&#039;ll be here to help you when your magic recovers. For now, sleep. You&#039;ve earned it.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Addendum (Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Before the hoof stomping could begin in earnest Princess Luna stepped forward, wings spread for attention. &quot;Before all can honour these Six Heroes, there is one more that must join their number in being recognized.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna lowered her wings. She wasn&#039;t using the full Royal Canterlot Voice, but enough of it to be clearly heard in even to the ponies standing outside the hall. &quot;When Discord found his scheme thwarted he sought to wreck a terrible carnage in revenge. He stole the wings off all the pegasi of Cloudsdale and set the city itself to fall. Certain whom the plummet did not slay the uncontrolled mixing of weather magics would.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna paused, not all had heard how dire Discord&#039;s finals acts had been, most having been confined to a relatively small area and relegated by tails to vicious pranks. &quot;But like the Legions of her ancestors one Filly would loudly shout NEIGH to the Beast&#039;s foul plan. None would come to harm while she still drew breath. So she pushed her weather magic and by her blood and will forged a miracle. She protected and comforted the fear of all in Cloudsdale, bringing the city in for a landing so that there was only one serious injury. That being herself, stretching her life and magic beyond any sane limits in the protection of others.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia hid a smile, Luna was truly a master storyteller still. Her duskier sister continued, &quot;Those who saw her said the magic glowed like a falling star. But her story would not end in the tragedy of such. Many laboured to heal her, and today I ask that Scootaloo Windfall, Protectress of the Open Skies step forth, to accept the thanks of those she saved.&quot;</p><p class="double">The main doors opened once more, and a filly alicorn stepped forth. The Pegasi and Nocturne Guards at the beginning of the aisle bowed deeply. Scootaloo had put her hoof down on more frilly outfits and adornment. Fortunately Luna had agreed and she was dressed in an outfit more like one of the Pegasi founders. Though more historically inclined ponies would notice the styling was closer to Private Pansy&#039;s than Commander Hurricane&#039;s. Her attempt to bow to the Diarachs was interrupted by Celestia&#039;s raised hoof. &quot;On this day you do not bow Scootaloo, we bow to you in thanks for saving Our little Ponies when we could not.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then to the shock of the herd, the Diarachs did just that. Then upon raising Luna&#039;s magic put a crown on her that somewhat resembled an open pegasi city-state helm. Presciently Rainbow Dash had been placed to Scootaloo&#039;s left in the ceremony. The older mare nudged her with a wing, &quot;Roll with the turbulence Scoots. Like Pinkie once told me parties like this are an excuse for everypony to celebrate they got to live through the danger.&quot;</p><p class="double">This advice was nearly undone when Celestia unveiled TWO windows in the Hall of Harmony. The first showed the stylized Bearers defeating Discord, the later engulfed in a mushroom cloud explosion. The artist was good, you could subtly see the various parts spread out at the edges of the blast. High above was... the lower surface of a lifting body?</p><p class="double">With a sinking stomach Scootaloo turned to the next window, which in a lower corner had Discord&#039;s defeat. The main area of the window was taken up by the reshaped Cloudsdale, Pegasis represented by wings turning to wisps of clouds. Her preascension self was standing like a figurehead on the prow. The artist even worked the glowing of magic to suggest her current horn, and her wing &#039;cloud wisps&#039; were larger and more solid looking. The impression that hers were growing and the artist was capturing the moment of ascension.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo fought off the urge to facehoof. &quot;The Crusaders are never going to let me live this window down.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">43.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Diamond said, nibbling on some lettuce. “I&#039;m pretty sure this was some kind of minor variant, just so you know.”</p><p class="double">“Join the club,” Scootaloo muttered.</p><p class="double">“Yes, we&#039;ve heard you,” Diamond replied. “It&#039;s my turn now. I&#039;m not just the daughter of a very rich pony now, you know, I&#039;m a Princess!”</p><p class="double">“And?” Applebloom, Sweetie Belle and Nyx chorused.</p><p class="double">“...okay, point made.” Diamond nodded, before pursing her lips. A little giggle escaped in spite of her best efforts.</p><p class="double">“Okay, okay, get to the action already!” Scootaloo said.</p><p class="double">“Right. Anyway. So.” Sitting down, Diamond looked along the row of... her four sisters, this time. (That was going to take some getting used to, and then probably a lot more un-getting-used-to.)</p><p class="double">“At first, it was fairly normal stuff. Just Twilight, Spike and I were Awake, so I spent a fair bit of the early loop comparing notes with him about telepathy. We were pretty sure I was up to P-3 or 4 on the scale, but that&#039;s not all that surprising with the amount of practise I&#039;ve been getting.”</p><p class="double">She waited for them to nod their achnowledgement.</p><p class="double">“The other project I had was basically trying to find some good, high quality crystals which might be suitable for a lightsaber.”</p><p class="double">“Isn&#039;t that my sister&#039;s thing?” Sweetie asked, then blushed. “Er, my normal sister, I mean.”</p><p class="double">“Ah&#039;m confused...” Applebloom frowned. “Are y&#039;all all Apples now, or am ah a Sparkle?”</p><p class="double">“We may be getting off topic,” Tiara reminded them. “Anyway. The reason was that Spike mentioned he&#039;d like a spare, and I wanted to... well, do something nice for him. It&#039;s that whole thing with a gift you&#039;ve put effort into, which isn&#039;t exactly a strong point of mine.”</p><p class="double">“Eh, you&#039;re getting better,” Applebloom said critically. “Though, t&#039; be honest, y&#039;all sharing your allowance helps too, we plumb don&#039;t have that much buying power most loops.”</p><p class="double">Diamond looked down. “Thanks,” she said, with a little catch in her voice. “It&#039;s nothing.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo made a sound of disagreement. “It&#039;s not nothing. It certainly helps me, for a start...”</p><p class="double">The pink alicorn nodded wordlessly.</p><p class="double">“So,” she said after a few seconds, her voice a little stronger. “Father and I went off to the frozen north on a skiing holiday I&#039;d asked for, so I could get a good look at somewhere that might be promising. And while we were there, the Crystal Empire returned not a furlong away from us. Of course I knew it came back, but it was so <i>close</i>...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is amazing,” Filthy Rich said, looking around the streets of the Empire. “It&#039;s like something from a story book – an empire from a thousand years ago!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Tiara replied, trying to be as enthusiastic as she <i>should</i> be feeling. But there was that continuous nagging ache in her mind, as the depression and gloom of the local ponies wore away at her empathic sense.</p><p class="double">Okay. How did it go normally? Twilight said that the first time they were here, Sombra turned up after a few days, and if they were feeling combative then the Loopers tended to use that time for setup.</p><p class="double">“Excuse me,” Rich tried to strike up a conversation with a nearby crystal pony. “Do you know if there&#039;s someone we can get information from?”</p><p class="double">The pony looked back at him with dull eyes.</p><p class="double">“Where did you come from?”</p><p class="double">No response.</p><p class="double">“We should try a library or something, Dad,” Diamond suggested.</p><p class="double">“Good idea.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right...” Rich said, frowning at the volume of local economic history he was reading. “So this <i>is</i> the Crystal Empire. I heard of it once, but I&#039;m pretty sure it was a bedtime story...”</p><p class="double">Tiara frowned, trying to glean more from the scraps of information she knew about the loop. There was something about a... festival? Granted, normally when she visited the Empire it was either visiting Cadence and Shining or going to the Games, but...</p><p class="double"><i>...a blue crystal</p><p class="double">shaped like the heart...</p><p class="double"></i>An image drifted through her mind, and she squinted for a moment as the psi-backlash hit.</p><p class="double">Being a P-4 wasn&#039;t exactly making it easy to concentrate.</p><p class="double">But if the ponies around here were all amnesiac, then maybe it would help them to have something to jog their memories.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you sure you can do this, crystal?” Rich asked, still a little confused.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Tiara replied, as they heaved the big lump of gemstone onto a hard surface. “My cutie mark&#039;s a diamond tiara, remember? Diamonds have to be cut. Maybe that&#039;s what it means – being a high-class jeweller.”</p><p class="double">(That had actually happened once. Though she&#039;d spent about half the loop being robbed by assorted comically bad robbers, and the other half talking with the various superhero-themed versions of her fellow Loopers to get the gems <i>back.</i>)</p><p class="double">“I think it means you&#039;re precious,” Rich said, smiling down at her.</p><p class="double">“Thanks, Dad,” she replied, smiling back. Then she turned to the big gemstone, and thought hard.</p><p class="double">Scratching her ear, she slipped Cubic Zirconium out of her &#039;pocket. <i>“Points of weakness?”</i> she subvocalized.</p><p class="double">Zirconium might have been a &#039;mere&#039; Intelligent Device, not a pony-in-a-computer like the Founders had become, but the Device was still very good in certain specialized areas – most of them relating to combat or analysis. A holographic map of points appeared in front of her vision.</p><p class="double">Two of them flashed, and Diamond nodded. Not all that far off where she&#039;d have picked herself...</p><p class="double">She turned her back. Winding up, she delivered an almighty buck to the first point, and cracks spread throughout the crystal. The second one, and it shattered into dust – apart from a lump about half her size, shaped like a heart.</p><p class="double">Rich gaped.</p><p class="double">“Ta-da,” Tiara said, grinning.</p><p class="double">After a moment more, her father bent down and hugged her.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t really think you could do it,” he whispered. “I think all parents hate thinking about their children growing up.”</p><p class="double">“No, don&#039;t,” she protested, blushing.</p><p class="double">“<i>You</i> did that, Diamond,” he replied. “And I can&#039;t ignore it. Well done.”</p><p class="double">Diamond leant into the embrace, smiling.</p><p class="double">After about another ten seconds, they broke apart. Diamond was still blushing, but beneath that her battle-hardened mind was analyzing the sensations coming through her telepathy.</p><p class="double">From a series of depressed nothings with the occasional faint memory, they were becoming stronger and clearer – near her, at least. Probably the operative phrase was more like “near the crystal”.</p><p class="double">“The Crystal Heart?” one crystal pony whispered, looking at the blue creation. After a moment, she blinked and looked away, as though she shouldn&#039;t have looked.</p><p class="double">Another walked slowly up to look at it, and another stab of half-remembered joy rushed through Tiara&#039;s head.</p><p class="double">Then everything else was swept away under a black tide of defeat and despair.</p><p class="double">“Diamond!” Rich cried, as she crumpled to the grass. “Are you okay?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, buck,” she managed, struggling to think. “He&#039;s early.”</p><p class="double">The happiness that had been starting to return collapsed, and Tiara felt adrift for a moment in a sea of foreign emotion before her training returned.</p><p class="double"><i>You are yourself. Anchor your shield on yourself. You are immovable. You are diamond-hard.</p><p class="double">I will not break.</p><p class="double"></i>Clarity returned, and with a strong pulse of effort she stabilized the mental shield.</p><p class="double">All the local ponies had fallen to the ground, she saw as she opened her eyes. Her father was still standing, not being sensitized to the magic, but she could see in his eyes that he was starting to feel it as well.</p><p class="double">Hooves clopped quietly on the cobbles.</p><p class="double"><b>“Crystal,”</b> King Sombra stated, approaching. <b>“Give up. Crystal.”</p><p class="double"></b>Diamond stood up.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">Black magic roared, this time directed straight at her. It had no physical presence, but slammed into her shield like a hammer.</p><p class="double"><b>“Crystal MINE! All MINE!”</p><p class="double"></b>“Get away from my daughter!” Rich shouted, charging towards the ancient unicorn.</p><p class="double">Sombra&#039;s eyes flicked to Filthy, and the blaze of dark magic doubled. One prong kept battering Diamond&#039;s failing shields, the other lashed towards Filthy Rich.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">The second spike of black magic splintered on another shield.</p><p class="double">Diamond felt a splitting headache come on, as she maintained a second mental wall – this one covering her father.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not a king,” she managed to say. “Rulers have to be worthy.”</p><p class="double"><b>“All my slaves!” </b>Sombra ranted, his magic growing still stronger.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">This time, it wasn&#039;t Diamond speaking.</p><p class="double">The first crystal pony to have noticed their ersatz crystal heart shook her head, focusing with difficulty on Sombra. “Not yours.”</p><p class="double"><b>“I rule here! All crystals MINE!”</p><p class="double"></b>On the last word, his magic gained a physical push. Diamond went flying backwards to hit the gem, the impact wooshing all the breath out of her lungs and leaving her fighting to breathe.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re not yours,” another crystal pony said. This time, the tone of voice was firmer.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not our king.”</p><p class="double">More and more blasts of dark magic coursed out from Sombra&#039;s horn, stabbing towards each speaker as they raised their voice.</p><p class="double">Diamond was still managing to shield all the targets, though her head felt like it was on fire, her back ached and she was starting to feel not all there.</p><p class="double">And she was still hearing thoughts. More and more of them, as the crystal ponies rejected Sombra one by one.</p><p class="double"><i>We don&#039;t have to listen to you...</p><p class="double"></i>“...and we don&#039;t want you here!”</p><p class="double">There was a rush of warmth, and then everything went black.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">Diamond&#039;s eyes wavered open.</p><p class="double">Twilight, Spike and her father were all standing above her. The scrunched up sheets both below and on top of her made her realize she was in a bed.</p><p class="double">“Thank Celestia you&#039;re okay!” Rich said, blinking back tears. “I was so worried.”</p><p class="double">“We all were,” Twilight said. “I have to say, I didn&#039;t see this coming...”</p><p class="double">“What happened?” Diamond asked, then shook her head. “I know about Sombra showing up, and the ponies saying they didn&#039;t want him, but I passed out.”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused, looking towards Filthy Rich. “Sorry, Rich, I think I might need to explain some things best kept secret. Feel free to ask her afterwards, but I&#039;m afraid that legally I can&#039;t explain with you in the room.”</p><p class="double">Rich looked unhappy, but reluctantly left.</p><p class="double">“Okay, spill,” Tiara said once her father was out of the door.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Twilight started, smiling mysteriously. “First of all, the rejection of Sombra by the Crystal Ponies seems to have banished him from the Empire entirely. I&#039;ll handle that more permanently later,” she added, reassuring Diamond that it would be taken care of.</p><p class="double">“What else?”</p><p class="double">“Right. That heart you made?” Twilight levitated up a bag, and opened it. A fine, sand-like dust of blue crystal grains hissed out.</p><p class="double">“This is about as much as was left,” she said. “Sorry. It couldn&#039;t handle the strain of being forced to do what the <i>real</i> crystal heart was designed for.”</p><p class="double">“Also,” Spike added, “you&#039;ve gone up about five P-rankings in one go from the overstrain. I&#039;m keeping you blocked now, but you may need some quick help to get your shields back to normal or you&#039;re going to hear every thought in eight furlongs.”</p><p class="double">“And, finally...” Twilight held up a mirror.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara stared at the alicorn filly lying in the bed.</p><p class="double">“...oh.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So she knew all about you?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“Pretty much,” Tiara said. “I asked her and Spike to keep it secret, because I really didn&#039;t want you guys jealous of me. Stupid, really...”</p><p class="double">“Wait.” Nyx pointed a hoof at her. “Does this mean you basically stole Cadence&#039; job?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Tiara shook her head. “Nope, nope, nope. It took me weeks to get away from the Empire because of all the hero worship. Cadence is welcome to it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">43.4</p><p class="double">“...so, yeah,” Applebloom finished. “I disabled a magical superweapon that was built to kill civilizations and harvested science from it.”</p><p class="double">There was general agreement that this was neat.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what now?” Nyx asked, finishing off the last of an orange.</p><p class="double">“Dunno, really...” Scootaloo admitted. “I mean, the whole cutie mark thing is kind of moot at this point.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a neat word,” Sweetie said. “Moot. It has a nice sound.”</p><p class="double">“Moot,” Diamond tried.</p><p class="double">“Moot.”</p><p class="double">“It totally doesn&#039;t sound like a word anymore,” Nyx pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, true. Okay, where were we?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Applebloom trailed off. “We&#039;re princesses now, right? What are we princesses <i>of?</i>”</p><p class="double">There was a long pause.</p><p class="double">“I think I&#039;m the Princess of the Night,” Nyx hazarded. “Possibly.”</p><p class="double">“We could just be too young for it, you know,” Diamond Tiara pointed out.</p><p class="double">The other three exchanged glances.</p><p class="double"><b>“CUTIE MARK-”</p><p class="double"></b>The apple cores, orange peels, cupcake wrappers, filly alicorns and nut shells went flying in the roar of gale-like sound.</p><p class="double">“Ow...” Nyx muttered from her position on top of a tapestry hanger.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rubbed her ears as she picked herself up. “Heh... Royal Canterlot Voice. Forgot about that...”</p><p class="double">Nyx spread her wings and floated down as the others righted themselves.</p><p class="double">“Right, no more CMC team shouts until we learn how to turn that off!” Applebloom said fervently, picking bits of nut shell out of her mane.</p><p class="double">“Sounds good. Er, or not...”</p><p class="double">“So, without the shout, what we were going to say was: Cutie Mark Crusader princess job finders,” Applebloom continued.</p><p class="double">“That works.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With some trepidation, Twilight opened the door to the room where her... daughters... had been spending the day.</p><p class="double">“Hi, girls,” she said, looking around. “Everything okay?”</p><p class="double">“Hello!” the five fillies chorused.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we were mostly swapping origin stories,” Applebloom said, subtly indicating her wings and horn.</p><p class="double">Twilight absorbed the message. “Okay, then.” She stepped further into the room, and closed the door.</p><p class="double">A guard made a noise of protest.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hush,” she said back at the closed door. “I don&#039;t think they&#039;re exactly likely to try to assassinate me, captain.”</p><p class="double">She turned back to the fillies, firing off a privacy spell. “So you&#039;re <i>all</i> alicorns? I knew about Scootaloo and Diamond, but not Sweetie or Applebloom.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, well...” Sweetie kicked the floor. “I kinda ascended in a loop where the anchor was not-you. Arda.”</p><p class="double">“Arda has an Anchor now?” Twilight asked, interested. “Last time I was there, we didn&#039;t see any.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s Gandalf,” Sweetie said by way of explanation. “And I kinda redeemed Melkor.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;s about how Olórin reacted afterwards,” Sweetie said, holding up her hooves to frame the image. “All &#039;well, I&#039;m too experienced to show it but I&#039;m also completely flabbergasted&#039;.”</p><p class="double">The others giggled.</p><p class="double">“I only Ascended that loop with Gilda as the Element of Honesty, and I was too embarrassed to tell you,” Applebloom said, looking down. “Sorry.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay, no harm done.” Twilight shrugged. “Right. Well, since you&#039;re all new to alicornification-”</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Nyx said, huffing.</p><p class="double">“...or at least most of you are,” Twilight corrected. “Nyx, you might need to help me help the others with what being an alicorn means. And I&#039;ve still got the job of running the country, so I might not have as much time to help you as I&#039;d like.”</p><p class="double">“No problem, momma. I&#039;ll show them what&#039;s what,” Nyx said with a salute. Then cracked up.</p><p class="double">“Hey, which one of us is going to be in charge of leisure activities?” Scootaloo asked. “I mean, that&#039;s a princess-type job, right?”</p><p class="double">“Dibs!” Sweetie said.</p><p class="double">“No way!” Scootaloo whirled to face her. “I challenge you to prank war over the title of Princess of Entertainment!”</p><p class="double">“I support Sweetie&#039;s bid,” Diamond announced.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;ve clearly got my hooves full this Loop,” Twilight said with a sigh. “Try not to wreck <i>too</i> many rooms. Oh, and there&#039;s a banquet an hour after sun-down, so make sure you&#039;re cleaned up and wearing your regalia.”</p><p class="double">“We have regalia?” the fillies chorused.</p><p class="double">“Check the Loop memories, it&#039;ll be there somewhere.” Twilight turned to the door. “Sorry, I really have to go. I&#039;ll try and make sure there&#039;s more free time on later days.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">All things considered, the banquet could have been a lot worse.</p><p class="double">The food fight had been almost expected, which was why the first course had been mostly foods served more for their suitability as throwing weapons than as royal fare, and the nobles walking out in disgust were mostly the snooty ones anyway.</p><p class="double">Or, at least, that was Twilight&#039;s story and she was sticking to it.</p><p class="double">The tree sap had been a bit much, though. And she&#039;d been looking forward to the cake, so seeing it spread over the wall (and part of the ceiling) when Applebloom tried to get herself a slice with telekinesis hadn&#039;t helped either.</p><p class="double"><i>This would be so much easier if I could hand half of it off to Cadence...</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='46'></a><h3>Loops 44</h3>
<br /><p>44.1</p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight said, her royal accoutrements in a pile against the wall. “I&#039;m fairly sure the way this loop would go in absence of our being Loopers would involve severe paperwork trouble on my part, the five of you feeling neglected, and complete chaos as you tried to act out. Possibly ending in Lunar time-outs.”</p><p class="double">“...hate to admit it, but that sounds about right,” Scootaloo said with a wince.</p><p class="double">“So. To solve this, I&#039;ve basically created half a dozen body doubles, and I&#039;m going to use them for paperwork. Understand this, girls.” She looked each of them in the eye, one by one. “However it came about, we&#039;re family for now. I might not necessarily be any <i>good</i> at it, and I know I can&#039;t replace your parents – in Nyx&#039;s case because I always am her parent,” she added with pedantic correctness. “But I&#039;ll do the best I can. Let me know if there&#039;s <i>anything</i> I&#039;m doing wrong.”</p><p class="double">The five fillies nodded, solemnly.</p><p class="double">Twilight returned the nod. “Thank you.”</p><p class="double">Then she formed an illusion in mid air. “Now, the first thing I think you need to <i>learn</i> – while you&#039;re all here to learn it – is Star Swirl&#039;s last spell. It&#039;s technically tricky, but you should get the hang of it eventually – and it makes it possible to go back from alicorn to any breed you want, so you won&#039;t accidentally get stuck in alicorn mode for a loop.”</p><p class="double">“Does this mean that new princesses aren&#039;t immune to homework?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“It does indeed.” Twilight paused. “Well, in all honesty you probably know most of what you&#039;d be taught, so I think I can limit it to politics, magic and so on.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s something, at least...” Diamond Tiara sighed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo fidgeted in her regalia.</p><p class="double">She still wasn&#039;t used to it. Heavy bronze shoes, a presence chain (something Twilight had told them she&#039;d adopted from one of her brothers&#039; ideas, since it meant you didn&#039;t have to wear both a peytral and a coronet) and, for the occasion, a bronzed saddle.</p><p class="double">Still, at least bronze wasn&#039;t quite as silly a metal for jewelery as the solid steel Applebloom was wearing...</p><p class="double">“The firstborn child of the Gryphon Emperor, lady Gerta Cottomenes!” an usher announced. (She thought he was called Hard Voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;which certainly fit.) He then walked into the room, and turned. “The daughters of Queen Twilight Sparkle, the Princesses of Equestria. Applebloom, Diamond Tiara, Nyx, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle.”</p><p class="double">The young gryphon who walked through the door after him seemed about as overwhelmed as they were, which was nice at least.</p><p class="double">“Uh... hi,” she said, then winced. “Sorry. Greetings from the Heir-elect of the Gryphon-”</p><p class="double">“Nah, the first one was better,” Nyx said with a wink. “Don&#039;t worry, we don&#039;t care much about formality.”</p><p class="double">The usher looked quietly scandalized.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Er, okay...” Gerta frowned, thinking, then gasped. “Oh! Sorry, I forgot, I have to present a gift to the Heir Apparent of Equestria. It&#039;s a goodwill thing, I think...”</p><p class="double">She tailed off, as the five alicorn fillies exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Girls?” Sweetie said. “Huddle.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, who the buck is the heir?” Scootaloo whispered. “Did we ever work it out?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Nyx replied, looking sour. “I don&#039;t know what kind of succession law we have here yet, so that&#039;s no help.”</p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t we assume it&#039;s the firstborn?” Diamond Tiara asked.</p><p class="double">“Tiara, if y&#039;all remember <i>that</i> far back ah&#039;m astonished.” Applebloom shrugged. “Far as ah can tell, Twilight just treated us all equal. Even before we all Awoke. Ah&#039;ve got no idea who was born first.”</p><p class="double">“Hang on a sec.” Nyx stuck her head out towards the gryphon fledgeling, who was looking a little lost. “We might be a while, feel free to grab some juice or something.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said, sitting in the centre of a semicircle of filly alicorns. “Star Swirl&#039;s final spell is one of his most impressive – and, for the majority of loopers, one of the most useful. The basic idea is related to relative amounts of earth pony, pegasus and unicorn magic.”</p><p class="double">“I think I know what you mean,” Applebloom hazarded. “After the loop reset which turned me back from an alicorn to an earth pony filly, Cookie could still detect a bit of pegasus magic and a bit of unicorn magic.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right,” Twilight nodded. “Technically, once you&#039;ve ascended and become an alicorn – or, for Nyx, Celestia and Luna, once you&#039;re born one – your soul is permanently that of an alicorn in a few subtle ways. You always have a tiny fragment of all three. What Star Swirl&#039;s spell does, when used right, is to change the relative amounts. It can&#039;t create magic from nowhere – and trying leads to... interesting results...” Twilight remembered the time she&#039;d accidentally scrambled her friends&#039; talents, and winced. “But since you all have a little of the appropriate magic already, you can just play around with the amounts to turn yourself from alicorn to a different pony type and back.”</p><p class="double">“So...” Scootaloo raised a hoof. “I can&#039;t normally cast magic...”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I&#039;m afraid that the step of going to a different breed of pony will always involve reascending to alicorn, and then undoing the spell again, so bear that in mind. I think your Devices all have the capacity for stealth spells, though?”</p><p class="double">Nods.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Nyx, would you care to demonstrate?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Nyx concentrated, flared her horn, and her wings disappeared. “Ta-da!”</p><p class="double">“Now reascend, please.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn paused, then reached into her mane. The odd clattering sound could be heard.</p><p class="double">“Nyx?” Twilight asked, concerned.</p><p class="double">“I haven&#039;t needed my pendant in, what, centuries! I forgot where it is, okay?”</p><p class="double">There was a crash.</p><p class="double">“Never mind...” Nyx withdrew her hoof, a gibbous-moon pendant in cosmic spectrum stone dangling from it. “Okay, here we go.”</p><p class="double">The room got momentarily darker, and Nyx was back to being an alicorn.</p><p class="double">“...okay, what just happened?” Applebloom asked. “That didn&#039;t seem, well, possible.”</p><p class="double">“My magic&#039;s kinda like that,” Nyx admitted. “Sometimes it makes unlight.”</p><p class="double">“Hay, before we forget,” Scootaloo asked, as Twilight started chalking magical formulae on the board. “What are we princesses of?”</p><p class="double">“Nothing yet,” Twilight answered absently. “I&#039;m the ruler right now, and you&#039;re all considered too young and inexperienced.”</p><p class="double">“That sucks,” Sweetie said with a pout.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find our destinies eventually,” Diamond Tiara replied, then paused and put her head in her forehooves. “And now I sound like <i>you</i> lot...”</p><p class="double">Applebloom stuck her tongue out.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, I&#039;m going to <i>love</i> hearing the reason behind this one...” Twilight said, raising an eyebrow and keeping her hooves from sticking to the floor.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Applebloom started, shuffling her feet. Or trying to. They made <i>schlup</i> sounds when she moved them. “I thought that Princess o&#039; technology would be a good specialization, so I decided to try inventin&#039; fast food.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t see how that&#039;s technology...”</p><p class="double">“Well, the technology came in with the potato cannon, and the squash racket, and the maple syrup flamethrower.” Applebloom hovered over a fried splinter of potato. “It actually tastes quite nice. Sweet.”</p><p class="double">Twilight plucked it out of the air, and nibbled on it. “I see. Well, I imagine it may be an acquired taste...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, true. You get enough tree sap as often as we do and you kinda develop a palate for it.” Applebloom shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Be that as it may, we do need to get the wall repaired. Hypersonic potatoes aren&#039;t very good for the stonework, and I think you may have freaked out a couple of peckish gryphon guards.”</p><p class="double">Something exploded a short distance away.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked in the direction of the noise. “Any idea what that was?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom drew a circle in the puddles of syrup. “You know as well as I do that that was probably one of my sisters.”</p><p class="double">With a sigh, Twilight nodded. “You&#039;re right, of course. Out of interest, how does Cheerilee cope with you lot?”</p><p class="double">“Normally we don&#039;t have crazy new magic powers to explore?” Applebloom volunteered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.2</p><p class="double">“...well, that&#039;s that adage proven true,” Twilight concluded as she closed a medical dictionary. “Modern magic really does have a cure for everything <i>except</i> the common cold.”</p><p class="double">Spike sniffled.</p><p class="double">“Or perhaps we should call it the <i>un</i>common cold, because this clearly isn&#039;t a normal rhinovirus,” she continued. “Maybe Fluttershy could help?”</p><p class="double">“I dunno,” Spike said thickly, rubbing his nose. “Worth a try-”</p><p class="double">He inhaled massively.</p><p class="double">Twilight, suddenly having a moment of premonition, dove for cover.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“WA-CHOO!”</p><p class="double">Ponies in the market turned to look at where the loud sneeze had come from.</p><p class="double">They saw a large dragon tail poking out of the library wall, a large dragon leg sticking out one window, and a large head having smashed through the top floor of the building.</p><p class="double">Roseluck cleared her throat, coughed, and then screamed.</p><p class="double">That started the Standard Ponyville Stampede Mark IV.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, dis idn&#039;t gonna be fun,” Spike muttered, dabbing at his streaming eyes as he shrunk back to normal size. “I tink my age-shifting&#039;s on de fritz.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d noticed,” Twilight commented, standing up again from behind the counter. “Perhaps it would be better if we went to see Fluttershy now, because I don&#039;t think the building can take another sudden dragon expansion.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good to me...” Spike felt another sneeze coming on, and clamped his claws on his nose to hold it in.</p><p class="double">Twilight translated his look of desperation to mean “hurry up”, and fired off the teleport.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With a loud crunch-crash-tinkle, half a tree landed on Celestia&#039;s dresser.</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Day looked up from her Daring Do book. “Oh, dear. Spike had better have a good explanation for that.”</p><p class="double">She turned the page. “Ah, Azihuotl again. She does have something of a perennial problem with him...”</p><p class="double">The broken crockery could wait until she&#039;d finished the book. It was quite engrossing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...well, on the plus side, at least you missed Fluttershy&#039;s house?” Twilight tried.</p><p class="double">Spike put his enormous head in his equally large hands.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait!&quot; A reporter ran up, cameraman following, who locked his aim on Twilight. &quot;This is Joseph James, reporting live from King&#039;s Metal Reclamation in Robley, where police are in a tense stand-off with an alien... pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, I&#039;m pretty relaxed,&quot; Twilight responded, &quot;and it&#039;s more of a stand around.&quot;</p><p class="double">She manifested a plush cushion and sat down. &quot;Any-pony else want one? Okay, now it&#039;s a sit down. Actually, you talk to the Inspector over there, if I&#039;m going to be on camera, I&#039;ll get changed.&quot;</p><p class="double">A cloth screen appeared between them and her, and you could hear her humming. After a few seconds, the reporter turned away and had the cameraman focus on the police officer. &quot;Sir, who are you and what&#039;s been happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">That worthy was actually feeling pretty grateful towards the purple pony, as her distraction had given him time to think so he wouldn&#039;t come out looking like a complete idiot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Inspector Burns, Merseyside Constabulary. We were sent here in response to a call by a worker here that an invader had appeared and was about to attack. He&#039;d included smart-phone video, so we took the report seriously. We were sent here to rescue any survivors and contain the alien threat.&quot;</p><p class="double">The screen vanished, and Twilight stood there, now clad in her business-mare outfit. &quot;I&#039;m not a threat, though I&#039;m told I do get tetchy first thing in the morning before breakfast. My assistant Spike says it&#039;s because I pull all nighters and don&#039;t snack. However, they arrived and handled the situation with diligence, dispatch, dedication, and... a lot of other good things, at least one of which should begin with &#039;D&#039;... sorry, that kind of got away from me, carry on.&quot; </p><p class="double">The fact that the pony was now available to talk to made Joseph switch his attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;So who and what are you, if not an invader? There have been reports of a crea... individual matching your description appearing in Japan and Brazil. Was that you, and if so, what is your purpose here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right now? Delivering that load of scrap spacecraft parts I collected from orbit for recycling. In general, helping out. I was in Japan and Brazil, and now I&#039;m here in the United Kingdom and likely to stay here for a while, if I&#039;m allowed. In general, I want to help out. This planet has had a rough time even without the invaders, and I hope by generating wealth and then using it and my powers to aid people, I can both alleviate that and at the same time demonstrate my good will. As to who and what I am, I&#039;ve got a prepared statement here...&quot;</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and her business briefcase style saddlebags twitched as she pulled out some note cards. A pair of wire rimmed glasses appeared on her muzzle, and she consulted her notes. </p><p class="double">&quot;My name is Twilight Sparkle, and I come from the land of Equestria on the planet Equus. It is a land of sentient ponies like myself, and home to many other races. And I was originally a unicorn. There are two other main races of pony, earth ponies with strength and earth related powers, and pegasi with flight and cloud control.&quot;</p><p class="double">A projected image appeared above her horn showing a street scene from Ponyville, and then Canterlot. Both were from a first person point of view, with Spike waling out in front of her and pointing excitedly at a bakery.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am not affiliated with those monsters you call invaders, and did not even know of their existence until after my arrival here; which was ultimately an accident, though something they indirectly caused.&quot;</p><p class="double">The scene changed to her study at the palace, littered with astronomical charts, books, blackboards with arithmantic notations and other paraphernalia. Princess Celestia was in front of her, looking at a star chart.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am a magical researcher and scholar, the protégé of Princess Celestia, co-ruler of Equestria, and an alicorn, one of the rare ponies who combines the traits of all three races, and trust me, the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts. I act as something of a trouble shooter for her. I&#039;m also well regarded as an astronomer, with multiple papers on both subjects to my credit. The ponies working on the Search for Extra-Equestrial Intelligence project had detected strong super-luminal energy surges from this part of the sky, and I was part of the team trying to discover their origin. I now believe it was an alien mother ship exploding.</p><p class="double">&quot;I developed a new generation of scrying spell using teleportation techniques that had interstellar range and could return images in real time, something of a breakthrough. Unfortunately when I tested it, it malfunctioned, due to the presence of a recently evaporated quantum singularity in the system. It overpowered the focussing array and caused an inversion. Rather than bringing the image to me, I was transported to the source of the image.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thankfully, I was in visual range of Earth when I emerged, and the residual atmosphere that had been carried with me could be contained by a forcefield, so I could survive long enough to get my bearings and teleport to the surface. However, it wasn&#039;t exactly my best landing. I was in shock and the sudden demand on my powers had made me semi-comatose, I had to have been radiating thaumic energy like mad.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her projection started to play a view of what had happened from her point of view.</p><p class="double">&quot;When I started to recover my senses, I got it back under control, but by then a group of military types had showed up, complete with a psychic, who immediately tried to mind control me. I chucked her out of my mind and pushed her away. I tried to communicate, tell them I didn&#039;t want to hurt anybody, just wanted help, but when I tried to cast a translation spell, they decided I was attacking and tried to blast me. </p><p class="double">&quot;I cast a sleep spell at the first one to do so, but then they all started, and while I was trying to block them, one must have used stealth technology to sneak up on me and use an electric stunner to knock me out. When I woke up, I was in a big glass chamber, with some sort of suppressive field making it hard to think. The invaders apparently use psychic powers too, and the scientists had some sort of suppressor. </p><p class="double">&quot;While the magic I use is different, it is related, and they were interfering with my powers. I resisted, they started trying to crush me to see how much power I could put out, and I refused to be crushed. No-pony really knows how the apotheosis works, but rarely, a regular pony at the very limits of their will and ability to survive can metamorphose into an alicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">She flexed her wings. &quot;As a unicorn I was in the top bracket of magic users in both power and versatility, both by talent and dedicated training and research. Alicorns are many times as powerful, and as a newly ascended one, my powers are still growing. The princesses Celestia and Luna are functionally immortal and can control the orbits of celestial bodies, and I&#039;m fairly sure by the time I get back I&#039;ll be able to pinch hit for them if they need a holiday.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyhow, I escaped, copied some memories from their chief scientist, something I&#039;m not proud of, but I desperately needed information about this place and she would presumably be the smartest one there. I found out among other things that she was ultimately going to do the same to me, though unlike my harmless spell, her methods involved driving metal probes into my brain and copying the electrical signals. The subject doesn&#039;t live long, and not with anything resembling a mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">She wrinkled her muzzle. </p><p class="double">&quot;Obviously, I got out of there, and had to decide what to do next. I&#039;ve already managed to send a message scroll back to Equus bare-horned, and will probably be able to follow it in a few days, though I may need to build a focussing array to get precision targeting. But I also found out what kind of stuff you guys had been through, and I wanted to help. But rather than just wandering around, randomly zapping things better, I decided to do it the hard way.</p><p class="double">&quot;The business I&#039;ve set up, Nightlight Industries gives me a legal identity, since as a non-human I&#039;m not covered by regular civil law, and I intend to use my powers within a framework of business to generate money for charitable purposes, and give a structured way to ask for my help directly. Which reminds me, half of the profit from this first sale of orbital salvage will be going to charity through the Nightlight Foundation. The rest will be invested in some other projects I thought up, which should ultimately create even more money for aid work.</p><p class="double">&quot;As well as that, I also have dozens of slightly used satellites and upper stages that could probably be reconditioned with a repair spell or some shop work. Their original owners get first refusal on my selling them at 100,000 pounds a pop, and as my advert stated, free delivery anywhere inside geostationary orbit. If the original owners don&#039;t want them, I&#039;ll put them up for general sale, I&#039;m sure I can get better than scrap metal values from a collector who wants their own satellite.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I also asked Princess Celestia not to send anyone after me, as I know you people are still leery of aliens. And that&#039;s the other reason I&#039;m doing this, to make it clear, not by fancy words but by deeds that my people are not like those monsters you&#039;ve been fighting. And that&#039;s all I have to say. Thank you for your time. In the manner of friendly aliens from your fictional works, live long and...&quot;</p><p class="double">She held up a hoof and then looked at it, frowning. &quot;Huh, didn&#039;t think that one through...&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a laugh from most of the people there. She gave them a grin and teleported away.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t until some time after that Joseph James found the business card for Nightlight Industries in his pocket with a written note about calling to set up a proper interview.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked into the bar with a haggard expression, giving Macintosh a brief nod as she slumped onto a stool.

THE GREAT AND POWERFUL!&quot; the floating illusory unicorn head boomed at a volume rivaling the Royal Canterlot Voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yah know,&quot; deadpanned Applebloom, &quot;I don&#039;t know why any a&#039; us expected somepony different...&quot;</p><p class="double">It was a weird sort of fused Loop. To their knowledge, no current looper was from this Oz place, much like there was no looper from the Eiken universe, not to mention the fact that it usually wasn&#039;t populated with Equestrian races. Nyx had Awoken after her house crash-landed from being whisked away from some farm place called Kansas by a tornado. After a song and dance number from a town of bushwoolie things regarding the death of some &#039;wicked witch of the east&#039; she&#039;d collected Peewee – idly wondering if the phoenix was looping and how anyone would be able to tell if he was – as well as some ruby ponyshoes and set off down the yellow brick road to go see the Wizard.</p><p class="double">On the way she&#039;d come across the Awake versions of the CMC. Applebloom was some sort of pony-like scarecrow strung to a wood post, Sweetie was a tin mare who had rusted up in the woods, and Scootaloo was a griffin of all things. Nyx mused that the Loops had a strange sense of humour. The Loop memories of her three companions implied that her friends were seeking things they already possessed in spades. But they&#039;d all still agreed to come with Nyx to see the Wizard because, why not?</p><p class="double">&quot;I still say that gate guard sounded familiar,&quot; Sweetie cut in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you still on about that?&quot; Scootaloo groaned. &quot;Just because he&#039;s got a bit of a Trottingham accent doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s anyone we&#039;ve met before. You don&#039;t need to inspect everyone we come across to see if they&#039;re the Anchor you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOU DARE IGNORE TRIXIE, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL?!&quot; the floating head boomed again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nyx called back. &quot;How&#039;s the Loop treating you auntie?&quot;</p><p class="double">The head gave a big sigh before it dissipated along with the fog it was projected on. A curtain off to the side of the room was swept back and Trixie strode out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not bad,&quot; she replied reluctantly. &quot;But you four <i>could</i> show some respect for Trixie&#039;s showmare skills.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Applebloom apologized, &quot;but I noticed the projector lens when we came in and pointed it out to the others. It&#039;s still pretty dang impressive. Even if it&#039;s not quite what we&#039;d expect from you these days.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie&#039;s been rediscovering her roots this Loop,&quot; the showmare admitted. &quot;After a near disaster with an experiment, Trixie has been cutting back on the brute force she&#039;s come to rely on over the Loops and begin re-honing her skills at the stagecraft that once served her so well. In fact, Trixie has not used so much as a cantrip this Loop. And she has still convinced Oz and the threats to it that Trixie is a wizard of great skill and power. All through smoke and mirrors.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s pretty awesome!&quot; Scootaloo beamed. &quot;So, do you have a super-amazing quest for us to undertake?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed Trixie does,&quot; the showmare admitted. &quot;The Wicked Witch of the West is still at large and she is more powerful than her sister ever was. The task is to retrieve her ring, which possesses a gem through which she is able to focus her foul magics. Without it, she will be rendered powerless and of no more threat to Oz.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And after that?&quot; Nyx asked. &quot;I mean, it&#039;s not like any of us need the things we&#039;re supposed to want. Applebloom&#039;s got more brains than any of us, Sweetie&#039;s heart is as caring as ever, Scootaloo&#039;s still a daredevil, and I&#039;ve never technically <i>been</i> to the Kansas place I&#039;m supposed to be from this Loop so I&#039;ve got no real incentive to return. So I think we&#039;d probably just stick around for any more adventures you&#039;ve got on tap.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Trixie mused. &quot;There&#039;s the Nome King, Mombi, the Wicked Witch of the South is due to wake up from her enchanted sleep any time now, Princess Langwidere is out there somewhere collecting heads, Tyrone the Terrible is due to make a move soon, and there&#039;s probably a few others that escape Trixie&#039;s mind at the moment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is gonna be an awesome Loop!&quot; Scootaloo cheered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Picard the winkie dog, and normally one of the three Trek Anchors, stretched back in his guardpost. This was shaping up to be another nice vacation for him. His only interaction with other loopers had gone as usual, with them completely unsuspecting of his looping status.

Oh, what class did you go with?”</p><p class="double">“Duskblade.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight frowned. “Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve heard of that one... it wasn&#039;t in that book Pinkie had, anyway.”</p><p class="double">Gilda settled into the chair. “So, what&#039;s this place like, anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Adventure with swords and sorcery, pretty much.” Twilight shrugged. “All six of us &#039;classic&#039; Element bearers had one a long while ago – that&#039;s where Fluttershy got started on her druid thing, though it took a while for her to really get used to using it again once the loop was over.”</p><p class="double">The gryphon nodded. “And any idea who else is here, then?”</p><p class="double">“Not really...” Twilight&#039;s eyes unfocused. “I picked up an Element of Honesty, of course, but that turned out to be yours... oh. Well, that should be interesting...”</p><p class="double">“What?”</p><p class="double">The door slammed open. “Tremble before the power of the Great and Powerful Trixie, Wilder extraordinaire!”</p><p class="double">A cough came from behind the blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">“And Chryssy, of course,” Trixie added, stepping aside to reveal the Changeling. “She&#039;s a psion.”</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. “Hi, guys.

Beer?”</p><p class="double">There were general nods.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, anyway, according to our backstories we met when she tried to use Charm on me and I tried to use a wild burst energy ray on her,” Trixie said with a grin. “Long story short, huge psionic glitch, both of us lost our powers for three days, actually got to know one another.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, sipping at her tankard. (Inns in Oerth always had quite good beer. It was the Profession system.)</p><p class="double">“So, are we heading out or what?” Gilda asked, idly casting Bloom on Trixie&#039;s beer and creating a miniature lily pad.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s other party members on the way, but last time there were six,” Twilight hedged. “I&#039;d say set off tomorrow morning.”</p><p class="double">The door creaked open again.</p><p class="double">“Or we could just have them turn up now,” Chrysalis observed, then winced. “Oh. Well, this could be awkward...”</p><p class="double">“Hi, Shiny, Cadence,” Twilight said, smiling. “How are you?”</p><p class="double">“Tolerable,” Shining replied, shaking water out of his mane. “It&#039;s raining out there, has been for two hours.”</p><p class="double">Cadence spread her wings and fluffed them out. “I miss weather schedules.”</p><p class="double">“So, er...” Chrysalis began, in a voice of forced calm.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry,” Cadence said, furling her wings again and looking Chrysalis in the eye. “Tell you what.

Any idea what the Quest is?”</p><p class="double">A gnome walked up to Twilight, handed her a gilt envelope, and headed off for the back room.</p><p class="double">“Oh, thank you.” Twilight opened the envelope. “See, that&#039;s one nice thing about this world, it&#039;s so convenient for adventuring... aha!”</p><p class="double">She held up the letter within.</p><p class="double"><i>Dare YOU enter the OFFICIAL World&#039;s Largest Dungeon?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Every monster you&#039;ve ever heard of!

However, last loop had been a doozie and she could use a nice, relaxing vacation loop for once.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, Nyx was awake as well and didn&#039;t mind returning to Ponyville. She wanted to see all her friends and her family as well. Within moments, the two ponies and the cart disappeared from the road.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wow!&quot;</p><p class="double">That was all Twilight could say as she stepped into Big Mac&#039;s bar alongside Nyx. The place was packed with countless friends all talking up a storm. Berry just finished setting down a pair of &#039;honeymoon&#039; cocktails between Shining Armor and Cadance before returning to Mayor Mare, the newest equestrian looper. The crusaders sat at the Mayor&#039;s hooves as she gave the tale of latest fused loop in the DC Universe. Dash, Pinkie, Rarity, and Fluttershy were at their own table exchanging stories of their own. Applejack was nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sat with Luna and Celestia, clearly uncomfortable as she fidgeted while proposing ideas about a tea shop. The princesses, or at least Celestia, seemed delighted at the idea, which meant Chrysalis would be seeing more of her. Twilight knew it would be good for the nervous changeling, to get her out of her shell. Nyx scurried across the floor to the Crusaders as Twilight announced her arrival, &quot;Morning everypony!&quot;</p><p class="double">The bar responded with a resounding, &quot;Twilight!&quot; with the exception of Discord who shouted &quot;Norm!&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac slid a pint of cider to the edge of the redwood counter where Twilight usually came to a rest and asked, &quot;How&#039;s the loops treatin&#039; ya, Twiligh&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cantered over next to Mayor Mare, &quot;Vampires and Nazis Big Mac, enough said. Where&#039;s Applejack?&quot;</p><p class="double">The owner replied, &quot;Back a&#039; the farm preparin&#039; more cider. Everyone&#039;s awake this time. Dash got a letter from Gilda this mornin&#039;. Tiara&#039;s workin&#039; on a project back at &#039;er home. Trixie&#039;s busy with other duties, so she&#039;ll be in later. We even had a couple loopers from the multiverse in earlier.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to Big Mac and looked at the Mayor as she continued her tale. She slurped up the cider in one gulp and set it down as the Mayor got to the finale, &quot;And so after Apokolips invades and half of Metropolis is leveled, Superman punches Darkside through the other half! Literally, there wasn&#039;t a building left standing afterwords.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor looked to Twilight, &quot;How do you get used to such ruffians like the humans? They build such magnificent structures only for super powered monsters to tear them down like foals playing in the sand box.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a small grin, &quot;I found not all of them are so bad. Superman perfers to solve his problems without violence...it&#039;s just the others are not so willing. You sound like you could use a vacation, visit some family and old friends even if they&#039;re not awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor sighed, &quot;That does sound nice. But I have duties to Ponyville here-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight waved a hoof in a dismissing gesture, &quot;I could handle your Mayoral duties. I&#039;ve ran a country or two before after all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually,&quot; the mayor began, appearing not sure for a moment, &quot;I&#039;m not the Mayor this time around, I&#039;m the Librarian. Trixie is the mayor. I assume you&#039;ve replaced Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">The idea that Trixie replaced the Mayor sent a shiver of dread down her spine. Already, she could feel her quiet vacation loop disappearing like smoke in the wind. She listed and categorized several of the strongest alcohols out there before deciding on one and calling out for some of Jack Sparrow&#039;s rum stock he left behind before leaving Equestria, not even bothering to answer the former Mayor&#039;s question as her panic set in.</p><p class="double">But instead of a bottle of rum, a sparkling highball glass was set before her along with some gin. She looked up to see a human form Berry Punch standing in front of her giving her a smile that radiated calm, &quot;I&#039;d like you to try a human cocktail I was taught when I started perfecting my trade. If it doesn&#039;t fix your problems, I&#039;ll get that rum for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked the human Berry over for a moment, then remembered, &quot;You surprised me there, Berry. Forgot you can shift from pony to human form.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry&#039;s grin turned melancholy, &quot;The loop where I learned shape shifting was the same loop where I got my act together. It was a very strange loop, where no one was sent to the moon, you were replaced with Sunset Shimmer as the Summer Sun Celebration Co-ordinator, and a new bar named Eden Hall opened up where your treehouse library is.&quot;</p><p class="double">All activity in the bar ceased as the loopers turned to listen to Berry. The bartender didn&#039;t even notice as everypony was now listening, so lost in her thoughts and preparing the cocktail. She took a glass bottle labeled Angostura Aromatic Bitters and added it to the edge of the glass with four shakes.</p><p class="double">&quot;I believe the owner was your anchor replacement. He&#039;s actually quite the urban myth among loopers. Some call him the &#039;Phantom Looper&#039; since he tends to draw so little attention to himself that most loopers don&#039;t tend to realize he&#039;s looping. His local name was Shot Glass with the image of a golden cocktail being poured into a deep martini glass as his cutie mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry chuckled as she added the ice and a double measure of premium gin, &quot;I decided to sample its fine wares before its grand opening. As always, I broke into the building and made my way to the cellar. But when I got to the wine racks, there was nothing there. I searched for the better part of an hour in vain. I checked everything that could hold a bottle containing anything alcoholic. That was when Shot Glass found me.&quot;</p><p class="double">The cocktail was topped off with some tonic and the mixture was stirred slowly four times as it turned a pink hue, &quot;He found me trying to break into the only locked cabinet in the building, which only held some local equestrian seasonings. I saw him in human form and almost had a heart attack right there. That loop had a quirk where ponies could shift into human form, part of what terrified me so deeply. The other half was he could have called in the royal guard and had me exiled from town. Instead, the looper shifted into an earth pony with a black mane and tan coat. His eyes were full of kindness and a small amount of pity. An hour later, I&#039;m sitting at the bar as a human after being taught how to shift into human form with this cocktail resting on the countertop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bartender slid the stirring spoon out and added a lime wedge before shifting back to pony form and sliding the drink forward towards Twilight, &quot;Here you are, Twilight, the Pink Gin and Tonic, adding some herbs that I found mix well with this drink.&quot;</p><p class="double">The anchor took a sip of the drink and found the stress and pain from the last loop bleeding away with every drop that slid down her throat, &quot;Berry...this is amazing!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry rubbed at her snout in embarrassment at the praise. Twilight looked at the bartender, expecting Berry to finish her story. She caught on and continued, &quot;He started on about what type of Gin he used and the different citrus fruits one could add. But then he gave a small history about how the tonic had been used to treat Malaria in countries so far away they couldn&#039;t be found on the map. The word tonic means &#039;invigorating, refreshing.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry closed her eyes as if remembering an old friend, &quot;He served me countless cocktails from places that existed in legend with bottles that appeared from seemingly thin air. After all that, and when I couldn&#039;t pay him for all the drinks he gave me, I was offered a job as an assistant bartender. He took me under his wing and taught me how to pour and mix my own drinks. Turned out, I was good at the job, picking up the trade over the course of that loop. He learned that we were both loopers and introduced me to the multiverse. Bit by bit, he helped me clean up my life.&quot;</p><p class="double">After Twilight finished her Gin and Tonic, Berry cleaned out the glass, &quot;I hope to meet him again, show him how much I&#039;ve improved both as a mare and a bartender. So, Twilight, do you feel better? Do you still need that rum?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a pleasant smile, &quot;Actually no, I think I&#039;m good. I was hoping for a quiet loop, but an anchor&#039;s work is never done I guess. Mayor Mare, enjoy your vacation. You got yourself a replacement librarian.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a moment of peace as Pinkie bought a round for the whole place in celebration. But then like glass shattering, the peace was destroyed with the doors being flung wide open as Trixie flourished her purple cape, &quot;Rejoice, my fellow loopers, for it is I, the Great and Powerful Mayor Trixie, who has come to improve your lives!&quot;</p><p class="double">She went amongst all the loopers, handing them scrolls and coming to an end with Twilight and Mayor Mare. Already fearing the worst, she opened the scroll and frowned.</p><p class="double"><b>NOW ANNOUNCING THE FIRST ANNUAL EQUESTRIAN FOAM SWORD WAR!</b></p><p class="double"><b>The office of Mayor Trixie welcomes all who consider themselves loopers to Ponyville to participate in momentous occasion. Loopers will engage in combat with only a foam sword. Whoever is struck by a foam sword will be eliminated. The victor will receive the assistance of Princess Celestia and Twilight Sparkle in any of their personal projects. </b></p><p class="double"><b>Rules of Combat: </b></p><p class="double"><b>- No killing. </b></p><p><b>- Any attacks must be in the form of a foam sword. However, the sword based attack could be administered in any form. If you can fire a foam sword from a gun, it is valid. </b></p><p><b>- A competitor will be eliminated if he or she is struck by a sword on an exposed body part. </b></p><p class="double">Celestia and Luna looked the scroll over, then shouted their full support for the mountain of hilarity that was about to ensue. The former Mayor whispered in Twilight&#039;s ear in a begging tone, &quot;Please make sure some of Ponyville is standing when I get back.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight muttered under her breath, &quot;Tree damn it!&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">44.13</p><p class="double">Twilight trotted into Celestia&#039;s room.</p><p class="double">“Your Highness?”</p><p class="double">Celestia turned. “Ah, Twilight. I&#039;m sorry to have dismissed your concerns about Nightmare Moon in what may have seemed a cavalier manner-”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no, that&#039;s fine,” Twilight shrugged. “You want me to gather the Elements of Harmony, together with suitable bearers, so you have a backup plan if you can&#039;t talk Luna round when she gets back from the moon.”</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Sun blinked. “...yes, actually. How did you know?”</p><p class="double">Twilight sat down. “Time travel.”</p><p class="double">“You used a spell from the Star Swirl wing?”</p><p class="double">“No, not that time travel. A time loop – self contained temporal cyclicity, duration a little over five years.” Twilight grinned, summoned the Element of Magic, and Ascended in a flash of purple light.</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">“This isn&#039;t the first time. It isn&#039;t even the thousandth. I&#039;ve been going around in temporal circles for a <i>long</i> time. And I&#039;m not always the only one, either.”</p><p class="double">Twilight ruffled her wings. “Anyway. There&#039;s a reason I&#039;m telling you this. See, a couple of the other loopers want to partake of a certain ceremony, and to avoid anyone being left out of the first one they&#039;ve asked for it to be done when none but them and I are Awake. So... it might help to get you on side, to straighten a few issues out.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m still absorbing that you&#039;re an alicorn, Twilight,” Celestia said, strain in her voice. “Give me a minute or two.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight replied readily.</p><p class="double">Celestia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and then made some tea. She heated the water the slow way, with a simmering heat spell, rather than simply flash-boiling it, and then poured two cups.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” she said, placing the cups on either side of a low table. “Let&#039;s start from the beginning. You are... time looping, you said?”</p><p class="double">“I did, and am.” Twilight took the proffered cup and sipped from it. “Ah, lovely. You <i>do</i> know how to brew a good cup... anyway. The first thing we need to do is to set up a party in Ponyville. I&#039;ve done it before, so I know how to set it up to handle Luna nice and amicably.”</p><p class="double">Celestia swallowed, shook her head, and took solace in some more tea.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, I&#039;m overwhelming you, aren&#039;t I?” Twilight shook her head. “I should really get better at breaking it to you when you&#039;re not Awake. Anyway, Spike and Rarity are both also looping this time, and they&#039;d like to tie the knot.”</p><p class="double">“...who is Rarity?” Celestia asked. “And – isn&#039;t Spike rather too young to be married?”</p><p class="double">“Time loops,” Twilight reminded her. “His mental age is on the far side of lots, and we worked out a way he can change his physical age at will. Rarity is a unicorn from Ponyville – the Element of Generosity.”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded.</p><p class="double">“The first time around, he got quite a bad crush on her. She might have reciprocated to some extent, she&#039;s not quite sure, but nothing happened within five years of today and so we never found out. When they met up in the Loops, both of them were quite a lot older and more experienced. They took over a hundred years – that&#039;s twenty iterations of the loop – to decide to become a proper couple, and they&#039;ve been significant others since then. It tallies up to...” Twilight paused. “Lots.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Celestia carefully considered the situation, and what Twilight had told her. “And they are happy together?”</p><p class="double">“Very.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, then.” Celestia nodded. “I&#039;m sure it will make sense once I meet her – and this new, older Spike. I assume you want me to attend the wedding?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “Spot on – though I&#039;d also appreciate your help handling the legal quagmire involved.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm, indeed...” As the shock faded, the Princess of the Sun began to apply her formidable mind to the problem. “Very well, I think it should be eminently achievable.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Princess.” Twilight turned to go.</p><p class="double">“Oh, Twilight?” Celestia said, warning in her tone. “Are you sure you want to go out into the corridor like that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked back, caught sight of her wings, and blushed before undoing the transformation.</p><p class="double">“That, more than anything, helps convince me of the truth of your words,” Celestia commented. “That you are so clearly comfortable in an alicorn&#039;s form.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn grinned. “Yeah, a lot of us have been able to do that for a while...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“She seems fine with it,” Twilight replied. “Right, who next?”</p><p class="double">Spike drummed his claws on the table. “Either your family – because I&#039;m sort of part of it – or Rarity&#039;s. Might be better to have Rarity for both those meetings.”</p><p class="double">Twilight lit her horn. “No time like the present. And I can drop off those party instructions with Pinkie on the way.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Rarity has become more dear to me than... anything else I possess,” Spike said solemnly.</p><p class="double">Magnum frowned. “Anything <i>else?</i>”</p><p class="double">“I am hers, as she is mine.” Spike shrugged, blushing a bit. “I... it&#039;s hard to explain, and it&#039;s kind of related to dragon psychology. We hoard things. Other dragons hoard gold, or gems, or artworks... I still have some of that, but the main thing I treat as a hoard is my friends. To me, Rarity is mine, and I would protect her to my last breath. And, at the same time, I am hers, and anything she desired, I would do.”</p><p class="double">“Does that include leaving?” Rarity&#039;s mother asked with a frown.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Spike said with a quick nod. “If she told me to go away and never come back... and if she <i>meant </i>it, and continued to mean it... I&#039;d stay out of her life. It would probably destroy me, but I would.”</p><p class="double">Pearl nodded slowly.</p><p class="double">“Can we speak to our daughter?” Magnum requested.</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Spike turned to go. “I&#039;ll let her know, and give you some privacy. Just ask when you want me back in.”</p><p class="double">“<i>If</i>, you mean,” Magnum said sternly.</p><p class="double">Spike nodded, and pushed the door open.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Does he make me happy?” Rarity repeated. “Yes. A thousand times yes.”</p><p class="double">She gave her parents a long, appraising look.</p><p class="double">“Let me put it this way. I know we mentioned the loops, and they&#039;re an easy concept to explain, but... they&#039;re nearly infinite in variety. I&#039;ve been worshipped as a goddess, I&#039;ve been a slave with not even my own cutie mark. I&#039;ve been the ruler of the world, I&#039;ve been a noble unicorn mare in my own right, I&#039;ve been a simple shop owner, I&#039;ve started my own business...” She shook her head. “It sometimes feels like I&#039;ve done everything, though the loops constantly show that I haven&#039;t. And if there&#039;s one constant I can truly rely on, it&#039;s that Spike cares for me.”</p><p class="double">“That kind of devotion...” Pearl winced. “It sounds... almost creepy.”</p><p class="double">“I do understand where you&#039;re coming from,” Rarity admitted. “It probably could look bad from that perspective. From the outside. But... well, we didn&#039;t exactly rush into it. It took us over a hundred years to go from friends to being an official couple, and that was... oh, so long ago. By now, he and I feel the same – neither of us started like this, but both of us developed it over time.”</p><p class="double">“And you trust him not to hurt you?”</p><p class="double">Rarity surprised all three of them by giggling. “Oh, sorry. But there&#039;s two things funny about that. The first is that, well, not to blow my own trumpet, but...”</p><p class="double">A soft white light flooded the room.</p><p class="double">“I can match him if I need to,” Rarity finished, extending her wings to their full span. “When we do spar – or have a spat – it&#039;s essentially a toss-up as to who wins. I&#039;m no damsel in distress, at least unless I want to be.”</p><p class="double">Magnum blinked a few times, then visibly got a grip on himself. “And second?”</p><p class="double">“Spike&#039;s a bearer of Loyalty,” Rarity replied matter-of-factly. “The short version is, that he bears Loyalty means that that trait, trustworthiness – dedication to his friends – is a fundamental part of his makeup.”</p><p class="double">Rarity fidgeted. “In all honesty, we don&#039;t need your blessing... after all, Spike and I are both adults by a long way. But it means a lot to me, and it would mean a lot to him. So – do we have your support?”</p><p class="double">Magnum and Pearl exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Is there anything which would make you leave Spike?” Pearl asked.</p><p class="double">“No,” Rarity replied. “Anything that would make me want to – he wouldn&#039;t be Spike any more. Not the one I love.”</p><p class="double">“Good answer,” Magnum commented.</p><p class="double">“Well, then... yes,” Pearl said softly. “We don&#039;t understand all of this, but what we do understand is all good.”</p><p class="double">Tears started in Rarity&#039;s eyes. “Thank you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Twilight asked, re-entering the main room of her parents&#039; house.</p><p class="double">Twilight Velvet nodded to her with a smile. “It&#039;s strange, because we still think of little Spykoran as, well, little, but if you and he agree that he&#039;s old enough... well, what else can we do?”</p><p class="double">Spike smiled.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that&#039;s good. I&#039;ll send you the invitations shortly. Is Shiny still living here?”</p><p class="double">“Well, he comes over often enough,” Night Light said. “A couple of times a week. He&#039;ll get them.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Actually, I want to come over and give him the invitations for Cadence and him myself now. Just to see his face when he realizes that I know.”</p><p class="double">Velvet put her hoof over her smile. “Oh, dear, that <i>would</i> be funny. He still thinks he&#039;s managing to hide it, you know – says it&#039;s &#039;work-related&#039; reasons he&#039;s seeing her so often.”</p><p class="double">“So you know, actually,” Twilight said, reaching into her &#039;pocket and retrieving an album. “Here&#039;s some of their wedding pictures.”</p><p class="double">She paged through them, first the ones from their normal-loop weddings (both to plan and post-Changeling-battle) and then the increasingly exotic ones which were from especially noteworthy set-pieces for Loopers.</p><p class="double">“Are they always together?” Night Light asked, as his wife examined one of the photographs more closely.</p><p class="double">“Just about,” Twilight replied. “It doesn&#039;t happen every time, admittedly, there&#039;s been a few edge cases, but-”</p><p class="double">“Statistically insignificant,” her father filled in.</p><p class="double">“Yes.” She paused. “Cadence is one of the ponies I <i>really</i> trust, after so long in the loops. Don&#039;t worry, Shiny&#039;s in safe hooves.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t believe they all knew,” Shining Armour said ruefully.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s hardly the end of the world,” Cadence chided, smiling to remove the sting. “Besides, I think Twilight and Spike have an unfair advantage.”</p><p class="double">“Point,” Shining conceded. “Do you think-”</p><p class="double">Cadence overrode him. “Ssh! This is the good bit!”</p><p class="double">Words drifted over to them. “...in Eiken or in Hub...”</p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t know what that means,” Shining said, frowning. “I overheard Spike writing them, but...”</p><p class="double">“I assume it&#039;s part of that whole Loops thing, now shush!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike stared at the thin circlet of metal, still not quite believing it.</p><p class="double">Rarity tapped him on the shoulder. “Careful, or I&#039;ll start to get jealous of that ring.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you&#039;re what it symbolizes,” he replied, putting his arm around her. “I... it all seems like a dream, really.”</p><p class="double">Rarity glanced down at her dress. Like the rings, it was a simple one – her mothers&#039; dress, in fact.</p><p class="double">“I know what you mean,” she said, more quietly.</p><p class="double">They could both hear Sweetie Belle pestering Shining for a place in the Guard. Shining had tried to explain why she was a bit young, but Sweetie wasn&#039;t listening – and everypony else was finding it too funny to come to Shining&#039;s aid.</p><p class="double">“You are my wife,” Spike tried, the words feeling almost unreal.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re married,” Rarity ventured, finding the same thing happening.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Spike said, gamely, “at least we&#039;ll get a lot of time to practise saying them.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s very true.”</p><p class="double">They sat back, and watched Luna&#039;s moon rise through the trees.</p><p class="double">“...you realize,” Rarity said, in a much less serious voice, “that I am no country bumpkin to be won over by so paltry a display.” She winked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, indeed, my fair lady,” Spike countered, then dropped the act. “I&#039;ve been planning the <i>big</i> one for a while. Still not finished yet.”</p><p class="double">“I can wait,” Rarity promised. “As long as it takes.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.14 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There was a flare of pink fire as the boutique door slammed open. &quot;RARITY BELLE PLATINUM PRINCESS WHATEVER OTHER NAMES YOU&#039;VE HAD!&quot;</p><p class="double">The white unicorn looked up from the dress she was sewing and raised an eyebrow. &quot;You know, the full name ultimatum doesn&#039;t actually work in the loops, does it?

HAD A WEDDING! <b>WITHOUT ME!!!!!!!</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity took a moment to still her terrified heart.</p><p class="double">Then she took a breath and let it out. &quot;I take it you&#039;ve seen Twilight&#039;s film of the ceremony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes. It was very beautiful, quite sincere. I really wish I could have been there.&quot; Cadence blinked and shook her head, remembering her wrath. &quot;WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO MY ORIGINAL POINT--!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re still planning on doing the big wedding!&quot; the unicorn reassured her quickly. &quot;We just wanted everyone to be Awake first!&quot; She wasn&#039;t sure if that was true or not but she figured it would buy her time.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You had BETTER,&quot; Cadence growled, &quot;be sure about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Absolutely.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a tense moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;...are... you not going to yell at Spike?&quot; Rarity finally ventured.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, he lives with Twilight,&quot; the princess replied with a dangerous grin. &quot;I&#039;ve already expressed my displeasure with him.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

TRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Wait a minute,</i> Cookie said suddenly. <i>You all still remember Old Holly Hooves?</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle, and Apple Bloom shared a look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... well... he&#039;s kinda a story.&quot; The earth pony chuckled awkwardly. &quot;Fer little fillies and colts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A big jolly reindeer comes down the chimney and sticks gifts in stockings,&quot; Sweetie Belle explained. &quot;I personally thought it was an adorable old pony&#039;s tale, but–&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Old pony&#039;s tale?!</i> Pansy cried in shock. <i>That caribou was one of the bravest heroes of our generation!</i></p><p class="double">Clover sighed. <i>Pansy, dear, our own story was sanitized over the generations. As great as Holly was, the fact is Krampus could give nightmares to foals.</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo raised an eyebrow. &quot;Krampus? I don&#039;t think I know that name...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>And there you have it,</i> Smart Cookie said wearily. <i>Without the villain, Holly becomes nothing more then a nice gift giver...</i></p><p class="double">Apple Bloom smiled to herself. &quot;Maybe ya&#039;ll could set the record straight then. Who was Krampus, and how was Old Holly Hooves a hero?&quot;</p><p class="double">For a moment, the necklaces were silent.</p><p class="double"><i>You have to understand,</i> Clover began slowly, <i>the Fire of Friendship only worked in a localized area. Even while we were expanding Equestria, a lot of the land was still covered in ice and snow.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Still, there were a lot of opportunistic groups out there,</i> Smart Cookie continued. <i>They&#039;d set off, a union of the three tribes, and found settlements in hopes of repelling the Windigos. Sometimes it worked... sometimes it didn&#039;t.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Some of my own kin were part of one of those groups,</i> Pansy commented. <i>They bravely went back north, not to the old lands, but... well, they built themselves a little village. It was a fairly normal settlement, we&#039;d get reports back, but then one month... nothing.</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo patted her necklace gently. &quot;It must have been hard, not knowing what happened...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I assumed they&#039;d been buried in the snow.</i> Pansy sighed. <i>There was a country to run, and I couldn&#039;t afford to go looking for them....</i></p><p class="double"><i>Nopony blames you,</i> Smart Cookie offered gently. <i>We couldn&#039;t have known about him.</i></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle gulped. &quot;About... who, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Krampus the Black.</i> Without warning, Clover projected a holographic image of a horned, shaggy–furred biped, whip in hand and red eyes glaring. <i>A satyr sorcerer who enslaved the village. The manacles he wore granted him power so long as weariness and despair were abundant. But with the windigos retreating...</i> She trailed off.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;He needed to find a new source of suffering ta power his magic.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>And here was this village of ponies, right on his doorstep...</i> The necklace around Bloom&#039;s neck glowed angrily. <i>Krampus was a monster, in form and in heart. He would break the legs of ponies who defied him, and whip those he considered too slow in their so called work. Mare, stallion, foal.... pegasus, unicorn, earth pony.... he treated all with equal cruelty, making them labour in the snow whenever suited him. They took to sticking warm coals in their stockings just to fight off the cold.</i></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle stared at the image before her. &quot;...I take it this is where Old Holly Hooves comes in?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Indeed.</i> With a slight shift, the necklace around Belle&#039;s neck changed the image to a noble, elderly caribou with a thick white beard and piercing eyes. <i>The caribou clan has always had a connection with wind, being able to hear the whispers from miles away. Their elders have even managed flight, sometimes. And when Holly Hooves heard the cries of pain and anguish on the winds, he was so moved he had to act.</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo was now completely enraptured by the story. &quot;So... what did he do?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>He did what I would have done,</i> Pansy replied gravely. <i>He provided for those under his protection, by having his tribemates sequester gifts of food and clothing in secret to the village, and sought out a way to defeat Krampus, by tracking down the beings who made his manacles in the first place.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Mountain elves,</i> Clover elaborated. <i>Very rare, very isolated. Presumably there was some sort of war that nearly wiped them out... whatever the case, Holly found them, asked for their help. They forged him a chain of bells that would neutralize elvish magic, but only if it was fuelled by hope and joy. And in return he swore his clan to their protection.</i></p><p class="double">Smart Cookie glowed with pride <i>They say the battle lasted a full day. Even after the chains were fuelled by the hope of the village, Krampus and Holly duelled in a blistering snowstorm. I don&#039;t know how much of that was exaggerated, but in the end Old Holly Hooves won. There was a great celebration in the village, the ponies made robes for the elves, bread was broken with the caribou... a message was sent out to us, detailing the whole thing, but by the time we arrived they had all gone.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Wow.&quot; Apple Bloom breathed out. &quot;Ah... did not even realize...&quot; She looked at the painting of a smiling reindeer with new eyes. &quot;And that&#039;s tha last ya&#039;ll heard of them?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>...I did meet him much later,</i> Pansy admitted. <i>When I was very old. Travelling north, I saw a glacier in the shape of a caribou skull... and inside, a coven of elves making toys, with the old deer himself at their head. He explained that the bells which bound Krampus would need to be... well, refuelled soon, so he&#039;d come up with an idea to spread gifts to the little ones in a nearby village. I advised him to do so around Hearth&#039;s Warming Eve, so as to capitalize on the emotion... I suppose that&#039;s how the story was revitalized.</i></p><p class="double">After a moment, the necklace sighed. <i>I don&#039;t understand how the chimney thing came about, though.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.3 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight honestly wondered why variant Loops set in the Canterlot High School universe – that strange alternate version of Equestria where everypony she knew had a human counterpart – weren&#039;t more common. She&#039;d certainly prefer this place to that alternate Ponyville where &#039;Rainbow Dash always dresses in style&#039;.</p><p class="double">The good news for this Loop was that finally, finally, the other Elements were Awake for it. She could now actually explore this place with her friends rather than startlingly accurate facsimiles.</p><p class="double">The bad news started when the zombies showed up.</p><p class="double">Not just normal zombies, but the ones with ridiculous variations like wearing road cones and buckets on their heads, pole vaulters, bob–sleighers, and other types she&#039;d have rather never seen again.</p><p class="double">And the only viable long–term defense were those cartoony animate plants. She may have had access to world–shaking magic and weapons, but even her reserves weren&#039;t nearly as inexhaustible as the zombies seemed to be.</p><p class="double">It was another fused Loop with <i>that</i> universe. And no forewarning to check her sanity at the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what&#039;s the deal with Crazy Dave anyway? Is he the Anchor from wherever these things are normally from?&quot; Rainbow asked her after a particularly brutal wave. Thankfully, no brains had been eaten yet. At least not those of anypony&#039;s counterpart she knew. The attacks let up often enough that basic necessities like food and utilities could be gathered before hunkering back down and waiting for the next attack. She and her friends had taken to sleeping in shifts so that there was always at least two of them awake in case &#039;extreme gardening&#039; skills were needed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe,&quot; Twilight responded tiredly. &quot;No one can really tell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Think we could ask Sleipnir to check the next time we see him?&quot; Rainbow suggested.</p><p class="double">&quot;Already did that,&quot; Twilight told her friend. &quot;Apparently he is the designated Anchor for his universe, but his &#039;code&#039; is so incomprehensible that even the Yggdrasil admins can&#039;t tell if he&#039;s actually looping or if his universe stabilized on its own. And they don&#039;t want to try triggering others from his universe to start looping until they figure it out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot; Rainbow scrunched her face in confusion. &quot;How can the beings that run reality not understand him enough to tell if he&#039;s looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave Rainbow Dash a flat stare. &quot;Because he&#039;s crazy.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the dank gloom of the Everfree forest, a predator moved on silent feet.</p><p class="double">Moving lightly over the leaf litter, the predator&#039;s eyes flickered all around. Her nostrils scented the air, trying to gain the slimmest edge.</p><p class="double">There!</p><p class="double">The predator bounded forwards, pushing off with all her might and soaring over a brook towards her goal.</p><p class="double">There were several seconds of snarling, growling tussle, and then predator and target separated. Both were bleeding, but the cuts were superficial, and they darted off into the undergrowth once more.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How long are they going to take?” Spike asked, hovering on a thermal. “It&#039;s been five hours!”</p><p class="double">“No idea.” Twilight trimmed her wings to catch the same thermal, and then soared up and around her assistant. “Suppose they&#039;ll just have to work it out for themselves.”</p><p class="double">She rolled onto her back, grinning. “Ah, I&#039;m not a pegasus nearly enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A heavy paw slammed Gilda&#039;s beak into the ground, making her see stars. Snapping out her wings, she forced the other off her and lashed backwards with her hind–paws hoping to catch her target with them.</p><p class="double">No such luck.</p><p class="double">The only warning she got, as she righted herself and made to turn, was a moment&#039;s rustling leaves. Then a weight landed on her back, forcing her back to the forest floor.</p><p class="double">White teeth flashed near her throat for a second, and she went limp.</p><p class="double">“Okay, okay,” she said after a moment. “You win. Seventeen to fourteen.”</p><p class="double">The wolf closed her jaws, and carefully backed off Gilda&#039;s side. Then it blurred, and Fluttershy stood there.</p><p class="double">“Thank you for your understanding.”</p><p class="double">“Understanding, hash!” Gilda pawed at her beak to get some of the mud off. “Pwah. Anyway, take it from one predator to another – I get the whole dominance issues thing. It&#039;s better we get it out of the way now.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, her cheeks slightly coloured.</p><p class="double">“...I&#039;ll win next time, though.”</p><p class="double">The pale yellow pegasus gave Gilda a look which was surprisingly arch.</p><p class="double">“...maybe. Okay, we&#039;ve had the fight, what now?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Fluttershy shuffled her paws. “I did get hold of some rather nice hadrosaur meat last loop there was a chance...”</p><p class="double">“Dinosaur meat?” Gilda&#039;s eyes lit up. “I am <i>so</i> there!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There we go,” Twilight said, nodding with satisfaction. “That&#039;s that.”</p><p class="double">“I heard something about dinosaur meat...” Spike trailed off. “Any chance I could get some with gemstones roasted in?”</p><p class="double">“I think you&#039;ll have to ask Fluttershy.” Twilight waggled her wings. “I&#039;m not willing to speak for her.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” He made a ponderous turn towards Ponyville, with Twilight accelerating to ride his slipstream. “...any chance you could get me something from the next time you encounter a silicon based creature?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll think about it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.5 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Shining woke to the gentle rocking of the ocean.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m in a boat, and it&#039;s night...” Specifically, a small ship with one mast, that seemed to have seen more than its fair share of years. </p><p class="double">“And I&#039;m wearing a mask, and have a rapier by my side.” Then his loop memories set in. </p><p class="double">“Cadence&#039;s in danger!” Looking ahead, he could see another small ship ahead of him, in the distance, and yes, searching his memories, they were heading to the &#039;Cliffs of Insanity&#039;.</p><p class="double">“Who names these places?” he snorted with disdain.</p><p class="double">He considered jumping from the boat and swimming the remaining distance, but loop memories kicked in again.</p><p class="double">“Right, eels.”</p><p class="double">The dawn was ascending and the ship up ahead had docked at the cliffs. Arriving, himself, all he found was a length of rope that went straight up the cliff. Looking at his hooves, and looking at the rope...</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve got to be kidding me.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken a few moments, but he&#039;d heard about gravity shifting spells from his sister and this was as good a time as any to try them out. </p><p class="double">It was now the reason he was galloping up the cliff&#039;s face, where ironically, upon reaching the top, he now stood face to face with that very same sister.</p><p class="double">“Hey BBBFF!”</p><p class="double">“Twily?” he asked, shocked.</p><p class="double">“Well, here it&#039;s Twilingo Montoya, dashing and revenge driven swordsmare.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, wait. Are we in &#039;the Princess Bride&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“Ahuh. You&#039;re the Stallion in Black, the Dread Pirate Blackmask.”</p><p class="double">“I knew this somehow seemed familiar. The Cliffs of Insanity should&#039;ve given it away.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway, there&#039;s Big Mac and Spike ahead of us as Mazzik and Spikini. Cadence&#039;s awake, but those two aren&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">“Great! I&#039;ll see you later...” moving to leave, he was pulled back by a purple, tekekinetic tug.</p><p class="double">Twilight nervously hooved the ground. “Shiny, I was kinda wondering if we could duel.”</p><p class="double">“What? Now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes grew big. “Please?!”</p><p class="double">Shining sighed. “Fine.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A thrown rock smashed close to him. He&#039;d been running in pursuit of Cadence and the remaining two, finally ending in a rocky gorge.</p><p class="double">“Enope.”</p><p class="double">Big Mac, or Mazzik as he was known here, trotted out from behind a rock. It was sight he&#039;d remember for a very long time as you don&#039;t often see Mac dressed in a turban and vest.</p><p class="double">Doing his best to stifle any laughter, he replied. “Now what?”</p><p class="double">“You put down your sword and magic, I put down my rock, we settle this like civilized folks. Hoof to hoof. Sportspony–like.”</p><p class="double">“Ah hah. Sportspony–like.” Shining chuckled nervously.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Mac went down with a large thud, unconscious.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, about that. Oh right. What was the line? &#039;Dream about large mares?&#039;&#039;</p><p class="double">Shining grabbed his sword in his telekinesis and raced after Spikini and Cadence.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Shining was seated across from Spikini and a blindfolded Cadence out in an open field. Two glasses of wine sat on a stump in front of him.</p><p class="double">&#039;Awake or not, I don&#039;t actually want to kill Spike.&#039; thought Shining.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twenty minutes earlier.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shiny, Thanks for the duel,&quot; said a lightly panting Twilight. &quot;One more thing. Awake or not. Please don&#039;t kill Spike.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;d you have in mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! I know!&quot; Twilight reached into her subspace pocket, and pulled out a vial. </p><p class="double">&quot;This is a sleeping dust. Its odorless, but works when you inhale it, so don&#039;t do that. You should be able to figure out the rest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, Twily!&quot; Shining cried as he dashed off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Back to the present. </p><p class="double">Shining reached into saddlebags and removed the vial Twilight gave him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Inhale this but do not touch.&quot; cautioned Shining.</p><p class="double">&quot;I smell nothing.&quot; replied Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;What you do not smell is called iocane powder. Its odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is one of the more deadly poisons know to equines.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm..&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining than took the cups and placed them behind him for a few moments and before bringing them back and placing them on the stump.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. Its ends when you decide and we both drink and find out who is right, and who is dead.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spikini?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spikini?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spikini responded by falling over, asleep.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Wasn&#039;t sure it&#039;d work that fast.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Snnxxz...&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining removed Cadence&#039; blindfold.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. Iocane doesn&#039;t work like that.&quot; questioned Cadence.</p><p class="double">&quot;Swapped the iocane for some sleeping dust. Started working when I asked him to inhale it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence replied with a flat &quot;Huh.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Snnzxzz&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You said it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So how do you want to play the rest of it?</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we&#039;re definitely not playing it straight. I&#039;ve not terribly fond of being tortured and having fifty years of my life sucked away&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not to mention the whole &#039;Mostly dead&#039;, thing.&#039;&quot; Cadence added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, but I do have a plan.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A slightly worse for wear Shining and Cadence emerged from the exit of the Fire Swamp, and Prince Blueblood, Count Sombra and a half dozen guards were there waiting for him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Surrender!&quot; The Prince barked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.&quot; Shining snarked back.</p><p class="double">&quot;I give you full marks for bravery. Don&#039;t make yourself a fool.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, but how will you capture us, especially when we have this!&quot; A pink energy shield surrounded both Shining and Cadence, forming a ball.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh very good. But we can wait around.&quot; Sombra replied, amused.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m counting on that!&quot; said Shining as he and Cadence started running with the energy shield they were in rolling forward like some bizarre hamster ball.</p><p class="double">There were gasps of shock and surprise as everypony madly ducked out of the way as it went hurling through.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah! You missed!&quot; Blueblood&#039;s joy turned to sorrow as he saw the ball turn around and come racing back after him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh crud.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Somehow, in all the chaos, Twilight had shown up, and was busy stunning the guards and anypony else that was left standing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twily?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think I&#039;d miss this? I followed you all the way here. Oh and I needed to do one more thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">She walked over to Count Sombra and knelt over by his face. Curious, Shining and Cadence walked over as well.</p><p class="double">&quot;You made his face look like a Kabuki mask?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup. It&#039;s permanent too. Had to get my revenge somehow. &quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is a <i>sanctuary</i> loop. There&#039;s no violence, no hate...&quot; She glowered at the green unicorn across from her. &quot;We&#039;re here to help people recover from the stresses of their home loop. We are not here to play yes–men and coddle morons.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blond colt looked right back at her. &quot;What are you saying, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m saying that showing off is fine. You can wow the crowd with your magic, that&#039;s great. But lecturing them on your superiority? <i>Casting Imperio?</i>&quot; She leaned over the desk. &quot;The only reason you&#039;re not on the moon right now is because I&#039;ve BEEN to Hogwarts. I know exactly how your world runs. I knew what kind of environment you grew up in, and I know what is expected of you. Quite frankly, I pity you.&quot;</p><p class="double">A sneer formed on the green unicorn&#039;s face–</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot; Twilight cut him off. &quot;I took the Dark Lord on by myself and utterly destroyed him in my <i>first</i> fused loop. Nothing you can say will impress or terrify me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....Hrm.&quot; The sneer was gone, replaced by a carefully neutral expression. &quot;The star bear wasn&#039;t my fault.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Ura Minor is a standard whenever Trixie comes around,&quot; Twilight countered dismissively. &quot;We&#039;re not blaming you for that. But not even Trixie went into &#039;dark&#039; magic without being influenced by the Alicorn Amulet. You&#039;ve crossed a line.&quot; She smiled, a smile more suited to a carnivore. &quot;So.... you&#039;re going to have some <i>remedial</i> lessons. Every bearer is going to teach you how to embody their element.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn groaned. &quot;And here I finally thought I&#039;d be able to get out of school... I take it you&#039;ll be enforcing these lesson plans somehow?&quot;</p><p class="double">With a smile, Twilight handed him a series of parchments. &quot;Here. Letters from Pinkie when she replaced Hermione Granger.&quot;</p><p class="double">She would later privately admit that the reaction of the colt in front of her was one of the most hilarious things she had ever seen.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I.... see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It gets better,&quot; she quipped. &quot;She can become an alicorn at will.&quot;</p><p class="double">The green unicorn grew a little greener.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, recap: You&#039;re going to publicly apologize to Ponyville, me and my friends are going to give you lessons on the Elements of Harmony, and we&#039;ll see how this goes.&quot; Twilight Sparkle smiled brightly. &quot;Welcome to Equestria, Draco Malfoy.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.7 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and the triple somersault by that unicorn was absolutely incredible! I&#039;ll admit I was a little worried when the earth pony filly, Apple something, jumped from that pier but the way that the pegasus caught her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And those BATONS! I don&#039;t know how they enchanted them! Even if they got outside help, the amount of things that they turned into – and the flute solo was amazing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t even believe the, what did they call them, extreme gear? Extreme indeed! I&#039;ve never seen anything like it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That finale, though, that was absolutely astounding. Obviously they couldn&#039;t have really ascended, that would be impossible, but it seemed so real!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Harshwhinny? Didn&#039;t you say something about me needing to contain my enthusiasm?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.8 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...This is... awkward,&quot; Smart Cookie finally said, glancing down at the necklace around her neck.</p><p class="double"><i>Well... in retrospect, it was inevitable. Ah mean, we&#039;re soulbounded. Lotta loops where that&#039;s normal have a few switches.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, but...&quot; The filly rubbed the back of her head awkwardly. &quot;It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve had an actual body. And such a young one at that, I... honestly don&#039;t know what to do.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Enjoy being a foal! Go to school, look fer yer cutie mark, make friends with Pansy and Clover... Get covered in tree sap, Ah dunno. Go on, ya&#039;ll deserve it.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.9 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Doctor, it&#039;s been...<i>really interesting</i> travelling with you,&quot; Twilight Jane Smith said.</p><p class="double">This was her very first fused loop with this new universe, and it had been a challenge. There was time travel going on EVERYWHERE! A whole race of beings who worked the fabric of time and space the way pegasus ponies handled the weather! The fact that ponies and humans coexisted on Earth was the least strange thing, but at least Twilight could run comfortably. Travel with the Doctor seemed to require lots of running.</p><p class="double">The whole universe had a weird vibe to it, though. Twilight had decided to hold off on experimenting with anything until she had a better idea of what was going on, sticking to her loop–self&#039;s role. Even THAT had been confusing! But now, after many adventures and four (no, wait, seven? Maybe?) Doctors, the loop was about to end.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; the Doctor said, hands rubbing together, &quot;Now then, before you go popping off to that little pony universe of yours, there&#039;s one thing I <i>probably</i> should mention.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike opened his mouth to ask Twilight what the plan was for this loop, only to close it again as she walked in with a pronounced eye twitch.</p><p class="double">&quot;I – that – UGH!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bad loop?&quot; Spike asked instead.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes – no, not really, the loop wasn&#039;t that bad,&quot; Twilight admitted, &quot;But that Doctor! He figured out I was looping, and I thought HE was too. Only he ISN&#039;T, he just time travels so much that he was able to bluff it out. And he didn&#039;t bother saying anything about it until end of the loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">Grumbling, Twilight reached into her subspace pocket. At least she&#039;d managed to keep the sonic lipstick, she&#039;d finally be able to figure out the full range of that thing&#039;s abilities...except that the sonic lipstick was gone, having been replaced with a notice.</p><p class="double">&quot;The universe you are attempting to breach is locked as READ–ONLY. No items or persons may be copied, on pain of...&quot; Twilight skimmed past several dozen threats from Skuld. The general theme was, on pain of <i>pain.</i> &quot;...huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">Great. So much for all the useful things Twilight had planned to nab from the TARDIS next time she looped in there. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Ah, that fresh new world smell!</p><p class="double">Jenny took a deep breath as she flickered into existence, sighing and smiling. Grass, live grass. Cobblestones. Hay. <i>Magic,</i> infusing everything. Pastoral, then?</p><p class="double">Her eyes flickered open, looking around at the small village. The creatures that lived here were slightly–only slightly–shorter then humans, judging from the doors. There were pink highlights in every building, enough to be noticed, but not enough to be... <i>gaudy.</i> Many of the doors lacked knobs, or handles, and as one of the natives wandered into her vision, tossing her curly pink mane, she realized why. Ponies! Every little girl&#039;s dream, in all the colors of the rainbow!</p><p class="double">Her eyes widened as a winged pony landed next to the pink one and chatted for a moment. She hadn&#039;t meant the rainbow comment literally, but apparently...</p><p class="double">The pony pegasus (could it really be a pegasus if it wasn&#039;t a horse?) took off again, and Jenny followed its path with her eyes. Once more she was in awe as the pony handled the clouds in the sky. Weather manipulation was old hat to her, of course, but the way that this pony twisted and turned through the air made it clear that she was a natural at her given task. Quickly pulling a camera out of her satchel, Jenny started to film what she could of the aerial display–</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there!&quot;</p><p class="double">The woman whirled and looked into the widest smile she had seen in a long time. How had the pink pony managed to sneak up on her? After a moment, realizing that no attack was forthcoming, Jenny smiled and rolled her eyes. &quot;Hello here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Ha! Good one!&quot; The pink pony stuck out a hoof. &quot;I&#039;m Pinkimena Diane Pie, local party pony and friend to loopers everywhere! Don&#039;t worry, the Anchor&#039;s going to be here this afternoon, I&#039;ll introduce you. Welcome to Equestria!&quot;</p><p class="double">Jenny grinned and took the hoof in her hand. &quot;Jenny Everywhere, shifter and drifter. Your loop&#039;s pretty nice! You got humans here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not native.&quot; Pinkie tilted her head. &quot;Actually, most other loopers that come here turn into ponies. What&#039;s up with you?&quot;</p><p class="double">The woman sighed, looking off into the distance. &quot;I&#039;m... a bit of an anomaly. I don&#039;t actually have a home loop... as far as I can tell, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my gosh! That&#039;s... sad, but it sounds exciting!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heck yeah!&quot; Jenny smirked at the pony. &quot;I get to go everywhere! Krogan, elves, vampires, ninjas, ninja elf krogan vampires–that was one WEIRD loop–I ain&#039;t seen it all, and I never will, but that won&#039;t stop me from trying!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.11 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was running over her options at the moment. The expansions seemed to be proceeding apace and the prospect of new experiences – particularly finally learning what might be in that locked object the Tree of Harmony had produced – was quite invigorating to her. In addition, last Loop she&#039;d finally completed her little set of variants of the latest Daring Do novel, each one guest starring a different friend of hers (plus one guest starring her of course), and was looking forward to the next Loop they were all together so she could give them out.</p><p class="double">Right now though, she was wondering if there was any method she hadn&#039;t yet used to deal with Sombra. While the evil stallion usually had all the mental acuity of an unrepentant drug addict who snorted crystals – the Elements of Harmony apparently did a number on his mind most Loops – he was an extremely evil and scary pony the Loops where he was competent. As such, Twilight felt little remorse for humiliating him in new and creative ways every chance she could get. Frankly, he deserved it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm... maybe I can arrange an &#039;accidental&#039; meeting with Daring this Loop and get her on board with discovering an intact lost civilization, recovering a powerful magical artifact, and defeating a despotic conqueror all at the same time. Could make for an interesting book. I wonder if I still have that–&quot;</p><p class="double"><u><i><b>*CRACK*</b></i></u></p><p class="double">45.12 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;–harglepth...&quot; Twilight collapsed to the ground. She tried looking around her, but immediately closed closed her eyes when her vision swam rather severely. She <i>thought</i> she was back in her tower in Canterlot where she did research as Celestia&#039;s student prior to being sent to Ponyville, but that made no sense. She&#039;d been in the middle of a typical, if lonely, Loop and abruptly she was here. There was no reason she could tell for the Loop to have ended prematurely like that, but she felt like she&#039;d just Awoken. And in the roughest manner she&#039;d ever experienced.</p><p class="double">In all honesty, she felt sick enough to have consumed the entire contents of Big Mac&#039;s looping stock of alcohol as well as suffering the combined hangover that would induce at the same time. Frankly, if she hadn&#039;t garnered the mental fortitude looping inevitably provided, the pounding of her head would probably be lethal all by itself.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked the air around her. Or tried to. It came out more like &quot;whppnd&quot;. She thought she heard voices, but the pounding in her head drowned them out.</p><p class="double">Twilight wasn&#039;t certain how long it was before her head started to clear – the pain and disorientation rather made it hard to keep track of time – but clear it did. She opened her eyes to see the concerned faces of not only Celestia and Spike, but also the other five normal Elements, Gilda, Trixie, as well as Luna and her daughter Nyx to boot. And to top it all off, Sleipnir, the eight–legged Yggdrasil admin assigned to their universe.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow,&quot; she chuckled weakly. &quot;How hard did my collapse derail the timeline?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s okay!&quot; Pinkie cheered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my, Twilight,&quot; Rarity gushed, &quot;You gave us all quite the scare.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No kiddin&#039; sugarcube,&quot; Applejack breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Y&#039;all been out fer hours.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever happened to you reverberated through the Elements so hard that everyone bonded to one felt it like a physical blow,&quot; Rainbow told her, looking more worried than Twilight had ever seen her. &quot;Even Gilda felt something was wrong and she&#039;s the most recent addition to the club.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mine sister sent out the signal that she was awake and we responded promptly. Celly told us of your predicament and together we arranged for both ourself and Nyx to be brought down early to render any aid we could. We... are not certain precisely why the eight–legged Lokison has come.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I needed to be certain that Twilight was stable,&quot; the Yggdrasil admin said rather formally. &quot;She was hit rather hard with a destabilizing event and I needed to be on hand in case she required my aid recovering from this end. I am thankful that no intervention was required. You may rest easy, her regaining consciousness means any potential danger has passed.&quot;</p><p class="double">One by one, each of the visitors expressed their relief that Twilight was alright.</p><p class="double">&quot;I take it what ended the last Loop wasn&#039;t normal,&quot; Twilight offered from a couch Celestia had conjured for her to rest on.</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Sleipnir agreed, &quot;it most certainly was not. Nor was your Loop the only one ended so abruptly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How many a&#039; tha Loops were affected?&quot; Applejack asked, already knowing she wasn&#039;t going to like the answer.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir gazed at the gathered loopers very seriously before answering.</p><p class="double">&quot;All of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes nearly popped out of her skull. &quot;Wha– What could possibly do something like that?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir sighed and addressed the room. &quot;I will tell you all I am allowed to, but understand that the restrictions on certain sensitive information means that I am literally incapable of telling it to you. Please sit down, as this may take a while.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So...&quot; Rainbow prompted after everyone was seated.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened was that we lost another Loop,&quot; Sleipnir explained solemnly, &quot;except this time it was particularly catastrophic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean... a whole universe, just gone?&quot; Pinkie&#039;s hair deflated as she began to tear up. &quot;No more parties or loopers to have parties for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Sleipnir nodded, &quot;that is precisely what happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Twilight interrupted, &quot;you said you lost &#039;another&#039; Loop. When has this happened before?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir blinked in surprise and looked directly at Twilight in confusion. &quot;You don&#039;t remember?&quot; When Twilight shook her head, he gained a sour expression. &quot;I told her to fix that, and I&#039;m sure she knew how...&quot; he muttered as his markings began to glow. &quot;No wonder you didn&#039;t remember a Loop being lost before. Hold on a moment.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight did as he asked, and suddenly the memories of Madoka and her friend Homura from that Loop came rushing back. Why would Madoka have not fixed her memory about such an important event if she was able to do so?</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Twilight reoriented herself, &quot;so someone named Madoka, who&#039;s apparently memory–proof, ascended past the dimensional boundaries of her Loop. And then was reunited with the only other surviving looper in one of our Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sleipnir scowled angrily. &quot;She effectively accessed Yggdrasil without authorization or training in order to arrange a fused Loop here to recover her friend, potentially exposing your Loop to the harmful viruses and malware that are no longer properly contained with Yggdrasil damaged as it is. As sympathetic as I am to her plight, I cannot approve of her exposing your Loop to such risk. I was, as you might say, not happy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s... not dangerous, is she?&quot; Twilight asked. Her restored memories showed Madoka as friendly and very much concerned for the well–being of her friend. The idea that she was a bad individual just didn&#039;t compute.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not... inherently,&quot; Sleipnir sighed. &quot;Mostly she is misinformed about the nature of Yggdrasil&#039;s system and inexperienced in how things are done at our level. She is also potentially mentally imbalanced given her seemingly rapid acceptance of the loss of her Loop. There are a number of rumours going around about her, not the least of which are regarding what happened to her friend Homura after her recovery from your Loop, and I hope that some of the more sinister ones prove untrue. Of all the things we really do not need to deal with right now, an insane neophyte goddess is rather high on the list.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Can anything be done to help the poor darling?&quot; Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;The backups of her universe are undamaged,&quot; Sleipnir admitted. &quot;It may be possible to restore it after the Loops end, but with the rather rapid ascension of the only viable Anchor from that universe to the divine level – even if she was manipulated into doing so – restoring it at this time has been deemed to be counterproductive.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who manipulated her?&quot; Spike inquired.</p><p class="double">&quot;Her looping familiar, Kyuubey,&quot; Sleipnir informed the dragon. &quot;An extremely misguided and potentially sociopathic entity dedicated to preventing the collapse of his universe by filling young souls with grief and then persuading other young souls to assist in harvesting them until they too are filled with grief. We remain uncertain if he survived the Loop&#039;s destruction, and request that if you encounter him in the future that you detain him by any means necessary.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, he&#039;s totally not getting a Pinkie Party,&quot; the party pony in question growled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Regardless,&quot; Sleipnir continued, &quot;The collapse of Madoka&#039;s Loop was the best case scenario possible. The most recent event was perhaps the worst case scenario. Yggdrasil taken in the form of a tree would contain the Hub in its trunk with the various Prime universes, or baselines, branching out from it, and a myriad of variant universes further branching out from each of those primary branches. The Anchors keep the primary branches, and all that grow from them, stable. Hub Loops take place where the primary branches meet the trunk rather than the trunk itself, and many fused Loops take place where two or more of the smaller tertiary branches cross one another. The collapse of Madoka&#039;s Loop was like a primary branch cracking a few inches out from the trunk, while the recent collapse was more like the entire branch being ripped off the tree, taking a portion of the trunk with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ouch,&quot; Gilda voiced the general consensus of the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait a sec,&quot; Nyx interjected. &quot;If the Loops are set up with one Anchor per &#039;primary branch&#039;, then how do the Linked Loops work?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir raised an eyebrow at the change of topic, but decided to humour the filly. &quot;Damage to the various universes after the event that initially damaged Yggdrasil was not uniform. The Hub escaped damage due to being the most critical, and thus most protected, portion of Yggdrasil. And while a few other universes remained intact enough that they did not require anchoring like most, the only other universe to escape unscathed was Eiken.&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire room winced at the mention of the widely agreed most aggravating known Loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Some were damaged to the point that a single Anchor was not sufficient, and so they were divided into portions and each portion anchored through the baseline. The Trek Loops were the first successful Linked Loops brought online.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Twilight interrupted. &quot;There are loopers native to the Trek Loops?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Sleipnir nodded. &quot;I understand they like their privacy and rather than gain a wide variety of powers and skills like most loopers, they instead have honed their ability to remain undetected as fellow loopers. I&#039;d tell you who they are, but it would invalidate my wager that you&#039;ll be the first to get proof.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, why...&quot; Twilight facehooved suddenly. &quot;Right. Starfleet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; asked the confused god.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Trek loopers would have to deal with Starfleet, who get reports on everything they do,&quot; Twilight explained. &quot;They regularly deal with a lot of things they can&#039;t possibly have any foreknowledge of, and anyone in Starfleet with half a brain would pick up on them acting with too much foreknowledge and launch an investigation. Which would mean they&#039;d most likely have to explain the Loops every time this happened. That got old for me after a few times trying to convince Celestia that I was Looping before she Awoke. I pretty much gave up except for special occasions after I&#039;d done it a couple dozen times, and Celestia&#039;s the best case scenario.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not entirely sure if I should be flattered,&quot; Celestia joked.</p><p class="double">Twilight simply continued on. &quot;I know Harry Potter still hasn&#039;t forgiven Dumbledore for what he did the times Harry tried to convince him of the Loops early on, and Dumbledore is still relatively benevolent if lacking in common sense. A group of superiors, some of whom may be actively hostile? Yeah, I can see how they&#039;d want to keep their looping status hidden.&quot;</p><p class="double">While the rest of the room nodded in sympathy and understanding, Sleipnir decided to get back to the topic at hand.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, when the collapse affected the Hub, it damaged that universe&#039;s backups. We don&#039;t know what data, if any, survived.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How do backup files work in a system like Yggdrasil anyway?&quot; Twilight inquired. &quot;I mean, I doubt you actually have anything else that could store the kind of data Yggdrasil runs.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very true. Tell me Twilight,&quot; Sleipnir said in the manner of a teacher, &quot;how do <i>you</i> think backup data works in a system like Yggdrasil? I can tell you that almost every Loop currently running we had to fix using backup data. So where do you think it came from?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought hard for a moment before the light of comprehension dawned in her eyes. &quot;Fiction! You back up one universe in another as works of fiction! And the Hub is the only universe that has fiction about every Loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Close,&quot; Sleipnir agreed. &quot;When one universe&#039;s data is stored in another as backup, the inhabitants of the hosting universe inevitably write fiction about the universe being backed up. But you&#039;re right about the Hub. It&#039;s the only universe used to back up all other universes Yggdrasil runs, which is why the Hub itself is being used to Anchor the entire multiverse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Hub is its own Anchor?&quot; Rainbow&#039;s eyes nearly crossed in confusion. &quot;How does that work?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Sleipnir explained. &quot;The Hub is the <i>multiverse&#039;s</i> Anchor, keeping Yggdrasil itself stable through all the other Anchors in the Loops. As a result, damage to the Hub affects the Anchors through that connection and to a lesser extent the other loopers and the entire multiverse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How dost the damage from this event affect us?&quot; Luna asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Loop we lost is simply <i>gone</i>,&quot; Sleipnir reiterated. &quot;At the <i>conceptual</i> level. It effectively never existed. Any fused Loops you had with that universe have now never happened. Aside from the forced system–wide reset of the Loops the collapse triggered, even the divine operators of Yggdrasil have no memory of it beyond an almost completely corrupted file of the &#039;jumpstart&#039; attempt with a fused Loop that ended in its destruction.&quot;</p><p class="double">Eyes were wide around the room as they all tried to wrap their minds around the totality of such destruction.</p><p class="double">&quot;On a more tangible note,&quot; the divine beast continued, &quot;the emergency reset has in all likelihood set every active Looper to &#039;Awake&#039; status across the board, you might even have a few new loopers for added stability. It&#039;s a little hard to tell at the moment as everyone not sent to make sure the Anchors were fine is running around trying to assess the full extent of any secondary damage.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You said that this resulted from a fused Loop as part of a &#039;jumpstart&#039; attempt,&quot; Celestia cut in. &quot;What exactly does that mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Some universes were damaged to the point that we can&#039;t get them properly anchored without the assistance of existing loopers,&quot; Sleipnir answered. &quot;I believe Fluttershy is familiar with one of the more successful Anchors activated this way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean Lemon Rush?&quot; Fluttershy perked up. &quot;Is he okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Gilda gave Fluttershy an incredulous look. &quot;He probably took whatever floored little miss friendship graduate and beat it to a pulp.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sleipnir agreed. &quot;He is a very hardy and stable Anchor. You should be proud.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blushed.</p><p class="double">&quot;But as I was saying,&quot; the eight–legged stallion continued, &quot;the fused Loop was the latest attempt to get a particularly damaged universe to start looping. The baseline suffered severe damages, and even the viable Anchors are all damaged to some extent. And yes,&quot; Sleipnir rolled his eyes as he saw the inevitable tangent forming before him, &quot;this has happened before. When we have a damaged Anchor candidate, it&#039;s standard procedure to move down the list to secondary and even tertiary Anchor candidates to get the Loop functional. Your friends the Turtles are victims of a damaged baseline. Yggdrasil can no longer tell which of their major variants is the true baseline and I understand the situation has created some rather unique mental stress issues. Your friend Sonic has been confined to variant Loops because we still haven&#039;t repaired his baseline to the point where it&#039;s viable. I doubt he&#039;d even recognize his true history at this point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s keeping you from fixing it?&quot; Rainbow interrupted before Sleipnir could get back to the main topic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sonic&#039;s baseline has multiversal travel outside the myriad of branching variants, which creates at least as many headaches as baseline time travel. The DC and Marvel Loops were so hard to get functional that we almost set them to Read–Only, the absolute last resort to keep a universe from being lost. We can&#039;t get Sonic&#039;s baseline functional because not all of the universes that it interacts with in its baseline are looping yet. The universe we were trying to jumpstart is actually the last one we need to finally get Sonic&#039;s baseline fully functional.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the problem you have is...?&quot; Rainbow prodded as if she hadn&#039;t distracted from the topic in the first place.</p><p class="double">&quot;The problem we have,&quot; Sleipnir answered good naturedly, &quot;is that this particular universe was the single most critically damaged of all due to being in closest proximity to the event that caused the initial damage to Yggdrasil. All attempts to get it looping have failed, the latest, as you now know, in a manner that destroyed an existing Loop. The reason why we keep trying is that we think that something in this universe may have born witness to the event that damaged Yggdrasil and give us information that could aid in repairing the damage.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is there anything we can do to help?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing that you do not already do,&quot; Sleipnir apologized. &quot;We can&#039;t risk any other Loops collapsing through contact with this universe until we get it stabilized. And the Loop that was lost... I&#039;m afraid there&#039;s absolutely nothing you can do at all at your current dimensional level, and we&#039;d very much prefer you don&#039;t ascend past the dimensional boundaries of your Loop. Even those of you not the Anchor. While the chance of your Loop being lost is... less than if the Anchor ascends, it&#039;s still rather significant.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We kinda figgered,&quot; Applejack gave Sleipnir a flat stare.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not to say what you all do isn&#039;t helpful,&quot; Sleipnir offered. &quot;Simply looping and remaining metaphysically stable helps more than I&#039;m allowed to say. The fact that you all have, of your own volition, offered sanctuary to other loopers who visit Equestria is more than we could have ever asked of you. That you manage to succeed despite the numerous significantly dangerous hostile entities native to your Loop is nothing short of a miracle. You&#039;ve already managed to avert at least one potential metaphysical collapse of another Anchor, likely saving miss Clearwater&#039;s entire Loop in the process. You have already gone above and beyond the duty assigned to you as loopers, and I hope you all continue to do so. I am honoured beyond words to be your assigned administrator.&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire room blushed at the praise.</p><p class="double">&quot;And do keep up the antics, please.” Sleipnir winked. “I&#039;ve won the &#039;funniest Loop videos&#039; contest a few times now and I&#039;d like to get a good winning streak going.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.13 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stumbled. Waking up in mid–stride was always a pain...even if there were soft, fluffy clouds to land on here.</p><p class="double">And then the loop memories rolled in and Twilight completely forgot her irritation. She was in Cloudsdale&#039;s flight camp as a pegasus filly.</p><p class="double">More importantly, for some reason Twilight was now Rainbow Dash. Literally. Looking at herself revealed she was in Dash&#039;s body. Blue mane, rainbow mane and tail, and...no cutie mark at all.</p><p class="double">Right, because &#039;Rainbow Dash&#039; had just challenged two bullies to a race for her friend Fluttershy&#039;s honour. Fluttershy seemed to be the normal non–looping Fluttershy, but Twilight would double–check her and the rest of her friends later.</p><p class="double">At the moment, a priceless opportunity had appeared. This was the race that Dash had gotten her cutie mark in. Twilight would never have a better chance to earn a different cutie mark from her usual starburst!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">This was it! Twilight tore through the air as she dove for the last ring on the course, feeling the resistance from the sound barrier build and build...and BREAK!</p><p class="double"><b>BOOM!</b></p><p class="double">Rocketing upwards, Twilight could see the Sonic Rainboom roll out below her. In Dash&#039;s body, she had Dash&#039;s magical signature, so it still looked the same. And as she felt the tingle on her flanks, Twilight&#039;s gaze eagerly turned to her new cutie mark –</p><p class="double">– of her familiar starburst. Granted, each star was a different colour this time, but still!</p><p class="double">&quot;OH COME ON!&quot;</p><p class="double">Later, Twilight would hypothesize that since the Sonic Rainboom had formed a connection between her and her friends, it fell under &#039;the magic of friendship&#039;. Right now, she was just incredibly disappointed. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.14 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around her as she Awoke. Grass! The book! THE TREE! She laughed out loud, kissing the ground and rolling in the field. &quot;Equestria again! Thank Celestia, Equestria again!&quot;</p><p class="double">It took her some time to stop celebrating, but eventually she managed to contain herself. She tilted her head, concentrating, and with a flash a tiara appeared on her forehead. Her face broke out into a wide grin. She quickly concentrated on ascending, then teleported off. A moment later she teleported back, carefully picking up the book, before teleporting away again.</p><p class="double">The library! Exactly as she remembered, exactly as she recalled from loop after loop after loop! She ran her hooves over the shelves, giggling like a schoolfilly. Home. Nothing like...</p><p class="double">Her joy faded.</p><p class="double">Nothing like.... that loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Twilight!&quot; Dash walked in with a smile. &quot;You&#039;re here early! I gotta admit that experiment we did was pretty neat, what are we going to do next?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight said nothing.</p><p class="double">The pegasus frowned, walking up to her friend and gently poking her. &quot;Um... Twi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was a high school.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My last loop. High school. Human. Nobody else awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash noticed the tremor in her voice. &quot;Um... That... kind of sounds like it would be something an egghead like you would love–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I COULDN&#039;T STUDY!&quot; Twilight whirled around, tears in her eyes. &quot;Every time, every time I tried, some, something happened! A guy would, or, or sometimes even a girl, and, and there were clubs! Actual clubs that people kept trying to pressure me into! I just wanted to learn! I didn&#039;t want, to, to... to....&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender alicorn folded in on herself, starting to cry. Rainbow, awkwardly, wrapped her in a hug as she rocked back and forth. &quot;...you&#039;re back here, Twilight. Nopony will... I&#039;ll make sure you&#039;re left alone for as long as you need it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...and I couldn&#039;t stop them,&quot; she murmured. &quot;There was too much of... of me for them to, to, and the back pain, and my magic didn&#039;t work, and the force didn&#039;t work, and I couldn&#039;t access my subspace pocket...&quot; Twilight turned to her friend. &quot;We&#039;re never experimenting with the sun again. I don&#039;t want go back there. I never want to go back there.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.15</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s just <i>brilliant,</i>” Twilight said with a sigh. “Trixie got inducted into a cult.”</p><p class="double">“To be honest,” Chrysalis supplied, eyes somewhat unfocussed, “she&#039;s only pretending to go along with it. She&#039;s a good actor.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Ah, mind link, of course.” Twilight nodded. “Any plans?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not entirely sure I&#039;m permitted to attack them.” Shining frowned. “They&#039;re Inevitables, right? Those are supposed to be things of order. And, you know... paladin...”</p><p class="double">“They&#039;re broken.” Twilight shrugged. “Definitely not both good and orderly, at most one of the above.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” The paladin touched his maul. “Good to know.”</p><p class="double">“Hey,” Gilda said suddenly. “Paladins are holy warriors, right? Whose are you?”</p><p class="double">Cadence waved.</p><p class="double">“Is that allowed?” Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">“Apparently. I suspect Cadence might well be a Favoured Soul of Shining, as well.” Twilight drew a crude map on the floor. “Okay, here&#039;s the plan...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Three, two, one...”</p><p class="double">“Wait!” Cadence hissed, just before they all started casting or charging. “Look.”</p><p class="double">Through the slight haze of Twilight&#039;s Invisibility Sphere, they could see that Trixie was waving a hoof.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Trixie said, clearing her throat. “Ah–herm. I am glad to be able to speak to the full roster of the Redeemed. I would like to say something very important.”</p><p class="double">The variety of crazy Inevitables and cultist followers looked at her expectantly.</p><p class="double">“Friends, Redeemed, and fellow travellers,” she began, and took a deep breath. “Maximized Empowered Twinned Concussive Sonic Wild Surge <i>ENERGY BURST!</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Now that&#039;s what I call a distraction,” Twilight said approvingly, as cultists went flying and dust rained down from the ceiling.</p><p class="double">“Shut up and attack!” Gilda shouted, blade already humming as she launched herself forward.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cadence frowned down at Trixie. “Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“Table for two please!” Trixie said clearly.</p><p class="double">“Apparently not...” She lit her horn, raised Trixie onto her hooves, and slapped a Restoration spell on her. “How much power did you use?”</p><p class="double">“All of it,” Trixie said, sounding slightly hurt. “Why do you even ask?”</p><p class="double">“Figures.” Chrysalis trotted over, rolling her eyes. “Okay, Trix. If you&#039;re this determined to stick to the rules of the loop, I&#039;d better at least recharge you.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis lowered her head to touch her horn to Trixie&#039;s, and after a moment her horn lit with a soft green light.</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s horn answered about ten seconds later, and a full minute passed before they separated.</p><p class="double">“All fine?” Trixie asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Chrysalis replied. “That&#039;s a good power combo Twilight worked out for me, you know... full recharge is <i>so</i> convenient.”</p><p class="double">She touched Trixie on the nose. “But make sure you at least think of an escape plan next time!”</p><p class="double">“Escape plan?” Trixie looked dubious. “Why would I need one of those?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nipped her shoulder. “You know very well why. Resurrections are expensive.”</p><p class="double">There was a shower of sparks in the background, as Gilda and Shining took turns poking one of the Inevitables. Neither of the psions noticed.</p><p class="double">Then something flashed next to them.</p><p class="double">Trixie whirled, her horn already lit with an Energy Blast. “Cadence!”</p><p class="double">Cadence stowed the camera in her subspace pocket. “That&#039;s one for the album. You looked so cute!”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed, tapping a hoof on the floor. <i>It&#039;s going to take a long time to live that one down...</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">45.16</p><p class="double">“Ah, I&#039;ve always wanted to see the Gryphon Lands,” Rarity said, gazing out the window.</p><p class="double">Spike chuckled, kneeling beside her. “I&#039;m fairly sure you&#039;ve been before. In fact, didn&#039;t you invade once?”</p><p class="double">“That was just one time,” Rarity replied, blushing. “I had... self control issues.”</p><p class="double">“I know, I know.” Spike kissed her cheek, feeling an electric thrill run through him at the contact. Though they&#039;d been dating for <i>so</i> long, and <i>really</i> serious for a large fraction of that... being actually married made it all new again.</p><p class="double">Rarity returned the favour, nuzzling into his neck. “You know what I mean, of course. It&#039;s rare that we get to just look around.”</p><p class="double">There was a muted <i>whump</i> from the gas bag of the huge airship. From experience, both of them recognized it as heated air being released from the balloonets.</p><p class="double">“There goes the superheat,” Spike commented. “Not long until we arrive now.”</p><p class="double">Rarity grinned. “Not tempted to fly down?”</p><p class="double">“Well, a bit...” he allowed.</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave it some serious thought.</p><p class="double">“No, let&#039;s just use the docks as normal. It&#039;s been a long trip, and I feel like a nice dinner.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;m... sorry?” the waiter asked politely. “You would like the vegetarian option?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Rarity said patiently. “I&#039;m a <i>pony.</i> We don&#039;t eat meat.”</p><p class="double">“I am not sure that anyone has ordered the vegetarian option... since I was first hired, actually,” he admitted. “I will see if the chefs can remember how to do it.”</p><p class="double">“Not a good sign,” Spike said with a wince as the griffin walked off.</p><p class="double">“No, it isn&#039;t.” Rarity sighed. “I wonder where Blueblood ate when he came here last?”</p><p class="double">“In his suite.” Spike rolled his eyes. “I spoke with the servants who came here with him, once. They just ate fast food.”</p><p class="double">“My most sincere apologies, madam,” the waiter said, eyes downcast as he returned. “None of the chefs can recall what an aubergine looks like in the first place, let alone how to cook it.”</p><p class="double">“Oh well,” Spike said, shrugging, and reached into a pouch slung across his torso. Extracting a few bits, he tossed them to the waiter. “Not your fault.”</p><p class="double">Accepting the tip, the waiter bowed them out, still apologizing.</p><p class="double">“Well, that was a bust...” Rarity looked ruefully back at the five-star restaurant. “I suppose that&#039;s the downside of foreign food.”</p><p class="double">“Gustav was alright...” Spike shrugged. “Maybe he left because he wasn&#039;t properly respected, though. Well, looks like it&#039;s fast food time.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You know,” Rarity said, staring up at the stars, “I&#039;m surprised just how many kinds of fast food the Griffins have.” She levitated a nut out of their bag and slit it open with delicate care, then hovered the meat of the nut over to Spike.</p><p class="double">Spike cracked a walnut, ate the bits Rarity had passed him, then returned the favour. “Well, we tend to think of the Gryphon Lands as a country, like ours – formed from, fundamentally, a single source of colonists. But this is a continent of diverse tastes.”</p><p class="double">He bit off the end of a kebab skewer, and chewed thoughtfully on the peppers, chicken and iron. “How&#039;s yours?”</p><p class="double">“Convenient.” Rarity lifted herself a little to better eat the pita. “I&#039;m a little surprised they do a vegetarian version of this, though.”</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s so you can taste the cheese.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So.” Rarity wiped her mouth with a napkin. “What should we do tomorrow?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m thinking... the temple complex at Hightown. You know, that one built into the side of a cliff.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good.”</p><p class="double">It also sounded a little scary, of course... but with Spike there, Rarity didn&#039;t feel afraid of falling.</p><p class="double">That she could literally grow wings on the way down helped, too. A little.</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>46.1 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;This is just weird,&quot; Sweetie Belle commented at recess. &quot;I mean, none of us had any plans to shake things up. Well, outside of Trixie&#039;s thing with the dragon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That was more a &#039;what would she do&#039; then anything,&quot; Scootaloo pointed out. &quot;And it&#039;s still early in the loop. Maybe Diamond has some sort of secret prank she&#039;s planning on Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. &quot;Nnnnno. No, Ah don&#039;t think she was planning anythang. No offence to ya&#039;ll but... Well, Ah can read her better then you two, and she seemed pretty normal yesterday.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think she got sick?&quot; Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;If she were sick Filthy Rich would have sent Cheerilee a note,&quot; Sweetie pointed out, glancing at the schoolhouse. &quot;Do you think we should check in on her?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom looked across the playground. &quot;Maybe... but first we should go talk to Silver over thar.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crusaders all turned toward the little grey filly sitting alone on a bench, her tail flicking idly as she focused on quietly chewing her food. She&#039;d glance up, occasionally, taking in her classmates playing around before she simply sighed and returned to snipping off tiny bites of her meal.</p><p class="double">&quot;...yeah, that might be a good idea,&quot; Sweetie agreed. &quot;She doesn&#039;t look too happy.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three of them trotted over to the bench, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle sitting to either side of Silver Spoon as Scootaloo stood off to the side. The grey filly glance up and them and sneered, her eyes almost completely free of tears. &quot;What do <i>you</i> all want?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo raised an eyebrow. &quot;Well, I personally want to revolutionize the field of aeronautics and join the Wonderbolts. I&#039;m pretty sure Sweetie here wants to become a pop star, and Apple Bloom wants to build an army of robots to do her bidding.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not an army,&quot; Apple Bloom countered blandly. &quot;Ah&#039;d be fine with a small squad o&#039; twelve, Ah&#039;m not greedy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon blinked at them. &quot;...what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You asked us what we wanted,&quot; Scootaloo explained.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, see – what do you want with <i>me?</i>&quot; the grey filly demanded, trying to get a hold of the situation.</p><p class="double">&quot;We saw ya sitting here alone and we figured... nopony should be alone.&quot; Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Cliche, yeah, but....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t want to talk to <i>you,</i>&quot; Silver grumbled, picking up her lunch and standing. &quot;I&#039;m going somewhere else.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle put a gentle hoof on her shoulder. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. Whatever we did... I&#039;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pushed the hoof off and glared at the unicorn. &quot;Look, I don&#039;t know where she is, so stop bugging me!&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom tilted her head. &quot;Where who is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Diamond Tiara!&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rolled her eyes. &quot;What does Tiara have to do with anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I...&quot; Silver faltered, but rallied herself quickly. &quot;That&#039;s obviously why you&#039;re talking to me! You want to find, find out where she is!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We <i>are</i> worried about her,&quot; Sweetie allowed, &quot;but right now we&#039;re honestly more concerned about you. Diamond can take care of herself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There! That!&quot; Silver Spoon pointed at the unicorn. &quot;How do you KNOW that?! You&#039;ve only been friends with her for, like, a week! And somehow she&#039;s... not her! You changed her!&quot;</p><p class="double">The crusaders shared a look. Ah.</p><p class="double">&quot;And what was that?! What aren&#039;t you–?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She still considers you a friend,&quot; Sweetie interjected swiftly. &quot;Really. We never meant to steal her from you... it&#039;s just...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think Silver would believe us without proof,&quot; Scootaloo interjected. &quot;And, well... you know what Nyx told us about how Twilight felt when Fleur and Flash ended up, um–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m right here!&quot; the grey filly huffed. &quot;Why are you ignoring me?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom took a breath. &quot;...Silver, there is... a really big secret, but Ah think it should be up ta Diamond whether we tell ya or not.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right, let me guess. You&#039;re all princesses.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo grinned broadly.</p><p class="double">&quot;...no.&quot; Silver Spoon boggled. &quot;You&#039;re joking, that can&#039;t be right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Scoots, stop messing with her mind.&quot; Sweetie Belle rolled her eyes. &quot;No, we aren&#039;t princesses.&quot; <i>This loop, anyway...</i> &quot;Look... Diamond Tiara really cares about you. Really. She&#039;s always worried when you&#039;re not around.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...she is?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom nodded solemnly. &quot;Yep. Can&#039;t get through a day without wondering if she should have brought you along...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....oh.&quot; The grey filly scuffed at the ground, not meeting their eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You know,&quot; Sweetie Belle mused, &quot;real friends will forgive each other no matter what. Even after the worst argument.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver&#039;s eyes snapped up. &quot;How did you know about that--?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were telegraphing it so obviously that even <i>I</i> noticed,&quot; Scootaloo deadpanned.</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave her a look. &quot;I was trying to be <i>subtle.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever you said can&#039;t have been that bad, though,&quot; Scootaloo continued obliviously.</p><p class="double">&quot;I said I hated her and wished she&#039;d change back to normal...&quot; Silver admitted quietly.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom sighed. &quot;Tell ya what. You get miss Cheerilee to set whatever assignments she has for us aside, and we&#039;ll go find Diamond so that you two can talk. Alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I...&quot; Silver Spoon sighed. &quot;...Alright...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.2 (misterq)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;We have a pattern... Red? No, w..white? A pink pattern? What does this mean?&quot; Misato stared at the screen.</p><p class="double">Shinji blinked, trying to sort through his extensive loop memories. A pink pattern could mean one of a few different types of looping angels. He kind of hoped it would be the angel version of Dan Hibiki.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where is it?&quot; the third child asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s nearby. The magi are having a hard time locking on. It&#039;s over the water, no wait – twenty miles out. Fifteen miles southwest. Now it&#039;s three miles to the north. I can&#039;t pinpoint its location.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you tried looking right behind you?&quot; asked a high pitched, yet helpful voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, we haven&#039;t looked......&quot; Misato stopped mid-sentence and everyone in the NERV control center slowly turned around.</p><p class="double">Shinji paled as he recognized that particular pink-coated pony, who was now apparently the fourth angel – Pinkiel.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there!&quot; the adorable abomination chirped. &quot;Do you all like parties?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shinji thought frantically. He remembered what a looping Pinkie Pie was capable of. Still, there had to be a safe way of diffusing the situation.</p><p class="double">That was when his father pulled out his pistol and fired six rapid shots at the pink pony – who was suddenly no longer standing where she had been.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! You got me gifts!&quot; Pinkie was now on top of a computer monitor, balancing on her back two legs while happily juggling six spent bullets, &quot;But I didn&#039;t get you anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I can show you a magic trick! Watch this! Nothing up my sleeves,&quot; The pink pony gestured at her front forelegs and giggled, adding, &quot;Because I&#039;m naked!&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she reached behind her back and into her mane and pulled out a large cupcake. A cupcake topped with the embryo of Adam, the first angel.</p><p class="double">One quick gulp later and it was gone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm! Instrumentalicious!&quot; Pinkie licked her lips of any loose crumbs as she started glowing, &quot;Oh, I guess that&#039;s the ball game. Go team Angel!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a bright flash of light.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Get up Shinji! You&#039;ll be late for school.&quot;</p><p class="double">After having more than a few loops together, Shinji recognized the voice to be his mother&#039;s.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m awake. What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">Yui Ikari walked into his bedroom, &quot;Did you stay up too late yesterday? If you want, I can call your school and tell them you partied too hard yesterday.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Partied? What was yesterday?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yesterday was a party day,&quot; Shinji only now realized that his mother was wearing a t-shirt that read, &#039;If you can read this, you&#039;re far too sober!</p><p class="double">&quot;Party day?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right. A day dedicated to celebrating the joy and wonder found in life. But don&#039;t worry, Shin-chan. Today is a party day, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are... are there any days that are not party days?&quot;</p><p class="double">Yui looked aghast at such a thought, &quot;What would be the fun of a non-&#039;party day&#039; day? Now I&#039;m off to work at the balloon factory. If you decide to go to school, bus fare is on the table. I&#039;ll have to stop by your father&#039;s work and make sure he gets the lunch he forgot. I swear, he would leave his head if he didn&#039;t need it for his job managing the cookie mines.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shinji just stared as his mother put on a silly party hat and left the apartment. Happy dance music could be heard outside while the front door was open. He went to the living room and cautiously turned on the television. A lady dressed as a harlequin was announcing the weather – an eighty percent chance of confetti with possible flurries of glitter later in the evening.</p><p class="double">The former Eva pilot just sat there in a dazed state on his couch, only barely noticing that it was made from one giant marshmallow. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(addendum, from FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">I Am.</p><p class="double">Or Am I? I forget. And I&#039;m not sure which bits are supposed to be spoken in Big Important Capital Letters. Is there a guide for this somewhere?</p><p class="double">Anyway... oh, right, all the ominous threats and &quot;Grr, I&#039;m awesome, fear me&quot; stuff. And something about &quot;the Base Earth,&quot; but really, that just seems kind of racist. Unless it&#039;s in the sense of there being an Acid Earth somewhere.</p><p class="double">What? What do you mean I&#039;m out of time? Who&#039;s in charge of this recording studio, anyway?</p><p class="double"><i>Fiiiine</i>.</p><p class="double">I am the Pony of Celebration.</p><p class="double">The Joy of Faust.</p><p class="double">I am Pinkiel. I have come. To party. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.3</p><p class="double">“Observe, Ponyville, the multitudinous talents of the Great and Powerful Trixie!” Trixie called, setting off a few fireworks.</p><p class="double">“Why do I have to wear the bunny suit?” Chrysalis grumbled.</p><p class="double">“For two reasons. First, all magicians&#039; assistants have to wear sparkly bunny suits,” Trixie informed her.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked unimpressed. Her current form was that of a black-coated pegasus with a crystalline flower for a cutie mark, so the bunny suit merely looked <i>mostly</i> ridiculous.</p><p class="double">“Second,” Trixie coughed. “I like seeing you in a bunny suit.”</p><p class="double">At that, the disguised Changeling perked up a bit.</p><p class="double">There were a few chuckles from those of the audience close enough to hear the by-play.</p><p class="double">“Right!” Trixie said, getting back into the swing of things. “The first trick that the Great and Powerful Trixie shall do, is the disappearing coin trick!”</p><p class="double">She looked over to Chrysalis. “Lend me a coin, will you?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not falling for that again!” Chrysalis protested. “Not after the last fifty times.”</p><p class="double">More giggles.</p><p class="double">“Fine then.” Trixie looked off into the distance for a moment, theatrically sighing and frowning. “What about this?”</p><p class="double">She reached behind Chrysalis&#039; ear, and pulled a bit from behind it.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s just pathetic,” Chrysalis griped. “I&#039;ve seen that before.”</p><p class="double">Another bit fell out from behind her ear. Then another. With a clinking rush of wealth, at least fifty bits poured out from behind Chrysalis&#039; ear, leaving her looking quite confused.</p><p class="double">“Oh, so <i>that&#039;s</i> where they keep disappearing to,” Trixie said, nodding. “Mystery solved.”</p><p class="double">“Are there any more back there?” Chrysalis asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">Trixie reached back again, this time with both hooves. “Hold on a minute, I think there is something...”</p><p class="double">There was a series of <i>clang</i> noises. Then the sound of something heavy falling over, a croak as though from a frog, two snatches of music, and the noise a plate makes when it spins around on the floor.</p><p class="double">“Got it!” Trixie announced, flourishing her prize – a large red stick with a lit fuse.</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Chrysalis pointed. “Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“Use my title!” Trixie snapped, waving the stick around.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rolled her eyes. “Oh, Great and Powerful Trixie. You&#039;re holding an explosive.”</p><p class="double">“Eh?” Trixie brought it up to her face to examine it.</p><p class="double">BOOM.</p><p class="double">Both unicorn and faux-pegasus blinked away soot from their eyes.</p><p class="double">“...ignore that!” Trixie called, wiping her face clean with a towel. “Now, where was Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, you tell me,” Chrysalis snarked.</p><p class="double">“Ah, the classic! A rabbit from a hat!” Trixie swept her hat off her head, reached in up to the shoulder, and pulled out Angel.</p><p class="double">“Ta-da!”</p><p class="double">Angel bit her hoof.</p><p class="double">“Ow!” Trixie leapt a foot into the air. “Chryssy! Catch that bunny!”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis lunged forward, missed Angel completely, and fell into the hat.</p><p class="double">Angel bounced off, throwing a carrot as a parting shot.</p><p class="double">“...oops.” Trixie picked up her hat and shook it. “Are you okay in there?”</p><p class="double">“Get me out of here!” a slightly echoey version of Chrysalis&#039; voice demanded.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned the hat upside down and shook it. Two more rabbits (less violent than Angel), a cheese wedge, a spare cloak, three magazines and a wardrobe crashed out.</p><p class="double">Then there was a loud splash, and some water pattered out of the opening.</p><p class="double">“Are you in the swimming pool?” Trixie asked, moving the hat right side up again.</p><p class="double">“Not quite,” Chrysalis replied, over the sound of running water. “I think this might be the games room.”</p><p class="double">Trixie frowned. “There&#039;s no water in the games room!”</p><p class="double">“There is now,” Chrysalis said grimly. “Hold on, I can see the opening.”</p><p class="double">With an ungraceful <i>splat</i>, a black pegasus flew upside down out of the hat&#039;s innards and promptly crashed into the stage.</p><p class="double">Trixie put her hat back on (resulting in a rush of water) and lifted Chrysalis off the floor. “The rabbit escaped.”</p><p class="double">“I do not care in the slightest,” Chrysalis said distinctly. “What now?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Trixie has not done the saw-a-pony-in-half trick-”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis turned to go.</p><p class="double">“-but she supposes it may be possible to skip that?” Trixie tried.</p><p class="double">The pegasus stopped. “You&#039;d better.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“We have clearly hit on a winning formula,” Trixie said over tea that evening.</p><p class="double">“No kidding,” Spike said, putting a plate of biscuits on the table. “That was hilarious!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m glad you approve...” Chrysalis muttered. Somehow, the bunny outfit had survived unscathed through the hour or so of... postmodern magic show?</p><p class="double">“I notice that it introduced you both to Ponyville quite nicely, though,” Twilight said encouragingly.</p><p class="double">“True.” Chrysalis then shot a look over at Twilight. “Has that extra suite for Trixie and I been finished yet?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, it usually is by now when you want to stay here,” Twilight confirmed.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Chrysalis grinned suddenly. “The hive mind thinks I&#039;ve gone a bit strange, though.”</p><p class="double">“Is that-”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s accounting for the loops, yes.” The Changeling Queen then shrugged. “But it&#039;s clearly working, so they don&#039;t exactly mind.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.4</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom poured out the pre-programmed mycelium vial.</p><p class="double">The billions of tiny nanomachines suspended in solution spread as a golden haze over the surface of their target rock, eating into it, then spread to others as it turned to dust. It grew more like a plant than a machine, sinking roots into the ground and spreading micron-thin solar film to gather energy.</p><p class="double">About two minutes in, a quiet signal from Cookie indicated that the mycelium had obtained access to sufficient magically charged crystal to initiate a crystal turbine, supplying additional power and accelerating the growth process markedly.</p><p class="double">In some ways, the slow progress it was making was annoying for the engineering specialist. It would go much better in a world where electricity was common, as opposed to a small number of hydro dams.</p><p class="double">But, well, she had the time for it.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d say... about a week,” she muttered to herself.</p><p class="double">That should give it time to properly dig out the areas of space for her lab, shore them up so the roof wouldn&#039;t be troubled, and get to work building the larger machinery she was going to need.</p><p class="double">It would also give her time to select a suitable drydock location, of course. And for the inevitable arguments with the other Crusaders about just what each of them wanted to have built this loop and what would be fair.</p><p class="double">(They were still resentful of her little trick with HMS Dreadnought. Just a bit.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That can&#039;t be fair!” Scootaloo protested. “We&#039;re starting only twenty miles apart?”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Sweetie replied, eyeing the Skokaku-class aircraft carrier floating just offshore. “If we started at much further than that, then it&#039;d be a full day of you just bombing us all to bits. We <i>know</i> aircraft carriers are longer ranged-”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, and I&#039;m kinda annoyed that I&#039;m getting so nerfed by this.” Scootaloo twitched her wings. “Besides, have you <i>seen</i> how many flak guns Applebloom&#039;s got on that ridiculous <i>Yamato</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t bring the <i>Yamato</i> into this,” Applebloom said, sitting back and crossing her hooves.</p><p class="double">“Oh, for crying out loud!” Nyx slammed a hoof on the floor. “We built the things, now are we going to use them or just spend all day arguing?”</p><p class="double">Sullen muttering trailed off into silence.</p><p class="double">“Right. Now, as the referee I&#039;ll make the decision. Start fifty kilometres apart.”</p><p class="double">All of them started complaining.</p><p class="double">“See?” she pointed out. “At least all of you are unhappy.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, then, fine.” Tiara shook her head. “I suppose that&#039;ll be alright.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A dozen dive bombers tipped over, one by one, sailing down towards the mammoth battleship which was their target.</p><p class="double">Which seemed to explode beneath them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo blinked, reading off the reports in her high-tech plotting room as her entire first strike disintegrated. “Okay, what. Applebloom?” A chat connection opened. “What the hay did you just do?”</p><p class="double">“Shotgun rounds for the main guns,” Applebloom replied mischeviously. “They were part of the original equipment, but I... fixed a few glaring problems.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo sighed. “Okay, that sucks.”</p><p class="double">The connection blanked out for a moment, as the <i>Yamato</i> fired a full broadside. “Oh, hey, Tiara turned up. Stand still, dang nabbit!”</p><p class="double">The pegasus giggled; having sunk her entire allowance of resources into a destroyer flotilla at least twenty strong, Tiara was going to be a pain for any of the others to take out.</p><p class="double">That just left Sweetie to make an appearance. And she&#039;d kept her setup secret from the others, so...</p><p class="double">With a button press, Scootaloo closed the connection and started putting together a torpedo bomber strike.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The last of the fifteen Avengers rose gently from her flight deck, circled once to join the rest of the formation, and set off towards the madly evading battleship over the horizon. (A Catalina loitering well above any possible counterfire was still reporting on the battle – <i>Yamato</i> was hit once by a torpedo but still game, and Tiara was down to fifteen destroyers. Scootaloo wanted to be able to hit the winner before they could head for her.)</p><p class="double">She took a moment out on the flight deck to watch them leave. It kinda sucked that she couldn&#039;t fly the attacks herself, but – well, there weren&#039;t enough of her, and everypony who knew the Shadow Clone technique had decided not to teach it to the Crusaders. For some reason.</p><p class="double">Then Scootaloo spotted an unusual wave pattern just off the bow.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx adjusted her binoculars. “This would be so much easier if I&#039;d thought to have them make a plotting board for me...”</p><p class="double">With a bright flash, Scootaloo appeared. “Oh, come on! First down <i>again?</i>”</p><p class="double">The alicorn turned to her. “Hi, Scoots. What got you?”</p><p class="double">“Sweetie Belle.” Scootaloo removed the teleport harness, grumbling. “Ever heard of a submarine with a twelve-inch gun fitted to it? &#039;cause I have now.”</p><p class="double">Fire and flame belched out from the Yamato&#039;s position, and Diamond Tiara appeared in another flare of light. “Hard left and... oh, <i>shrub.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Shotgun rounds?” Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">“Shotgun rounds,” Tiara confirmed. </p><p class="double">They settled down to watch.</p><p class="double">“Hey, I found out what Sweetie&#039;s driving,” Scootaloo volunteered. “Submarine monitor.”</p><p class="double">Tiara giggled. “Now that&#039;ll be a surprise.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom put her spanner down. “Counterfloodin&#039; successful.”</p><p class="double">The compartments were sealed, stopping any more water getting into <i>Yamato</i>, and adding water into the port side of the ship had got her back onto an even keel.</p><p class="double">Now the only question was, where were the others?</p><p class="double">Gunfire started, with the small quick-firers blazing away on the port side. By the sound of things, Scootaloo&#039;s second strike was on the way in... torpedo bombers this time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The torpedo bomber strike hadn&#039;t been much trouble, not with the ridiculously heavy AA complement of <i>Yamato.</i> It was confusing that they&#039;d all come in on the same vector, not at all like Scoots&#039; normal flair for air tactics, but Applebloom wasn&#039;t complaining.</p><p class="double">But it was over an hour later, and still no sign of another attack. The Catalina buzzing around keeping an eye on her was getting nerve-wracking, as it happened.</p><p class="double">And there was this nagging feeling she&#039;d forgotten something.</p><p class="double">Then the <i>Jaws</i> theme started playing.</p><p class="double">“Sweetie?” Applebloom asked, checking the radar.</p><p class="double">“Peek-a-boo!” Sweetie&#039;s voice said gleefully, and then there was a very loud bang.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Ah, fiddlesticks,” Applebloom muttered. “No wonder she kept it secret...”</p><p class="double">“I could have taken her,” Tiara proclaimed. “I have ASDIC.”</p><p class="double">“Had,” Scootaloo corrected.</p><p class="double">“Er...” Nyx looked down from the cloud. “Any idea when she&#039;s coming up 3?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.5</p><p class="double">“Right,” Queen Twilight said, with a deep sigh. “Now, since you&#039;re all past your majority-”</p><p class="double">She broke off to glare at Nyx. “<i>And</i> you. I&#039;ve been keeping track.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked embarrassed, then with a flash of magic aged up to the same as her sisters. They looked somewhere between just-post-elements Luna and Cadence.</p><p class="double">“You mean she wasn&#039;t just ageing slowly?” Diamond Tiara asked Applebloom.</p><p class="double">Applebloom shrugged. “As if I&#039;d know.”</p><p class="double">“As I was saying,” Twilight resumed, ignoring the peanut gallery. “Since you&#039;ve reached adulthood, you get to take on responsibility.”</p><p class="double">“Do we have to?” Scootaloo asked with a hint of whine.</p><p class="double">“Scootaloo,” Twilight said pointedly. “Why are we currently in the New Annexe?”</p><p class="double">“...&#039;cause we burned down Canterlot Palace, the Old Annexe and the Canterhorn,” Scootaloo admitted. “Tryin&#039; to get a princess specialization for something something volcano.”</p><p class="double">“Turns out that a volcano isn&#039;t just a mountain doused in resinous pine sap and set alight,” Sweetie added. “Who knew?”</p><p class="double">“Everypony who&#039;s ever looked at a geology textbook?” Tiara asked.</p><p class="double">“Shush, you&#039;re not helping.”</p><p class="double">“As I was saying,” Twilight dragged them back on topic, “I&#039;ve been sorting out various catastrophes you lot have been causing for just about half of my time awake for the last fifteen years.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, four of those years were before we Awoke,” Sweetie said with a pout. “Those don&#039;t count!”</p><p class="double">“In short, I need a break. Seriously. Divide things up amongst yourselves, I&#039;m off for a nap. And the country better be in good shape when I get back!”</p><p class="double">Twilight flashed purple, and vanished. In her place was an ornate document assigning the five of them as co-princesses regnant.</p><p class="double">They were all silent for a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“...hey, cool,” Sweetie said eventually. “I know how this is supposed to work. Mom&#039;s away for the day-”</p><p class="double">“-century,” Applebloom contributed, nodding up at the sky. They looked, and saw a constellation spread across half the night.</p><p class="double">It was a good likeness.</p><p class="double">“When did she learn that?” Tiara wondered.</p><p class="double">“I <i>did</i> overhear her say that moons were a bit passé a few loops ago,” Nyx volunteered. “She may have gotten tips from Okami Shiranui about it.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway. She&#039;s away for a while, and... well, the usual thing to do is party.”</p><p class="double">“Can we really sustain it for a century?” Applebloom asked, then frowned and got out a computer. “Actually, we probably <i>could</i>. For given values of party.”</p><p class="double">“Golden age?” Scootaloo suggested. “Dances every night? Flowering of art and culture? Designated ruler and the rest of us getting drunk?”</p><p class="double">“This might be a bad idea...” Nyx said, nervously.</p><p class="double">“Oh, sure,” Applebloom said with a shrug. “We&#039;re not stupid, we&#039;ll stop if it&#039;s not working. But – well, look at it this way. When have we <i>ever</i> had a chance to have proper college-style parties?”</p><p class="double">“Looking at it that way, it&#039;s good for us.” Sweetie put on a pious expression, fooling precisely nopony. “Experiences we haven&#039;t had before.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara grinned. “Bet I can make a real archaeologist&#039;s dream of a jewellery industry!”</p><p class="double"></p><p>46.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Silver Spoon stared at her friend.</p><p class="double">Well.... at the pony that had once been her friend and probably would be again once she finished processing this.</p><p class="double">&quot;...this is crazy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara tapped her hoof against the table. &quot;Yeah, it&#039;s... pretty insane. Especially since...&quot; She trailed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;...since...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Erm. The entire reason you&#039;re Awake now is, uh...&quot; The pink filly sighed. &quot;You know how I said we&#039;re not the only universe? One of the other universes just... collapsed.&quot; She shuddered. &quot;Gone. Completely. Like... even the memories of that universe are gone, and all the admins have are a few corrupted files.

You didn&#039;t deserve to see me as a drill Sargent, I just... I didn&#039;t know how to comfort you. I&#039;m... not good with that.&quot; Diamond sighed. &quot;In all seriousness, when it comes to Yggdrasil, you should leave things to the admins. They make mistakes, but... they know what they&#039;re doing for the most part.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them sat quietly for a long while.</p><p class="double">&quot;...you&#039;ve changed,&quot; Silver Spoon said finally.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve had literally millennia of experiences,&quot; Diamond Tiara pointed out. &quot;Occasionally in one loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Silver Spoon pushed her chair back and got up. &quot;I...

I... maybe one day we&#039;ll be friends. Real friends. But right now... we don&#039;t even really know each other, the real each other, Tiara.&quot; She shook her head, not looking back. &quot;I would love it if we became friends but right now... no.

As a human.</p><p class="double">And that there was a large, yellow flag with a rendition of her cutie mark on it draped over the desk.</p><p class="double">At this point, she decided that it would be easier to just scan her loop memories rather than try to work it out on her own.</p><p class="double">“...huh,” she concluded intelligently, walking over to a window and looking out.</p><p class="double">She was La Presidenta, ruler of the tiny Caribbean nation of Tropico, and an absolute presidential dictator.

I&#039;ve always wondered what it was like underwater...&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy was...on a date? Okay, <i>that</i> was definitely new.

At least Fluttershy could translate for her, otherwise Twilight would never have understood what Link was &#039;saying&#039;.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Nightmare Moon will be here in two minutes. Are you sure that&#039;s all you want to use?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Link nodded, his wings shuffling a little bit as he adjusted his grip on his extremely complicated-looking slingshot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...he said, &#039;You said she can teleport, right?&#039;,&quot; Fluttershy translated.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right,&quot; Twilight responded.</p><p class="double">Right on time, Nightmare Moon burst in through the curtains and began her speech.

Time to spruce up this boring world with some of my patented <i>chaos!...</i>Eh?&quot;</p><p class="double">In front of him was a brown pegasus holding a bottle with a lit fuse attached. Without a word, the pegasus tossed the bottle to the ground just as it busted open with muffled BANG and a puff of soot. The soot fell to the ground, revealing...a chicken.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm,&quot; Discord said, studying the soot-covered chicken with a magnifying glass and ignoring the unholy look in its beady eyes, &quot;Is it Chicken Day already? How unexpected of Celestia to keep my national holidays!&quot;</p><p class="double">It took Discord another moment to realize the pegasus had taken off at a dead run. And then, crowing their wrath, the Cucco Horde descended.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Getting a Cucco into a bottle was hard.</p><p class="double">Attaching a small bomb to the bottle without angering the Cucco further was harder.</p><p class="double">Using the Cucco Horde Bomb on unsuspecting victims, Link thought to himself as he watched the carnage from several miles away, was <i>priceless.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.9 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Draco took a moment to consider his position. It was, on the whole, not very good.</p><p class="double">One: He was a travelling performer. Or rather, replacing a travelling performer. That meant no money and barely any reputation to use, which in turn meant actual work.</p><p class="double">Two: The nobility here was so... naive. There wasn&#039;t anything like blood purity or even a secret source of power. Equality was the name of the game, and that meant nothing he could do would convince the others of his inherent superiority.</p><p class="double">Three: The native anchor was angry at him and having him go through these... pointless morality lessons. Loyalty was of course something he already understood, though that rainbow pegasus had insisted that it was a &quot;two way street&quot;. Generosity and Kindness were supposed to be masks, not ideals. Honesty was simply idiotic, and laughter.... laughter was just too random to put into this already pathetic mishmash. Even magic wasn&#039;t properly represented, sounding more like Dumbledore&#039;s silly friendship nonsense then anything practical.</p><p class="double">Four: Twilight Sparkle had made it utterly clear that she or any of the other native loopers could easily make his life hell. That just wasn&#039;t fair. He was from the first five! These... ponies were damned upstarts!</p><p class="double">Which led right into the final point: He was a pony. Granted, one of the obviously superior unicorn race, but still. At least his coat was a lovely slytherin green.</p><p class="double">He did not see how this could get any worse. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Draco tromped up the library stairs, slamming the door to the gueest room open. A day of boring lectures, vile animals, tedious hard labor, inane prattle, veiled insults, and deranged giggles was over and done with. No doubt the next day would contain more of the... same...</p><p class="double">Something was stretched languidly on his bed, flicking its tattered tail idly as its mane dripped down its neck. It was very definitely female, and vaguely pony shaped, but covered in black chitin with holes in its long, slender legs. The creature was appraising him with half lidded cat eyes, its fangs gleaming in the moonlight. An eerie green glow surrounded the crooked shaft of its horn; Draco heard the door behind him swing shut.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am quite... put out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Draco Malfoy narrowed his eyes at the buzzing voice. &quot;Really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm, yes. You see, the entertainer you&#039;re replacing, she and I are... involved, shall we say.&quot; The creature slipped off the bed, cricking its neck idly. &quot;And of course I can... survive, without her. It&#039;s not too much of a problem. And yet... I find myself offended by the fact she was replaced by something as pathetic as you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Normally Draco would have shouted his own merits, but something about that statement held him back. He trotted idly round the outer edge of the room, eyes never leaving the strange beast. &quot;I apologize for my insult.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You do not mean that,&quot; the creature pointed out. &quot;It would be obvious to a non looping <i>foal</i> you did not mean that, and that is exactly why you have earned my ire. I have never visited Hogwarts, but from what I understand the house of Slytherin is supposed to be home to the cunning.&quot; She glowered at the unicorn as he moved. &quot;But you, you were sorted into that house because you were too cowardly for Gryiffindor, too stupid for Ravenclaw, and too lazy for Hufflepuff. You have no ambitions, no true cunning, and the only reason the Hat didn&#039;t expel you then and there was your connections which just barely qualified you to be in the house of snakes.&quot;</p><p class="double">He froze, his face controting in rage. &quot;...You dare to judge my worthiness? To say I have no place in Slytherin when you have never even visited--?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You have <i>no right--!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have every right, Draco Malfoy.&quot; The creature took a single step towards him. &quot;Every loop, I am in charge of a race that has to feed off of love.&quot; Another step was taken. &quot;I have to make sure my children are not starving, and to do that I have to earn the love of a non-looping populace.&quot; And another. &quot;Look at what I am, Draco. I am beautiful and hideous, and my children do not share my beauty.&quot; And another. &quot;And yet, every loop, my swarm survives. Not through force, but through crafty manipulations, through our ability to take other&#039;s forms and feel other&#039;s feelings, though coordination and sly tricks and never once has Equestria suspected a thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her breath was cold on his face. &quot;You were sorted into Slytherin, Draco Malfoy. I was <i>born</i> into it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blonde unicorn took a moment to process the words. &quot;...then we have a common enemy in Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A true Slytherin has no enemies,&quot; the creature stated as she pulled back, &quot;or at least none worth naming. Enemies are for the brave Gryffindors to fight, for the intelligent Ravenclaws to outwit, for the persevering Hufflepuffs to endure. Any creature that would be an enemy to Slytherin is to be... subverted. The reason for its opposition removed. And if that is impossible, then ensure it will also fight one of the other houses. In the baseline of this world Twilight Sparkle has every reason to hate me and my children, but as an Anchor I have convinced her to allow my nation to thrive. That is the true power that Slytherin claims. And that is the power that I will instil into you.&quot;</p><p class="double">She smiled. It was not a kind smile. &quot;The elements are telling you what their traits are, how to embody them. I will teach you how to use them properly in the house of snakes. I will teach you how to be a harmonious Slytherin. And I <i>will</i> teach you this. You would try to deny me, but I can ensure you will suffer till the loop&#039;s end. So, Draco Mal–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AVADA KEDAVRA!&quot;</p><p class="double">The creature fell dead. Draco took a moment to catch his breath before breaking out in a wide grin. Ha, as if that thing could ever–</p><p class="double">With a long, dry creak, the door swung open. He turned to see the newcomer--and his jaw dropped in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did I forget to mention? My people have a hive mind.&quot; The thing smirked. &quot;It&#039;s not possible to kill me.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Draco Malfoy fainted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow as Chrysalis giggled and hopped down the stairs. &quot;I take it things went... decently?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve played the evil queen! I&#039;ve forgotten how fun it can be!&quot; The changeling waved a casual hoof, preemptively dismissing the librarian&#039;s concerns. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, I won&#039;t let it get to me. I promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll hold you to that.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.10 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight blinked Awake, looking up from her standard book of lore...</p><p class="double">...and coming face to face with three very human looking women. &quot;Oh. Did... I do something wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We don&#039;t know yet,&quot; Urd said, conjuring up a chair and sitting down. &quot;But you did come in contact with a Skaia protocol. That means you and every other looper involved in the session need to be debriefed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sleipnir&#039;s gathering your friends up,&quot; Belldandy added. &quot;He thought it might be better for the local admin to send out the call... That and, well, we don&#039;t blend in with the natives very well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. &quot;We&#039;re in a public park...&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld crossed her arms, glaring at her sisters. &quot;I told you we should have waited for her to get to the library. But noooooo, you two had to get to her as soon as possible--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you have anything from that loop in your subspace pocket?&quot; Urd demanded. &quot;Alchemically manufactured items, sylladexs, pumpkins, ectobiology devices, anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn sighed, reaching into her mane and pulling various things out. &quot;I assume that you&#039;re going to confiscate all of this anyway...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Belldandy reassured her as Skuld began sorting through the items. &quot;Anything that could cause Skaia-type alchemy or ectobiology to develop, yes. Anything that&#039;s a danger to the loop, yes. But everything else–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Safe!&quot; Skuld tossed a wand back to Twilight, who caught it and put it to her left. &quot;Could you double check and make sure no Grist got caught in there? That happens sometimes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure.&quot; Twilight tugged at the opening of her subspace pocket, peering down into it. &quot;I&#039;ve got to warn you, though, the others don&#039;t have theirs as organized as mine, so it might take a bit for them to find anything in their pockets...&quot; Various abstract forms were swept out into the open.</p><p class="double">Urd smiled a bit. &quot;You&#039;re being very helpful, I like that. Most of the time we get people who feel cheated that they didn&#039;t get to see the universe they created.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got the librarian&#039;s attention. &quot;Wait, the genesis frog worked? I thought that the loops would--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Skaia protocol is... something we haven&#039;t quite locked down,&quot; Belldandy admitted. &quot;We got all the programs that were <i>active</i> at the time of the crash looping, although we haven&#039;t activated any loopers in them. Too many potential malicious loop entities...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The fact is enough Skaia programs got shaken loose that they started drifting.&quot; Skuld shrugged. &quot;Most of the time they go for something near the Hub, but occasionally we&#039;ll get a seed out here. We lock em down as quick as we can find them, but we usually only find them after they&#039;ve generated a new branch.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head. &quot;Why a frog, though?&quot;</p><p class="double">Urd shrugged. &quot;The guy who programmed the protocol was... weird.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway,&quot; Skuld continued, &quot;it&#039;s now standard procedure to debrief all loopers who get caught up in the Skaia protocol, check any universe they created, and see if any other problems have arisen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like prototyping a first guardian?&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;I read Homestuck before this, and I tried to ensure nothing like that happened. Um, is the looping Skaia protocol--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. It&#039;s Homestuck.&quot; Belldandy shuddered. &quot;And now you know why we will never activate anyone in there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.11 (SpaceKGreen)</p><p class="double"></p><p>He sighed as he woke up unexpectedly. He hadn&#039;t been careful enough, and as he had learned, one mistake and you had to start all over.</p><p class="double">Taking stock of his surroundings, he noticed some oddities. Everything looked... smoother. His body felt weird. Maybe this was one of those–?</p><p class="double">Unfamiliar memories flowed into his mind. At the same time, senses formed over countless years screamed at him.</p><p class="double">One word stood out.</p><p class="double"><i>DIAMONDS.</p><p class="double"></i></p><p>Applejack and Twilight stood and stared at the odd sight in the orchard.</p><p class="double">A tree stood there. More accurately, part of a tree stood there; branches swayed merrily in the breeze, ignoring the fact that a large section of trunk was missing. Every now and then one of the branches would remember that gravity existed, falling to the ground.</p><p class="double">Nearby was a strange wooden box with various pieces of wood and apples strewn about it, and next to that was a strange hole leading deep into the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;d say it was a Diamond Dog, but...&quot; began Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, Diamond Dogs don&#039;t leave floating trees. Or dig perfectly square holes.&quot; Twilight racked her memories. &quot;Hold on...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shot her a questioning glance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember that one strange loop we were in a while back? Where everything was blocky?&quot; asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, Ah remember that one. Apple Bloom an&#039; the others were thrilled with it fer some reason, Sweetie Belle especially.&quot; Applejack&#039;s eyebrows shot up. &quot;Wait. Ah thought that place was one of them universes with no Anchors or home loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So did I.&quot; Twilight admitted. &quot;It didn&#039;t seem like it was, well, fleshed out enough to have a stable loop. I heard stories from other Anchors who ended up there, and nobody seemed to have the same experience.&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked up as the last branch realized that there wasn&#039;t anything holding it up and fell with a crash. &quot;Well, it seems that we have a new Looper on our hooves. And if their home loop is different every time,&quot; her eyes widened, &quot;they probably don&#039;t even know that they&#039;re looping. This will be an interesting explanation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack peered down the hole. &quot;If&#039;n we can find them.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.12 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was late in another lonely Loop, and Twilight had gotten sucked into the enchanted comic. Once again, Spike was demonstrating the greatest superpower of all: exposition.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re the Masked Matter-Horn!&quot; he told her. &quot;You can fire all kinds of crazy power beams out of your horn!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked. &quot;Really?&quot; She&#039;d done some research after her first trip here, using nonmagical comics. The Matter-Horn was actually a pegasus who&#039;d invented a sort of artificial horn, which explained why she&#039;d had so much trouble using it the first time around. Now, however, she knew how to properly use the bizarre blend of magic and technology this subdimension insisted on. A bit of focus, a subvocalized command, and a pale blue ray shot out of her horn at a decent fraction of the speed of light.</p><p class="double">It struck the Mane-iac, who blinked and looked around, clearly confused. Her mane went still, then gently lowered her onto her hooves. &quot;I…&quot; She looked at the Electro Orb in one of her tendrils like she&#039;d never seen it before. &quot;What&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">The ponies (and dragon) were promptly ejected from the comic.</p><p class="double">The others boggled at Twilight for a bit. Spike broke the silence. &quot;What did you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;All kinds of crazy power beams,&#039; right? Well, how hard could it be for the Masked Matter-Horn to fire a beam of sanity?&quot; Twilight nuzzled her number-one assistant. &quot;Couldn&#039;t have done it without you, Spike.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.13 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">&quot;Power ponies!&quot; The Mane-iac exclaimed, &quot;How kind of you to join us.&quot;</p><p class="double">The six ponies and one dragon started stripping off their costumes.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is this?&quot; The lunatic mare grinned, &quot;So intimidated by me that you&#039;re going to give up without a fight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really,&quot; called down Twilight. &quot;We just didn&#039;t want these costumes cramping our style.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mane-iac grabbed a cart and flung it at them, only to have it caught by a purple glow of energy and set down beside them.</p><p class="double">&quot;But... none of you has that power...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack jumped off the building they were on, and dropped to the street below, cracking the pavement as she landed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I reckon you need to be more... grounded.&quot; She slammed her fore-hooves into the ground and the pavement around Mane-iac exploded upwards to encase her up to her neck.</p><p class="double">Pinkie appeared from a trash can beside her. &quot;Heh he! Good one!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Since when could Mistress Mare-velous control stone!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The name&#039;s Applejack missy, and you ain&#039;t seen the half of what I can do!&quot;</p><p class="double">Mane-iac growled and started smashing away at the stone with her hair-strands.</p><p class="double">Rarity glided down, having grown a pair of wings. &quot;Dear me, your hair is completely unmanageable. Time for a make-over!&quot;</p><p class="double">A massive pair of blue translucent shears appeared out of nowhere and started trimming away Mane-iac&#039;s locks. &quot;Noooo! My locks are impervious to even your attack constructs, Radiance.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s Rarity, and this is tectonium, a little something I whipped up to comb a mane of pure force. Which yours isn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mane-iac was half bald by now, and completely enraged. Her hair was regrowing, but Rarity was trimming it faster. &quot;When I get the electro-orb to my secret weapon...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean this electro-orb?&quot; Pinkie appeared on the opposite side of the street, holding it in a hoof</p><p class="double">Mane-iac looked at what she was holding and found it was a cupcake. &quot;How... Give it to me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh uh, you meanie-pants, you didn&#039;t say the &#039;Pinkie says&#039;...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight landed in front of her, in full floating hair princess mode and casually flicking away thrown pieces of pavement. &quot;You see, we&#039;ve fought real villains...&quot;</p><p class="double">A lock of hair that had escaped Rarity&#039;s shears formed into a needle point and speared down at her, only to be trimmed by a rainbow shockwave that reverberated along the street.</p><p class="double">&quot;... Thanks Dash, real, world ending honest to gosh, deity level threats. By comparison, you aren&#039;t even a warm-up.&quot;</p><p class="double">All the ponies had gone full floaty mane alicorn, and were letting their auras show. Mane-iac, now bald, cringed. But it was Spike who dropped off Twilight&#039;s back and strode up to her.</p><p class="double">Mane-iac gave one final snort. &quot;Letting your useless sidekick Humdrum feel like he&#039;s useful? How <i>heroic.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Spike is plenty useful. It&#039;s amazing what one of his smiles can do to convince ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, as if!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike suddenly swelled up into a great ancient wyrm and lowered his head to her level, grinning to expose teeth bigger than she was. He rumbled, &quot;Care to reconsider?&quot;</p><p class="double">But Mane-iac had fainted. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.14 (Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon screamed as soon as she left her – once – friend&#039;s home. It wasn&#039;t frustration, it was several times her weight of airborne predator snatching her up in it&#039;s talons and bearing her skyward. The filly&#039;s scream dopplered as the pale griffin bore her up and dropped her on a convenient cloud. To her shock she didn&#039;t fall through.</p><p class="double">This phenomenon stopped her screaming, as she cautiously poked the strangely solid (for an Earth Pony) cloud. &quot;Why aren&#039;t I falling through?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin responded, revealing she was a female. &quot;I compacted it so it was solid enough to walk on without magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon rubbed her hooves on the cloud. &quot;Flyers can do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin&#039;s beak split in what might have been a smile. &quot;If you are sufficiently awesome, sure. But enough about me. This is about you getting over feeling bucked by your timing for Waking Up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sliver Spoon could hear the capitalization, and spat, &quot;A Looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin nodded, &quot;Yeah, and so are you. So do we do this the Pony way and talk about how stupid your snit is? Or the Griffin way?&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly cocked her head, &quot;What&#039;s the Griffin way?&quot;</p><p class="double">The smirk on the griffin grew, &quot;I tie both forelegs behind my back and wire my beak shut, hand you something <i>really</i> powerful to give you half a chance, then there is bruising, a bit of blood, and probably a high speed dirt dive for one or both of us. We bond over the recovery, then I explain how stupid your snit is.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon looked at the Griffin. The older flyer could obviously take her even before the Loops, and afterwards... even with only her hind paws and wings, and whatever that &#039;equalizer&#039; was, she didn&#039;t fancy her chances. And it surprised her how little she cared about that gap right now, after D- after Tiara...</p><p class="double">She shoved the feeling of betrayal aside. &quot;Why don&#039;t we try the Pony way for now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Griffin&#039;s smirk got even bigger, as if she noticed her way wasn&#039;t off the table yet. She waved her tail in an oddly precise pattern and a couple of cloud couches popped up. Silver Spoon gave the griffin a look as hers was a classic psychiatrists&#039; couch, but she hoped up on it. It was a measure of how weird her day was that the colour draining back into the griffin only merited a raised eyebrow. &quot;Aren&#039;t you the Chief Weather Mare&#039;s friend?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin nodded. &quot;Yep, name&#039;s Gilda. So want to talk about why your friend looked like she just took a gut shot down there?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon didn&#039;t know why, but she just exploded. &quot;That isn&#039;t my friend! I don&#039;t know who she is! I knew Diamond Tiara, but that pony that replaced her is a stranger! YOU CAN&#039;T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT FE-&quot;.</p><p class="double">The rant was cut off suddenly. Silver Spoon hadn&#039;t seen the griffin move. Gilda was just suddenly THERE. One set of talons was clamping her muzzle shut, the other cradled the back of her skull. Silver Spoon also noticed that the griffin had gone all pale again, and the look in her eye said it would be easy to snap the filly&#039;s neck, crush her skull, or if feeling merciful just break her jaw.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are a new looper, so I&#039;ll let a lot go in the wind. But not finishing that sentence, understand?&quot; Taking the abortive nod as understanding Gilda steered the filly around to another view off the cloud. The pair were now looking over Sweet Apple Acres. &quot;A little visual aid here to show where things stand, and how much stupid nearly came out of your mouth.&quot; She pointed to the reservoir pond for the irrigation system. &quot;That pond? That&#039;s Twilight Sparkle&#039;s status as an Anchor. The mare needs to lose weight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon surprised herself at the semi-hysterical giggle at the snide remark. Gilda continued, &quot;Each tree is someone in Equestria. Get enough water from Lake Twilight and you start looping.&quot; A talon pointed at the Zap Apple orchard, the largest and oldest trees on the farm. Gilda started naming them, &quot;Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, Spike, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash. My best friend.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ignoring Silver Spoon&#039;s squeak Gilda continued pointing at trees, moving out to younger and less water hungry varieties, still naming them. &quot;Princess Celestia. Princess Luna. Twilight&#039;s brother Shining Armor. Princess Cadence, her sister-in-law. Applebloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo. I&#039;m about there and Tiara is right next to me.&quot; The talon finally pointed to a row of freshly planted saplings &quot;And you are right there. I figure the gap between me and Dashie is larger than you and Tiara.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon hardly noticed Gilda letting go, or the colour flowing back into her again as the filly flopped to the cloud. &quot;How do you ever catch up?&quot; she asked in despair.</p><p class="double">Gilda shook her head, &quot;It ain&#039;t a question of catching up chick. Let me guess, you feel like your buddy left you behind?&quot; At Silver Spoon&#039;s nod the griffin sighed, &quot;Brutal Honesty is my schtick. So here it is. One of the curses of Looping is feeling like you are leaving everyone you care about who isn&#039;t Looping behind. The feeling sucks worse than a downdraft. We hope our friends join us, and fear them doing so for how experiencing that will make them feel. You&#039;ll get it quick, because...&quot; Gilda pulled an apple from, somewhere, and bit deep into it. The bite nicked the core, exposing some apple seeds. &quot;Remember when I was pointed out trees?&quot; The griffin pointed to two seeds, &quot;These are your parents.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon&#039;s stomach dropped. &quot;Wait, if I&#039;m looping now, how long till Mom and Dad start?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda shook her head, &quot;It&#039;s not something even Twilight can put a number on. But from what I understand, your Looping is practically Divine Intervention. Sequoia willing things will be fixed before Twilight gets big enough for your parents to get watered.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon choked back a sob, &quot;How did you and Miss Dash deal with the gap?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin put a talon gently under the crying filly&#039;s chin and gave her a lopsided grin. &quot;Badly. Ran off for a few loops with Trixie and had interesting adventures trying to establish myself as a looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon had to ask. &quot;How &#039;interesting&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda chuckled. &quot;Oh Oak, oh Ash, we are all going to die.&quot; She gave another grin. &quot;I will tell you this though. No matter how busy she got. No matter how urgent the crisis. No matter how frustrated you made her at not being able to change? Every time the two of us were Awake and some version of you was in town, I always saw Diamond Tiara making time for her.&quot; </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<br /><p class="double">47.1 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash yawned and stretched out her wings. She&#039;d Awoken into a wintry world, though what could be seen through the blizzard seemed awfully familiar. For some reason her loop self had been sleeping in a tree instead of on a cloud.</p><p class="double">She got a funny reading when Dash checked the Element of Loyalty. Only Twilight was Awake, except...not here yet? That was different...hadn&#039;t Twilight mentioned a few loops where Celestia or Luna had Awoken way before Twilight had entered the loop? Cool.</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess I&#039;ll take a look around. Where am I anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Not far away was a miserable-looking village. Vaguely familiar, but Dash couldn&#039;t place it. Dash could see it was full of Earth Ponies, all of whom were struggling to work their farms, but with the sheer volume of snow coming down that was impossible. All their crops were looking more like ice sculptures in the snow. She snorted: somepony had scheduled a blizzard over this town right in the middle of summer!</p><p class="double">Well, Dash would soon fix <i>that</i>.</p><p class="double">It was filly&#039;s play for Dash to corral the storm into one spot. Feeling the eyes of the village on her, Dash couldn&#039;t resist showing off – she tore into the heart of the storm, and unleashed a Sonic Rainboom to blast it apart! She made a big show about hunting down the last clouds before coming in for a landing in the middle of the village. Most of the ponies were looking at her like she was a Timber Wolf, but one mare stepped forward cautiously after a minute.</p><p class="double">&quot;You...got rid of the snow?&quot; the mare asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course I did!&quot; Dash replied, &quot;You guys needed the help. I&#039;d never leave ponies hanging.&quot;</p><p class="double">The other ponies started whispering amongst themselves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...none of the other pegasus ponies ever bother with moving the snow. Not without demanding half our crops first,&quot; the mare said.</p><p class="double">Now that it was sunny, Dash was able to see the town a lot more clearly. And she could recognize why it looked so familiar: it was right out of that Heart&#039;s Warming Eve play they&#039;d put on in Canterlot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Dash said, &quot;Well, you know what I think about <i>that?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And then they made you their leader?&quot; Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot;</p><p class="double">As soon as Twilight had Awoken, she&#039;d realized something was up. Dash had appeared not long after and explained the whole thing, but Twilight was still confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Even though you weren&#039;t an Earth Pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! It confused the <i>frond</i> out of Platinum and Hurricane at the Summit,&quot; Dash grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;And is that related to why Equestria is...not in Equestria?&quot; Twilight added, waving a hoof at the unfamiliar landscape surrounding them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, that was Cookie&#039;s idea. I just kept the skies clear, she did all the hard parts. S&#039;why I abdicated the position of &#039;Most Awesome Boss of Earth Ponies&#039; to her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;By abdicated, you mean &#039;snuck off, Ascended, and had a thousand-year-nap&#039;, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Same thing!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings everypony, and welcome to Loops 101. Now then....&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle picked up a piece of chalk, glanced at the chalkboard, and smiled. A moment later, both went sailing away; the unicorn pulled a small metal disc out of thin air and tossed it to the ground, tapping it briefly, and suddenly there was a strange see-through bush-tree hovering and slowly rotating in front of the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;Most of you have already got the basic story from me or my friends, so this will be more a question and answer session than an actual lecture. So, recap: We&#039;re stuck in a time loop because the multiverse is broken and the people in charge don&#039;t want it to break any further while they&#039;re fixing problems.&quot; She flicked her hoof and the image changed to a simple line, with a picture of the moon on the left and a purple alicorn silhouette on the right. &quot;The loop we&#039;re in generally starts right before the Summer Sun celebration and it used to end around the time of my coronation, but recently enough damage was fixed that it&#039;s started to expand out beyond that by about a week every five hundred loops or so.&quot;</p><p class="double">With another gesture, Twilight generated a number of parallel lines, some shorter then the marked Equestria line but most far longer. &quot;Loops in other universes can range anywhere from a year to &#039;whenever everyone dies&#039; in length. If you&#039;re Awake, check your loop memories <i>as soon as possible</i> and try to discretely find the local anchor and other loopers while retaining as much of your pre-awake self as you deem appropriate. You&#039;re each going to be partnered up with a Looper you knew in the baseline to guide you through this loop, but there&#039;s no guarantee that they&#039;ll be Awake in your next loop or that you&#039;ll even be in Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to Spike, standing off to the side. &quot;How was that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually pretty good. You managed to keep your rambling down to ten minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh ha ha ha.&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes, then turned back to the group with a smile. &quot;Equestria&#039;s been declared a sanctuary loop for anybody that ends up here, a respite in all the insanity of the multiverse. Of course, we can&#039;t help others if we don&#039;t look after our own; if you ever need anything, just ask! And speaking of asking, now is the perfect time for any questions you might have.&quot;</p><p class="double">Instantly there was a flurry of raised hooves.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Twilight, I&#039;m pretty sure one of the Trek Anchors was here last loop,&quot; Fluttershy said softly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; The unicorn shelved a final book and turned around with a big grin. &quot;Did you get any evidence?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no, sorry... I was, um, too busy dealing with the new expansion period.&quot; The pegasus waved a hoof. &quot;You weren&#039;t Awake and I was curious how you&#039;d deal with that bat infestation in the baseline, so I went for a vanilla handling of things.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded with a sigh. &quot;I guess I can&#039;t blame you. I&#039;d be curious too. What ended up happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you turned me into a vampire.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....<i>what.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.4</p><p class="double">Twilight cleared her throat, just as Nightmare Moon finished her &#039;night will last forever&#039; speech. “Er-hem?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare turned. “Yes, my new subject?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn held up her old soft toy. “Smarty Pants doesn&#039;t like you.”</p><p class="double">“...is that some kind of foal&#039;s toy?” Nightmare Moon asked, glaring down at it. Then she tossed her head. “And why should I care? Answer soon, or your insolence will be punished.”</p><p class="double">Twilight hovered Smarty Pants over to her ear, and moved it in little jerks. “What&#039;s that, Smarty Pants? You think she should be nicer to you?” Lowering the toy, Twilight shrugged. “Well, you heard her.”</p><p class="double">“Are you soft in the head?” Nightmare asked incredulously. (Several of the ponies in the audience were nursing the same suspicions.)</p><p class="double">More pantomiming.</p><p class="double">“Smarty Pants thinks you should apologize.”</p><p class="double">“Twi, are you alright?” Spike asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“Me?” Twilight nodded. “I&#039;m fine. It&#039;s Smarty Pants who&#039;s taunting the dark goddess-”</p><p class="double">Twilight broke off, and consulted Smarty Pants again. “Oh, I see. You can take her? Go ahead, then.”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s horn glow vanished, and a green witchfire instead spread over Smarty Pants. The toy&#039;s eyes began to glow in several colours.</p><p class="double">“What is this?” Nightmare Moon asked, backing unconsciously. “Stop it!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not doing anything,” Twilight protested. “Smarty is, though, and she doesn&#039;t like you.”</p><p class="double">The toy turned to Twilight. Nightmare lashed out with a spell, which crashed into the green aura and vanished. The toy turned back to her for a moment, then faced Twilight and wiggled for a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“Smarty Pants is very cross,” Twilight announced.</p><p class="double">Smarty faced Nightmare Moon, and fired a beam of rainbow light.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. “Best prank in a hundred years!”</p><p class="double">Admittedly, shrinking the Rainbow of Light from the Gen 1 Loop down so it would fit inside Smarty Pants had been tricky. But the payoff was hilarious.</p><p class="double">Especially since, at Twilight&#039;s calm insistence, the stuffed toy had been the one honoured for defeating Nightmare Moon. (She&#039;d explained that the lack of movement was because Smarty Pants was tired. Celestia had just looked confused.)</p><p class="double">“Now, dealing with Discord should be interesting...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon looked around, slowly at first but then with increasing confusion. “Where am I? This isn&#039;t my bedroom!”</p><p class="double">A clanking sound issued from behind her.</p><p class="double">“Oh, great,” came a voice she recognized as that of Twilight Sparkle. “Hold on, I think I know where we are.”</p><p class="double">Silver turned, nearly tripping as two of her legs felt strangely numb, only to come face to face with...</p><p class="double">A mechanical pony. A unicorn, actually. And so much larger than her that she felt she was standing next to one of the Princesses.</p><p class="double">The riveted-steel construction face-hoofed with a clang, and sighed. “Sorry, I&#039;m not doing this right. You&#039;re Silver Spoon, aren&#039;t you?”</p><p class="double">“Y-yeah,” Silver stammered. “Where am I?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m going to need to check – I <i>hate</i> loops where I&#039;m made of metal – but I&#039;m fairly sure that we&#039;re in the world of Full Metal Alchemist.”</p><p class="double">Silver blinked. “I understood maybe four of those words.”</p><p class="double">Twilight crouched down, bringing her closer to Silver&#039;s height. “This is one of those things I called a Fused Loop. In this case, we&#039;re in the place of the main loopers of another world – think of it like we&#039;re the main characters of a story.”</p><p class="double">Reaching into... nowhere in particular, she produced a set of books and slapped them down on the sand. “We&#039;ve got a couple of days before we need to be anywhere in particular, so we can get you properly accustomed to the situation.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t understand,” Silver said weakly.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry, you will.” Twilight&#039;s metal mouth creaked in what was probably a smile. “Oh, you might have heard us mentioning loop memories before? Try to let them do the thinking for your first time, it&#039;ll be easier.”</p><p class="double">Silver gulped, and tried to remember them talking about that. It was... strange.</p><p class="double">There were her <i>real</i> memories, the ones she was used to having, with her family and her friends in Equestria... and the strange, still-new experience of time looping.</p><p class="double">And then there was a whole new set of memories. Where she was a young filly, learning the ways of Alchemy, and...</p><p class="double">She gasped, looking down at her numb-feeling legs. As she&#039;d abruptly realized, they were artificial.</p><p class="double">Then she looked at Twilight. “Are... are we sisters? Here, I mean?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right.” Twilight nodded. “I&#039;m actually the younger sister, or supposed to be. And...” she stopped. “I&#039;m sorry, by the way. It looks like the script took your mother as the template instead of mine.”</p><p class="double">Tears started in Silver&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">“I know this must all be overwhelming,” Twilight said gently. “Some Anchors wouldn&#039;t be pleasant, it&#039;s true – they&#039;re from worlds less nice than Equestria, and their attitude to others can be a bit sink-or-swim. But I promise you, I&#039;ll only stand back unless you <i>want</i> my help. The moment you say so, this becomes about keeping you safe.”</p><p class="double">Silver sniffed. “Thanks. I&#039;ll...” she paused, and remembered that conversation with Gilda.</p><p class="double"><i>Let me guess, you feel like your buddy left you behind?</i></p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll give it a go.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the spirit.” Twilight nodded to her. “Again, though, if you need help then just ask.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You must be the Silver Alchemist!” a hassled-looking unicorn said to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “No, I&#039;m her sister. That&#039;s the Silver Alchemist.”</p><p class="double">“What am I, invisible or something?” Silver grumbled.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I didn&#039;t see you down there, squirt,” the unicorn apologized.</p><p class="double">Silver exhaled hard. “Is the short jokes thing going to <i>keep</i> happening?”</p><p class="double">“All signs point to yes, I&#039;m afraid,” Twilight said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right.” Silver winced at the damage to her remaining foreleg, which was coming close to laming her, and let the increasingly familiar local experiences help her ride out the pain. “Twilight? Quick question?”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“Just so I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve got this whole thing worked out, &#039;cause I&#039;m <i>totally</i> confused... that&#039;s a bad guy, right?” She pointed at the approaching form of Fuhrer King Bradley. (He actually looked a lot like Sombra.)</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“Right,” Silver repeated. “Thanks for the science lessons, by the way.” She lifted her forehooves and clapped them on the ground, making a quick Alchemical circle.</p><p class="double">A pair of silver rods appeared next to one another on the long slope towards ground level, growing out of the ground.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d you get the silver?” Twilight asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“This palace had coins in it,” Silver said by way of explanation. “Emphasis on <i>had.</i>” A gold lozenge extruded from the ground next to her. “Okay, here we go.”</p><p class="double">She lifted the lozenge bodily onto the upper end of the pair of rods, then clapped her hooves on the ground again just as King Bradley reached the base of the ramp.</p><p class="double">Electricity sparked, the air tore, and when the sound died away there was a huge crater field at the base of the ramp.</p><p class="double">Of King Bradley there was no sign.</p><p class="double">Silver&#039;s smile was surprisingly feral. “Take that!”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Cool. Railgun, eh?”</p><p class="double">“Yep. It split into lots of bits as it left the rails, so he couldn&#039;t dodge.” Silver blushed slightly. “I may have paid a little more attention to the lessons about silver, and I remembered the thing about it having great conductivity-”</p><p class="double">“The best,” Twilight agreed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Father slammed Silver into the ground, making her head spin, and then smashed her artificial foreleg.</p><p class="double">Silver focused woozily, and realized what was going on. Hohenheim was about to sacrifice herself, and she didn&#039;t have an option of how to get out...</p><p class="double">“Twilight?” she croaked. “Now, please.”</p><p class="double">A bolt of lambent force the size of a tree hit Father and sent him slamming against the far wall.</p><p class="double">“Good work, by the way,” Twilight whispered, helping her up. “You made it as far as the original did.”</p><p class="double">“I feel so special.” Silver winced, moving her stump. “Ow, that does <i>not</i> feel right...”</p><p class="double">Twilight faced Father, her Device building up another spell. “I&#039;ll handle him from now on. You&#039;ve done enough. More than enough.”</p><p class="double">Silver smiled weakly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.6</p><p class="double">Gilda looked down at the filly. “You seriously want to do the gryphon way? Now?”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Silver said, looking a little nervous. “But, just so you know, I&#039;m expecting you to tie both your forelegs behind your back and wire your beak shut first. I&#039;m not stupid.”</p><p class="double">“Heh.” Gilda paced in a slow circle around Silver, taking in the change in posture. “Looks like you&#039;re living up to that cutie mark after all.”</p><p class="double">Silver blinked, thrown. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Look, if there&#039;s one thing the loops teach you ponies, it&#039;s that those tattoos you have on your butts are seriously hard to interpret. So, a silver spoon.” Gilda tapped the underside of her beak. “First meaning: you were born into money and privilege. Second meaning: It&#039;s still the most mundane of eating utensils, everyone uses them, so even if yours is silver it&#039;s just a more valuable version of a normal kind of thing. Third meaning: there&#039;s a heart in the design, so you do have a good heart in there. Fourth meaning: silver is antiseptic, so it cures illnesses. Fifth meaning: silver tarnishes, but yours is mirror-bright – so you keep yourself in shape.”</p><p class="double">The gryphon scratched. “So, yeah. There&#039;s probably more, but that&#039;s enough to be getting on with.”</p><p class="double">Silver nodded. “I see. I think.”</p><p class="double">Gilda cricked her neck. “Now, where&#039;s that rope...”</p><p class="double">Seeing Silver looking apprehensive, she grinned. “No getting out of it now. You <i>did</i> say. So, come on already! I&#039;m looking forward to a good fight!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, something&#039;s funky this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up from her book. &quot;Oh hello Nyx!&quot; She stepped over to her daughter and winced slightly, pulling various branches and leaves out of her mane. &quot;Um...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I Awoke in the Everfree.&quot; The filly shivered, old memories surfacing for a moment before she got a hold of herself. &quot;Apparently I&#039;d been hovering around the castle for the past thousand years... and Luna&#039;s not there! I don&#039;t understand...&quot;</p><p class="double">Her mother finished up with her mane and moved on to the collection of tangled knots in her tail. &quot;Hmmm. I wonder....&quot; She cast a scrying spell, looking up at the moon. &quot;Oh. Ooooooh. Yeah, you&#039;re not replacing Nightmare Moon this time round. You&#039;re the Shadow Pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The... what now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A fragment of Nightmare Moon that wasn&#039;t banished.&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Local Ponyville myth, but the nonlooping AJ certainly believes it... even though she never bothered to tell me before the whole Tree of Harmony thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx snorted. &quot;Fragment of Nightmare Moon. That&#039;s real original.&quot; She tilted her head. &quot;Hey, does this mean that Luna&#039;s still going to be Nightmare Moon at the celebration?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Far as I can tell... Ah. All clean.&quot; The librarian smiled slyly. &quot;You have an idea, don&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;THE NIGHT!

I have been working for a thousand years to get these ponies to stay up and watch the stars, to enjoy the night as much as the day <i>if not more so,</i> to give those few who enjoyed the sky without a sun equal footing with Celestia&#039;s lapdogs, and you!&quot; She shot up, shoving her face into that of her larger counterpart. &quot;You want to waltz right in and claim it as your own! Up with this, I shall not put!&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked, completely stunned at this new development. &quot;I...&quot; She blinked again, shaking her head and glaring back at the filly with equal rage. &quot;Foal that you are! <i>I</i> am the true princess of the night, and you are nothing more then some... upstart! Can you lay claim to the moon? Nay! Tis mine, and no power shall wrest it from me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Power?&quot; The filly snorted, landing on the balcony&#039;s railing. &quot;Oh I see. <i>Power.</i> Just because you&#039;re bigger then me and have more magic, you get to boss me around is that it?! Never mind that you did absolutely NOTHING when you were trapped on your precious rock while poor little Shadow Pony-&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a distinctly southern gasp from somewhere in the crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;-worked <i>hoof and feather and horn</i> just to be heard, let alone create interest in astronomy, or make the night home to romance, or give ponies a place to party after the sun had set!&quot; The filly whirled on the flabbergasted Nightmare Moon. &quot;Noooooo, all that blood, sweat, and tears are <i>nothing</i> compared to just having enough blind strength to bully your way into anything!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...there are places...&quot; The mare bit her lips. &quot;...There are places where ponies celebrate while the moon is raised?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What, you haven&#039;t heard of night clubs?&quot; The Shadow Pony rolled her eyes. &quot;No, right, locked up for a thousand years. Yeah, there are.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon glanced at the crowd of ponies, noting that they no longer cowered in fear but instead peered on in interest. &quot;...We suppose We may have been hasty in forcing our claim. We will grant thou the moon, IF!&quot; she quickly added. &quot;If thou canst defeat us at some form of challenge.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm.&quot; The Shadow Pony considered the offer. &quot;...There is a form of duel often practiced in Night Clubs which would make us... fairly even. Would you agree to that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As long as it was explained to Us beforehoof.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Agreed.&quot; The filly smirked and whipped out a pair of sunglasses, snapping them onto her face. &quot;Rap battle it is then. You!&quot; She pointed to a white unicorn with an electric blue mane. &quot;You&#039;ve got thirty minutes to catch Big Black here up to speed.

With the poor, shrivelled apples (what!?) in sight, she could see two tiny fang-holes punctured into Applejack&#039;s hide on both sides, which still dripped with cider. &quot;Whatever it was sucked the juice right outta mah cutie mark!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, so whatever it is is Pinkie-Rational. Right.&quot; A disturbing thought danced across Twilight&#039;s mind. &quot;And Dash likes to joke about how she replaced her blood with Zap Apple Cider a couple of thousand loops ago.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s eyes widened with a speed rivalling the ejecta shell of a supernova as her pupils constricted to pinprick singularities of horrified realization. &quot;Whatever got mah cutie marks is gonna get her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s- what the chlorophyll is that noise?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; An almighty crash rocked the library as Dash plowed through an upstairs window at roughly the speed of sound and proceed to halfway embed herself in the floor. &quot;You guys have to help me! She vants to suck my blood!&quot;</p><p class="double">Tiny scrabbles of hooves clip-clattered against the upstairs balcony disturbingly lightly as the light coming through the window was filtered through a pair of yellow membranes. Silhouetted against the rising sun, the figure was partially shrouded by her own shadow as Twilight squinted into the light. The gleam of a pair of fangs glistened within a salivating maw beneath a pair of dully glowing blue eyes. Fluffy ears twitched at the strangled noises of inarticulate frustration coming from Twilight as her horn glowed with arcane energy.</p><p class="double">Then the sun was forcibly moved through the skies as Twilight ascended herself, revealing Fluttershy standing there with a disturbingly familiar new set of favoured mutations.</p><p class="double">Having the graces to look ashamed of herself, Fluttershy squeakily smiled as she folded her leathery wings and hopped down to the ground floor. Her breath hitched as she saw how Dash had buried herself in the floor. &quot;Oh! Oh my goodness! Oh, Rainbow Dash, are you alright!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Waaaaaaaaugh! Don&#039;t let her suck my blood! I don&#039;t wanna hang upside down and speak in a Roamanian accent!&quot; Dash thrashed as she tried to dig through the floorboards the rest of the way and make for the planet&#039;s core.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Dashie...&quot; Fluttershy caressed Dash&#039;s wings and sides with a hoof as she started to pull her free. Saliva dripped from her fangs as she nuzzled Dash disturbingly. &quot;I only want to show you how much I&#039;ve learned about the glories of freshly squeezed cider.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy, this has gone on long enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What Ah said!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy let go of Dash, leaving her stuck in the floor. &quot;Oh, whatever do you mean, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Intervention!&quot; Twilight&#039;s magic aura grabbed Fluttershy, bodily lifting her from the ground and carting her through the air to the door. &quot;And I know just who to do it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack started to follow Fluttershy and Twilight, stopping at the door as an urge struck her. She turned back to Dash, who was still wriggling in place, perfectly helpless and juicy.... &quot;Why Dash, Ah never thought Ah&#039;d get a chance like this...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AJ? Could you get Twilight to get me out of here? I really don&#039;t want to ascend and all just to get out of her floor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight ain&#039;t here no more, mah little Zap Apple...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh oh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fer that matter, neither is Applejack. Call me...&quot; Two fangs slid into place in Applejack&#039;s mouth, dripping as they considered the mobile Zap Apple before her. &quot;Applejuicer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m outta here.&quot; Dash ascended in a flash of light, teleporting herself screaming to where the Crystal Empire would show up in a year or two.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, sucks. Me and mah big mouth.&quot; Applejack frowned as she pondered it over. That Fluttershy out of all the ponies in the world had come up with a crazy idea for a prank was certainly an odd one. She bunched her hindquarters as she felt the painful tingles from the bites still. Her druidic friend had developed a ritual to pass along her whole &#039;Vampire of the Fruits&#039; nature for a loop – some adaptation of a family of spells about &#039;bite of the were-something&#039; – but she was starting to wonder if the shy gal had a kinky side to her. Did she really have to bite both of her cutie marks?</p><p class="double">Applejack shook her head, feeling funny as her ears popped into their temporary new forms and as her cutie mark temporarily morphed into a trio of apple-colored bats. &quot;Ah am NEVER saying &#039;bite me&#039; around that gal again. Whoooiiee! Well, time tae scare the cotton candy outta Pinkie and the magic outta Twilight.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Zo, mein Flootersny, vy do you feel ze need to grow bat vings and suck blued froom epples?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy raised an eyebrow at her psychologist. &quot;Pinkie... when exactly did you find time to get a degree in therapy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Non non non!&quot; The pink pony bopped her friend&#039;s nose with her note-teking pencil. &quot;Zis iz not avout me und <i>my</i> needs. Zis iz avout <i>you.</i>&quot; She twitched her big bushy mustache and peered over her thick-rimmed glasses. &quot;Now zen... vy?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus sighed, leaning back into the couch. &quot;Well... I suppose it all comes back to kindness really. See, it&#039;s easy to be polite, and generosity is... something that&#039;s fairly simple to teach. But with kindness, you have to have empathy. You have to understand the person you&#039;re being kind to, help them on... something like their level. So... I guess I sometimes get carried away in understanding and let myself become.... other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. Und ze bat zing, zat started as un kindness and vecame.... addiction?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...maybe just a tad,&quot; Fluttershy admitted. &quot;I guess I&#039;ll try to hold back a bit... from now on. But seriously, Pinkie, how did you get a therapy degree?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie merely smiled. &quot;Let me have zome mystory, Flootersny.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.12 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight lay in a sunny clearing in… oh, some forest. It was another Oerth Loop, but the adventuring races were the setting&#039;s usual humanoids, and she wasn&#039;t one of them. Instead, she was a local unicorn: leonine tail, cloven hooves, the whole package. Oh, and none of the trappings of civilization whatsoever.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t so bad. With the perspective of a Loop Anchor, Twilight saw it as something like a camping trip. In any case, she had more than enough stored in her subspace pocket to keep herself entertained for years, from books to experiments to supplies for making magical items. And she could always find a party of adventurers to tag along with should the mood strike her. This was Oerth, after all; they were everywhere.</p><p class="double">She was scribing a scroll for what this world&#039;s mages would probably call <i>transmute into orange</i> when the sound of wingbeats came from above. Twilight looked up, tried to shade her eyes with a forehoof, and winced as her anatomy reminded her that it wasn&#039;t nearly as flexible as normal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Twi! These bodies kinda suck.&quot;</p><p class="double">The voice settled the matters of what and who. &quot;It&#039;s okay, Dash.&quot; Twilight stood as her friend shed altitude. &quot;What&#039;s up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash sighed as she descended. &quot;What, aside from these dumb horse bodies and us being the only ponies in the Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s certainly a novel experience, Rainbow, and you know how hard those are to come by. You should try to enjoy it and is that an egg?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s why I came.&quot; Dash did in fact have a roughly watermelon-sized egg cradled in her front legs, its shell just as blue. She set it down on the ground with surprising care. &quot;I, uh, I kinda…&quot; She trailed off into inaudible, almost Fluttershy-esque muttering.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s mind had already formed a hypothesis. She pulled a PADD out of subspace, grabbed it with telekinesis, and called up the 3.5 <i>Monster Manual</i>. She confirmed her guess in moments, and immediately wished that she hadn&#039;t. &quot;Mother of mahogany. You—&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash sneered. &quot;Yeah. Like I said, these bodies suck. I didn&#039;t even do anything!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s unfertilized?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am so glad it&#039;s just you and me this Loop. Can we please keep this between us? Pinkie, Gilda, Rarity, none of &#039;em would ever let me live this down. And I do <i>not</i> want to try and explain this to Scootaloo.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, Dash.&quot; Twilight retrieved some bubble wrap, wrapped the egg, and whisked it into her subspace pocket. She&#039;d put more thorough protections on it after the visit. &quot;Your secret is safe with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash sagged with relief. &quot;Thanks, Twi. You&#039;re a real pal. And, uh… take care of it, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course.&quot; Twilight silently scrapped the more invasive experiments that could be performed on a single cell of that size. Well, unless she acquired other pegasus eggs. Surely her friend wasn&#039;t the only member of the species that laid infertile eggs. The same environmental triggers would have applied to all local populations…</p><p class="double">&quot;Wish I could just ascend,&quot; Dash sighed. &quot;That&#039;d probably take care of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">That shook Twilight out of her thoughts of specimen acquisition. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, Rainbow, but we&#039;ve been over this. We don&#039;t know how the local gods would react. They might see it as a challenge.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But that&#039;s a bunch of horseapples!&quot; Dash flared her wings. &quot;We&#039;re not <i>that</i> powerful, and it&#039;s not like I&#039;m gonna grab the sun or moon or anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight couldn&#039;t really shrug, so she tossed her mane. &quot;Well, find a cleric and take it up with them.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus glared and pawed at the sod. &quot;Maybe I will. I am <i>not</i> forcing another one of those monstrosities out of me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, that isn&#039;t what I—&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash flapped off. &quot;Thanks again, Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn groaned. &quot;Why do I even speak?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.13 (Grinnerz)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“- and I must reiterate, the sandwich was clearly labelled with my name. And, furthermore… Oh, I do hate it when the loop ends mid-conversation.”</p><p class="double">Looking around her, Luna saw grey dust and rock. A quick glance upward confirmed that she was on the moon staring down at Equestria below. Checking the strength of the seal upon her prison revealed she had a few hours left before release.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm.” What to do? Write messages in the stars? No. Come bearing tidings of interplanetary goodwill? Another time. A comedy routine? Already done. Arrive already purified? Perhaps.” And perhaps I should try to find what sister sees in that little hobby of hers.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia stood within her quarters attempting to prepare herself for the battle to come. To fight her younger sister was not something Celestia was looking forward to, yet for the safety of their subjects it must be done. Even should she fall, Twilight would… Twilight <i>must</i> find the Elements.</p><p class="double">Even as the sun princess thought on things to come, she felt the seal break. Time had run out.</p><p class="double">Royal Guardsponies called out from the castle walls as something appeared out from the light of the moon. Though to Celestia’s ears they were less fearful and more… disbelieving? Turning towards the balcony, she caught sight of what had so surprised the watch.</p><p class="double">“<b>Cowabunga!</b>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Is that a surfboard?” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.14 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked toward her five friends over the pile of books and papers they&#039;d been working on. All six of them were Alicorns - it only seemed appropriate for the kind of game they were planning.</p><p class="double">&quot;So we&#039;re agreed on the rules?&quot; she asked.</p><p class="double">She got four nods and one excited bounce.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay. Now we just need to make the map and the pieces, and we can start playing!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Sister, what do you make of this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia took the paper Luna handed her via telekinesis and studied it.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Somepony is painting large lines over parts of Equestria?&quot; Celestia said, &quot;And...the Griffin Lands...and everywhere else?&quot;</p><p class="double">There were pictures with the reports, showing a suspiciously familiar pink blur wielding a comically oversized paintbrush and bucket of paint.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Right, this rock looks good,&quot; Applejack said, looking over a nice reddish mountain not far from Appleloosa.</p><p class="double">Looking a little like she was tap-dancing, Applejack bent a large chunk out and methodically shaped it until it resembled one of the Royal Guards. There were a few differences, like the funny plume on top of the statue&#039;s head, the apple motif on the armor, and the being made of solid rock thing. It was also the size of Town Hall in Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;One down, thirty-sommat to go...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, um...three of my armies in the Everfree Forest would like to attack your armies of Canterlot...if you don&#039;t mind,&quot; Fluttershy said, holding up three red dice.</p><p class="double">Rarity beamed, lifting up two white dice. &quot;Bring. It. On!&quot;</p><p class="double">The denizens of Canterlot watched in awe as the distant forms of three giant pony soldiers made of trees and two giant pony soldiers made of ice (and wearing fabulous capes of solidified water) did battle over the giant line of paint that had appeared the other day.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, we don&#039;t even HAVE an Australia, how did you even do that?!&quot; Rainbow Dash groaned as the party pony&#039;s giant candy-cane wielding marshmallow soldiers rampaged all over her own giant thunderbolt-using cloud armies from out of nowhere.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dashie, hiding in Australia until you steamroll the competition is TRADITION! Silly!&quot; Pinkie Pie giggled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Five!&quot; Applejack declared triumphantly.</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed to her die.</p><p class="double">&quot;Six...oh, crabapples. That&#039;s my last army.&quot;</p><p class="double">A mile away, the last of Applejack&#039;s stone soldiers crumbled as Twilight&#039;s magical construct soldier blasted it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hooray! Now it&#039;s between me, Twilight, and Rarity!&quot; Pinkie exclaimed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The rest of the Mane Six watched politely as Rarity was crowned Queen of the World by a very confused Celestia and Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;know, that was pretty fun,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, &quot;Whose turn is it to pick the next board game?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mine,&quot; Applejack said, looking over their list of games and crossing &#039;Risk&#039; off it, &quot;Let&#039;s see, what&#039;s left...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.15 (Detective Ethan Redfield):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>The Great Equestrian Foam Sword War, Part 2</b></p><p class="double">Gray wisps of smoke escaped the train as it ejected the travellers from Ponyville into Canterlot. Mayor Mare stared at the golden towers that rose into the air, a strange mix of joy and relief filled her heart at seeing the heart of Equestria once again. Even with the sun below the mountains, magical beacons and candlelight made the city gleam like the sun. The next couple days would hold numerous shopping trips and dining like the princesses at some of their finest restaurants as the Mayor and her friends and family arrived. Then, they would board a dirigible for a trip around the world in 90 days. These travel plans swirled through the Mayor&#039;s head as she made her way to a well kept but modest hotel. Celestia and Luna spent the previous day giving suggestions about where to travel and what to do abroad. It was the vacation of a lifetime and anyone would be excited.</p><p class="double">Looking at her now, though, no one could tell she was excited, as she looked from her room window to where Ponyville rested a few hours away. Although new to the loops, she had spent about twenty loops as Mayor of Ponyville, one in Metropolis and one in Townsville. She couldn&#039;t even remember her last vacation, worried as she was that without her there, her town/city would fall into ruin. But with Twilight&#039;s promise to protect Ponyville, she knew everything would turn out alright.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Big Mac&#039;s Bar</b></p><p class="double">&quot;So...how many of Miss Lulamoon&#039;s laboratories has she gone through tryin&#039; to make a foam sword grenade,&quot; Big Mac asked as he slid another cup of cider her way. With a single slurp, the cider was gone instantly. Twilight slammed her head down and muttered through the counter. Mac tilted his head and said, &quot;Sorry, Miss Sparkle, I could&#039;a sworn you said five.&quot;</p><p class="double">The element of magic nodded her head. The Anchor had decided to sit the war out, determined to make sure Ponyville was standing when the Mayor returned. She resolved to keep a close eye on Trixie in the month leading up to the war.</p><p class="double">Several seconds of silence passed as Mac looked over Trixie&#039;s scroll again, &quot;Say, did ya&#039; even agree ta&#039; the terms a&#039; this competition?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight lifted her head up, &quot;She pinkie promised that if I followed through with its terms, She&#039;d never use explosives of any kind for the next ten loops we&#039;re together in. I&#039;m curious to see how long she lasts.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac chuckled to himself. He held no interest in the war beyond keeping everypony safe. Applebloom and all the crusaders, however, were back at the farm setting up a new geofront running from the furthest corner of Ponyville to the edge of Everfree.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Sweet Apple Acre&#039;s Geofront</b></p><p class="double">Applebloom brought down the lever as several pieces of high tech machinery whirled around her. The sound of several high caliber rounds being fired over at the firing range echoed across the geofront. She looked to where Sweetie Belle was testing weapons modifications, &quot;How are the runes coming for the .408 cal rounds?&quot;</p><p class="double">Another crack echoed down the massive Geofront accompanied by a burst of white light. Her radio squawked back, &quot;It&#039;s working. I&#039;ve tested several magazines already, no errors. We&#039;ll need to have Twilight inspect them first, but it should prove effective from a great distance. Should work with the missiles and other caliber rounds as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom nodded to herself as new plans formed in her head. She&#039;d have Twilight check her design, then a prototype machine that churned out thousands of rounds and foam swords, and then if testing works, we can shift into mass production. With that set up, she made for Nyx and Scoots&#039; project. They probably had all kinds of modifications she wanted to make to their vehicles, which would consume quite a bit of her other time. After that, she would have to work on her own last resort project.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">What he heard, though, weren&#039;t terms he had heard in the equestrian military, but they still sounded something out of a strategy meeting during his times in the army. Their loops in futuristic and human militaries lead to terms like &quot;fixed weapon emplacements&quot; and &quot;long distance firing positions&quot; being passed around in anticipation of the &#039;war&#039; ahead. He resolved to take them on a vacation loop after the &#039;war&#039; ended.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what have ya heard from the other loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight lifted his head, &quot;Rainbow is practising some high speed fight manoeuvres over the ocean-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Somewhere over the Ocean</b></p><p class="double">A flash of rainbow split the ocean. A moment later, a glowing rainbow maned pony appeared over land on one side of the watery expanse. She looked down at the stopwatch in her hand. Ten seconds to cross the ocean. &#039;I can be faster than this,&#039; She thought to herself and disappeared with a rainbow explosion of energy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Gilda, upon learning about the competition, returned to the Griffin Empire to make preparations of some sort-&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>The Capital of the Griffon Empire</b></p><p class="double">The Ebony Palace standing at the top of the deepest canyon on the planet was home to the mighty griffon emperor, Aepnet. At its centre, the iron throne rested at the top of several stairs. One female griffon stood at the bottom of the stairs, surrounded by two squads of ten griffon soldiers that lay bleeding on the ground. The emperor and his aides resided at the top, looking down upon Gilda as she ascended the stairs, &quot;Emperor Aepnet, by right of succession, I, Gilda Grizelda, daughter of Dutchess Tyra Grizelda and 17th in line to the imperial throne, have come to end your reign and establish myself as Emperess of the Griffon Empire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Aepnet was no amateur though. He gazed upon her, noting a confidence he had never seen in his niece before, &quot;As honour dictates, I must accept, but implore you to back down. This will be to the death. Or has your time amongst the ponies at your flight camp made you weak?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda lifted her claw, steeling her emotions, &quot;No. A wise creature told me that only the truly strong can afford kindness, and I will make you submit before I have to kill you. Come at me, uncle!&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, the two griffons leapt at each other.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Lemon Rush is around this time, so Fluttershy&#039;s going to participate with him on a team-&quot;</p><p class="double">The sound of gears churning, wood crunching and ponies screaming could be heard from the basement of Sugarcube Corner where Mac had set up this time around to be more easily accessible to the loopers.</p><p class="double">Twilight buried her face in her hooves, &quot;Oh Chlorophyll, I think that&#039;s her now.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Ponyville</b></p><p class="double">The sound of severe rumbling could be heard throughout ponyville as ponies ran in terror of the approaching metal monster. The house sized tank slammed into Mayor Trixie&#039;s city hall, demolishing it in a spray of wood and glass. A butterscotch pegasus with a foam sword hung around her neck lifted her head out of the massive tank and looked over the destruction. She focused on several ponies running away, then shouted down to Lemon, &quot;Umm...could you drive us closer, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lemon looked up at his adopted mother, &quot;You want to hit them with your sword, Little Mother?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes widened in horror, &quot;What?! No! I just don&#039;t think they&#039;ll hear the sound of my apologies over the rumble of the engines from this far away!&quot;</p><p class="double">A pink light flashed as Pinkie appeared out of nowhere, &quot;Hey Fluttershy! Looks like you&#039;re having fun, but maybe a bit too much fun. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll take you somewhere where you can have all the fun you want!&quot;</p><p class="double">With another burst of pink light, the three ponies and the massive tank teleported into Everfree Forest.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After Twilight rebuilt City Hall, re-assured the non-looping ponies that the world wasn&#039;t coming to an end and got Lemon Rush and Fluttershy to promise never to use their tank in Ponyville for driving practice, she re-appeared in Mac&#039;s bar, seeming more dishevelled than before. Mac gestured for her to continue.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s about it. Rarity has locked herself in Carousel Boutique muttering something about magical artefact modifications. The only one else I&#039;ve heard from is my BBBFF. Shiny&#039;s going to use this to test some military formations he&#039;s developed over the loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">She chuckled to herself, &quot;Something interesting about this loop, apparently Shiny has a different Lieutenant this time around. His name&#039;s Candy Cane and his appearance has made all the difference in the guard. Their skills are shaper then he&#039;s ever seen and morale is high. He was the looper who came in yesterday evening with the black military hat, red bill shadowing his eyes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac chuckled, &quot;Didn&#039;t seem ta&#039; like you and Pinkie when y&#039;all tried introducin&#039; yourselves. Couldn&#039;t get away fast enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s ears flattened against her head, &quot;You think he saw one of my earlier pranks?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac shrugged, &quot;Who knows...but I&#039;m sure ya&#039;ll win him over sooner or later. You did me, after all. Have you seen any of the others?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. The rest are keeping low profiles. Celestia and Luna are setting up geofronts all over Equestria in preparing to evacuate a good portion of the country. I&#039;m not sure if they know things will get out of hand, or if they have something big planned.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gestured for another Cider and lifted it to her mouth before muttering, &quot;I hope it&#039;s the former.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.16 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, um....&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining gave Chrysalis an awkward glance as he finished choosing his new skills.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You and Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">The queen of changelings dropped out of the half-meditative state she was in, shrugging. &quot;It was a surprise for us as well... do you not approve?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not in any position to pass judgement over you two,&quot; Shining quickly explained. &quot;I&#039;m just... this is going to sound really bad, actually, so I want to be clear I&#039;m not accusing you of anything but--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am <i>not</i> just using her as a food source.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039;s clipped tone made Shining Armor wince. &quot;No, that&#039;s not what I was going to ask.

I mean... back when I was with, uh, the other you, I....&quot; She waved a hoof vaguely. &quot;I felt.... <i>equal.</i> Even. Focused on myself and... Trixie helps me to focus. To be, really. It&#039;s not exactly the same but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s close enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trust me, it is,&quot; Cadance stated with a smile. &quot;I&#039;ve been around you two long enough to know that.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen jumped. &quot;I thought you were still selecting skills!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, I just like to meditate sometimes. Easy way to spy on ponies, and from spying comes manipulations comes happy couples!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor bit his lip. &quot;I&#039;m not entirely sure that&#039;s ethical dear...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.17</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What. The buck. Is this.”</p><p class="double">Twilight prodded it, producing a kind of &#039;pfff&#039; sound.</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “I think it&#039;s a fluffy pony! I will call it Fluffle-”</p><p class="double">“No.” Twilight shook her head. “I&#039;m not getting involved. If this is a loop peculiarity, then you can handle it. Meanwhile, I&#039;ve got a project to do before Trixie next loops.”</p><p class="double">She gave Pinkie a pointed look. “That means that you don&#039;t use my main room as a lounge.”</p><p class="double">“Awww...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight gave Pinkie a glare. “Okay, explain.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know what went wrong!” Pinkie protested. “I thought maybe Chrysalis would like to meet Fluffle, and she... vanished into the fur.”</p><p class="double">“Do you mean the looping Chrysalis?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shook her head.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight rubbed her head. “I can feel a headache coming on. Okay, this is your fault, you solve this.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Pinkie... this is <i>not</i> solved.”</p><p class="double">“I like to think of it as solved,” Pinkie countered. “I mean, look! They love her!”</p><p class="double">“They&#039;re terrified half to death that she&#039;ll engulf them like she did Chrysalis.” Twilight pointed at the cringing Changelings surrounding the fluffy pony, who now had a makeshift crown glued to her head.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “Potaeto, potahto.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>47.18 (Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom got to Diamond Tiara during the lunch recess. Subtle ways of arranging their desks and other specific but not odd responses to Miss Cheerilee had signalled they both were Awake. Neither of the other future Crusaders were but another classmate was missing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Any sign of where Silver Spoon is?&quot; Applebloom asked. The pair had staged a mane pulling fight at the start of the school year, that seemed to &#039;settle differences&#039;, so nopony thought them eating lunch together too strange.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara shook her head, &quot;No. I managed a peek in the City Hall records. Her dad is there, but he left town. According to Twilight Sparkle he&#039;s got degrees in hippopology, archeology, and ancient Mesoponytamian Culture. Left for field work I guess. Her mom&#039;s here, but she&#039;s married someone else.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom sighed, &quot;It happens DT. You&#039;ll catch up to her someLoop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tiara snorted, &quot;If she&#039;s forgiven me by then Hayseed. It just hurt they way she looked at me when I explained the Loops to her, you know?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom hoofed over one of her apple turnovers. Granny was always big on comfort food for ponies with the blues. &quot;Not really, but I&#039;ll be sure to ask if Babs starts Looping.&quot; Something by the schoolhouse steps caught her eye. A pony so tall Miss Cheerliee was on the top while the newcomer was on the ground, and still was over her head. &quot;Is she Saddle Arabian?&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond perked up, &quot;Yes. This is interesting. Maybe a guest for class?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom shrugged as she saw Miss Cheerliee tug the rope for the school bell. &quot;Guess we&#039;ll find out soon enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">As soon as the class shuffled in, Miss Cheerliee poked her head out of the door to speak to somepony. &quot;Class, we are getting a new student today. Come in and introduce yourself dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pony that came in was nearly as tall as Miss Cheerliee herself, and most of that height in the legs. She had a patterned Saddle Arabian poll cap, along with a matching blanket on her back and sash running from her withers around to her chest. It was the coat colour and the familiar spoon cutiemark that caused Diamond Tiara&#039;s heart to skip.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, my name, well would be Silver Spoon in Equestrian. Let&#039;s just go with that to avoid mangling it please?&quot; A sea of waving hooves, all but Appleblooms and Diamond Tiara&#039;s suddenly sprung up and the tall filly sighed. &quot;Let me guess,&quot; She started pointing at random and sprouting out answers before anypony could speak. &quot;Yes I am about your age, I just got Mother&#039;s height. Mother insisted I dress up for my first day. The Veil dance is a bunch of road apples made up by a randy stallion, so no I don&#039;t know it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerliee stepped in to bring the class under control. &quot;I&#039;m sure you can ask her, after class. Respectfully.&quot; She gave a baleful glare, and Fluttershy had been giving her lessons. Still not a patch on the pegasus, but good enough for now. &quot;There is an empty desk over by Applebloom and Diamond Tiara. The two that didn&#039;t swamp you in questions right out of the gate.&quot; She gave the class another look. &quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll make friends soon enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver nodded. &quot;As we say in The Sands. There are no strangers, merely old friends who have yet to meet again.&quot; Diamond Tiara&#039;s heart stopped, Silver Spoon was looking right at her as she said that.</p><p class="double">A problem rapidly became apparent however. Miss Cheerliee looked dismayed at the mismatch of a filly the size of most grown mares trying to fit into one of her desks. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;ll see about getting one you can fit into.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon pulled out a piece of cloth wrapped chalk from under her blanket. &quot;I can handle this.&quot; Before anypony could ask, or stop her she rapidly drew a strangely inscribed circle on the seat, then pressed her forehooves to it. With a flash of light the chair morphed, stretching out and up. The result was larger, but lighter looking and Silver Spoon settled into it. &quot;I can change it back after class if you like?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee reigned in her boggling and shook her head. &quot;If it is a stable change the end of the year will be fine.&quot; At the filly&#039;s nod she turned back to her lesson plan, trying to pull the gawking colt&#039;s and filly&#039;s attention back to the blackboard. She made a mental note to ask Twilight Sparkle to look at the magic, just to be certain. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The end of school saw the usual crush of foals let free rushing the door. But instead of rushing to individual destinations there was a clustering around a particularly tall and leggy member of their herd. Diamond Tiara and Applebloom shared a look and started helping her cut out as she fielded questions.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, come on! Give her some room. Not like she&#039;s gonna run off tomorrow!&quot; Applebloom found it a lot like herding dealing with her Unawake classmates.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right you lot! Let her breathe. I&#039;m sure you can talk to her some more at Pinkie Pie&#039;s party!&quot; Diamond Tiara was less physical, but just as intimidating.</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon started. &quot;She&#039;s throwing me a party?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded, &quot;Of course. Pinkie Pie&#039;s Awake, so she has to be plotting to throw you a party!&quot; Her classmates nodded, a given of Ponyville life, completely missing the emphasis.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked at Applebloom as their classmates finally started breaking up a bit. &quot;Sugar Cube Corner?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded, &quot;Sugar Cube Corner. Come on Silver Spoon, we&#039;ll show you the way. Otherwise we might wind up Looping looking for you while you try to get there.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon nodded, and they managed to get through town to the Corner with relatively few interruptions. Though she was having issues adjusting to most adults being at eye level for her.</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon found herself seated in the &#039;Diplomatic Corner Booth&#039; with a costumed Pinkie walking guard as the three shared a &#039;Chocolate Boat to Tartarus&#039; Sundae. A dish that seems big enough to save a filly from a flood. Well excepting Spoon&#039;s current form. She hesitantly tested the waters. &quot;So, who is Awake now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom spoke up first, &quot;Well us three. None of the other Crusaders, and no Nyx so that&#039;s it for our age. Looks like just Pinkie and Twilight of course from the Bearers. Don&#039;t know if the Princesses are Awake or not.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked at her one time friend. &quot;So, um. How is this loop treating you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver shrugged. &quot;Being half Saddle Arabian isn&#039;t the weirdest one yet. At least this time I have enough Equestrian to keep my Cutie Mark. Being Gilda&#039;s niece was definitely weird though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked confused, &quot;How does a pony get to be a griffin&#039;s niece?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver smirked back, &quot;Who says I was a pony that time? It&#039;s weird, I seem to spend as much time as something else as a Pony, or at least pony like.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three paused to digest that, and consume more of the Boat. Diamond Tiara moved next, &quot;So was one of those &#039;other&#039; times where you learned whatever you did with the desk?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver shook her head. &quot;No, I was pure pony for that Fused Loop. Well excepting two metal legs, thank Celestia I Awoke after losing them. Hooking up replacements was bad enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked uncomfortable, &quot;err Silver? The Princesses kinda asked we Loopers not swear by them. We try to use trees instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver looked at the farm filly strangely. &quot;really? I wondered why you guys did that.&quot; She caught Diamond Tiara&#039;s nod and shrugged. &quot;Anyway, what I did was a method of rearranging matter. The particular &#039;school&#039; I used there was called Alkhestry. It fits better in Equestria than its cousin, Alchemy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked at Diamond Tiara then sighed. Looks like she&#039;d have to be the &#039;heavy&#039; this time. DT was apparently worried about hurting her friendship even worse. &quot;Are you sure you want to blow your cover this early in the loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon smiled. &quot;What, with Alkhestry? How much do you know about Saddle Arabia and it&#039;s magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara got it first, and giggled. &quot;So you figure to pass it off as some exotic magic from Saddle Arabia?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon nodded, and tapped her flank. &quot;I apparently got this helping Daddy on a dig. Finding and restoring lost knowledge of how ponies used to live their lives. And we just discovered,&quot; Silver Spoon waved her forehooves in the air,</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara wound up chorusing with her &quot;Lost secrets of Saddle Arabian Magic!&quot; Both fillies stopped in embarrassment.</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked at one then the other as the awkward moment stretched. &quot;well I need the little fillies room. Don&#039;t eat this all while ah&#039;m gone!&quot; She trotted off.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked at her friend? &quot;Er, Silver? Are we?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon&#039;s gaze seemed to pass over her. &quot;The Fused loop I was in was a place called Amestris. It could be a rather nasty place, particularly the stuff the people me and Twilight were replacing had to deal with. But it taught me a lot about what you will do for families, and friends. So, I think I&#039;m getting there.&quot; The taller filly shrugged, &quot;Having the Princess of Friendship be your &#039;little sister&#039; probably helps.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon transmuted the surface of the table to block the epic spit take that comment got out of Diamond Tiara. </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='50'></a><h3>Loops 48</h3>
<p>48.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo Awoke looking through a grating. A quick self inspection first conformed she had hands, but wasn&#039;t human, a pony-anthro? No, a <i>pegasus</i> anthro, though her wings were hidden under a shapeless green sweater. Down below a red wolf in a fancy braided jacket was going on in fractured common to a bunch of other dogs in various forms of scruffy gear about how rich the box sitting on the table in front of him was going to make him. Then the loop memories hit. Air pirates, the mouthy mexicano moron was one Don Karnage, and she was currently in an air vent on a pirate airship called the Iron Vulture. Awesome!</p><p class="double">She was apparently one Scootaloo &#039;Scoots&#039; Skyscorcher, and a soon to be ex-pirate cabin-boy. She rifled the memories, orphanage, bullied as a freak, while this world had bird anthros with wing hands, pegasi didn&#039;t exist, runaway, hooked up with the air-pirates because she was mad about planes. She&#039;d managed to keep both wings and gender a secret from the bozos, which wasn&#039;t hard as apart from Karnage the entire bunch had more toes than brain cells. She&#039;d been with them a year, gotten fed up a lot sooner, and wanted out.</p><p class="double">Which led to her current situation. This was apparently Don Karnage&#039;s biggest score, stolen from some big wig industrialist by the name of Sher Khan, and she intended to steal it and set out on her own, acquiring a plane and licence as soon as she was of age. As plans went, it was kind of shy on the fine detail, but then she was only twelve years old. Scootaloo decided to go with it, she certainly didn&#039;t know enough about the world to start making her own plans yet.</p><p class="double">She opened the grating and dropped down onto the table beside the box. “Wow! That really is a neat treasure! No lesser pirate could have stolen it!”</p><p class="double">As she expected the egotistical canine preened, “Yes, of course, I am the fantabulous Don Karnage yes/no?”</p><p class="double">“Oh yes, and I wanted to thank you for teaching me how to lie, cheat and plunder. I guess you could call this my final exam...” She scooped up the box and sprung over his head, dropping the red bandanna that showed her pirate affiliation over his head. Using the head of the largest pirate, Dumptruck, as a stepping stone, she landed at the door and kept running. Thankfully this body had her regular lightning reflexes and acrobatic skill.</p><p class="double">“It was... wait what?” The pirate finally caught up and yelled, “Stop that boy!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo charged out of the control room and down metal gantries, yells and cries following her. She met some pirates on the way down and yelled, “Get up there and help the Captain, right away!”</p><p class="double">As they ran upstairs, she thanked Celestia for stupid villains. Dropping down to the floor of the main hangar deck, she snatched a grapnel launcher from the rack of blunderbusses along one wall and charged towards the open hangar door, shaped like a raptor&#039;s beak. Ignoring the yelling growing behind her, she charged up to the lip and dived off. She barely heard from above Don Karnage&#039;s voice yelling, “No, my treasure!”</p><p class="double">Plummeting from several thousand feet would be a concern for most people, even a pegasus whose stubby wings didn&#039;t allow her to fly. She had plenty of fixes in her sub-space pocket, but she decided to get some practice with her in-loop abilities. Her wings popped out of slits in her jumper and she angled her body to power dive towards a cloud, and plunged into it, arresting her fall. Her cloud-walking abilities were another secret she&#039;d managed to keep from the pirates.</p><p class="double">She popped her face out of the cloud to check the giant air-ship above her, which was already shedding single engined biplanes like a dog shedding fleas. Whatever else there was nothing wrong with their reactions when it didn&#039;t involve actual thought. They plunged after her, and she made sure none of them were headed right for her hiding spot before ducking back in. She tucked the box inside her jumper and made it secure.</p><p class="double">She let them dive past her and buzz around below as the cloud floated away from the search area. As she waited for them to drift out of sight, she directed a thought towards Pansy. <i>Any luck finding other loopers?</i></p><p class="double"><i>No-pony from our world, though they may simply be out of range. Locally, I don&#039;t have enough to work with yet. Clover&#039;s the real expert.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Don&#039;t do yourself down, I wouldn&#039;t trade you for a dozen Clovers. Keep trying.</i></p><p class="double">She got an impression of appreciation from Pansy, and the question, <i>So what&#039;s the mission plan?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Get to this Cape Suzette place where Sher Khan is, return his property, see what we can get out of it, if anything. After that, who knows, Ascend and age myself a couple of years then go after a plane and a pilot&#039;s license. From what I know, this world is practically built for pilots. Which means I could have a huge amount of fun here. If I don&#039;t find some kind of quest... this looks like the sort of world that&#039;ll have one, and I tick all the boxes for a starting out hero.</i></p><p class="double">The pirates had moved out of sight, and Scootaloo figured it was safe to move. She pushed her way down to the bottom of the cloud, and peeked out. Aha, a twin engined cargo job, just what she needed. She quickly fixed pads of clouds around her hooves, and power dived again, unslinging the grapple gun. A quick shot and a dash of weather magic wrapped the grapple around the leading edge of the rudder, and she swung her feet under her, pumping weather magic into them to act as flying skates. Her in-loop self didn&#039;t know how it worked, just that she could do it. Her wings could propel her as well, but not as fast as even a slow plane, and unlike her wings, a plane didn&#039;t get tired.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been careful to dive below the pilot&#039;s line of sight, as the last thing she wanted was for anyone to see her abilities. After about half an hour, they started descending towards a tropical island with some sort of resort that looked to be part tree-house, and partly built out of a wreck of an old galleon. Various wooden docks stuck out into the water at odd angles, with dozens of seaplanes of various makes and models moored at them. The big neon sign said &#039;Louie&#039;s&#039;. Now this looked like a fun place...</p><p class="double">She unhooked the grapple gun and let it drop, flying down under her own power, looking for a quiet spot to land. She found it on a beach a short way around from the main docks, and made a neat two point landing. Folding her wings back inside her jumper, she strolled around and climbed up the docks and to the main entrance. She could hear singing from inside, some guy going on about how he was &#039;gone&#039;. She slipped in the door to see filled tables and a big bear in a flight shirt and wearing a fruit salad on his head singing and dancing. However, he did seem to be looking towards the door and did a double-take as she entered.</p><p class="double">Noting it for future reference, she made her way over to the bar where an orangutan in a Hawaiian was mixing up some cocktail concoction. She bounded up onto a stool and waited for him to notice her.</p><p class="double">“Hey, short stuff, where&#039;d you spring from?”</p><p class="double">“Just flew in, but now I&#039;m here, and I&#039;d like a drink.” She pulled an Equestrian bit from her sub-space pocket. “I don&#039;t have local money, but I can pay.”</p><p class="double">The orangutan picked it up, weighing it in his hand, bit it and tapped it against the counter. “Well don&#039;t that beat all! Where&#039;d a little guy get something like this?”</p><p class="double">“Family heirloom.” Scootaloo shrugged. “So, it&#039;ll cover a drink and a meal?”</p><p class="double">“Cuz, if this is the real deal, you&#039;re covered for pretty much everything. Oh, hey Baloo, sounds like your pipes are all in tune.”</p><p class="double">“You know it Louie, heh... mind if I borrow your new friend for a minute?” The big bear was trying to sound relaxed and failing.</p><p class="double">“Not my call cuz.” He indicated the bear to Scootaloo, “This is Baloo, best pilot in the skies. He&#039;s good people. If you like planes, he&#039;s the guy to talk to. Tell you what, I&#039;ll make you one of my triple split specials. Finest sundae west of Timbucthree.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds great!” Scootaloo looked over at Baloo. “One for Baloo here as well?”</p><p class="double">“I never pass up free eats.” Baloo&#039;s voice was jovial, but still strained. He waited until Louie had moved away and said, “Who are you, and where&#039;s Kit?”</p><p class="double">“The name&#039;s Scootaloo Skyscorcher, and the only kit I&#039;ve got is what I&#039;m wearing. Let me guess, you&#039;re a looper, and I&#039;ve replaced someone called Kit who you were expecting instead.”</p><p class="double">“Hey yeah, but what&#039;s a looper... are you talking about the way things keep happening over and over?”</p><p class="double">“Oh horse-feathers, sounds like you&#039;re new to all this. How many times has it happened for you?”</p><p class="double">“About thirty, forty times, you know what&#039;s going on?”</p><p class="double">“Oh pony, looks like my turn to give the &#039;welcome to the multiverse&#039; speech.” She glanced around, and whispered, “Pansy, holo-projector and a perception filter please.”</p><p class="double">She proceeded to give him loops 101, complete with pretty pictures. Over the loops they&#039;d gotten it down to a fine art. As she put away the projector. “To sum up, looks like you&#039;re Anchor for this world, Kit will return next loop, and from how close you two are, he&#039;ll probably start looping soon too.”</p><p class="double">Baloo was shaking his head. “Kiddo, that&#039;s gotta be the craziest story anybody&#039;s ever tried to sell me. But I never saw anything like that gadget you pulled either, so I guess I&#039;ve gotta believe it. So where&#039;s little britches?”</p><p class="double">“Could be he&#039;s skipped this loop, could be he&#039;s swapped with me. Pretty much anything can happen with the loops.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Great and Powerful Trixie, you&#039;ve got to vanquish the ursa.”</p><p class="double">The Unawake stage magician freaked as she watched two hundred hooves of astrological ursine stride down the main street of Ponyville. “But... no-pony can vanquish an Ursa! I just made up the story to make my act better!”</p><p class="double">Snips and Snails went through the border checkpoint of &#039;Uh oh!&#039; and joined her in the land of freaking out.</p><p class="double">She mustered her magic, got ready to try and stop it, when the beast&#039;s jaws gaped, and it said in a surprisingly teenage voice, “Hey, pony lady, I don&#039;t want trouble, I just want someone to tell me what the heck is going on! What kind of crazy dream is this? I go to sleep in my bed at Higher for Hire, and next thing I&#039;m waking up in some cave somewhere with those two running around my feet! What am I, what are you, what&#039;s going on?”</p><p class="double">“What? What...” Trixie was eloquent in her incomprehension, at least until her eyes rolled up and she fainted.</p><p class="double">“Well that was helpful.” The bear groused. “You two, do whatever you do for fainted ponies, I&#039;m sitting right here until someone comes up with some answers.” He sat back on his haunches in the main square, carefully, checking to see he didn&#039;t crush anything by accident.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So what normally happens next?” Scootaloo asked, as Louie brought over their triple split sundaes, towering concoctions of fruit, ice cream and whipped cream.</p><p class="double">“Don Karnage and his yahoos generally show up, looking for Kit and that gem. I usually have us high-tail it out of here before then, but I don&#039;t think we can make it...”</p><p class="double">The doors slammed open, and Karnage and his goons strode through them. Scootaloo dropped down behind her stool and whispered, “You go get your plane started, I&#039;ll distract them.”</p><p class="double">“You sure kiddo? These are dangerous guys.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve got this. Make sure those sundaes are to go, I&#039;m not missing out on that.”</p><p class="double">“I am sorry to fracture the festivities,” the pirate captain announced, walking in and picking up a drink off the table, “but I have a little announcement.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was already using the tables as cover to get around to a balcony, the perfect place to attract their attention. Meanwhile Karnage was wasting time posing and threatening Louie. Oh, he was getting extra for that!</p><p class="double">She got in position and made her preparations just as one of the pirates fired a warning shot at the roof.</p><p class="double">“Hey, no need to wreck the place, Karny!” she called out. “I was just leaving anyway!”</p><p class="double">The red wolf crook&#039;s head snapped round, and he yelled, “Get him!”</p><p class="double">Three pirates charged up the stairs towards her just as she jumped up on the rail, snatching a tiki mask to use as an improvised board, and slid down the bannister, springing and tumbling over the hands that grasped for her. She&#039;d already plotted her route from when she flew off the end, and spun end for end while grabbing a bowl of soup from a passing table. The pirates finally managed to get themselves turned round and followed her back down the stairs. As they did, she flung the bowl to smash just under where the lead pirate, a whiny suck-up be the name of Mad Dog was about to put his foot. He slipped, fell and in the process tripped the pirates charging down after him, leaving them in a nice pile at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p class="double">Of course, Scootaloo had other problems to cope with, namely a problematic pirate captain with a pointy cutlass who&#039;d jumped into her path, legs wide and sword out. She&#039;d turned back to face him, and he sneered at her. “It is the funny joke you are making, but I shall have the last ha ha!”</p><p class="double">“Pass!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo snatched the nearest thing she could see, a serving fork from a half eaten roast, and folded backwards, limboing low on her board to slide between the pirate&#039;s akimbo legs, and fending off the cutlass with the fork. Just to finish off, she prodded him from behind with the fork as she slid onwards, sending him jumping with a yowl of pain.</p><p class="double">She straightened up just in time to push her way through the now empty doors, and cursed not having enough time to say something like, <i>The forks are strong in this one...</i> Pansy, who&#039;d gotten caught up on hub universe fiction, groaned inside her head. She was heading down the pier, slowing as she ran out of momentum, and at the end was a yellow cargo seaplane with a red bow and it&#039;s engines turning over.</p><p class="double">Baloo stuck his head out the open door. “You okay, kiddo?”</p><p class="double">“Never better!” She bounded off the tiki mask as she noticed a familiar heavily armed tri-plane docked near him. “Get moving, I&#039;ll be along in a moment!”</p><p class="double">She might not be in Apple Bloom&#039;s league when it came to gadgets, but she knew something about aircraft engines. She flipped the cowling and ripped out a number of important wires, throwing them out to sea.</p><p class="double">There was a howl of fury as Don Karnage burst out of Louie&#039;s, followed by his goons. “Stop him... Shoot you ridiculous rodents!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo ducked as a blast from a blunderbuss shot over her head, then weaved her way along the dock as other blasts peppered the air around her. At least one took off half the propeller of another pirate biplane. She reached the already moving Sea Duck and dived through the doorway, slamming the door after her.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve bought us some time... Maybe I should have flown it away... no, too much start up time.”</p><p class="double">The seaplane was already surging forward under Baloo&#039;s skilled coaxing. “C&#039;mon baby... wait, you can fly?”</p><p class="double">“Anything from a Sopwith Camel to a Star Destroyer!” Scootaloo responded proudly, “Though in-loop, not yet, though I&#039;ve mad for planes as long as I can remember.”</p><p class="double">“Well you&#039;d better buckle up!” The Sea Duck lurched as the keel unstuck from the water and it soared up into the sky. “Yahoooo! Oh man, there&#039;s no better feeling than hitting the blue!”</p><p class="double">Baloo threw the Sea Duck into a barrel roll, taking the chance to check the island below, “Hey, looks like you got Don Kebab and his mixed meatheads all riled up.”</p><p class="double">“That was the idea. You should know that while that guy can keep an idea in his head, unlike the rest of them, two is beyond him. I didn&#039;t just escape, I publicly embarrassed him. He&#039;s going to want to catch me alive himself simply so he can personally chop me into bite sized pieces. That means he&#039;s not letting the rest of his goons follow us until his plane&#039;s fixed, and it should keep him from taking it out on the bystanders at Louie&#039;s.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but when he gets fixed up, he&#039;s going to be after us horse, foot and marines.”</p><p class="double">Baloo was slightly shocked by the calculation in the young ponies voice, and some part of it must have leaked into his voice, because Scootaloo looked over at the bear in the pilot&#039;s seat, then turned and hung her head. “I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;ve kind of taken you for granted. I&#039;m not your friend Kit, I&#039;m just someone who met you a few hours ago and already I&#039;ve dragged you into danger with me.”</p><p class="double">“Hey kiddo, don&#039;t sweat it. Ol&#039; Karny and me have crossed propellers plenty of times, and he&#039;s always been the one who ditched at the end of it. Besides, I&#039;d never leave anyone in the clutches of that two bit pirate.”</p><p class="double">“Well anyway, thanks. So where are we heading?”</p><p class="double">“Cape Suzette, you&#039;re going to love it!” They were straight and level, and he looked over at the pegasus, grinning. He flipped open a compartment to reveal two slightly melted triple splits. ”I even got desert. Chow down.”</p><p class="double">It only took a few moments to polish off the sundaes, and Scootaloo looked over the plane she was in properly for the first time. The cockpit had the look of long use, but had been well cared for and extensively customised. Some of the tweaks almost seemed familiar. She consulted her in-loop memories. “Wow, this is a pretty sweet set-up. A Conwing L-16 with Super-Flight 100 customised engines? This thing must really move!”</p><p class="double">“Good eye kiddo!” Baloo patted the console. “Yup, she&#039;s my baby. Me and Wild Bloom have spent a lot of time getting her just right... Wait... what?”</p><p class="double">“If that&#039;s who I think it is, sounds like I&#039;m not the only fused looper. Earth-pony, good with gadgets? Yellow coat, red mane in a bow?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much, though she wears a jumpsuit... Except she should be a male lion called Wildcat. But I remember meeting up with her, working together on the Sea Duck, everything just as clearly. Oh man, this is too weird!”</p><p class="double">“Welcome to the wonderful world of fused loops. Your in-loop memories say one thing, your real memories say another. We&#039;ve gotta get you doing some mental exercises to help you keep things straight.”</p><p class="double">“Whoa, I ain&#039;t any kind of brain, kiddo.” Baloo shook his head.</p><p class="double">“Neither was I, but even I managed to learn them. Besides, if you can get it down, you can learn to create a sub-space pocket, a way to store things so you can carry them between loops.”</p><p class="double">“Now that sounds like a mighty useful thing to know!” The big bear glanced over at the young pony, who was looking at the control yoke in front of her with a familiar eagerness. “So, you said you can fly. Can you fly a Conwing L-16?”</p><p class="double">“Never tried, but I&#039;d love to find out!” Scootaloo reached out and took hold of the yoke, closing her eyes for a moment as her fingers closed around the grips. She seemed to freeze for a moment, attentive to something only she could sense. “Hello, Sea Duck. Baloo&#039;s lucky to have you.”</p><p class="double">Baloo had seen Kit take his first grasp of the Sea Duck&#039;s controls dozens of times, and for all his natural talent, he was quite naturally somewhat clumsy when he actually took the yoke. Scootaloo was different. When her eyes opened, they flicked back and forth across the instruments as easily as his own. She held the Sea Duck steady and on course like a veteran pilot, and he started to believe what she&#039;d told him, not just with his head, but with his heart.</p><p class="double">“Can I, please?” she asked, and didn&#039;t need to say more. At his nod, she started doing gentle turns and banks around their base course. She&#039;d flown planes far faster than this, and far more advanced, but she could feel that this one, for all it&#039;s primitive technology and limited flight envelope was something special. What she really wanted to do was try out some real stunts, she knew the Sea Duck could take them, but she was only too aware of the privilege she&#039;d been given by flying the Sea Duck at all, and she didn&#039;t want to abuse it.</p><p class="double">However, her piloting experience included a lot of combat flying, and it was that that caused her to suddenly go into a wing-over and dive.</p><p class="double">“Hey what the...” Baloo was answered by the whistle of machine gun bullets behind them.</p><p class="double">“Six coming in four o clock high!” Scootaloo rapped out, putting the Sea Duck in a tight roll that put her into a nearby cloudbank. “You have the stick?”</p><p class="double">Baloo had grabbed his own yoke as soon as they&#039;d started spinning, but he&#039;d let Scootaloo complete the manoeuvre, as it was pretty much what he&#039;d have done himself. “Roger little dodger, now watch this pre-formance!”</p><p class="double">The cloudbank ran out unexpectedly, ejecting them into a maze of towering storm clouds, lightning crackling around them. The pirate biplanes shot out a few seconds later, but scattered and no longer in the deadly staggered echelon formation they&#039;d previously held. Baloo played an expert game of tag with the pirates, swooping, zooming, turning and spinning to somehow out-manoeuvre fighters in a cargo plane.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was itching to get involved, but this was Baloo&#039;s world and his plane. She wasn&#039;t used to being a passenger while some-pony else was paying the freight. However, she tried to sit back and appreciate the big bear&#039;s clear mastery of the situation. At one point he managed to do a wing-over and return to fly straight through the bad guys, scattering them like pigeons, then trolled them into following him into a power dive, right to sea level.</p><p class="double">The seat of her pants that Scootaloo wasn&#039;t wearing felt distinctly uncomfortable as they headed for the water, but it was clear Baloo had some plan in mind, and she managed to hold on to her impatience and the sides of her seat as at the last split-second he pulled a lever who&#039;s function had puzzled her and leading edge flaps flipped up, altering the angle of attack and giving him the lift to pull out into level flight. Several splashes behind them indicated the lead pirates hadn&#039;t been so lucky.</p><p class="double">“Okay, now that was cool!” The pegasus glanced up and back. “But there are some still up there and they&#039;ve got us pinned against the sea. I&#039;ve got some tricks of my own that might help...”</p><p class="double">“No need kiddo, see those puffs of smoke?” Baloo pointed to some cliffs ahead with a narrow gorge between them. There were white puffballs appearing from around the tops.</p><p class="double">“AA Fire?” Scootaloo asked, and was answered seconds later by bursting noises from above. She glanced out of the window and saw explosions above in the heart of the pirate pack. They scattered and high-tailed it out of there with Karnage&#039;s plane in the lead.</p><p class="double">“Yep! The cliff guns of Cape Suzette. Drives &#039;em crazy!” Baloo said with a lazy grin as they climbed away from the sea. Scootaloo switched her gaze away from the approaching cliffs and to her companion, who was relaxing back in his seat.</p><p class="double">“You know, you remind me a lot of Rainbow Dash... I think you saw her in the pictures. She&#039;s the rainbow maned pegasus and she&#039;s the most awesome flyer in Equestria. She&#039;s also the Element of Loyalty and would never leave some-pony hanging.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like you think a lot of her.”</p><p class="double">“Well yeah, she basically took me under her wing, taught me everything she knew and is pretty much my big sister. I guess you and Kit have something similar. I really hope he starts looping soon himself. You both deserve it.”</p><p class="double">There was no calculation in the pony&#039;s voice this time, and Baloo made a decision. “Well until he gets back, seems I&#039;ll be needing a replacement navigator. You up for the job?”</p><p class="double">“Am I ever!” Scootaloo returned eagerly.</p><p class="double">“Then welcome aboard, Scoots.” Baloo opened a storage compartment and handed her a green baseball cap. She put it on as they flew through the gorge and out into a wide lagoon.</p><p class="double">“Oh, wow!” Once again, Scootaloo had seen far larger and taller cities in her time, but this was one of the prettiest. Art deco towers with sky bridges made a wide crescent around a vast lagoon with an island in it, and were built back into the hillsides of the bowl that enclosed it. And everywhere there was air-traffic, dirigibles, sea-planes, flying back and forth. It made Canterlot sky-port look like a village cross-roads in January.</p><p class="double">She noticed one of the biggest towers had a logo which her in-loop memories told her stood for Sher Khan, and that jogged her memory. She pulled out the box. “Oh, hey, I&#039;ve still got this. Want to hand it over to Khan before Karny and his merry mutts make another grab for it? In short, what&#039;s the plan, big man?”</p><p class="double">“Huh, normally Kit hides it back at Louie&#039;s... Welp, I hook up with Kit, head on back to base, find out I missed the last six payments on the Duck and have to stump up three large ones, three thousand bucks or they&#039;ll foreclose at nine tomorrow.” He grinned. “Of course lately, as soon as I find myself back at Louie&#039;s at the start of each... loop? I ring up a bookie in Cape Suzette and put on some accumulators I know will pay out. Easy money.</p><p class="double">“But first time round, we did a high ticket mission which I blew when Karny captures Kit, and he offers to share the reward for the gem in that box, except it&#039;s not a gem, it&#039;s some sub-electron dohickey that can create a lot of power. Khan&#039;s willing to fork over a solid hundred thousand for it&#039;s return, and Karny wants to use it to build a lightning cannon to come plunder Cape Suzette.”</p><p class="double">He shrugged. “Man, first time round we went all over the place to try and get that thing back. Turns out Becky, that is Rebecca Cunningham, bought up the company from the bank to run, which made her my boss. Now I don&#039;t fuss about business, flying&#039;s all I&#039;m interested in, so I was trying to find the fifty k to buy myself out of hock. Cutting out the drama, the pirates make their play, we stop them, destroying the stone in the process.</p><p class="double">“I end up back behind the eight ball, flying for Higher for Hire, Becky&#039;s new name for the company, with her as the boss lady. Of course, now I&#039;ve been round the block a couple dozen times, I can get round that easy enough, and did, but you know, it&#039;s like that time I saved Khan&#039;s life and he gave me pretty much anything I asked for, or when I found out I&#039;d inherited a fortune and a big house. It got lonely being just me, or even me and Kit. So now I let her buy the place just to get her involved.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like quite a lady.” Scootaloo replied. “Is she your special some-pony... some-body?”</p><p class="double">Baloo barked out a laugh. “Me and Beckers? Not in a million years! We&#039;d drive each other crazy, heck, we do drive each other crazy! She&#039;s a stickler for everything being just so, and I like to take a more relaxed att-i-tude. She&#039;s pushy, bossy, mercenary, comes up with crazy moneymaking schemes at the drop of a hat... and she&#039;s someone I&#039;d trust with my life, and a good friend.”</p><p class="double">“Except for the moneymaking part, that sounds just like another friend of mine, Diamond Tiara. I wonder if she&#039;ll be showing up here. If Apple Bloom is here, we might see some others...”</p><p class="double">“Man, how many more are there?”</p><p class="double">Recounting the other members of the Crusaders took them all the way round the bay and until they taxied up to the dilapidated dock that led to the ramshackle building that housed &#039;Baloo&#039;s Air Cargo Service&#039;. Except the was freshly painted and now said, &#039;Higher for Hire&#039;.</p><p class="double">“What the Sam Hill?” Baloo shook his head in disbelief, and stormed out of the Sea Duck and up the dock.</p><p class="double">A pink female pony of more adult proportions with wavy purple hair held back with a bandana was backing out of the doorway. She wore a white turtleneck and violet slacks, and was carrying a bale of old newspapers neatly tied up with string.</p><p class="double">“Hey lady, who are you and what do you think you&#039;re doin&#039;?” Baloo called out.</p><p class="double">She dropped the bundle besides a bunch of others and turned to face him. “The names Tara, Tara Cunningham, and as of 9 am this morning I own this place and that plane.”</p><p class="double">“But that&#039;s not till tomorrow, and you ain&#039;t Beckers...”</p><p class="double">Wild Bloom came out, equally grown up, wearing a tatty set of overalls and carrying a box of junk. Her mid-Usland accent was even more pronounced than usual. “Sorry Baloo, I tried to boost the radio to get you the message, but the bank came with the paperwork yesterday. She&#039;s got a bunch of lawyer&#039;s papers and everything.”</p><p class="double">Baloo started to get mad, then realised something. “Then I&#039;ve got just one question for you all. Are you Awake?”</p><p class="double">The stress he put on the word clearly hit a bullseye. Tara slumped slightly and said. “Oh darn, and I wanted to see if I could turn this place into something that could give Khan Insustries a run for their money.”</p><p class="double">He heard Scootaloo&#039;s voice behind him. “Guys, this is Baloo Von Bruinwald, Anchor and our host for this loop. He&#039;s still in his first century. I gave him the intro speech and told him about us. Do we have Sweetie Belle and Nyx on board?”</p><p class="double">The two ponies in question came out, younger than usual and wearing rompers. Sweetie Belle exclaimed, “Present, and I hate being a rug-rat!”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara waved a hand at them and said, “Meet my &#039;daughters&#039;, Belle and Nyx Cunningham.”</p><p class="double">Wild Bloom rubbed the back of her head and said, “Sorry guys, but this world doesn&#039;t have computer records, if you want to bump your ages a bit, it&#039;ll have to wait until we can find the paperwork and rig it.”</p><p class="double">Baloo was looking around at the five of them, and just shook his head. “Man, and I thought my life was complicated enough already!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo grinned as she joined up with the other Crusaders. “Don&#039;t think of it as complicated, think of it as interesting!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Come on.&quot; Apple Bloom was smirking. &quot;I know you have one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....the shape was good for runic circles,&quot; Silver Spoon admitted.</p><p class="double">&quot;AHA! I knew it! Let&#039;s see, come on!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And silver&#039;s a good material!&quot; continued the currently Saddle Arabian filly. &quot;It&#039;s not like I--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Silver, I&#039;ve made mechanical flowering fruits. Sweetie&#039;s created shaped candies that ring. Heck, Diamond <i>wears</i> hers in the baseline.&quot; The farmfilly shook her head. &quot;It&#039;s nothing to be ashamed of.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a resigned sigh, Silver reached into her subspace pocket and pulled out something twice her size.</p><p class="double">Pinkie chose that moment to walk in. &quot;...that is one big spoon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Apple Bloom pointed at a small stain. &quot;Is that...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, yeah. I used this in fights a lot.&quot; Silver shrugged. &quot;It made sense at the time.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.3 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double">The Incredible Mac</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac awoke. The first thing he noticed were the murmurs of shock around him. At first, he thought they might be directed at him, but no, they seemed to be directed at a teenage boy riding his motorcycle through the desert in front of him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whats he doing? He&#039;s going to be killed!&quot; said a gruff, male voice beside him.</p><p class="double">He didn&#039;t know what was going on; his loop memories hadn&#039;t set in, but he knew he couldn&#039;t let that happen. He leaped out of the bunker he was in and ran toward him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">He hadn&#039;t gotten far when the first of his loop memories hit him. All from his first memories to the latest last night.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">He&#039;d been working on something called a Gamma Bomb? These human loops were always kinda weird. But then again, Trixie would&#039;ve probably gone gaga for something like that.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d been doing some last minute checks on the thing with his fiancee Betty Ross. </p><p class="double">&#039;Fiance, huh? Wonder if she&#039;s awake or not?&#039;</p><p class="double">The door opened. In walked two people his loop memories instantly recognized as General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross and Major Glenn Talbot. His loop memories and the looks those two were giving him told him that they didn&#039;t like him and that the feeling was mutual.</p><p class="double">“Is everything ready on the Gamma Bomb?” there was a tone of barely restrained anger in the General&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">“Yup.”</p><p class="double">The General&#039;s eyebrow visibly twitched. He turned to Betty and his expression softened immediately.</p><p class="double">“Betty, can I talk to you for a second? In private?”</p><p class="double">“What is it Father? If you can say it in front of me, you can say it in front of Bruce.” there was an edge to her voice.</p><p class="double">General Ross nodded to the Major. “Leave us for a few minutes, Major.”</p><p class="double">“Yes sir.” He saluted and left.</p><p class="double">The General composed himself. “You know I don&#039;t approve of your dating ...”</p><p class="double">“Not this again!” she cried. “We&#039;ve been over this before. We&#039;ve got nothing to talk about! “ </p><p class="double">“Betty..”</p><p class="double">“I really think you should go.”</p><p class="double">The General turned to Bruce and his face hardened. “This isn&#039;t the last of it. Don&#039;t even think for a moment that I&#039;ll let you marry my daughter.” saying that, he put his hat back on his head and left.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Which lead him back to today. The Gamma Bomb was going to explode, and some dumb kid decided to drive out in the middle of the testing site.</p><p class="double">Getting him to safety me managed to toss the kid into the bunker just as the blast was about to hit. &#039;Whelp, looks like this&#039;ll be one real short loop!&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac hurt. Near as he could tell he was in a bed, probably in a hospital, hopped up on anesthetics and worst of all, people were talking, preventing him from getting any rest.</p><p class="double">&#039;Why Mac hurt? Why people talk? Why can&#039;t they just leave Mac alone?&#039; he wondered to himself.</p><p class="double">“severe concussion, broken arm...” Through the fog of the anesthesia, he could just barely make anything out.</p><p class="double">“survived the gamma bomb..”</p><p class="double">“needs to be studied..”</p><p class="double">Something must have changed as his head got foggier, the voices vanished and he surrendered to sweet oblivion.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Good morning!” The one he knew as Betty Ross entered the room. She closed the door behind her and removed what looked like a small silvery notepad from somewhere. She fiddled with it for a few seconds and spoke.</p><p class="double">“Ok. No bugs....and I&#039;ve put up a privacy screen around this room. It should be safe to talk.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re looping?” Mac asked.</p><p class="double">“Yeppers.” Betty crossed the room and took a seat at Mac&#039;s bedside.</p><p class="double">“Well, that makes this less awkward.” Mac was visibly relieved.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m assuming you&#039;ve got some questions.”</p><p class="double">“Eyup. So does that bomb thing always happen?”</p><p class="double">“Mostly. Sometimes its a gamma reactor. Sometimes Bruce just like Gamma radiation and decides to experiment on himself. It varies.”</p><p class="double">“So is Bruce, I&#039;m assuming its not MacIntosh, the loop anchor?”</p><p class="double">“Banner. No he&#039;s just a looper, same as me. That kid you saved, Rick Jones, however, is the loop anchor. Well, probably. It could be Steve Rodgers, or possibly Doreen, or maybe that Parker kid. All we know is that those 4 loop a lot. Its...complicated.”</p><p class="double">“Complicated?”</p><p class="double">“Well, those 4 seem to be always looping, but we&#039;re not really sure if they&#039;re anchors.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm..”</p><p class="double">“Oh! Do you feel a pool of energy in your mind?”</p><p class="double">Mac closed his eyes.</p><p class="double">She continued. “One of the effects of the gamma radiation is that it tends to turn you into a huge mass of muscle. Go ahead. Try touching it.”</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean besides deadly radiation sickness?&quot;</p><p class="double">Betty sighed. &quot;Just do it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac reached out with mind and tried touching the pool of energy. From nothing, it became a raging torrent of energy that tore through him, giving Mac&#039;s already impressive muscles an even bigger boost. From here on, his bed started collapsing under the weight and his casts popped off from the stress. It took some effort, as the energy threatened to overwhelm him, and his muscles burned from the growth they were experiencing, but he managed to retain control of his mind.</p><p class="double">“<b>That was dangerous, Lady.”</b></p><p class="double">“But you did it!”</p><p class="double">“<b>What would&#039;ve happened if I hadn&#039;t”</b></p><p class="double">“You would&#039;ve rampaged across the dessert with the army and Father in hot pursuit.”</p><p class="double">Mac glared.</p><p class="double">“Please, it what usually happens whenever Bruce isn&#039;t awake.”</p><p class="double">Mac raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">“He, you, whatever, gets angsty about the transformation, which usually only triggers when he&#039;s mad, and becomes obsessed about trying to cure himself, which never works, because something or someone always interrupts it. Either the Hulk himself...”</p><p class="double">Mac looked quizzically at Betty.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s you, by the way. Or the Army, or SHIELD, or the Leader, or the Abomination...well you get the picture. Which brings me to my next point. Father had decided that since you absorbed all this radiation without any side-effects. Well, the normal side-effects of dying horribly of radiation sickness, that&#039;s something that must be studied and used for the benefit of the United States Army. He&#039;s transferring you to a secure facility in a few days. They&#039;ll be poking and prodding you for years until they get something useful. The fact that it&#039;ll separate us is just the cherry on top in Father&#039;s view.&quot;</p><p class="double">“<b>We&#039;ll have do something about that.” </b>A spring on his bed popped to as if to punctuate his last statement. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Betty and Rick stood out in the desert.</p><p class="double">“So you know the plan?” asked Betty</p><p class="double">“Who&#039;s the anchor here? If anything I should be asking you that.”</p><p class="double">“So..ask.”</p><p class="double">“Whats the plan?”</p><p class="double">“Ok, so you transform into Colossus...”</p><p class="double">Rick just glared.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, not Colossus, I meant The Thing.” said Betty, grinning.</p><p class="double">“Very funny, Ms, I&#039;m She-Hulk, but Red.”</p><p class="double">“Tough crowd. Fine...you transform into A-Bomb. That&#039;s still a dumb name, by the way, and I transform into Red She-Hulk, and we go in and bust out Bruce. He transforms, we fight and gracefully lose, Bruce is a hero, or at least less of pariah in Father&#039;s eyes.”</p><p class="double">“And if we&#039;re captured?”</p><p class="double">“Clones, from an alternate future, come to set right what once went wrong.”</p><p class="double">“Eh..close enough.”</p><p class="double">“So we leave now?” A distant explosion rocked the valley.</p><p class="double">“<b>I&#039;d stay that&#039;s a yes.”</b> said Rick as he transformed into a giant rock-like being with Betty transforming right behind him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The military convoy was in ruins. Soldiers either milled about expecting new orders, or waited to receive treatment. They raised their rifles as Red She-Hulk and A-Bomb approached.</p><p class="double">They put up their hands “<b>Whoa. We mean you no harm. What happened here?”</b></p><p class="double">“Thats classified.” said Major Glenn Talbot stepping forward.</p><p class="double">“<b>I think its obvious. Someone attacked the transport, made off with whatever cargo....and headed in that direction.”</b> said Red She-hulk, pointing to some tracks.</p><p class="double">“Lets go!” They leaped off in the direction of the tracks.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For the second time, Mac awoke in an unfamiliar environment. He was horizontal in a glass and metal tube. Restraints held down his arms and legs. Looking through the glass covering above him, he could see people in yellow clothes and masks at work beside him.</p><p class="double">&#039;They kinda look like beekeepers. No sign or Rick or Betty. Plan probably went wrong, so this is probably as good a time to make my entrance.&#039;</p><p class="double">Once again he tapped into that pool of green energy in his mind, and the tube suddenly became very cramped, but shattered as he continued growing. There were shouts of alarm and he continued freeing himself.</p><p class="double">“<b>Don&#039;t get up. I can help myself.” </b></p><p class="double">Finally freeing himself he leaped up through the ceiling, only to find himself in midair as he seemed to have just left some sort of aircraft. As he continued falling, the aircraft made a lazy turn and started heading back the way he came. Coming toward him and passing him? But it looked like something else emerged as it flew by. A silvery android, that hit the ground a minute after Mac did.</p><p class="double">“<b>What are you?”</b></p><p class="double">The only response from the android was to shift into a form similar to Mac&#039;s own, green and heavily muscled.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Avocado.&quot;</b> Mac swore. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&#039;Okay. What am I up against?&#039; asked Mac to himself as he dodged a blow to his head. The android seemed as strong and as durable as him. The fact that they&#039;d been fighting for 5 minutes already with no sign of the droid weakening meant that it probably had a pretty strong power source. The glowing aura coming from the android&#039;s chest confirmed it. But it also didn&#039;t seem to have that much in the way of imaginative. Its attacks were, no pun intended, mechanical and Mac was dodging most of them.</p><p class="double">&#039;Now what are my assets and skills.&#039; What most readily came to mind were his muscles, which he was already using. There was his bartender skills, but there wasn&#039;t a bar for miles, and unless he could challenge the droid to a contest of mixing drinks, didn&#039;t see how that would be any help. The android didn&#039;t seem to be open to negotiation, as he hadn&#039;t spoken at all, and hadn&#039;t visibly reacted to anything he&#039;d said. He wondered if this whole android business was just a stalling action for other reinforcements to move into position, but he&#039;d yet to see anyone else show up during the battle. Maybe this was a test of the android&#039;s abilities? Or maybe his?</p><p class="double">The only thing Mac hadn&#039;t tried were any of his earth pony abilities. He hadn&#039;t a chance to practice any of them in this body, and wasn&#039;t sure they would work, but this was as good a time as any.</p><p class="double">First, bucking. Mac charged his fist with power and swung at what looked like a vulnerable spot. The droid&#039;s left arm at the elbow came clean off, launching far into the distance. The droid paused for a moment, its elbow becoming liquid metal, stretching and reforming into another arm and hand.</p><p class="double">“<b>Eucalyptus.”</b></p><p class="double">&#039;This is going to be annoying, but this means I can probably puncture its chest cavity if it would just stop moving.&#039;</p><p class="double">The second ability he hadn&#039;t tried was earth pony plant growth. However, just from looking around he could see he was in a desert, and there wasn&#039;t much he could work with. Reaching out with his senses he tried to sense the plant life in the area. Not much, except he was detecting a bunch from inside the android. That didn&#039;t make sense, unless... you counted the various seeds and pollen usually in the air. This android must have an air intake, and have brought into itself thousands of tiny seeds. Normally, it wouldn&#039;t have been a problem, but...</p><p class="double">“<b>Lets add a little something to the mix!”</b> Mac reached into his subspace pocket and removed a packet of apple seeds. Perhaps not the best choice for what he was going to try, but it was what he had on hand. Once at the same time, he torn open and threw the opened bag at the android. At the same time he slammed his foot into the ground, pouring as much earth pony magic into it as he could. The explosion of plant growth was enormous. Right in front of him grew an enormous apple tree, a conglomeration of at least a hundred seeds, which as it expanded threw him back.</p><p class="double">Mac landed not so gracefully. The tree continued expanding, but slower now. Mac leaped into the branches to see if he could locate the android. Reaching out with his senses, he could feel it...there! Using his earth pony magic, he bent a path through the ever expanding branches.</p><p class="double">Mac finally found the android. It was completely locked down the branches of the tree, and could gain no leverage as it tried to free itself.</p><p class="double">“<b>Still moving, huh?”</b> Mac reached up with his fist charged, grabbed through the android&#039;s abdomen to the source of its power he felt earlier. It promptly stopped moving.</p><p class="double">Through the light of the tree, Mac examined what he pulled out. It seemed to be a small glass cube, about a 3 centimeters in length on all sides, and it literally pulsed with energy. He tossed it into his subspace pocket. He could examine it later if he got access to a proper lab.</p><p class="double">He then went out and waited for someone to arrive.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac didn&#039;t have to wait long. It was another few minutes before a helicopter approached his position and landed.</p><p class="double">&#039;A giant tree appearing in the middle of the desert must be an incredible beacon.&#039;</p><p class="double">It had a circular emblem of what was probably a stylized falcon on it. Its side opened up, and occupants that he mostly recognized popped out. He could see someone who probably Betty and what she had described as Rick in his A-Bomb form along with General Ross. Also, a bunch of agents in blue uniforms that appeared to be commanded by am eye-patched woman with purple hair that he felt he should have recognized, but didn&#039;t. The agents in blue surrounded him with rifles pointed at him.</p><p class="double">Mac shifted to his human form. Privately, Mac wondered where the purple pants had come from, and why when he switched back, his pants were back to normal.</p><p class="double">“General. Unknown Gamma mutated beings who I&#039;ve never seen before.” and then he turned to the woman. “I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t have the honor, Miss..”</p><p class="double">“Nicole, Nicole Sparkle, Director of SHIELD.”</p><p class="double">Recognition finally hit Mac. “Pleased to meet you, Director Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“This is all very well, but we&#039;ll need to take Mr. MacIntosh into custody. He&#039;s vital to the interests of the US military.”</p><p class="double">“I think we could possibly come to an arrangement. Mr. MacIntosh, how would you like to come work for me?”</p><p class="double">The General sputtered.</p><p class="double">“This offer would apply to you two as well,” nodding to Rick and Betty, who decided to shift to human form as well at this point.</p><p class="double">“Betty? What? How?”</p><p class="double">“Merged with a temporal duplicate of myself from alternate timeline.” said Betty.</p><p class="double">“Same.” mentioned Rick</p><p class="double">“Director, I think I&#039;d like to take you up on that offer.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie left the stage to the sound of cheers. “Ah, now that&#039;s something which I <i>really</i> enjoy about Looping.”</p><p class="double">Her glamorous assistant followed her, using a towel to clean whipped cream off her face. “Why do I always get splatted?”</p><p class="double">Trixie turned, looking indignant. “Firstly, because slapstick is always funny. Second, it&#039;s not always you. I got gunged back in Trottingham.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; towel stopped moving. “Okay, I had forgotten that one.”</p><p class="double">“Lucky you,” Trixie muttered. “It took me half an hour to clean my cloak.” Then she got a mischievous look on her face, darted forwards and licked some of the cream off.</p><p class="double">The disguised Changeling flinched momentarily. “Gah! Warn me next time!”</p><p class="double">“Make me,” Trixie challenged, sticking her tongue out.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; eyes narrowed. “Maybe I will,” she said, as they reached the wagon.</p><p class="double">Bigger on the inside, of course. Trixie&#039;s baseline wagon was fine for one, but applying a simple Potterverse charm on it made it suitable for two without Trixie having to tow a Conestoga.</p><p class="double">“Shouldn&#039;t we set off first?” Trixie asked, a quaver in her voice. “I mean, we do need to get to Manehattan by tomorrow evening, and it&#039;s a fair way.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you should have thought of that first,” Chrysalis said reasonably. She dropped her shapeshift.</p><p class="double">There was a flash of light, and an envelope landed on the table.</p><p class="double">“...huh.” Trixie trotted over and picked it up. “I wasn&#039;t expecting a letter. Were you?”</p><p class="double">“Changelings don&#039;t bother with post,” Chrysalis pointed out.</p><p class="double">“And it&#039;s not from one of your lovers in every port of call?” Trixie teased.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis winced, then grinned. “Okay, you win this round. Now, what&#039;s in the letter?”</p><p class="double">Trixie slit the seal, holding it up for inspection. “Canterlot master of ceremonies, very posh. I remember whenever Twilight and I are co-students of Celestia, we saw a lot of this.”</p><p class="double">“Usually attached to damage bills and the occasional lawsuit, if I recall right,” Chrysalis snarked.</p><p class="double">“Same difference.” Trixie drew the contents out. “Oh. Oh-ho-ho!”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked over her shoulder. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">Trixie moved the letter so she couldn&#039;t see. “Aherm. &#039;The Master of Ceremonies of Canterlot Palace has been requested and ordered by their majesties, Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, to invite you, Trixie Lulamoon, along with guest, to the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in one month&#039;s time.&#039;”</p><p class="double">They exchanged glances. And then, in near perfect unison, grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What on Equestria is <i>that?</i>” Blueblood said, staring at the newest entrants to the hall.</p><p class="double">Trixie tossed her head, making her starred dress ripple and catch the light. “Yes, bask in the reflected awe of the Great and Powerful Trixie!”</p><p class="double">“Not <i>you</i>,” Blueblood said, frowning. “I mean the... the... <i>thing</i> next to you?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Oh</i>,” Trixie said in tones of sudden understanding, nodding exaggeratedly. “You must mean my date. She has a name, and it&#039;s Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">Seeing that most of the room was now staring, Trixie patted Chrysalis on the back. “She&#039;s a queen, you know.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis beamed at the room. This only showed her fangs, which made some of the assembled notables back away a bit.</p><p class="double">“Chryssy!” Celestia said, sweeping into the room with her student and her sister trailing behind her. “I&#039;m so glad you could make it!”</p><p class="double">“My pleasure,” Chrysalis replied warmly. “How is your sister doing?”</p><p class="double">“I am fine, thank you,” Luna answered for her sister, making a slight bow. “I don&#039;t believe I have met your date, however.”</p><p class="double">Trixie fought to keep a straight face, as the five Loopers all acted as though it was perfectly normal to see a Changeling at the Gala.</p><p class="double">Sure, explosions were cool. But as far as pranking the Gala went, Blueblood&#039;s expression right now was <i>priceless.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">48.5</p><p class="double">“I feel weird...” Silver said, experimentally ruffling her wings.</p><p class="double">Her aunt, Gilda, looked down at her with a mildly parental expression. “Not surprised, fledgeling, you&#039;re a whole new body type.”</p><p class="double">“Something like that happened a couple ago, too,” Silver informed her. “My first fused loop, where I picked up Alchemy and Alkahestry, I had two missing limbs.”</p><p class="double">“Cool,” Gilda declared, nodding. “That was probably your formative loop, then.”</p><p class="double">“Do those always happen?” Silver spread her wings and beat them as fast as she could, rising a little off the ground. “Ow, this is exhausting.”</p><p class="double">Gilda reached out a foreclaw and supported her breastbone. “Easy, fledgeling. Flying&#039;s as much about technique as brute force, doing it like that&#039;s only going to strain something. And no, they don&#039;t always happen.” Silver stopped trying to fly, and Gilda deposited her back on the ground. “I&#039;ll teach you in a sec. Some loopers – a lot of human ones seem to do this – just keep learning from a lot of different loops, never really picking a speciality. Some of our locals just don&#039;t have the <i>need</i> to develop a specific skill set over others – take Sparkle, she&#039;s all about magic.”</p><p class="double">“I see... I think,” Silver said slowly. “And... your formative one was wherever you picked up that weird magic you do?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Gilda demonstrated, letting her body bleach white. After a few seconds, tufts of fur or feathers developed at her haunches, and red accents touched up her otherwise brilliant white coat.</p><p class="double">Her tail-tip seemed to be on the verge of releasing a drop of ink.</p><p class="double">“I learned a couple of forms of the brush magic there, and then picked up the rest a bit at a time.” Gilda&#039;s colours went back to normal in a moment. “I&#039;ve also become a dab hand at painting, too, which is nice. Stress-relieving.”</p><p class="double">Silver nodded along. “What about – Tiara?”</p><p class="double">“Her?” Gilda cawed laughter. “She&#039;s the most hard-assed bitch I&#039;ve ever met – and that&#039;s a compliment, really. She&#039;s basically picked up two things – psychic powers, you know, telepathy and scrub like that, and also a mean tactical sense.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Silver Spoon thought that over for a bit.</p><p class="double">“Hey – how do gryphons... well, the gryphon government. How does that work?”</p><p class="double">Gilda sat back. “Okay, so we&#039;re predator-types. I&#039;ll bet you see me instinctively as big and tough, and there&#039;s a little niggle in the back of your mind evaluating if you could take me.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Silver blushed. “I didn&#039;t know I was so... arrogant?”</p><p class="double">“Gryphons are arrogant, it&#039;s healthy.” Gilda waved it off. “So, we&#039;re arranged into... well, prides or packs, the meaning is the same. Your village is a pack, your county is a pack formed of the village higher-ups, and so on up to Imperial level. You can move up in two ways – either by election, which is sort of a contest of strength of mind, or by combat, which is a contest of strength of body.”</p><p class="double">The elder looper waved her foreleg. “Elections are kinda recent, historically speaking. Anyway, you can only challenge either way within a pack. So if Joe Average Gryphon wanted to become Emperor, he&#039;d start at the village level. If he won there, he&#039;d be a member of the county pack, and could move up there, and so on.”</p><p class="double">“What about you?”</p><p class="double">Gilda coughed. “I have an unfair advantage. I&#039;m... well, we&#039;re... sort of members of the Imperial family. That counts as a pack, too.”</p><p class="double">Silver digested that for a bit.</p><p class="double">“Griffin civil wars must be complicated.”</p><p class="double">“Yep, pretty much.” Gilda shrugged. “Mind you, the pack leader usually has a band of sworn talons who he can have kick the arses of any potential challenger, so he doesn&#039;t have to spend the whole day fighting. In practise, successful challenges involve those sworn talons either stepping aside or getting whupped en masse – and either way, we as a species tend to be alright with that.”</p><p class="double">“I think I see. So...” Silver examined one of her claws minutely. “So it all gets sorted out in duels?”</p><p class="double">“Better than wars,” Gilda agreed. “And we do a <i>lot</i> of betting on the outcomes.”</p><p class="double">“So.” Silver raised her wings again. “Flying?”</p><p class="double">“Right. Flight basics.” Gilda thought for a bit. “First off, how to glide. It&#039;s fairly simple in practise, just hold your wings out stiff.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s it?” Silver followed the instructions. “Now what?”</p><p class="double">“Now...” Gilda grinned. “We teach you the gryphon way.”</p><p class="double">Her tail slashed across left to right three times, making a set of three parallel horizontal lines.</p><p class="double">The resultant instant tornado sent Silver rocketing over three hundred feet into the air.</p><p class="double">“Okay!” Gilda shouted up. “Now... sorta fall less.”</p><p class="double">“HOW?” Silver asked, panicking.</p><p class="double">“Stop falling!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I officially hate gryphon teaching methods,” Silver muttered, pulling twigs out of her feathers.</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged. “You were really making progress there. Before you hit the tree. All cleared out?”</p><p class="double">Silver inspected her wings. “I think so.”</p><p class="double">“Good!” Gilda said, bringing her tail up again. “Ready for gliding practise session two?”</p><p class="double">With a yelp, Silver turned and fled.</p><p class="double">The elder gryphon chuckled, walking lazily after her. “Wonder when she&#039;ll notice she just flew up the cliff...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.6 (Vulpine Fury):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mac?&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmer-become-bartender raised his head in curiosity. &quot;Eeyup?&quot;</p><p class="double">...and was bowled over by a smiling and crying Cheerilee. &quot;I&#039;m home!

He really hoped this wasn&#039;t one of those loops where ponies had Soulmate Timers on their hooves or some-such mechanical matchmaking and he&#039;d missed the Memory. It wouldn&#039;t be the first time. If he&#039;d done the math right, the Loops liked to hook up his baseline version with the schoolmarm about one in three times, which could make things like pre-scheduled dates awkward if he Awoke later than usual.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m home! I&#039;m home!&quot;</p><p class="double">Wait.</p><p class="double">He definitely would have remembered if she had moved in.

That was a plausible reason for her to Loop. And now Applebloom was included in the hug? So probably not that problem. Was this how Shining Armor felt around the looping changeling queen?</p><p class="double">Macintosh made a mental note to pay particular attention to Cheerilee in the coming loop. Wistful sighs, stares into the distance, brief disappointed glimpses, unexplained bouts of grief, these would all be looked for.

<p>49.1</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon gathered herself, ready to return to Equestria and take her vengeance.</p><p class="double">“Come along, children, this way!” a cheerful voice said.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait, what?</i> The Nightmare looked in the direction of the voice, which was behind a small hill, and crept up to the lip of the ridgeline so as to look over.</p><p class="double">A motley group of confused-looking colts and fillies were gazing around themselves, or occasionally picking something up to marvel at the low weight. One, a pegasus, was flapping her small wings frantically and beaming as the effort resulted in a hover.</p><p class="double">At the head of the group were two adult mares. One was an earth pony with a daisy-based cutie mark and carrying a piece of chalk in the side of her mouth, while the other was a purple unicorn levitating a blackboard alongside them. Nightmare Moon could also sense the magic side-wash of a powerful air bubble spell, providing breathable air for the whole assemblage of ponies.</p><p class="double">The earth pony mare stopped and turned around, making Nightmare drop back out of sight in case she was spotted. There was the sound of something heavy landing on the regolith, and then the screeching of chalk on blackboard.</p><p class="double">“Now, who can tell me anything about the moon? Yes, Scootaloo?”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re so light here! It&#039;s awesome!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s correct.” The screech of more chalk. “The moon is smaller than Equestria, and a little less dense. That means that the total gravity here is only one sixth of that on the surface of our home planet. What about you, Snips?”</p><p class="double">“Uh... I guess there&#039;s that we can see Equestria. It&#039;s huge – and really bright!”</p><p class="double">“Yes. Like the moon is in our sky, we&#039;re in the moon&#039;s sky. But Equestria is several times larger than the moon, so since we&#039;re the same distance away from it as we normally are from the moon, it looks larger. And yes, Equestria reflects more light than the moon does, so it appears brighter.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare peered over the ridgeline again, using a convenient rock for cover.</p><p class="double">“Something else you might not have noticed about the moon,” the earth pony mare said, “is that it doesn&#039;t have an atmosphere. There&#039;s no air on the moon.”</p><p class="double">“Uh... what are we breathing, miss Cheerilee?” a unicorn filly asked. As she said that, an earth pony did an exaggeratedly dramatic act of suffocating.</p><p class="double">“Good question, Sweetie Belle. Twilight here didn&#039;t only get us to the moon, but also cast a spell which has given us air. If you could demonstrate, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">The air-bubble spell altered slightly.</p><p class="double">Twilight – presumably, at any rate – picked up a feather and a hammer from the tray of the blackboard. Holding them up, she dropped them.</p><p class="double">The feather drifted slowly to the ground, while the hammer fell as fast as things normally did on the moon.</p><p class="double">She retrieved them, and then dropped them outside the area of the air bubble. The hammer fell just as it had, but this time the feather fell just as fast.</p><p class="double">“Now, what happened there?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, it looks like it&#039;s home time, everypony. Tomorrow we&#039;re going to be doing the inner planets. Say thank you to Twilight for kindly lending her time!”</p><p class="double">“Thanks, Miss Twilight,” the children said in the not-in-unison chorus normal for school pupils.</p><p class="double">Then there was a bright purple flash, and Nightmare was alone once more.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t know quite how to take that. The fillies and colts had certainly seemed to be interested in her moon...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.2 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Luna, I think I need to visit my student in the near future.&quot; Celestia said, reading her mail.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Luna looked up from her book. &quot;Has Twilight Sparkle done something wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps? I&#039;m confused by the content of her friendship reports.

It seems Twilight Sparkle has learned a lesson in racial prejudice.&quot; Luna said, looking up from the scroll. &quot;Unorthodox as this letter is, it does get to the point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, often in a single sentence,&quot; Celestia sighed, &quot;But this is not what I had in mind when I asked her to write reports.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe thy poor student simply doesn&#039;t know else how to express what she&#039;s learning? As I understand this is beyond her previous experience.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Right, parasprites next.

Is the town under attack?&quot; Luna inquired, standing from her desk.</p><p class="double">Celestia pulled a scroll from under her wing. &quot;Look at her latest letter.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t ignore Pinkie, or she&#039;ll cut you.

While this required he be a fairly powerful cleric, courtesy of an adventuring career when he was considerably younger, in the present it mainly required paperwork, lots and lots of paperwork. At least it was a fine day, and the window to the balcony of his chambers was open, letting in a warm breeze as well as bright sunlight. However, as he craned over the latest scroll, the light dimmed as a shadow appeared across the window.</p><p class="double">He looked up and was shocked to see a pegasus standing there, perched on the balcony and completely unafraid. Pegasi were notoriously shy, and avoided human contact, which made those captured and trained as mounts worth a medium sized fortune. He&#039;d seen a number of odd things in his past career, but this was definitely up there. However, things got a whole lot weirder when the pegasus spoke. Pegasi were human smart, but they couldn&#039;t form words, everyone knew that, except apparently the pegasus in front of him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there, are you the guy in charge of this place?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I am, however, I am still a humble servant of Pelor. Bishop Bessemer, at your service.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great, the name&#039;s Rainbow Dash, and I&#039;ve got a problem I need some help with, your bishop-ship.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pelor tells us to help those who need it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cool! Okay, so I&#039;m a pegasus, but I&#039;m from another... plane, that&#039;s the term, and I just arrived here. Pegasi are a bit different where I come from, but I&#039;m stuck in a body for this world&#039;s version.&quot; She held up a hoof. &quot;Even a human body has better range of motion, and I lay eggs, and that&#039;s just plain wrong. Griffons lay eggs, not pegasi. Well, sometimes...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure how you expect Pelor to help you. Each of us is made the way we are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I can fix things myself, but I&#039;ve gotta power-up, use some whammy from my home dimension, and my friend Twilight figures the gods will get annoyed if we start throwing the heavy-duty bibbety-bobbity-boo around. So I figure, Pelor&#039;s the big good over-deity, right? If he gives us the okay, the rest of them won&#039;t cause a ruckus, well maybe the evil types, but buck &#039;em, I&#039;m on the side of good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You claim to have powers sufficient to bring the notice of the gods?&quot; Bessemer was recovering nicely. Whether this pegasus was telling the truth, or was just plain insane, this was far more interesting than paperwork. Besides, he thought he saw the hand of Pelor in this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well Twilight does, and she knows everything there is to know about magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You have a human wizard as a companion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wizard yes, human no. She&#039;s a unicorn, but last time we were in this plane she did a whole lot of adventuring as a wizard. I was a monk, got pretty good at it too. Obviously I worshipped Pelor, Kord too, I mean not in the going to temple every chance I got sort of way, but you know... I helped beat up evil and protect the innocent and be the best I could be, and all the stuff they say you should...&quot;</p><p class="double">The Bishop actually chuckled. &quot;I&#039;m sure Pelor is more interested in what&#039;s in you heart than on your lips.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great! So obviously I&#039;m not looking for a freebie here, what can I do to make this work? I&#039;ve got some gold to put towards good works and such...&quot;</p><p class="double">With the oddness of what had already happened, the idea that she had money too wasn&#039;t such a stretch, but he simply replied, &quot;I shall have to pray to Pelor for guidance on this matter, but I already have one idea. A paladin, Lady Salmara Melnor, holds vigil in the temple below, she is young and inexperienced, but she has already shown both courage and compassion in the service of Pelor. She seeks a mount to carry her on further adventures. A seasoned adventurer would be of great help to her. Would such a task interest you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash tried to rub her chin with a hoof, and winced because her bones didn&#039;t flex that way. &quot;A Paladin&#039;s mount? Yeah, I could go for that. It&#039;s not like we had anything planned... Aw man, I don&#039;t know if Twilight would go for it...&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a flash, and Twilight appeared. &quot;Dash, don&#039;t dash off like that... Oh, chlorophyll!&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to Bessemer. &quot;I&#039;m sorry sir, my friend gets a bit over-enthusiastic...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s fine. In fact, we were just discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. I believe you wish to use some abilities from your home plane that you are worried may cause issues with the gods. I would like to know more of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, wait a second, I thought you said using powers was a big no-no!&quot; Dash exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Teleport spell, it&#039;s only fourth circle, and unicorns can teleport without error inside their groves anyway. All in-loop abilities, so with a bit of tweaking and a Locate Person spell, I was good to go. But I guess I owe the good bishop an apology, and an explanation...&quot;</p><p class="double">A short explanation later on both sides, and the Bishop finished with. &quot;I will have to mediate and pray to Pelor for his advice, but I am sure he will give his blessings on those who use their abilities to aid his cause.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;C&#039;mon Twilight, it sounds like fun!&quot; Dash said, and Twilight considered the matter. &quot;I guess it would be something different. I never got to finish off studying the higher circle spells... if I could get access to various colleges and such as we travel around... Alright, I&#039;m in!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity fidgeted as Photo Finish snapped her pictures of Fluttershy. This could be her big break, but the intensity of the mare made it difficult for her to interpret her thoughts. The mare had her crew pack up the cameras and turned to leave–</p><p class="double">The door to the boutique burst open and Rarity could only watch in horror as her big break was barrelled over by the biggest tomboy in Ponyville. After a moment of confusion, the mare in question sat up, shook her head, and looked down at the unamused photographer. &quot;Oh! Glad to see I&#039;m not too late.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash!&quot; The fashionista trotted over, scandalized. &quot;What in Celestia&#039;s name do you think you&#039;re doing?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I heard my mom was in town.&quot; Dash got off Photo Finish and helped her up. &quot;And it&#039;s been a while since we&#039;ve talked, so I figured – Oh hey, mom, this is my friend Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ve haf met,&quot; Photo Finish stated dryly. &quot;It iz good to zee vu, mein blitzschlag, vut I vus on ze way to arrange for ziz quietschende schmetterling to be ze model in mein new line---&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Rarity said with a very forcibly calm face. &quot;I just want to clarify. Rainbow Dash is your daughter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ja.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; The unicorn nodded. &quot;Well, I must say she is a fine pony, although the fact she&#039;s related to you is... a tad surprising.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um...&quot; Fluttershy blushed from her stage. &quot;I, uh... I thought you knew already. I would have told you, but, um... well...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, me and mom...&quot; Rainbow rubbed the back of her head. &quot;We kind of move in different circles. But she&#039;s still my mother, so... yeah.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Only pony besides you to ever get me in a dress.&quot;</p><p class="double">Photo Finish&#039;s ears perked. &quot;Oh? Somevun else haz finally wrapped up mein kleine blitzschlag?&quot; She smiled slyly. &quot;Iz ziz vun your herz-knoten?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus gagged. &quot;Oh, ew! No. No, definitely no. Rarity&#039;s just a friend. Granted, she&#039;s a friend that managed to convince me to wear frills, but – just – no mom. Just no.&quot; She stuck out her tongue and crossed her eyes. &quot;Ew.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy giggled.</p><p class="double">Rarity finally managed to reassess the situation. &quot;Yes, quite. You would not believe the fuss I had to go through designing her gala dress!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ja, mein blitzschlag haz alvays been a fuss fuss...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And then she got my baby pictures out,&quot; Rainbow said, sipping her drink. &quot;I mean... Rarity&#039;s not Awake, all I was trying to do was do her a favour, but.... Eh, I can&#039;t really complain. I was awesome even as a foal.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rolled her eyes. &quot;That and Photo Finish really loves you.&quot; She raised an eyebrow. &quot;Does her being your mother happen... often?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well.... it&#039;s about one in ten. When I&#039;m awake, anyway. We&#039;re usually estranged.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....I am somehow far less surprised then I should be.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Girls, Ah have a very important announcement to make. Ah&#039;ve been workin&#039; on a secret project fer a while now, something that Ah think you&#039;ll like. Course, I kinda got stuck for a bit, but then Silver Spoon here helped me with some of her out-o-loop magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom paused, glancing at the silvery sea serpent standing next to her. &quot;Um... by tha way, why are you Steven&#039;s niece this time round?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As far as Twilight can figure, the Crash hit my identity code and knocked off the species marker.&quot; Silver shrugged awkwardly. &quot;The admins are probably getting around to fixing it, but it&#039;s not high on the priority list.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Okay.&quot; The earth pony flicked her tail and turned back to the other two crusaders. &quot;Anywho. This project started with lots o&#039; crossreferences. Evangelion, Transformers, tha Marvel fused loop, Twilight&#039;s Twibot thing–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The time you took me apart?&quot; Sweetie asked innocently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah only did that one time.&quot; Apple Bloom rolled her eyes. &quot;And ah put everythin&#039; back. But... yes. That did help a mite. And Silver here, miss Alchemist – even if it&#039;s not really alchemy like what we got here – she managed ta give me the final component. Girls, ya ready ta have yer minds blown?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo leaned back onto her pillow. &quot;Eh, sure. What you got?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned, taking off her necklace and putting it on the ground. &quot;Cookie? It&#039;s yer show now.&quot;</p><p class="double">For a moment, nothing happened. Then the gem in the necklace pulsed.</p><p class="double">Metal slats and squares began to unfold from a space outside space, pushing the necklace off the ground and raising it up. Panels slid across each other in a complicated, strangely familiar pattern. Metal pistons clicked into sockets and became covered by armor. Whirring and groaning reverberated throughout the clubhouse as the crusaders watched in growing awe.</p><p class="double">And with a final snap, a metal pony stood before them. Apple Bloom beamed. &quot;Fillies, may Ah present tha Robotic Armor and Partner mode fer intelligent devices.&quot; She grinned as two other necklaces manifested on the necks of the gaping fillies. &quot;Purely data, so Ah can transfer it right away <i>and</i> it carries between loops.&quot; A yellow hoof rapped against the pony&#039;s barrel. &quot;She&#039;s hollow too, in case we need a suit of powered armor in a jiffy.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Cookie?</i> flashed Clover hesitantly. <i>How... How do you feel?</i></p><p class="double">The metal pony shifted its head down. &quot;Sorry, this is still new to me. I&#039;ve barely gotten speaking down, but...&quot; She managed to decently mimic a smile. &quot;I can move. It&#039;s... it&#039;s amazing, really.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Well, I&#039;m sold,</i> flashed Pansy. <i>How soon till you have the pegasus model ready?</i></p><p class="double">Apple Bloom sighed. &quot;See, that&#039;s tha thing. Smart Cookie here doesn&#039;t even have Earth Pony magic, let alone pegasus or unicorn magic. Add to that tha difficulty she had in learning to move...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The fact is my kind of alchemy wasn&#039;t made for equestrian magic,&quot; Silver Spoon explained. &quot;I&#039;m... pretty sure I can fit it in eventually, but until then you&#039;ll just be pony shaped. And there&#039;s no real automatic processing, you have to control every joint manually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s like learning to walk all over again,&quot; Smart Cookie added. &quot;Pretty much literally, using bones and muscles that nopony had before. We&#039;d probably get it down in a few loops, but until then, we&#039;re just going to be clumsy animated suits of armor.&quot; She chuckled awkwardly. &quot;I&#039;m afraid to even lift my hoof because I could lose my balance...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>....still,</i> Clover mused. <i>It&#039;s a start. Mind if I assist you in your development of this project?</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m also ready to help,</i> Pansy offered quickly. <i>Although of course.... I wouldn&#039;t want to be seen as abandoning Scootaloo--</i></p><p class="double">The pegasus finally shook her head out of her amazement. &quot;Abandon? Pansy, I would never think that! You&#039;ve helped me a lot, you deserve this. If anything, I&#039;m willing to throw my hat in the ring too!&quot; She grinned. &quot;Maybe an expert pilot can figure out how to get these things in the air.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooo ooo ooo! If the magic&#039;s rune based it might be possible to interweave some musical notations in the spell for more flexibility and, uh, tactile senses!&quot; Sweetie hopped up. &quot;Count me in too!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.6 (Starfata)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright class.” Cheerilee began. “In light of recent events, I’ve decided we’re going to be taking it easy today.” Recent events being the beginning of her third loop, but her class clearly thought it meant the Summer Sun celebration. She waited a moment for their cheers to die down.</p><p class="double">“So, we’re moving on to Geography and Culture a few years earlier than usual.” She said, with a joking wink to calm down the more studious of the foals. “Today, we’re having a guest come in to answer questions about their home. Can anyone guess who it is?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle?” A young Apple Bloom raised her hoof- not the looping version, she hadn’t displayed any of the signs that the looping Sweetie Belle had taught her last loop.</p><p class="double">“Good guess, but no Apple Bloom.” She answered. “We’re not learning about Canterlot today.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara wasn’t looping either- the filly seemed so much crueller now that she had seen what the spoiled filly had the potential to become. Her hissed insult to Apple Bloom would have escaped her entirely in the original timeline.</p><p class="double">“Enough Tiara.” She said sharply. “If you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.”</p><p class="double">She glared at the filly until she settled down with a grumble. And she’d taken lessons from Fluttershy in her first loop. Impressive display of stubbornness from the child.</p><p class="double">“Alright. Any other guesses?” She asked again. Nopony raised their hoof this time, which she had already expected. That didn’t mean she wasn’t a little disappointed.</p><p class="double">“Nopony?” She asked anyway. There was a moment of awkward fidgeting before she smiled and called out. “Alright, you can come in now Zecora!”</p><p class="double">Her students gasped in horror as the Zebra walked in.</p><p class="double">Zecora ignored their reactions as regally as any Princess could, and bowed her head in greeting.</p><p class="double">“Good morning to you all on this day, I hope you listen to what I say.” The zebra began. “Though I live in the Everfree, my homeland is still dear to me. I’ll tell you the tales of where Zebra’s roam, Zebrica our heart and my own first home.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee smiled at her friend. This was going to be so much <i>fun</i>. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.7 (Stainless Steel Fox) (More Turning the Tables: necromantically raised plot thread edition)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they moved away from the clearing in the direction Prince Blueblood indicated and Zecora confirmed, they heard a voice from behind them, three voices. “Hey, wait for us!” “Big sis, I&#039;m coming too!” “Rainbow Dash, wait up!”</p><p class="double">The three not-yet Cutie Mark Crusaders were scrambling down from the deck of the wrecked airship, Scootaloo dropping down with her wings buzzing to slow her fall, and Apple Bloom simply leaping down, using her Timber wolf pup body to it&#039;s best advantage. Sweetie Belle had the most difficulty, hanging over the edge until Apple Bloom turned and climbed her front legs up the side of the airship to provide an improvised ramp. Each of them carried oversized and bulging saddlebags.</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. “And now we know why the weight calculations were off.”</p><p class="double">“Okay missy, you are in trouble!” Applejack told the mini-Timber Wolf. “I told you to stay behind, where it&#039;s safe!”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom cringed slightly, which looked odd on a vicious predator made of thorns and branches, but straightened up and looked her big sister in the eyes. It helped that even as a pup, she was the same height as a regular pony. She wasn&#039;t able to keep a slight quaver out of her voice, but there was determination there too.</p><p class="double">“I know I am, and I don&#039;t care if you ground me for a month, or even a year. You taught me family always sticks together, and that an Apple always pays her debts. Well I ain&#039;t going to let you two face that mean old Nightmare without me, and I got a debt to pay her myself for turning me into a walking tree! At least like this, I can help, really I can.”</p><p class="double">The last part was almost pleading, and accompanied by green glowing puppy-dog eyes.</p><p class="double">“Sweetie Belle! What do you think you were doing?” Rarity asked, equally acerbic. “And how did you get on the airship in the first place?”</p><p class="double">“We all met up underneath that table while we were hiding from Nightmare Moon, and we got talking afterwards, when everyone said you were going to go after her. I wanted to help too, and see you defeat that nasty Nightmare Moon. We helped with unloading the airship and managed to hide in the lockers in the cabin while every-pony was running around. We brought all the candy we could find.”</p><p class="double">“Candy?” The non-sequitur actually blunted Rarity&#039;s wrath.</p><p class="double">“Well, we sort of thought... Nightmare Moon likes candy so much she eats it rather than foals on Nightmare Night? Well we decided when you were fighting Nightmare Moon and she got an advantage and she was all, &#039;I have you now my little ponies! Mwahahaha!&#039; you might need a distraction so we&#039;d throw bags of candy at her and she&#039;d go &#039;Yum candy!&#039; and be all distracted and that would give you time to um... do whatever you&#039;re going to do!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a super-dooper plan!” exclaimed Pinkie Pie. “What? If some-pony threw bags of candy at me I&#039;d be totally distracted!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah! Not that Rainbow Dash needs a distraction to kick her flank all the way to Las Pegasus! I wasn&#039;t going to miss a chance to see Dash do something that awesome!” Scootaloo looked up at the hovering Dash with worshipful eyes.</p><p class="double">“Hey squirt, just because you&#039;re right doesn&#039;t mean this isn&#039;t some serious storm cloud we&#039;re heading into. We don&#039;t have time to babysit!” Dash was her usual tactful self. Then she saw how the word had crushed the orange pegasus filly and back-pedaled. “I mean we can&#039;t get distracted... we won&#039;t... oh horse-apples!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo looked ready to burst into tears and the others were all starting to put their own two bits in. As the babble rose, Twilight pushed out a low level muting spell and said, “We don&#039;t have time for an extended discussion! Every moment we delay, Nightmare Moon strengthens the bindings on Princess Celestia and frees more power to turn against us! I know the three of you meant well, but you&#039;ve put us in a difficult position. We have to decide what to do, and quickly.”</p><p class="double">She&#039;d already made a decision, having the three of them along should prove interesting, and she was sure of her ability to protect them, at least better than if they were out of sight. Now to justify it to the others.</p><p class="double">“Take them back, of course!” Rarity replied.</p><p class="double">“And lose all the time we&#039;ve made twice over? We&#039;d be too late. Splitting the party is out too, we needed everyone to defeat the last attack, and who knows what skills we&#039;ll need next.”</p><p class="double">“Couldn&#039;t you do that daylight thingie you did before and make this place safe?” asked Dash.</p><p class="double">“Between myself, Shining and Zecora, I&#039;m pretty sure I could, but considering the chaotic magic of the Forest and the Nightmare influence, it&#039;d need us here to sustain it for any length of time. I&#039;m sorry, but it seems the safest place for these three is with us.”</p><p class="double">She felt a slight twinge of conscience arguing this way, but the fact was that she&#039;d have argued exactly the same way from an in-loop perspective, quite apart from any meta-reasons. The plain fact that they were at hazard, and there was nothing to be done about that. Even a long-range teleport to carry them back was risky, because of the chaotic background magic levels. Doable if she went full alicorn, but she&#039;d already decided to use that only as a last resort. </p><p class="double">The three fillies looked ecstatic, and Applejack and Rarity close to mutiny. Twilight turned to them with a stern expression. “This isn&#039;t some sort of reward, and it isn&#039;t a game. If Nightmare Moon succeeds, that&#039;s it, all of Equestria is doomed. So you can&#039;t mess about! Stay close to your sisters and obey every order they give you without question! Is that understood?”</p><p class="double">“Um... but Miss Twilight, I don&#039;t have a sister....” Scootaloo offered nervously.</p><p class="double">Twilight mentally kicked herself, but didn&#039;t show it. “Rainbow, Scootaloo clearly looks up to you. Will you take care of her?”</p><p class="double">For a second, Rainbow actually looked frightened, then covered it up as she glanced down and saw the little pegasus looking up at her worshipfully. “Uh, I guess so... C&#039;mon kid, you&#039;re with me...”</p><p class="double">The sunshine in the pegasus&#039;s smile would have warded off even Nightmare Moon for a bit.</p><p class="double">“If all the drama has now past, we can be on our way at last!” Zecora said, moving ahead.</p><p class="double">As they forged on through the winding paths of the Everfree under Zecora&#039;s expert guidance, Applejack managed to ask Twilight, “Uh, Sugarcube, how did you know Scootaloo&#039;s name? I sure didn&#039;t recognise her.”</p><p class="double">Twilight deflected the awkward question with a shrug. “Someone pointed her out at the celebration – don&#039;t remember who. Rarity&#039;s sister too. Darn, now that&#039;s going to bug me for the rest of the day...”</p><p class="double">They continued for several minutes more, and then Zecora slowed down and started looking slightly confused. “I&#039;ve travelled these paths both near and far, but now I know not where we are. The way I came was right and true, but now I don&#039;t know what to do!”</p><p class="double">“No matter, I have kept a chart of our progress. I can easily find the right direction.” Blueblood boasted. He pulled a piece of parchment from a saddlebag and examined it, then frowned and turned it back and forth. His horn glowed, and then his eyes went derpy. “Ahhh! I don&#039;t know where I am!”</p><p class="double">“You and everyone else.” Dash snarked.</p><p class="double">“But I have absolute direction sense, it&#039;s part of my talent! I always know exactly where I am!”</p><p class="double">“Y&#039;know, that explains a lot...” Twilight murmured to Rarity, then lit up her own horn. “Ohhh, clever.... Shiny, can you sense that?”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour&#039;s eyes grew distant,, then he growled, “Illusion spell!”</p><p class="double">“A subtle one too, low powered, so well done even I didn&#039;t spot it until too late. Nightmare Moon&#039;s next attack, she&#039;s covered the entire area in a field that distorts our perceptions. If we can&#039;t find our way to the castle, we can&#039;t defeat her.”</p><p class="double">“But surely now you know it&#039;s there, you can counter it, darling, can&#039;t you?” Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">“I can try, but this thing could cover a huge area. If I don&#039;t get it all, it could flow back, warp things further. I&#039;ll try a wide area dispel as a last resort, but there&#039;s one thing we can try before that. An alicorn trumps unicorn magic, but she can&#039;t out-do the Elements, specifically the Element of Honesty. Applejack, you&#039;re the one pony who should be able to see past the illusion. Just concentrate on what&#039;s real, what&#039;s true.”</p><p class="double">“Uh... that&#039;s all very well, Twilight, but I don&#039;t know which way to go.”</p><p class="double">“But you can describe what you see, and that should give Zecora enough to go on. If we can just get moving, I should be able to start plotting the field strength and tell when we get near the edges.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re sure about this Twi?” Applejack asked. It was one thing to be told about her Element, and another to actually have to try and use it. And despite her honest desire to make things right with Zecora, it was still going to be odd working alongside the zebra after all the stories. Still, a pony had to do what a pony had to do. She walked up to the front of the party alongside Zecora, and focussed on the feeling she&#039;d had earlier when she&#039;d been listening to the zebra&#039;s story, judging it. </p><p class="double">At first she felt nothing, and then a warmth started burning in her chest. Her vision turned blurry for a moment, then she felt as if she was shaking off some sort of fine cloth. When her eyes could focus again, the scenery around her had changed, and there was the top edge of a large cliff running across their path. If they&#039;d kept on, they&#039;d have probably run right over it.</p><p class="double">She described what she could see around her in as much detail as possible, and it was clear from the others&#039; expressions that none of them were seeing anything like it. Zecora looked particularly puzzled. “I think I know where we&#039;ve come to, but how we got here I&#039;ve no clue. Bear to the left and follow the ledge, and have a care and avoid the edge!”</p><p class="double">They followed the earth-pony in single file into what appeared to be a massive thicket of sharply thorned brambles, but as they approached, it melted away to either side. It continued the same way, Applejack describing what she saw and Zecora telling her where to go. Barrier after barrier turned out to be nothing more than a phantasm, and every apparent path turned out to lead to disaster. Twilight&#039;s horn lit at intervals, and she muttered to herself.</p><p class="double">If she&#039;d gone full alicorn, she could probably have blasted the illusion away, but in-loop as a unicorn, what she&#039;d said was the truth. Besides, doing it this way was taking the focus off her and letting the others have a change to shine. Eventually the landscape started to match what Applejack was describing, as they emerged from the illusion.</p><p class="double">“Celestia, that was a sneaky one!” Shining Armour exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“And it&#039;ll get worse before it gets better.” Twilight sighed. “Princess Luna&#039;s domain was dreams, magic, and the night, and Nightmare Moon twisted all those things to evil purposes. She&#039;ll use mental attacks as much as physical ones. But as long as we stay together, we can beat her.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah! That old meany Moon can&#039;t stop us! We work together like cake and ice-cream... or ice-cream and more ice-cream, or ice-cream and chocolate, or candy-apples and hot sauce...”</p><p class="double">Everyone looked oddly at Pinkie, except for the three fillies who were glancing down at their saddlebags of candy. The pink pony just shrugged it off. “What! Those things are good!”</p><p class="double">Zecora held up a hoof, and hissed, “Beware you ponies, quiet now, for danger lurks beneath these boughs. A manticore lives within this range, to work around we must arrange.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood frowned. “But in that case, why bring us to this dreadful place?”</p><p class="double">“To foolishness do not give voice, this way would not have been my choice. Nightmare&#039;s spells took us astray, this path returns the quickest way.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour said, “Very well, we need to be ready. If you can fight melee, come to the front, non-combatants in the middle, magic users and ranged fighters to the back. Twilight, you shield to the rear, I&#039;ll take the front.”</p><p class="double">Alongside him lined up Big Mac and his sister, with Rainbow Dash flying overhead. Zecora came up with them, and so did Blueblood, just behind. Shining Armour asked the zebra if she was sure she wanted to be up front.</p><p class="double">“You still need me to be your guide, I can&#039;t exactly run and hide. If manticores we have to fix, this zebra has a few old tricks.” She gave a knowing grin.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s all well and good, but Blueblood?” Rainbow Dash asked, rather unkindly.</p><p class="double">“I may not be Royal Guard, but I am quite skilled at Polo.” Blueblood stated haughtily. </p><p class="double">“Polo?” Dash cackled.</p><p class="double">Blueblood plucked a cylinder from his designer saddlebags, which turned out to be the head of a Polo mallet. A flick and the shaft extended, and a ball followed it, floating up in the air above their heads. Blueblood gave a slight frown of concentration and the mallet blurred in an overhead circle that terminated in a double crack, the second of which was a tree branch snapping off neatly a hundred hooves away. “Polo.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shut her mouth, which had unaccountably dropped open, and she wasn&#039;t the only one. “Polo. Okay... works for me.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Rarity were at the back, and Twilight saw her friend was now looking at the Prince with a certain interest. She gave a small grin and a nudge to the white unicorn. “Thinking of taking up... polo?”</p><p class="double">“Huh... What?” Rarity shook her head slightly and said, “Oh nonsense Twilight, I was merely admiring his form.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I noticed that.” Really, this was too easy. </p><p class="double">“Oh, you!” Rarity blushed. “I just meant he does have a certain presence.”</p><p class="double">“Ohh! Does he have presents for all of us, or just Rarity?” Pinkie dropped back along side them in a manoeuvre that if it didn&#039;t violate the laws of physics, at least invited it out for dinner and a some heavy petting.</p><p class="double">“Pinkie dear, just drop it.” Rarity pleaded.</p><p class="double">“But I&#039;m not carrying anything! Well except for a couple of cakes, some party streamers, a dozen assorted balloons, a rubber chicken, an eye-patch, a ball, and a pair of fake Groucho spectacles. You know, the essentials.”</p><p class="double">The three fillies and Fluttershy were in the centre of the formation after some convincing by Dash that Scootaloo and Apple Bloom were forming &#039;a second line of defence&#039;.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle on the other hand was looking around nervously and asked Fluttershy. “This manticore, we won&#039;t run into it, will we? I mean with all these precautions, it&#039;s got to be pretty scary.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked none too confident herself, but she swallowed her fear and said, “Of course not Sweetie. Manticores need a large range to hunt in. The chances that it will be right on this edge of it&#039;s range, right in our path is...”</p><p class="double">There was a roar from up ahead. “... oh, my.”</p><p class="double">“Get ready, but stand firm every-pony!” Shining called out as the shadow of a manticore was silhouetted in the moonlight. “That means you too Rainbow Dash! Let it come to us if it&#039;s attacking! It can batter itself against my shield for a bit and then we&#039;ll see if it still wants to play.”</p><p class="double">His purple energy shield went up, creating a wall that covered the ponies out front. Blueblood raised his mallet, while Rainbow pawed the air and Applejack unslung her lasso. Big Mac just set himself, thorn claws digging deep in the dirt, and Zecora collected some powders from her saddlebags.</p><p class="double">They held there while the thing continued roaring and carrying on, but it didn&#039;t charge. Shining Armour asked Zecora, “Why isn&#039;t it attacking?” </p><p class="double">“I study such from far away, why acts it so I can not say.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow called out to it. “Well come on then, if you&#039;re coming!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy mumbled something, and Twilight, ready for it this time asked right away, “What was that Fluttershy?”</p><p class="double">It took several stutters and false starts, but she eventually managed, “I... I don&#039;t think it wants to attack us for being on it&#039;s range, I think it&#039;s hurt...”</p><p class="double">“So what do you suggest?” Twilight asked, as if she didn&#039;t know.</p><p class="double">“I could try and help it...”</p><p class="double">“Help it? Fluttershy, are you completely nuts?” Rainbow Dash called down.</p><p class="double">“N... no, completely terrified, but not nuts.” Fluttershy&#039;s voice steadied. “Please, he&#039;s in pain!”</p><p class="double">Shining had a sour expression. “I don&#039;t like sending any-pony in there alone...”</p><p class="double">Surprisingly, it was Big Macintosh who spoke up. “Begging your pardon sir, but every-pony knows Fluttershy&#039;s the best pony with animals. If she reckons she can do it, she can do it.”</p><p class="double">“So you think she can calm it down?”</p><p class="double">“Eyup!” The pony turned timber wolf nodded firmly.</p><p class="double">“Alright... but if that thing makes one wrong move, I want her hauled out of there fast. Twily, you cover that.”</p><p class="double">With that he opened a hole in his shield and Fluttershy walked forward. The manticore grew more frantic as she approached, but she trotted up to it without showing a trace of her earlier fear. She nudged it as it raised a paw as if to strike, and it instead showed the thorn in it. Looked like Nightmare Moon was running at least some old favourites.</p><p class="double">“Oh you poor kitty, you&#039;re just hurt. Now let me see that, this may sting, just a little...”</p><p class="double">It roared again as she plucked the thorn, and several ponies winced, but when they looked again it was cuddling her and licking her, making her mane an odd shape.</p><p class="double">It didn&#039;t attempt to attack or do anything as the party walked carefully past, and at the end Fluttershy finally untangled herself and rejoined the group.</p><p class="double">“Remarkable!” Shining Armour shook his head in honest amazement.</p><p class="double">“That were some mighty fine animal wrangling, Miss Fluttershy.” Big Macintosh added, and the butter yellow pegasus blushed, avoiding the big timber wolves gaze. “It was nothing, I just realised the poor thing needed a bit of kindness. Thank you for supporting me.”</p><p class="double">“My pleasure, miss.” He replied, and his eyes glowed with something more than a sickly green aura.</p><p class="double">Twilight was a bit surprised, after previous variations, it was a bit of a shock to see something following the base time-line. However, she made one change, when Fluttershy spit away the thorn, she captured it in a hoof sized ball of telekinetic energy just as it turned into smoke. She flashed the interior with intense sunlight and the smoke evaporated with a shriek. </p><p class="double">“That&#039;s one bit of Nightmare Moon that won&#039;t be reporting back on our progress.”</p><p class="double">They continued on deeper into the forest, and into the darkness. Clearly, as they&#039;d gotten closer to the castle, they were getting closer to the base-line route, and Nightmare Moon was doing the same. Which meant that she was likely to pull her old &#039;scary face&#039; routine next.</p><p class="double">As the darkness closed in Sweetie Belle quavered, “I can&#039;t see anything, I don&#039;t like this...”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom replied, “I can see just fine, just keep next to me, okay?”</p><p class="double">Twilight lit her horn, and the other unicorns quickly followed suit, while Zecora threw up some powder that formed a greenish light ball hovering over them. It didn&#039;t do much more than light their immediate area, and made the shadows beyond it deeper, but at least it was something. </p><p class="double">Of course, right on cue, the trees around them seemed to twist and reshape themselves into terrible faces with gaping mouths of needle sharp teeth and empty eyes that promised nothing but an eternity of terror and despair. They seemed to move without actually moving, the way the horror that chased you in your deepest nightmares did, and every second you delayed would only make it more terrible when they captured you.</p><p class="double">Twilight could have covered herself with a shield against the fear they were casting, but that would have been cheating, as in-loop Twilight couldn&#039;t. Instead she put her considerable mental ability towards resisting. The other ponies weren&#039;t so able.</p><p class="double">The fillies were cowering in the centre of the clearing, utterly immobilised, and the adult ponies around her were no better, even the normally imperturbable Blueblood who was curled up in a fetal position, whimpering, “Not the blancmange!” over and over. The only other pony still resisting was Zecora, and even she appeared to be weakening. Of course, there was one exception.</p><p class="double">As expected, it was Pinkie who broke the spell, trotting right up to the nearest face and making faces right back. If anything, the fear effect was even stronger than usual, and Twilight was the only one near enough to her right mind to ask her what she was doing, triggering her song.</p><p class="double">It was actually a fascinating study, watching the power of the Element of Laughter push away the fear effect, and soon she had all the ponies trotting around and joining in the fun. The fillies took a particular pleasure in laughing away the evil faces, but even Blueblood took his part, sneering at them and calling them &#039;tawdry, shallow hoof-paintings with no depth or sub-text.&#039; before laughing them into non-existence.</p><p class="double">When the last of them was cleared away, Applejack asked Twilight, “What the hey were they?!”</p><p class="double">“Images imbued with raw fear. I said we needed to expect mental attacks. If they hadn&#039;t been stopped, we could have been trapped here, immobilised with fear until it was too late. Fortunately we had Laughter on our side.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re welcome!” Pinkie said brightly, bouncing past wearing the groucho spectacles.</p><p class="double">Zecora shook her head. “Never have I felt such fear, it made my wits quite disappear.”</p><p class="double">“All the same, I&#039;d prefer it if you could figure out a way to stop that happening again, Twily.” Shining Armour asked.</p><p class="double">“Now I&#039;ve seen it in action, I should be able to counter-spell, at least enough to give us a chance to resist.”</p><p class="double">They soon reached the shores of the wide river, churning and frothing. “Horse-feathers, you ground pounders are never going to get across that!” Dash exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Can you teleport us in groups, Twily?” Shining Armour asked.</p><p class="double">“Not safely, not with the amount of chaotic magic in the air. We might end up in the middle of the river instead.”</p><p class="double">“Uh guys, we&#039;ve got a bigger problem...”</p><p class="double">Steven Magnet, the river serpent was heading downriver towards them at a rate of knots, but rather than bewailing his lost moustache, he was raging against the ones who had stolen it.</p><p class="double">“What the hay? We didn&#039;t do anything to his moustache!” cried out Applejack. </p><p class="double">Twilight was already casting magical scans. It seemed Nightmare Moon was playing cute again. “Nightmare Moon&#039;s cast another symbol on him, a Symbol of Wrath, but she&#039;s cast it on his eyes!”</p><p class="double">“So counter-spell it!” called out Shining Armour as he raised a shield to take the blow of a claw.</p><p class="double">“I will but I need every-pony to hold his head still so I can aim! Bring his head down to the ground!”</p><p class="double">Her telekinesis would have been enough, but that would have required going to a higher power than she wanted to risk, besides, casting the counter-spell at the same time would be awkward. Still, her purple energy wrapped around his head, joined by Rarity&#039;s and even Blueblood&#039;s. Shining was still doing shield duty. Fluttershy, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo formed a cheering section, albeit in Fluttershy&#039;s case a very quiet one. &#039;woo hoo!&#039;</p><p class="double">Rainbow landed on Steven&#039;s neck and tried to push him down, while Applejack launched her lasso, wrapping it around his muzzle. Apple Bloom and Big Macintosh grabbed the free end of the lasso and helped pull.down on it, but the river serpent was still resisting. Then Zecora whipped out a sling and whirled it around, launching a puffball at Steven&#039;s face. It exploded into fine powder, and seemed to stun the river serpent for a moment, enough time for the combined efforts of the ponies to pull his head down level with Twilight.</p><p class="double">She released her hold and fired the dispel charm right into his eyes. They glowed for a second, then lost their red tint, turning puzzled. The waters calmed as he stopped thrashing about. “Mi may, my moo Mi ma a mp mrnd my mummle.”</p><p class="double">Twilight signalled to Applejack to release the lasso, and the river serpent was free to speak. “My goodness, I don&#039;t know what came over me. There I was minding my own business, and suddenly this tacky little cloud comes past and rips of half my beautiful moustache clean off. Not only that but I was suddenly absolutely enraged!”</p><p class="double">He sniffled, “I&#039;m sorry if I scared you all, but I really wasn&#039;t myself. But my moustache is still absolutely ruined. I look absolutely horrid!”</p><p class="double">He started wailing, and the thrashing of his tail roiled the waters again.</p><p class="double">Dash looked incredulous “Really? Suck it up, you&#039;re a dragon!”</p><p class="double">“Dash, how can you be so callous!” Rarity exclaimed. “Look at his lovely luminescent scales, his expertly coiffed mane, even the fabulous manicure on his claws...”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s true, it&#039;s true...” The river serpent was calming down.</p><p class="double">“So much effort put into looking his best, and it&#039;s all ruined without his beautiful moustache.”</p><p class="double">That set Steven off again, worse than before. Rarity declaimed, “I can not let such a crime against fabulousity go uncorrected!” </p><p class="double">She plucked a scale from his skin, eliciting an ouch of pain and a query from the hapless dragon, and lifted it over her own tail...</p><p class="double">“STOP!” Blueblood stepped forward. “Miss Rarity, there&#039;s a shortage of perfect tails in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours. I find myself in agreement with you, this fashion crime can not go uncorrected. However, while gold and purple is a bold statement, wouldn&#039;t all gold be better?”</p><p class="double">Rarity was honestly shocked. “Prince Blueblood, are you offering what I think you are offering? Your tail is magnificent too. Are you really offering it as a replacement?”</p><p class="double">“It should be, I have the best stylists in Canterlot work on it daily.” Blueblood took a noble pose. “However, needs must, and you&#039;ve forgotten, I am <i>Prince</i> Blueblood, trend setter of the Canterlot social elite. If I can&#039;t make short tails for stallions the must have fashion of the season, I&#039;ll turn in my membership card for the Canterlot Country Club.”</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s eyes sparkled with unshed tears, and she lifted the scale, aiming carefully. Shick! A wave of gold dropped to the floor, to be caught by her telekinesis. The dragon had calmed down again fascinated at the drama unfolding below, and it was the work of a moment for Rarity to expertly weave the new gold into the existing stub so expertly it seemed a single set of whiskers.</p><p class="double">Steven examined himself and went into transports of delight. “My moustache, ohohohoho! It&#039;s back, and it&#039;s perfect!”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled up at him. “You look smashing.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is cool and all, but we really need to get across the river soonest!” Dash exclaimed with a huff.</p><p class="double">“Oh, allow me!” Steven laid his coils across the river forming a bridge. As they reached the other side, Rarity turned to Blueblood,eyes glowing warmly. “When we get back, I&#039;ll do my best to clean up that bob. I may not be a Canterlot stylist, but I can at least get it looking presentable. That was a truly noble thing you did, your highness.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, way to take one for the team, your highness-ship.” Applejack added.</p><p class="double">Shining Armour shook his head in disbelief. “I didn&#039;t think you had it in you.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood actually looked slightly embarrassed at the complements. “To be honest, neither did I.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.8 (Lord of Bones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the letter appeared in a flash of green flame and ash, Luna saw her sister reach out with her magic and undo the seal. Celestia unfurled the letter with a smile, which quickly turned into a look of incredulous astonishment, right before she vanished in a burst of purple light.</p><p class="double">Somewhat bemused by her sister&#039;s departure, the Night Princess levitated the letter over and read it out loud.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">You know I value the lessons you&#039;ve taught me over the years, but you simply must stop secluding yourself in that stuffy old throne room. Princess, there is more to life than bureaucracy, so I&#039;m inviting you over for the Ponyville Winter Wrap-up, and I have a more important task for you: make some friends.</p><p class="double">Your Student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">P.S. I expect a report on what you&#039;ve learned.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.9 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack eyed the necklace dubiously. If it hadn&#039;t been the glowing image of Celestia herself that&#039;d appeared to give her the thing - and done the same for four other mares in Ponyville - Applejack would&#039;ve assumed it was a prank. In horrible taste, no less, what with the whole <i>Nightmare Moon Is Real</i> thing going on.</p><p class="double">But the five of them had managed to get through the Everfree Forest with the power of these things, and now were facing the big bad alicorn herself. Using their necklaces separate hadn&#039;t done the trick, so where was only one thing left to do!</p><p class="double">&quot;C&#039;mon ya&#039;ll, let our powers combine!&quot; Applejack declared, &quot;EARTH!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;FIRE!&quot; Pinkie Pie exclaimed, confetti somehow firing from her mane and tail at the same time.</p><p class="double">&quot;WIND!&quot; Rainbow Dash cried.</p><p class="double">&quot;WATER!&quot; Rarity added.</p><p class="double">&quot;...um...Heart?&quot; Fluttershy offered.</p><p class="double">Their powers formed a glowing rainbow sphere in the air, and a purple alicorn princess in fancy dress flew out of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;By your powers combined...&quot; she announced, &quot;I am PRINCESS TWILIGHT!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and nopony else suspects a thing,&quot; Celestia said, grinning at her partner-in-crime, &quot;I certainly couldn&#039;t have pulled this off without you, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Glad I could help,&quot; Twilight replied, grinning back. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;AAAAAA!&quot; Babs shot out the door and galloped down the stairs. &quot;CHANGELING!&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom blinked. Then she glanced back at her wings and sighed. &quot;Ah have got ta stop ascending in mah sleep...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mayor Mare.&quot; The pony at the bar drained her mug. &quot;It&#039;s literally my name, Macintosh. Mayor. Mare. I mean, some loops I&#039;m also Ivory Scroll, but... well, that&#039;s the thing, isn&#039;t it? Every loop, I&#039;m stuck behind a desk and even knowing what&#039;s going to happen, even preparing for it, I get the same documents to sign, the same fiscal reports... I love this town, and I love running it, but the same thing over and over again feels...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pointless?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare nodded sadly. &quot;How can I serve ponies when.... it all just gets washed away. Phhhfft.&quot; She waved a hoof. &quot;And... really. I don&#039;t want to be famous. I just want to be... useful.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh nodded to himself. &quot;Ah can understand where yer coming from. But... think bout it like this. Mah lil&#039; sis usually sets up her lab ta do science of some sort or other. If she needed ta worry bout zoning permits, she&#039;d be champing her bit, but... well, she don&#039;t need to, thanks ta you. And there was that time when you and Twilight pulled off tha sovereign nation of Libraria... Ah don&#039;t know if you were awake then, but... Mah point is, we really do appreciate you. And tha fact is, we&#039;re all kinda responsible fer giving other loopers a place ta relax. We may not say it often, but.... well, Pinkie always pulls a party fer you every time tha election rolls round, and she means it as one big thank you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I.... appreciate that, Mac. I really do.&quot;</p><p class="double">He smiled. &quot;Say, did Ah ever tell ya about tha time Ah was a princess?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora was...</p><p class="double">Incensed? Perhaps. But it would be more accurate to say she was actually quite hurt by Ponyville&#039;s actions this day. Even though the Mayor had calmed the screaming crowd and insisted--with papers that the zebra didn&#039;t remember signing--that she was a fully licensed ranger, the odd suspicious glance still cut at her.</p><p class="double">The purple pony helping her shop smiled sympathetically. &quot;Hey, Zec, I know how it is. A lot of ponies look at me and only remember the town drunk.&quot; She shook her head, sighing and indicating another booth with a subtle hoof movement. &quot;At least all your friends are looping. Me, well... I have to live with my daughter... although, I did see my sister run off to Sweet Apple Acres, so she might have started.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am afraid you must forgive me, but your sibling eludes my memory.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheerilee,&quot; Berry Punch explained. &quot;The schoolteacher? We&#039;re estranged, but.... well, even when the loops say we aren&#039;t sisters, we usually have a past together.&quot; She cut herself off as the boothkeeper turned to them, and Zecora noticed the subtle shift in her face as she shifted from speaking to a looper to speaking to a normal pony. &quot;Excuse me, my friend needs some herbs? Here&#039;s a list.&quot;</p><p class="double">The boothkeeper raised a suspicious eyebrow. At least it wasn&#039;t fearful cowering. Still... although Zecora knew the pony couldn&#039;t remember everything that had... not happened yet, his distrust hurt.</p><p class="double">Berry noticed and patted her shoulder. &quot;Don&#039;t worry. Near as I can tell, everyone who&#039;s looping is Awake this time. I don&#039;t know why, but you can probably ask Fluttershy when she gets back. She lives closest to the Everfree, after all...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.13 (Lord of Bones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Your Highness? Have you seen our daughter?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s face fell as she turned from the distraught Bearers to meet Twilight Velvet and Night Light. The unicorn couple peered at her worriedly, and Celestia wished she had answers. Her faithful student had vanished after the dressing-down she&#039;d been given, and while Chrysalis had been unmasked – by a disoriented Blueblood, no less, who&#039;d botched a teleport and ended up in his cousin&#039;s prison – Twilight herself was nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="double">The familiar appearance of a Friendship Report drew a sigh of relief from the alicorn, which wasn&#039;t unnoticed by the smaller pair. Unfurling the scroll, she began to read out:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Dear Princess Celestia, </i></p><p class="double"><i>If you&#039;re reading this, I have gone evil-&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia just stared at the words numbly, as though in disbelief. &quot;I – <i>I have gone evil, possibly due to toying with eldritch arcane secrets beyond mortal comprehension or a brutal heartbreak at the hooves at the ponies I thought I could trust the most. </i></p><p class="double"><i>Following narrative tropes, I may have chosen to alter my name to something more evocative and ominous, like Dusk Eternal or Endless Eclipse. I will also have gathered allies, like corrupting Princess Luna into Nightmare Moon, breaking Discord&#039;s prison, stirring Sombra from his tomb and summoning Sunset Shimmer to serve as my lieutenant.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">There was a hitch in the Sun Princess&#039;s throat as she finished the sentence. Horrified looks were being exchanged between Twilight&#039;s friends and family, and the Alicorn forced herself to soldier on.</p><p class="double"><i>If Spike isn&#039;t there when you&#039;re reading this, he&#039;ll be with me as my final link to all that is good and pure about friendship, loyal to the end but curtailing my darkest moments. Also following narrative tropes, he may end up sacrificing himself to save my life from you or one of the girls-&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Rarity choked back a sob.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;The act of which would see me spiral deeper and deeper into my hatred and darkness as I numbly cradle the still body of my oldest and most faithful friend while you stare in horror. Undoubtedly, this will cause me to desire nothing more than the most terrible revenge imaginable, and so I&#039;ll confront you with Nightmare Moon and Sunset Shimmer, so that you can brood on the irony of being undone by your greatest failures.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your ex-faithful ex-student,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Endless Eclipse, Lady of the Twilight, Queen of the Dusk and the Dawn. </i></p><p class="double">The letter fell from Celestia&#039;s telekinetic grip as the Sunbringer stared numbly ahead. Twilight Velvet snatched the parchment and breathlessly read out the last few sentences.</p><p class="double"><i>P.S. If you&#039;ve received this letter and I&#039;m not evil...well, you&#039;ll know to take precautions, won&#039;t you?</i> </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>50.1 (Misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Look, Applejack, you can&#039;t remain scared of them forever,&quot; Twilight told her friend as they both casually ambled through the apple trees on a sunny Sunday day.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, Twi. It&#039;s just that I&#039;m a normal down-to-earth earth pony,&quot; the orange farm pony punctuated her statement with a hoof stomp, causing a small pillar of earth to jut out of the ground, &quot;and they are just so gosh darn plum loco!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not what I meant,&quot; the purple unicorn shook her head, &quot;I fairly sure Yggdrasil, the multi-verse, or whatever has a perverse sense of humor. It took me countless loops before I was over my fear of snakes, but until that happened, the loops kept doing things to me. I was placed in situations. Snakey situations.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath as she remembered, &quot;There was the time I was the archeologist Twilight Jones, a chakra ninja named Anko who had a snake summoning contract and used them in her martial arts, and a flight attendant on a airplane that was filling up of dangerous and venomous snakes. I think I finally broke out of my fear when I awoke as the Hogwarts basilisk.&quot;</p><p class="double">AJ stared at her friend and anchor, &quot;And how did that turn out?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, &quot;Well, despite the fact that those kinds of basilisks are actually legless lizards related to wyrms and not real snakes at all; once I calmed down from my endless freak out, I asked Harry in snake speak for a house elf to bring me some food. Then I, uh, sequestered myself in the library.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, figures,&quot; Applejack smirked.</p><p class="double">&quot;My point is that until you overcome this fear, you&#039;ll get placed in more and more compromising situations until you Awake as one of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack just shivered at the thought, &quot;But what do you recon I can do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well it isn&#039;t consistent, but occasionally in some loops - including this one, there is an expert I can introduce you to. If you&#039;re willing to wait until the changeling invasion, that is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose I can do that,&quot; the earth pony looked at her friend, &quot;Thanks, Twi. It&#039;s just that with the loops, I&#039;ve seen and done so much. I shouldn&#039;t be letting this bother me so much, but I just can&#039;t help it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, Applejack. It&#039;s what friends are for.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Listen every pony,&quot; Twilight stood on top of a small crate in the Ponyville train station. It was the day after she and her friends came back from Canterlot. &quot;I know you are all worried about the changelings. We stopped their invasion in the capitol, and we can deal with any remaining ones here. If it would make you all feel better, I can cast a spell that will reveal any hidden forms. If there are changelings hiding amongst you, you will see them. Okay, here goes.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a loud cheer as Twilight&#039;s horn lit up. A burst of magic enveloped the crowd and quickly spread out through the entire town.</p><p class="double">Only one pony&#039;s form changed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, kelp weed!&quot; Lyra Heartstrings cursed as the seapony flapped and floundered on the ground.</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s mouth opened in shock. The air noticeably dried as a sphere of water formed around Lyra&#039;s lower body and tail, growing until she was able to right herself.</p><p class="double">The sea-green seapony looked around at the assembled crowd members before her gaze stopped at a smiling Twilight and her friends. Only Applejack had a startled look on her face, &quot;Judging by your expressions, I&#039;m going to guess and say some of you haven&#039;t seen a mer-mare before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, every pony. I&#039;ve got this,&quot; Twilight said as she, her friends, and Lyra walked (or rode a water ball) into town.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Every pony was clustered in Lyra&#039;s house. For a few moments there was silence, before Lyra broke it, &quot;So, I suppose you have some questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie jumped up like a school filly with one hoof raised in the air, &quot;Oh! Oh me! My question is, do you like parties?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Pinkie. Especially your parties,&quot; Lyra answered without any pause.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay!&quot; the pink pony blew a noise maker and then promptly sat down, &quot;I&#039;m done.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nudged Applejack. The orange earth pony coughed and then asked, &quot;So, er.. You&#039;re a seapony. How in tarnation did that happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra rolled her eyes, &quot;Well, when a mommy mer-mare and a daddy sea-stallion like each other very much, and the daddy agrees to take care of the sea foals while the mommy goes out to fight...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not like that!&quot; Applejack snorted, &quot;I meant why were you here, in Ponyville, hiding out as a unicorn?&quot;</p><p class="double">The seapony sighed, &quot;Because I didn&#039;t want to constantly receive reactions like yours. I grew up in Oceanapollis, which is fairly close to the front lines. I decided that I liked music more than mayhem and had a sea-witch change me into a unicorn. Then I attended the Canterlot Royal Academy of Music specializing in lyres, harps, guitars, and stringed instruments. After that, I moved to Ponyville because it&#039;s not as mind-numbingly boring as the capitol. And I also met Bonbon here. So everything was coming up Lyra, right until Twilight&#039;s spell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! You went to CRAM? One of my little sisters went there. Or at least sometimes, she&#039;s my little sister. Hold on,&quot; Pinkie Pie tilted her head, remembering, &quot;Yep, Octavia&#039;s one of my sisters this time around.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight stopped staring at her random pink friend, &quot;Oh I get it! That&#039;s why you sometimes sit so strange. Because it reminds you of how you were aligned as a seapony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Lyra slowly shook her head, &quot;I have to sit like that to play the lyre. It&#039;s like stretching. If I don&#039;t do it frequently enough, it starts to become uncomfortable when I perform.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Pinkie said sadly, &quot;I thought it had something to do with your fascination with humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know about humans!?&quot; Lyra had a mad glint in her eyes while her tiny fins fluttered excitedly, &quot;Mythical technologically-advanced apes from another dimension? They have hands! They&#039;re like five little legs attached to one long leg!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what I said! Hand bump!&quot; Pinky spoke up and held out her hoof. A tendril of water shaped like a fist lightly impacted it.</p><p class="double">Lyra continued, &quot;I heard that there was a magic mirror that could let a pony enter the human dimension. Who knows what amazing mysteries lie beyond?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Boring, boring High School,&quot; Twilight said before her brain caught up with her mouth. She gave a sheepish smile as all the other ponies started staring at her, &quot;Uh, I mean, how did you convince a sea-witch to change your form? I&#039;ve read that they tend to be proud, manipulative, and stubborn.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra looked at her and slowly spoke, &quot;Because. I. Am. A. Seapony. Everything under the water is utterly terrified of us, hippocampi; or wants to kill us horribly. Usually both. I just asked nicely.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So you just asked?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I may have been casually tying her electric attack eels into balloon animal shapes while I was doing so, but yes. I just asked. And smiled.&quot; Lyra gave a wide, toothy, and very, very disturbing grin.</p><p class="double">Applejack whinnied slightly in fear, before reigning herself in.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have a question,&quot; Bonbon, who until now had been staring quietly at her roommate, spoke up, &quot;At which point did you think casually saying, &#039;Hey Bonbonbonbonbon, I&#039;m actually a seapony in disguise! What time is dinner?&#039; to be a valid way of letting me in on your secret?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See Applejack,&quot; Twilight said while the roommates were arguing, &quot;She&#039;s just like any other pony. Nothing to be scared of.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose so, Twi.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s why I&#039;m locking you in here for the night.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s fair I suppose,&quot; Applejack said while staring at the seapony, who had now grabbed her roommate in a water tendril and was holding her upside-down in mid-air. Bonbon didn&#039;t seem the least bit put out and just continued arguing right back while in her new position. Then Applejack suddenly registered what Twilight had said, &quot;Wait! What? No Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, AJ. It&#039;s called immersion therapy. See you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack tried to grab hold of the unicorn, but was too late as Twilight and all her friends vanished in a purple burst of light. She slowly looked back at the two ponies in the same room with her, who were now both staring at her. She gave a timid little wave. Lyra gave a matching wave with her little fin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now let me down so I can start cooking for three,&quot; Bonbon spoke up. She then blinked and gave a wry smile at Lyra, &quot;And I suppose I need to find you a stock pot or something to sleep in.&quot;</p><p class="double">The seapony blinked in realization, &quot;Ugh, I forgot to ask Twilight to change me back into a unicorn. So Applejack, you want to go on an undersea adventure with me to track down a sea-witch?&quot;</p><p class="double">The farm pony rapidly shook her head no. Then she stopped and spoke, &quot;I think I&#039;ll go help Bonbon with the cooking.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh fine,&quot; Lyra huffed. Then she took another look at the frightened farm pony and sighed, &quot;Do you want me to show you how to make the tastiest seaweed salad ever? Sliced apples are one of the ingredients.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack thought about it and then nodded. She was going to have to overcome her fear sometime and it looked like Lyra was making an effort to help her, &quot;I.. I&#039;d like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great!&quot; Lyra smiled as she rolled on her water-ball into the kitchen ahead of the earth pony, &quot;I&#039;m just glad you didn&#039;t ask if the Heartstrings part of my name refers to actual severed hearts.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack froze in mid-step, her ears laid back flat on her head and her eyes opened wide with fear.</p><p class="double">&quot;That was a joke,&quot; came a cheerful voice from the kitchen.</p><p class="double">Slowly, ever so slowly, Applejack put one hoof in front of the other and walked through the door. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Bonbon stormed into the library, slamming down a letter. &quot;Alright, how much to send this through your dragon?! Celestia&#039;s making a big mistake, and--&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Bonbon, check the hive mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony blinked, her rant completely derailed. &quot;Check the-- check... <i>you knew?!</i>&quot; She pointed at the librarian. &quot;You&#039;re one of them! You&#039;ve been feeding off Celestia for--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I&#039;m not a changeling. Just...&quot; The librarian facehooved. &quot;Just trust me, the truth is complicated and unbelievable and you really should check the hive mind.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;...You&#039;re brainwashed!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...<i>Celestia</i> is brain--!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bonbon sat down. &quot;I don&#039;t see how Chrysalis could have suddenly become reasonable! It must be some sort of trick--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Time loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Check the hive mind, okay? You can pull out and run if I&#039;m wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Bonbon stared off into the distance, Twilight prepared some sugary tea and set the tray out. It wasn&#039;t long before her guest snapped out of her trance and collapsed into the couch.</p><p class="double">&quot;....that... what?&quot; she managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re always surprised,&quot; Twilight commented. &quot;Well, at least when you&#039;re a changeling. No you&#039;re not looping and, well, the changeling thing varies too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I just...&quot; Bonbon waved a hoof. &quot;She just... and.... what? That doesn&#039;t work...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tea?&quot; The librarian nudged a cup forward. &quot;Oh, and since you are a changeling, you get free access to Macintosh&#039;s bar. Lots of changelings have trouble adjusting to the sudden shift.&quot; She giggled. &quot;Sorry, bad joke.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna trotted up to the statue of Discord, which crumbled as she approached. The dust reformed into a purple alicorn pony who waved a hoof in greeting, then gave the pedestal a very dirty look with glowing yellow eyes, causing it to regenerate a replacement statue out of sheer embarrassment. She cricked her neck and flexed her wings. &quot;Awakening as Discord, now there&#039;s something new.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Be there any other loopers present? My sister for certes not, but I may have missed some-pony.&quot; Luna looked around to check no-pony was near, even as her other senses confirmed it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, looks like it&#039;s just you and me.&quot; Twilight glanced up at the starlit sky. &quot;And unless you&#039;ve been rearranging things, I&#039;d say we&#039;re within a dozen years of your banishment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That doth check with mine own reading of the dates.&quot; Luna grinned, &quot;Not that I will allow it to happen this time. You have plans?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I thought I&#039;d hole up somewhere for a few centuries and give this chaos magic a thorough study. It&#039;s one thing to have studied it from the outside, another to have it to hoof. Of course, if you need anything, all you have to do is ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, good Twilight.&quot; The lunar mare grinned. &quot;However, I have a scheme of mine own. As it was before, my sister&#039;s day doth garner all the attention, while my night languishes unappreciated. This time, I have a better solution than throwing an epic temper tantrum and being banished to the moon...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The night had turned to day, by Royal decree, and the two princesses were enjoying a meal together, for Celestia it was breakfast, for Luna supper.</p><p class="double">Over the remains of a slice of cake, Celestia asked, &quot;Luna, I was wondering about some of the initiatives you are sponsoring through the Night Court. Funding for magical research into better light sources, later opening hours for taverns and theatres, and a series of art exhibitions and poetry commissions?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I&#039;m inviting a number of our more famous artists to render some of my night skies in their varying styles. I may even hazard a painting or two myself. My true canvas is unfortunately wiped clean with each dawn. T&#039;would be nice to have something less ephemeral. As for the funding, it comes from my own purse, so it should not be a charge on the treasury. I dids&#039;t capture and render down a metal rich asteroid of some hundred thousand tons to acquire the necessary precious metals.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But to what end?&quot; Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear sister, I know how busy the Day court gets, indeed that is part of the problem. Even so, surely you must be aware of a certain inequity in how day and night are perceived. Ponies appreciate your day, but for the most part they sleep through my night. While I also have my duties as Dream Guardian to keep my occupied, but over the last few decades I have come to feel diminished, as if my efforts were of less worth than your own. My Night Court is almost empty, while your overflows.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia made a moue of disgust. &quot;You can have them, some of the drivel I have to put up with from some nobles... But I had no idea you felt that way!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tis only recently that I was able to put the creeping malaise I felt into words. Had I continued to suffer it without respite, I don&#039;t know what would have happened. However, I have a solution. All these measures are to engage our subjects, to enable them to appreciate the night. Better light sources, cheaper and more powerful than beeswax candles and oil lamps or expensive mage lights, will give ponies greater freedom to thrive and play after your sun sets. Not just mages, but alchemists and even natural philosophers are involved. And of course, if we can promulgate those habits to the courts, I can help take more of the load off your shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;The other part of the equation is to give ponies things to do. If they can enjoy themselves of an evening, they will stay up later, and of necessity be awake to enjoy my night. While currently it will simply be a matter of enabling existing entertainments, I have the idea for something I call a Night Club. It would combine elements of a festival with musicians and dancing, combined with refreshments and places to eat and relax. Though I may sponsor some night-time festivals and provide meteor showers for a truly spectacular entertainment first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Despite the fact that she&#039;d planned it all out, she found herself getting excited. &quot;The arts I&#039;m funding will help raise awareness of my night sky, and hopefully get ponies to appreciate it more. I have a side project related to light research to develop better lenses and drafting methods, so I can try and popularise astronomy, beyond it&#039;s mundane uses in magic and alchemy...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled, &quot;My goodness, you certainly seem to have a lot of ideas...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The choice was simple, mope about it, or do something to change it.&quot; Luna replied with a flip of her ethereal mane. &quot;I hope it meets with your approval.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I wish you the best of luck.&quot; </p><p class="double">Luna knew her sister well enough to know that while honest, her sister didn&#039;t quite believe that it would be as easy as Luna had made it out to be, and she was right after a fashion. But Luna had one big advantage, she already knew what would work, and could guide things to progress things far more quickly than Celestia imagined. And if she kicked off an industrial revolution a few centuries early, so what? Then things would get really interesting. She gave an unfeigned yawn, &quot;But for now I must to bed. May your day go well, dear sister.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was late. She&#039;d gotten even more involved in her studies of chaos magic than expected, and completely missed the last few centuries, stuck away in a Geofront under the Macintosh mountains, where some of her more energetic experiments wouldn&#039;t scare anyone. She&#039;d had messages from Luna that things were going well, but they&#039;d been short on details. When she&#039;d finally checked the time, she realised she&#039;d missed her friends being born, and it was almost time for what would have been the thousandth Summer Sun Celebration after Luna&#039;s banishment in the original timeline.</p><p class="double">She teleported to the railroad near Ponyville, on a sunny afternoon, only to find it wasn&#039;t the normal twin tracks. A single rail floated above the ground on wide spaced cloud supports, and as she watched a mag-lev train whooshed past almost silently. Looking back towards Canterlot, she saw that as well as the familiar castle city, the lower parts of the mountain were built-up with sky-scrapers that were cunningly built into the rock to avoid ruining the sky-line.</p><p class="double">At least Ponyville looked much the same as she approached, and she could sense some of the others were Awake. She entered Sugar Cube corner in something of a daze, having seen Lyra in her usual spot, but editing what sounded like her lyre music on a thaumo-electronic laptop computer with a holo-projection screen. </p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight!&quot; Pinkie appeared in front of her with a cup-cake. &quot;Every-pony was wondering where you were!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m wondering where I am too!&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;Is the Summer Sun Celebration going on as usual?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, silly! Princess Celestia is coming to the Summer Sun Celebration, but Princess Luna can&#039;t make it, she&#039;s on the moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight felt a stab of disappointment. &quot;But I thought she&#039;d managed to avoid becoming Nightmare Moon this time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nighmare Moon?&quot; Pinkie Pie giggled. &quot;That&#039;s not why at all... c&#039;mon, it&#039;s time for sunset, it&#039;s easier to show you.&quot;</p><p class="double">They stepped outside to watch the sun go down, and Twilight noticed a number of small rectangles in the evening sky, light against the dusk. She sent out a magical probe to scan the sky... photo-thaumic power satellites, a string of them in orbit, and other satellites, with them, even a large space station with floating space-docks co-orbiting it. Then the moon rose, absent the shadow image of an alicorn, but with a scattering of stars inside its crescent.</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s dedicating the newest habitat dome at the Lunar colony in Mare Noctis, and then they&#039;ll do a joint holo-cast from Ponyville and the moon when they&#039;ll announce the launch date of the Celestial Voyager. Luna named it for her sister even though it was really Princess Luna&#039;s project. Dash has a place on the flight crew. They&#039;ll be visiting a dozen star systems this trip. I even baked a special &#039;You&#039;re going to go faster than light&#039; cake for them, but when I tried to carry it over to Dash&#039;s, I went a bit too fast and it attained infinite mass and vanished down a self-created singularity. I knew I&#039;d been too heavy on the unpaired quarks...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tuned Pinkie out as she stretched out her senses and enjoyed the view. Space industrialisation, Lunar colonies, interstellar travel, out far beyond the circle of fire light cast by Celestia&#039;s sun. It looked like Princess Luna might not be Nightmare Moon, but had her eternal night after all. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight would have sighed if she could.</p><p class="double">Her loop memories were vague fragments, but even worse was the fact that she was in complete sensory deprivation. She couldn&#039;t see, smell, hear, feel... even her magic was stymied, with only her connection to the Elements to tell her that her friends were Awake. She couldn&#039;t move, or rather... didn&#039;t feel anything <i>to</i> move. Which was really weird.</p><p class="double"><i>Buck this.</i> Twilight Sparkle summoned the element of magic and, relying mostly on faith, cast the spell for ascension.</p><p class="double">Instantly the world overwhelmed her with the cool touch of air, the light of the sun, the scents of grass and burnt out homes, the faint creaking of ruined wood... she shook her head, taking a moment to get her bearings and focus on the world around her.</p><p class="double">Which apparently consisted of posed skeletons in a half ruined Canterlot.</p><p class="double">&quot;....oooookay, this is... disturbing...&quot; Twilight poked out with her magic, carefully examining the skeletons; she winced when she found a soul-lock in each one, preventing the ponies inside from truly dying. &quot;Ah. Right. Going to have to apply regeneration magic-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Live? Alive!&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple alicorn spun around, catching sight of a wild-maned black pony hopping eagerly over the rubble. &quot;See?! See?! I told you, sister! I told you they would be alive, so HA!&quot; The crazed pony pointed mockingly at the largest of the skeletons, which Twilight belatedly realized had both wings and a horn. &quot;Ha ha. Ha. HA!&quot; She whirled around and grinned madly as she galloped over to Twilight, jamming her muzzle into the anchor&#039;s face. &quot;So pony pony pony, you come back because you like me right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled calmly, pulling on her psychology training and patting the pony in front of her. &quot;Of <i>course</i> I like you dear. I loved to look up at the stars every night-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the moon, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yes, the moon was one of my biggest inspirations!&quot; She sighed, sadly. &quot;Alas, dying does terrible things to memory. What exactly happened here?&quot;</p><p class="double">The black alicorn giggled. &quot;Made the ponies see my moon. Made it BIG! One night, really big moon. Oh, but I put it back after,&quot; she quickly reassured. &quot;And I even started raising the sun after sister fell asleep! Bad lazy sister. Bad.&quot; She sapped the large skeleton and glared. &quot;Mean too. Had all these ponies locked up and wanted them to send me away again – WAIT! You have the bad star!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes up to see what... Luna? Nightmare moon? Whoever she was was pointing at. &quot;Oh. I needed that to come back. I&#039;ll make it go away.&quot; She slipped the Element of Magic into her subspace pocket. &quot;See? Gone. Can I bring back the others now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...alright.&quot; The black alicorn backed up warily. &quot;Um... when you&#039;re done... can we play? I&#039;d like to play with another pony. These ponies don&#039;t play very well, except that one.&quot; She pointed at a wide-hipped earth pony skeleton with a larger grin then any other. &quot;That one always has fun games.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...sure thing. We&#039;ll... play.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.5 (LordofBones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;TWILIGHT SPARKLE!&quot; Celestia roared out. The guards, Bearers and her own nephew flinched back at the scorching heat of her anger, but the unicorn herself, who&#039;d just run in after vanishing the instant she entered Canterlot, was too busy wrestling Princess Cadance to the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike, the tranquillizers! HURRY!&quot;</p><p class="double">Gulping, the little dragon hurled the syringe towards his caretaker/sister-figure/business partner. Grabbing the Alicorn of Love in a headlock, the lavender mare seized the syringe in her telekinetic grip and jabbed it in. The pink alicorn shrieked, before her struggles began to die down as the chemical did its work, and soon the Queen of the Changelings was peacefully asleep on the floor of the room.</p><p class="double">Twilight brushed the sweat off her fringe. &quot;Well, that&#039;s the last one. Now, about my payment...&quot; She looked meaningfully at Blueblood.</p><p class="double">The Prince nodded and levitated the sealed envelope with his personal seal stamped on it over to Spike. &quot;A cheque for fifty thousand bits, plus expenses. Are you sure that&#039;s the last of them?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Bearer of Magic nodded. &quot;We cleaned them out pretty thoroughly. Make an appointment with Spike if you want me to do a second run through the place.&quot; She turned around, and jolted back at the look on her mentor&#039;s face. &quot;Princess Celestia, I didn&#039;t know you were there! I&#039;m really sorry, but I&#039;m kinda busy, so we&#039;ll have to catch up later.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s jaw opened and closed soundlessly, as her student, still faithful but no longer as reverential, levitated Spike over. &quot;What&#039;s next on the schedule?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s see...&quot; Spike flipped open a notebook and began reciting; &quot;You have an appointment in two hours with the Minotaur Council about some boats disappearing out the coast; then the Storm King of Griffonia wants to see you in the evening about getting rid of something haunting his youngest daughter; Grogar&#039;s offering two hundred thousand bits for the safe return of his Bell – that&#039;s tomorrow, by the way; and Zecora&#039;s hiring you for some ingredient hunting near Tartarus.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If we hurry, we can make it to the Tauros States in an hour!&quot; gasped Twilight as she ran out of the room, leaving her speechless friends and mentor. Blueblood shrugged and turned to leave. &quot;If there&#039;s nothing else...&quot; he trailed off as his guards opened the door for him, only for it to be shut tight again by a golden glow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nephew, what was all that about paying Twilight?&quot; Celestia demanded, too frazzled to be polite.</p><p class="double">In response, Blueblood simply rolled his eyes and levitated a small newspaper clipping over. &quot;Don&#039;t you read the papers, Auntie?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Sun Princess just stared at the advert, mouthing the words incredulously. &quot;Twilight Sparkle...Professional Troubleshooter...Monster Hunter...Ancient Evils...Adventurer...appointments with Spike the Dragon...fee doubled if usage of Element of Magic is required?!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.6 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight giggled as Spike sent off her follow-up letter. If the Princess didn&#039;t want her to take the Nightmare Moon prophecy seriously, who was she to argue?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">My apologies for having bothered you earlier. I clearly have been working too hard if I ended up turning a bunch of old pony tales into an imminent threat to Equestria. Obviously, if there was anything to the prophecy, you&#039;d have known it and spent the last few years doing everything in your power to prepare, from alicorn level magic binders to specially trained troops and equipment. You wouldn&#039;t need the help of a student unicorn who&#039;s still learning magic. Spike says I over-reacted again, and I guess he&#039;s right.</p><p class="double">Thank you for organising for me to be the overseer for the Summer Sun Celebration in Ponyville. A few days in the country, away from my studies will do wonders for my stress level. It was nice of you to arrange for me to stay at the library, but I promise not to read anything more taxing than a Daring Doo novel. As for making friends, I thought I had done. There&#039;s Spike, my brother and Princess Cadence, and I hope, if it&#039;s not too presumptuous, yourself. But if you feel I need more, I shall do my best.</p><p class="double">P.S. I had a wonderful idea! Moon dancer invited me to a party this evening in the West castle courtyard. I was going to continue work on deciphering the old legends, but I realised it would be perfect practice in making friends, for when I go to Ponyville tomorrow. Besides, I think Spike has a crush on Moondancer, and he deserves a chance to have some fun too. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll make sure everything is packed and ready so I can leave for Ponyville on time. From the list, it doesn&#039;t seem like checking on things will take that long anyway.</p><p class="double">Your faithful student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia looked at the letter in consternation. It seemed Twilight had taken her instructions a bit too much to heart. For a moment she considered intervening, then decided against it. As long as Twilight was there in Ponyville, she would quickly come to change her mind and go find the Elements. Best not to meddle and make things worse.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?&quot; Nightmare Moon declaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I did, and I know who you are... Princess Celestia. I know I got all over-excited about those mouldy old prophecies, but don&#039;t you think this is a bit over the top?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; the nightmare actually looked confused, then enraged. &quot;You dare confuse me with my sun-loving sister? I am Nightmare Moon, returned from my exile after a thousand years, and now my night will last forever!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;With all due respect your highness, this isn&#039;t really the time for Nightmare Night pranks. Ponies are waiting for you to raise the sun... unless it&#039;s Princess Cadence under that disguise, but I don&#039;t believe Cadence would pull something like this. But then I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d pull something like this. Everypony at the palace knows your fondness for practical jokes...&quot;</p><p class="double">She raised a shield as Nightmare Moon flung lightning at her. &quot;PRINCESS! What are you... that could have hurt some-pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am not Celestia! I am NIGHTMARE MOON!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight called out to the Mayor, &quot;Get every-pony clear. Princess Celestia has had some kind of mental breakdown. She thinks she&#039;s the pony from the legend of the Mare in the Moon, my dredging up of the old stories must have triggered something...&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor acted even as she spoke. &quot;Of course, but what will you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Try and contain her while you get ponies to safety!&quot; Twilight called out, letting a pair of thick anklets she&#039;d been wearing all day unlatch and drop to the floor. &quot;Guards, assist her!&quot;</p><p class="double">She flung out shields and counter spells to block and neutralise the energy blasts of the raging Nightmare Moon, while manoeuvring around to get a clear shot at her legs. When she did, the anklets shot forward to clamp themselves around Nightmare Moon&#039;s fore-hooves. Instantly, her ethereal mane diminished and the bolts she’d been throwing fizzled.</p><p class="double">&quot;What... what have you done!&quot; she asked, staggering.</p><p class="double">&quot;Slapped magic limiters on you until you calm down.&quot; Twilight replied. She blushed, &quot;I came up with them when I started having accidental bursts of higher power recently... They feed off power surges above a certain level, so the more powerful the magic you throw at them, the stronger they are. Right now you&#039;re limited to the power levels of a filly unicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the sun rose and Princess Celestia appeared, looking almost as confused as Nightmare Moon. Twilight looked back and forth, feigning confusion of her own. &quot;Wait, what... okay, what&#039;s really going on? Princess?&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia sighed. Things had just gotten complicated.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.7</p><p class="double">“Hiya, Twilight!” Applejack said cheerfully. “Got a moment?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Twilight sat down on a hay bale. “How are things?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you know, same as usual.” Applejack punctuated the comment with a sharp rap on the grass with her hoof, resulting in the nearby apple trees fruiting in seconds. “Just a simple farmer, me. And speakin&#039; of farming, ah&#039;ve got something for you t&#039; try.”</p><p class="double">She plonked down a bottle between them. “You know that potato project ah had goin&#039;?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“Well, this is after bein&#039; potato cider. Made th&#039; same way as regular cider is made, just... with potatoes. And then ah let some ferment fer a bit, just t&#039; see what happened.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked slightly apprehensive, but shrugged. “Well, I suppose that&#039;s the point of experiments.”</p><p class="double">“Good on yer.” Applejack took out two shot glasses, and filled them with a glug of liquid. “Health.”</p><p class="double">“Health,” Twilight parroted, and they both drank.</p><p class="double">“Ah, that hits the spot,” Applejack said, rolling it around her mouth. “Bit of earthiness, bit of tang – Twilight? You okay, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight finished a coughing fit. “Has it gone dark all of a sudden?”</p><p class="double">“Er... nope,” Applejack replied, confused.</p><p class="double">“Ah. Then it would appear I have gone blind.”</p><p class="double">The earth pony frowned at the bottle for a moment. “Ah well. Back to th&#039; drawing board.”</p><p class="double">“No, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some use for it. Just... not as a drink, except for ponies with a strong earth affinity.” Twilight stood, slowly and carefully. “I&#039;m going to go Ascend now, and fix my eyes. Er... which way&#039;s the barn?”</p><p class="double">Applejack pushed her shoulder gently. “Turn a bit... bit more... there.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Berry Punch blinked. “Okay, that&#039;s certainly an... interesting little number you&#039;ve got there, Applejack... I can really taste the solanine.”</p><p class="double">“The... ah, <i>hay</i>.” Applejack kicked the floor. “Now ah know what ah forgot. Y&#039;all gonna be fine?”</p><p class="double">The drinks-mare gulped, shook her head, and belched a cloud of green smoke which brought with it an earthy tang. “Yeah, I&#039;ll be fine. My tolerance is positively <i>metaphysical.</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora put down her retort, in which a testing potion was hissing alarmingly as the drops of potato cider fell into it.</p><p class="double">“My apologies, fair mare of earth. I fear I have no use for this poisonous beer.”</p><p class="double">“What, none? Not even in a potion?”</p><p class="double">“I said none, Applejack, and I meant it. If you think there is a way, invent it.”</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed. “Okay. Thanks anyway, Zecora.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Flame shot out of Spike&#039;s ears and nose.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Peewee was induced to try some, he promptly exploded. The adult phoenix which reformed from the cloud of smoke and feathers looked mildly peeved.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I see.” Discord downed the glass.</p><p class="double">Then caught fire.</p><p class="double">“I like it,” he pronounced, licking his claws and using them to extinguish his burning beard. The rest of him, he just left on fire.</p><p class="double">“What, really?” Applejack blinked. “I plumb didn&#039;t think anyone would. Well, you&#039;ll have t&#039; fight over it with Applebloom.”</p><p class="double">Discord looked intrigued. “What does she do with it?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom grabbed a spanner, and used it to tighten a couple of bolts on the quad-cycle she was working on.</p><p class="double">“Ah, fiddlesticks...” she muttered, blipping the throttle to no response. “Somethin&#039;s blocking up the fuel line.”</p><p class="double">She picked up a small jar of potato cider, and dribbled a few drops into the engine tank before trying again. This time, it picked up beautifully.</p><p class="double">“Best all-natural engine lubricant ah&#039;ve seen in a while,” she pronounced. “Hmmm... wonder if ah might try that all-wood an&#039; plant products car project again...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.8 (Richardson)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Rainbow Dash! There are plenty of things you can do in the hospital!&quot; Twilight cheerfully remarked as she rummaged through the hospital book cart. She knew it had to- Ah-HA! It was always wonderful to watch Dash fall in love with books whenever the mare wasn&#039;t Awake. It just felt right to add- err, enraptured another with the wonders of reading. &quot;Here, try reading this! It has everything, traps, adventure, ancient mysteries!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Jack Sparrow and the Sapphire Stone?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s mind crashed to a halt that some would say could be heard all the way in the world tree itself. &quot;What the bark?!&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Ya okay, sugarcube? Ya went really pale just then.&quot; Applejack asked as the farm mare came up beside her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, I just thought of something, that&#039;s all. Oh, by the way, Dash, there is something else. The events of the book actually happened. He actually exists, and the book is a way for him to make enough money to survive off of. Adventuring for a living doesn&#039;t pay well. He just publishes it under a pseudonym. &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? No way!&quot; Dash looked at her book in a new light and her eyes lit up as she looked over the grimy and tussled protagonist emblazoned on the cover. &quot;This guy is for real?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! He goes on way more adventures than us, but even I don&#039;t know how to find him. Maybe he&#039;ll come through the area looking for an ancient treasure, though. It&#039;s fun to read!&quot; Twilight looked to the door, wondering when she could get away to have a long talk with a certain looped</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hey! &#039;Guest starring Commander Cane, The HERO OF EQUESRIA&#039;. He&#039;s real, too? I thought he was just propaganda put out by the Guard!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight ran for the door as urgency struck her. Either one of the two was enough to cause a rough loop. Both of them, together!? &quot;Be back later, girls! I have to go water my tree, &#039;kaythanksbye!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s eatin&#039; her apple?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No idea. Hey! This actually is pretty good!&quot;</p><p class="double">Of course, if Twilight had any inkling of what she had been about to stumble into, she would have stayed home and hidden herself within a great fortress of books... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee and Zecora almost – <i>almost</i><i> – </i>shared a birthday.</p><p class="double">It was a weird cosmic coincidence, honestly. In fact, it was one of the few stable elements of the loop – which, as Twilight pointed out, was really strange. True, the dates of their birth would slide up and down the calendar like any other Looper&#039;s, but Zecora&#039;s birthday was always the day before Cheerilee&#039;s.</p><p class="double">The fact that they had started looping together only compounded their friendship. Well... almost started looping together.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, it... it turns out that Liz! The lizard! She was the anchor for the loop.&quot; Cheerilee snorted as she threw back another mug. &quot;Heh. She gave me, blue, blueprints for the bus, after I told her what Harry had told me about the loops back in Hogwarts. Liz the Lizard.&quot; She giggled.</p><p class="double">&quot;The phrasing is amusing, that is true.&quot; Zecora waved a hoof in a broad arc. &quot;Like Rainbow Dash... something something blue!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Something something blue?&quot; The earth pony nudged the zebra with a grin. &quot;You are totally drunk!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I may be intoxicated, but at least I&#039;m not <i>domesticated.</i>&quot; Zecora shot a sly grin at Cheerilee, waggling her eyebrows.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no no no. Not the Pony thing.&quot; The schoolteacher pointed. &quot;There are! Are worlds out there where ponies roam free and, and people ride zebras! I know it! I&#039;ve never been to one but, but...&quot; She sighed. &quot;Why did I start out with fused loops, Zeccy...? I don&#039;t understand.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fate works in mysterious ways,&quot; the alchemist intoned sombrely. &quot;Especially in repeating days. But the fact is that you&#039;re here now and let&#039;s not bother with the whys or hows. It&#039;s our midnight drinking bash! Take a tablecloth and make a sash!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m not quite drunk enough for that yet.... MAC! More booze, no love poison!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.10</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...alright,” Mayor Mare sighed. “You can give it a go. No use of pegasus magic or wings, Dash, neither of you are to Ascend – it&#039;s a pain handling the press – and you&#039;re not going on the leaderboard.”</p><p class="double">Dash and AJ exchanged glances. “Buck yeah!”</p><p class="double">“Just what ah was thinkin&#039;, <i>crash.</i>”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s SO on,” Dash pronounced. “You know how on it was before? It&#039;s more on now.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Go!”</p><p class="double">Dash launched herself forward, blowing leaves every which way as she shot out ahead of the rest of the herd.</p><p class="double">Sure, AJ was fit. Sure, everypony including Berry had beaten them the first time because they had been so focused on fowl play. But Dash&#039;s thing was <i>speed</i>. Even with her wings bound and no magic, Dash had far more experience as an athlete than Applejack did.</p><p class="double">“Coo-ee!”</p><p class="double">Dash blinked. “What?”</p><p class="double">With a rumbling roar, Applejack surfed past.</p><p class="double">She was running at a little more than half the speed that Dash was. And the ground she was running <i>on</i> was moving, independently, at a little more than half the speed Dash was.</p><p class="double">“Aw, come <i>on!</i>” Dash shouted. “That&#039;s <i>so</i> cheating!”</p><p class="double">“Rules don&#039;t say nothing about Earthbendin&#039;,” Applejack replied cheerfully. “Guess you&#039;re plumb out of luck, huh?”</p><p class="double">“Like hay!” Dash dug deep, focusing on her training, and accelerated.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, AJ?” Dash called. “I had a loop where I was something called a Rapidash.”</p><p class="double">“So?” Applejack replied, still working her artificial landsurf.</p><p class="double">“<i>Agility.</i>”</p><p class="double">A blue blur caught up to Applejack, and resolved into Dash. “Hey. I&#039;ve not done much foot racing recently, but... don&#039;t you think we should be going a bit faster?”</p><p class="double">With that, Dash accelerated away.</p><p class="double">“Tarnation.” Applejack scowled. “Right. No more missy nice pony.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twin blurs of motion shot past the finish line.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, how&#039;d we do?” Dash asked the photographer.</p><p class="double">“Vell...” Photo Finish shrugged. “It is, as zey say, appropriate that you asked me, little stormcloud.”</p><p class="double">She held up the photo. It showed both of them exactly in line as they passed the posts.</p><p class="double">“Ah...” Applejack searched for something to say. “Laurel.”</p><p class="double">“You have got to be kidding.” Dash gaped. “Dead heat?”</p><p class="double">“Ja.” Finish shrugged. “Now, I go.”</p><p class="double">She vanished in a blur.</p><p class="double">“Wait a sec,” Applejack said, looking after her. “...she your mother again?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.”</p><p class="double">“Ah see where y&#039;all get th&#039; speed, now...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.11 (Anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was not very happy with this loop.</p><p class="double">The grim city that had replaced Canterlot was overshadowed by a bright, white building that was much less pleasing to look at than Celestia&#039;s palace. From her position in an empty, overgrown lot that should have been the park beside the School For Gifted Unicorns, Twilight Sparkle could see three lines of text carved into the wall in large letters, though the angle wasn&#039;t right for her to read them.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t need to, because the slogan beneath the poster of a bearded crimson male alicorn pasted on the wall of a nondescript warehouse across the street from her was all she needed to identify what the basis for this fused Loop was. (Twilight desperately hoped that there were no Loopers native to that universe.)</p><p class="double">Fortunately, she was not completely alone this time. Only one Element was Awake, but she was exactly the pony Twilight needed, and she was standing right beside her. “Pinkamena Diane Pie,” she said seriously.</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight?” the other mare replied.</p><p class="double">“You know all those things I ask you not to do normally?” Twilight asked. “<i>Do </i>them.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie blinked. “You sure, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m completely serious.” Twilight smiled slightly. “Don&#039;t do anything that&#039;ll get me an angry eight-legged visitor next Loop, but other than that, do your worst. Go full Chaos Goddess. Liven this place up.”</p><p class="double">There was a bright pink light, and Pinkie ascended, her body swelling a moment later to a stature only slightly smaller than baseline Celestia. The Element around her neck was dim for a moment, then began to shine. She looked down at Twilight. “Are you coming?”</p><p class="double">Twilight summoned her own element and ascended, but she still shook her head. “No,” she said, “I think I&#039;ll just go... study the moons of the outer planets while you do your thing. I&#039;ll check back with you in about a year, okay?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded, rising into the air with two powerful beats of her wings. She brought her forehooves together, somehow making a popping noise like she was cracking non-existent knuckles and turning her attention back to the poster across the street.</p><p class="double">Twilight followed her gaze, reading the slogan one last time. <i>BIG STALLION IS WATCHING YOU</i>. “Have fun,” she told her friend, opening a small portal.</p><p class="double">“I <i><b>will</b></i>,” she promised, her horn glowing.</p><p class="double">Twilight was fairly certain that she closed the portal behind herself just in time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Twilight came back, she was surprised by what she saw. The once-overgrown lot was now again a well-maintained park, though one smaller than the baseline version. The city, from what she could see from her own position, was perhaps a bit brighter, but still recognizable from what she&#039;d briefly seen before setting Pinkie loose. The same white building stood over the city, and there was still a poster on the wall across the street.</p><p class="double">Though it was now a poster of a female, pink alicorn. “Friend Pinkie Is Watching You,” Twilight read, more than a little perplexed, and then she saw a smaller line of text underneath the slogan. She squinted her eyes, read, “But Only When It&#039;s Not Creepy,” and then smiled slightly.</p><p class="double">The park was empty, but a moment later two earth pony stallions galloped down the street, skidding to a halt when they saw Twilight. She realized that she hadn&#039;t reverted back to a unicorn and opened her mouth to try to explain, but one of the two interrupted Twilight before she could begin.</p><p class="double">“Hey, didn&#039;t you hear?” he asked. “Miniboredom is throwing a doubleplussuperawesome party and <i>everypony</i> is invited! You don&#039;t want to miss it!” Without waiting for an answer, the pair raced off.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared after them for a moment, then with a shrug took to the air and followed them. It probably <i>would</i> be a fun party. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Girls? Can we talk?&quot;</p><p class="double">The cutie mark crusaders looked up from their starfighter blueprints and smiled at their... well, former teacher.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure thing, miss Cheerilee!&quot; Scootaloo rolled up her own plans. &quot;Not like there&#039;s anything here I don&#039;t know already.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, Scoots, Ah&#039;m pretty sure Ah&#039;ll surprise ya once Ah&#039;m done.&quot; Apple Bloom slid her own sketches to the side.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle shrugged. &quot;Honestly, I&#039;m waiting for Tiara to get her, she understands this better. So... what&#039;s got you down?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee took a moment to mentally readjust herself. Even knowing that these fillies were technically older then the princesses... in their own way... it still took some effort to deal with them as equals. &quot;It&#039;s just... well... I&#039;m a teacher and...&quot; She sighed, sitting down. &quot;Well...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nopony else is learning?&quot; Scootaloo suggested. &quot;Nopony besides us, Diamond, and Nyx?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t forget Silver Spoon,&quot; Sweetie pointed out. &quot;She&#039;s looping now too.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare shook her head with a melancholy smile. &quot;Got it in one. And... I can&#039;t even teach you all properly, you&#039;ve already... learned so much.&quot; Cheerilee&#039;s eyes drifted skyward, watching the clouds meander by. &quot;The first few loops back at home I tried... I did what I usually do, and... well... now it&#039;s beginning to wear on me. I...&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom nodded. &quot;Ah&#039;m pretty sure Ah get where you&#039;re coming from. It&#039;s hard ta carry tech between loops, and that means lots of rebuilding based on what Ah know just ta get back ta inventing. You&#039;ve got it worse since your thing is tied up with nonloopers...&quot; She tapped her chin thoughtfully. &quot;...What if... what if ya spent a few loops teaching somewhere else? Like Fillydelphia or... tha Crystal Empire, actually, that could be good. And tutoring Silver during tha loops should be a mutually beneficial thing...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s also the &#039;multiple interpretation&#039; thing cutie marks have,&quot; Sweetie pointed out. &quot;You could take up gardening! Or... terraforming!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And we&#039;d always be ready to learn something from fused loops we haven&#039;t been to!&quot; Scootaloo added. &quot;Just think, you could have your own private lecture hall!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee giggled at the pegasus&#039;s enthusiasm. &quot;...Thanks. I... I guess I should try those things out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re welcome.&quot; Apple Bloom grinned. &quot;Oh, and by the way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS GROUP GLOMP YAY!&quot;</b> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.13 (LordofBones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike gulped at the expressionless look on Twilight&#039;s face as he confessed his desire to meet his own kind, even after the disaster that had been the Garble incident. The unicorn seized him in her telekinetic grip and marched out towards the Everfree, and for a moment the little dragon felt that old terror that he was going to be abandoned by his best friend. Twilight didn&#039;t bother looking at him, but simply marched onwards, deeper and deeper into the Everfree, until they stood at the mouth of a cave. </p><p class="double">Then Twilight walked in. </p><p class="double">The cave opened up into a large complex built into an open-topped mountain, and it was filled with <i>dragons. </i>Huge wyrms with purple, blue, black, red scales held court with fascinated younger drakes; a giggling young dragoness was leading an interested cyan male on a merry flight; several couples waited at the alcoves, tails entwined lovingly, as they watched their children play; a sinuous green was muttering to itself and comparing long sheaves of parchment with a grizzled white and a dignified blue. Hot springs dotted the huge cavern, with half-asleep dragons simply relaxing in the waters.</p><p class="double">And everything came to a screeching stop when Twilight walked in, most faithful assistant in tow. </p><p class="double">The lavender unicorn noticed Garble and his lackeys immediately. True to form, the sneering trio immediately lunged, claws and fire at the ready, and were smacked away like rag dolls by a huge azure-scaled tail. A behemoth with gigantic wings rose from the darkest shadows of the mountain and strode forward, its footsteps created small earthquakes with each passing. Fearlessly, Twilight met the cold, crimson gaze and said something in a low, deep language that Spike had never heard before. </p><p class="double">The monster halted in its tracks and stared. Those penetrating red eyes grew large in disbelief, and a voice that sounded like mountains grinding boomed across the complex. <i>&quot;Where did you learn the language of the First and Last, horse?&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I read a lot,&quot; Twilight shot back snarkily. </p><p class="double">Gasps rose from their draconic audience. Spike shut his eyes and prayed that Twilight hadn&#039;t just snarked at a dragon thrice the size of the library.</p><p class="double">The wyrm threw back his horned head and <i>roared </i>with laughter. The laugh was surprisingly warm and pleasant, even if it rattled the floating drake&#039;s bones, and when it finally stopped, the visibly amused winged serpent nodded. <i>&quot;Very well, proceed.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Twilight bowed respectfully and gently set Spike down. &quot;Hello everydragon, my name is Twilight Sparkle, student of Celestia Sunbringer and Bearer of the Element of Magic. This is Spike, my faithful assistant, helper and little brother!&quot; </p><p class="double">The little dragon&#039;s eyes went huge at the announcement, and through his joy at Twilight&#039;s words he noticed that every eye was fixed on him. </p><p class="double">&quot;Through the years I&#039;ve known him, Spike has stood alongside me against the Eternal Ever-Changing Serpent himself, as well as the power that drove Luna Dreamwalker to madness, and he did so because <i>his friends were in danger!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Murmurs rose from the crowd as they looked at each other and back at the blushing drake. </p><p class="double">&quot;In addition to that, Spike is an excellent chef, gemhunter, jeweller, musician, actor, emcee and accountant! He has ties with the Equestrian Crown and the elite of Equestria! Dragonesses and drakes, <i>he even cleans up after himself!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">An appreciative &quot;oooh&quot; went up from the audience. Twilight heard one dragoness comment to her friend, &quot;That&#039;s just what we need, you know? None of these macho fire-breathers; we want someone who can run a household and manage the hoard responsibly.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;But, alas, Spike is an orphan. Nopony, not even Celestia herself, knows who his parents are. He knows nothing about his people, his culture, his history. In fact, thanks to three young drakes, he believes that his people <i>murder babies! He is terrified of being a monster, because three of you sullied all of dragonkind before an impressionable, lonely CHILD!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Was it worth it?!&quot; </i>Twilight spat, stalking closer towards a dazed Garble as the dragons roared and screeched in outrage. <i>&quot;Was it worth crushing the dreams of an orphan, just so you could get your jollies off? Was it worth forcing Spike to think that dragonkind murder unborn children in front of their parents for ENTERTAINMENT?! </i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; </i>boomed the azure titan. A triad of nervous dragons snatched the trio and backed off at the furious look on the patriarch&#039;s face. <i>&quot;I&#039;ll deal with you three after this!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I implore you, dragons of the Everfree. I implore you, please, teach my little brother, because I cannot,&quot; Twilight ended with a whisper. She kissed Spike&#039;s crest and backed away. </p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot; Spike&#039;s voice was tiny. </p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll be back in a week, Spike. I promise. Have fun,&quot; she smiled at him as she trotted away, making sure to keep the young dragon in her sights until she heard wingbeats. A young dragoness with a startling resemblance to Rarity scooped the surprised drake up and cuddled him, followed by several others. </p><p class="double">&quot;Look at these adorable cuddly cheeks!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t hog him!&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Sing for us, cutie!&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Look, he&#039;s blushing! Isn&#039;t that just sweet?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.14 (SpaceKGreen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee smiled as she looked over her class. Her students were diligently working on their schoolwork, and she had a bit of time to herself.</p><p class="double">The Loop had been quiet so far; Nyx was Awake, so the Nightmare Moon situation hadn&#039;t occurred, and Twilight had headed off most of the other usual Ponyville crises. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon (surprisingly an Earth Pony this loop) were also Awake, so she hadn&#039;t had to deal with their bullying either.</p><p class="double">There was a sudden commotion outside, and Cheerilee frowned, as the children craned their necks trying to look out the windows. This was new; normally this was a quiet week...</p><p class="double">The schoolhouse door burst open, and a large pony made of black crystal, shedding drops of dark magic, strode in. Fanged jaws parted open, and a terrifying voice boomed forth.</p><p class="double">&quot;HEAR NOW AND OBEY. THE DARK KING SOMBRA IS NOW YOUR LORD AND MASTER. ALL SLAVES ARE TO-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me!&quot;</p><p class="double">The crystal golem paused. It took in the classroom; the children were riveted to their seats, wide eyes staring at both the golem and the teacher, who was currently glaring at the intruder.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know WHAT you were thinking, but class is currently in session! If you wish to talk, you can wait outside for class to end.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;QUIET SLAVE. YOU SHALL GATHER THESE BRATS AND-&quot;</p><p class="double">The golem was interrupted as the teacher seemed to flicker, and a piece of chalk bounced off its head hard enough to rattle its crystalline brain.</p><p class="double">&quot;I SAID, class is in SESSION right now!&quot; growled Cheerilee. &quot;Wait OUTSIDE, and I will get to you AFTER CLASS.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOU STUPID SLAVE. RESISTANCE WILL BE MET WITH DEATH.&quot; the golem boomed, as it strode towards Cheerilee menacingly, the dark magic dripping from its body having increased to a torrent. &quot;YOU AND ALL THESE BRATS SHALL-&quot;</p><p class="double">Again it was interrupted, this time as an eraser hit it hard enough to carry it out through the door and across the road.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee sighed, feeling the stares of the students on her. &quot;Well, class, it seems school is out early today due to a national crisis. Please line up in an orderly fashion and move to the emergency bunker. It should hold up against the golem until the Royal Guard shows up.&quot;</p><p class="double">At that moment, a large rainbow wave of magic exploded from somewhere inside Ponyville. The golem, attempting to right itself, collapsed into an inanimate pile of crystal as the blast wave passed over.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee watched it for a few moments. After determining that it wasn&#039;t about to get back up, she turned to the staring students with a bright smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well! It seems the national crisis has passed. However, following standard procedure, you children should wait here for your relatives to pick you up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seeing the students continue to stare, she smiled again. &quot;Tell you what. Since you&#039;ve been such good students, I&#039;ll let you have the next... 3 days off.&quot;</p><p class="double">This broke the silence, as the students cheered. As far as they were concerned, Cheerilee was now officially the Best. Teacher. Ever. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.15</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“It is time for you... to fulfil... your destiny,” Celestia said grandly.</p><p class="double">Twilight, in what probably shouldn&#039;t have surprised anypony, pulled out a list. “Which one?”</p><p class="double">“...pardon?” Celestia frowned. “Which one?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;ve got quite a few of them by now. Let&#039;s see... be the most powerful unicorn in my generation, that&#039;s done. Gain the Element of Magic, done. Beat Discord? Done-a-roonie.”</p><p class="double">She began making tally marks in the floor, under the gaze of an increasingly bemused Celestia and all the other Elements. “I&#039;m fairly sure the thing with Chrysalis was something involving destiny as well. Rematch with Trixie? Yeah, sounds about right. Oh, the time travel thing – and all those Pinkie Sense incidents. If those had gone wrong, I might have broken time, so that all sounds destiny-y.”</p><p class="double">Twilight unrolled the scroll further. “Sombra, yeah, that sounds good... aha!”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked hopeful. “Yes?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn rolled up the scroll. “I&#039;ve got it! I&#039;m ready to become the best high jumping unicorn in history!”</p><p class="double">Even Pinkie looked confused at that.</p><p class="double">Seeing their expressions, Twilight shrugged. “Well, what else am I going to do with these wings?”</p><p class="double">She dropped the perception filter she&#039;d put on them back when she&#039;d <i>really</i> ascended, dealing with Sombra, and everypony jumped.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d those come from?” Dash demanded.</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Around.”</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
