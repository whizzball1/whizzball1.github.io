				<a name='1'></a><h3>Loops 1</h3>
<p>1</p><p>Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">She was stuck in some kind of time loop. By now, the evidence was incontrovertible – despite what everything she knew about magic, even time magic, said.</p><p class="double">Every time the loop reset, she was right back here in the Canterlot library, just before trying to warn Celestia about the return of Nightmare Moon. It had taken her three loops to determine, experimentally, that nothing from one loop was carried over into the next.</p><p class="double">Except her memories.</p><p class="double">“Well,” she said, brightly, “If there was a better opportunity for study, I’ve never encountered it before. Spike! A book, please! Which doesn’t matter.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">2</p><p>Nightmare Moon spread her wings, laughing as the inhabitants of Ponyville panicked. “The night will last forever!”</p><p class="double">After a moment, she noticed something on her left wing. A small red dot of light, that was moving towards her body proper even as she watched.</p><p><hr></p><p>A huge blast of rainbow hit Luna’s alternate form, as Rainbow Dash broke the sound barrier right before impact.</p><p class="double">Turned out that Dash didn’t actually channel harmony itself when she did that. But on seeing a thoroughly concussed Alicorn collapse to the floor, Twilight considered it at least progress. </p><p><hr></p><p>3</p><p>Another loop, another Summer Sun celebration.</p><p class="double">It was sort of cruel, beating up Luna like she was. But then, so far she’d been grateful for being freed from the darkness every time, no matter how strange the method Twilight used.</p><p class="double">This was shaping up to be an exceptional one, though.</p><p class="double">“Ooh! And that’s definitely an uppercut she’ll feel in the morning!” Pinkie shouted, from the balloon floating over what was left of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“But Black Sooty comes back with a bolt of pure night, and – no, it’s splashed off his scales!”</p><p class="double">AJ shook her head as she adjusted the camera. “Gotta say, Twilight, this ain’t what ah was expectin’ to be the reason y’all asked for extra apples.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Dragons like Spike undergo an exceptional growth phase when their hoard is in danger. I was able to get him into the frame of mind with the apples and a load of other stuff, then when Nightmare Moon turned up I told him Rarity would be in danger if her plan went through, and, well…”</p><p class="double">Pinkie spread her forelegs. “Spikezilla versus Nightmare Moon! Round 1! Fight!”</p><p class="double">Spike spat out a blast of flame that turned the arrested dawn into daylight.</p><p><hr></p><p>4</p><p>“um… excuse me, miss nightmare, but, uh… do you want some tea?”</p><p class="double">Twilight watched in disbelief as Luna’s corruption flowed off of her like water and dissipated. “To think it took me this long to try Fluttershy…”</p><p><hr></p><p>5</p><p>Sombra, now, was more amusing. While she came at Nightmare Moon with barely a day’s prep time each new Loop, she could have as much as a year and a half when the Crystal Empire situation came up.</p><p class="double">Her former number one method had just been getting Rainbow to hit him at half again the speed of sound after loudly praying for divine intervention. The look on Sombra’s face for the split second before he bounced off the wall had been priceless.</p><p class="double">But now…</p><p class="double">“Thanks for your help, Gilda.”</p><p class="double">“No problem, general.” The griffin saluted, then chuckled. “Wasn’t sure what the hell you were thinking, but you were right. We <i>did</i> all want a bit of fun.”</p><p class="double">Two thousand griffins swarmed into the Crystal Empire’s palace, and then out again with a dozen of the largest carrying Sombra between them.</p><p class="double">“What do you want us to do with him, general?”</p><p class="double">Twilight considered. “Slap two power limiters on him and leave him tied up on Rarity’s doorstep with a bow. And a label saying ‘new model’.”</p><p class="double">“Evil.” Gilda grinned. “I approve. What next?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn shrugged. “I’ve heard this place has some <i>good</i> wine in the cellars. Comes of centuries of isolation, or whatever happened to it. I think we could consider them… spoils of war?”</p><p class="double">“That’ll piss off your brother.”</p><p class="double">“Well, he <i>did</i> forget to let me know about his wedding last week.” <i>Again.</i></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">6</p><p>“The Winter Wrap-Up in Ponyville is traditionally done without magic, Miss Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“Oh. How do you do the clouds?”</p><p class="double">The Mayor blinked. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Pegasi use magic to fly and move clouds. And the reason earth ponies are so strong is because of their magic. So is it going to be groundbound pegsasi and unicorns without use of their horns doing all the work?”</p><p class="double">“…er…”</p><p class="double">“Because it might take a while.”</p><p class="double">“I’ll… see if I can talk to my subordinates…”</p><p class="double">Twilight felt like laughing beneath her pleasant expression. She hadn’t caught that the first time through, but it <i>was</i> a good point…</p><p class="double">What did she think this cutie mark meant anyway, shovels?</p><p><hr></p><p>7</p><p>Discord’s statue cracked, then shattered. Out of the stone ruins came the chaotic draconequus. “I’m back, baby! Okay, time to screw with Tia and Lulu and… whoever she’s got wielding the Elements this time. This should be fun.”</p><p class="double">A dot of purple light appeared on the ground next to him. Discord materialized a microscope, turned it upside down, and examined it minutely at a distance of eight feet.</p><p class="double">Then he threw the microscope away and looked at the dot of light. “Wonder what this is…”</p><p class="double">“Hate detected.”</p><p class="double">The voice seemed to come from everywhere at once.</p><p class="double">The purple dot was joined by a red one, and then a green one, to either side. Turning, he saw blue, pink and yellow. They thickened, becoming searchlight beams, which at least let him know where they were coming from – above.</p><p class="double">“Firing orbital friendship cannon.”</p><p class="double">Discord slapped his forehead, producing a fish. “Oh, bodkins.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“I feel kind of bad for him…” Fluttershy muttered.</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Now we’ve shown him we’re not to be trifled with, we’ll let him out again and see if we can make him behave. Okay, Rainbow, take the cloud down!”</p><p class="double">“You got it, Twi! Hah, I wish I’d seen the look on his face!”</p><p><hr></p><p>8</p><p>“Right, how did that spell go…”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the sky. It was only a few minutes from dawn, on the summer solstice.</p><p class="double">If everything went as it had first time, Nightmare Moon would arrive in just a few minutes to start going on about how the night would last forever. Honestly, it was getting a little boring.</p><p class="double">Twilight sometimes considered she’d gotten a little jaded. Well, what could the universe expect if it made her keep doing the same thing over and over?</p><p class="double">Anyway, this at least would be hilarious.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“…forever!”</p><p class="double">As Nightmare Moon started her evil laugh, Twilight closed her eyes and focused.</p><p class="double">A faint touch to the Element of Magic… a spell from an ancient spellbook...</p><p class="double">“Not today, villain!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon paused, looking around to the source of the loud voice, and saw a purple unicorn rearing back on her hind legs.</p><p class="double">“I will defeat you myself, in the name of Princess Celestia!”</p><p class="double">“You? You’re nothing but a <i>child</i>. Is this all Celestia has to stop me?”</p><p class="double">“Yep! Magic power, go!”</p><p class="double">At that point, Twilight’s spell triggered. Everything went white, and when it faded she had the Element of Magic on her forehead, and a familiar dress on her back.</p><p class="double">More importantly, though, she was once more <i>Princess</i> Twilight.</p><p class="double">“…what?” the Nightmare of the Moon managed. “But… what?”</p><p class="double">“That’s kinda cool.” Spike muttered. “When’d you learn<i> that?</i>”</p><p class="double">“It was in the Star Swirl wing.” The newly ascended alicorn replied, before launching herself into the air and conjuring dozens of balls of lightning.</p><p class="double">A good old fashioned punch up would be just the thing.</p><p><hr></p><p>9</p><p class="double">“Weirdest. Loop. Ever.” Twilight muttered, watching the plaid sky turning amber as the moon rose in the north.</p><p class="double">It was. For one thing, she wasn’t Celestia’s student this time – though that wasn’t all that unusual in and of itself. For another, she was viewed a lot like Pinkie Pie had been in the original loop.</p><p class="double">That would be because Pinkie Pie in <i>this</i> version of Equestria was the faithful student of King Discord, benevolent ruler of the surreal land of Equestria. And, furthermore, there was evidence that the dreaded Infernal Blaze was returning.</p><p class="double">“It’s like someone held the whole country up to a funhouse mirror…”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. At least there were some benefits. For one thing, things made sense around her – it was like she normalized the area nearby.</p><p class="double">“Right. I lay about even odds on either me being the Element of Laughter this loop, or the Element of Magic being one of the five necklaces…”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Fools! I shall destroy your pitiful ruler, and then restore my rightful Empire of the Sun!”</p><p class="double">Twilight raised a hoof. “Excuse me, miss Infernal Blaze, but… you’re kind of on fire.”</p><p class="double">“Of course I’m on fire! I am the goddess of the sun! I…” Infernal Blaze broke off, sniffed, and started screaming. “Oh me I AM on fire! Help!”</p><p class="double">“Lake’s over there.” Applejack volunteered.</p><p class="double">Infernal Blaze jumped bodily into the lake, which happened to be one of chocolate sauce. There was a <i>splutch</i>, a hiss, and a delicious smell.</p><p class="double">After a moment Celestia’s head came out of the sauce. “Towel please.”</p><p><hr></p><p>10</p><p class="double">“So, Twilight Sparkle. Your friends have abandoned you. What do you say to that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight conjured a notebook. “Well, I <i>am</i> looking for a thesis subject…I think ‘the long term effects of chaos magic’ sounds good.”</p><p class="double">Discord blinked. “Pardon? You’re… not going to stop me?”</p><p class="double">“Eeeenope.” The unicorn began writing. “So, discordification of a pony involves inverting one of their key personality traits along its own axis. Do you take a guess as to what that is, or is one of your salient divine powers the ability to analyze that sort of thing?”</p><p class="double">“What?” Discord frowned, and turned the notebook into a bluejay. “You’re far too analytical, Twilight Sparkle. This is the realm of chaos!”</p><p class="double">Twilight glared at him, flared her horn, and a bubble of normality bloomed out from her to the size of a small room. The bluejay flew into it, turned back into a book, and fluttered over to Twilight to let her keep writing. “I know, that’s why I’m writing all this down.”</p><p class="double">“You… that’s a failsafe spell, isn’t it? How is that working?”</p><p class="double">“I cast the spell backwards.” She noted that down along with everything else. “Wild magic traits in area under influence… do not… always scramble a pre-scrambled spell. Thanks for the info!”</p><p class="double">She looked up at him. “If you’re not going to let me interview you, then don’t let me keep you. I’m sure you have lots of plans for redecorating.”</p><p class="double">Discord looked at her, then off into the middle distance at nothing, shrugged, and shot off towards Manehattan.</p><p class="double">“Right, that’s got rid of him. Now, where did the Crusaders go…”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Day eighteen… or thirty-seven, depending on if you trust the sunrises. Discord has apparently spent three entire days converting every single cloud in the country into an elaborate topiary sculpture. On a related note, it now rains nectar.” Twilight hummed, watching a parasprite playing tennis with Angel Bunny. “That one almost makes sense, really. Plants and nectar.”</p><p class="double">“I’m hurt.” Discord slid out of the pages of her book. “I’d hate to become too predictable.”</p><p class="double">“You kind of are, actually. I mean, there’d be no point turning the roads from flagstones into granite, it wouldn’t be funny.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” He snapped his claws, and an explosion of heat washed over them.</p><p class="double">Twilight held up another notebook. It was turned to a page with the words ‘and then Discord turns it into high temperature, nearly molten granite’. “See what I mean?”</p><p class="double">“Give me that!” He snatched the whole set out of her magical grip. “This is eight hundred predictions for how I’ll react to certain straight lines!”</p><p class="double">“Exactly. And I’ve been ticking off the ones you’ve done.” This time, Twilight held up a bingo sheet. “If you do two more, I get a full house.”</p><p class="double">Discord ground his teeth into flour, then blew flame on the flour to make some bread, pulled it into a baguette and ate it. “That is very annoying.”</p><p class="double">“Yep. Oh, and that’s another one off the list…” Twilight said, calmly. “I expected more from you.”</p><p class="double">“I can be unpredictable if I feel like it!” Discord said. “Go on, test me.”</p><p class="double">With a flash of purple, Twilight vanished. She came back two seconds later with some Poison Joke in a careful telekinetic grip. “Is this one of yours, by the way?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, last time I was out. Same with timber wolves and zap apples, I was quite the gardener…” The draconequus summoned a hoe with a flash of light and prodded the ground, which collapsed away under him. “Hm. That isn’t encouraging.”</p><p class="double">“Nice to see you’re keeping up old habits.” The blue plant was crushed by telekinetic force into a dense mass. Twilight next brought out a painting from a famous surrealist. “This is not a pipe.”</p><p class="double">“Yes it is.” Discord plucked it out of the picture, leaving behind a traffic cone. “I do like that pony’s art, though.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Anyway, want to try smoking the Poison Joke? That should do with your nasty case of predictability.” Twilight showed the bingo card again. She’d crossed off the last square when Discord pulled the pipe out of the painting.</p><p class="double">“Oh, go on then.” Discord rammed it into the pipe, set it on fire, and took a deep pull. From the wrong end, of course.</p><p class="double">Twilight held up her notebook one more time at the last page, with a triumphant grin. ‘Discord gets stoned’.</p><p class="double">“Oh, you crafty little…” Before he’d quite finished the sentence, Discord was a statue again.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight frowned suddenly. “Now, where did the others go? I’m going to need them to help operate the Elements…”</p><p><hr></p><p>11</p><p>Trixie laughed as she cast two powerful age-altering spells on Snips and Snails, luxuriating in the power the Alicorn Amulet gave her. “See, Twilight Sparkle? Now Trixie is the greater unicorn!”</p><p class="double">“Maybe, yeah.” Twilight said, nodding. “Oh, is that an Alicorn Amulet? I read about those, they give you a huge power boost. Are we allowed those?”</p><p class="double">“Silence! Of course Trixie is allowed the Amulet, it took her many months of effort to obtain!”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight’s horn flickered slightly, and the Element of Magic appeared on her brow. “Hey, watch this!”</p><p class="double">There was a brilliant wash of purplish light.</p><p class="double">When it faded, Twilight checked her new wings over. “Hmmm, bit larger than last time. Maybe I’m getting better at doing this alone.”</p><p class="double">Trixie gibbered. “But… but… how? What?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I <i>am</i> the bearer of the Element of Magic.” Twilight shrugged her wings. “Turns out it comes with benefits.”</p><p class="double">“That is completely unfair on Trixie!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, hush. You’re the one who brought a magical superweapon to this duel first, don’t complain now it’s not the one sided battle you hoped it was.” Twilight conjured a spell circle fifty feet across, which shunted the two male unicorns away and sealed the two mares in a shimmering opalescent dome. “Now, I’d actually quite enjoy a duel for once. Are you going to chicken out, or give me a good workout?”</p><p class="double">Trixie replied with a fireball the size of a house. Twilight grinned, and started with four Marelin’s Magical Missiles and a Cone of Lightning.</p><p class="double">This would be <i>fun</i>.</p><p><hr></p><p>12</p><p>Applejack was a very confused pony. She’d gone to bed that night with everything normal, and the next morning… well, apart from anything else Big Mac asked her if everything was ready for the family reunion.</p><p class="double">She hadn’t known one was going on at all.</p><p class="double">To make things worse, there was no sign at all of her friends. More to the point, it was a completely different <i>season</i> than when she went to bed, and topping everything off was that Applebloom was quite visibly bored.</p><p class="double">She’d asked where her friends Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo were, and ‘bloom had looked at her like she’d gone funny in the head.<hr></p><p>In fact, it was all so confusing she wondered if she’d tried bucking all the trees in the orchard again.</p><p class="double">And then the whole Apple family had shown up, and she’d spent the morning scrambling to keep up with details she didn’t know. Something somepony had said suggested this was years in the <i>past</i>, which couldn’t be right… but which made sense, from what ‘bloom was acting like.</p><p class="double">Then there was a loud bang, and a cloud of smoke.</p><p class="double">“Watch in awe!” a voice shouted from inside the smoke.</p><p class="double">“Ah, ponyfeathers. What all is Trixie doing here?” Applejack muttered.</p><p class="double">Then the cloud cleared, to reveal…</p><p class="double">The farm pony’s jaw dropped. “What th’ hay? Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed! It is I, the Great and Infinitely Knowledgeable Twilight!”</p><p class="double">The baby dragon next to her – Spike, clearly, Applejack realized – sighed and shook his head. “She’s been like this all morning. I have no clue why.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“So, Twi. Spill. What in Tartarus is goin’ on?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “I have no idea. For some reason, I – and now you, apparently – keep going back to the dawn of the day we first met. I’ve been doing this for a hundred and thirty five loops, so I get kind of… stir crazy.” Behind them, Spike tried to eat too many apples at once, incidentally doing a nice job of keeping the rest of the Apple clan distracted from why Applejack was talking so familiarly with the strange unicorn.</p><p class="double">“So, what now? And ah could swear you were a Princess last time we met…”</p><p class="double">“Sometimes.” Twilight shook her head. “About fifteen loops ago, I went full alicorn right in front of Nightmare Moon tomorrow. It confused her so much, it was hilarious. Anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should, well… learn what we can, keep ponies safe, try to work out why these loops are happening, and have fun. By the way, don’t be surprised if things are… different.”</p><p class="double">“Different how?” Applejack looked sceptical.</p><p class="double">“Well, I once started a loop to discover that I was actually the student of Queen Nightmare Moon. Just… take a moment to check your memory each time, okay?”</p><p class="double">The orange mare nodded. “Got it. Now, what do we do about Nightmare Moon?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned evilly. “I spent two loops learning everything Trixie had to teach me. She actually knows quite a lot about illusions. Now…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“…last forever!”</p><p class="double">“Ah can see why you said you were bored, Twi.” Applejack muttered. “Does she say that every time?”</p><p class="double">“Every time.” Twilight confirmed, and lit her horn for a moment. “It’s done. Go.”</p><p class="double">She raised her hoof. “Excuse me!”</p><p class="double">“What?” Nightmare Moon said, turning her gaze onto Twilight. “Do you have a question for your new empress?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, actually. It’s just… how, exactly, will we grow crops?”</p><p class="double">“…pardon? You interrupt me with <i>farming</i>?” The dark goddess’ eyes blazed.</p><p class="double">“Well, mortals – like us – kind of need food to survive. I’m sure you lost track of that a bit on the moon, but plants need the sun to supply them with energy – which they convert out of sunlight via chlorophyll and a source of water, as well as carbon dioxide in the air. That becomes glucose which is then converted into other sugars, like fructose, or just left as it is, and so that energy is stored in a form ponies can eat – so, without the sun, no food.”</p><p class="double">Even Nightmare Moon’s eyes had glazed over during that explanation. After a moment, she shook her head to clear it and pointed her horn directly at Twilight. “Such concerns are nothing to me! I will not be denied my rightful overlordship by such ridiculous problems as <i>plants!</i>”</p><p class="double">At that point, an invisible Applejack bucked her in the chin so hard she went flying backwards through the rear wall.</p><p class="double">“Buck <i>that</i>.” the farmpony said, then turned to Twilight. “That work?”</p><p class="double">“Nicely, thanks AJ.” Twilight replied. “I’ll just go get the Elements of Harmony. Be back in a tick!”</p><p class="double">She vanished in a flash of purple.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Outside, Nightmare Moon picked herself up from the wreckage of one whole side of the building. “What impertinent insect has the temerity to-“</p><p class="double">She paused. She could hear a voice talking.</p><p class="double">“Right, when my one starts to glow, just think about what I told you all to.”</p><p class="double">It was that annoying unicorn who’d been arguing with her. What was she talking about <i>now?</i></p><p class="double">“So, mine’s Loyalty, right? Awesome!”</p><p class="double">“I think Laughter is perfect for me!”</p><p class="double">Those were new – and annoying – voices. Wait… she could swear that those words were… ominous.</p><p class="double">“Kindness, kindness… oh, I hope I get this right. Sorry, miss Nightmare Moon, ma’am, but it is for your own good…”</p><p class="double">“This is marvellous! It matches my cutie mark perfectly!”</p><p class="double">Oh. That’s right. Horsefeathers.</p><p class="double">Six colours of harmony hit her almost as hard as the earth pony had.</p><p><hr></p><p>13</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned at the three other Loopers. “Right, you three, you’ll like this.”</p><p class="double">“What are you planning this time?” Dash asked. “Bet it’ll be fun!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Oh, actually…” she conjured four pairs of mirrored sunglasses, and slipped them over their faces. “We’ll need these.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon finished her speech.</p><p class="double">Twilight promptly hit her with a Want-It-Need-It spell.</p><p class="double">“And that is what we call poetic justice.” The purple unicorn lectured, as several hundred ponies swarmed the stage to hug the startled Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled. “That <i>is</i> funny! Better than when you showed us Spikezilla!”</p><p class="double">“We love you!” somepony shouted, and then there was a <i>crash</i> as Big Mac managed to tackle Luna’s corrupted self.</p><p class="double">“Well, now ah wonder if he’s just easy to affect with spells like that…” Applejack said, frowning at her brother. “Or if he just has a crush on her like ah heard.”</p><p class="double">“I dunno.” Twilight shrugged. “Hey, want to try to work out what else the Elements can do? I bet you could tell if somepony’s telling the truth or not if you get a strong enough connection with the Element of Honesty.”</p><p class="double">Dash looked up, grinning. “What would Loyalty let me do?”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know. This calls for science!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">14 (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305602/1/HTTYD_Loops" rel="nofollow">How To Train Your Dragon loop</a> crossover 1)</p><p class="double">“You are kidding.”</p><p class="double">The small green Toothless looked over at his (unusually, four-legged) companion through time and space. “Afraid not. This place is mainly populated by ponies.”</p><p class="double">As Hiccup – well, his memories said he was called Hocus Hiccup, which was <i>even worse</i> than normal – contemplated this, a cyan… pegasus?... came through the door.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Twi, what’s the plan for – you’re not Twilight. Where is she?”</p><p class="double">Hiccup rolled his eyes. “Never seen her before. Is she the local Loop anchor? I think I’ve replaced her.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t know what ‘anchor’ you’re talking about, don’t care. Where is she, buster?”</p><p class="double">Hiccup and Toothless exchanged glances. “Welcome to your first fused loop, then. Sorry, you’re not getting your friend – Twilight, right? – this loop. I’m taking her place for all intents and purposes.”</p><p class="double">The cyan pegasus looked suspicious for another second, then closed her eyes and concentrated. Hiccup felt some strange, <i>deep</i> magic pulse for a moment.</p><p class="double">“Okay, yeah, she’s not anywhere I can feel for some reason. I’ll believe you… for now. Until AJ can give you a look over, anyway.”</p><p class="double">“Another looper? Sorry, another time looping person?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, she is. Oh, I’m Rainbow Dash – but you can call me awesome.”</p><p class="double">“Suddenly I’m reminded of Astrid.” Hiccup muttered to Toothless, who nodded in return.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">As Nightmare Moon proclaimed her eternal reign, Hiccup looked to the five native Loopers. “This happen every time?”</p><p class="double">“Like clockwork.” The orange pony – AJ – said wearily. “Last few times, Twi had us blast her with the elements mid-speech for the hell of it.”</p><p class="double">“Does it have to be that? Or can she be defeated another way?”</p><p class="double">“She can!” The pink pony said. “We usually use Spikezilla every twenty or so loops!”</p><p class="double">“Right. Toothless, you’re on.”</p><p class="double">The little dragon nodded, and ran forward. As the girls gasped, he swelled and shifted form into the twenty foot lithe predator from Berk, then took wing.</p><p class="double">“Fun fact.” Hiccup said, brightly. “Toothless’ breed of dragon is called the Night Fury. They’re nearly invisible in the dark, and they’ve evolved as ambush predators against other flying entities at night.”</p><p class="double">Blue flame shot through the air and erupted on something overhead. <i>Wing! Two points!</i></p><p class="double">The next shot was green. <i>Oh, cool. The postal magic can mix in with my fire… hey, Hiccup?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Yeah?</i></p><p class="double"><i>I just found out how to teleport other objects at range.</i></p><p class="double">Hiccup winced in sympathy for any enemy they would fight in the future. Ever. Except possibly Aizen, who frankly deserved it.</p><p class="double">A green fire burned overhead for a moment, and a startled looking Princess Luna slammed into the ground horn first.</p><p class="double">Toothless alighted next to her, looking incredibly smug, and shifted back to his loop-native form. “I just teleported her armour right off her. Who’s awesome?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie raised a hoof. “Ooh, I know this one! It’s Dash!”</p><p class="double">“You know it!”</p><p class="double">Toothless looked slightly deflated. “Whatever. Regardless, Rider, that power is a keeper.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy eeped. “Um… did you say, rider? As in, dragon rider?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I’m normally bipedal. Human, actually, if that means anything to… you?”</p><p class="double">All of them were staring at him.</p><p class="double">Rarity spoke first. “You mean Lyra was actually <i>right?</i>”</p><p class="double">With a sigh, Toothless reached into Hiccup’s mane, connected to his subspace pocket and pulled out some projection equipment. “We’re going to have to give them the ‘welcome to the multiverse’ talk. Why is it always us?”</p><p class="double">“Ranma’s having a year off?” Hiccup suggested, then sniggered at the thought of how <i>he’d</i> take this universe. Wild horse indeed… especially since the gender ratio seemed about five to one in favour of female, here.</p><p><hr></p><p>Meanwhile, in an entirely different universe, Harry Potter watched with interest as Quirrelmort was used as a ping-pong ball by the unicorn he’d tried to kill.</p><p class="double">“And <i>this</i> is for basing your strategy on inadequate research!”</p><p class="double"><i>Note to self, make sure this unicorn never meets Hermione.</i></p><p class="double">A phoenix flamed in for a moment, then vanished towards Hagrid’s hut and the young dragon within.</p><p class="double"><i>Huh. I thought he didn’t feel like Fawkes. And Norbert wasn’t female… wonder if that’s linked somehow.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, how do we beat Discord this time?” Dash asked. “New guy, you got any ideas?”</p><p class="double">Hiccup mulled over everything he’d been told about the chaos entity. “Okay, I know. I’ll Befriend him.”</p><p class="double">“We tried that. Pinkie’s the only one who can do it reliably. Fluttershy sometimes works too.”</p><p class="double">“You’re not familiar with Nanoha’s world. The word has a different meaning there. Toothless?”</p><p class="double">The rest of them looked over to the black dragon – and didn’t find him. Instead there was a small black octahedron.</p><p class="double"><i>Stand by. Ready.</i></p><p class="double">Hiccup picked Toothless’ Device form up in a hoof. “Right, let’s go.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Ah, hello.” Discord said, emerging from the stained glass window.</p><p class="double">Hiccup tilted his head, examining the magic. “Okay, this’ll work.” With a thought, he&nbsp;&nbsp;transferred Raising Dragon to his back, where it transformed into a kind of harness with a pair of gigantic cannons.</p><p class="double"><i>Set up.</i> <i>Blaster-three.</i></p><p class="double">With a grin, Hiccup planted his hoof. The floor cracked, and strings music came from nowhere. “I always wanted to do this.”</p><p class="double"><i>Firing Lock is cancelled.</i></p><p class="double">“Oh, I saw this…” Discord said, sounding nervous. “Can’t remember how it ended, though.”</p><p class="double"><i>Cartridge load. Divine Buster.</i></p><p class="double">“Right, right, that was it.” The draconequus fled the palace through the window.</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “I remember this video too!” Her voice changed slightly. “He’s going to blast right through the walls? Oh dear sweet mother of Celestia!”</p><p class="double">Said deity’s eyes widened, just before the gigantic eruption of magic demolished one of the load-bearing walls of her palace.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Owie.” Discord said, coughing out smoke.</p><p class="double">There didn’t seem to be much else to say.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>15 (HTTYD crossover 2)</p><p class="double">“…what the hay?” Twilight muttered, falling forwards onto her stomach. “Oof!”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” A voice that was at once familiar and not familiar asked. “Oh, huh. New looper this time.”</p><p class="double">“Looper?” she asked, trying to push herself back up again. It hurt. For one thing, she didn’t seem to have hooves any more. “Do you mean time loops?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. You don’t look used to human body shape, hold on.” The owner of the voice grabbed her arm and pulled her up. </p><p class="double">She turned, barely giving her own new body a glance, and saw that the speaker was a green-eyed human. He reminded her (very slightly) of the human boy she’d seen last time, which had been only a few months long before something blew the castle up.</p><p class="double">“There you go. Strange. According to this loop’s memories, you’re my twin sister. Well, welcome to Berk.”</p><p class="double">“Loop memories?” After a moment, Twilight realized what he meant by the term. This version of her – Twit? Seriously? Worst name ever – had her own complete set of memories from birth. She remembered growing up on an island full of Vikings, being mocked along with her brother – Hiccup – for not being Viking enough, and their village being constantly attacked by dragons.</p><p class="double">“Wow, that’s unusual…” she muttered. “I feel like I know you now.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that’s how it works. I take it you’re relatively new to the Loops?”</p><p class="double">“I’ve done several hundred!”</p><p class="double">Hiccup shrugged. “I’m at over ten thousand, and some of the first generation Loopers have done several million. What’s your original name?” Seeing her surprise, he shrugged. “Berk is the only place that could possibly come up with a name as silly as <i>Twit.</i> I don’t doubt you’d rather use your real one.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight.” She answered, after a moment. “Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, neat. I took your place last Loop. The others are fine, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“You did? Huh.” Twilight frowned. “So, I’m not used to other loops… what happens here?”</p><p class="double">“Dragon riding, basically.” Hiccup reached into his leather jerkin and pulled out… projection equipment?</p><p class="double">“I’ll give you the ‘welcome to the multiverse’ talk, if you haven’t had it already.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Hi, Spike.”</p><p class="double">The purplish dragon gave a rumbling growl. It sounded peeved.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, they can’t speak.” Hiccup explained for her. “Toothless is telepathic now, but that’s the result of a Pern Loop. Fun place, if you ever end up there.”</p><p class="double">He frowned. “Actually, if it’s Spike there too, I wonder how the Loop would resolve that. Dragons and riders on Pern tend to be same-gender. Anyway, I’ve got a couple of harness designs that might work for him…”</p><p class="double">Spike roared.</p><p><hr></p><p>16</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked awake, and did the near-instinctive check all Anchors and Loopers learned to do.</p><p class="double">Memory… normal time line. Nothing too unusual.</p><p class="double">Next, she felt the local magic to see if anyone else was Awake this Loop. None of the other Elements were active, meaning that Rarity and the rest were all their Prime Loop selves, and there was no sign of outside Loopers either.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Looks like I’m alone for once.” Twilight frowned. “What should I do…”</p><p><hr></p><p>“I won’t tolerate this anymore!”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked up from where Mrs. Cake had just overfilled her teacup. “What is it, my faithful student?”</p><p class="double">“You mock your subjects like that, tricking them into embarrassing themselves. It’s a terrible abuse of power!” Horn flaring, Twilight teleported away.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear. I’m sorry, Mrs. Cake, it seems my student is a little… off, today.” Celestia apologized.</p><p class="double">“That’s quite alright, your majesty.” Both Cakes chorused. Mr. Cake continued, “We’re quite familiar with Pinkie, and it seems as though Twilight is just as highly strung sometimes.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Three hours later, Celestia was trying to work out what on Equestria had happened.</p><p class="double">There were thousands of ponies of all three breeds marching on Canterlot, with red flags waving, singing a rather grim song about how the flags were red because they were dyed with… <i>blood,</i> of all things.</p><p class="double">And her student was apparently behind all this, giving speeches about “the proletariat” and “the bourgeoisie” and so on.</p><p class="double">It seemed as though Twilight had invented what she was calling ‘communism’.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Right.” Twilight said as she trotted across the moon, reading by the light reflected off the planet below. “That’s communism ticked off the list. One more revolution and I’ll be able to write the best researched politics essay in history!”</p><p class="double"><i>“That’s</i> why you did all this?” Luna asked, sitting next to her. “I thought you were serious! It’s why I joined in!”</p><p class="double">“I was, sort of. It’s just, well, I’m actually in a time loop. I’ve already tried out at least fascism, anarchism – that one was fun, I basically gave Pinkie a megaphone and waited – a democracy, a direct democracy, rule by the short and mercantile republicanism. Communism seemed like a good idea.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, brilliant idea.” Luna said, stamping on the moon’s surface. “If I hadn’t fired off that lunar survival spell, you would have exploded.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, shutup. I didn’t know that Celestia would get desperate enough to shove MY Element of Magic onto Trixie’s forehead and hope for the best.” Twilight stretched. “And you’re taking the idea of a time loop very calmly.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle, I happen to think you’ve snapped. I’m just humouring you.” Luna answered glibly.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned. “You seem awfully sassy for once.”</p><p class="double">“We’re in private. It’s allowed.”</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>2-1</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Twilight teleported into Ponyville. “Right, let’s see…”</p><p class="double">Pinkie bounced over. “Hiya again Twilight! I’ll go get the others!”</p><p class="double">“Thanks Pinkie!” she shouted, after the receding earth pony. “You alright, Spike?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” Spike muttered. “But who was she?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “I met her before, we stayed in touch.” <i>Technically true…</i> “Come on, let’s go over to that library we were assigned.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">“What’s the plan for this loop?” Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">“Nothing much.” Twilight shrugged. “No big plan, anyway. As for the Summer Sun celebration, I think it might be Pinkie’s turn.”</p><p class="double">“Yay!” Pinkie started drawing a plan. “I think that if Rarity helps set it up it won’t make anyone suspicious… and I can order a big shipment from Canterlot… you’ve got some spare money, right Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight nodded. “Dash, you’re the fastest. Mind helping Pinkie with getting that delivered?”</p><p class="double">Dash grinned. “Not at all!”</p><p class="double">“Right. Oh, what <i>is</i> your plan?”</p><p class="double">“Well, you know how Nightmare Night is all about appeasing Nightmare Moon with sweets?” Pinkie’s smile got wider. “I thought about thirty tonnes rigged up to pour on her when I pull the rope should work!”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">“…last forever!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie pulled the rope. The avalanche of sweet things crashed down on Nightmare Moon - and stopped, before flying sideways to cover Pinkie in confectionary.</p><p class="double">The other five Loopers started. “Pinkie!”</p><p class="double">“Did you think you could stop a goddess so easily?” Nightmare Moon laughed, then dissolved into sparkles of starry night which shot out the door. There was a crash.</p><p class="double">“Help!” Roseluck shouted from outside. “That horrible nightmare thing stole the library!”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Did Nightmare Moon just steal my house?”</p><p class="double">“Looks like.” Applejack said. “Come on, let’s dig Pinkie out before she tries t’ <i>eat</i> her way out.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Pinkie had swirls around her eyes when they got her out. “Owie… that must have been some hard candy…”</p><p class="double">“What do we do?” Fluttershy asked, as Pinkie shook it off and started popping caramel chocolates into her mouth. “That’s not normal, is it?”</p><p class="double">“No, it’s not. We’d better hurry and find her before things get worse.” Twilight frowned. “How can the rest of you do with manifesting your elements?”</p><p class="double">“Ah’m afraid ah need to have touched it first.” Applejack said. “Remember? We normally go collect them from the castle if we plan on blasting Nightmare Moon.”</p><p class="double">“Right. I’ll go get them now, just in case.” Twilight vanished.</p><p class="double">After about a minute, Rarity raised a hoof. “Shouldn’t she be back by now?”</p><p class="double">Dash focused on the secondary powers of her element. “She’s not harmed, I can tell that much. But she’s just not come back.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">“What the hay?” Rarity said, shocked, pausing as she exited through the large building’s door. “What has happened to my boutique?”</p><p class="double">The others looked it over. There didn’t appear to be any change – certainly nothing that would promote such a strong response from the elegant mare.</p><p class="double">“Look at it! Just look! Fluttershy, you must see!”</p><p class="double">“Er…” Fluttershy trotted closer, squinting. “That dress in the window has… oh, my. That’s terrible.”</p><p class="double">“What’s terrible?” Dash asked. “It can’t be that bad, can it?”</p><p class="double">“It’s been re-stitched half an inch off the join line!” Rarity said, her eyes wide. “And the one on the left side has been dyed four shades too dark!” She burst into motion, galloping into the building.</p><p class="double">A high scream came from inside. “Nooo! They’ve <i>all</i> been <i>ruined!</i> What cruel pony would pair <i>teal</i> with <i>chartreuse?</i>”</p><p class="double">The others exchanged looks.</p><p class="double">“Ah’m startin’ to suspect somethin’s up this loop…” Applejack muttered.</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Fluttershy sadly read the sign placed in front of her house. Dash peered over her shoulder. “What? ‘I have your animals, if you want them back pay the ransom of twelve hundred bits’? What kind of low-down, no good coward would do this?”</p><p class="double">“Ah thought it was Nightmare Moon.” Applejack pointed out. “What with her bein’ two steps ahead of us this loop an’ all.”</p><p class="double">Rarity was still mourning her dresses.</p><p class="double">Applejack took an uneasy look at Pinkie, who seemed to be on a sugar rush. Well, it could just be Pinkie being Pinkie, but her eyes looked just a little dilated…</p><p class="double">No, that had to be the sugar. Even Pinkie didn’t normally emit a faint musical hum.</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Big Mac caught up with them as they entered the Everfree proper. “Sis! Ah’ve been lookin’ all over for you. The trees…”</p><p class="double">“What?” Applejack asked. “Nothin’ bad happened, ah hope?”</p><p class="double">“That’s just it.” Big Mac shrugged. “They’re… lemons.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, what?” Dash said. “But you’re the <i>Apple</i> clan. Apples. Right? How could you miss planting lemons?”</p><p class="double">“They weren’t lemons yesterday.” Both siblings chorused.</p><p class="double">“How does that even make sense?” Dash was starting to feel like the voice of reason. It didn’t feel comfortable.</p><p class="double">“That’s just it, RD.” Applejack said. “It don’t.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Halfway to the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters, there was an explosion overhead. All five ponies’ heads snapped back, but all they saw was a series of expanding black rings.</p><p class="double">“I don’t like this…” Fluttershy said, looking around nervously.</p><p class="double">“Ooh!” Pinkie said. “A letter came down! Hey, Dash, it’s for you!”</p><p class="double">The indicated pegasus took it. It was thick paper, with an official-looking seal on the front.</p><p class="double">Holding it gingerly away from her, she opened it. When it failed to explode, she looked more properly.</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Rainbow Dash</i></p><p class="double"><i>We would like to inform you that you are our first choice for the position of Shadowbolt Captain, from over a hundred applicants.</i></p><p class="double"><i>The position carries a very competitive salary, and all our members have expressed interest in working with you.</i></p><p class="double">Dash laughed, pausing in her reading of the letter. “Hah! Like that’ll get me. We did this before!”</p><p class="double">“Well?” Pinkie said. “What does the rest of it say?”</p><p class="double">“Huh? There’s more?” Pinkie pointed. “Oh. Er…”</p><p class="double"><i>If you are unable to give this offer your time, we will of course have no hard feelings. In this case, the number two option for this position will be used, and hence the role will go to-</i></p><p class="double">“Lightning Dust?” Dash shouted. “That no-good two-bit careless… grah! Well, she’s not going to beat <i>me</i> this time!” She bunched up her legs to launch into the air, and got tackled by four ponies at once.</p><p class="double">“Stay good, Dashie!” Pinkie shouted.</p><p class="double">“It’s just another of Nightmare Moon’s tricks.” Rarity pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Um… I think it would be a bad idea.”</p><p class="double">“All right, all right. Sorry, okay?” One by one, her friends got off her. “Sorry. It just caught me by surprise, alright?”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Twilight slowly returned to consciousness. She’d materialized in the room with the Elements, like normal, and then…</p><p class="double">Oh. She’d been hit on the head by a book. Judging by the impact, it was probably Edgar the Griffin’s <i>Decline and Fall of the Romane Empire</i>. The omnibus edition.</p><p class="double">She looked around. Still the castle of the royal pony sisters. In fact, this was quite near the main entrance.</p><p class="double">And there were voices coming from said entrance. The others were nearly here? How long had she been out?</p><p class="double">Even as she tried to work out what else was wrong, they burst through the door.</p><p class="double">“Nightmare Moon!” Dash shouted. “You better give Twilight back!”</p><p class="double">Twilight tried to turn, to see where Nightmare Moon was-</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Pinkie shouted. “Don’t pretend we’re not here!”</p><p class="double">Then Twilight realized what had been so off when she woke up.</p><p class="double">She’d been meticulously painted black and dark purple, her mane styled, her cutie mark painted over… she’d been dressed in armour which looked awfully familiar… there were fake black wings strapped to her, and she was wearing contacts.</p><p class="double">“Girls, wait!” she said, urgently. “I’m not Nightmare Moon!”</p><p class="double">“That voice trick isn’t going to fool us!” Dash said.</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. “RD? On three.”</p><p class="double">Then somepony started laughing themselves sick. With a crash, a figure fell through a hole in the ceiling and slammed into the floor, still shaking with mirth.</p><p class="double">Twilight regained enough presence of mind to use some of the spells Rarity had taught her and recolor her coat to normal, then teleported out of the armour and summoned her Element of Magic.</p><p class="double">Everyone recognized the pony heaving with laughter over in the corner at once.</p><p class="double">“<i>Luna?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Ahh haa haa, hee hee, oh, my sides…” Luna finally contained her mirth enough to speak, and rolled onto her front before standing up. “Yes, it’s me... I assume there’s some kind of time travel going on?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Time loops. We’ve all done a good few hundred by now.”</p><p class="double">“Well… ah, I needed that.” Another giggle escaped. “I pranked you all, for once! Ah, that was better than anything Celly’s ever done!” Luna shook her head, and tried to stay on topic. “Right. So – pfft… so, you all seem to have been doing this for a while.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded enthusiastically. Twilight elaborated. “I’ve got no clue exactly how it happens, but it seems like I loop the most often and the rest of us are on-and-off. Somepony like you might be only around very rarely.”</p><p class="double">“We kin only hope.” Applejack said sarcastically. “Do y’all have any idea what I’m going to do with eight hundred lemon trees? Cuz I don’t.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p>2.2</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in the library as usual. She felt for her magic, and found… not quite nothing, but a very different sensation to normal.</p><p class="double">“What’s…”</p><p class="double">Her voice trailed off as she realized something else was missing. More specifically, Spike was – normally, she Awoke with him in the same room of the library.</p><p class="double">Then the doors slammed open in a flash of pink magic. “Hiya Twilight! You’ll never guess what Celly told us to do!”</p><p class="double">At that point, the Loop memories returned. Ah, that’s right. She was Twilight Sparkle, an earth pony whose theoretical knowledge of magic was good enough to get her a scholarship into the Academy anyway. And her best friend was Pinkie Pie, the craziest unicorn in Canterlot.</p><p class="double"><i>I’m going to need a freaking drink before this Loop is over…</i></p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Twilight felt an eye twitch coming on.</p><p class="double">This wasn’t as crazy as the “King Discord” loop, but it was starting to get close. Fluttershy was an earth pony (which made a fair amount of sense), Rainbow Dash was a unicorn with an obsession with speed and weather spells, and Applejack and Rarity were pegasi.</p><p class="double">Everyone’s special talent was still the same, though. It had made for a thoroughly strange loop so far, especially when Dash managed to break the sound barrier in a sprint…</p><p class="double">The reason for the eye twitch was just because Pinkie had access to teleport magic. It would go away once she managed to repress the memory again.</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">It <i>was</i> nice being an earth pony in one way, actually. She could finally properly study how much stronger and tougher she was now than when she was a unicorn. Of course, she’d tried examining the same thing when she was <i>Princess</i> Twilight, but alicorns had much stronger versions of all three kinds of pony magic.</p><p class="double">Mind you, the idea that earth ponies were stronger and faster than unicorns had had to compete with Rainbow Dash this Loop, and given up.</p><p class="double"><i>Hmm, let’s see… what happened next first time around…</i></p><p class="double">“Hey, Twilight, can you come over to the library pleeease?” Pinkie asked, materializing in a flash.</p><p class="double">“Sure, Pinkie!” For a fraction of a second, Twilight tried to teleport, then felt like facehoofing. <i>You’re an Earth Pony this loop, Twilight!</i> “What for?” she asked, to cover her mistake.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I found a spell under ‘A’ in some old book, and it says it needs the Elements of Harmony to help with it! It’ll be super-duper-nice!”</p><p class="double"><i>Ah, horsefeathers. This won’t end well.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Discord applauded. “I never thought of making the moon into a disco ball! I have to say, Celly, I do approve of your choice of new princess.”</p><p class="double">“Shut up.” Celestia said, sitting down next to him. “I forgot how hyperactive she gets, okay?”</p><p class="double">Overhead, Princess Pinkie Pie shot past trailing a rainbow and making cat noises.</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">2.3</p><p class="double">With a flash, Twilight materialized in Canterlot Castle right next to her brother. “Hi, B.B.B.F.F! What’s this I hear about a wedding?”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor flinched back. “Gah! Who the hell… Twily?”</p><p class="double">“That’s right!” Twilight replied, grinning. “What’s wrong?”</p><p class="double">“Your… your mane and coat…” Shining pointed. “You’ve dyed them bright pink.”</p><p class="double">“Yep! My friends and I formed a band, and Pinkie’s in charge, and she asked us to all dye our manes and coats! Sorry, I forgot to tell you about it. My bad, huh?”</p><p class="double">The other five Elements came in, having been dropped off outside by Twilight. Every last one of them was blazing fluorescent pink everywhere except for their tails.</p><p class="double">“But… but… what are our parents going to think?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “I’m sure it’ll be great fun! Hey, Pinks, what are we going to start with?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie pulled sheet music out of her mane. “Weee-ll, we have a choice between <i>The Song That Never Ends</i> or <i>Discordian Rapshody.</i>”</p><p class="double">Applejack frowned. &quot;Why not <i>Nightmare Moon&#039;s Revenge</i>, Pinkie? Twilight wrote that one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, sounds great!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor collapsed with a <i>thud</i>, finally overcome with shock.</p><p class="double">Twilight hoofbumped the others. &quot;Nice work, girls! That&#039;ll teach him to not let me know he&#039;s getting married.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">2.4</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p>Twilight stumbled, almost falling, and shivered. “That was <i>not</i> fun!”</p><p class="double">Spike watched, dumbfounded, as she teleported out of Canterlot library.</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Six bright flashes of light later, the other five Elements found themselves inside the library’s upper bedroom.</p><p class="double">“Girls…” Twilight tripped over her words. “Just… <i>hold </i>me.”</p><p class="double">Mutely, she spread her forelegs, and the others hugged her.</p><p class="double">“What’s wrong, Twi?” Dash asked. “Bad Loop?”</p><p class="double">“Basically.” Twilight sighed, and shook herself. “Okay. So, I ended up there after, you know… trying to see if the Element of Laughter worked for Discord.”</p><p class="double">Everyone contemplated that silently.</p><p class="double">“Where’d you end up, Transformers again?”</p><p class="double">“Applejack!” Fluttershy rebuked, then flinched. “Oops. Sorry for raising my voice.”</p><p class="double">“It’s fine,” everyone else chorused.</p><p class="double">“No, it wasn’t Transformers. Okay, I think I’m fine now, girls.”</p><p class="double">One by one, Applejack, Rarity, Dash and Fluttershy got off Twilight. Pinkie stayed hugging her.</p><p class="double">“Er, Pinkie… you as well, please.”</p><p class="double">“Nope!” Pinkie said. “You’ll need it again in a minute!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Whatever makes you happy. Anyway, I ended up in this kind of… bizarre version of Ponyville. Almost nobody actually <i>did</i> anything.”</p><p class="double">“Liiiike?”</p><p class="double">“Well, you know how Cheerilee works as a school teacher?” The others nodded. “Yeah. There, she was a storyteller.”</p><p class="double">Applejack frowned. “So what was her job, then?”</p><p class="double">“She didn’t have one. Nor did Pinkie – she just ran around giving everyone parties.”</p><p class="double">“Ooh!” Pinkie said. “I like the sound of that place!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, sending Pinkie’s mane flying. “No, you wouldn’t. You didn’t have any of your Laughter powers – you just occasionally used balloons to fly around.”</p><p class="double">“Whaaaat? This place made <i>me</i> boring?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Twilight pointed at Rarity. “I only saw you and Dash there, apart from Pinkie. You were some kind of stuck up princess.”</p><p class="double">“I was a <i>Princess?</i>” Rarity wobbled slightly, and materialized her couch just in case. “Twilight, I don’t see how you could possibly dislike the place!”</p><p class="double">“No, small-p. You were an heir, about the age of the Crusaders or less, and there wasn’t a queen that I saw.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” That sounded much less inviting to the white unicorn. “That’s no good.”</p><p class="double">“It just… nothing <i>happened</i>.”</p><p class="double">“What about me?” Dash said. “Please tell me I was awesome, at least!”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave her a look. “Dash, when I tell you this, I want you to remember the time that you replaced every book in my library with ones that were slightly out of print, and made me think I needed glasses.”</p><p class="double">“…yeah?”</p><p class="double">Twilight’s voice took on a syrupy sweet quality. <i>“Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.”</i></p><p class="double">Dash twitched, and fell over in a faint onto Rarity’s convenient couch.</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">2.5</p><p class="double">“Hey, uh… Miss Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up. It had been a fairly pleasant early Loop this time. None of the others were Awake, and she’d handled Nightmare Moon the normal way for once.</p><p class="double">Surprisingly, though, in front of her were Applebloom, Sweetie Belle and Scotaloo.</p><p class="double"><i>That can’t be right… it isn’t until Twist’s cute-caneara that they normally meet properly…</i></p><p class="double">“What is it, you three? Uh… I recognize you, you’re Applejack’s sister.”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Applebloom said proudly. “This is Sweetie Belle, Rarity’s sister, and this is Scootaloo. And we’re…”</p><p class="double">Twilight braced herself for the shout.</p><p class="double">“…well, we don’t know what’s happened. We’re in the past, somehow. Or, we’re in the present now, but we were in the future! But it wasn’t the future back then, and…”</p><p class="double">Raising a hoof, Twilight headed off Applebloom’s babbling explanation. “Okay, I understand. Now, I don’t know exactly <i>why</i> this has happened to you, but I know <i>what</i> has happened.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Scootaloo said. “You’re so smart, pr-uh, I mean, Miss Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned, summoned the Element of Magic, and momentarily flashed into alicornhood before undoing the spell again. “I’ve come back in time too. And this isn’t the first time. Basically, I keep looping back to the first day I came to Ponyville, and so do the other Elements of Harmony – sometimes. I don’t know how often you three will or if you’ll do it alone.”</p><p class="double">The Crusaders absorbed that information.</p><p class="double">“Miss Twilight?” Sweetie Belle said.</p><p class="double">“Just call me Twilight, please.”</p><p class="double">“Alright. Uh… Twilight, you said you’d come back more than once?”</p><p class="double">“I have.” Twilight confirmed.</p><p class="double">“Then… can you tell us what our cutie marks are?”</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “It doesn’t work like that. Even if you think you know what your cutie mark is going to be, you can end up with something completely different.”</p><p class="double">“Awww…” the crusaders chorused.</p><p class="double">“Besides, you’ve each had at least three different ones that I’ve seen.”</p><p class="double">Now they were just dumbfounded.</p><p class="double">“Uhhh… how does that work?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight conjured a blackboard. “Do you want the long version, or the short one?”</p><p class="double">“Short!” Scootaloo and Applebloom said hastily. Sweetie nodded.</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">“That wasn’t short…” Sweetie moaned. “That took half an hour!”</p><p class="double">“Of course it was!” Twilight said indignantly. “This <i>is</i> one of my thesis projects!”</p><p class="double">“Right… hey, I got a great idea!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo whispered to the other two, who exchanged nods with her. “Cutie Mark Crusader timeline fixers go!”</p><p class="double">Twilight watched them leave at a run. “This won’t end well. I don’t know where it’s going, but it <i>won’t</i> end well.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">From a distance, Twilight watched as the changeling army overran Canterlot.</p><p class="double">“I was right, it didn’t.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, Twilight.” Applebloom said morosely.</p><p class="double">“How did you even <i>do</i> this?”</p><p class="double">“Well, we wanted to get revenge on that mean Changeling Queen!” Scootaloo began. “But when we did our ‘this is why we’re beating you up’ speech, she just… took notes.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I think you girls still have a lot to learn about how everything has a result when you mess with time travel.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we worked that out.” Scootaloo kicked a pebble. “What now?”</p><p class="double">At that point, the changeling army captured Rarity, and Spike went off.</p><p class="double">“<i>This</i> is planning ahead, girls.” Twilight said smugly, as Spikezilla punched Chrysalis right out of the city. “Take notes.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">2.6</p><p class="double">“Hey, Pinkie?” Twilight mused, glancing over at the recently Awakened pink party pony.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, Twilight?” said pony replied, bouncing in place.</p><p class="double">“You know Nightmare Moon?” Twilight nodded at Luna’s dark side, currently mid speech.</p><p class="double">“Of course!”</p><p class="double">“Well, it just struck me that she’s not had a proper birthday party celebration since she got stuck on the moon… a thousand years ago.”</p><p class="double">Twilight handed Pinkie a key. “Here. I put supplies in the basement of the library. Go nuts.”</p><p class="double">A pink blur shot past her out the door, then back in again and landed on Nightmare Moon in a shower of pastries.</p><p class="double">“It’s your first belated birthday party!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare kicked out with her legs, missing Pinkie entirely. “Get OFF me, you worthless nag!”</p><p class="double">“Someone’s cranky! Must be party withdrawal!” Pinkie chuckled. “Hey, Twilight, go grab my party howitzer!”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “On it.”</p><p class="double">“Applejack, I need more apple flavoured pies, stat! And balloons, I must have balloons! And someone bring me <i>sprinkles!</i>”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy exchanged looks.</p><p class="double">“Well, they’re excited.” Dash eventually said, as Pinkie hog-tied Nightmare Moon with a length of tinsel and plonked her down in front of a cake that looked more like a bonfire.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Fluttershy replied. </p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Ten minutes later, Rarity polished off the last of the cake after being assured that one slice wouldn’t ruin her figure.</p><p class="double">“While that was an… irritating diversion,” Nightmare Moon simmered, “Now you have released me, I will continue. The Night Will-”</p><p class="double">“Fire, Twilight!”</p><p class="double">The party howitzer round detonated, covering everything with frosting half an inch thick and landing Nightmare Moon up against the wall again.</p><p class="double">“Now it’s time for your <i>second</i> belated birthday party!”</p><p class="double">There was another cake. There were more presents. There was a fresh supply of balloons.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon shook her head. “This is not how I envisaged my triumphant return.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">“Nine hundred and ninety nine…” Pinkie said chirpily. “Time for the last one!”</p><p class="double">She looked around. Sadly, not many ponies were really in the spirit of a birthday party any more, being mostly passed out in a satiated haze.</p><p class="double">And the country was kinda-sorta-running out of sugar.</p><p class="double">“Why?” Nightmare Moon croaked. “Why do you torment me like this?”</p><p class="double">“Torment? Silly, you don’t understand parties at all! They’re for fun! And they show that other ponies want to have fun <i>with</i> you!”</p><p class="double">“Besides.” Twilight said, delicately eating a scone. “If she hadn’t gotten it all out of her system now, you’d be being ambushed at random times for the next decade. Anyway, I thought you wanted to be appreciated.”</p><p class="double">“I have a new respect for the problems my sister faced.” Nightmare Moon deadpanned. “Now, can I please go? I need to… go and work off some of this sugar.”</p><p class="double">“One more candy apple and a smile…” Pinkie coaxed. “And off you go.”</p><p class="double">“…fine.” Nightmare Moon took the candy apple, and forced a grin. Pinkie clapped.</p><p class="double">“There you go! Don’t you feel better?”</p><p class="double">“A bit.” Nightmare Moon allowed.</p><p class="double">“Yay! Mission successful!”</p><p class="double">“And it only took y’all most of mah apples.” Applejack said. “Along with makin’ the Cakes the richest family in Equestria.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">2.7</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon strode back and forth upon the surface of her celestial home. <i>Not long now…</i></p><p class="double">“Hi!”</p><p class="double">She turned, eyes flashing, and saw an eager looking young unicorn… standing on the moon.</p><p class="double">“How are you alive?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that. Well, I guessed that lunar survival probably involved pressurized air in a bubble around the pony, so I adapted a bubble-head charm. Anyway,” the unicorn held out a sheaf of papers. “You hiring?”</p><p class="double">Confused, Nightmare Moon took the paper and began reading. “Twilight Sparkle… Adept class mage – really? You look very young for it.”</p><p class="double">“I can do the test, just like any other Adept.” Twilight said. “Anyway..?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon kept reading. “So, you’re my sister’s personal student?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but I’m trying to keep my options open. I think a bit of time rounding out my knowledge of black magic would help.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed…” Nightmare Moon looked sideways at Twilight. &quot;I think I could use somepony like you.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">The Ruler of the Night, Empress of Equestria, scowled out of her window.</p><p class="double">“It’s just not the same.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Well, it’s letting ponies grow plants, and it still IS night.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but my moon is supposed to be a pale orb of light, shimmering in the night sky. Not a giant mirror.”</p><p class="double">“Can’t blame me for getting rid of the inefficiencies in the system.”</p><p class="double">Two Night Guards alighted on the balcony. “Your darkness, there is a meeting of parliament in ten minutes.”</p><p class="double">“<i>And </i>you introduced this as well.” Nightmare groused. “I don’t see why we have to listen to all those idiotic minor nobles and sleazy politicians.”</p><p class="double">“That’s easy.” Twilight answered. “This way, everyone’s too busy trying to work out how to exploit the system to be able to find the Elements of Harmony.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p>Celestia kicked at the surface of the sun, which flared up in a burst of plasma.</p><p class="double">“Nopony knows the trouble I’ve seen, nopony knows my sorrows…”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">2.8 </p><p><hr> </p><p class="double">“These are my three sons. Spyro, age nineteen; Toothless, age seventeen; and Spike, age sixteen. Pick which one you want to be your fiancé.”</p><p class="double">Rarity groaned. “This is not going to be a fun loop…”</p><p class="double">“You’re telling me?” Twilight said, from the door. “I keep turning into a panda!”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">2.9 </p><p class="double"><hr>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="double">The last thing Twilight remembered was a flash of multicoloured light, then-</p><p class="double">“What were we doing?” she mumbled, as she forced her eyes open. “Something about giving the Crusaders the Elements of Harmony?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Applejack said from next to her. “And ah think we bucked the universe up.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around the furnished train compartment. “Oh. Hogwarts again. But why are we still ponies this time?”</p><p class="double">“Beats me.” Applejack shrugged. “Let’s go see if the others ended up in a different compartment of the train.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">“So, this isn’t a fused loop.” Twilight mused, as she watched everyone cheer Dash going into Gryffindor. “Looks like we’re replacing people. Dash for Harry seems vaguely appropriate – you know, lightning bolts – but nobody seems to be really noticing that we’re ponies.”</p><p class="double">“Is that unusual?” Fluttershy asked.</p><p class="double">“Fairly. They were <i>really</i> confused when I Looped into the Trek universe.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There, there…” Fluttershy said, scratching the enormous reptile under the chin. “You didn’t mean to hurt anyone, did you? It was that nasty Mister Riddle who made you do it, wasn’t it?”</p><p class="double">The Basilisk crooned, thumping the floor with its enormous tail.</p><p class="double">Pinkie snatched up the diary. “Dibs! Ooh, this’ll be nice. My very own book friend I can write in and it can talk to me and I can tell it about parties and…”</p><p class="double">The Diary Horcrux twitched, then self destructed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“The first challenge is to, ah… <i>retrieve the golden egg</i>.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Dash exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Right, so you first, Miss Rainbow Dash, of, ah…”</p><p class="double">“The Wonderbolt Academy!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry. I should have remembered.”</p><p class="double">As Dash drew out a Ukranian Ironbelly, Twilight rolled her eyes. The Twiwizard Tournament had got seriously broken this Loop – it had entered her as a student in Celestia’s Academy and Dash as part of the <i>Wonderbolt</i> Academy.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight teleported to the egg, picked it up telekinetically, and teleported back. “Right, that was easy.”</p><p class="double">As she trotted over to the stands, Dash got her own at five hundred miles per hour.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, come on!” Dash shouted. “We have to <i>swim</i>? Wings don’t go well with water!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Come on. Unless you want to forfeit, and I’ll get both Fluttershy <i>and</i> Rarity?”</p><p class="double">“Why did they choose those two, anyway?” Dash muttered.</p><p class="double">“Same race, I think. Anyway, there <i>is</i> another option.”</p><p class="double">“If it means I don’t have to lose, I’ll take it!”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight’s horn flashed.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Shoo ba doo.”</p><p class="double">“Language!” Twilight said. “Right, that spell should wear off in another ten minutes. And at least you got third place!”</p><p class="double">“Bloop.” Rainbow flipped her seapony&#039;s fins, and gave Twilight a dirty look.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash, go!”</p><p class="double">Dash took off like a rocket, flew over the maze and grabbed the trophy. There was a surge of motion, and she was in a graveyard.</p><p class="double">Two seconds later Twilight teleported in next to her. “Hi, Rainbow. Yeah, this is Little Hangleton alright. Hang on a sec, I’ll get the others.”</p><p class="double">Twilight flashed away again.</p><p class="double">A high, cold voice shouted something, and Dash collapsed.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">She came around a minute later, tied to a gravestone.</p><p class="double">“Do you have any idea how long I’ve waited for this, Rainbow Dash? Your mother-”</p><p class="double">Twilight, Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy and Pinkie materialized next to her, and Twilight severed the ropes holding Dash in place. “Here, catch.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow grabbed the flying necklace out of the air and slipped it on. “Right, let’s do this!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, what are those?” Voldemort asked, before he and his lackey Crouch got a faceful of harmony.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Five… six…” Twilight ticked off a list. “Last one left’s the Ring.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Dash frowned. “Aren’t I supposed to be one?”</p><p class="double">“Not after using the Elements. I blasted it with a side beam – it didn’t stand a chance.”</p><p class="double">“Cool.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Hey, Fluttershy! I’m going to need Chompy’s help!” Twilight called.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. “All right. Here, boy! Come on!”</p><p class="double">The Basilisk (wearing a sleeping blindfold) slithered across the Chamber floor and nuzzled Fluttershy, before vanishing with her and Twilight in a flash of light.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“There we go.” Twilight said, carefully lifting the ring out of a box. “Wow, that <i>is</i> pretty impressive…”</p><p class="double">“Twilight?” Fluttershy said. “Stop looking at the ring like that, it’s… er… worrying.”</p><p class="double">Chompy rolled his blindfolded eyes, then spat a glob of venom at the hovering ring. It hissed, and exploded.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Ergh. Sorry, I wasn’t ready for it. The others were a lot easier. Anyway, it’s almost the start of year five now, so we finished just in time.”</p><p class="double">“Yay.” Fluttershy cheered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">2.10 (Finagle007 from SpaceBattles)</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Congratulations upon your graduation. Team One will be... Applejack, Fluttershy, and Rarity, jonin sensei Luna.&quot; Iruka proudly announced, with a wide smile on his face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay,&quot; Fluttershy whispered, while Applejack and Rarity&#039;s faces lit up like the sun.</p><p class="double">&quot;Team Two...&quot; Iruka continued, &quot;Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle, jonin sensei Celestia – what the-!&quot;</p><p class="double">With an almighty crash, a terrified and slightly burned Jiraiya came hurtling through the window, pursued by a furious (and damp) Celestia and Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;HOW DAREST THOU SPY UPON US WHILST WE RELAX IN THE HOT SPRINGS, VILE PERVERT!&quot; Luna boomed, Royal Canterlot Voice in full effect.</p><p class="double">Jiraiya hopped back onto his feet and started to dance. &quot;I&#039;m no pervert, I&#039;m a <i>super</i> - YOW!

<p>3.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Twilight!”</p><p class="double">“What is it, Dash?” Twilight turned from where the Alicorn Amulet was under the microscope.</p><p class="double">“I want to be able to become an alicorn, like you can. I’m already the most awesome pegasus, what’s wrong with becoming the most awesome alicorn?”</p><p class="double">“…right.” Twilight pulled out a notebook. “Cadence told me how she ascended… let’s see…”</p><p class="double">A flash of light enveloped them both. When it faded, Dash found herself on a small island in the middle of the ocean. Strangely, it was now night-time.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight said. “Summon the Element of Loyalty.”</p><p class="double">Dash frowned, and the lightning-bolt necklace burst into existence.</p><p class="double">“Good. Now, then. I am going to post a letter in twenty minutes that insults the Wonderbolts and calls them second-rate losers. It is in your name. If you want to stop it, you will have to get back to Ponyville before then.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus’ eyes widened. “That’s cruel and unusual punishment, Twilight! I don’t even know where we are!”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a wicked grin. “It doesn’t matter. Go straight in any direction from here and you’ll get to Ponyville. Just hurry – we’re on the other side of the planet.”</p><p class="double">She vanished in another purple flicker.</p><p class="double">Dash stared dumbfounded for a second, then shot into the air with a thunderclap of displaced air and broke the sound barrier before she’d gone a hundred metres.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Okay, I’m going at about two thousand miles an hour, and I need to go… a lot faster than that.</i> Dash’s wings blurred as she kept ramping up the speed. Weather magic reached out in front of her and pushed the air aside, and more pushed her from behind.</p><p class="double">There was a sudden burst of multicoloured fire, blinding her, so she closed her eyes and pushed harder.</p><p class="double">Behind the pegasus, the plasma sheath recombined back into air molecules. And around her neck, the Element of Loyalty began to faintly glow.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Squinting against the wind and the heat, Dash looked down.</p><p class="double">There was land, then water… then land again. <i>Huh. I always thought the ocean was wider than that.</i></p><p class="double">The prairie around Appleoosa blurred past, too fast for her to spot the town, and then she was coming into Ponyville and <i>oh buck slow down-</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight dove for cover.</p><p class="double">What looked for all the world like a meteorite shot overhead, set fire to the library, and embedded itself in the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna shot upright in bed. “WHAT VILLAIN HATH DESTROYED MINE SPARE ROOM?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight leant over the hole. “Hey, Rainbow?”</p><p class="double">A groan answered her.</p><p class="double">“There’s some bad news, and some good news. I’ll give you the bad news first.”</p><p class="double">What sounded like a more resigned mumble.</p><p class="double">“Right. The bad news is, you obliterated your house on the way into town, broke every window and set fire to my house on the way through, and I think Applejack’s going to be annoyed about half her orchard as soon as she works out what happened. And you’re a hundred metres deep in a mountain.”</p><p class="double">“What’s the good news?” Rainbow asked, a little more coherently this time.</p><p class="double">“Well, you’re embedded a hundred metres deep in a mountain that you hit at seventy times the speed of sound, and you’re still alive. I think it worked.”</p><p class="double">“It did?” A blue blur came flying out of the hole, flipped, and landed next to Twilight. Rainbow Dash had indeed picked up a horn.</p><p class="double">“Right. That’s a check, then. It looks like I was right!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, what?” Dash looked at Twilight. “I thought you said you knew how this worked.”</p><p class="double">“Well, guessed…” Twilight shrugged. “Basically, from what Cadence said, it looks like becoming an alicorn involves both an action that’s related to the extreme edge of your capabilities – with your special talent involved, of course – and a magical catalyst, like a lump of Heart stone… or an Element of Harmony.”</p><p class="double">Dash pointed her new horn at Twilight. “You tricked me!”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Twilight grinned. “Had to, or it wouldn’t have worked. I think.”</p><p class="double">The new alicorn sighed. “Okay, what’s next?”</p><p class="double">“Well, hopefully you won’t need to hit that kind of speed to reascend. I think once you’ve done it once it gets easier. I’m going to teach you Star Swirl’s spell, because that’s the only thing I know that can <i>un</i>do a transition to alicornhood, and we’ll test if you can do it with just the Element alone.”</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed. “But we might need to do that next loop. I think we finally found out what it takes to turn Ponyville into an angry mob.”</p><p class="double">Dash followed the pointing hoof, and saw Big Mac passing out torches and pitchforks with an amiable air.</p><p class="double">“They’re not all that angry…” she said critically.</p><p class="double">“Well, explaining <i>would</i> be awkward.” Twilight countered.</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Alright, what’s the plan?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn pondered. “Well, that island I teleported you to was nice…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “-last forever!”</p><p class="double">Twilight released her spell, and then released the parasprites. Four of the little magical bugs flew forwards, looked around for something they considered to be “food”, then locked onto the only thing that currently qualified.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon’s armour.</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight said, watching as Nightmare Moon ran in and out of doors, pursued by a gradually growing cloud of parasprites and slowly losing her armour. “It <i>is</i> funny when I’m not worried about them eating the town.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie pulled a saxophone from somewhere, and started playing a raspy piece of music that seemed very appropriate. Especially when Nightmare Moon went into one door, and then came out of the other side of the street two seconds later.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight tuned out Chrysalis’ ranting about how she’d be trapped in the old mines forever.</p><p class="double">She was just waiting for the fireworks to start. Thanks to a single forged invitation, a bit of careful magic, and quite a lot of boredom…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis finished belittling the annoying little purple unicorn, and closed the connection. <i>Ah, that was good</i>.</p><p class="double">She’d had a point, though. It wouldn’t do to let the quality of her disguise slip, not this close to her triumph.</p><p class="double">Checking in the mirror, she adjusted a few very minor details. The hair colour, the precise shape of the horn, and the coverts on the wings.</p><p class="double">Green magic couldn’t be avoided, so she was being careful only to use it on Shining Armor – that one was so out of his gourd much of the time he probably wouldn’t have noticed if she’d detransformed.</p><p class="double">Then, a wash of something… unusual came across her empathic senses. It didn’t feel like a pony, that was for sure.</p><p class="double"><b>“Crystals…”</b></p><p class="double">Chrysalis turned, to see an unusual looking dark unicorn with an aquiline bearing.</p><p class="double">“Who the hell are you?”</p><p class="double">The connection to the purple unicorn reopened without her touching it. “Just to let you know, his name is Sombra. He’s the pony who took over the Crystal Empire. As far as he’s concerned, he’s finally found you – you being Cadance – and is going to… yeah, probably try and drain your magic, at the very least.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Imponysonating someone with their own problems is a right bitch, isn’t it?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The room of Princess Cadance exploded in a fountain of black and green magic.</p><p class="double">Everyone turned, shocked, to see Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and an unknown black unicorn locked in a spectacular magical battle. Cadance’ form was flickering, as though it was being projected onto a sheet of cloth in a high wind, and black chitin occasionally showed through.</p><p class="double">“What the hell?” Celestia said, trying to make out what was going on through the storm of magic. “Isn’t that… Sombra?”</p><p class="double">Twilight materialized next to her, with a badly exhausted Cadance along for the ride. “Hi, Princess. I found the real one! Where’d my brother get to?”</p><p class="double">The Solar alicorn reacted automatically, pointing to the startled looking guard captain in a nearby plaza.</p><p class="double">“Thanks! Right, hang on a sec, I’ll go get him.”</p><p class="double">Twilight galloped off.</p><p class="double">Cadance looked up at the explosions. “That <i>does</i> simplify my situation a bit, actually. I was wondering how we were going to handle Sombra.”</p><p class="double">A badly singed piece of gold-chased card fluttered down from above. Celestia took it in her grip. “Er… <i>Dear King Sombra. You are cordially invited to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and someone you probably don’t care about. Her room is shown on the included map. Yours, Twilight Sparkle.</i> Twilight did this?”</p><p class="double">The pink alicorn shrugged. “Like I know. I’ve spent the last two months in a mine. By the way, how’s the wedding planning going?”</p><p class="double">“You’re still worried about that?” Overhead, Chrysalis dropped her shapeshift and started to concentrate on pure firepower.</p><p class="double">“I have spent two months trapped in a mine.” Cadance enunciated clearly. “I have spent a <i>lot</i> of time dreaming about that wedding. If you tell me it is going to be called off because of something so minor as a <i>war</i>, then I think I might cause you and Luna to both fall in love. With the same stallion. That one from Cloudsdale with the giant biceps.”</p><p class="double">Celestia shuddered. “All right, point taken.”</p><p class="double">Hundreds of changelings shot into the air from all over Canterlot, hurrying to reinforce their queen, then got bowled backwards by a colossal blast of air.</p><p class="double">“Has Sombra even noticed that the pony he’s fighting doesn’t look like you any more?” Celestia asked, suddenly curious.</p><p class="double">“I doubt it. He never was all that observant.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Well, this is a fine mess you’ve gotten us into.” Chrysalis grumbled, staring down at Equestria hanging below them.</p><p class="double"><b>“Crystals?”</b></p><p class="double">“Oh, shut up.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.4</p><p class="double">“Twiiiliiight?” the blue alicorn moaned.</p><p class="double">“What is it, Dash?”</p><p class="double">“I’m bored.”</p><p class="double">“Well, sorry, but it’s taking me quite a lot of concentration to maintain this stability bubble.” Twilight flared her wings, slammed her forehooves onto the floor, and a magic circle bloomed out from her to five lengths in every direction. “There. Now, Dash, can’t you be at least a bit serious?”</p><p class="double">“Why?” Rainbow Dash countered.</p><p class="double">“We’re in the past. A <i>long</i> way in the past, in case you hadn’t noticed.” A raven shaped like a writing desk flapped past.</p><p class="double">“I never was much of a fan of history.” Dash shrugged.</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “I’d think even <i>you</i> would remember about how Discord was in charge before the Royal Sisters showed up.”</p><p class="double">“Huh. So we’re that far back? Be neat to see what the Princesses looked like when they were younger.”</p><p class="double">“No, you’re not getting it.” Twilight pointed from her to Dash. “<i>We’re</i> the Sisters this time. We’ve replaced Celestia and Luna.”</p><p class="double">“…huh.” Dash absorbed that for a while. “Dibs on being Luna!”</p><p class="double">“Why?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Dash said, as if talking to a filly. “Luna gets a thousand year nap.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Oh, what a world, what a world… my only regret is, that I never got to… sing! I am the enemy, I will succeed…”</p><p class="double">Twilight tried to ignore Discord’s blathering. <i>How long is this going to take?</i></p><p class="double">“Twi! Can’t you make those elements go any faster?”</p><p class="double">“I’m not used to using Honesty and Generosity, Dash! You should know how hard it is to use Elements you’re not used to!”</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged, then wobbled and shifted to make sure the pair of necklaces around her wings didn’t fall off. “Laughter seems to like me.”</p><p class="double">Stone crept another inch up Discord’s mismatched legs.</p><p class="double">“…couldn’t you have come up with a better way of wearing these, than putting them around-“</p><p class="double">“We are <i>not</i> having this argument again, Rainbow Dash!” Twilight snapped. “I didn’t see you coming up with any better options!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">An excruciating half hour later, Discord was finally sealed.</p><p class="double">“<i>Me</i>, but that took too long.” Dash panted.</p><p class="double">“I know… wait.” Twilight looked over suspiciously at her ‘sister’. “Did you just use ‘me’ as an oath?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” Rainbow replied. “Why not?”</p><p class="double">“…never mind. Anyway…” Twilight pointed over to a growing crowd of ponies in the distance. “I think it’s time for our first public appearance.”</p><p class="double">Dash looked at her, confused. “What do you mean?”</p><p class="double">“Well, we beat Discord, now we have to set up the government of Equestria. That means paperwork.”</p><p class="double">The former pegasus gagged. “Can I launch my coup now? Please? I want to relax on the moon!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.5</p><p class="double">“We don’t have all day, Miss Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked, disoriented for a moment as the Loop began. <i>Where the hell am I? I hope it’s…</i></p><p class="double">Then she saw the egg in front of her. <i>Oh, cool. The entrance exam.</i></p><p class="double">Having researched it, Twilight knew that technically there <i>was</i> no one answer to the exam. You were basically supposed to show your ingenuity. The examiners were even allowed to offer advice if you asked.</p><p class="double">But… that was boring.</p><p class="double">With a crackle, she fired an age alteration spell at Spike’s egg. Carefully modulating it to overcome the natural magical resistance all dragons had, she aged the egg in a matter of seconds to the point it hatched.</p><p class="double">Out of the corner of her eye, she saw that several of the unicorn examiners had dropped their clipboards in shock. Her parents were a little startled too.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, yeah, that’s a high level spell. Ah well.</i></p><p class="double">“Did I do alright?”</p><p class="double">A tingling in her flank reminded her that she also had the nearly-unique experience of getting her cutie mark for a second time. Twilight more or less ignored what everyone else in the room was saying to meticulously examine how the magic worked.</p><p class="double"><i>Hmm… that’s five thousand words of thesis that need to be rewritten…</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Huh.” Rarity said, and shrugged. “So much for being pulled sideways. Suppose knowing what my talent is going to be helps.”</p><p class="double">Whistling to herself, she started digging gems out of the ground and constructing a dress. “Wonder if I can make enchanted items without it being too suspicious. Perhaps a Cape of Charisma?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy awoke falling out of the sky. Shaking off her brief daze, she frowned. While getting to know her animal friends was nice, she didn’t feel like quitting. <i>Not this time.</i></p><p class="double">While the demure pegasus wasn’t nearly as fast as Rainbow Dash, neither was anyone else. She still got back to the academy faster than she’d been falling.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dash hit the sound barrier almost as soon as she became conscious. Seeing that Fluttershy could handle herself, she made a u-turn and aimed <i>up</i>.</p><p class="double">A column of rainbow fire shot into the air over the Young Fliers’ Academy, climbing quickly until it was above the clouds. Now too far to be seen from the ground, she went Alicorn, wrapped herself in air, and accelerated.</p><p class="double"><i>Let’s see just how high I can go!</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Hey, Mum, Dad, Inkie, Blinkie, watch this!”</p><p class="double">There was a thunderous explosion, and it started to rain chocolate.</p><p class="double">“Pinkamena, what on this good green Equestria was that?” Clyde asked, coughing in the clouds of sugar.</p><p class="double">“It’s my patent pending Pinkie Pie Cotton Candy Cloud Contraption!” Pinkie rattled off, bouncing. “It’s fuelled by Peridot, Calcite and earth magic!”</p><p class="double">Inkie stuck out a tongue. “Hey, this tastes of strawberry.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie kicked at the field. “Well, I didn’t have much chance to do taste testing… I was aiming for banana and chocolate.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I like them.” Clyde said. “Good of you to think of me like that.”</p><p class="double">“I try!” Pinkie beamed.</p><p class="double">“So, how’d you find the time to build this? Ah hope the chores are done.”</p><p class="double">“I did my chores before I got to work.” Butter wouldn’t have melted in Pinkie’s mouth. It was even true – she’d finished it last Loop, but hadn’t found enough calcite. “Hey, why don’t we have a party to celebrate?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Ah do still want to come and see y’all, aunt Orange.” Applejack said. “Ah just don’t want to forget the farm, and all. How’s about ah spend the harvest ‘n plantin’ down there, and ah come here for the growin’ season?”</p><p class="double">Valencia Orange clapped her hooves together. “That <i>does</i> sound nice. We’ll be waiting, then.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight said, looking around the abandoned Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters that night. “Everypony happy with what they’ve done?”</p><p class="double">There was general assent. Fluttershy raised a hoof. “For some reason, er, my cutie mark is a bit different. Do you know why?”</p><p class="double">Twilight checked. “Oh, yeah, it is. Interesting. Well, butterfly with speed lines is close to your original one.”</p><p class="double">She then rounded on Dash. “And what were <i>you</i> thinking?”</p><p class="double">“I wanted to go as high as I possibly could!” the alicornified filly answered.</p><p class="double">“Dash, I had to rescue from <i>orbit</i>. Now, you can’t go back until you’ve managed to untransform – it’ll be strange enough that you hit escape velocity.” Twilight sighed. “Okay. Here’s my plan. We basically all get lost in a few days, somehow, and each of us turns up back at home half an hour later with our Element – we say we just found them somewhere. That should mean Celestia intervenes and gets us introduced to one another.”</p><p class="double">“That makes sense.” Applejack nodded. “Don’t she know where the Elements are supposed to be, and all?”</p><p class="double">“Well, the Element of Magic starts a Loop nowhere at all. I asked about that once – apparently they do sometimes just disappear, when they’re not attuned.” Twilight looked from one face to the next. “Anything else?”</p><p class="double">There wasn’t.</p><p class="double">“Okay. The rest of you can leave – Rarity, you can get them home, right?” Rarity nodded, building magic for a series of teleports. “Good. Dash, pay attention!”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash kicked the floor. “Aw, shucks. Okay, let’s try this.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Several years later…</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon crept into Ponyville. This was the pathetic town that her sister’s Summer Sun celebration was to be held at this year… the perfect place to announce her return.</p><p class="double">Bursting through the curtain, she began to laugh – then slowed, as she realized something was just not right.</p><p class="double">Nopony was running. Nopony was screaming. And there was a giant banner announcing that ‘the Elements of Harmony’ were in Ponyville for the Summer Sun concert along with Celestia.</p><p class="double">“Er…” Nightmare said, looking around and spotting the six ponies wearing Element regalia. “…wrong stage?”</p><p class="double">A pink pony wearing what looked like her version of the Element of Laughter trotted over. “Yeah, I think it might actually be the wrong <i>night</i>. I don’t know how you got confused, but the special Nightmare Night stage show isn’t for another four months.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Moon tried to play along. “Sorry?”</p><p class="double">“It’s good your costume is so well done, though. That’ll be a great help.” The pony smiled knowingly. “Tell you what, I’ll walk you home later. Just sit in the audience with us for now.”</p><p class="double">Bemused, Nightmare Moon followed her off the stage. Somehow, she couldn’t help but feel like this wasn’t in the script…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.6 (Metal Wolf Chaos)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, Twilight, what’s on my appointments for today?” Rainbow Dash asked.</p><p class="double">“Uh… looks like you have an interview with diplomats from Saddle Arabia over scheduling a Wonderbolts show in their capital.” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">Dash piloted her giant mecha forwards. “Sorry, I’ll have to cancel that. I’m off to SAVE EQUESTRIA!”</p><p class="double">As the robot went to town on an entire small army, Twilight rubbed her temple with a hoof. “Something is seriously off about this Loop…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “GIIIILDAAAAAA!” Dash roared, surfing out of the sky on a hunk of metal.</p><p class="double">“RAAAINBOW DAAAAASH!” Gilda roared back, igniting the jets on her own giant robot and rocketing up to intercept her.</p><p class="double">Twilight quietly let herself out of her prison cell. “Honestly. Did someone let Dash write the script for this one?”</p><p class="double">Though she had to admit, the gigantic energy cannon on top of Canterlot Castle was actually pretty cool.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.7 (gen 2)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Note to self.” Twilight said. “<i>Stop having Discord try on the Elements of Harmony!”</i></p><p class="double">She crumpled up the paper she was working on, wished once more that she had a <i>horn</i> in this Loop, and tried to work out what clothes wouldn’t get her laughed at.</p><p class="double">When she’d discovered that this Loop involved high school, she was cautiously optimistic. But then it had turned out that the actual lessons part of high school was almost irrelevant – instead, every other pony in the entire school seemed to consider dates, boys (or girls) and dresses much more important.</p><p class="double">And for some reason every pony was bipedal, which felt <i>weird</i>.</p><p class="double">Once more, she tried to use magic – both unicorn and otherwise – and came up blank.</p><p class="double">“I wouldn’t mind so much if the lessons were actually interesting… it’s like someone made the school just for the dating…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.8 (Law and Order)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Detective Rainbow Dash looked over at her counterpart, as she closed the cell door. “So, was it him?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Detective Applejack replied. “It’s him alright. But we kin hardly say in court that ah ‘just knew he was lyin’ with my magical honesty powers’, can we?”</p><p class="double">“Guess not.” Dash kicked the wall in frustration. “I still say we should have kicked him around a bit.”</p><p class="double">“That ain’t legal, Dash.” AJ replied sternly.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah. At least we managed to get him in on suspicion.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Right.” Twilight adjusted her lab coat and glasses. “Okay, DNA analysis, fibre matching and a hoofprint check… that’ll take a week or two.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Dash said, shocked. “You kidding me?”</p><p class="double">“Well, if I actually had to use the equipment normally it would.” Twilight lit her horn, and the computer began flickering through databases. “Good thing I can just use <i>magic</i>.”</p><p class="double">There was a <i>ding</i> as the computer spat out a hoofprint match. The DNA analyzer was next, and began printing a list of concordances.</p><p class="double">“Wonder how they do it on the human TV shows…”</p><p class="double">“Ah think they just make it up, Twilight.” Applejack said, deadpan.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that’s disappointing.” Twilight picked up the sheaf of papers. “Right, that’s a good match on the hoofprint, complete on the DNA, and the fibres are from the same batch of material. But that’s all circumstantial.”</p><p class="double">“That’ll be enough.” Applejack grinned. “With <i>our</i> prosecution lawyer.”</p><p class="double">It was nice to know more than Twilight about a given Loop for once – though if this were a CSI partial fusion rather than a Law and Order partial fusion (Twilight having identified the differences) then they’d have just been watching Twilight do everything <i>again.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “The prosecution may cross-examine the defendant.”</p><p class="double">“…thank you.” District Attorney Fluttershy stood up, her wig slightly askew. “Now, mister Striking Sparks, I have an important question for you. Please listen carefully, and answer correctly... if that&#039;s alright, that is.” She gave him a look. “You are accused of grand larceny of jewellery from the shop of one Rarity Belle. Did you do it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Striking Sparks stared back, looking straight at her. The defence lawyer frowned, confused by the tactics being employed by the gentle pegasus.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Yes! Oh, I&#039;ve wasted my LIFE!&quot; Striking Sparks broke down sobbing. “I did it. I stole all the diamonds I could carry from that shop! I hid them in a flat belonging to my brother-in-law at the corner of ninth and main, on the sixth floor, flat D. It’s the sixth time I’ve stolen in five years, and I’ll give you the list of where everything else went and who helped me!”</p><p class="double">“Wow.” Dash muttered, up in the gallery. “That’s one hell of a Stare she has now.”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Applejack nodded. “Ah helped her practice it all last Loop.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.9 (Power Rangers)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Welcome, ponies.” Celestia’s voice boomed from some kind of magical portal in the centre of the room. “I have brought you here to become the Elements of Harmony.”</p><p class="double">All six Loopers looked between themselves, and eventually shrugged. <i>Meh, may as well go with it.</i></p><p class="double">“I and my sister were caught in a time warp by King Sombra in the distant past. He is trapped, but his wife Chrysalis has been sending out bands of Changelings to attack Equestria.” Celestia continued.</p><p class="double">“Wait, hold on a second.” Dash said. “<i>Wife?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Luna replied from inside the same portal. “Their wedding was quite nice, actually, but the reception was when the vagabonds struck.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway.” Celestia overrode her sister. “The six gemstones before you are ancient magical artefacts. You can use them to become the Elements of Harmony, and fight off the Changelings.”</p><p class="double">“What crystals?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">There was a muttered argument in much quieter voices, then Celestia shouted again. “Spike!”</p><p class="double">The dragon poked his head out of a door. “Yes?”</p><p class="double">“Go get the Elements.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry…” he disappeared into the back room, and came out again a few seconds later with a pile of gemstones. “Ai yi yi…”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Celestia said, after they’d arrived. “Sorry about that. Now, er, take up the Elements, and save Equestria!”</p><p class="double">Twilight moved forward, and picked one up in her magic. “I don’t see we have much choice, really…”</p><p class="double">The others followed her and picked up their relevant gems – each one a jewel cut stone, but the same colour as the Elements they were used to.</p><p class="double">“Now.” Luna added. “To transform, say-”</p><p class="double">“NO.” Celestia interrupted her. “You don’t have to say Morphing Time, Power On, or whatever it was you were going to tell them! Just concentrate on the gem.”</p><p class="double">All six nodded, and the gems glowed in unison.</p><p class="double">“I wanted them to be called the Pony Rangers.” Luna sulked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Oh.” Twilight said, staring up at the eighty foot tall Changeling standing in the middle of Manehattan. “That’s new.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, Twilight! Don’t be so upset!” Pinkie shouted from behind her. “Look!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned, and looked up. And up. And up again for good measure.</p><p class="double">“We get a <i>giant robot!</i>” Dash and Pinkie shouted in perfect unison.</p><p class="double">“…where’d that come from!?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Spike gave us the keys to a garage after you left, and there were five giant robot animals in it! I just put them together like a jigsaw puzzle!”</p><p class="double">“Now, Rarity!” Rainbow said, apparently driving the robot that was making the head. “Form emerald sword!”</p><p class="double">“Can you even <i>do</i> that?” Twilight asked, then blinked. “Huh. Apparently yes.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “I have returned!” Sombra shouted. “Now, <i>dearest</i>, why didn’t you try to free me from the moon?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis gave him a toothy grin. “Well, you needed your beauty sleep, dear. A thousand years wasn’t <i>nearly </i>enough.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you are evil.” The king tossed his head. “But I like you. For some reason.”</p><p class="double">“You only married me for my enormous horde of interchangeable minions.” Chrysalis accused, then shrugged. “Eh. I’d have done the same. Now, where should we attack next?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There was a <i>slam</i>, as Sombra bucked down the door of the Elements’ base. &quot;We have captured the pink one! Now, if you want her to live-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Want who to live?&quot; Pinkie said, from behind the others.</p><p class="double">Sombra sighed. &quot;Chrysalis! Next time, capture one of the ones who isn&#039;t pink!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We already tried that with the purple one!&quot; Chrysalis shouted back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Grah.&quot; Sombra turned to the Mane 6. &quot;Which of you can NOT teleport, fly faster than sound, or otherwise easily escape?&quot;</p><p class="double">Everypony pointed at Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you for your assistance. We&#039;ll see you in a week or two.&quot; Sombra trotted out again, and was wreathed in black shadow which dissolved to nothing.</p><p class="double">“Should we have told them that?” Fluttershy asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep.” AJ replied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “This is hopeless!” Chrysalis said. “I mean, LOOK!”</p><p class="double">Sombra followed his wife’s pointing hoof. “Are those changelings… holding their hooves over their ears?”</p><p class="double">“<i>No</i>. Chrysalis replied, simmering. “<i>Because they don’t have them.</i> That batch don’t have ears, and she’s <i>still</i> whining enough to annoy them!”</p><p class="double">“Should we just send her back?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. “Go ahead. I give up. There’s no point trying to capture them. Let’s just try more giant armies.”</p><p class="double">“I did have a plan to make <i>evil</i> Elements…” Sombra mused. “We could try that?”</p><p class="double">After a pause, Chrysalis thwapped him with her wing. “That’s stupid. But… actually… hmmm. Do we still have Discord’s phone number?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Two giant robots wrestled in the ruins of Canterlot.</p><p class="double">Twilight trotted up a nearby hill. “Hi, Chrysalis, Sombra, Discord.”</p><p class="double">“Grah.” Sombra said, then Chrysalis shook her head at him. “Sorry. Hello.”</p><p class="double">“Where did you get this idea from?” Before them, the Megalicorn picked up half of Canterlot Castle and used it as a bludgeon against the Dark Changewing.</p><p class="double">Discord pointed at himself. “The giant robot was all <i>moi</i>.”</p><p class="double">“And Sombra here came up with the idea of negative Elements. Speaking of which…” Chrysalis looked around. “Where <i>is</i> the Element of Dark Magic?”</p><p class="double">Sombra burped.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear…” Chrysalis shook her head. “You just couldn’t resist, could you?”</p><p class="double">“Sorry.”</p><p class="double">There was an explosion of red magic, and Trixie appeared. “Trixie found a replacement!” The alicorn amulet swung from her neck. “And is this Trixie’s counterpart?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight nodded. “Look, can we skip the normal fight and get straight onto the giant robot one?”</p><p class="double">Trixie mulled it over. “Trixie thinks this is acceptable. Wagonlord, form!”</p><p class="double">A gigantic thing of wood and canvas rose from the ground, held in Trixie’s telekinetic grip.</p><p class="double">“Right… Spikezilla!”</p><p class="double">Sombra turned to Chrysalis. “Don’t you miss the days when battles were <i>small?</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.4 part 2 (from Madfish)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;…And so, in her boredom, Princess Rainbow took to pranking the whole of Equestria, until a particularly humorous jape on the Elements of Harmony themselves resulted in them giving her a timeout on the moon. But it is said that after one thousand years pass she will return, completing her Final Joke of Doom.&quot; </p><p class="double">Finishing reading that last line, the personal student of Princess Twilight, Society of Creative Anachronisms member and self styled &#039;Knight of the Arcane&#039; Luna did the maths on her abacus. Checking it twice, she came up with a four digit number that she found extremely worrying.</p><p class="double">&quot;Forsooth!&quot; she swore, grabbed the abacus and book with her telekinesis, and took off at a gallop. Somepony called out to her, but she shot past too fast to catch what was said. She was on a mission! Her liege needed to be warned!</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;We must be prepared, Squire Spike! This must be a test of our ability; we will complete the tasks that will keep the expectant populace calm while our liege prepareths for the unknown Final Joke.&quot; Luna expounded.</p><p class="double">“Prepareths?” Spike said, dubiously. “I don’t think that’s a word. And stop calling me Squire.”</p><p class="double">“But ‘tis thy rank, is it not, brave Spike?”</p><p class="double">“Well-”</p><p class="double">The lengthy argument over the precise definition of ‘squire’ as opposed to ‘armsdragon’, ‘courtier’, ‘page’ and ‘overly romantic unicorn’ continued for most of the trip to Ponyville.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “The ponies who inhabit this town are truly unhinged.” Luna said, shaking her head. “What remains to be done, Squire?”</p><p class="double">Spike rolled his eyes. “The main remaining issue is the weather. If Princess Twilight’s cometary display is to be properly seen, the weather has to be perfect.”</p><p class="double">“Verily.” Luna nodded.</p><p class="double">“That’d be my job!” A white pegasus landed next to them. “Hi! My name is Celestia. My special talent is to remove clouds from the sky. Watch!”</p><p class="double">The pegasus flared her wings, darted into the air, and spun in place twice. Air shot out in lumps, smashed into various small clouds, and made them fall apart.</p><p class="double">“There!”</p><p class="double">Luna closed her mouth. “’twas most impressive, fair Celestia.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you flatter me.” Celestia shook her tricoloured mane. “Oh, are you here for the sky display?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn nodded. “Indeed, though-”</p><p class="double">“I love it!” Celestia said, speaking over the top of Luna. “Especially when the sun rises right at the end, and it makes the colours of the sky change from deepest black and violet right through the spectrum to blue!”</p><p class="double">“…agreed.” Luna looked over at Spike, unsure.</p><p class="double">“But don’t let me keep you.” Celestia added. “I’ll keep an eye out for you tomorrow.”</p><p class="double">In a blur of white, she shot off.</p><p class="double">“That was strange.” Luna muttered. “Another for the theory that ponies here are a little crazy.” She spotted Spike snickering. “Er, ahem, I mean… lord, what fools these ponies be.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The six Elements of Harmony blasted their foe, enveloping Danger Dash in rainbow light.</p><p class="double">When it faded, what stood there was a blue alicorn barely taller than any of the six Element bearers.</p><p class="double">“It is done.” Luna said, wobbling slightly on her hooves. “Repent, blaggard, or-”</p><p class="double">“I hope you’ve learned your lesson.”</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight materialized abruptly in the hall, and every pony bowed automatically.</p><p class="double">“Oh, rise, all of you.” Twilight said, shaking her head. “All of you, in particular, deserve not to bow to me. You’ve managed to knock some sense into my sister, Princess Rainbow Dash.”</p><p class="double">“Twi.” Dash said, staggering over. “Worst. Time. Out. Ever.”</p><p class="double">The purple alicorn frowned, a little put off. “How so?”</p><p class="double">“The Elements kept me awake! All thousand years. Every time I dropped off to sleep, there was this <i>bzzz</i> and they woke me up again! I just came back because I wanted to <i>shut them up!</i>” Dash ranted. “Now, get out of the way of that window. I’m going to go into my room, and I am going to go to <i>sleep</i>, and I am going to not come out again until… until… what’s a good holiday after midsummer?”</p><p class="double">“That’d be the Day of Danger, when we fire off fireworks by the tonne.” Princess Twilight said. “It was supposed to be in memory of you, but I think it turned into ‘we need to keep her distracted with shiny things so she doesn’t prank us’.”</p><p class="double">“Right. That. Anyway, don’t wake me until the Day of Danger, the one <i>after</i> next.” Princess Dash shot off at two hundred miles an hour, barely moving by her standards.</p><p class="double">“Wow. She really <i>is</i> off her game…” Twilight muttered. “Anyway, where were we?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.10</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia couldn’t help but think something was a little off about her favoured student.</p><p class="double">Not only had she found the Elements of Harmony with frankly slightly disconcerting speed, but she’d also assembled a team of ponies who were fully compatible with them so fast that she’d managed to catch Nightmare Moon <i>on the way down</i>.</p><p class="double">Then she’d begun doing some extremely esoteric research into pegasus magic, material that Celestia found herself totally unable to follow. Something about “interferometry with standing waves of magic forming in the pinnules”.</p><p class="double">Still, at least she seemed happy. But it was getting a little worrying how vague her reports were about the occasional trouble going on in Ponyville…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Flim and Flam materialized with their cart in a large, grey-floored room.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hello.” A blue unicorn said, looking up and adjusting her large hat. “Trixie sees that Twilight Sparkle got disturbed when doing research again.”</p><p class="double">Next to them, a huge crate of food slammed to the floor.</p><p class="double">“Right. Trixie will show you around. This is the mezzanine level. A large number of rooms are provided on the upper floors, and the lower floors are where the space suits are kept.”</p><p class="double">“The what?” Flim asked.</p><p class="double">“Space suits. Did Trixie stutter?”</p><p class="double">“Trix…” A griffin stepped out of a nearby door. “You have to <i>explain</i> things to the newbies. Hi, I’m Gilda. This is a moon base, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“We’re on the moon?” Flam said, shocked.</p><p class="double">“Everyone – pony, griffin, or whatever – who annoys Twilight Sparkle too much ends up here.” Gilda shrugged. “I have to admit, it <i>is</i> pretty cool. And honestly… I pissed off a pony who teleported me to the <i>moon</i>, and provided a base. She could have done worse.”</p><p class="double">“Why are you so accepting of this?” Flim said.</p><p class="double">Trixie pointed to some much larger doors. “That… would be the spaceship in the hanger over there. Trixie calls dibs on captain as soon as we have enough to crew it.” She looked sullen. “Trixie could totally have run it by herself, but the computers demand a minimum crew size.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Flam said, after contemplating that with his brother for a moment. “That <i>is</i> pretty cool.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Er…” Rarity ventured. “Where <i>are</i> you sending them all?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Space camp.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">3.5 part 2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon stayed shrunk into her seat as much as possible the whole time Celestia was on stage, only beginning to relax when the elder alicorn finally left.</p><p class="double">“So, er…” she cast around for a topic. “What do you all do, then?”</p><p class="double">Apparently her conversation skills weren’t great after so long on the moon.</p><p class="double">“Well,” the pink pony started. “I’m Pinkie Pie, and I’m in charge of Pie Enterprises. Well baked ideas for any occasion! Here, have a moondial.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare caught the strange device, which had a triangle on it. “…right. What do I do with it?”</p><p class="double">“Put it on your lower foreleg, silly!” Pinkie said, holding up her own to demonstrate.</p><p class="double">Still feeling a little silly, Nightmare complied. The triangle spun around a few times, then stopped, and cast a shadow despite there being nothing to cause it.</p><p class="double">“It shows the time by using the position of the moon! Look, it has the phases, too!” Pinkie pointed to the orange pony next to her. “This is Applejack.”</p><p class="double">“Charmed.” Applejack said, nodding to her.</p><p class="double">“She’s kinda-sorta-got a financial lock on the majority of farming in the country.” Pinkie said. “I’ve seen her speak to farmers and Manehattan socialites in their own styles without missing a beat!”</p><p class="double">The blue pegasus butted in. “I’m Rainbow Dash, <i>official</i> fastest pony on the planet. I do space missions!”</p><p class="double">“…how?” Nightmare asked, feeling a little overwhelmed.</p><p class="double">“I fly up!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare waited. “Wait. That’s it?”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Dash stretched the word out. “Twi <i>does</i> give me that air bubble spell so I don’t explode, but apart from that it’s all me. I fly up there, drop off a satellite, and come right back down on my own.”</p><p class="double">The purple pony stepped in, seeing their guest a bit lost. “Satellites are something that sits in orbit and transmits or measures things – like radio.”</p><p class="double">“And you invented ‘em, Twilight!” Dash pointed out. “Don’t be modest. Wish you wouldn’t give me so many geostationary ones to lift, though, that is a <i>long</i> way up!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged awkwardly. “It’s the best place…”</p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry, I forgot.” Dash took the conversation over again, making Nightmare look back and forth between them like she was watching a tennis match. “This is my best friend Fluttershy. She’s usually the one who catches me when I come back down again.”</p><p class="double">“That’s just a favour, though…” Fluttershy said. “Normally I work making sure the launch area is nice and clear, and sort out the logistics, and so on. It keeps me run off my hooves, but it’s… good work.”</p><p class="double">“And I know you invent things…” Moon said, pointing to Twilight. “What about the Element of Generosity?”</p><p class="double">“I’m surprised you don’t know.” The white unicorn said. “I am Rarity, Dressmaker and Crafter to her highness, founder and owner of the Rare Materials company and item enchanter extraordinaire. Dear, you <i>do</i> look nice, but that regalia could be enchanted to increase the effect, you know. Make you a <i>much</i> more visually stunning pony.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon felt vaguely insulted. But it <i>was</i> tempting…</p><p class="double">“By the way.” Twilight said causally. “Don’t try anything, Nightmare, or we’ll use the Elements.” Nightmare stiffened in shock, but the six Element bearers stayed perfectly at ease. “So long as you’re not harming any pony, you’ll be fine. Hay, maybe you could try and work through your issues yourself.”</p><p class="double">“Heeey!” Pinkie all but bounced out of her chair. “Maaybe we could go out clubbing tonight! Dash usually does with me, but the others are all such boring stick-in-the-muds.”</p><p class="double">“…clubbing?” Moon asked, rolling the unfamiliar word around in her mouth.</p><p class="double">“Yeah! Night clubs, you know?”</p><p class="double">“This idea intrigues me.” Nightmare admitted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>4.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right.” Dash trotted back and forth in front of the other pegasi. “We have precisely six months until the Grand Galloping Gala. I want us all to be ready.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust sneered. “For what? I thought this was some kind of special flight camp.”</p><p class="double">Other pegasi nodded their agreement, or just rustled their wings awkwardly.</p><p class="double">“I’m glad you asked.” Dash crouched, shot upwards, and broke the sound barrier after about ten seconds before circling around, shedding speed again, and landing in front of them.</p><p class="double">“That is the Sonic Rainboom. Now, the Dash Certificate of Awesomeness is only awarded to those who can pull off a Sonic Rainboom <i>on command.</i>” The rainbow pegasus grinned. “Any other questions?”</p><p class="double">“How the hay did you do that?” a pony halfway to the back blurted.</p><p class="double">“Training. Meticulous training, and being awesome.” Dash’s grin didn’t change. “Now, who doesn’t want to be able to do that? Because you <i>can</i> leave.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“No, no, no!” Dash shook her head in exasperation. “You’re not going to break the sound barrier like that. You have to actually USE the weather magic. Make the wind push you, make it strengthen your wingbeats.”</p><p class="double">“…so <i>that’s</i> how you did that?”</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged. “This isn’t easy stuff.”</p><p class="double">Overhead, Lightning Dust flubbed a wingstroke and bounced off the sound barrier. Fluttershy caught her just before she hit the ground.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Dash grinned. “Yeah, I did that at least a <i>dozen</i> times before I managed to get it right. Don’t worry!”</p><p class="double">“The idea of screwing up a dozen times in a row isn’t a nice one…” Dust muttered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And… go!”</p><p class="double">One by one, fifteen pegasi dropped off the cirrus cloud. Successive <i>booms</i> sounded across the prairie as each left their own individualized explosion of weather magic.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Nice work!” Dash said later, to the exhausted ponies. “Tomorrow we just rest, because we’re doing part of the entertainment for the Grand Galloping Gala.”</p><p class="double">“How?” asked Cloud Dancer.</p><p class="double">“Hell if I know.” Dash shrugged. “Twilight Sparkle gave me the details.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Goodness, Twilight.” Celestia said, watching as the instruments were moved into the dance hall. “That’s a little much, isn’t it?”</p><p class="double">“Well, for the dance music, yes.” Twilight hefted a carillon in a magical grip. “But I’d like to have a piece about halfway through using <i>all</i> of these.”</p><p class="double">“What piece could possibly involve a carillon, a full orchestra and a pipe organ?”</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn grinned to herself. “You’ll see.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Attention, everypony.” Twilight said. “I would like to present a piece of music I researched exhaustively over the last year, the <i>Overture</i>.”</p><p class="double">Rarity looked glad of the distraction from Blueblood. Pinkie and Applejack, meanwhile, were comforting Fluttershy after having made sure she wasn’t going to go after the animals this time.</p><p class="double">Twilight’s horn glowed, and the music began gently with strings.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was having a great deal of fun doing this, actually. Running an entire orchestra – especially doing two counterpointing themes at once – was tricky enough that it was hard for even her to manage properly.</p><p class="double"><i>Maybe I could ask Rarity how she manages so much telekinetic control at once… I’d probably have to wait until she Awakens, of course.</i></p><p class="double">The second theme built towards a crescendo. Unnoticed, she slipped in a little signal spell into the magic she was doing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dash spotted it at once. “That’s the signal! Dust, go! Now Dancer, aaaand… Raindrops!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three explosions sounded over Canterlot in quick succession, making most of the listening ponies jump. Twilight grinned, and then got the carillon going. <i>You thought that was surprising…</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And… now!”</p><p class="double">Dash set the second fight of pegasi going.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The spectacular finale of the <i>1812 Overture</i> blasted holes in the sky over Canterlot and shattered every window in the city.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Twilight asked brightly, turning around to see every other pony in the building trying to hide under tables. “What did you think?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And that’s why I think Cadance has become evil.” Twilight finished, and cancelled the creation spell that had provided her slide projector.</p><p class="double">Nopony said anything for a moment. Then Celestia frowned. “Twilight, my dearest student… are you sure you’re not just jealous? I mean, your brother has apologized for not letting you know earlier-”</p><p class="double">“I can prove it!” Twilight overrode her. “Dispel magic!”</p><p class="double">The purple-tinged spell shot across the room, and hit a shocked Cadance.</p><p class="double">Who detransformed, becoming Queen Chrysalis.</p><p class="double">“Quod Erat Demonstrandum. Q.E.D.” Twilight said. “Thanks for your confidence, by the way, guys.”</p><p class="double">All the others looked thoroughly embarrassed.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked from the six Elements of Harmony, to the Princess of the Sun, to a rapidly recovering (and pissed) Shining Armor. “Er… I plead Queen’s Evidence?”</p><p class="double">“We don’t have that law.” Twilight said. “We do have laws against kidnapping, mind control, impersonation, all-up identity theft…” Twilight kept going for several minutes, “…and looking at you I think you’re even in trouble for entry into the country without a passport.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right!” Twilight said. “I’m sure this’ll work.”</p><p class="double">Element of Magic, check. Lump of Cosmic Spectrum stone, check. Alicorn Amulet, check. The Rainbow of Light, from that Loop with that nice Megan girl, check. Rainbow of Dark looted from Tirek in a different iteration of the same loop, check.</p><p class="double">Hanging both Rainbows – one pouch, one locket – around her neck and then the lump of crystal, she put on the Element of Magic, transformed, took up the Alicorn Amulet, and came back to awareness in a gigantic crater.</p><p class="double">In front of her were her friends – and Trixie, strangely – wearing five of the Elements of Harmony. A circlet with a wand on it graced Trixie’s forehead, and they were all panting heavily.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around, then up – and noticed that the sky was full of gradually shrinking stars, returning to their normal sizes.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh. Note to self, don’t push your luck.</i></p><p class="double">“…sorry.” She muttered, glancing down at her feet and seeing the ruins of most of the magical artefacts she’d been wearing. “I kind of overdid it, huh.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to Fluttershy. “Alright, ‘shy, I’ve got a job for you.”</p><p class="double">“Y-you have?” Fluttershy said. “Okay. I’ll give it a go.”</p><p class="double">Picking the Kindness necklace up from the floor, she handed it to Fluttershy. “Here. This has a spell attached to it which should keep you safe. Now, I’d like you to see if you can negotiate with Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">“Eep!” Fluttershy flinched. “I… why?”</p><p class="double">“I think you’ll do fine.” Twilight said firmly. “Remember, you’ve not let us down yet, in any Loop. And I’d like for the wedding to go smoothly for once.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy mulled it over, then her face set determinedly. “I’ll do it, Twilight.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So.” Chrysalis laughed. “A lone pony comes to us, speaking of peace and coexistence. Something we have not been shown in a thousand years or more from your Princess Celestia.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Fluttershy said. “Do they know about you?”</p><p class="double">“Clearly.” Chrysalis replied sarcastically. “How else did you find us?”</p><p class="double">“…actually, I was just seeing who built the building I saw from the air.” Fluttershy answered, truthfully. After all, it might have been Diamond Dogs.</p><p class="double">A few changelings looked quizzically at the yellow pegasus, feeling waves of universal affection rolling off her. She liked <i>all</i> of them.</p><p class="double">“Feh. Words.” Chrysalis, and made to turn away. A ripple ran around the assembled changelings, and she stopped mid-movement. “Oh? How strange. It seems the hive has some affection for you, little pegasus. I may keep you around… for their amusement.”</p><p class="double">“Alright.” Fluttershy said, agreeably. “If they feel that way, that’s fine.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I don’t understand it, Twilight.” Rarity said. “Fluttershy has gone missing. She wasn’t at the spa for our appointment yesterday. Do you know where she is?”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry, Rarity.” Twilight soothed. “Fluttershy is fine. She’s just making some new friends, that’s all. She might be a while, I’m afraid.”</p><p class="double">“Oh. She mentioned she was going, but I didn’t realize it would be for that long. Well, tell her to stop by the <i>second</i> she gets back.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and Rarity left the library.</p><p class="double">Dash looked up from her <i>Intricate Webber</i> book. “That’s totally not the whole story, is it?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Twilight replied easily. Ever since they’d shared a Loop as the Princesses, she’d felt closer than ever to the pegasus. Dash seemed to have the same comfortable familiarity with her, as well – a result of having been sisters-in-name for centuries. “Fluttershy <i>is</i> making friends. They’re just insectoid shapeshifters, if you get my meaning. And I sent her off with her Element, too.”</p><p class="double">“What – <i>oh</i>.” Dash grinned. “Be nice to have her in the club.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As ponies took their places in the seats before the wedding, a cry of surprise went up from one of the guard detail. Others followed his pointing hoof, and then started to see it as well.</p><p class="double">Shining Armor sighed, upset at the interruption and what it might mean. “Sorry, dear. I hope this is nothing.”</p><p class="double">“That’s alright,” his fiancée sighed. “I wish it hadn’t happened, but it’s not your fault.”</p><p class="double">She stole a peck on his cheek, and he gave a little silly grin before putting on his work face.</p><p class="double">By now, the approaching objects were close enough to be seen by everypony. There was a loose cloud of black-looking shapes flying through the air towards them, with two slightly larger ones leading them.</p><p class="double">Of the Element bearers not in on what was going on, Pinkie worked it out first. “Yay, Fluttershy’s back! And she brought friends!”</p><p class="double">Circling the field once, Fluttershy led Chrysalis and a hundred changelings in to land. The way her landing pushed up her hair made most of the watching ponies gasp – she had a small but still quite apparent <i>horn</i> on her forehead.</p><p class="double">Trotting up to Celestia and Luna with Chrysalis half a length behind, she bowed. “Princesses, may I present Queen Chrysalis of the Changelings, here to pay her respects to the happy couple.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity pushed Fluttershy bodily towards Carousel Boutique. “You <i>really</i> should get your mane done, darling, it needs to show off that horn <i>much</i> better. And I need to make a dress for you – one suitable for a coronation, no less! Come on, you <i>do</i> need these measurements.”</p><p class="double">“Um… okay…” Fluttershy said, skidding slightly on the floor. “I’d rather… no, never mind, if you think it’s important.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis watched with some confusion, and leant over to Twilight. “Is this normal?”</p><p class="double">“For Ponyville? Yes.” Twilight, Applejack and Dash chorused.</p><p class="double">Pinkie was currently suffering from a mild case of party overload, trying to work out which event to celebrate first. “…Ooh, I could do the diplomatic reception… but that didn’t go so well with the Buffalo. Maybe if I started small with the Fluttershy’s Back party, and went straight into the Fluttershy’s a Princess party…”</p><p class="double">“Out of curiosity, how do changelings react to sugar?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“It’s a useful nutrient, and we can eat a lot. It can substitute in for love for a little while – not that we’ve had any problems since Fluttershy showed up.” Chrysalis said. “She is just remarkably… <i>nice</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Pinkie’s going to like you.” Twilight said with conviction. “Ask her to show you her Genocide By Toffee.” Seeing the queen’s reaction, she tossed her head. “It’s not actually fatal… that is, if you stop in time. It should feed every changeling you brought, with some to spare.”</p><p class="double">“… that concept is actually strangely terrifying.” Chrysalis muttered, watching the bouncing pink pony. “And yet I find myself suddenly hungry.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.5 (Sonic)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>“In the world (her world!) where life is strong,</i></p><p class="double"><i>In the world (her world!) life’s an open book-”</i></p><p class="double">“Can you stop singing!” Twilight snapped. “I know you like having you own theme tune this time, but come <i>on!</i>”</p><p class="double">Dash shook her head unrepentantly. “I love this world! I thought you’d enjoy it too, Twilight!”</p><p class="double">“Being eight years old is putting a dampener on it.” Twilight adjusted the manifold to the piston engine on their biplane. “But yeah, I’m not surprised you enjoy a world where you have to run at four hundred miles an hour just to go shopping.”</p><p class="double">“They have <i>loop-the-loop roads</i>, Twilight!” Rainbow looked like she wanted to introduce them to Equestria. “The only downside is that Dr. Robuttnik. And I like kicking robots in half, too, so that’s not all bad.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.6 (Evangelion)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight staggered against the wall of a railway car as she Awoke into what seemed a fairly high tech loop. “Oof! Ah, great, I’m human…”</p><p class="double">“Hi. You sound new to this Loop,” a voice said. She turned, memories of the Loop settling into place, and saw-</p><p class="double">“What <i>is</i> it with me and being the sister of human Anchors?”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Shinji Ikari said. “So you’re… Twilight Rokobungi, right? My half sister, this Loop?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Yeah. Equestria is my home Loop.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, you’ll be familiar with this kind of thing, then.” At her perplexed expression, Shinji elaborated. “We have giant robot fights here too.”</p><p class="double">For a moment, the normally-a-unicorn wasn’t really able to make a sound. “Pardon? You think we have giant robot fights?”</p><p class="double">“Well… yeah. I was in one of your loops. I mean, I stayed out of the way, but I was there alright. There was some giant robot… the megalicorn or something?”</p><p class="double">Twilight slapped her forehead with her palm, staggering slightly as she got the hang of bipedalism again. “That wasn’t our prime loop. Nothing close.”</p><p class="double">“It <i>did</i> seem a little too ‘Power Rangers’.” Shinji agreed. “Right, come on. Time to get out of the danger zone of Lord Derpface the Easily Defeated.”</p><p class="double">He pulled on Twilight’s arm, and she followed him at a staggering run out of the way of a flying machine crash.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I don’t get it.” Twilight said, frowning.</p><p class="double">“You are not required to understand.” Gendo said, staring down at his daughter. “You are only required to obey.”</p><p class="double">“No, what I mean is, <i>why</i> did the giant monster thing attack here? I mean, it is statistically incredibly unlikely that a giant monster with no understanding of language or humanity would come down one of the few places with <i>one</i> convenient giant robot, let alone with <i>three</i>.”</p><p class="double">Shinji stood back, interested.</p><p class="double">“We will discuss this later. If the Fourth Child will not obey orders, then the First Child will be used instead.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head hastily. “No, I’m not… okay, look. I’m questioning your methods and motives, not the necessity of stopping that thing from stamping up and down on the city until it breaks. Excuse me… is it Doctor Akagi?”</p><p class="double">The scientist nodded.</p><p class="double">“Would I be able to look at the literature concerning those monster things? I might have a few ideas.” With that, Twilight started walking briskly towards the gantry to Unit 03.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight didn’t listen to the briefing much. In fact, she wasn’t really able to <i>hear</i> much. Her talent with magic apparently extended to this artificial machine’s ‘AT Field’, and she was able to sense <i>everything</i> within a mile of her Unit’s location.</p><p class="double"><i>But ick. This is </i>not<i> a robot. Just ewww…</i></p><p class="double">She finally noticed Sachiel, and grabbed it in a telekinesis-style AT grip before holding it fifty feet off the floor. “What should I do with this?”</p><p class="double">Shinji was laughing himself sick in Unit-01, and everyone else was shouting about sync ratios.</p><p class="double">“Um… don’t know?” Misato eventually said.</p><p class="double">“Just throw it into the sun!” Shinji gasped out through his paroxysms of laughter.</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a mental shrug, and threw Sachiel as high as she could. While she didn’t think it would make the sun, it <i>did</i> seem to hit escape velocity.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Only units 01 and 02 will be deployed on this mission.” Misato said, pointing at Israfael.</p><p class="double">“Why?” Shinji asked. “Twilight’s doing fine, throwing Angels at the moon.”</p><p class="double">Asuka looked torn between being impressed and being upset. She’d been rather startled when Twilight made her Unit throw Gahgiel into space, but at least it was another girl showing her up.</p><p class="double">“We’re kinda getting complaints from the JSSDF that we’re showing them up.” Misato said, stifling a grin. “But orders are orders.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight shrugged. “I’ll go chase up that classified information. Ritsuko owes me a favour anyway…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rei brought out the Lance of Longinus.</p><p class="double">“Wait.” Twilight said, incredulous. “We have an <i>anti angel melee weapon</i> and you’ve not used it? Right, that’s it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight opened fully to Unit 03, wrapped an AT field around it, and materialized in low earth orbit. She grabbed Arael and threw it at the moon, then caught the Lance as it went past. “Okay, I’m keeping this.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lilith rose from the earth, and began Instrumentality.</p><p class="double">“Does this happen <i>every</i> time?” Twilight asked. </p><p class="double">Shinji nodded wearily. “It’s scary the first time, trippy the second time, and after that it gets kind of boring.”</p><p class="double">“Your Loop is weird. And I say that in full knowledge of how strange all the other Anchors would find a world inhabited mainly by ponies.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.7 (from Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Tia, wake up!&quot; The piercing voice of her sister Luna woke Princes Celestia in her room at Canterlot Castle. </p><p class="double">Had Celestia been in a clearer mind she would have given thanks that Luna didn&#039;t use the Canterlot Royal Speaking Voice, it was especially annoying to wake up to that. &quot;Nnnrrgh, give me five minutes Luna. The Sun isn&#039;t even out yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">A not-so delicate eyebrow rose on the Moon Princess&#039; face &quot;You <i>raise</i> the Sun, Tia. Of course ‘tis still night.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right Lulu, you win.&quot; And, yawning extravagantly, Princess Celestia raised herself from her bed. &quot;Was there something important today?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ll need to check preparations for the celebration for the Elements of Harmony bearers after defeating Discord... again&quot; Luna answered with an annoyed-sounding voice; but Celestia knew better.</p><p class="double">Both Luna and Celestia, due to being alicorns, had great magic power and amplified traits from earth ponies, pegasi and unicorns. More importantly, they were also well aware they were very long-lived in comparison to the other pony races, having seen their subjects live and die many times before. And while she had lived a long time, this relatively new &quot;time loop&quot; incident around Twilight Sparkle was most unusual.</p><p class="double">Celestia then went to a nearby mirror to start brushing her mane, noting the amused look in her sister&#039;s face. The movement of the brush was calming, not at all like it was the first time she looped. She was so worried all her recent work was for nothing… </p><p class="double">It had actually been Twilight Sparkle who informed her about the time loops. And while she was initially worried Equestria was in danger from some unknown force and worried as much again for the Element bearers as the Royal Pony Sisters weren&#039;t Awake often enough to protect them, she soon realized the loops were a blessing in disguise.</p><p class="double">While Celestia may admit that was a selfish thought, the long years of her sister&#039;s banishment made her realize that effective immortality is only good if you can enjoy it with other, hopefully also long-lived, ponies. After her faithful student claimed the Element of Magic that fateful day, Celestia could enjoy it with Luna again, and now they could also share their long life with Twilight Sparkle and the other Element holders due to the time loops. However, should they get separated from one another, Celestia also asked them to write Friendship reports about those other worlds Twilight sometimes went into… those &quot;pseudo-loops&quot;. It wasn’t much, perhaps, but for Twilight to remember she would meet her friends and mentor again was all the help Celestia could give… and she was a bit curious on what those other worlds were like, after the loop in that Konoha place.</p><p class="double">After finishing brushing her mane Celestia walked towards her sister, thinking how glad she was that the loops always started the day before the thousandth Summer Sun celebration – instead of, say, just after Nightmare Moon was imprisoned. <i>&#039;Thank Harmony for small miracles&#039;</i>.</p><p class="double">Finally Celestia stood in front of her sister, looking directly at her. &quot;Luna, can you do a little favour for me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What would it be, Tia?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s level look lasted until her sister nuzzled her and said &quot;The next loop we both are awake... would you be my sister again? No matter who we are?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna just smiled, and nuzzled her back. &quot;Always.&quot;</p><p class="double">It was a good day to be alive. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.8 (Any human self insert. Preference is “Hands” by AJT, I think.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I honestly have no idea how to solve this.” Twilight said, looking at the unconscious human lying on Fluttershy’s lawn. “I didn’t know this could happen.”</p><p class="double">“Ooh! Ooh! I know!” Pinkie said. “You could make a conver-mmmph!”</p><p class="double">Twilight’s hoof had gone into Pinkie’s mouth without her looking. “Let me make one thing clear, Pinkie. <i>We Do Not Talk About The Bureau!”</i></p><p class="double">“Mmkay.” Pinkie mumbled.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Twilight pulled her hoof out again. “Right. Now, there’s a few options. We could put an illusion on him and pretend he’s a Diamond Dog.”</p><p class="double">“That… could work…” Fluttershy mumbled.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Only problem is getting him to go along with it. Second option is that we keep him out of sight.”</p><p class="double">“Booooring.” Pinkie said flatly.</p><p class="double">“Or we just let things happen and see how it goes.” Twilight finished.</p><p class="double">“Well-” Fluttershy stopped. “Do you hear… something?”</p><p class="double">“…omigosh omigosh omigosh <i>omigosh</i> I WAS RIGHT!” Lyra dopplered over the closest hill and skidded to a halt, throwing up big rooster-tails of dirt. “<i>You guys found a</i> <i>human!</i>”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight said, calmly. “Option three it is, then. Pinkie, go let Celestia know to ignore any reports of mass panic out of Ponyville in the near future.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.9</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Spike said, as they Awoke. “What the hell-”</p><p class="double">“Sssh!” Twilight said, then dropped a privacy spell around them. “Calm down, Spike.”</p><p class="double">“What the hell happened!” Spike said, unrepentant. “Last I remember, I was thirty feet long, couldn’t talk, and you were a human!”</p><p class="double">It took Twilight a moment to remember. “Wow, your luck isn’t great. That was when we met Hiccup, which was <i>ages</i> ago for me.” Loop memories settled. “And it’s Twi-gon Jinn, here. And you’re Spiky-one Kenobi.”</p><p class="double">“Those are stupid names.” Spike muttered.</p><p class="double">“Stupid or not, they’re what we’ve got to work with. Now, do you remember what we’re supposed to be doing?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I – yeah! That’s really bizarre!” Spike took the lightsaber from his hip and looked at it. “Cool, I can swordfight now.”</p><p class="double">“Focus.” Twilight reminded him. “We’ll need to be – oof!”</p><p class="double">A pulse of darkness rolled across the Force, as their ship was destroyed.</p><p class="double">Twilight enclosed herself in a bubble of air as poison gas flowed into the room. Spike didn’t catch what was going on, and took a sniff.</p><p class="double">“Hmm. Quite tangy.”</p><p class="double">After a moment staring, the Jedi Master rolled her eyes. Of <i>course</i> Spike could breathe poison gas. He could eat Baked Bads, this was nothing.</p><p class="double">The door hissed open, admitting battle droids. Twilight sent them flying down the corridor with a telekinetic shove. “Come on, Spike, let’s go register our disapproval with the accommodations.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright, that is <i>it</i>.” Twilight said, as Destroyer Droids rolled up. “Come on, Spike!”</p><p class="double">With a flash, she teleported them both to the Naboo surface.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack struggled woozily awake. “What th’hell happened to me?”</p><p class="double">“Please be calm, you are still recovering.” A voice said gently. Applejack’s vision cleared enough to see it belonged to a human-like figure wearing bandages and goggle-lenses. “We found you near the wreckage of a crashed ship. There were no other survivors. Do you remember what happened?”</p><p class="double">She scanned her Loop memories, getting a basic sense of how this Loop operated, and winced. Apparently she’d been captured as a slave by pirates or something…well, at least she’d escaped, if that was how you wanted to put it.</p><p class="double">“Here.” The figure reached behind itself. “There is something we found in the wreckage – it was the only other thing of value, instead of basic supplies and metal. You should probably have it.”</p><p class="double">Applejack’s eyes lit up. <i>Well, I’ll be darned. That’s the Element of Honesty. Ah guess it followed me here.</i></p><p class="double">“Thanks,” she said, slipping the Element around her neck for safe-keeping. “How kin ah repay you?”</p><p class="double">“I will admit that we do not have much in the way of surplus. Perhaps you could help us gather food and water?”</p><p class="double">“All right.” Applejack nodded. “Soon as you say ah’m ready, ah’ll do it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, how’s Rarity doing?” Spike asked, slicing a battle droid in half.</p><p class="double">Twi-gonn spun her saber telekinetically and deflected blaster bolts with a shield, then coupled it with a lightning spell. “Fairly well. She’s using the Loops to try to find the perfect dress for every possible occasion.”</p><p class="double">“Neat.” Spike finished off the last droid. “Right, everyone on the ship! You as well… Queen, right?”</p><p class="double">“That is correct, my young padawan learner.” Twi-gonn said.</p><p class="double">“Twi, that sounds like I use a paddle to hit things.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, let’s see…” Applejack focused. There was that one loop she’d been blind, which had taught her a lot about earth chi, and then there was earth <i>magic</i>…</p><p class="double">Breathing deeply, she took a stance and pushed. <i>Channel the energy. Don’t try to provide it yourself, just act as a channel.</i></p><p class="double">The Sand People watched, astonished, as an apple tree sprouted from the bare sand. It got to about four feet high before Applejack staggered.</p><p class="double">“Ergh… sorry, I don’t exactly have this all down yet. Ah’ll give it another go tomorrow.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“No!” Spike shouted, as Darth Maul thrust his lightsaber into Twilight’s body.</p><p class="double">Then Twilight flashed purple, and exploded with magic that bounced Darth Maul off two walls and into a giant pit. When the flash blindness had worn off and Spike could see again, he saw Twilight with wings and a tiara.</p><p class="double">His jaw dropped. “…wait, you can DO that now?”</p><p class="double">“Whenever I want, pretty much.” Twilight confirmed, then detransformed after checking her injury was healed. “Come on, let’s get back to wherever the Queen is.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, how’d you swing <i>this</i> with Yoda?” Knight Spike asked, looking across at Padawan Skywalker. “I mean, if we’re still a team?”</p><p class="double">“We are.” Twilight confirmed. “I said that young Anakin would need both of us as guidance rather than just one master, because he’s older than normal.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight fretted as she paced on the starship. Having Spike go off on his own to investigate Kamino was worrying enough to her – never mind that he was an adult himself now, he was barely even a stripling by Looper standards – and now Anakin had managed to get them onto a trip to look at his mother’s condition.</p><p class="double">Admittedly, though, from what Hiccup had told her, she was lucky Anakin wasn’t Awake…</p><p class="double">“Coming out of hyperspace.” Anakin said. “…huh. I think we got the wrong star system. That <i>can’t</i> be Tatooine.”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Twilight asked, peering out the window.</p><p class="double">“Well, look at it!” Anakin pointed. “It’s… <i>green</i>. And that’s an ocean!”</p><p class="double">The Jedi Master levitated up a holonet comm. “No, this is the right system. Right planet, as well. And… oh, okay. You know how there’s a million planets in the galaxy?”</p><p class="double">Anakin and Padme nodded.</p><p class="double">“Turns out that even interesting news doesn’t show up if it happens in the outer rim. There’s just too much to keep track of. This has been going on for years.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The H-type yacht landed in Mos Espa, now a city with verdant plant life everywhere the eye could see, and a party came up to greet them.</p><p class="double">Twilight gaped, almost stumbling down the ramp. “<i>Applejack?”</i></p><p class="double">“Howdy!” Applejack said, grinning broadly. “Ah <i>thought</i> y’all had to be somewhere. And you’re a Jedi, eh? Can’t say ah’m surprised.”</p><p class="double">“But… but…” Twilight gibbered, pointing between Applejack’s wings and horn. “How?”</p><p class="double">“Beats me.” Applejack shrugged. “Happened about when ah’d managed to green the whole Jundland Wastes, and it made the rest of the job all much easier ah kin tell you.”</p><p class="double">“…right.” Twilight started to recover. “Of course. Massive achievement involving trees, and earth magic and stuff. And if you have the Element of Honesty here, that’d catalyze it properly. Well, welcome to the alicorn club.”</p><p class="double">“Am I missing something, master?” Anakin asked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike looked up defiantly at Count Dooku. “Twilight will take your entire separatist movement apart!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I don’t think so, young Jedi Knight.” The tall Sith stalked around Spike’s force cage. “We are quite ready for one Jedi Master.”</p><p class="double">There was a sudden rumbling BOOM, and the top half of the Geonosian hive went flying, exposing them to the air. Two alicorns flew in, the purple one spinning two lightsabers by telekinesis and the orange one slamming her hooves into the floor to cause huge waves of earth and rock.</p><p class="double">“…oh, you meant literally.” Dooku said, in the tones of someone hoping he had spare trousers somewhere. “In that case, Chancellor Palpatine is Darth Sidious, please don’t kill me!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was evil.” Spike said, nodding in approval.</p><p class="double">“I’m quite proud of it.” Twilight agreed. She’d taken Darth Sidious and Darth Tyrannus, slapped Sombra-grade power limiters on them and dumped them on the surface of the forest moon of Endor. Let them try learning Ewokese…</p><p class="double">“Oh, why did you get the Jedi Council to change the rules on marriage? And, er, <i>how?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Basically…” Twilight tailed off. “<i>Why</i> is because Anakin and Padme are clearly in love. <i>How</i> is that I gathered up a list of all the Jedi who have had children. It includes a fair number of the founders of the order – like Nomi Sunrider and the whole Sunrider family – and one of the sitting members of the council, Ki-Adi-Mundi. But to really make my point, I printed it out. I used up the paper in that printer.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Spike muttered. “So it just doesn’t work.”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Twilight said, then shrugged. “Besides, Cadance would try to strangle me if she heard I’d gone along with a Loop where love was <i>banned.</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">4.10 (from Vulpine Fury) (first time in Gen 1)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sighed as she looked at herself in the mirror. The new coat colour was going to take some getting used to, almost as much as looking exactly like her mother in one of the &#039;normal&#039; loops.</p><p class="double">But then, this loop, it seemed, every first-born mare looked like her mother.</p><p class="double">&quot;Baby Twilight!&quot; a grandfatherly voice called from behind her. &quot;What brings you to the old Moochik?&quot;</p><p class="double">She seethed slightly at the &quot;Baby.&quot; She was at least as old as the Cutie Mark Crusaders in a normal Timeline, for Celestia&#039;s sake! She took a deep breath like <i>her</i> Cadance had shown her and hoofed away the annoyance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mister Moochik? Can you teach me?&quot; He might not be Celestia, or even Cheerilee, but he was definitely at least as good as Professor Bastion Yorsets from Celestia&#039;s Academy. Far be it from her to pass up a magical education of any sort. Who knew? She might be able to apply some of the lessons when the Loops were over. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight said, looking from the book titled <i>Enemies of Ponyland</i> to the enormous chariot-riding Centaur, Tirek. “This Loop might be a lot more fun than I was expecting…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<br /><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">5.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, Spike.” Twilight said. “Since this is your first time looping in a home loop, you get to pick where to diverge from the original timeline.”</p><p class="double">Spike pondered. “Hmmm… I kind of want to do something awesome… I know! Can you make a lightsaber?”</p><p class="double">“No need.” Twilight’s horn flickered, and one levitated out of her mane. “One of the things Hiccup told me all Loopers eventually get working is a pocket dimension trick. He showed me how some time ago, and I shoved our lightsabers in there last time since I didn’t have any yet.”</p><p class="double">Spike reached out his hand, concentrating, and his face lit up as the lightsaber left Twilight’s grip and floated gently over to him. “This is so cool!”</p><p class="double">He coughed, suddenly feeling embarrassed. “Right. Okay, are any of the others awake?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Twilight shook her head. “I checked. I’m guessing one of the next few loops I’m going to be having a run as one of the Royal Sisters, with AJ as the other one – that always seems to happen when somepony first ascends. But no-one is this loop.”</p><p class="double">“Good.” Spike rummaged in the closet, found a belt, and threaded the lightsaber’s detachable clip through it. “I’ll let you know when I think of a good time.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity vanished underground as the Diamond Dogs pulled her down.</p><p class="double"><i>Right, now would seem to be a good time,</i> Spike decided. He pulled his ‘saber from the belt Rarity had made for him last month, for what he’d said was a torch, and took a two handed grip. Igniting it, he set his stance and faced Rover. “I won’t let you ponynap Rarity.”</p><p class="double">Rover laughed. “You too little.”</p><p class="double"><i>Shii-cho. Sun Djem.</i></p><p class="double">Spike <i>moved</i>, and when he stopped Rover had had a drastic manicure – his claws down to stubs.</p><p class="double">“I dunno. I think I’m doing alright,” he said lightheartedly.</p><p class="double">“Uh…” Rover examined his lost claws. “How you do that?”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged. “Now, you <i>will</i> tell me where your pack took Rarity.” He waved his off hand.</p><p class="double">Diamond Dogs were just about the textbook description of a weak mind.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Really?” Twilight said, giving Spike a sardonic look after Rarity left. She’d spent almost twenty minutes gushing about how brave and dashing Spike had been in rescuing her. “You went with that?”</p><p class="double">Spike grinned. “Hey, you <i>did</i> say I got to pick.”</p><p class="double">Then his face clouded. “Oh, great. Do I have to go on the dragon migration every single time to pick up Peewee?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Twilight replied, happily. “<i>That</i> problem I solved some time ago. I can pick up the right egg for you about the time of the Gala.”</p><p class="double">“Good.” Spike breathed out, relieved. “Glad that isn’t a problem.”</p><p class="double">“Though, speaking of that…” Twilight added, “I <i>do</i> know roughly how to swing it so that Rarity asks you to go to the Gala with her. Only problems are, you have to spend over a year working on being as mature as possible and it’ll be the one the year after next.”</p><p class="double">Spike considered that. “Yeah, sounds worth it. Okay, how do I start?”</p><p class="double">Twilight slammed a giant tome down in front of him. “Memorize this.”</p><p class="double">“…did you ever manage to convince the non-looping me to do this?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Twilight said. “Once or twice.”</p><p class="double">“And how many times did you try?” he pressed.</p><p class="double">“I lost count.” The unicorn shrugged. “A lot.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">5.2 (Pokémon)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You know, Fluttershy,” Twilight said, sitting down on the side of Kanto Route 14. “I can’t help but think you have an advantage here.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy tickled a Shinx under the chin. “You’re a good girl, aren’t you? Sorry, what was that, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Never mind. But all I’ve caught so far is a Hoothoot, and that was when you were asleep. The Pokémon all head for you so fast I can never catch them.”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Fluttershy said, “At least you have your starter.”</p><p class="double">The Charmeleon that was Spike this Loop looked resigned. “Char.”</p><p class="double">Twilight made a face. “I can’t actually <i>train</i> Spike very well because of the same problem! We’re having to rely entirely on battles with trainers, and that doesn’t usually go very well.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, look, Twilight!” Fluttershy said, pointing at the Pokémon Blake had just sent out. “It’s you when you’re annoyed!”</p><p class="double">Twilight’s eye twitched as she looked between the Rapidash and her Pokédex screen. “That’s just not fair.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Wow.” Twilight said. “It looks like you really <i>did</i> manage to catch them all.” Then, because she was still a pedant, added “well, not so much catch, as recruit.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy beamed.</p><p class="double">Twilight then gave a sour look at the Rapidash in the paddock, who had been joined by Ponyta, Cobalion, Virizion, Terrakion and Keldeo. “Though I can’t help but think someone’s playing a trick on us…”</p><p class="double">Still, that they’d finished was nice. No more overenthusiastic kids throwing Poké balls at them…</p><p class="double">“Ah, there you are!” Professor Oak said, causing a feeling of dread in Twilight’s stomach. “I just got permission for the two of you to go explore the Kalos region!”</p><p class="double">Spike – still one of Twilight’s only three Pokémon, to go with her Noctowl and a rather incongruous Moltres – gave a resigned growl.</p><p class="double"><u>Here we go again,</u> her Pokédex translated helpfully.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">5.3: Diplomancy (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">This loop round it appeared that only Twilight herself had looped, the others had defaulted to their pre-loop memories. It had meant following the original path of events pretty much, though since she&#039;d already known the answers, she managed to make her friendship connections during the day she arrived.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d taken her new friends into her confidence shortly after they arrived at Pinkie Pie&#039;s welcome party, rather than wasting the whole night worrying and complaining. Pinkie found the Reference Guide, and as she&#039;d hoped, they&#039;d insisted on going with her to collect the Elements.</p><p class="double">While things had been easier without Nightmare Moon attacking them, they&#039;d still had challenges, and her friends&#039; characters had shone through. The upshot had been, even without the others having their loop memories, when Nightmare Moon had finally appeared, they were all ready to give her a face-full of rainbow.</p><p class="double">Still that didn&#039;t solve the current problem, Trixie had appeared right on schedule. However, Twilight had decided to try a different approach. For once, she&#039;d try diplomacy. Her friends had reacted in their usual fashion, complaining about Trixie&#039;s boasting, but when Dash started to boo, Twilight cast a one way silence charm around her head and turned to face them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Guys I&#039;m surprised at you! What&#039;s with all the hate? Her talent is stage magic, showy magic! Her boasting is all just part of the act! Rarity, when you create clothing, you show it off to its best advantage? Rainbow, I&#039;d have thought you of all ponies would appreciate a good performance!</p><p class="double">And Applejack, I know you don&#039;t boast about your skills, but you enjoy showing them off, don&#039;t you? How would you like it if someone started booing you in the middle of a rodeo? Let&#039;s just enjoy the show.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stern look that accompanied her comment chastened the three ponies, and they quietened down. However, Spike loudly exclaimed, &quot;But you&#039;ve got more magic in the tip of your horn than she has in her whole body!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced as Trixie&#039;s voice carried over the crowd. &quot;Well, well, well, it seems we have a neighsayer in the audience! Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they&#039;re in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria? You, with your back turned!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and turned to face her. &quot;That was my companion, Spike. I&#039;m sorry if we interrupted your show, I was quite enjoying it. Your grasp of manifestation magic and illusions is quite good, and your practical application is first rate!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie preened. &quot;Ha! So you admit no-pony has more magical power than the Great and Powerful Trixie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Her fanfare and fireworks went off again. Spike started to protest, but Twilight cast a zipping spell on his mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;For only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded Ursa Major!&quot; She spun her usual tale of heroism, and suitably awed the surrounding ponies. Snips and Snails started their fan-colting rant and Twilight winced.</p><p class="double">She made a mental note to watch Snips and Snails like a hawk. If she could head them off, she could prevent both the Ursa Minor attack and Trixie&#039;s humiliation, which should prevent the business with the Alicorn Amulet as well. Not that that was a problem in itself, alicorn Twilight could spank amulet enhanced Trixie both in magic, and physically, as she&#039;d once proven with Trixie&#039;s own whip when the mare was being particularly aggravating.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s true, my enthusiastic little admirers. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville. Don&#039;t believe the Great and Powerful Trixie?&quot; The unicorn showmare chuckled. &quot;Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians - anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike finally unzipped himself and complained. &quot;Please, she&#039;s unbearable! Ya gotta show her, you just gotta!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t need to prove anything! Besides, it&#039;ll only cause problems later…&quot; Twilight was interrupted by Trixie again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm… How about you?&quot; Twilight wrestled with her conscience as the mare hectored her. She wasn&#039;t worried about showing off her power, she knew her friends would understand, she just didn&#039;t want to get in a horn waving contest with the blue unicorn. &quot;Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can&#039;t? Well, little hayseed?&quot;</p><p class="double">She saw Applejack start forward out of the corner of her eye, and that decided her. She&#039;d done her best to avoid aggravating Trixie, but events still seemed to be playing out the way they had originally, and she was not going to let her friends get humiliated to save Trixie&#039;s feelings.</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and she teleported on stage alongside Trixie. &quot;It&#039;s one thing to challenge your audience to a contest, another to show contempt for them! Ponyville may not be a city the size of Canterlot or Manehattan, but they are good ponies, not &#039;hayseeds&#039;!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie took a few steps back. &quot;What? How did… I mean, a simple trick, and I can accomplish easily!&quot;</p><p class="double">She stepped up to the curtain at the back of her stage, and disappeared in a cloud of smoke, then reappeared in another on the opposite side of the stage. Twilight didn&#039;t mention she noticed the tops of the curtains twitch as something moved through them each time. You probably wouldn&#039;t notice it if you weren&#039;t up there on the stage with her. The unicorn had also recovered some of her aplomb.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re a brave mare to challenge the Great and Powerful Trixie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;I didn&#039;t come up here to challenge you, just to ask that you show a little respect to other ponies. I don&#039;t need to prove anything, and neither do you.&quot;</p><p class="double">She remembered Dash&#039;s speech to Lightning Dust and hoped it might work better on Trixie. &quot;I get that you&#039;re all about doing impressive magic, really, I&#039;m a student of magic myself so I understand how much fun it is to demonstrate a new spell. But you don&#039;t need to make other ponies look small to make yourself look big.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmph! Who are you to tell the Great and Powerful Trixie what she can and can&#039;t do? Well, come on, show Trixie what you&#039;ve got. Show us all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Told you, not interested. I&#039;m just your regular run of the mill Ponyville citizen. Nothing to see here, move along...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight turned away, casting two hastened spells against Trixie&#039;s likely reaction. The first was a modified medical imaging spell she&#039;d learned during a loop where she&#039;d been a nurse at Ponyville General Hospital. The glow of her horn faded and winked out as the characteristic frequency shifted up into the X-ray region and flared off the tip. The second was a custom contingent pocket dimension spell she&#039;d figured out. Unlike shield spells, it was invisible and undetectable until you triggered it.</p><p class="double">There was a crackle of lightning and a yelp from Trixie as the approach of the lightning spark from the cloud the stage unicorn had manifested tripped the spell. It formed a Klein bottle pocket dimension with a surface incident to an incoming attack. The upshot was, anything aimed at her would end up reversing direction while still going in a straight line.</p><p class="double">She suppressed a small smirk as she stepped down into the crowd, who didn&#039;t look to be particularly pleased with the blue unicorn. However, Applejack had already jumped upon the stage.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s it. I can&#039;t stand for no more of this! Twilight was defending you earlier, you stuck up mare, and then you attack her, from behind even! You&#039;re just plain mean!&quot; The farm pony glared at the smug unicorn and said, &quot;You want a challenge? You got one! Can your fancy magic powers do this?&quot;</p><p class="double">She hauled out her rope and did her party piece to oohs and ahhs from the crowd. &quot;Ha! Top that you two bit trickster!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh ye of little talent,&quot; Trixie&#039;s hat floated off her head, revealing her glowing horn. &quot;Now watch and be amazed at the magical power of Trixie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cast another spell, threading a tendril of her own magic into the telekinetic grip Trixie had of Applejack&#039;s discarded rope, carefully avoiding disturbing Trixie&#039;s weave. Of course, with the X Ray spell still going, there was no visible sign of her spell-casting, something that would have been impossible to hide with any ordinary illusion effect.</p><p class="double">She let it grab an apple, but when it went to hog-tie Applejack, she tweaked it so it overshot, and wrapped around Trixie&#039;s legs. Before the unicorn could cancel her grip, she found herself hog-tied, with an apple in her mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I gotta say, that is pretty amazin&#039;!&quot;Applejack chuckled as the rest of the audience burst into laughter. Trixie untangled herself and jumped to her hooves, glaring furious over at Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;You! You must have sabotaged the Great and Powerful Trixie&#039;s spell somehow!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight yawned. &quot;Was my horn glowing? Did anyone see my horn glowing? How could I affect your spell without casting one of my own? Not to mention that kind of fine control without you noticing it would require an incredible level of skill. Maybe your conscience just got the better of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was laughing loudly. &quot;He he he! Hey Trixie! Just as well you got yourself an apple for the teacher, &#039;cause you just got schooled!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes, you technicolor trollop?&quot; Trixie sneered. &quot;Maybe you think _you_ can show me something worth my time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, I know so!&quot; Dash took off, and pulled off her Rainbow Road stunt. At the end, surrounded by a sparkling rainbow corona, she posed and stated, &quot;They don&#039;t call me Rainbow, and Dash, for nothing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When Trixie is through, the only thing they&#039;ll call you is loser.&quot; As the stage unicorn grabbed hold of Dash&#039;s rainbow, Twilight countered by pushing a thread of magic through her connection to the elements and into Dash via hers, temporarily giving Dash access to her alicorn form&#039;s level of toughness and speed.</p><p class="double">This time, as Dash was spun and hauled up into the air, she blasted free at the peak of her loop, coming out of the spin in seconds. Unused to her new level of power, she slammed instantly through the Rainboom barrier and created a rainbow coloured shockwave that spread out over Ponyville.</p><p class="double">Dash slammed back down onto the stage like a thunderbolt, grinning madly and punching the air with a hoof. &quot;A Sonic Rainboom! Yeah! That was a rush! I never figured I could use a tornado rather than a power dive to give me the boost I needed!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But that wasn&#039;t...&quot; Trixie was still stunned. &quot;You were...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awesome, as usual!&quot; Dash grinned, &quot;But I couldn&#039;t have done that without your spell. Maybe you aren&#039;t so bad after all. Tell you what, call it a draw.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she flew off stage, Twilight threw another pocket reflector around the cyan pegasus, but this time, Trixie was still so flabbergasted she didn&#039;t follow up with another thunderbolt. As Dash landed, Twilight said, &quot;I&#039;m proud of you Dash, the way you handled that. You showed you were the bigger pony, not rubbing her face in it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The cyan mare rubbed the back of her head, looking slightly bashful. &quot;Aww, after all, she did help me pull off an awesome stunt! Besides I figured if you were trying to avoid a scene, I should help. The truth is, I felt like you were there with me, all the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight felt along their connection, and was surprised to find that her tampering had permanently pushed Dash into a slightly more mature state. It was likely she&#039;d be able to trigger a Sonic Rainboom reliably from now on, and might have fewer other problems.</p><p class="double">Trixie showed her spells included eavesdropping, as she declaimed, &quot;Aha! You were interfering again!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, &quot;Not this again! All that power, all that speed, that was all Dash.&quot; The literal truth. &quot;But you&#039;re right, I was up there with her all the way. But the only magic I supplied was the magic of friendship.&quot; Also true. &quot;You should try it some time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Grr! That&#039;s it! I demand you come up here and face me yourself!&quot; Trixie exclaimed. &quot;You talk a lot, but I don&#039;t see you putting your magic where your mouth is!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That would involve me sticking my horn in my mouth. Unhygenic, not to mention physiologically impossible.&quot; Twilight mused. &quot;Look, everyone&#039;s had a good time, you did show some pretty fine telekinetic control on that rope trick, not to mention grabbing that rainbow, something few unicorns could do. I&#039;m sure Applejack will call her challenge a draw too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you ain&#039;t bothered by that sneak attack she pulled sugar-cube, I&#039;ll be happy to.&quot; Applejack responded.</p><p class="double">&quot;You see? Call it quits, and everyone goes home happy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stop being so... so... reasonable!&quot; Trixie ranted. &quot;I want a proper challenge, and that means you!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike called out. &quot;It&#039;s about time! Go on Twilight, show her what a real unicorn can do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike, I really don&#039;t want to do this.&quot; Twilight said, but he wasn&#039;t the only one. A lot of the crowd were with him. She cancelled her X-Ray conversion spell, and stepped forward.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well, if this is the only way we can resolve this, I guess I have to. Guys, I hope you won&#039;t think I&#039;m showing off, but she seems immune to reason, so it may be the only way to get through to her is to beat her at her own game.&quot;</p><p class="double">She stepped up on the stage. &quot;Okay, shall we get on with it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie sneered again. &quot;First, I want to know who I have the pleasure of beating today.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The name&#039;s Twilight Sparkle, I run the local branch library and study magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha! A bookworm egghead! There is no way you can match the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you say so.&quot; Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Watch in awe, as I draw on my vast magical power...&quot; Her horn glowed fiercely, and the stage started to creak. She started to sweat, and the whole wagon lifted up into the air several hoof lengths to the oohs and ahhs of the crowd. &quot;... do you give up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded approvingly. &quot;That is pretty impressive. Very few unicorns can levitate this much mass.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her own horn glowed and the entire platform shot up another dozen feet. Then it started to rotate until it was inverted, with the two of them standing on the underside. &quot;I just happen to be one of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie was so surprised, her horn&#039;s glow faltered, but the platform stayed steady as a rock. She gasped and looked down in fear when she realised what she&#039;d done, but she was still stood on the stage as normal, even if the sky was underneath her and the ground overhead. &quot;How...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Reverse gravity spell. Never know when you might need it.&quot; Trixie looked ill, and Twilight took pity on her, returning the wagon to the ground, the right way up.</p><p class="double">Trixie recovered herself. &quot;So, you have some small skills after all, but can you do this?&quot;</p><p class="double">A bunch of flowers appeared hovering in front of her, and streamers of flags burst forth from within them, swirling around Trixie in colourful, ever-changing patterns.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nice manifestation. It&#039;s so real I can even smell the scent!&quot; Twilight said approvingly. &quot;How about adding these.&quot;</p><p class="double">Butterflies started appearing among the streamers, giant monarchs, tiger moths, fritiliaries, all weaving in and out, wings iridescent in the sunlight. They perched on Trixie&#039;s flowers, almost covering them. She&#039;d considered summoning parasprites, but had decided that would be too mean spirited. The trick was to beat Trixie without embarrassing her too badly. &quot;Manifestations, not simply summoned.&quot;</p><p class="double">The distinction might be lost on the audience, but Trixie should know manifesting animate creatures was harder than for plants or non-living flags. Trixie&#039;s items vanished, and she cried out, &quot;Very well then! Try to match these!&quot;</p><p class="double">A spectacular fireworks display appeared overhead, flashing and sparkling.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, Evocation next?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;Fire, and we&#039;ve already seen you do lightning. How about water then?&quot;</p><p class="double">Hogwarts had been fascinating, and broadened her horizons. Adapting the Agumenti spell had been a simple enough project. A jet of water spouted from her horn, spraying out in a fountain. It puddled neatly around her in a ring, and rose up, forming into the shape of a pegasus which started to trot around the stage.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cold is good too!&quot; A carefully shaped Cone of Cold froze it in place, rearing with it&#039;s wings outstretched.</p><p class="double">&quot;I notice you didn&#039;t try to do fire!&quot; Trixie said, dismissively. &quot;What&#039;s wrong? Too hot for you to handle?&quot;</p><p class="double">The statue exploded outwards, and in it&#039;s place was a similar shape made of fire, which flapped it&#039;s wings and rose into the air, leaving behind hoof prints burned into the deck. &quot;Not really, I just didn&#039;t want to damage your stage.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was hoof stomping and wild cheers from the audience as they watched the two unicorns match wits and magic. Wire frame illusions of Trixie&#039;s were countered by full colour images of Twilight&#039;s, her shield spell was tested by a fireball of Trixie&#039;s, while an irresistible dance enchantment was cancelled by Twilight&#039;s fail-safe spell.</p><p class="double">Twilight countered by casting a want it-need it spell on Trixie&#039;s hat, but one targeted at Trixie alone, which led to an amusing scene of Trixie hugging her hat to herself, stroking it and calling it &#039;my precious&#039;. Finally, a fed up Trixie conjured chains and a box and bound her in it, locking it with many locks, which did no good, as Twilight was still able to teleport.</p><p class="double">In return, when Twilight reappeared, she decide to show off a spell she&#039;d figured out from something she&#039;d heard human magicians did. A box appeared around Trixie&#039;s body, her head poking from one end, her tail from the other, and her legs sticking out the bottom. It was supported by two wheeled stands, and split into two sections, each with the sides cut out to show Trixie&#039;s body was still inside.</p><p class="double">Twilight cast a paired dimensional portal along the centre, then conjured two wooden dividers that dropped into place between the halves, to the shock of both the crowd and Trixie. Twilight pulled the halves apart and spun them so Trixie was looking at her own tail. &quot;You might want to add this to your act.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t...&quot; Trixie slumped. &quot;... I surrender! Put me back together! Please!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay.&quot; Twilight reversed things and Trixie was soon back in one piece. The stage unicorn turned to the crowd. &quot;The Great and Powerful... That is all for today. The show is over!&quot;</p><p class="double">There were groans and cries of more, but her friends helped get the crowd moving.</p><p class="double">Trixie was looking at Twilight as if for the first time. &quot;Who are you, really?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly who I said I was. Though I may not have mentioned that before I came to do research here in Ponyville, I was a student at Princess Celestia&#039;s School for Gifted Unicorns. Princess Celestia&#039;s own student actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blue unicorn slumped ion the floor of the stage. &quot;You tricked me! All the way from the beginning. Now I&#039;ll never be able to show my face in Ponyville again!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike had come up on stage and added, &quot;Yeah, you really showed her Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. &quot;That was never my intention. I kept on offering you a way out, and I meant it. If you&#039;d been willing to let things lie, we could have all walked away happy. Besides, all anyone will remember tomorrow was that the two of us put on a great show. Anyway, I would genuinely like to study your techniques. You&#039;re self taught?&quot;</p><p class="double">She knew the answer, having gotten Trixie very drunk on Applejack&#039;s best cider in a previous loop. Trixie was just as talkative in her cups, if not more so than usual. However, all she got right now was a nod.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then maybe an egghead bookworm can help you fill in the gaps. I&#039;m sure you could learn that &#039;Dividing a pony in two&#039; effect for a start. It&#039;s just a pair of linked dimensional portals. I&#039;m sure you could use it in your act.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are you being so nice to me?&quot; Trixie asked, and Spike echoed it. &quot;You know I was trying to show up you and your friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I already told you, you don&#039;t need to make others looks small to make yourself look big. You&#039;re better than that. Princess Celestia sent me here to study the magic of friendship, and that&#039;s the most powerful magic of all. So which is the better option? To humiliate you and send you packing, a laughing stock? Or to help you become better, become something more, and hopefully gain the friendship of a talented unicorn in return?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;d do that for me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... yes!&quot; Twilight&#039;s expression made it clear that her hesitation was purely for effect. &quot;I love my friends, and I love spending time with them, but I can&#039;t really talk about my studies with them. In Canterlot, I spent all my time studying, and no time making friends, and it&#039;s only now that I realise what I missed out on. The only ponies I can really talk to about my magic studies are the Princesses. Well, Luna and Celestia, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know... oh, you said didn&#039;t you. But what about Princess Luna?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I helped her out a while back. We&#039;ve stayed in touch.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike snorted. &quot;For &#039;helped out&#039; try freed her from Nightmare Moon and saved all Equestria from eternal night! She&#039;s also the Bearer of the Element of Magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike!&quot; Twilight huffed. &quot;It was a team effort, and besides there was a whole destiny thing going on. I don&#039;t make a big thing about it, some of the other Bearers would die from the attention. So I&#039;d ask you not to spread it around. I just want to be let alone to be with my friends and do my research. So, the offer&#039;s open...&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie was wide-eyed. &quot;You are an unnatural pony, Twilight Sparkle. You have the ears of the Princesses, and you could be one of the most famous ponies in Equestria, nay, the world! But you are happy to live here, in this village, almost unknown.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Different harmonies for different ponies. I know you&#039;d enjoy the fame, but I wouldn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie hung her head. &quot;The Contrite and Eager to Learn Trixie would be only too glad to study with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie had spent several hours with Twilight, running through some theoretical basics, and as a reward, getting taught the portal spell Twilight had used. She&#039;d returned to her wagon, and Twilight was just finishing off her nightly observations. Her plan had been a stunning success, and she only hoped that Trixie would end up being aware of the loops.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d felt a new bond of friendship forming, still weak and nascent, so the possibility existed. As the local anchor, she seemed to affect which ponies were able to loop, and friendship definitely had something to do with it. However, there was something niggling at her, like an un-ticked box on her check-list.</p><p class="double">A roar suddenly reminded her, and a quick glance from her vantage point on the observation deck confirmed it. She winked down to the ground and kicked in some alicorn speed to head towards where the Ursa Minor was heading for Ponyville. Hopefully she could get there before... There was a crunch in the distance as the Ursa Minor stepped on Trixie&#039;s wagon. She saw Spike approaching and scooped him up en passant.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, we&#039;ve got a...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, I saw.&quot;</p><p class="double">She skidded to a stop as Snips and Snails egged the unicorn on. She saw Trixie take her stand with the Ursa roaring in her face, and say, &quot;Uh, okay, stand back!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s rope trick failed as Twilight knew it would, but by that time she was up alongside the other unicorn. &quot;Huh, you don&#039;t see that every day. Need some help?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh uh!&quot; Snips called out. &quot;She&#039;s the Great and Powerful Trixie!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! She defeated an Ursa Major all by herself, she doesn&#039;t need your help!&quot; Snails added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! Yes, I do I do I do!&quot; Trixie exclaimed. &quot;I just made that story up to make myself look better! No-one can vanquish an Ursa Major!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Made it up?&quot; Snips and Snails chorused freaking out in stereo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then it&#039;s just as well that&#039;s an Ursa Minor, a baby.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a baby?&quot; Trixie squeaked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, looks cranky too. Someone must have woken it up and brought it here. But that would require a combination of insane luck and abject stupidity bordering on the imbecilic!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike just pointed at Snips and Snails, while the Ursa, clearly feeling left out of the conversation, brought it&#039;s head down and roared again.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed rather theatrically. &quot;Right... Trixie, ready for a practical exam?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and she cast the lullaby spell, flaring her magic so it touched Trixie through her still weak friendship link, letting her feel the spell weave. &quot;Feel that? Think you can take over?&quot;</p><p class="double">The music started to affect the Ursa, and it stopped roaring.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, but what are we doing?&quot; Trixie&#039;s magic flowed out, taking over as the Ursa&#039;s eyelids drooped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sonic enchantment, a number 16. Your story made me curious, so I did some research. It looks like some spirit, but it&#039;s actually a magical beast, though it does have an astral sub-type. That means it&#039;s toughness and strength are off the charts, so direct physical attacks won&#039;t cut it.</p><p class="double">&quot;It also has a degree of resistance to energy type magic attacks, and some general spell resistance. However, it&#039;s will isn&#039;t so hot. So enchantment and illusion spells work best, and using a sonic medium rather than a direct casting makes it harder for the spell resistance to stop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Ursa&#039;s eyelids were drooping, and it started to sway. &quot;Okay, if you can keep it pacified, I&#039;ll get it back where it belongs.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s eyes widened, &quot;You can&#039;t mean...&quot;</p><p class="double">The Ursa started to topple over, and Twilight caught it with her magic. With Trixie maintaining the lullaby, she didn&#039;t need to give it a bottle. Admittedly, she could have done it all by herself, but she was trying to avoid showing too much power.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s go!&quot; Her horn glow intensified, and the Ursa, curled up and looking almost cute, was lofted over the rooftops in the grip of Twilight&#039;s power. &quot;Manifest one of those clouds down on the ground, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie dropped the lullaby for a second to manifest a storm cloud, then caught it and restarted it before it had faded completely. Twilight&#039;s horn pulsed, and their hooves glow. She jumped up onto the cloud. &quot;Now hop on. Cloud walking spell.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie climbed on more gingerly, and tested the soft but supporting cloud underfoot. &quot;Good, guide us after the Ursa.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Ursa was delivered back to it&#039;s cave, and the trio returned on Trixie&#039;s cloud. Many of the ponies of Ponyville were up and about, including her friends. Trixie couldn&#039;t resist finishing off the music with a triumphant little flourish.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoo!&quot; &quot;Unbelievable!&quot; &quot;Amazing!&quot; &quot;Trixie did vanquish the Ursa Major.&quot; &quot;Yay for Trixie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight jumped down alongside Trixie, but said nothing. For a moment the other unicorn posed proudly, head high, then glanced aside at Twilight and relaxed into a more normal posture and sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I may have... exaggerated a bit on stage for effect. The Great and Powerful Trixie is not quite that great and powerful. Trixie may have helped, but it was Twilight who lead the way, and did most of the work.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. This was beyond her best expectations. &quot;It was a team effort, and what she doesn&#039;t say is that she was ready to take it on alone until I showed up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoee!&quot; Applejack exclaimed. &quot;And there I was figuring she was all hat and no cattle. I&#039;m sure sorry, Miss Trixie. I take my hat off to you, miss. Any-pony who can impress Twilight is a good apple in my book.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you!&quot; Trixie looked genuinely pleased and happy until she saw... &quot;My wagon!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave Snips and Snails a frown. &quot;I think you owe Trixie a major apology!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, an Ursa Major one!&quot; Spike quipped.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re sorry oh great and powerful one!&quot; &quot;We just wanted to see some awesome magic!&quot; &quot;And the way you and Twilight vanquished it was awesome!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two colts prostrated themselves in front of Trixie. &quot;We deserve whatever punishment you give us.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie glowered at them for a moment, then glanced over at Twilight again and smirked. &quot;Very well, you can be my assistants for my show, when my wagon&#039;s fixed. I have some new tricks, experimental ones, that I want to try out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, oh great and powerful one!&quot; &quot;Cool!&quot; It seemed this particular punishment didn&#039;t hold any great fear for the pair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, Trixie, if you&#039;re up for another new spell, maybe we can do something about that.&quot; Twilight stepped over beside her.</p><p class="double">&quot;But look at it, I&#039;ll have to utterly rebuild it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not necessarily.&quot; Actually, Twilight felt bad about it. If she hadn&#039;t gotten distracted training Trixie, she could have headed this off. &quot;While the bonds between ponies are strongest, you can love and care for other things too. Your cart wasn&#039;t always wrecked. Envision it in your mind, as it was when it was brand new. Smell the fresh paint, the wood, see the stage, the decorations... Do you have it well in mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes...&quot; Trixie was actually starting to tear up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good, now push that image into your magic, and push it into the wreckage. Tell it to go back to the way it was.&quot;</p><p class="double">A beam of lavender energy blasted from Trixie&#039;s horn, and the pieces of the wrecked wagon were thrown into the air, to swirl around in a vortex of energy. They fused together, shards and splinters slotting seamlessly into place, and eventually the spinning slowed down to reveal a fully restored wagon, shining in the moonlight to the awe of the crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, thank you Twilight!&quot; Trixie surprised the other unicorn by giving her a hug.</p><p class="double">&quot;You did all the work.&quot; Twilight gave an honest smile. Now this was a better way to end up than having Trixie running off, swearing vengeance. &quot;I&#039;m guessing Pinkie will have a &#039;you vanquished an Ursa Minor&#039; party before too long.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll see...&quot; she grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">5.4 Turning the Tables (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">Twilight awoke staring at her usual reference book. Her local memories cut in, and she decided this was pretty much a vanilla loop. She reached out to check something and found that Princess Celestia hadn&#039;t looped, not unexpected. She&#039;d decided the next opportunity she got to prank the Princess and this was it.</p><p class="double">She was well aware of Celestia&#039;s habit of using pranks to teach life lessons, and had decided to turn the tables for once. The Princess had left a lot of things to chance in the way she&#039;d manoeuvred Twilight into defeating Nightmare Moon, and this loop Twilight was going to call her on it.</p><p class="double">She stowed the book and headed for her study. On the way, as always, she met Twinkleshine and her friends, as normal.</p><p class="double">&quot;There you are, Twilight! Moondancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a pleasant smile. &quot;I&#039;d love to. But I have to study right now. I &#039;ll do my best to get over there later.&quot;</p><p class="double">Leaving the stunned ponies behind, she smirked. The game was afoot.</p><p class="double">Twinkleshine finally managed to close her open mouth. &quot;Did Twilight Sparkle just accept a party invitation?&quot;</p><p class="double">Carefully entering the tower room that was her study, she avoided bouncing Spike off the walls and wrecking his gift. &quot;Hi Spike! For me? You shouldn&#039;t have.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s for Moondancer…&quot; The little dragon looked at her oddly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that party they were talking about?&quot; She pretended to give the matter some thought.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know I don&#039;t normally have time for that sort of thing….&quot; Seeing Spike&#039;s tail droop, she added. &quot;But I guess there&#039;s nothing time critical about a bunch of ancient legends. Okay, Spike take a letter.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">I&#039;m writing to you to request continued access to the restricted archive. As you know as part of my continuing studies on pony magic I have been working on a research project on ancient legends. I had hoped to complete it before the Summer Sun Celebration, but my friend and companion Spike wishes to go to a party being held by Moondancer this evening. As his guardian, I feel that I should go with him. Of course, then there will be the preparations for Summer Sun Celebration, and it&#039;s likely to be impossible to get any work done until after that.</p><p class="double">As you know, my studies are my paramount concern, and I don&#039;t want you to think I&#039;m making light of the honour you gave me in making me your student, or the unique opportunities for study you&#039;ve provided me. However Spike is important to me too, and putting aside my studies for one night is a small thing compared to making him happy.</p><p class="double">Your faithful student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle.&#039;</p><p class="double">Spike had stopped writing half way through, as flabbergasted as the students earlier. &quot;You&#039;d do that? For me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight felt genuinely shocked and sorry at his surprise. Had she really been so insensitive in the base timeline? &quot;Of course! You&#039;re my number one assistant, and my best friend. And if you&#039;re that surprised by the fact, then this is long overdue!&quot;</p><p class="double">She repeated her message so Spike could write it down, and got him to send it. Of course, now she&#039;d made the commitment, she realised it was something she should have done long ago. Awake or not, Spike deserved it, and one of the few things she&#039;d never done was actually gone to that party.</p><p class="double">She was very interested to see how the Princess would react. Without Twilight finding the Mare in the Moon prophecy on her own, she&#039;d be in the position of having to either order her to continue her studies, which would then make it impossible to do the whole &#039;stop reading those stuffy books and make some friends&#039; line, or find some other way to guide her to the same end.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='6'></a><h3>Loops 6</h3>
<p>Caution - this loop (6.1) is probably the worst in the entire compilation, almost certainly the worst by me. It&#039;s poorly done, has misconceptions, has outright mistakes, and generally speaking is rubbish. Do NOT rely on it for an accurate impression of the setting it crosses with; indeed, go read that setting and decide for yourself.</p><p class="double">I&#039;m keeping it here only to remind myself, in the future, that I can write absolute tat. So I should try not to.</p><p class="double">6.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked awake. “Oh. Hmmm, large wagon stuffed with books… ooh, maybe I’m replacing Trixie this Loop. That might be fun-”</p><p class="double">At that point, the Loop memories arrived.</p><p class="double">“WHAT?” The shout almost shook the wagon. “Okay, no. No way in Tartarus am I going along with <i>this</i> loop.”</p><p class="double">Luna being the reigning Princess? Fine. That had happened before.</p><p class="double">Trixie, not her, being the Element of Magic? Entirely sensible. No problems there.</p><p class="double">But her being obsessive about the technical definition of magic? Having grown up nearly friendless, with Shining apparently having taken no hoof in her life?</p><p class="double"><i>Like. Buck.</i></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hi.”</p><p class="double">Trixie, Element of Magic and Student of Princess Luna, turned. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, well, I’m Twilight Sparkle. Kind of a fan, actually, but anyway – I had a question. Those Elements of Harmony? Ever tried setting them to broad beam?”</p><p class="double">Trixie frowned. “Do what?”</p><p class="double">“Broad beam. As per the paper by Lucky Strike in seven-thirty-four, any harmonic effect spell can be set to a number of modes from narrow beam to continent cleanse, as they’re refinements of the original area-burst effect made use of by Clover, Pansy and Cookie at the Founding.” Twilight rattled off magical formulae, parading out academic papers in front of the increasingly bewildered Trixie. “…so if you induce a deliberate harmonic of 14 hertz on the primary element and 15-20 inclusive on the others, it should produce a cresting-wave form which spreads to cover an area of reasonable size, and hence catch any quiescent or otherwise unnoticed corruption of any type in the area. And, well, better safe than sorry and all that.”</p><p class="double">“…sorry, did you have a point?” Trixie asked. “I lost track less than half way into that.”</p><p class="double">“But I thought you were Princess Luna’s special student?” Twilight asked, puzzled. “This stuff is final year optional material at the academy, admittedly, but I read the syllabus and it’s on one of the most often taken secondary modules. You… didn’t take it?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Trixie replied. “I focused more on practical applications of magic, thank you.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight frowned. “That’s actually very disappointing. Well, sorry to trouble you.” With a flash, Twilight disappeared, leaving her notes and papers.</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked. <i>I didn’t even feel a magical signature from that teleport… it just happened.</i></p><p class="double">Maybe this Twilight <i>was</i> onto something… it couldn’t hurt to look, she supposed…</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“…so, long story short, there’s a big difference between working hard and actively trying to push out all competitors.” Twilight explained to Applejack. “It’s just not conducive to good will, if nothing else.”</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>that</i> explains a whole lot.” Applejack said, looking into the middle distance. “If they’d only gone and told me that instead of carryin’ on about <i>that</i> ah was wrong, ah’d have had a lot better idea what they were after tryin’ to say.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Glad to help.”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“What the hell are you doing asleep!”</p><p class="double">Dash jerked awake, and looked over to see a purple pegasus with her forelegs crossed, hovering next to the cloud.</p><p class="double">“Who are-”</p><p class="double">“You’re Rainbow Dash, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Dash replied, confused. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“What did you get your cutie mark for, <i>sleeping?</i> You’re an athlete, not a lazybones!”</p><p class="double">Stung, Dash made a grab for her tormenter, who slipped easily out of the way. “Hey, get back here!”</p><p class="double">“You’re supposed to be <i>fast</i>.” The pegasus stuck her tongue out. “Make me.”</p><p class="double">Seeing red, Dash launched herself forwards.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight grinned, pumping her wings hard. This version of Dash was a layabout, which made frankly <i>no</i> sense given she still had the rainbow-thunderbolt cutie mark indicating that she’d broken the sound barrier in the past. Twilight had the sense her friend had slipped into a destructive spiral at some point in the past, like Applejack and the others.</p><p class="double">And when Dash went into a destructive spiral, there was precisely one way to get her out of it.</p><p class="double">Going into a spin, Twilight shaped the weather magic around her, then flared her wings and dropped abruptly out of the chase. Dash, startled, overshot and kept going – into a horizontal tail wind Twilight had set up.</p><p class="double"><i>BOOM.</i></p><p class="double">“My work here is done.” Twilight grinned, transitioning through alicorn and back to unicorn. “Now, where’s Fluttershy…”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Why are we doing this?” Lyra asked.</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed, rubbing her temples. “Look, some unicorn came up to me and handed me this ridiculously detailed – like, thesis length – documentation on how harmony based effects work, and she seemed really disappointed I couldn’t follow it. Like I’d let her down, or something. I just thought I… I didn’t want all her work to be in vain, okay?”</p><p class="double">Ditzy nodded. “Makes sense!”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Trixie focused, pulling gently on the thread connected to the Element of Magic. It responded, slightly wilfully at first – then there seemed to be an almost audible <i>click</i> and it fell into place.</p><p class="double">Concentrating hard, she worked in a frequency flutter to each element as it activated. <i>Right, that’s all of them, now what-</i></p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Rainbow light chased across the country. Misty shapes, like horses, fled as it approached.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Princess Luna blinked. “What the <i>buck</i> was I <i>thinking?</i> Of <i>course</i> hereditary nobility is a bad idea if you don’t give them oversight and let them punish entire towns for a slight! <i>Gaah!”</i></p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight nodded to herself – job well done. “I thought so. Celestia’s magic is kind of important in keeping the northern barrier intact, so without her we had a serious case of Windigo.”</p><p class="double">Rarity and Fluttershy were a little more shocked – having just got at least a bit used to a Pinkie Pie Party, the rush of strangely familiar magic had caused them to drop their cake.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that reminds me.” Twilight levitated out an orange-chased egg. “This is a phoenix egg I found. Would you mind taking care of it, Fluttershy? I’m sure you’ll do fine.”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">6.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Marvellous work, Rarity.” Sapphire Shores said, looking her new dress over. “I must say, you did <i>excellent</i> work.”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. Every time, the dress for Sapphire was different. No coasting for <i>this</i> fashion designer!</p><p class="double">“Oh, that reminds me,” the diva continued. “I was having a talk with one of your friends outside, and she made the most marvellous suggestion. I’d like to have at least fifty-two dresses, please. By next week if possible.”</p><p class="double">Rarity’s eyes bulged beneath her mane. “<i>How</i> many?”</p><p class="double">“Fifty two. Oh, and they each have to be made of a single, different material. Must rush, so I’ll be back for them in a week.” Sapphire said, and left before Rarity could close her gaping jaw.</p><p class="double">Twilight came in, looking over her shoulder at the departing fashion icon. “Sorry, Rarity. I didn’t think she’d actually do it.”</p><p class="double">“No, this is… is… perfect!” Rarity gasped, and began moving things around. “Right, I need… let’s see… I need the element of Generosity. Magical healing does away with the need for sleep, right?”</p><p class="double">“I-” Twilight cut off her own sentence, as she watched Rarity dashing around and picking up more and more objects in her TK. “Did she say how much she’d pay?”</p><p class="double">“Well, no…” the levitating tools slowed for a moment, then accelerated again. “But who cares! This shall be my crowning achievement!” Rarity summoned the Element of Generosity, and activated its secondary healing power. “To work!”</p><p class="double">“Right, you seem to have things under control.” Twilight said brightly, backing out of the door. “Let me know if you need anything.”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Okay…” Rarity ticked off, eyes shining. “Silk, cotton, flax, linen, satin, velvet, lycra, hay, that newfangled nylon… oh, of course, wool! I must not forget wool!” Two knitting needles levitated into the air, and got to work knitting a dress. “I have to <i>emphasize</i> the unique qualities of each material, not downplay them…”</p><p class="double">She frowned. “Does Cashmere count as a kind of wool? I don’t know, how frustrating! Oh, it must be, I’ll make it <i>very</i> distinctive!”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle held her pillow over her ears. Rarity was <i>still</i> going! It had been three days!</p><p class="double">Eventually she reached a decision. “Hey, Sis, I’m going to go sleep over at Applebloom’s house!”</p><p class="double">“Okay!” Rarity replied, distractedly. “Ask Twilight to take you!”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thirty-one.” Rarity said, eyes drooping. “And I can’t think of <i>any</i> fabric I’ve missed.”</p><p class="double">Then an idea came to her. “Unless… it doesn’t have to be <i>fabric</i>, exactly…”</p><p class="double">She turned the taps on in the bathtub, letting them run with the plug in while she cleared more space in the central room of the boutique. Once there was most of a tub full of water ready, she drew it out in a shimmering sheet and applied Oerth magic to it.</p><p class="double"><i>Shrink Item.</i></p><p class="double">The tub full of water compacted to a small sheet of glittering, deep blue, translucent cloth. It gradually grew as more water was directed into it, and Rarity pondered if maybe she could mix in fresh water and salt water into the resultant outfit.</p><p class="double">“Oh, and if there’s water, then there simply <i>has</i> to be <i>fire!</i>”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes, kicking water down on the fire. “Rarity, you could have at least put the thing out before you left…”</p><p class="double">“Be fair.” Twilight replied. “She’s not slept in, what, five days? Even the Element of Generosity can only do so much to prevent tiredness.”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“…Rarity?”</p><p class="double">Twilight knocked on the door. No reply.</p><p class="double">“Rarity!”</p><p class="double">Eventually, she decided there was nothing for it and opened the door telekinetically. There was a <i>flumph</i> as a dozen outfits landed on her, driven out by the sheer pressure.</p><p class="double">“Pleh.” Shaking her head, she kicked herself free, rolled upright and teleported into the boutique.</p><p class="double">“Rarity?”</p><p class="double">A mumbled reply came from upstairs. Twilight followed it, stepping over the piles of clothes. They started off fairly normal, but got more and more outlandish as she moved into the building. Just in the ones Twilight stepped over, there was a translucent ball gown that looked like it was made of water – and, it would seem, <i>was</i>… a piece made of condensed moonlight, and how Rarity had pulled <i>that</i> off Twilight had no idea, and a… a…</p><p class="double">Twilight stopped. “That’s a barrier jacket. Those are made of solid <i>magic</i>. Wow, she really is pulling some special stuff off. Ooh, diamond chain mail…”</p><p class="double">Shaking her head, she got back on task. She’d counted fifty-three on the ground floor, and another two on the stairs (extruded sapphire scales bound together by wafer-thin sapphire sheets, all with an ocean motif, and a glittering gold foil outfit that <i>had</i> to be held together by magic.)</p><p class="double">“Twilight.” Rarity’s exhausted voice came from her room. “Would it be proper for me to make the last one out of my own feathers, or is that a bit gauche? I can’t tell any more.”</p><p class="double">Rounding the corner, Twilight looked in. Rarity was staring at herself in a mirror, deep bags under her eyes and mane unkempt. And she had wings.</p><p class="double">“Rarity, how long is it since you slept?”</p><p class="double">The alicorn blinked slowly. “…I don’t remember. I think it got dark six times but I didn’t go to sleep. Too much work. Too many ideas. Just one left.”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “Rarity, you’re an alicorn.”</p><p class="double">“Am I?” Rarity said, looking back at herself. “Huh. Wings. Must be where the feathers came from.”</p><p class="double">“Get some sleep, Rarity.” Twilight said gently. “You lost count – you’ve done fifty-five. More than enough.”</p><p class="double">“…oh. Okay.” The couch zipped in out of nowhere, and Rarity collapsed onto it.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well?” Dash asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight shot her a grin. “It worked, all right.”</p><p class="double">The two sat in companionable silence, watching as Sapphire Shores and her assistants went ga-ga over every single outfit they got out of the building.</p><p class="double">After a while, Fluttershy joined them. “I heard from Applejack. Rarity really is something, isn’t she?”</p><p class="double">“You all are.” Twilight countered. “I’d say I was, too, but that’s boasting.”</p><p class="double">“I’ll say it for you!” Dash volunteered. “So long as you do the same for me.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like a deal.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy raised a hoof. “Uh… how long is Rarity going to be asleep? Shouldn’t we be there when she wakes up?”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry.” Twilight replied, with a grin. “I think we’ll know.”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“…eeeeeeeeeEEEEEEE! OH. MY.

Only, not human people. They’ve got pointier ears. Hi!”</p><p class="double">A harsh-faced humanoid looked her over. “…okay, what am I on?”</p><p class="double">“Silly, you’re not on anything! Except a planet. But I know what you’re going to be in!” Pinkie reached into her mane, and pulled. Out came a large, cartoonish bomb with a fizzing fuse. “Party petard armed! Firework in the hole!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight stumbled, having Awoken mid-trot. Getting back into the rhythm of things, she reached out with her supernatural senses. “Okay… habitable planet, unoccupied… hugely stormy space, lots of psychic-magic energy everywhere… wow, but I can’t really tell where I am…”</p><p class="double">There was a small positive signal on her Element, though. The Element of Laughter was active, and it was Pinkie’s one. “Wonder where <i>she</i> is,” Twilight said, sitting down on the surface of the world that would later be known as Macharia.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“No, no, no!” Pinkie said, shaking her head. “That is <i>NOT</i> how you do a party!”</p><p class="double">Two of the figures looked belligerent, and the third turned from a (thankfully as-yet unused) set of knives. “Oh? What would you know about it?”</p><p class="double">“Let me show you!” Pinkie grinned. “Hey, hand these out.” Reaching into her mane again, she pulled out a huge number of sealed envelopes. “Use that cool glowy-walky thing!”</p><p class="double">“The web way,” one of them deadpanned.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that!”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Eldarad Ulthuan tripped over his own cloak and fell face down on the floor.</p><p class="double">That was when he realized two things. The first was that being the butt of a joke wasn’t very fun. And the second was that it was time to get out of Eldar space <i>right now</i>.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>The Emperor looked to the heavens.

Hey, I ran into some nasty stern people who didn’t know how to party. But I showed them <i>exactly</i> how to party!” Pinkie bounced upside down. “They <i>all</i> really, really liked my party!”</p><p class="double">Twilight counted under her breath. She’d turned up in this Loop about two years ago, so… and it all looked horribly familiar all of a sudden…</p><p class="double">“Pinkie,” she asked, carefully. “Did you just hold a year-long party for an entire starfaring civilization?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Pinkie replied.</p><p class="double">“Great. Well, I suppose that makes sense. Congratulations, you have actually topped the list of strangest things we’ve ever replaced in a Loop.” True to form, Twilight got out a list. She went past things like <i>Rarity – Marigold Heavenly Nostrils</i> and <i>All of us – The Power Rangers</i>, and then slowed down at the very end of the list. Plucking a quill and ink out of the air, she wrote on a new entry. <i>“Pinkie Pie – Slaanesh.</i> Right. Well, this universe is FUBAR now… feel like messing with the Chaos Gods?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie’s smile shone. “DO I?”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">**from the memoirs of Ciaphas Cain** (via Nikas)</p><p class="double"> &quot;Jurgen, were did you get that cake?&quot;</p><p class="double">My aide pointed behind me, &quot;The pink pony brought it for the party.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What part...&quot; I turned and beheld it, her. A pink, or rather <b>PINK</b> hide that would glow in the deepest starless space. Incredibly wide blue eyes. If one could be said to drown in eyes, these could sink Holy Terra without a trace. The Xeno had a form that could be considered Equine, if only in a child&#039;s scribblings.

Twilight’s memories told her she was apparently a feral unicorn who was wandering the world after her old home had been destroyed, a world which apparently contained humans. She was in a forest, which thinned out ahead, and animals were fleeing past her. There was also the sound of what she could now identify as gunshots.</p><p class="double">She ran forward to the edge of the woods, which opened out onto a snow-covered meadow, with grass just starting to peek through. Deer were fleeing, and even as she watched, one of them fell, her young foal racing ahead without seeing it happen. Seeing the hunters getting closer, led by an arrogant looking human with a cleft chin and bulging muscles, she reacted instinctively.</p><p class="double">A massive illusion of Spike in his Nightfury form swooped down on them, sending the group fleeing, and under cover of it, she teleported out, reached out to encompass the deer in her teleport, and warped back, deep into the forest. Drawing on her loop as a nurse, she examined the wound. It wasn’t fatal, but soon would be.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, her fine telekinetic control allowed her to withdraw the bullet, and healing magic cleaned and healed the wound. A foal stumbled across her a few moments later, calling out.</p><p class="double">“Mother, where are you?” He came to a splay legged stop on seeing his mother, who was just starting to stir. He dropped down by her and snuggled up, crying.</p><p class="double">“Bambi… you have to get away…” She said weakly.</p><p class="double">Twilight realised that they weren’t actually speaking in the normal sense, and that this version of unicorn apparently came with the gift of tongues. That was a keeper. “It’s alright, you’re deep in the forest. I don’t think any of those hunters will be coming in here any time soon.”</p><p class="double">The snow had started up again, but Twilight just put up a low level shield to guide it away. The older deer just looked at her curiously, but the foal, Bambi spoke out. “Gosh, you look funny.”</p><p class="double">That got Twilight conjuring a mirror to get a first good look at herself. She was her normal colouration, but her body was shaped more like a horse, and scaled as one if the deer were anything to go by. “I’m a unicorn. Your mother was hurt, but she’d going to be alright. You should stay with her. “</p><p class="double">Noticing that they were both quite thin, she pulled a bale of hay from her subspace pocket and dropped it by them. She heard rustling, and saw another deer, a stallion with magnificent antlers approaching and decided that she could leave them alone. Besides, she’d thrown out an alarm spell, and it had just tripped. It appeared one of the hunters hadn’t been scared off, at least not far enough.</p><p class="double">She teleported to near his location and stepped out in front of him, glaring.</p><p class="double">“I thought I saw something in the meadow. What a magnificent beast! You will make a fine trophy for the wall of the inn!”</p><p class="double">Whatever else was wrong with him, there was no problem with his reflexes, and he brought his musket up to his shoulder and fired in a single smooth motion.</p><p class="double">The bullet came to a dead stop three inches in front of Twilight’s chest. “No, I won’t.”</p><p class="double">Her telekinesis lifted him off the floor and held him immobile as she pried the weapon from his hands.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm. Muzzle loading, flintlock action, rifled barrel. Basic but useful.”</p><p class="double">“Give that back! I am Gaston, the finest hunter in the village, and demand you return it, creature!”</p><p class="double">A small application of energy made the barrel glow red hot, and her telekinesis quickly twisted it into a pretzel. Cooling it equally quickly, and wrecking the temper of the metal in the process, she dropped it back in his hands.</p><p class="double">“There you go. Now, we’re going to this village, and I will discuss the proper way to treat a unicorn.”</p><p class="double">With him still floating along behind her like an impatient balloon, she trotted through the snowstorm in the direction of the other hunters. Gaston kept up a litany composed in equal parts of how awesome he was and what he’d do to her when he got free of her sorcery. He even started singing about it.</p><p class="double">She could have shut him up with a silence spell, but his discourse was so illuminating, she let him carry on. He sounded across between Rainbow Dash at her worst, and the Trixie in full boast mode. His musical enumeration of his many ‘virtues’ confirmed her initial opinion that he was a brutal, bullying thug, with all the grace and charm of a slug… no that was being unfair to slugs.</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">6.7 (via Filraen)</p><p>(The Ranma loop that used to be here was incomplete, and has been removed at request of the original author.

I should have written before now, but I’ve been crazy deep in my studies, and I know you’re really busy too. I’m ashamed to say this isn’t just a social letter, I need your help really badly. I found an ancient legend about Nightmare Moon. From my research, she isn’t just some fantasy figure to appease with sweets on Nightmare Night, she really existed!</p><p class="double">The legends say she was Princess Celestia’s sister, and once controlled the moon and night, but she turned evil and Princess Celestia locked her away using something called the Elements of Harmony. I haven’t been able to find out anything more about these, but they appear to have been a really powerful magic artefact.</p><p class="double">Why am I telling you this? Because the same legends say Nightmare Moon will return on the longest day of the thousandth year, the day after tomorrow. There’s a superior conjunction of minor moons which will align with our primary moon, and cause an amplification effect. The legend refers to it by saying ‘the stars will aid her escape’. Her stated goal was to bring eternal night, so her first action will obviously be to attack Princess Celestia.</p><p class="double">I’ve passed my findings to Princess Celestia, but she’s just told me not to worry, and is sending me to oversee the Summer Sun Celebrations in Ponyville. I know I should trust her judgement, but I’m worried that without the Elements of Harmony, and with Nightmare Moon’s powers amplified by the conjunction, she might not be able to handle Nightmare Moon on her own.</p><p class="double">That’s where you come in. I know it’s asking a lot, but if you can find a way to visit Ponyville tomorrow and stay for the Summer Sun Celebration, you could be on site to help. In my studies, I’ve located a magical amplifier called the Alicorn amulet that would boost your powers. It has the side effect of corrupting the user, but I’m certain that with your power of love, and my wide knowledge of spell-craft we can purify it before you use it.</p><p class="double">I’ll continue to research other avenues as much as my duties allow, but this could be the one chance we have to defeat Nightmare Moon, not that it wouldn’t be wonderful just to see you again. Maybe the library in Ponyville has something on these Elements. </p><p class="double">Your friend,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">P.S.

They decided to see if it was possible that a society could last built not upon pragmatism and wariness, but upon trust and friendship.</p><p class="double">“Five hundred and fifteen earth ponies, four hundred and ninety-two unicorns, and five hundred and six pegasi first founded this country. They made it a haven for all, regardless of race, breed or species.”</p><p class="double">Everyone in the plaza already knew this, but such was the reputation of the Princesses that her voice was the only sound in the whole massed square.</p><p class="double">“When I and my sisters first came across Equestria, we joined as any other – farmers, shopkeepers, students. We were asked to become the rulers of the country three times. Twice, we refused… and the third time, of course, we accepted. But only on condition that we be <i>princesses</i>, never queens, for the people of Equestria are her true rulers.</p><p class="double">“We have ruled long, and – we hope – well, but nothing can last forever and it falls to us all to make plans for the future, even if that future may never come. Accordingly, my sisters and I have discussed the matter at great length, and have decided to each select one champion to bear our symbol.”</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped back, and Pinkie Pie, Princess of Laughter, replaced her.</p><p class="double">“I pick Dissy! Oh, er, Discord of Wizard’s Peak!”</p><p class="double">A rather startled dragon jumped. “Er… me?”</p><p class="double">“Yes you, silly!” Pinkie giggled. “Unless you’re just pretending to be Dissy, because if you are then no.”</p><p class="double">The indicated dragon, still looking a bit shocked, walked numbly up to the stage.</p><p class="double">Pinkie levitated her Element necklace off her neck and onto Discord’s. “There ya go!”</p><p class="double">Applejack had already taken the stand. “Ah think the best representative of me’d be Cadance.”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>One by one, the six Princesses picked their ‘champions’.

For some reason, Sombra and Chrysalis just kept being in relationships…</p><p class="double">It would be interesting to see how this loop played out. All six of those they’d chosen were only about twenty or so. The same age <i>they</i> had been the first time they’d taken up their own Elements, in the original Equestria.</p><p class="double">Actually, engineering a completely cosmopolitan Equestria had been a fun enough challenge. </p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>6.12 (via Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Usagi wanted to cry.

Complete with a small arsenal of guns which the American Magical Girl quickly employed.</p><p class="double">The situation was stalemated, and Usagi and Mamoru where looking for a discreet place to change when a pony in a western dress and cowboy boots nudged her aside with a muttered “excuse me”. Whirling a lasso she roped the monster, pinning it in place. &quot;Now sugarcube!&quot; the magical mascot yelled.</p><p class="double">With a smile Megan shot the current monster with a rainbow charge out of her Winchester to disperse it. She waved to the crowd before she and Applejack shot off. Leaving behind Usagi, who was ranting to her fiancée: why did the gaijin get a useful mascot, while she was stuck with a lazy cat!</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“You realize that I haven’t had to do <i>anything</i>?” Twilight asked. “Admittedly, being a spiritual advisor is kind of neat…”</p><p class="double">“Just shows Megan’s up t’ the job.” Applejack replied calmly.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Applejack lowered her hat, and spat out the wheat stalk she was chewing. &quot;Mount up Megan, time to show this here badguy how we buck the apples.&quot; </p><p class="double">Rummaging for a moment, Megan got out a Springfield Carbine and slapped in a round. “You got it, Applejack.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">6.13 (from Namar13766)</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around. &quot;Okay, it&#039;s the day before Luna&#039;s first Nightmare Night. Any suggestions so that she enjoys it from the get-go instead of canceling it first?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy gave what would have been an uncharacteristic smile for her pre-loop self. &quot;Pinkie and I had an idea...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded to Vinyl, who put the record on, and then started cuing in the dancers. If she got this perfectly, it would hit the chorus just as Luna broke the cloud layer.</p><p class="double"><i>“It’s close to midnight…</i></p><p><i>Something evil&#039;s lurkin&#039;in the dark</p><p>Under the moonlight</p><p>You see a sight that almost stops your heart</p><p>You try to scream</p><p>But terror takes the sound before you make it</p><p>You start to freeze</p><p>As horror looks you right between the eyes</p><p>You&#039;re paralyzed</p><p class="double">&#039;Cause this is thriller…”</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“How did your night out go, Sister?” Celestia asked, as Luna walked up the steps.</p><p class="double">“BRILLIANT!” Luna boomed, then flushed and lowered her voice. “The pink one played a song that could have been <i>written</i> for Nightmare Night! And I got so. Much. Candy!”</p><p class="double">“She’s right, you know.” Meadowlark muttered around a mouthful of toffee, the guard not missing a step as he followed his principal. “I didn’t know there was that much sugar in Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear.” Celestia said, stifling a grin. “That explains the letter I got.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>“Dear Princess Celestia.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I think I’m having a sugar rush.

<p>7.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around. It was the evening after the formation of the Elements, and the purification of Luna. Since the purple Anchor was planning on experimenting with events at the Gala, she’d done it effectively as she had in the original time line.</p><p class="double">The pink-and-yellow alicorn hovering outside her bedroom window sort of suggested her plans were going to have to change, though.</p><p class="double">“Cadence!” she said, quietly but happily. “Hold on.” A silence spell manifested around Spike’s bed. “Okay, come around to the balcony, I’ll let you in.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So you’re Looping this time?” Twilight asked, levitating over a glass of sparkling water. “It’s nice to see you. What’s the plan this time?”</p><p class="double">“You always let me plan things, Twilight.” Cadence said, accepting the drink and sipping it. “That’s nice of you.”</p><p class="double">“Well, it <i>is</i> fairly rare I see you.” Twilight reminded her. “I know it seems different from your perspective, but I <i>do</i> have a fair number of lonely Loops.”</p><p class="double">“I can imagine.” After a moment, Cadence changed topics. “Anyway, there’s some good news. And I need to ask you for a few favours.”</p><p class="double">“…okay.” Twilight answered warily, suddenly suspicious.</p><p class="double">“Favours first.” Cadence said. “First, I’d like everything right up to my wedding to go exactly the same as it did the first time around. I’m sorry if that’s wearing on you, but I’d really like the wedding to go as planned the first time.”</p><p class="double">“No, it’s no hardship.” Twilight assured her. “Actually, after the last loop it might be nice to relax a bit.”</p><p class="double">“Last Loop?” Cadence pried.</p><p class="double">“Something very energetic involving giant robots again. Fun, but after a while you just want to relax, you know?” Twilight tapped a hoof. “Though Dash <i>did</i> beat up that Starscream robot in a very impressive way… anyway. The second thing?”</p><p class="double">“Do you know a temporary memory spell?” Cadence asked. “Something that temporarily – <i>not</i> permanently – prevents a pony from remembering something?”</p><p class="double">“I… think I do.” Twilight said. “Or I can have one fairly soon, an adaptation of Obliviation. But why? You’re starting to worry me…”</p><p class="double">“And third,” Cadence said, “I want you to bring a lump of Cosmic Spectrum with you when you rescue me from the mines.”</p><p class="double">Twilight put two and two together. “Shiny’s awake?!”</p><p class="double">“Well done.” Cadence grinned. “Yes, he is, and it’s <i>such</i> a relief. But you know why I’m asking for all those things?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Twilight began pacing. “You want the wedding to go <i>exactly</i> as it did the first time, so if Shiny’s awake you’ll need him to not remember about Chrysalis – otherwise, even if he’s good at acting, his emotions will give him away. You have much better control of your emotions because that’s what your talent is about, so you’re fine, and I can fake what we need effectively. And it’s too good an opportunity to miss.”</p><p class="double">“Precisely.” Cadence said. “Now, if we <i>do</i> want things to go right, we’ll have to stay out of touch for a fair while. Otherwise you’ll be just too credible…”</p><p class="double">“I understand.” The unicorn gave a determined nod. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sat back, watching the familiar glow building on the horns of Shining Armor and Cadence. It was always impressive to watch, this, but – considering that she could see the lump of Cosmic Spectrum Cadence had stuffed into his outfit – she rather thought her brother was about to outdo himself.</p><p class="double">With a concussive <i>boom</i>, the shield/exclusion spell hit criticality and bloomed outwards, picking up all the Changelings and throwing them away.</p><p class="double">…actually, by the looks of things the shield had expanded to the size of the entire <i>country</i>. That was a first.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well done, Shiny.” Cadence said, and snapped the thread of the spell Twilight had applied last month with a quick flicker of magic.</p><p class="double">“What- oh.” Shining Armor stood up, shakily, and looked around. “Did you block my memory of last time that – that… of last time Chrysalis attacked?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Cadence said, looking down and shuffling her hooves. “But it was for a good cause.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Shining asked. “<i>Really?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Cadence flicked a hoof out, and Shining’s thought processes abruptly shut down as his girlfriend tapped him on the wing.</p><p class="double">“Darling…” he asked, with impressive calmness, “Why do I have wings?”</p><p class="double">“I said it was for a good cause,” she replied impishly. Then glanced over at Twilight. “You can explain things, right?”</p><p class="double">“Think so.” Twilight replied. “I’ll say it was a wedding gift you were going to give, and explain to Celestia and Luna a shortened version of what happened. But in my experience it takes an hour for the wedding to get back on track, so be back by then.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Cadence nodded her thanks, then grabbed Shining Armor in a curtain of magic and teleported fifty miles east to an unoccupied country estate.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight watched as Gilda ranted, berating Dash and every other pony in the room.</p><p class="double">She knew it was hard on her friend to face this, and more so when she’d recently started looping and had to face it more than once…</p><p class="double">The griffin finally finished, panting, and turned to go.</p><p class="double">“Wait.” Dash said, the calm word sounding all the louder by contrast with Gilda’s shouts.</p><p class="double">Gilda turned, almost against her will.</p><p class="double">“Look,” the pegasus continued. “I’m not good at speaking – you know that – so sorry if this isn’t all fancy and… I’m making this up as I go, okay? I… I <i>do</i> like you. You’re one of my oldest friends. You were <i>there</i> for me, back at flight school…”</p><p class="double">Everyone else was silent, listening to Dash’s voice. She’d lost the calm she’d had earlier, and the words were strained.</p><p class="double">“But… I don’t know. Maybe you’ve changed, maybe I’ve changed, maybe I’m just noticing it now and I didn’t care before. But you just… you aren’t nice. More importantly – though it shouldn’t be – you aren’t nice to my other friends.” Twilight spotted that Dash’s eyes were shining with unshed tears, and a look over at Gilda showed that the griffin’s own face was screwed up like she didn’t know <i>what</i> to think.</p><p class="double">“Please, Gilda.” Dash said, her voice wavering. “Don’t make me choose between my friends.”</p><p class="double">Gilda blinked, scowling, then shook her head. “I… gaah! Why does this have to be so hard! I don’t know what to – and – aargh!”</p><p class="double">“Look, you don’t have to be all sweetness and light. That wouldn’t be <i>you.</i>” The ghost of a smile crept across Dash’s face. “Just… I dunno, give me your address or something. We’ll work from there.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I guess that works.” Gilda said, then looked around at the other ponies. “This never happened, okay?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded encouragingly. “For some reason, I’ve been struck blind. And deaf.”</p><p class="double">“Me too!” Pinkie said. “Ooh, where am I?”</p><p class="double">Gilda surprised herself with a tired chuckle. “Heh. Okay, fine. I think I know your address. I’ll send you a letter after I think it over, alright?”</p><p class="double">“That’s fine.” Dash nodded. “Hey, maybe you can come to the Best Young Fliers. I’ve got a great set planned!”</p><p class="double">“Wouldn’t miss it.” Gilda said, and Twilight realized she meant it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well done, Dash.” Twilight said, beaming. “That must have been tricky for you.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Dash replied, shaking her head. “I can’t believe I <i>said</i> half the stuff I said there.”</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “Yeah, funny how that works. Maybe next time you can try and get it sorted out earlier – I mean, if you get to know how she is now this loop.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Dash shrugged. “I just… I dunno. Maybe she felt like how Pinkie was behaving was too much like what it was like when we were bullied? I know she stuck up for me back at Flight School.”</p><p class="double">“Could be.” Twilight agreed. “From what I know of griffin culture, though, they’re very impressed by strength – not just strength in battle, either. Strength of character, strength of will… maybe if Fluttershy was a bit more confident, or…”</p><p class="double">“Don’t know.” Dash replied. “Something to try out, maybe. Now I’m going to go and see if I remember how to write a letter…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon spread her wings, rearing back. “The Night Will-”</p><p class="double">As was getting fairly normal for Equestria’s Time Loops, she didn’t finish the sentence. What was <i>un</i>usual, though, was that she got tackled by a gigantic purple dragon.</p><p class="double">“Excellent work, my faithful minion!” a dark-purple-and-black alicorn boomed, eyes flaring and a wan light emanating from her. “Day and Night are outdated. This shall forever more be the land of twilight!”</p><p class="double">“Actually,” the dragon asked, looking up from hog-tying Nightmare Moon. “How are we going to do that? I mean, the sun has to be up or down, right?”</p><p class="double">“Use my title!” the alicorn snapped.</p><p class="double">“Fine, then.” The eighty-foot dragon rolled his eyes. “Eternal Twilight, Lady of the Morning and the Evening. How are we going to actually <i>do</i> this?”</p><p class="double">“Well… put the sun at the place it is at sunrise, and the moon at moonset.” Eternal Twilight said, her voice losing the echoing quality slightly. “You know. Like in the morning. Or the evening.”</p><p class="double">“But…” the dragon didn’t let it go that easily, and ponies began to creep back out of their hiding places to watch. “The world is round, right?”</p><p class="double">“Of course, Spykoranuvellitar!” Eternal Twilight answered promptly. “You know that.”</p><p class="double">The Great Wyrm nodded. “Yeah, yeah. So… if you make it so it’s twilight in Ponyville, then if you walk forty miles east… what is it?”</p><p class="double">“…oh.” The alicorn kicked the stage. “I didn’t think of that. It would be morning, of course. Cursed Celestia! She foils me without even trying!”</p><p class="double">The two interlopers stood there for a moment, awkwardly shuffling their feet.</p><p class="double">“What about overcast?” Spykoranuvellitar suggested. “Maybe you could invent glowing clouds or something.”</p><p class="double">“Of course!” Eternal’s voice went right back to the booming, echoing shout. “Hurry, my faithful minion! We must establish a major and permanent cloudbank, which is also on fire at the top. To Cloudsdale!”</p><p class="double">“And that’s another thing.” Spykoran added, taking flight after the alicorn and smashing a hole in the roof. “Why am I a <i>minion?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Villains have minions!” the alicorn replied, and after that they were out of earshot.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia blinked at the thoroughly restrained Nightmare Moon. “What on Equestria happened to you?”</p><p class="double">“Mmmff.” Nightmare replied, rolling her eyes towards the rope tying her muzzle shut.</p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry.” With a flash of fire, Celestia incinerated the rope. Nightmare gasped in air.</p><p class="double">“Celestia, sister of mine… why?” Nightmare managed. “Why must you torment me so?”</p><p class="double">“Pardon?” Celestia asked. “This wasn’t me.”</p><p class="double">“It can’t have been coincidence.” Moon said, pointedly. “A thousand years. A <i>thousand</i> years on the moon, I planned my revenge. And when I got here, and announced my arrival to the world, I got halfway through my planned speech and then got body-checked by a great wyrm. It’s just not <i>fair.”</i></p><p class="double">“A great wyrm… hmmm, there aren’t any I can think of.” The Princess of the Sun mused. “Not that would get involved, anyway. And… what’s happening to the sky?”</p><p class="double">“Don’t ask me.” Nightmare Moon finally got a spell off, and dissolved into stars before reforming with the ropes left where they’d been shed. “Is that cloud… rainbow coloured? Did you redecorate while I was gone?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“We have ignition!” Spike said.</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “This is probably a really stupid thing to do, but who cares. We’re the only ones in danger.”</p><p class="double">‘Eternal Twilight’ dumped a last batch of liquid rainbow into the cloud layer, then kicked the pilot cloud into the main cirrostratus.</p><p class="double">There was a huge flash, and when it died down Twilight was short most of her hair and Spike had a singed tail.</p><p class="double">On the other hoof, the cloud layer was merrily burning.</p><p class="double">“Success! Now to go and make my demands to Celestia!” Twilight cackled, getting back into character. “Though I might want to apply a hair regrowth spell first. I look ridiculous.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t you have a magic… thing… with your mane?” Spike waved a claw vaguely. “You know, like Luna and Celestia do?”</p><p class="double">“No, but it might be nice to invent one.” Twilight agreed. “I’ll ask for how they did it next time. Anyway, let’s see…” she checked a list. “Our demands include, but are not limited to… the town of Trottingham except the left half, every first edition book in Equestria, the treasury – with condiments,” she nodded to Spike, “free passes to Ponyville sauna, a cool set of armour for me, and…”</p><p class="double">Spike started whistling.</p><p class="double">“You added this bit, didn’t you?” Twilight asked accusingly. “The dressmaker known as ‘Rarity’ to perform Damsel in Distress duties for one day a month?”</p><p class="double">“You know it’s not a proper horde without a proper horse.” Spike said glibly. “Actually, though… why are we doing this?”</p><p class="double">“It is very funny.” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“No, I mean what are we going to tell them?”</p><p class="double">“Oh. Hadn’t really thought that through.” Twilight admitted. “I suppose that if we can get Celestia and Nightmare Moon to put aside their differences, that’d be nice. But the reason we’ll tell them? Hmmm…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why, Twilight?” Celestia asked, pushing with her magic at Eternal Twilight’s shield. “Why did you become so twisted and dark?”</p><p class="double">“Ahem.” Nightmare Moon interjected, horn blazing right alongside her sister.</p><p class="double">“Sorry.” Celestia apologized. “Force of habit.”</p><p class="double">“That’s alright.” Moon accepted her sister had simply made a slip of the tongue, and kept hammering away at the shield.</p><p class="double">“You weren’t ready for Nightmare Moon’s return!” Eternal Twilight shouted. “Neither of you are fit to rule, and so I decided to take over!”</p><p class="double">“And what about young Spike?” Celestia slammed her hooves on the floor, increasing the intensity of her attack.</p><p class="double">Spykoranuvellitar, standing to one side and taking up most of the Ponyville Square, looked embarrassed. “The pay’s good. She does dental.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon suddenly looked interested. Celestia nudged her. “Stay on-task, sister!”</p><p class="double">“Fine.” Moon grumbled. “<i>Did</i> you have a plan for my return?”</p><p class="double">“You’re looking at her.” Celestia replied. “She seemed like a good fit to use the Element of Magic.”</p><p class="double">Twilight’s shield dropped so suddenly that the two estranged royal sisters’ attack overshot, and demolished the empty library.</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Twilight said, shrinking back into a unicorn. “You could have <i>said</i>. Hey, Spike, go put the clouds out.”</p><p class="double">“Why me?” Spykoranuvellitar asked, crossing his enormous arms.</p><p class="double">“You’re fireproof, and you still have wings.” Twilight replied. “Besides, I need to go rebuild the library.”</p><p class="double">“…that’s <i>it?”</i> Nightmare Moon asked. <i>“Seriously?”</i></p><p class="double">“Shut up and stop complaining!” Celestia hissed. “Do you <i>want</i> to fight her again?”</p><p class="double">“…you have a point.” Moon admitted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Sorry about the misunderstanding. I may have overdone it a bit there. But you have to admit, it would have set my mind at rest a lot more if I’d had the sense you were doing something.</i></p><p class="double"><i>The thing I learned about friendship today is that sometimes ponies who have grudges will team up against a more important enemy, and that that can help them get over the grudges.</i></p><p class="double"><i>P.S. if Spike’s sent most of the desk with this one, that’s because I haven’t managed to undo the growth spell yet.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.3 additional</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The library door creaked open.</p><p class="double">“Oh, who is it- Nightmare!” Twilight said, startled.</p><p class="double">“Please, call me Luna,” the alicorn of darkness said. “My sister and I have discussed things in great detail, and I wish to put the whole sorry affair behind us. No, I was here for a different matter. I heard about this ‘Nightmare Night’. What would be a good costume?”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Why ask me, your highness?” She looked Luna up and down. She actually looked… like she hadn’t changed <i>anything</i> from how she looked when she’d turned up in battle rattle to try and overthrow Celestia.</p><p class="double">“…I don’t actually know many ponies.” Luna said. “It’s only been a few weeks, after all. And you at least know who I am.”</p><p class="double">“True.” Twilight nodded. “Well, you’re ready.”</p><p class="double">“I am?” Luna seemed surprised. “But the holiday is not for months!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but…” Twilight shrugged. “You’re kind of the patron slash scary thing of the holiday. You could go as, er… <i>you.”</i></p><p class="double">“What are you going as, then?” Luna asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “I might actually go as Eternal Twilight. Hmmm… can you encourage your sister to come to Ponyville too? If she dresses up as, I don’t know… Infernal Blaze, or something?”</p><p class="double">“Ah, a theme!” Luna said, enthused. “Much like the costume balls I remember. Yes, I shall enjoin her to do so.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “TREMBLE IN FEAR, MORTALS!” boomed out from a black shape wreathed in stars.</p><p class="double">“THE NIGHT SHALL NOT SAVE YOU NOW!” added a second voice, accompanied by the crackling of flames.</p><p class="double">The light in Ponyville gradually washed out, diffused by fog into a featureless grey. “THERE IS NO HOPE OF DAWN, NO SOLACE OF THE NIGHT.”</p><p class="double">Gradually, almost every pony in the town gravitated to the main square – which the three figures had left alone, preferring to stalk the streets instead.</p><p class="double">Then the front of one of the houses moved. “Boo.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike, Twilight, Celestia and Luna exchanged hoofbumps and high fives.</p><p class="double">“That’s the most fun I’ve had in a century!” Celestia said, still grinning.</p><p class="double">“Indeed, ‘twas most enjoyable.” Luna added, slipping back into archaisms.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Though it might have gone down a bit less well if Spike hadn’t dumped so many sweets into the square – after scaring every pony silly, I mean.”</p><p class="double">“True.” Celestia said. “Now, I wonder how we’re going to top that next year…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “How are we dividin’ this up?” Princess Applejack asked, bodily lifting the newly statue’d Discord into position in what would become the gardens of Canterlot palace. “I mean, ah know Dash did one o’ these loops with you, but…”</p><p class="double">“Hmm…” Princess Twilight Sparkle frowned. “What about if I get the heavens and you get the earth?”</p><p class="double">“Seems t’ work.” Applejack nodded. “Now, what first?”</p><p class="double">“First,” Twilight levitated up a huge stack of books. “I’m afraid we <i>do</i> need to get rather good at paperwork.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, horsefeathers.” Applejack said morosely, and picked up a quill with her telekinesis. “Good thing ah went to that nice school in Manehattan that one time…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Er, Applejack…” Twilight ventured. “You don’t think you might be getting perhaps a little fixated?”</p><p class="double">“What’s that, Twi?” Applejack mumbled, around a mouthful of papers. “Ah’m too busy settin’ up more land grants.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that’s the thing.” Twilight spread out a map with a crackle of paper, and markers appeared. “You’ve dedicated seventy-three percent of the continent to apple production. There was a ‘please, not apples <i>again</i>’ riot in Trottingham!”</p><p class="double">Applejack shrugged. “They’re ingrates, then.”</p><p class="double">“Look… I know you’re in charge of what happens on the ground, but… there <i>are</i> other foods besides apples.” Twilight pressed, feeling a strangely familiar sinking sensation.</p><p class="double">There was a <i>whump</i>, and the yellow-orange alicorn in front of her was consumed by crimson fire. <b>“Say that again, Twilight Sparkle!”</b></p><p class="double"><i>Here we go again…</i> Twilight thought to herself.</p><p class="double">It seemed like the first time one of her friends became one of Equestria’s two rulers, they always overdid <i>something</i>. Twilight was probably quite lucky to have Celestia and Luna to keep an eye on her the first time, actually…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Right.” A sceptical pegasus said to her teacher. “So you want me to go to Ponyville and make sure the sky is clear for that star show thing?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Yes</i>, Dash.” Princess Twilight replied. “And take Spike with you, he needs a bit of exercise. Oh, actually, if you could handle organizing things as well?”</p><p class="double">“Pfeh.” Dash shrugged. “If you want. What do you need?”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Princess Twilight frowned. “I think it’s on the checklist, but I’m particularly concerned about making sure there’s a mage on hand and… make sure the local schoolchildren have their trip to see the display scheduled right, as well. You should find who you need in the notes.”</p><p class="double">“Then I <i>am</i> taking Spike.” Dash said firmly. “No way <i>I’m</i> going to read that much paperwork.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>What do you know,</i> Twilight thought as she teleported into the familiar room of the Sisters’ castle. <i>Loyalty was the crown this time. Neat.</i></p><p class="double">Celestia as an earth pony was a bit stranger, but not by much. Her once-and-future mentor was equally comfortable as all three of the pony breeds, even more so than Luna (who was a unicorn for this particular loop).</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>ah</i> screwed up.” Applejack muttered. “Nice of y’all to keep th’ ecological reforms goin’, though.”</p><p class="double">“Least I could do.” Twilight replied sincerely. “It <i>was</i> amazing work.”</p><p class="double">Then she turned to the Elements for this particular Loop. “Well done, by the way. All of you. Though… Dash, was it really necessary to carry all of them most of the way to the castle?”</p><p class="double">“They were so slow!” Dash complained. “It was driving me nuts!”</p><p class="double">“What did you expect?” Celestia replied. “You’re so good at pegasus magic that you’re taught by <i>Princess Twilight.</i>”</p><p class="double">Celestia was an interesting one, actually. She was the schoolteacher this loop. Cheerilee, meanwhile, was part of the local ecology team.</p><p class="double">It was always interesting, how the Loops shuffled ponies around to fit their talents.</p><p class="double">“Anyway.” Twilight continued. “There’s a harvest festival in a few months, sister. It’s technically in your honour, so… perhaps you could spend it with these fine ponies?”</p><p class="double">Several of the Elements flinched.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy raised a hoof timidly. “Uh… will she let us have foods that aren’t apple based?”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to Applejack.</p><p class="double">“…all right, fine,” the currently-smaller alicorn said. “But this is a big concession on my part.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.5 (Moonstuck)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>You are Princess Twily. You are on the moon for some reason.</i></p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight said, looking around, and noticing that she was much younger than she usually started a loop. “This is new. And <i>by the princesses I am cute</i>!”</p><p class="double"><i>You are overcome by your own cuteness.</i></p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Twilight looked up. “Where did that voice come from?”</p><p class="double"><i>Stop breaking the fourth wall.</i></p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry. Uh… inventory?”</p><p class="double"><i>You have hooves.

She had had to restore her alicorn status just to survive the frozen wasteland, as the weather was the harshest she’d ever seen. She <i>could</i> have allowed her self to die and end the loop for herself, but if the others were here somewhere they would need her help – given that the few times she had tried a spell beyond telekinesis, she’d felt sick as if monsters had tried to climb through her horn into her skull. Besides she owed it to her current companions’ mother to make sure they grew up big and strong first.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hope Twilight&#039;s going to be ok,&quot; she said to the wolves beside her, &quot;Without her magic she gets- twitchy....&quot;</p><p class="double">She trailed of as one of the wolves, a cub a bit larger than her pegasus self, drew her attention to a light flickering in the distance. Lights meant people, hopefully friendly people.</p><p class="double">As they approached she found herself disappointed as all that was there was some sort of pod covered with ice. Scraping the ice of the hatch she gasped as she saw the child within.</p><p class="double">The wolves panted, breath frosting in the air as they looked in at what had surprised their surrogate mother.</p><p class="double">&quot;No! You can&#039;t eat him. We&#039;re going to take this pod to shelter and we&#039;re going to help the poor dear. If no one comes for him you can think of him as your new little brother.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.6 (from Namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, it&#039;s the Summer Sun celebration.” Twilight paced. “How do we deal with Nightmare Moon this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I already took care of it,” Rarity said, smugly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, do we have to worry about ending up in Hogwarts, Eikan, or the Bureau?&quot; Twilight, and most of the others, shuddered at the thought. Rarity, for her part, simply looked indignant.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course not! I’ve been planning this one for several loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash rolled her eyes cynically. &quot;That just means it could blow up worse because you just told us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dashie!” Pinkie tried to look stern, though the giggles ruined the effect. “Don&#039;t be a meanie pants!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it musical? Who&#039;s in it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I went to see Steven Magnet...&quot; Rarity hinted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh-hohohoho! My <i>mustache</i>.

I said Hey!</i>&quot; He brought the princess poltergeist in close.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>What’s goin&#039; on</i>?” Steven then dramatically flung his arms out...sending her flying.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Several Loops later</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Several human loopers looked at each other with varying degrees of shock. Then they looked back at the earnest-looking purple unicorn.</p><p class="double">“Your friends are scary,” someone muttered.</p><p class="double">Ranma smirked. &quot;Okay, who can beat having a villain purified by a Meterosexual British River Serpent&#039;s Singing?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.7 (from Mandemon)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mama!&quot; A way too cheery voice shouted. Twilight grumbled in her sleep. Had one of the Crusaders got into the Library? She merely turned her head instead of waking up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mama!&quot; The voice insisted. Aww, she was having such a good nap, they didn&#039;t make beds like these often.</p><p class="double">&quot;MAMA!&quot; Guess there would be no rest. She slowly opened her eyes and turned to voice the annoying voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it Celes...&quot; Twilight fell silent. In front of her, <i>a filly sized Celestia</i> stood with an incredibly grin on her face, holding a picture. Next to her, equally small and equally smiling Luna was holding her own picture.</p><p class="double">&quot;We made pictures!&quot; Celestia said. Then the memories came. Twilight tried really hard not to show the rising panic on her face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... yes, they are very nice, now let mommy sleep, okay?&quot; she managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww, but you promised we would go see Aunty Pinkie!&quot; Filly Luna pouted. Twilight was not sure whenever she should squee and hug her or be disturbed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, um, we will be. Just, let mommy nap for five more minutes, okay?&quot; She needed it. She needed <i>a lot</i> more time than that, actually, but five minutes was probably all she could get.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay!&quot; Both fillies ran off. Once she was relatively sure they were gone, Twilight cast a silence spell and stuffed her head into the pillow. She really did not need memories of <i>a foal birth</i>.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia and Discord, sitting in a treehouse, <i>kiiiisss-</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;SHUT UP! I don&#039;t have a crush on him!&quot; Celestia shouted at Luna, who was giggling. Twilight was <i>still</i> trying to adjust to the whole idea of suddenly being a parent. To her own mentor, to boot. According to her memories, she had been Chief Librarian of what was known as the Holy United Kingdom of Equestria and Griffin... lead by a several thousand years old <i>Spike</i>. According to those same memories, she had moved to Ponyville to raise her two children.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hey Twilight!&quot; Pinkie shouted. &quot;Dissy! It&#039;s Twilight and the sisters!&quot; A small draconequus looked out the upper floor, before jumping down and turning the land under him into a pillow. He tried to run to the sisters, but Pinkie stopped him. &quot;Dissy, what have I said about turning things and not turning them back?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Never turn anything into different things and not revert them unless it is to help someone or it is very amusing.&quot; Discord said, looking down and holding his hands behind his back. Pinkie nodded happily and gave him a nudge.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, now go play with your friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YAY! Divine Cutie Mark Seekers go!&quot; All three shouted and ran off.</p><p class="double">&quot;That... was disturbing.&quot; Twilight muttered. &quot;So, you&#039;re Discord’s parent?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YUP! He is such a sweety, really! Never cleans his room, but he has his heart in the right place.&quot; Pinkie said. &quot;Oh, and he just loves having fun, just like me!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, while our… children… are looking for their cutie marks,” Twilight paused, and went down a different track, “seriously, can Discord even have one?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know, you&#039;re the one with the big library! I just know he is equally excited as your two little girls!&quot; Pinkie said. Twilight was starting to doubt that Pinkie was even Awake. She was taking all this way too easily.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, we might as well as see what others are doing.&quot; Twilight said, turning around the corner to see the orphanage where – according to her memories – Rarity and Applejack worked. However, before they got there they met Fluttershy, who was trying to hold down a very exited Cadance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please mommy!? Can we go see Shining Armor? Please please please pleaaaaaase!?&quot; Little Cadance was asking, while doing the best puppy eyes impression she could. To her credit, Fluttershy managed to hold out… for about five seconds.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, after we have bought these items, then we can go see Shining.&quot; Fluttershy said meekly. She did have experience with animals, but Cadance was something she had never faced before.</p><p class="double">&quot;YAAAAAAAAAY! Come on Mom! You&#039;re so slow!&quot; The little filly said, jumping up and down, running back and forth the shop and Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Need help?&quot; Twilight asked she and Pinkie walked to her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it&#039;s okay, she’s just eager to see Shining Armor...&quot; Fluttershy began.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ohh! Pinkie Sense says someone has a cruuush~!&quot; Pinkie Pie said, with Candance nodding.</p><p class="double">&quot;YUP! We are going to get married and then we are going to have a big wedding and cakes and a big castle and he is going to be my personal knight and...&quot; Twilight more or less tuned out Cadance’ increasingly rapid fire fantasy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is Shining Armor aware of this... relationship?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think he likes her too, but is afraid other boys will make fun on him because of it...&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;So, where are the Princ.... Celestia and Luna?&quot; She asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ran off with Discord to seek their cutie marks, though seeing how they seem to have kept their powers, I fe-&quot; At that moment, a sudden down pour of orange juice fell on Twilight. Twilight merely looked upwards and saw the three kids, Celestia, Luna and Discord with a rather large bucket.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww, apparently our specialty ain&#039;t pranking...&quot; Discord said.</p><p class="double">&quot;How about farming?&quot; Luna suggested.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, so, we are all here.&quot; Twilight said, looking down at her notes so far. &quot;Spike is an ancient dragon that one day decided he’d grown tired of mortals ruining his day nap and… conquered the continent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t forget the part where he dried out the ocean between Equestria and Griffin Kingdoms, making them a single continent.&quot; Dash said, smirking. &quot;All because one of the griffins dared to poke him.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, that too. Well, looks like he isn&#039;t Awake, and if he is, he isn’t showing it. So, main thing is... we are all parents. In one sense or other.&quot; Twilight said, shaking her head. &quot;I really didn&#039;t need to those memories to begin with.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it ain&#039;t that bad.&quot; Dash said. &quot;At least it&#039;s fun to wat- SOMBRA! STOP PICKING ON YOUR SISTER!&quot; She shouted at the sight of Sombra trying to scare Chrysalis with a bug. Which, seeing that Chrysalis was <i>still</i> a changeling, was kinda weird.</p><p class="double">&quot;But moooom!&quot; The little Sombra said, trying his best puppy eyes impression.</p><p class="double">&quot;No buts! Into the corner!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww...&quot; Grumbling, but still obeying, Sombra walked into the corner and sat down. Chrysalis blew him a raspberry, before noticing the look Dash was giving to her and stopping.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, an orphanage?&quot; Twilight asked Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup. All those little ones, all in need of someone to hold them. Besides, Big Mac is just <i>adorable</i> when he pouts!&quot; Rarity said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Adorable? It&#039;s <i>hilarious</i>!&quot; Applejack said. &quot;I can never take him seriously again! I mean, sure, Granny Smith did hint at it but I never knew he was such a cry baby!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.8 (from Zulaq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Ok,” Princess Twilight Sparkle turned away from the just closed doors to the throne room, “Whose turn is it to go evil and try and take over Equestria now?” she surveyed the nine other alicorns in the room.</p><p class="double">“Oh, oh, me, me!” Princess Pinkie Pie shouted, bouncing up and down, “I have just the idea! I can throw a party! And then another party! And then another! And get this, all those parties will be part of my plan to TAKE OVER THE WORLD! Or they would be if it weren’t for the fact that I’d rather party than actually rule. I wonder if that takes me out of contention?”</p><p class="double">“Darling, I don’t really think you can use parties to take over the world,” Princess Rarity said somewhat haughtily.</p><p class="double">“She can,” Twilight replied flatly, before shuddering slightly “And you don’t want to know the details.”</p><p class="double">“Whose stupid idea was it to alternate who goes evil, and who gets to be a mentor to a new hero anyway?” Princess Rainbow Dash asked.</p><p class="double">“Yours Dash. I think you said something about not wanting to spend a thousand years trapped on the moon and not being able to take a nap, again.” Twilight explained somewhat tiredly, “And seeing as there are ten of us alicorns now,” she gestured to the others who hadn’t spoken yet, those being Princesses Luna, Celestia, Applejack, Cadence, Fluttershy, and the sole male among them, Prince Shining Armor. “We thought it would be fair if we each took 100 years, rather than any of us spending a full thousand on the moon.”</p><p class="double">“Well this stinks,” Rainbow said, “I mean just look at what some of you guys have done,” she turns to Princess Applejack, “I mean seriously, Hard Truth? Couldn’t you come up with a better name for yourself? It was kina’ hard for me to keep a straight face when I told Spirit Wind about you.”</p><p class="double">“Now wait one doggon minute!” Princess Applejack countered Rainbow Dash, “Danger Dash wasn’t even dangerous. You just pranked the country enough that people were practically on all four knees begging us to stop you!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, well that’s better than simply making everypony tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth!” Dash argued.</p><p class="double">“Now ladies,” Princess Celestia interrupted, “I’m sure that you know that the truth can be a beautiful and terrible thing.”</p><p class="double">“Dids’t thou just quote Albus Dumbledore?” Princess Luna inquired of her sister incredulously, “Really?”</p><p class="double">“Oh come on, stop arguing,” Twilight interjected, “It’s getting us nowhere, and besides we already have a schedule written up, and it’s-“</p><p class="double">“My turn, little sis.” Prince Shining Armor broke in with a grin, “I can’t wait.”</p><p class="double">“What are you smiling about, Shining?” Princess Cadence asked her husband, “It means that we won’t be able to see each other for a century!”</p><p class="double">“Two words darling.” Shining said with an even bigger grin, “Makeup sex.”</p><p class="double">“Ohhh.” Cadence said, her eyes glowing a bit. Her voice dropped a bit and became husky, “I can’t wait. We can do that thing using those pirate outfits you think I haven’t noticed.”</p><p class="double">“Gah!” Twilight practically screamed, bringing her hooves up to her eyes, “I didn’t need that mental image of my brother!”</p><p class="double">“Well it’s a good thing you’re not married to him isn’t it, little sister.” Cadence said cheerfully, before turning back to Shining, “So what’s your plan for going evil?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I was thinking about something along the lines of kidnapping a certain princess.” Shining said with a lecherous grin, “and holding her hostage until the other Princesses agree that I become the sole ruler of Equestria!”</p><p class="double">“So when do you want to start?” asked Celestia.</p><p class="double">“Right now!” With that Prince Shining Armor leaped up, used his magic to levitate Princess Cadence and leapt out of the adjoining balcony, “Catch me if you caaan!” He shouted on his way out.</p><p class="double">The remaining eight princesses just stared after him in silence before Princess Fluttershy asked, “So, maybe we should go after them?”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash just looks at Fluttershy askew, “Seriously? I think we’ll need to give them a bit of time to ‘cool off’ first. Maybe a decade or two will do.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Ok, so who’s left?” Princess Twilight Sparkle asked of her fellow co-rulers of Equestria, “We’ve had Nightmare Moon attempt to make an eternal night.”</p><p class="double">At the mention of Nightmare Moon, Princess Luna perked up, “We have had much time to practice our detransformation, but that was the first time we’ve ever repeated the transformation. I daresay we outdid ourself.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah,” Princess Rainbow Dash waved her hooves, “I don’t get what was so special about turning the moon to cheese, or that thing about ‘Night Eternal’ is the only way you could get it to age properly.”</p><p class="double">“Thou simply hast no sense of taste.” Luna scoffed, “It was the finest brie ever made.”</p><p class="double">“It was!” Princess Pinkie Pie interjected, “It was just perfect for all those parties I threw as Party Pink!”</p><p class="double">“That was a lot of parties, darling.” Princess Rarity sighed, “I daresay I probably put on more than a few pounds at them.”</p><p class="double">“A few pounds!” Princess Applejack said, laughing, before making a gesture with her hooves as far apart as she could make them, “I think you were about this big by the time you realized. And then you singlehoofedly beat her and banished her to the moon. Or at least what was left of it after Pinkie finished carving it up for parties.”</p><p class="double">Princess Rarity looked like she was about to start a big argument with Applejack, but Twilight stepped in before the two mares could really get going, “Moving on. After Party Pink, we had Blazing Sun. I have to say you did an excellent job with that Celestia.”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia blushed a bit, “It wasn’t much. I’ve had a lot watching Lulu do it, so I just sort of copied her actions a bit.” She turned to Princess Luna, “Although I am sorry about your cheese.”</p><p class="double">Princess Luna looked rather downbeat, “It took over two hundred years for it to get just ripe enough. And then thou melted it!” And with that she began crying.</p><p class="double">“There, there,” Princess Fluttershy reassured her, “At least it made the moon round again after Pinkie’s parties.”</p><p class="double">“But all that cheese, Wasted!” Luna wailed, “And that cute little cottage cheese cottage we made for us to stay in was completely gone. And what was left was burnt!”</p><p class="double">“Uh, moving on again,” Twilight interjected in-between Luna’s wailing about dead cheese, “After that we had Danger Dash, who pranked people until they could be pranked no more.”</p><p class="double">“Eh, the old fall back was good enough for me,” Princess Rainbow Dash said, “It worked the first time, and I moderated myself a bit so the elements would let me sleep this time.” She paused a bit, before running a hoof along her wings, “Although getting all that goopy, melted cheese off of my wings was a bit of a pain.”</p><p class="double">“After Danger Dash, we had me, Eternal Twilight.” Twilight said proudly.</p><p class="double">“Meh,” Rainbow Dash yawned, “You didn’t really do that much. I mean your whole plan revolved around owning a copy of every book ever written, and then enslaving everypony in your library paradise. Where was the action! The excitement! I mean you even made sure to treat your slaves well; I think the worst thing that happened to them was a papercut.”</p><p class="double">“Well it’s not exactly efficient to work them to death.” Twilight defended herself, “Do you have any idea how hard it is to train someone to work in a library properly?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, Twily,” Prince Shining Armor put in. “I mean, the only reason why we had to banish you was because you wanted to expand your library to the whole castle. Not exactly threatening.”</p><p class="double">“Oh really,” Twilight said, her eyes narrowing, “And what about you. You turned into Dashing Armor, then you kidnapped Cadence.”</p><p class="double">“And?”</p><p class="double">“And there is no ‘and’. You kidnapped her, and then the two of you took a century long second honeymoon! At no point did we have to send you to the moon. Do you know how embarrassing it was to explain to my student that she had to go get my brother and sister-in-law because they let their second honeymoon go on too long, and we really, really needed them back at the court?”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused, and gathered her thoughts for a moment, “Anyway, moving on, again. After that we had Hard Truth. I must say, I didn’t really think making everypony tell the truth all the time was much of an evil plan, but… you made it work, Applejack.”</p><p class="double">“Shucks, It weren’t nothin’” Princess Applejack blushed, “Nopony knows more than me how the truth can make or break a relationship.”</p><p class="double">“Ok, and after that we had Loving Evening,” at this Twilight drooped a bit, “whose plan consisted of kidnapping Shining Armor, and going on your third honeymoon. Seriously, Cadence?”</p><p class="double">Princess Cadence blushed a bit, “Well when a pony has an itch, she wants it taken care of.” She looked at Shining Armor, and her blush deepened. “And I daresay that I have the best way to relive it, ever.”</p><p class="double">“Please, spare me the details,” Twilight said dryly, “And after that we had The Fasionista! (exclamation mark included), who forced everypony to wear fashionable clothes, whether they wanted to or not.”</p><p class="double">“Oh darling, The Fashionista! was my most brilliant idea ever.” Rarity gushed with a glow in her eyes, “If it weren’t for Rainbow Dash I’d never have had to have seen somepony wearing anything out of fashion ever again!” She let out a somewhat disturbing laugh, and the other nine alicorns moved away from her nervously.</p><p class="double">“And now it’s Fluttershy’s turn” Twilight said once she’d recovered, “So-“</p><p class="double">“Wait a moment!” Rainbow Dash interrupted, “I don’t think this is a good idea Twi.”</p><p class="double">“Nonsense,” Twilight dismissed her, “We all agreed in the beginning we’d take turns being the villain, and now it’s Fluttershy’s turn.”</p><p class="double">“I hate to say it,” Applejack interjected, “But I agree with Dashie. You haven’t forgotten that incident with Iron Will, have you?”</p><p class="double">“Oh come on. What could go wrong?” Twilight said blithely, overriding her friends’ concerns, “It’s Fluttershy’s turn, and that’s all there is too it.”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Princess Fluttershy said quietly, “I guess, if you think it’s alright.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy seemed to compose herself, before her eyes flashed red and she turned to Twilight Sparkle. She spoke, her mouth containing far too many, and far too pointed teeth for a normal pony, “I AM FLYING HATRED. AND YOU ALL WILL BOW BEFORE ME! ALL SHALL LOVE ME AND DESPAIR!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.9 (from DrTempo) (Metal Gear Solid universe)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike shook his claw in pain.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why won&#039;t you die?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike had enjoyed this loop. Not every day he was a badass cyborg… Though the beginning where he was a whiny rookie on the Big Shell bothered him. Man, that whole ending had given him a MASSIVE headache.</p><p class="double">And now, he was fighting Blueblood…or his counterpart, anyway. And he wouldn&#039;t stay down!</p><p class="double">Cue Blueblood tearing off his shirt.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nanomachines, son!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike shook his head at this. &quot;Forget this.&quot; He drew a lightsaber, and went to town on Blueblood.</p><p class="double">&quot;Protect yourself from THIS.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">At Mission Control, Twilight shook her head. “And he was doing so well… right, how do I explain away a lightsaber.” After a moment, she answered her own question. “Of course. Nanomachines. Silly me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Blueblood went down, deader than dead, Spike smirked. He&#039;d enjoyed cutting that jerk up like a Hearth&#039;s Warming turkey. Then Blade Wolf arrived, carrying the Murasama.</p><p class="double">His jaw dropped. &quot;Oh. Why did you need this thing again?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.10 (Namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked at her friends in the library. &quot;So what&#039;s our plan for this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity chuckled. &quot;Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and I think we&#039;ll take a vacation for this loop. What about you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack chuckled, &quot;Well, after hearing Sheppard&#039;s music, I think I’ll turn Big Macintosh into a Country Music Singer.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie smiled, before turning into Pinkamena Diane Pie, causing her friends to flinch...before noticing that the expression was the same Pinkie. &quot;I&#039;m also going to take a vacation.&quot; Fluttershy opened her mouth, before being cut off by Pinkie. &quot;While looking like this, just to see how people react.&quot; </p><p class="double">Rainbow rustled her wings slightly. &quot;So what will you be up to Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m thinking of trying something with Zecora.&quot; She levitated a familiar book in front of herself.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Five of the loopers looked at the coronation of a new Alicorn in shock. Twilight looked slightly smug. </p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I think this settles the question of how similar zebras are to ponies, wouldn&#039;t you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">It was sort of a pity that Zecora wasn’t looping, actually, because that meant the ascension was for this loop only. But it was an interesting proof of concept.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.11 (Mandemon)</p><p class="double">(This one came from a typo which misspelt Sombra.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You have to be kidding me.&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cryyyyysssstaaaallls... heaaaaaarts...&quot; A drooling Crystal Pony was walking towards Twilight and her friends, who were not awake in this loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Unfortunately, Zonpies created by Zombra tend to be like this.&quot; Candance said, blasting one of the infected ponies. &quot;They spread the infection by biting you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you want us to go into the deepest pit of their lair, to find the source of the infection?&quot; Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what? Buck it.&quot; Twilight said, and turned into an alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;WHOA NELLY!&quot; Applejack jumped a foot into the air. The others were a little better able to control their shock, but not much.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s see... how did Nanoha do it again... Oh right!” Twilight planted her hoof with a <i>crack</i>. “STARLIGHT BREAKER!&quot;</p><p class="double">A massive beam hit the castle, tearing through the walls and mindlessly shambling infected Zonpies. In the middle of the hive, a mass of flesh and crystals opened one of its many eyes to see a bright light approaching. Funnily enough, its last thought was &quot;Not again.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.12 (Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: this loop was previously posted incomplete.

Honestly, given how bad the loop ended he was surprised he wasn&#039;t on Eiken. <i>&#039;Then again, better lose a G-Stone and a Death Star than deal personally with Kei and Yuri when Awake…&#039;</i>, Ranma shuddered at the thought of what could have happened again.</p><p class="double">Then there was his body: a dark blue-colored small horse. While it wasn&#039;t the strangest body Ranma has inhabited, having replaced the bodiless Voldemort a few times, the lack of fingers felt just plain weird. Though… he didn&#039;t seem to stand out, in this population of small horses as colorful as the rainbow. It actually made him remember Nanoha&#039;s tale of a certain unicorn, a new anchor, she met some time ago. Probably he was in the unicorn&#039;s loop.</p><p class="double">Apparently his name here was Rapid Hooves and the town he was in was named Ponyville, a nice enough place at first glance, <i>&#039;though with my luck I can only hope it stays like that&#039;</i>. Still, better be careful: learn the ropes now to play pranks later.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; an acute shriek filled the air. When Ranma looked at the direction he saw a cloud of smoke going into his way, whose cause was apparently a bright pink colored horse with a cotton candy-like mane, probably a she.</p><p class="double">The mare rounded Ranma a few times looking at him carefully while his sense of panic started to fire like crazy and he finally realized three things: first, he was definitely a stallion here; second, he didn&#039;t remember seeing any males; and third, he was naked. <i>&#039;Why I always have to get the crazy ones?’</i> To his surprise though, the crazy pink mare just stopped, looked at him in the eye and began running in another random direction.</p><p class="double">That was strange.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight! Twilight!&quot; The pink earth pony jumped by Twilight Sparkle&#039;s side.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s up Pinkie Pie?&quot; The unicorn kept reading her book.</p><p class="double">&quot;I met a new pony today!&quot; That made Twilight stop reading. She knew Pinkie Pie knew everypony who lived in Ponyville from her custom to launch &quot;Welcome to Ponyville&quot; parties, and then even extended to Equestria since the loop the Pincesses asked Pinkie Pie to make a census of Equestria&#039;s pony population. To have Pinkie Pie meet somepony she had never met before it was very strange. <i>&#039;Unless...&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;How does this new pony look?&quot; On this question Pinkie Pie started to jump again, even more quickly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Oh! Oh! I know that one! Let me see... he was an earth pony who had two eyes, two forelegs, two hindlegs and a mane. Also he was dark blue in color and had his mane in a black braid.&quot; That solved a few things, she didn&#039;t remember an earth pony with a braid other than Applejack. &quot;Oh! and I also found him by following the most strange doozy: left ear three round right, right ear two rounds left and four pulls from my tail.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned a little. &quot;That&#039;s a new Pinkie Sense, what does that mean?&quot; One of there loops she had to understand how that worked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure, but I&#039;ve only felt it once before, when we met Hiccup and you weren&#039;t around.&quot; Pinkie tried to show how big Hiccup&#039;s dragon had been.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;That loop? Then that means...&#039;</i> &quot;Ok Pinkie, you win. Looks like you&#039;ll host your first &#039;Welcome to Equestria&#039;s Loop&#039; party. I want to inform the Princesses though, they are awake this time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okie dokie lokie! I&#039;ll prepare my Party Cannon Mk. pi for this new friend!&quot; Pinkie said, putting her right hoof in a salute.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle put a leaf inside the book to continue reading it later &quot;All right Pinkie. By the way, what&#039;s his-&quot; but by the time Twilight looked again at her friend Pinkie had already left &quot;- name?&quot;. Ok, never mind. Better find Spike, she had a letter to send.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I send this letter to tell you information of great importance. Not five minutes ago I received a visit from Pinkie Pie to tell me she found a pony she has never meet before, who she believes is actually a looper. As such Pinkie decided to throw him a &#039;Welcome to Equestria&#039; party.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Since Pinkie Pie is already making preparations for the party I believe it will start within the hour. Should you and Princess Luna wish to attend it I think you should teleport directly into Ponyville Library.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m sorry to send this letter so little time beforehoof but Pinkie Pie was very enthusiastic to throw the party quickly. Nevertheless, I have great hopes in Pinkie Pie and everypony to make this party a success, both as a student of the Magic of Friendship and as Equestria&#039;s Anchor.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your faithful student,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Twilight Sparkle</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and send it, Spike.&quot;</p><p class="double">The child dragon looked at the scroll suspiciously &quot;Looper? Anchor? You aren&#039;t making any sense, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn just threw him an apologetic look &quot;Sorry, I&#039;ll explain later. Please just go along for now, OK?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine,&quot; and with a burst of flame Spike sent the now rolled letter to the Princess. &quot;Letter on its way. Now what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now we find the girls. Let&#039;s meet at the Library in half an hour.&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">Hearing that, Spike started to run. &quot;I&#039;ll go to Carrousel Boutique first! See you later, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle just smiled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ranma looked around for the voice who was calling him, but saw nobody.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, you, new pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">Well, if there&#039;s nobody around there must be -¬¬ <i>&#039;Up there!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;At last! You&#039;d swear nopony ever looks up.&quot; That was a light blue horse, apparently standing in the cloud looking down on him.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t remember seeing you around here, and Pinkie Pie said she had met somepony new today.&quot; And apparently he was wrong, as when flying down the cloud he realized the horse was actually a pegasus, a pegasus whose mane was literally as colorful as the rainbow.</p><p class="double">The pegasus grinned &quot;I&#039;m Rainbow Dash, the coolest and fastest pegasus of all Equestria and local weather manager. Your name?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ran-pid Hooves. I just arrived here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked at Ranma as if measuring him. &quot;Rapid Hooves, huh? So, how fast do you are?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Never really pushed myself, but I think I can do pretty good.&quot; Technically true. After all he had just found himself in this body.</p><p class="double">&quot;But not as fast as me.&quot; For Ranma the feeling of a yet-untold challenge from a stranger met just by walking around was... nostalgic.</p><p class="double">Not being one to stand down, Ranma upped the ante. &quot;You&#039;d think, but you&#039;re the fastest pegasus only because I don&#039;t have wings.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right Rapid Hooves, it&#039;s on! See the tree by the end of the street? That&#039;s Twilight&#039;s house, the first pony to enter the house wins.&quot;</p><p class="double">Why not? After all a bit of a run may help to understand this new body. &quot;Just say the word, Rainbow Dash. And prepare to lose.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;At the count of three. One, two, three!&quot; And then they started.</p><p class="double">In the end Ranma wasn&#039;t sure who won the race as he got entangled with Rainbow Dash to enter through the designed-for-one-horse door. He knew neither he nor Rainbow was going as fast as they could, though, and he suspected the pegasus also knew it. Overall, the body may need a little time to get used to but he had the whole loop for that. Still, he’d miss having fingers.</p><p class="double">Now that he thought about it, it was strange… the door was opened yet it was dark inside--</p><p class="double">*click* &quot;SURPRISE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ranma looked around to what looked like a surprise party: balloons, confetti, foods, drinks and some cake on tables... for the pegasus perhaps? It wasn’t like he knew anybody yet in this world. Until he looked at a giant banner over the horses and unicorns.</p><p class="double"><b>Welcome to Equestria&#039;s Loop.</b></p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s him, right? The looper you found, Pinkie Pie.&quot; Rainbow Dash called to the crazy pink mare from a while before.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Rainbow!&quot; Pinkie looked even more like she was in a sugar rush. She took Ranma&#039;s equivalent to right hand into of her forelegs and shook them energetically. &quot;Hi, I&#039;m Pinkie Pie. What&#039;s your name? How long have you been on Equestria? What is your world called? Do you like cake? Everypony I know loves cake, and that&#039;s one of the reasons I love to work in Sugarcube Corner here and why I want to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie! Let him stand up.&quot; A purple unicorn interrupted Pinkie Pie. Thankfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops, sorry.&quot; Said the pink horse... pony? Before letting go of Ranma.</p><p class="double">After standing up, the looping male pony asked the group &quot;So, let me this straight. All of you are Awake right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Except Spike here, yes.&quot; The purple unicorn pointed to the little lizard by her side.</p><p class="double">&quot;And she found me and realized I was also a looper.&quot; Ranma asked pointing to Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot; The unicorn answered again. You&#039;d expect one of the bigger unicorns in the back might be better choices to play spokesperson.</p><p class="double">&quot;And then you decided to throw a welcome party for me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually the party was Pinkie Pie&#039;s idea.&quot; The unicorn said while pointed to the pink mare.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wasn&#039;t going to let the chance to throw a &#039;Welcome to Ponyville&#039; party go, but in your case you were new to Equestria so the other banner wouldn&#039;t work here; to think I&#039;d have the chance to make a welcome party for somepony from another world... I think I&#039;d have used few more star-pattered balloons because stars and worlds are so close but I couldn&#039;t find them, and then I decided on starfish but I realized &#039;aren&#039;t we too far from the sea to get starfish?&#039; so I threw away the idea and decided to go with the multicolor balloons...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, just one question: how did you realize I was a looper too?&quot; Ranma asked, stopping Pinkie Pie&#039;s rambling once again.</p><p class="double">&quot;But that’s obvious, because I know everypony who lives in Equestria.&quot; Wait, just like that?</p><p class="double">&quot;Everyone everyone?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, everpony.&quot; The others don&#039;t seem to be surprised by the answer… so it was probably true.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I think I&#039;ll take your word from it. Better start with introductions: my name here is Rapid Hooves, but you can imagine that isn&#039;t my real name because I&#039;m looping too. My real name is Ranma Saotome.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?! The first anchor?!&quot; The purple unicorn was about to start talking excitedly when a single word stopped her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight...&quot; From one of the bigger unicorns in the back, the white one... they also have wings too, so pegacorn.</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn flinched before throwing her a short apologetic look and returning to business. &quot;Oh yes, sorry Princess. My name is Twilight Sparkle. I&#039;m Equestria&#039;s Anchor and my friends here are the other loopers from this world...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the end, Twilight Sparkle <i>was</i> the unicorn anchor who had met Nanoha. She introduced herself as the local librarian and calling herself a student of &quot;the Magic of Friendship.&quot; <i>&#039;No wonder Nanoha seemed to like her&#039;</i>. The party itself had gone without incident other than some spontaneous firing of cannons from Pinkie Pie. Oddly, it happened to use a table with tablecloth, a punch bowl, glasses and snacks as ammunition... a trick to learn later.</p><p class="double">Now there was time to meet the Princesses, something Ranma was a bit wary of. Apparently they had to make the party private so nobody realized they were here.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, do you have any plans for this loop?&quot; Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really, Your Highness&quot; Better be polite with royalty, they always know how to screw with you.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess, please.&quot; The Sun Princess corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right. Well, Princess, I just started this loop and I was actually thinking of going and learning how things worked in this world.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can see that, there are many things that are better to learn first hoof. But please, if you have anything you&#039;d like, big or small, don&#039;t be afraid to ask Twilight Sparkle. We are in constant communication.&quot; As on cue Spike appeared and burned a rolled scroll, which vanished and appeared right in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Princess...&quot; why did his weakness have to be women? &quot;…in my own experience, most rulers who are as generous as you claim to be always have something <i>you</i> do for <i>them</i>.&quot; Even a Seto Kamiki Jurai, hopefully still non-looping, can be a pain after she got her sights on you.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, but there is one little thing you can do for me...&quot; Celestia told Ranma, closing her eyes with a predatory grin, and Ranma felt the blood draining from his face. Looked like Equestria won&#039;t be the safe haven he thought it would be.</p><p class="double">&quot;W-hat is it P-princess?&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia opened her eyes as if she was a child entering a sweet shop. &quot;Stories of your previous loops, of course!&quot;</p><p class="double">Huh?!</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s composed yet cheerful tone continued &quot;According to Twilight Sparkle, Equestria&#039;s loop is relatively new in relation to other worlds, and I&#039;m even not Awake as often as I want! Twilight has told me about other places but I&#039;ve been out of Equestria only a few times. But sadly we have an important mission here in Equestria, as I raise the Sun every day and my sister raises the Moon every night.</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand that by your looper standards I&#039;m just a filly so I want to know what happens. This is the most interesting development we&#039;ve had in centuries, and I want to help them,&quot; Celestia pointed to the other ponies in the room, &quot;as much as I can.&quot;</p><p class="double">Internally Ranma sighed in relief. <i>&#039;For one moment I thought the mares were going to-&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;But there&#039;s also another reason.&quot; Celestia told him when the dark blue pegacorn... alicorn walked to her side, Princess Luna, both hardening their expressions and shifting their positions into a more regal one.</p><p class="double">&quot;Even before the loops started my sister Luna and I have ruled Equestria for over a millenia, and we are proud to believe in its founding principles: Harmony and the Magic of Friendship. We believe in friendship and redemption, in always working together so the next day, even if that day is in the past, is better than today, and in always have a place to call home and return.&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Luna continued where her sister left off &quot;And &#039;tis with conviction and knowledge, true and certain in equal measure, that a soul may become heavy in the course of long life; that we, the Diarchs of Equestria, offer you, Ranma Saotome, together with any other Looper willing to accept, be they pony in form or no, our fair land as a place of sanctuary and respite from the wearying travel &#039;twixt worlds and loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ranma was dimly aware that the other ponies bowed to the Princesses while he weighted what he was <i>really</i> being offered.</p><p class="double">After coming to a decision, Ranma sighed heavily, stood tall in front of the Princesses and nodded with a smile in his face. &quot;Sure, let&#039;s give it a shot.&quot; Who knows, it may even work for some time after all. They all seem to be a nice enough group.</p><p class="double">He <i>was</i> going to miss having fingers though.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">7.13 (Rufus Shinra and Lord of Bones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Celly,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Got over the Eternal Night thing.

The sun’s going down in a few minutes.”</p><p class="double">Still no reply. Celestia opened the door and peered in. “Are you sleeping in ag-aaaah!”</p><p class="double">“What?” the jet-black alicorn inside asked, her slit green eyes blinking in the sudden light. “Oh, Our apologies. We forgot to set Our alarm.”</p><p class="double">“Nightmare Moon!” Celestia said, getting over her shock and lighting her horn.</p><p class="double">“Yes, We know We have slept in, Infernal Blaze.” Nightmare Moon… rolled over out of bed and started getting dressed.</p><p class="double">Celestia’s spell collapsed, as she tried to work out what the <i>her</i> was going on.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Twilight!” Celestia said, teleporting into the Books and Branches library. “Nightmare Moon is back!”</p><p class="double">“So?” her students’ voice said from behind her. “It <i>is</i> the evening. That’s her job.”</p><p class="double">Celestia turned to the voice, and saw her student… with an aura of dim light around her, a pair of wings, and her eyes blazing with an internal fire.</p><p class="double">Spike was standing next to her. Or, more <i>lying</i> next to her. That was because he was fifteen feet long, matte black and possessed of both a wide, salamander-esque mouth and huge wings.</p><p class="double">Celestia stared for a moment more, then ran out the door.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “<i>Five</i> of them.” Celestia said to herself. “How could this have happened?”</p><p class="double">It had been bad enough when the two other Elements of Harmony in town had also turned out to be alicorns – their coats with the unnatural colouration of corruption. Worse still were the huge fangs of whatever sweet Fluttershy had become, and the crimson fires coursing over Applejack’s body.</p><p class="double">The fact that they were still doing their daily routines was just <i>weird.</i></p><p class="double">She was distracted by a flash of blue. “Wait!” she called, hoping it was who she thought it was.</p><p class="double">A moment later, Rainbow Dash came back down to land in front of her. Mercifully, the pegasus was unchanged.</p><p class="double">“Thank goodness. I have terrible news, Rainbow Dash. All the other Elements are-”</p><p class="double">There was a loud BANG, and she jumped at the shock.</p><p class="double">“Hah!” Dash shouted. “Got you! The old firecracker trick!” As she spoke, she <i>shifted</i>. Her mane grew more vibrant, then got pushed aside by a horn. She gained an extra few inches, and her eyes flashed with fire. As an afterthought, she added “Oh, and it’s Danger Dash, by the way. Well, so long, I have to go deliver some rain.”</p><p class="double">Celestia sat back on her haunches, flabbergasted. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Well?” Dash asked, crowding around the table where the other Elements, Spike and Luna were already sitting.</p><p class="double">“I think it worked.” Twilight replied, grinning. “She’s boarded up her room and says she won’t come out until things start making sense.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>8.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, this sucks.” An earth pony with a pink mane kicked at the moon’s surface. “Looks like they weren’t lying…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The remaining two ponies from that group stared at the Elements of Harmony.</p><p class="double">“…really?” the orange pegasus asked, like someone who had given up all hope and who was now seeing a chance again.</p><p class="double">“Hn.” The black unicorn from the group put in. “Nice to see <i>someone</i> can control Sakura.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed, as she and the other five Elements powered down. “Thank you. But we said this was a safe Loop, and we <i>meant</i> it.”</p><p class="double">The orange pegasus beat the air with his wings and took off. “I’m going to go spend the entire loop doing something nice and safe. Like sculpting. Clouds. Later, Sasuke!”</p><p class="double">Sasuke considered. “Yeah, I agree with Naruto. Any calm, safe, boring things we could do?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy hummed. “Your speciality is… lightning, I think?” Sasuke nodded. “Then perhaps you could do transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. You know, little electrical shocks to help with therapy.”</p><p class="double">“…that doesn’t sound that bad, actually.” Sasuke said. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.2</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash Awoke, and saw Fluttershy falling in front of her. The pegasus paused, taking a fraction of a second to check the others via her link to Loyalty.</p><p class="double">All six of them were here, and Awake.</p><p class="double"><i>Excellent.</i></p><p class="double">She dove into a stoop, wings whirring. “I’m coming, Fluttershy!”</p><p class="double">They’d discussed what to do next time this particular variant loop came up…</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash hit mach one, broke the sound barrier, and was engulfed in a flash of prismatic light. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked determinedly at the egg. <i>Right.</i></p><p class="double">The first time, it had taken the boost from the Rainboom to hatch Spike. The second time… it had been easier.</p><p class="double">The third time, Twilight poured as much magic as she could muster into the egg. There was a crackling <i>boom</i>, and half the wall was pushed aside by Spike’s body as he exploded from egg to young adult dragon in an instant.</p><p class="double">Twilight wobbled on her hooves. “Ooh… I don’t feel so well…” and fell backwards. “Wow… hey, cool. Look, Mum, Dad! I’ve got wings!” She fluttered them. “They’re pretty!”</p><p class="double">Twilight Twinkle and Night Light exchanged a look. The look spoke eloquently of the need for alcohol.</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia galloped into the room. “What happened? I heard the wall collapse-” she saw the dragon trying to extract himself gently from the wall, and the filly alicorn in front of the hole, and her brain went blank. “Huh.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, wow!” Twilight said, stumbling back to her feet. “Princess Celestia!” She gave a bow. “It’s nice to meet you, your highness.”</p><p class="double">“…yes. Nice to meet you.” Celestia managed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Are you okay?” Gilda asked, backwinging hard to land next to the tangle of pegasi. “Dash? That was awesome, but I hope you managed to slow down…”</p><p class="double">A blue wing twitched feebly, then Fluttershy extricated herself from Rainbow Dash and started to help her get back on her feet. “Um… thank you, Dash. For saving me.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah…” Dash muttered, rubbing her forehead. “I wish those butterflies had slowed us down more, though… at least I cushioned you.”</p><p class="double">Now that her friend was clearly out of danger, Gilda relaxed. “That <i>was</i> cool, like I said. You broke the flippin’ <i>sound barrier</i>, Dash! I – wait, what’s that on your forehead?”</p><p class="double">“Huh?” Dash reached up and felt it. When her hair moved aside, it was clearly a short horn – like one might find on a unicorn.</p><p class="double">Gilda boggled. “You been hidin’ things, Dash?”</p><p class="double">“No, this is new.” Dash said, sounding bewildered. “And I – hey, Flutters! You’ve got your cutie mark!”</p><p class="double">“So have you.” Fluttershy said.</p><p class="double">“And <i>you’ve</i> got a horn too, what was it - Fluttershy?” Gilda looked completely lost. “Is that something that happens to <i>all</i> you pegasus ponies? Or just the ones that hit the ground after a rainboom?”</p><p class="double">“Hay if I know.” Dash wobbled on her feet slightly, steadied, and gave her wings an experimental flap. “Okay, I think I can fly now. Let’s go back up there.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Mum! Dad!” Rarity shouted. “Look what I made!”</p><p class="double">“Wow!” Rarity’s mother said, looking at the dress Rarity hovered up for her. “That’s very impressive. What’s it made of?”</p><p class="double">“Water.” Rarity replied. “I did magic on it.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, and did you do the same for the costume you’re wearing?” her father said. “Did you do magic on that too? You’ve worked very fast. I guess we found your special talent.”</p><p class="double">Rarity inclined her head. “Nah, these aren’t a costume.” Her parents’ eyes widened as she spread the wings they’d thought were fake, and hovered up to eye level. “They just came from somewhere. Is this one of those things you said you’d explain when I was older, like where my sister came from?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Huh.” Clyde said, watching as his daughter took to the air and began casting spells. “I ain’t as surprised as I might be.”</p><p class="double">“She always did have her head in the clouds,” his wife nodded.</p><p class="double">“Oh, you.” Clyde gave her a look.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Valencia Orange jumped as Applejack materialized next to her in a flash of orange magic. “Hi, Auntie! Fer some reason ah got a horn an’ wings, an’ so ah’m going to commute!”</p><p class="double">“…what?” Valencia said, her urbane nature completely deserting her.</p><p class="double">“Well, ah saw this big flash o’ light in the sky as ah was decidin’ to go back to Sweet Apple Acres, and then ah got my cutie mark,” she showed it off to the staggered mare, “And then ah just… found ah had wings. And a horn.”</p><p class="double">Applejack shrugged, bouncing around. “Ah don’t know where they came from, but ah worked out how t’ teleport easy! So, anyway, ah can come over here whenever ah feel like it! Ah don’t have t’ choose!”</p><p class="double">“…okay.” Valencia managed. “Hold on a minute, Applejack, I have to go and… calm my nerves.”</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. “Okay!” </p><p class="double"><i>Wonder if she’s going to have a brandy…</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Right.” Celestia said, looking slightly awkwardly over the half-dozen alicorn fillies sitting in front of her. “I don’t know why, but all six of you became alicorns at more-or-less the same time last week. I realize you might be having some trouble fitting in with your peers after… what happened,” that was probably a considerable understatement, “and so I’ve asked someone else who has also been through something like this to help you through it. Any of you can speak to her if you have trouble, over anything – not just what is related directly to your transformation.”</p><p class="double">Celestia gestured. “Cadence, if you would.”</p><p class="double">The eighth and last alicorn in the room stepped forward. “Hello. My name is Cadence, and I used to be a pegasus until about two years ago. It’s nice to meet you all.”</p><p class="double">“Hello, Cadence.” Five fillies chorused.</p><p class="double">Twilight, meanwhile, was sniggering. “I know you! You’re my foalsitter. And my brother has a photo of you that he keeps trying to hide from me!”</p><p class="double">Cadence flushed, and the rest of the fillies started giggling as well.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Well, this seems to be working out well.” Rarity said, sipping some juice.</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Pinkie agreed. “This is the earliest we’ve ever been introduced to each other!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.3 (continuation of 7.14)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Princess?” Twilight’s voice asked.</p><p class="double">Celestia mumbled something from beneath her pillow.</p><p class="double">“We’d like to come in and apologize.”</p><p class="double">Celestia thought it over. On the one hand, the corrupted version of Twilight had sounded just like that… but on the other hand, if there were seven evil alicorns after her they could probably have demolished the castle, whatever Celestia answered. “Alright, come in,” she said, pulling the nails out of the planks across her door.</p><p class="double">One by one, the ponies outside filed in. Luna was back to normal, but the Elements of Harmony were all… different, was the best way to put it. They still had their horns and wings, and were their normal colours.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight said, once they’d all entered. “Basically, there’s a strange phenomenon that’s been going on for a long time…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Did you have to promise that?” Dash asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, we <i>did</i> scare her quite badly…” Twilight replied. “And when you think about it, she’s been working for over a thousand years without a break.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I suppose.” The alicorn rustled her wings. “I could have done without us becoming the government this time, though. I did have a plan…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “At least there’s seven of us to spread the load.”</p><p class="double">“True.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “I’ve never seen a coronation ceremony happen so fast! She got all six of us confirmed as Princesses Regnant in five minutes flat!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord’s statue shattered open. “Right, time for some fun… where’s Celly, she’s usually good for a laugh… oh.” He looked around. “Are alicorns more common these days?”</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight nodded. “Pretty much.”</p><p class="double">The others moved into position.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy spoke up. “Now, mister Discord, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way, or the angry way.”</p><p class="double">“You <i>really</i> want to take the easy way.” Twilight confided.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Discord pulled an application form out of thin air. “Where’s the small print?”</p><p class="double">“The easy way is that you don’t get all chaotic.” Rarity started. “Then we see if you’re willing to learn about friendship.”</p><p class="double">“Hm…” the draconequus tapped his beard. “Boring. What’s the hard way?”</p><p class="double">Five necklaces and a crown flashed into existence.</p><p class="double">“Right, right. More statue time. I think I’ve had my fill of that for now. What’s the angry way?”</p><p class="double">Most of the alicorns dove for cover.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blinked. Once, twice… and then she smiled.</p><p class="double">It wasn’t a nice smile. There were too many teeth for that.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord hovered past Twilight, dropping his tattered application form.</p><p class="double">She picked it up. The box for ‘easy way’ was ticked three times, and had a note attached saying ‘for the love of me, easy waaaaay’.</p><p class="double">“That’s nice of him.” Twilight mused, grinning. “Okay, ‘shy, you can stop now.”</p><p class="double">Flying Hatred reverted instantly to Princess Fluttershy. “Okay. I hope I wasn’t too hard on him…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Discord tried to escape. Can you believe it? Fortunately, we were all ready for him, and he’s doing community service – mainly in local classrooms. Apparently he’s demonstrating what physics isn’t.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I liked the last postcard of yours. It looks like there’s a lovely view from the top of that mountain.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I’m glad you’re enjoying your holiday. Might I suggest the griffin lands next? I’ve heard there are some canyons there where the wind plays a tune as it blows through the rocks.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Disguised as a common guard, Chrysalis of the Changelings waited for her chance to strike. She’d spent the past month learning the routine and personality of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, and the time was ripe for her to replace the fool pony and usurp her place at the wedding in a months’ time.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that’s nice.” She heard her target say. “Shining, your sister says she’s visiting with her friends.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis’ ears pricked. Another distraction. Another wait.</p><p class="double">“Did she say when she’s coming?” The unicorn asked.</p><p class="double">“Er… right now.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nearly fell over as a huge flash of teleportation magic erupted not a length from where her disguised self was standing. When she’d recovered somewhat, she looked and felt for whoever this sister was-</p><p class="double">And saw no fewer than <i>six</i> more alicorns standing there.</p><p class="double">Quietly planning to fire her spies – possibly out of a cannon – she sent an abort signal through the changeling empathic network and started planning how to leave the country.</p><p class="double">Fast.</p><p class="double">One alicorn, she’d be able to deal with if she had the element of surprise. The country’s ruler, the thousands-of-years-old Celestia? Surprise and a great deal of magic from Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">Six at once? Buck that.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Sorry,” Cadence said awkwardly. “I’m afraid this is how this loop looks like going.”</p><p class="double">Prince Shining Armor shrugged. “At least I get paper based magic. Shields are nice, but I sometimes want a little more variety.”</p><p class="double">The six ponies normally known as the Elements of Harmony stared at Cadence with fixed expressions for another moment. Then Twilight (also known as the Deva Path of Love, this Loop) shook her head wearily. “Whatever. I do notice everyone in Naruto’s Loop seems to have been turned into a pony in some way… he’s not around, in case you were wondering. I checked.”</p><p class="double">Akatsuki looked even stranger than normal when they were <i>ponies</i> wearing matching cloaks. Rarity looked like she was barely restraining a redesign fit.</p><p class="double">“Er… so who’s Naruto been replaced by?” Animal Path Fluttershy asked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A dozen Village Hidden in the Everfree ponies jumped after the local troublemaker.</p><p class="double">“Ha!” he shouted, snapping his fingers and materializing a large trampoline. Most of them bounced off it, flying out of the village entirely, but one pony snapped out her wings and flew around it.</p><p class="double">“Huh?” With a <i>thud</i>, Scootaloo body-checked the joker into the ground. “Awww…”</p><p class="double">“Discord,” she shook her head. “Right, you’re cleaning up the monument. And without magic.”</p><p class="double">“Do I get chocolate milk afterwards?” Discord asked.</p><p class="double">“Alright,” she sighed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord sat in the corner of the classroom, waiting for their teacher to show up. He’d enjoyed his meals with Scootaloo and the other two academy teachers, and of course he’d passed his test… but apparently you got points off for pranks.</p><p class="double">So he’d <i>barely</i> passed. (It was a good thing that point deductions couldn’t result in a failing grade, or he’d have got negative eight hundred and twenty three percent.) And that got him on the team with the unicorn and the changeling making goo-goo eyes at one another while they waited.</p><p class="double">Then the door opened, and a blue-black pony stepped through. “Sorry I’m late. I got stuck on the moon after the Hokage got annoyed. I’m Luna, and I’ll be your teacher. Come on.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight ended the scrying spell, and the eight alicorns took deep breaths.</p><p class="double">“Discord. Discord is Naruto.” Cadence threw up her hooves. “Well, we’re doomed. He’s going to have to teach us the power of chaos, or something.”</p><p class="double">“Who’s the Hokage?” the Pony path, Dash, asked.</p><p class="double">“Celestia, of course.” Twilight rolled her eyes. “<i>That</i> one was obvious. But I checked – aside from the CMC being academy teachers like I showed you, no Mizuki, and us, we’ve seen all the changes. Orochimaru is as per normal, just a pony.”</p><p class="double">“Ew.” Everypony said.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that reminds me.” Cadence got out a notebook. “My current motivation is that an old friend of mine didn’t get married. Because of that, I want to make sure everyone in the elemental nations gets hooked up – and to do that, I will build the Dating Simulator.”</p><p class="double">“…did I imagine those capital letters?” asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Cadence grinned.</p><p class="double">“Well, this’ll be fun…” the Paths of Love chorused.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.5 (L337 m4n)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Berry Punch walked into a bar, like she did most days, and asked one of her favourite questions. “Bartender… give me the hardest liquor you got!”</p><p class="double">The bartender shrugged. “Sorry but we ran out of Liquor, Wine, and Ale… would you like a warm glass of milk instead?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Berry came awake with a violent start, stifling a scream. <i>No</i> alcohol?</p><p class="double">After a moment, she realized where she was, and went downstairs to get herself a nightcap to steady her nerves.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle walked into a large library, found herself a book to read, and sat down. Opening it, she was startled to find herself looking at blank pages.</p><p class="double">Blinking, she looked down the page, then rifled through the book. A feeling of dread building, she grabbed two more books from the case – only to see the same thing – before screaming “Where are the words!&quot;</p><p class="double"> Twilight woke up sweating and ran downstairs to her library. It took her four novels before she was certain her books were still fine.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Rather crude Luna. Messing with the dreams of our citizens,&quot; Celestia admonished, before turning her attention back to the nightmares.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sister, given how many times I have been told they pranked me, I feel I deserve one night of revenge. Now be quiet, I plan to mess with a certain apple for that bucking one loop.&quot; Luna looked into each dream, then gained a grin that would look more fitting on Nightmare Moon. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack came out to the front door of her farm, to find a number of ponies wearing black suits busily stripping it down.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, what are you doin’?&quot; Applejack protested, getting in the way of one.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re the Internal Revenue Service and you owe us back taxes for seven years… your assets are being liquidated,&quot; the pony in black stated calmly.</p><p class="double">Applejack gave the biggest scream yet, startling her siblings, and looked out every window in the house to check for tax ponies before finally going back to bed with the shakes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, oh yes! Next one on the revenge list is… Pinkie! She&#039;ll be the next to fall for her constant parties that one loop. So much cake… so much,&quot; Luna brooded, thinking about the picture she’d been shown of how much weight she’d gained that Loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.6 (continuation of 7.13)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “That’s right,” Celestia said. “Just one attack, nothing major.”</p><p class="double">The individual she was talking to twitched his nose.</p><p class="double">“No, you don’t need to actually kill anyone.” Seeing his reaction, the alicorn frowned. “Though I suppose you can threaten it if you feel like it.”</p><p class="double">After a moment, Angel Bunny rubbed the fingers of his forepaw against his thumb.</p><p class="double">“Five carts,” Celestia offered.</p><p class="double">Angel turned away in a huff.</p><p class="double">“Six?”</p><p class="double">The rabbit looked over his shoulder, and made a circling gesture with his hand.</p><p class="double">“All right, seven then.”</p><p class="double">Nods.</p><p class="double">“Right. I need to go contact the Golden Harvest family, they’re the only ones with that many carrots.” Celestia pointed a hoof. “You are a harsh negotiator for a lagomorph.”</p><p class="double">Angel shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia counted in her head. <i>Right. One rabbit attack, then a couple of timber wolf attacks… that sea serpent… a manticore… and, finally…</i></p><p class="double">This would cause her student to awaken the Elements if anything would. Admittedly, she wouldn’t have even tried this if it were not for how Twilight had gone exploring and found the things, but they still needed to be usable for Equestria to be safe. And with Luna out having a beach holiday, there had to be some other kind of threat.</p><p class="double">Which led to why the alicorn of the Sun was poking an Ursa Major with a stick.</p><p class="double">The enormous beast finally snorted, opened an eye… grabbed Celestia in a massive paw, and rolled over back to sleep with its new ‘soft toy’.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight scanned the Everfree forest, homing in on her mentor’s magical signature. She’d already contacted the Awake Luna, and knew it wasn’t her doing that the sun hadn’t come up yet – but a missing Celestia could be a serious problem.</p><p class="double">Possibly it was connected to why Angel Bunny had somehow demolished the town hall…</p><p class="double">Finally finding the right place, she cautiously entered the cave.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “While I’m sure you’re amused, Twilight,” Celestia said with her precious little remaining dignity, “I do rather need help. Ursa Major are so resistant to magic I can’t teleport out.”</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled around on the floor, still giggling. Every time she’d tried to come to her hooves, she’d caught sight of the complete opposite of ‘a pony with a teddy bear’ and gone right back to laughing herself silly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.7 (L33t M4n)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Girls! I thought of something for this loop to prepare for the changelings. The idea came to me after that time I accidentally caused a Soviet victory in that Loop with Einstein.&quot; Pinkie bounced happily along before pulling a projector out of nowhere and setting the film up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fellow ponies! There is an enemy hidden amongst us! CHANGELINGS! Trying to steal our home, the changelings lurk in the background!&quot; the narrator showed a scene of shadowy eyes peering from the dark.</p><p class="double">&quot;But how do you recognize those dangerous fiends? With a simple question.&quot;</p><p class="double">An earth pony with a shovel appeared on the screen.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you like working Lucy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; Lucy saluted with shovel in hoof.</p><p class="double">The camera panned right. Next to her was a pegasus in horrible changeling make-up</p><p class="double">&quot;And do <i>you</i> like working…?&quot; the narrator paused while a close up was used on the changeling.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huuh…&quot; she spoke unconvincingly before the scene shifted to the Equestrian flag.</p><p class="double">&quot;If her answer is anything but a yes, she is a CHANGELING!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.8 (Chojomeka)</p><p class="double">&quot;Just get it over with already, Ikari,&quot; growled the light coated Diamond Dog.</p><p class="double">&quot;…Well I guess the universe just decided to show you as you are in this loop, Asuka…” a tan pegasus replied. “You know… as a bitch?&quot;</p><p class="double">If Shinji&#039;s grin were any bigger it would have split his face in two. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.9 (Belgarion213)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony&#039;s life than studying, so I&#039;m sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year&#039;s location: Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!”</p><p class="double">Spike was about to counsel the miserable Twilight Sparkle after the princess’s words, but paused. He had been with the purple Unicorn since he was hatched at her entrance to the prestigious Academy she attended, but the almost unholy light that shone in those eyes… it worried him.</p><p class="double">He shrugged it off. After all, what was the worst that could happen?</p><p class="double">“Make friends,” he could hear Twilight muse, “…Spike! That just might work!”</p><p class="double">…Why did he ask these questions?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia, </i></p><p class="double"><i>I have arrived in Ponyville and am continuing my supervision for the upcoming Summer Sun Celebration. Ms Applejack of Sweet Apple Acres has assured me that the food is coming along swimmingly, while Rainbow Dash, leader of Weather Ponies in Ponyville, has been maintaining a clear sky. Ms Rarity has created some impeccable decorations, awaiting your arrival, while Ms Fluttershy has orchestrated a truly magical orchestra.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I have made some few suggestions and eagerly await your arrival for the Summer Sun Celebration. </i></p><p class="double"><i>Your faithful student,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Twilight Sparkle. </i></p><p class="double"><i>PS: I am running into problems keeping the spark of life in the animated golems from escaping. Do you have any suggestions for how I can keep the mana flow variation within safe parameters without using self-perpetuating seal script? I dislike the thought of using that option because of the problems Starswirl encountered in his examination with the ‘Tribbles’ but I cannot seem to get the mana flowing safely without it. These won’t be very good friends with that level of instability.</i></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia lowered the letter for a moment and stared into the distance. “…I didn’t mean it that way,” she said weakly. She supposed she <i>should</i> have been more direct to poor Twilight. A brilliant Unicorn but sometimes so distressingly literal minded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “I don’t know about you,” Rainbow Dash said, edging away from ‘Bright Wind’, “But they give me the creeps.” There was something about the friends of this newcomer, ‘Twilight Sparkle’, which just put her on edge. Maybe it was the way they didn’t seem to blink?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “…are you sure this is what the Princess wanted you to do?” Spike asked his friend nervously, staring <i>far</i> below him at the giant pit of boiling metal. He didn’t know <i>why</i> the Ponyville library had a shaft that lead to what he assumed was Equestria’s mantle, or how Twilight had found it, but even a Dragon was a bit frightened of the level of heat down there.</p><p class="double">“Of course Spike!” Twilight said, a dizzying number of glyphs floating around her in interlocking circles, half of them rotating clockwise, the other half counter-clockwise as her horn glowed almost scalding white and she wrote script directly onto raw metal refined from that furnace far below. “I can’t believe that I didn’t see it before! It’s obvious this is what she means!”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know….” Spike said slowly.</p><p class="double">Twilight kept smiling, while writing with a fine touch that only experience could bring on the metal far below. Of course she knew this wasn’t what Celestia had meant, but well there were <i>needs</i>.</p><p class="double">The dimensional pocket that she had learned (and dissected the spell array for) from one of the older Loopers was impressive, very impressive. It was obvious that it had been an incredible spell at its beginning, but centuries – perhaps millennia – had gone into increasing the efficiency it had, allowing her to sustain a small, self contained universe from her own power. One that would follow her between loops.</p><p class="double">That meant she could carry things between them, and Twilight Sparkle was a Mage. After that Star Wars loop and the <i>millions</i> of Pinkie Pies, the <i>hostile</i> Pinkie Pies… she would never feel safe again without her own subordinates.</p><p class="double">Most of the older Loopers used clones. They <i>were</i> useful, but Twilight kept trying to micromanage the sensory input and motor control of <i>all</i> of her bodies, not letting ‘shadows’ of her mind form. A habit most mages really interested in the workings of magic had, though it could be worked around according to Lina anyway.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle spun the metal in the air, as script so tiny and so dense that it looked like two giant swathes of purple magic formed over the glowing white piece… she fought the desire to cackle. She was not the cackling kind of Pony! </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">8.10 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">(Note: this ficlet assumes a “Dumbledore” or “manipulative-in-the-name-of-the-greater-good” Celestia.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u><b>Turning the Tables part 2</b></u></p><p class="double">Celestia caught the arriving scroll effortlessly as it flashed into existence. Philomena was perched on a stand in front of her as she took mid-afternoon tea in her private quarters. She noted the seal on it and smiled at the phoenix.</p><p class="double">“It seems my favourite student has found the Legend of the Two Sisters, and drawn the correct conclusions. Now all I need to do is get her to Ponyville.”</p><p class="double">She took a sip of tea and opened the scroll. Seconds later, the phoenix squawked in distress as she got doused in hot tea, courtesy of the Princess’s absolutely spectacular spit-take. </p><p class="double">“But… she…” Celestia stared at the scroll wide-eyed, as if continued observation would make the words on it change. “Going to a party with Spike? Just to make him happy?”</p><p class="double">Philomena flared up, instantly drying herself and chattered at the Princess.</p><p class="double">“Yes, it is a worthy thing to do, and I’m proud she showed consideration, but she couldn’t have chosen a worse time! If I send her to Ponyville without knowledge of the legend, she won’t know what she needs to do…”</p><p class="double">The phoenix chattered again.</p><p class="double">“Too clever for my own good am I?” Celestia looked distant. “I knew from the moment I saw and felt that rainbow shock-wave of magic that the spirits of the Elements of Harmony had arisen once again in the souls of ponies. I felt Twilight&#039;s magic resonate with it, so strongly, I knew she was the missing element, the one who could bring the others together, use them to their full potential for the first time since…”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “I felt the other elements being touched, connected by that rainbow wave, and I&#039;ve since felt them congregating in Ponyville. While I no longer have power over them, I still remember the sense of their magic. I&#039;m sure they&#039;re being drawn to one another, and if I can just put Twilight in close proximity, she should act as the focus, awaken them with the spark of friendship. But she&#039;ll need the husks of the crystals that once housed them as well, to store the awakened elements. </p><p class="double">“That was why I laid down those clues so many centuries ago, so they could be discovered at our old palace at the right time, to bring together the elements in the right way. I had worried that the element of magic might not be studious, but Twilight seemed perfect in that regard. They were cryptic against the possibility that the bearer might on realising the power they would come to wield, decide to use it for selfish reasons.”</p><p class="double">The phoenix gave a flaming snort, and series of squawks. </p><p class="double">“No, I don&#039;t think Twilight would misuse them either. She has consistently exceeded my expectations in every area, except that she could be more social. At any other time, going to that party with Spike would have been a good thing; it&#039;s only the timing that is inconvenient. Maybe I should have told her more directly, but everything seemed to be going so well without any further intervention. Now I may have no choice.”</p><p class="double">There was an interrogative cluck from Philomena. </p><p class="double">“I will summon her here, and tell her what she needs to know about my sister&#039;s banishment. Then I will tell her I need her to find the Elements, that they were hidden from me, but that I believe there may be records in Ponyville library. Then I will suggest she go in undercover as the overseer for the Summer Sun Celebration. That should put things back on the rails.”</p><p class="double">Philomena fluffed up and gave her another chattering telling off.</p><p class="double">The alicorn shook her head. “Tell her everything? I don&#039;t want to burden her with anything more than I have to. She can start out believing she merely has to find them, that she will ultimately have to wield them is something best left until she&#039;s had a chance to adapt. Maybe she could handle it all, but why take a chance? It&#039;s the same reason she can&#039;t know I intend to be captured. With the power of the conjunction, Nightmare Moon can overpower me, but keeping me from escaping the sun will weaken her greatly. So she won&#039;t be able to simply overpower Twilight and the other spirits before they can reactivate the husks. She&#039;ll have to use guile, and thankfully that isn&#039;t her strong point.” </p><p class="double">Celestia sighed. “I could have gotten everything prepared months in advance, but I couldn&#039;t risk the possibility that Nightmare Moon might be able to sense the spirits or the husks of the elements. Luna was once connected to them too, remember? The wild magic of the Everfree hides them, and Nightmare Moon will come after me, even if she senses the spirits in Ponyville, because – as far as she knows – I’m the bearer, and the only one who could use them against her.”</p><p class="double">The phoenix made a rasping sound. </p><p class="double">“You still think I should have told Twilight some of this, don&#039;t you? In hindsight, maybe I could have, but my original plan has been working up until now, and I&#039;d prefer not to change Wonderbolts in mid race.” Princess Celestia&#039;s horn glowed, and a quill and sheet of parchment appeared in front of her. “The less of all this I have to put in a letter, the better.”</p><p class="double">She smiled at her own unintentional poetry, and set to work, ignoring that Philomena had put a wing across her eyes and beak, clearly unhappy with the decided course of action.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had millennia of real experience of social situations from her many loops, including the loops where she&#039;d substituted for Celestia. Adding background memories from those same loops expanded that even further. So she was no longer the socially awkward filly she&#039;d started out as in the base time-line. Indeed, she could duplicate her mentor&#039;s air of sangfroid quite easily. Added to her own talent and understanding of the magic of friendship, she could have had the entire party eating out of her hoof in five minutes.</p><p class="double">Of course, being the sort of pony who could gain her alicorn-hood through her understanding of friendship, the idea of ponies worshipping her like that was repugnant. In all her loops, that was the one thing she&#039;d never attempted. However, that didn&#039;t mean she wouldn&#039;t use her abilities to help Spike and accomplish her overall plan. Though in part, that meant hiding her abilities, and reacting more like base time-line Twilight would have.</p><p class="double">So when her appearance at the entrance to the west castle courtyard with Spike on her back caused the conversations to quieten down, and most of the eyes of the mares and stallions assembled to turn on her, she made herself flinch with a nervousness she didn&#039;t actually feel, then visibly stiffened her shoulders and her resolve and headed for Moondancer, lowering Spike gently to her side.</p><p class="double">Trotting over to the white unicorn, she said, “Uh… hi, Twinkleshine told me about your party, and Spike wanted to come, and I felt I should come with him. I know you didn&#039;t exactly invite me directly, but Twinkleshine implied it&#039;d be okay…”</p><p class="double">Clearly, the white unicorn opposite her was still stunned by the fact that Twilight Sparkle, the Princess&#039;s own student, and the pony who never came to parties, was at hers. It would be a considerable social coup for her.</p><p class="double">Twilight reacted the way she once would have, starting to speed up her words, and glance around nervously. “…if it&#039;s a problem, I&#039;m sorry I intruded on your party, I didn&#039;t mean to cause problems, I really have to be getting back now I&#039;ve seen Spike safely here, I feel guilty enough that I told the princess I was taking time off to do this and I should go now before I make myself look any more foalish…”</p><p class="double">Twilight started to turn away only to hear, “Wait! I&#039;m very happy to have you here! I was just surprised. You don&#039;t normally come to any-pony&#039;s parties!”</p><p class="double">She let herself visibly relax, smiling at the other pony. “That&#039;s why I thought maybe I should start. I&#039;m good with magic, other ponies… not so much. I was reading some ancient legends about Starswirl the Bearded… I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m babbling, and Spike wanted to come see you especially.”</p><p class="double">That got the dragon exclaiming “Twilight!” in an embarrassed tone of voice, which made the other ponies giggle. Twilight had used magic and memory retention techniques to sharpen her already excellent memory to near perfect recall, but she&#039;d actually forgotten that before Spike had gone gaga over Rarity, he&#039;d been crushing on the pony in front of her.</p><p class="double">Still, the little dragon came forward and handed over his gift. Shyly, he said, “I got this for you, I hope you like it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight decided to make it up to her companion by tweaking it with a very low power want-it, need-it spell, synchronised to Moondancer. It would decay to untraceable levels in a few moments, and leave no permanent effect other than a vague fondness for the object. Moondancer reacted by hugging the teddy bear to her, and squealing “I love it!”</p><p class="double">Spike got picked up in her telekinesis too, and got a big kiss on the cheek. He floated away with hearts in his eyes. Towards the buffet table, of course, even romance didn&#039;t interfere with his appetite. Meanwhile Twilight was introduced around, Moondancer and Twinkleshine somehow coming to a time-sharing arrangement of some kind, possibly by telepathy.</p><p class="double">Twilight found she was enjoying herself immensely. For a looper, especially one as experienced as she was, novelty was more precious than gold… or, in her case, books. And yet here were dozens of ponies who before now she’d known only as part of the background, each with their own histories, ideas and quirks.</p><p class="double">Of course, they wanted to ask her things, about the princess, about problems they were having with some of the tougher parts of their studies, and a surprising number of them about her brother. It seemed that the Captain of the Guard had a lot of admirers, not all of them mares. It was something of a shock to find at least a couple of stallions, and one mare who were more interested in her as well. Those she deflected as gently and nicely as possible. </p><p class="double">She did her best to answer ponies&#039; questions where she could, but mostly she asked her own questions, and listened. Centuries of experience had shown her that you could be accounted a great conversationalist simply by getting other ponies (and most other sentient beings) to talk about themselves, and listening. Of course, all this new information was also like fine wine or new book, to be drunk in and filed carefully in her highly organised memory. </p><p class="double">In the cases of the people asking her for help, her questions explored what they did understand, and helped them to see what they didn’t. Something she’d learned from Princess Celestia was that guiding ponies to understanding something on their own made it stick far better than simply telling them. She’d wondered if that was part of the reason Princess Celestia had handled the quest for the Elements of Harmony the way she had, but the cases weren’t parallel. There was more at stake than just Twilight’s development as a pony, and while she was a bit awed that the Princess might have put that much value on it, she disagreed.</p><p class="double">She did play one small prank. While she’d finally forgiven her brother for all the past times that he hadn’t let her know about the wedding until the very last minute (after all, from his point of view, it was just the once) that didn’t mean she couldn’t prank him. Ponies asking about her brother were informed of his weakness for double chocolate cookies, though in fairness, she did tell the stallions that she was sure her brother didn’t walk that side of the paddock.</p><p class="double">It was working with no more than her base time-line self would have known, but the results should be that over the next couple of months, Shining Armour should end up getting a lot of love letters and boxes of cookies, not to mention approaches of varying directness. Before the end of it, he’d probably be sick of them.</p><p class="double">Of course, there was always some-pony ready to upset the apple cart.</p><p class="double">“Look at her, that stuck up little bookworm finally deigned to come mingle with the rest of us! Swanning around, showing off how smart she is!”</p><p class="double">It was a unicorn who went by the name Sharp Retort. While she had considerable talent as an alchemist, her magic scores, both theory and practical, were generally near the bottom of the table. Twilight had never really met her, but she’d heard the other defining characteristic of this pony was her sharp tongue, and her desire to make a big splash socially. </p><p class="double">In other words, she was a marginally more adult unicorn version of that evil minded little filly, Diamond Tiara, though with at least some actual redeeming features. After centuries of observation, Twilight had come to the conclusion that the only thing DT was good for was as a bad example. </p><p class="double">Twilight apologised to the mare she was helping to understand Marelin’s theory of Morphic Fungibility, and turned to face the other unicorn, who was also wearing a fancier dress than most of the ponies there. “That’s not how I’d have put it, but I assume you have a reason for saying so?”</p><p class="double">“You shouldn’t be here!” Sharp Retort sneered, “Go back to your books, it’s where you belong!”</p><p class="double">Base time-line Twilight would have bailed at this point, so she flinched, ears flicking back. She took a step back, then she visibly steadied herself. She glanced around and saw that most of the ponies, other than a couple who were obviously Sharp Retort’s pals, were looking on with sympathy or encouragement for her, or annoyance at Sharp Retort. </p><p class="double">Taking a deep breath, she replied, “Still not hearing a reason for your aggressiveness, but based on your test scores, attire and general attitude, it could be one of three possibilities. Either you are jealous of my academic achievements, my proximity to the Princess, or that you hoped to be the centre of attention here and my arrival spoiled that. Or it could be varying degrees of all three.” </p><p class="double">Sharp Retort’s body language told her she’d zapped the alchemist&#039;s weather-pony right between the wings. “Why you… why should I be jealous of a pathetic little bookworm like you? You don’t have any real friends, or any real life! You&#039;re just a bunch of books in the shape of a unicorn!”</p><p class="double">That got a number of looks of shock and disgust from her new friends, and she saw Spike, who’d been relaxing on a recliner by the buffet table, being fed tid-bits by a number of mares, jump up and start over, little arms swinging belligerently.</p><p class="double">The comment would have hurt base-line Twilight deeply. She gave another wince, then took a deep breath, speaking calmly. “You know, you’re absolutely right. It is rather sad that until today, the only thing I knew about most of the ponies around us were their test scores. Thank you for reminding me exactly why coming to this party was such a good idea. On that basis, you have nothing to be jealous of. So why are you?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not jealous! I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re all falling for her innocent act!” Sharp Retort looked around, but seeing no support from any-pony except her book ends, she gave a growl of annoyance and flounced out. </p><p class="double">Twilight went over to the host of the party, head slightly bowed. “I’m sorry, Moondancer, I didn’t mean to cause a scene.”</p><p class="double">“You weren’t the one causing it.” The other unicorn reassured her. “I’m sorry you had to deal with all that. That was just plain mean.”</p><p class="double">“However, she had a point.” Twilight sighed. “I should be getting back to my studies. I still feel really guilty that I went to this party without the Princess okaying it.”</p><p class="double">Spike had come up and hugged her leg. “C’mon Twi, we’re on break! I’m sure she won’t mind you taking one night off.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, surely you’re learning stuff here too?” Moondancer asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight decided they deserved a proper answer. While any-pony could generate a heart-song, it only happened when they were in the grip of some deep emotion. It had taken many loops to learn Pinkie Pie’s music-on-demand ability, but it was worth it for universes with a musical component, such as Equestria. “Oh yes, so much…”</p><p class="double">“My researches they were enough,</p><p class="double">And keeping my work up to snuff,</p><p class="double">Ponies as friends I did not miss,</p><p class="double">But I wasn’t prepared for this…</p><p class="double">“Who’d have thought that chatting was such fun,</p><p class="double">Learning about ponies one by one,</p><p class="double">Sharing memories and helping them out,</p><p class="double">It’s a wonderful new feeling without doubt!</p><p class="double">“Companionship that I did dismiss,</p><p class="double">Now I know that it’s simply bliss.</p><p class="double">Making some new friends, </p><p class="double">Helping ponies,</p><p class="double">Seeing what life sends,</p><p class="double">Not books only,</p><p class="double">I want to do more of this!”</p><p class="double">She had some idea of the workings of narrative causality from her long study of many universes, and there was no way the fates would let something like that pass without reacting. Cue Spike burping up a scroll with the Princess’s own seal. Depending on what was on it, the prank might end right here. Had Celestia learned that not providing enough information or guidance risked things going badly wrong, or was she still convinced that only she had the need to see the full picture?</p><p class="double">‘Twilight, my faithful student,</p><p class="double">I need to see you on a matter of great urgency. Come immediately to my chambers.</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia.’</p><p class="double">Apparently not. Twilight let the scroll drop to the floor, face an expression of shock. “It’s from the Princess, she wants to see me right away!”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged. “Okay, so what’s the problem? You love spending time with her.”</p><p class="double">“Oh Spike, don’t you see? I said I’d come here rather than continue working! She must think I’m not taking my studies seriously!”</p><p class="double">She was a bit embarrassed about acting like this, or rather the fact that she’d originally acted like this for real over a simple late letter. However, it was how she would have reacted back then, or rather how she believed she would have reacted. So she paced around, acting fuming and flustered, ears twiching.</p><p class="double">“What if she gives me a test on what I was supposed to be learning? What if I fail? You know what teachers do to students who fail? They send them back a grade!”</p><p class="double">“But Twilight, this was your project in the first place, and you’re not even in a grade!”</p><p class="double">“No, you’re right! She may just send me back to magic kindergarten!” Creating an illusion of herself sitting in a tiny desk seat, being laughed at by colts was easy enough, while she did her best impression of a thousand yard stare. ”No, she’ll probably dismiss me as her student altogether!!!”</p><p class="double">She was rather proud of managing to put three exclamation marks into a spoken sentence. Now it was time to put the cherry on top of this particular piece of humble pie. Before Spike could act as the voice of sanity, she teleported away to her tower study. She had a lot of things to do to enact the next part of her plan, and very little time to do them in.</p><p class="double">Moondancer looked confused. “What… just happened?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight’s off on one of her things again.” Spike sighed. “Maybe it’s because she’s so smart. She can find things to worry about that no-pony else would even think about. The Princess probably just wanted to ask her how she enjoyed the party. I’ll go find her and calm her down. She’s probably in her study… frantically studying whatever it was she thinks she was to be tested on.”</p><p class="double">After he’d left, the party was a bit subdued, but soon got back into full swing. Said swing came to a dead stop when Princess Celestia herself flashed into existence at the entrance to the courtyard. Every-pony turned towards her and bowed deeply.</p><p class="double">“Thank you, my little ponies.” The princess said with her usual grace. “I did not wish to interrupt your party, but I’m looking for Twilight Sparkle. I summoned her some time ago, and she had said she was at this party. Does any-pony know where she is now?”</p><p class="double">Moondancer answered, a bit nervously. “When she saw your letter, she…”</p><p class="double">“Freaked out!” Some-pony else said, after an awkward silence.</p><p class="double">“… freaked out. She was going on about you dismissing her as a student because she came here rather than studying.” The white unicorn took a few seconds to work up his nerve, then asked, “You, you wouldn&#039;t really do that, would you?”</p><p class="double">“Of course not!” Celestia was genuinely shocked. “I&#039;m pleased to see her making new friends, I just needed her for an important job.”</p><p class="double">“Spike did say she did this kind of thing occasionally. He said he was going back to her study to calm her down.”</p><p class="double">Celestia’s mind was set at ease now that she knew where to find her errant student. However, she was curious, in part because how Twilight did here would be a good indicator of how she might do in Ponyville. “Twilight is not the most social of ponies. Was she enjoying herself up until my message?”</p><p class="double">“If you call singing about it enjoying yourself, then yes I think she did.” Moondancer smirked. One way or another this party would be the most talked about of the year.</p><p class="double">“Twilight? Singing?” In her millennia of experience, she&#039;d had many surprises, but she’d never have imagined Twilight engaging in a heart-song, unless it was about a new book. “I see I may have to apologise to her, I had no idea she was that engaged in this party. Thank you all for making her welcome.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it wasn’t all one way, your highness.” Twinkleshine responded. “I mean, she was shy to start with, but as soon as she got talking… after five minutes you felt like you’d known her for ages.”</p><p class="double">There was a general agreement from the ponies around her. One of the stallions added, “She really helped me too. You hear that she’s this magical prodigy, but it’s another thing to actually see it.”</p><p class="double">“How so… Flash Card, isn’t it?” </p><p class="double">“Yes, your highness.” He looked a bit nervous when the princess turned her attention to him, but carried on. “I’ve been having trouble understanding amniomorphic spells, I can do them, but I have trouble with the theory side. Or rather, I did until I talked to Twilight. Professor Speller’s taken me through it, but I could never get what he was going on about. However, Twilight managed to figure out where I was going wrong, and show me. She did it all in about ten minutes, and she didn’t make me feel like an idiot for not understanding it already.” </p><p class="double">Celestia was impressed, not just at the level of skill his tale suggested, but that these ponies were all willing to come to Twilight’s support. As she knew herself, simply because you knew a subject didn’t mean you could teach it effectively. Once again, she wouldn’t have pegged Twilight as being one of the ones who could. She made a graceful departure, and headed for Twilight’s private tower, her confidence restored. It seemed, if anything, that her student was even more suited for her task than she’d imagined. </p><p class="double">As she flew up to the entrance to Twilight’s study, she composed herself to help Spike perform any remaining calming down that needed doing. When she reached the door, it was ajar, which seemed odd, so she went straight in. Spike was sitting in the middle of the room, staring blankly at the opened letter that was clutched in his paw..</p><p class="double">Another sealed letter sat on Twilight’s work table, with the seal that showed it was for Celestia’s eyes only. She picked it up and opened it, her earlier confidence replaced by worry. The writing was Twilight’s, but it was not her usual immaculate cursive script. The shakiness was slight, but it was clear her telekinesis had been disturbed by some great emotion.</p><p class="double">‘Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">I most humbly apologise for neglecting my studies in favour of socialising. I honestly believed a few hours delay in doing that research would make no difference. I will endeavour to avoid friendships in future as they are clearly too distracting. I so enjoyed myself that for some time I completely forgot about my work, something that is clearly unacceptable.</p><p class="double">However, that does not excuse my error. I have failed you, and as ruler of Equestria, you can not let that go unpunished. To save you the embarrassment of having to dismiss me, and myself the shame, I hereby submit my withdrawal from Celestia’s School for Gifted Unicorns. I will leave quietly, and find some other position. I hope you can eventually forgive me for not living up to your standards.</p><p>I remain your most devoted and faithful subject, </p><p class="double">Your ex-student,</p><p>Twilight Sparkle.’</p><p class="double">Celestia had experienced much in her vast lifespan, but she’d rarely felt the shock she did right then. Twilight had left? Her telekinesis snatched Spike’s letter from his paws, desperate to find any further scrap of information as to where she might be.</p><p class="double">‘Dear Spike,</p><p class="double">I have to leave for a while. I’m sorry to leave so abruptly, without saying good bye or explaining in person, but I have no choice. I’ve disgraced myself, disappointed the Princess, so I can no longer stay here. I can&#039;t return to my parents house either, not after this. Leaving you there was one of the hardest parts of my decision to do so. I would have taken you with me, but I shall have to find a new place to live, some other way to support myself, and in the meantime, things are likely to be tough.</p><p class="double">I can hear you as if you’re standing there in front of me, saying it doesn’t matter. Best of dragons, it does to me and I couldn’t ask you to share the hardships I’ve brought on myself. Princess Celestia will care for you, I&#039;m sure. As soon as I have somewhere to live, some way to provide for us both, I will let you know. If you still want to be assistant and best friend to a plain old unicorn, rather than Celestia’s favourite student, I certainly want you to be with me.</p><p class="double">Your friend,</p><p>Twilight Sparkle.’</p><p class="double">Having his letter taken off him had broken Spike out of his trance. He noticed Celestia for the first time, and his expression crumpled. “She was already gone when I got here!”</p><p class="double">He ran over to her, and she patted his back as he hugged her leg tightly. “Do not worry, this is all a silly misunderstanding, one that will be fixed as soon as I talk to her. I only needed her to undertake an important mission.”</p><p class="double">“But she&#039;s gone!” Spike cried out.</p><p class="double">“Not for long. Canterlot isn&#039;t Manehattan you know. I shall have Shining Armour and the entire Royal Guard comb the city for her. I&#039;m sure they will find her within the hour, and then we can put this whole unfortunate incident behind us.”</p><p class="double">She placed him on her back, and carried him out of the tower, mind whirring. She considered the dragon on her back, and what she&#039;d found out earlier. “Tell me Spike, does Twilight truly see me as so strict? I would never punish her so harshly, even if I felt her taking time off from her studies to make new friends to be a bad thing, which I don&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe you should have told her that!” Spike snapped, then looked away, ashamed. “I&#039;m sorry, Princess.”</p><p class="double">“Never be ashamed of speaking your mind.” Her magic gently brought his chin up. “Your loyalty to her does her credit, and you too. Now, please tell me your mind.”</p><p class="double">Spike was clearly debating with himself on exactly what to say, loyalty warring with honesty. “No, it&#039;s sort of… You know she&#039;s kind of nuts about getting everything just right. She worships you, too. When she&#039;s pushing herself with another all-nighter, I think she uses the idea that it&#039;s what you expect of her to push herself that bit more. She invents these over the top punishments because to her, pleasing you is the most important thing in the world. So failing is the worst crime, and deserves the worst punishment.”</p><p class="double">“So she projects her own desire for perfection onto me?” Celestia was feeling rather guilty as she flew towards the Royal Guard barracks. She&#039;d left well enough alone because a studious Twilight was exactly what she needed the sixth element to be. It sounded like Twilight had been heading down the wrong path that Starswirl the Bearded had once trod. Maybe if she&#039;d encouraged her to have more of a social life outside her studies, she&#039;d have been less likely to see it as a failing.</p><p class="double">In an immortal, self honesty was even more important than in most ponies. The accumulated subconscious garbage of facts you kept yourself from acknowledging as the centuries piled up could send you into madness as surely as Discord. So when she realised something she had hidden from herself, she faced it squarely.</p><p class="double">It was clear now that she&#039;d made not one but two grave errors. Firstly, she had focussed on developing Twilight&#039;s magical abilities and studious nature in preparation for her destiny as the Bearer of the Element of Magic, and in the process unconsciously dismissed her development in other areas as unimportant. As long as Twilight was able to make friends with the other bearers and was loyal to Celestia, that was enough.</p><p class="double">It was not something she&#039;d have ever decided consciously, indeed the idea of using a pony like that horrified her. Twilight was more to her than some magical super-weapon, even without her destiny, Celestia would still have taken her on as a personal student, as someone with that sort of raw magical potential and desire to learn came along once in a millennium (and she was one of very few ponies who could confirm that from personal experience). She was dear to Celestia, and the alicorn princess only wanted the best things for her.</p><p class="double">But the fact that she hadn&#039;t consciously considered what that meant, that she&#039;d assumed that everything was working out well had led to this mess. Now that that unconscious assumption had been brought out into the light, she could easily pick it apart. Without prior experience of making friends, how would Twilight have even the tools needed to make those vital friendships, or understand their importance in the first place? While Twilight seemed to have avoided that, from her performance at the party, the very fact that her existing social circle was so sparse and her development in other areas so limited had left her without other sources of strength, without the more balanced appreciation of things when her very loyalty and over-commitment had made her turn a minor incident into a huge betrayal.</p><p class="double">It was symptomatic of a larger problem, the way she&#039;d approached both the task of Twilight&#039;s personal development and the restoration of the Elements. She&#039;d ruled for millennia, and in that time, she&#039;d formulated some basic guidelines for successful rulership, the most important of which was not to do anything unless it was absolutely needed. As her Appleoosian subjects would say, &#039;If it ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it.&#039;</p><p class="double">She could so easily have become a tyrant, not in the manner of King Sombra, but simply by helping out her subjects too much, making them any more dependant on her and not able to solve their own problems, or grow from that experience. Yes, she could have made Equestria a place where no-pony ever wanted for anything or had to do anything other than exist and fill their time with parties and play, but she&#039;d rather go Nightmare herself than live in such a &#039;utopia&#039;.</p><p class="double">As a result, she&#039;d become master of the subtle nudge, the indirect approach, never acting directly where she could get other ponies to do it, or even find a solution for themselves. Most of her direct actions apart from raising the sun were stopping some-pony from doing something self-aggrandising, or that while appearing good in the short term would have long term negative consequences. But while her breadth of knowledge and long term viewpoint gave her a degree of wisdom, she was neither omnipotent nor omniscient. Philomena&#039;s arguments came back to her, and Spike&#039;s outburst. After so long she&#039;d become set in her ways, and been unable to realise that this situation required a different approach. After so many centuries as the subtle manipulator, when a situation came up that did require a more horn-on approach, she hadn&#039;t recognised the fact, content to let things develop as they&#039;d seemed to be working out.</p><p class="double">She resolved to make it up to Twilight when she next saw her. She&#039;d done what was easy rather than what was needed and it had cost her, and possibly many others including Twilight and her sister. She could have made the argument that she&#039;d trusted Twilight to figure out what to do on her own, but the case could also be made that she&#039;d showed a lack of trust in not believing Twilight could handle the information, a lack of faith that the unicorn could accept the responsibility without being tricked into it. When she next saw Twilight, there would be full disclosure, and a serious apology. She was Princess Celestia, and she would make things right.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry Spike. I <i>will</i> fix this.” She landed in the courtyard of the barracks, taking the startled salute of the guards training there. “I need to see Captain Shining Amour, at once!”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='9'></a><h3>Loops 9</h3>
<p>9.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “You know…” Sweetie mused. “There’s something we should really do in these loops.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Applebloom asked. “Like, look for our cutie marks? Again?”</p><p class="double">“No,” Sweetie said, “not that. I mean, we should learn how to actually <i>do</i> things. Not just try to find the one thing we’re magically good at.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shrugged. “I dunno. What do you mean?”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Sweetie blushed. “I’d kind of like to know how to cook. Not, special talent, know how to cook, but more… actually-the-right-shape-food cook.”</p><p class="double">The other two nodded, understanding.</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” Sweetie continued, “I was going to ask Rarity about that. She’s fairly good. We’ll see how it goes. What about you, ‘bloom?”</p><p class="double">The earth pony thought for a bit. “Perhaps ah’ll pay more attention when Big Mac tries to get me to help on th’ farm.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo spoke up. “And I’m going to try to learn some math. Last time Dash and I both looped, she said that math was important in understanding… well, cool stuff, like fighter planes.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Oh, dear,” Rarity said, “Well, it’s nice that you want to learn, but I’m afraid I’m really not good at… well… simple foods.” She shrugged. “Perhaps you could ask Big Mac? I’ve heard that he’s the one who does a lot of the cooking whenever there’s an Apple family reunion…”</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Sweetie replied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Mac slumped into bed.</p><p class="double">Oh, it wasn’t the work that had him tired out. No, it was that his littler sister and her two friends were constantly pestering him for help.</p><p class="double">If it wasn’t how to help run the farm, it was maths. If it wasn’t either of those, it was how to cook.</p><p class="double">Still, there were compensations.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. “Thanks, Twi. Ah felt like Mac deserved somethin’ for handlin’ all three of the Crusaders so well this Loop.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “It wasn’t much, really. All I did was point out to Cheerilee that he was probably halving her workload, and she sent him a thank you card, and…”</p><p class="double">“This happen a lot?” Applejack asked. “Mac and Cheerilee, ah mean.”</p><p class="double">“Somewhat.” Twilight shrugged. “It can go either way.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.2 (L33t m4n)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Girls, I know this is a new loop, but I have a plan. When the wedding occurs I want to do something drastic.&quot; Twilight had gone through this a thousand times, but a new twist is what made the monotony nonexistent.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twi, I don&#039;t like that grin on your face. That&#039;s the grin that made the town go through a crazy compulsion for a doll,” Applejack worried – not entirely without justification.</p><p class="double">&quot;Relax. I just need the magic pool, some training grounds, and a place to keep the clones. As a great sorceror once said: magic must defeat magic!&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight may have had a crazy streak, but her craziness was warranted at times.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you’re hoping to use clones…to defeat clones!&quot; Pinkie realized that this was something that was worth the crazy streak. She had a plan to differentiate the clones from herself this time if she was to take a dip in that clone pool again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep! Wanted to save it for a Star Wars loop, but a little sneak peek won&#039;t hurt.&quot; The grin was going cheshire by this point, and making some of the loopers uneasy about how this would go.</p><p class="double">&quot;And personality dear? You have a plan for that?&quot; Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Planned for that as well… look, girls, I have it all planned out. Just need a little help with getting it accomplished.&quot; Twilight replaced her grin with a reassuring smile which broke the remaining resistance towards the plan.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright listen up! You want to be the best! You want to fly circles around the others and make them wail! You want to be the coolest!&quot; Rainbow yelled out, flying above the others in drill sergeant mode.</p><p class="double">&quot;YEAH!&quot; a number of clones responded with equal fervor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then you are going to start off with being cool!&quot; Rainbow brought a board down with her list of attributes to succeed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright dears, today we’re learning how to cross-stitch, and make an outfit with a fitting theme.&quot; Rarity brought the needle up with magic before bringing up several spools of thread and fabric from her table. &quot;Now watch, and do as I do.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Teaching care and attention to detail is always good… as well as getting my work backlog cleared, of course… </i>Rarity thought to herself.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay…now if it isn&#039;t a problem, I hope to show you … um excuse me,&quot; Fluttershy was teaching about looking after the critters at her place but the clones were too simple – most were too busy either chasing the animals or playing with them to focus on the shy, little pegasus&#039; words.</p><p class="double">&quot;I SAID LISTEN!&quot; Fluttershy entered Flying Hatred mode, before calming down and turning her dark form off. &quot;Alright now return to your seats and take care of each animal. Also no fooling around or being rough, understand!&quot; Fluttershy ended her sentence with a &#039;Stare&#039; which drove any disobedience out of the clones before resuming her lesson.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie didn&#039;t focus much on teaching, instead concentrating on keeping the group together and teaching them how to make a fantastic party and how the party cannon worked.</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s how you make an amazing gazpacho. Any questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">One clone raised her hand before jumping back when Pinkie appeared in front of her. &quot;Yes Twi-clone 265?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, how does any of what you said relate to partying or teaching us?&quot; the clone asked cautiously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! How silly, I&#039;m supposed to be teaching you skills. Right we&#039;ll start with making the perfect surprise . . .&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright ya&#039;ll now bring that harvest in and we&#039;ll be ready for the coming winter.&quot; Applejack figured she’d teach them the appreciation of hard work, and benefit from the process. Rarity had done it, why not her?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Good job, girls! When the wedding happens Chrysalis won&#039;t know what hit her. This might be something to do more often.&quot; Twilight cheered, looking the clones over alongside her friends.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis crouched behind an overturned table, using a fruit bowl as a helmet. “This is not going well.”</p><p class="double">Another Changeling went flying through the air and bounced off her makeshift barricade.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;(L33t m4n)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The telephone rang.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, may I speak with the owner of the &quot;Stone Pony&quot; bar?&quot; Ruby Pinch spoke, her tone anxious.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, what can I do for you, kid?&quot; said owner groggily answered while checking his clock.</p><p class="double">&quot;My mom is asking if you could please, open the bar a bit earlier today.&quot; Ruby Pinch asked hopefully into the phone</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me guess, your mommy must be a Berry Punch, right?&quot; the owner frowned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, she&#039;s Berry Punch and...&quot; Ruby got out before the owner interrupted her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Figures...look kiddo, the bar strictly opens at 8:00 pm and it’s barely 2:00 pm right now so...&quot; he gruffly replied while barely stopping himself from hanging up right there</p><p class="double">&quot;But mister...&quot; Ruby pleaded</p><p class="double">&quot;No buts young filly, tell your mommy that if she wants to get in the bar...&quot; he was used to Berry trying stunts like this… but never before had she roped her daughter into it.</p><p class="double">&quot;But mister, you don&#039;t understand...&quot; Ruby pressed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t understand what?&quot; The stallion was seriously considering just putting the phone down.</p><p class="double">&quot;My mom doesn&#039;t want to get in; she wants to get out...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Wait, Berry is Awake this Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shrugged. &quot;Ah only found out when she volunteered t&#039; help with th&#039; Super Squeezy thing next week. Guess she just ain&#039;t one for movin&#039; and shakin&#039;. Actually, she&#039;s mostly been breakin&#039; into bars.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.4 (Madfish)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hundreds of loops had passed and, finding herself nostalgic and the only one Awake, Twilight had set about trying to relive that first time as closely as possible.</p><p class="double">Checking on her mental script Twilight finished her speech, &quot;It creates the sixth element– The Element of Magic!&quot;</p><p class="double">She felt her magic and that of the others fill her and expand… but was surprised when their energies pulled together without levitating them. &quot;That&#039;s odd,&quot; she thought as suddenly instead of forming the Rainbow of Light it instead glared a brilliant white.</p><p class="double">Familiar with magical overloads she was about to dive for cover when a humanoid dived forth from it into the air with a cry of &quot;By your powers combined– I am Captain Planet!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hundreds of loops had passed and, finding herself nostalgic and the only one Awake, Twilight had set about trying to relive that first time as closely as possible. Yes, last time it hadn&#039;t worked, but this time there was no sign of a fused loop to interfere.</p><p class="double">Once more checking off her mental script Twilight finished her speech but focused more on the world around checking for any anomalies that would throw things off, &quot;It creates the sith element– The Element of Magic!&quot;</p><p class="double">She felt her magic and that of the others fill her and expand… but was surprised when their energies pulled together without levitating them. &quot;Not again,&quot; she thought as suddenly instead of forming the Rainbow of Light it instead pulsed a dull marble grey light.</p><p class="double">Familiar with magical overloads but rather less worried this time she waited and a humanoid stepped with a definite finality from it into the air.</p><p class="double">&quot;Buck me,&quot; Twilight said in surprise as she took in the black clad figure before her, &quot;this won&#039;t end well.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the figure drew its iconic weapon, it spoke with a voice filled with loss, pain and bitterness. &quot;Bearer of Friendship. I find your lack of faith disturbing.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Again the only one Awake, Twilight had yet again set about trying to relive that first time as closely as possible. Hopefully, this time it would be perfect!</p><p class="double">Checking on her mental script Twilight launched into her speech.</p><p class="double">This time she didn&#039;t even get as far as before. Upon declaring &quot;These are my friends!&quot; Instead of the spherical form of the Element of Magic appearing a large bronze oil lamp beaned her on the head.</p><p class="double">Face hoofing she gave it a look as it lay on its side on the floor. &quot;You know what? I can work with this,&quot; she snarked, giving it a rub. Not even looking as clouds appeared she spoke quickly so as to finish with the dangerous object as soon as possible. &quot;Genie! First wish! That all those who threaten to take over or harm Equestria and/or its inhabitants would be healed by the Elements of Harmony of such desires! Second Wish! I wish that from when I next wake up I&#039;d understand how Pinkie does what she does! Third Wish! I wish you were free!&quot;</p><p class="double">Taking a deep breath she turned around… expecting to see the Blue genie she&#039;d been dying to introduce Pinkie Pie to, and instead seeing a rather more intimidating red one.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Many many many loops later, Twilight was the only one Awake… &quot;Sod it.&quot; She went Alicorn, cast age regression on Nightmare Moon and summoned Celestia. &quot;Your problem. I&#039;m not taking any more chances.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9. 5 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked down at the two fillies standing by the two seater Mareitech space fighter. &quot;Cadets Scootaloo, Apple Bloom, you made top scores in the simulator, but I wouldn&#039;t be sending you out if our losses to the Zentradi weren&#039;t so high. Command thinks I&#039;m nuts for giving two Cadet fillies who don&#039;t have a cutie-mark yet a Mareitech, especially with your handicap Scoots. Prove them wrong! You&#039;ve got the makings of greatness, both of you, if you can keep it together. I&#039;ll try and look out for you out there, but Rainbow Squadron is going to take up most of my time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes mam, Captain Dash!&quot; Scootaloo beamed. Dash didn&#039;t seem to be Awake, unlike the three fillies, and they hadn&#039;t even worked out where the Anchor was. From what Princess Twilight had said in their first loop, there had to be one, though this was an odd loop. They were on board a ten mile long spaceship, the Marecross, which had crashed into Equestria a millenium ago, filled with advanced technology. Only Princess Luna&#039;s efforts had prevented it from crashing with a force that would have wiped out Equestria, and since then, it had almost been forgotten that the Guardian of the Night Skies had once not been as revered as Celestia.</p><p class="double">The vessel had turned out to be a warship, and one that had been in multiple battles before it was abandoned and Princesses Celestia and Luna had decreed that it must be studied. While they could guard the world, there might be other live ships out there, and whatever had attacked this one. Over the centuries pony scientists and mages had figured out the prnciples behind it&#039;s construction and in the process had advanced Equestria&#039;s own technology level. They&#039;d rebuilt the ship and in the fillies own lifetimes, figured out how to repair the automated factories and variable configuration space fighters that made up it&#039;s primary armament with a mix of technology and magic.</p><p class="double">Just in time as well. The Zentradi had attacked, and with a fleet so huge even the Princesses had been hard pressed to shield Equestria from it. The ship, renamed the Marecross had performed an emergency Hyperwink to get out behind the enemy fleet, and through a malfunction in the generator system taken the whole of Ponyville with it. They&#039;d rebuilt the town in one of the cargo holds, and now they fought against the Zentradi, trying to find a way to defeat the fleet and save Equestria.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle came up to them as the two put on their interface helmets and they indulged in a three way hug. &quot;Be careful out there!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry!&quot; Scootaloo gave a cocky grin. &quot;It&#039;s just a scouting patrol. We&#039;ll be back in time to see you win the Miss Marecross competition.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; Apple Bloom tapped the side of the fighter, currently kneeling down in pegasus mode. &quot;I&#039;ve got this baby tuned sweet as Granny Smith&#039;s Zap Apple pie. Who&#039;d have thought I&#039;d be good at fixing protoculture tech?&quot;</p><p class="double">They scrambled up into their positions, resting on the belly saddles and locking their hooves into the fore and aft control boots. The canpies came down, and Scootaloo trotted the fighter onto a vehicle lift.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mareitech 86, Red Squadron Beta 4, Marecross Control, ready for launch!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You are cleared for launch Beta four. Moving you to launch position. Beta One will meet you at Waypoint One to begin your patrol. Sending guidance co-ordinates.&quot;</p><p class="double">The fighter rose up through multiple sets of air-tight locks to the landing deck, open to space but normally pressurised by the bubble of air retained inside the Marecross&#039;s navigational deflector shield. As Apple bloom programmed the navigation waypoints with the bootstick controls, Scootaloo walked the vehicle onto a launch catapult, and folded it down into fighter mode. A prssure suited deck unicorn signalled all clear with an illuminated baton, and they were pressed back in their saddles as the fighter was shot into space.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.6 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u><b>Scootaloo the Pegasus</b></u></p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash was right!” Scootaloo called out as she dived down from her wing assisted jump and smashed her fore-hooves through the moto-bug. “This is awesome!”</p><p class="double">Her wings blurred like a humming bird as she glided across the now battered turf of Green Hills zone on her red and white patterned Lightspeed horseshoes at speeds beyond sanity, while doing manoeuvres that most jet fighters would find nauseating. She passed down a line of floating gold rings and felt them vanish as they touched her.</p><p class="double">She skidded to a stop short of the striped pole, that generally meant something bad up ahead, and glanced up. “Though it’s kinda silly that you can fly and I can’t.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom floated down, tail whirring as she spun a ring shaped rotor blade with it. She dropped the last few feet and let the ring collapse in on itself forming a band on the tip of her tail. “You’ve got super-speed and you’re tougher than an alicorn, what more do you want? Though I gotta admit, being a tech genius is kinda sweet all by itself. How’re the new boots holding up?”</p><p class="double">“I figure I’m at least 20% faster! Watch out!” A flight of buzz bombers swooped in and the pair spilt, Scootaloo bounding into the middle of the cluster and zipping back and forth, jumping and smashing as she went, while Apple Bloom spun up her tail, expanding the rotor to its full size. She flicked it, and it span away bisecting a buzz bomber that was diving at Scootaloo’s back and freeing the bird trapped inside.</p><p class="double">It kept spinning back to her like a boomerang, and each time, she caught it on her tail by the padded interior ring, and flicked it out again to demolish one of the outriders while Scootaloo wreaked havoc in the heart of the formation. “Whooee! Take that you mechanical bozos!”</p><p class="double">Even as the last of Dr Robotnik’s latest wave of creations fell to the earth in smoking, sparking pieces, the Earth pony was in among the carcasses, transferring various parts into her saddle bags. Scootaloo landed beside her and asked, “What’re you doing?”</p><p class="double">“I wanted to build something like your old scooter but better. Using Kutta–Joukowski Lift Theorem, and some of the kinematic motivators I just scored off these badniks, I should be able to build a sort of hover board. You should be able to do all your old stunts and a bunch more besides. I could also use some parts for the Tornado.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds cool, but isn’t hover-board kind of a dorky name for a piece of gear that extreme.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, how about Extreme Gear?” Apple Bloom mused.</p><p class="double">“I like it!” Scootaloo grinned. “Extreme Gear it is!”</p><p class="double">“Only problem is the wind-chill factor from moving that fast, It’s going to be way past cool. Maybe I can apply a diverting force to the air current flowing over the nose…”</p><p class="double">“Later, we’ve got more company, and it looks like the big cheese omelette himself!”</p><p class="double">The pair of them set themselves up and raced off to face the Doctor’s latest creation.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “I’m bored…” Sweetie muttered. “When do we get to do something?”</p><p class="double">“Based on what I remember…” Twilight trailed off, counting in her head. “About another six months. Now, keep practicing telekinesis. You’re going to need to be good at it for… whatever the hell we have to do.”</p><p class="double">“You don’t know?” Sweetie asked, levitating a box.</p><p class="double">“No,” Twilight said. “And it’s very annoying. Basically, <i>something</i> happened last time with a telekinetic and a pyrokinetic, but it got very confusing and neither Dash nor I have much idea <i>what</i> it was.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, and stretched. Unlike some Loops, she’d actually been lying down when she gained awareness.</p><p class="double">The ground under her was dusty and hard. When she opened her eyes, she saw a black sky with twinkling stars overhead and a cratered landscape.</p><p class="double"><i>That’s vaguely unfair,</i> she thought as she looked around. <i>I’ve started the Loop already banished.</i> Twilight got up, using her wings as counterweights rather than flapping them given the lack of air. A moment later, there was a <i>pop</i> as she fired off a huge air-bubble spell – while she didn’t <i>need</i> to breathe, it <i>was</i> nice.</p><p class="double">“Hi,” Dash’s voice said from behind her.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hi, Dash.” Twilight frowned, and shook her head as she turned. “Why are there two of – erk!”</p><p class="double">The other nine Looping alicorns all waved at her. Pinkie then started pulling things out of her mane – a table, some chairs, and a board game.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we’re going to be here a while…” Applejack muttered. “Hope Pinkie has enough board games.”</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Twilight said, trying to get her Loop memories to return. “If we’re <i>all</i> up here, what’s going on down there?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Right,” the newly self-crowned Queen Chrysalis said. “Now we’ve managed to turn those pesky Elements against the very rulers who relied on them, we have a thousand years to rule Equestria before they get back.”</p><p class="double">King Sombra nodded. “And, of course, actually get married.”</p><p class="double">“True, true…” Chrysalis frowned. “How does an outdoor wedding sound?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.8 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight came to in a familiar Canterlot Park and waited for her loop memories to come in.</p><p class="double">And waited.</p><p class="double">She frowned. &quot;Shouldn&#039;t I be remembering what my life is like here?&quot; Opening her eyes, she did a quick inventory. She was an alicorn and had her Haversack saddlebags from Eberron in easy reach. From the heft of it, she was wearing her ceremonial tiara, and not the &#039;big crown thingy&#039; the Element of Magic tended to manifest as for her. She was almost to her hooves when a familiar voice, distorted by not coming from <i>her</i> mouth reached her ears.</p><p class="double">&quot;. . . and Harmony has been maintained for generations ever since.&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight Sparkle very carefully poked her head from the bushes and watched a perfectly normal pre-Ponyville version of herself ponder a very familar book.</p><p class="double">“The Elements of Harmony...” the younger Twilight mused. “I know I&#039;ve heard of them before... but where?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh.&quot; The princess wondered. &quot;Dash was right. I <i>was</i> adorkable.&quot; She settled her wings and decided to follow as stealthily as she could. It might be kind of interesting to see how things went when she herself wasn&#039;t the focus of everything. &quot;Hm. Should I help her... or finally see what Moondancer&#039;s party was like?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had been difficult keeping back and letting the native Twilight meet her future friends. &quot;Not least because I want to strangle the little recluse at times,&quot; Princess Twilight muttered. The additional difficulties of keeping herself hidden from Princess Celestia and an astral projection of Nightmare Moon were as nothing to keeping her first actual encounter with Pinkie Pie this loop from interfering with destiny.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Pie,&quot; she said gently. &quot;Go ahead and take care of your other new pony-slash-Summer Sun party. She needs it more than I do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;B-but Princess Vespertine! You&#039;re a new princess! Don&#039;t you deserve one, too?&quot; The Pink Party Pony pouted.</p><p class="double">&#039;Vespertine&#039; laid a gentle wing across Pinkie&#039;s withers, glad she&#039;d been able to come up with an alias so quickly. &quot;I <i>promise</i> I&#039;ll attend one of your parties very soon, just not this one. Cross my heart --&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s eyes widened.</p><p class="double">The looping Twilight twitched the tips of her wings. &quot;-- Hope to fly --&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s smile widened.</p><p class="double">&quot;--stick a cupcake in my -- OW!&quot; The alicorn sheepishly lowered her hoof. &quot;That last bit always gets me. Now, let me help you get into the library to set up before I have to go take care of &#039;Princess Stuff.&#039; Oh, for the banner? Her name is Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was actually kind of nice to see the rest of Ponyville during that first day without the pressure of making sure she met her friends at the proper times to ensure they became friends during the trip to the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters.</p><p class="double">However it seemed that &quot;Vespertine&#039;s&quot; attempts at subtlety had failed. Somepony had told the Mayor about her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here she is, your highness,&quot; Mayor Mare said, pointing right at her and looking at somepony else around the corner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance! What a surprise!&quot; Celestia said, with her eyes closed in a friendly smile. The smile turned to shock when she opened her eyes and the princess before her had the wrong coat color. &quot;Twilight? What? How?&quot; Under the shock was pride; Twilight could tell.</p><p class="double">Twilight curtseyed exactly the same amount Luna would have if she were in her right mind, a bit of archaic formality to drive her point home. &quot;I&#039;m not the Twilight you sent to check on the preparations today.&quot; She tilted her head and checked the position of the sun and the weather. &quot;She&#039;s doing exactly what you assigned her to do, despite herself. And from what&#039;s going on with the weather, she&#039;s just meeting the third of her new friends.&quot; She chuckled at herself. &quot;For convenience&#039;s sake, call me Vespertine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s guarded expression would have wounded her deeply before the loops, but she&#039;d been through enough loops to know this was mainly a show for the Mayor. Most wouldn&#039;t have the sheer knowledge of Celestia to know where she got her tells from. After the Mayor was gently dismissed, the two alicorns began to converse in earnest.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You foal!&quot; Nightmare Moon gloated. &quot;I&#039;ve destroyed the Elements of Harmony! Celestia is imprisoned in the sun! And best of all, I&#039;ve got your alicorn sister at my mercy. What chance does a normal unicorn such as you stand against me?&quot;</p><p class="double">The native Twilight Sparkle scrunched her nose up. &quot;Sister? I don&#039;t have a sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know I&#039;ve said this before, but... You&#039;re kidding. You&#039;re kidding, right?&quot; Nightmare Moon asked.</p><p class="double">Vespertine smirked from within her bonds as she heard her friends, or at least this loop&#039;s version of them. &quot;You&#039;re about to get schooled, Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;But Princess Vespertine!&quot; Twilight Sparkle protested. &quot;I don&#039;t get it! Where did you come from? I mean, I appreciate the distraction you provided...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Twilight,&quot; Pinkie Pie said. &quot;When a momma alicorn and a daddy alicorn love each other very much....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie!&quot; Rarity gasped, scandalized.</p><p class="double">The looping Twilight laughed. &quot;Let&#039;s just say that Cadance and I share some things in common, and you and I share common ancestors, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.9 (Rufus Shinra)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up and took quickly notice of her surroundings, with the casual expertise that came with a very long experience in finding out the most information possible from a single glance.</p><p class="double"><i>Human housing, Japanese traditional</i>, she immediatly deduced as she saw the paper walls. The next item was another obvious help to her. <i>A TV set, early nuclear era and... OK, I&#039;m still in unicorn shape and no additional memories. So... where am I?</i></p><p class="double">She turned around when she heard one of the doors sliding, facing a mid-twenties human, holding a wrench while his clothes and hands had some traces of motor oil. He apparently didn&#039;t look surprised in any way to the purple unicorn that appeared in his house:</p><p class="double">&quot;So... Looper?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,” answered the wielder of the Element of Magic, pleased to see that she wouldn&#039;t have to wait too much to know where she ended up. &quot;You too?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not exactly,&quot; he said, before putting back his tool in a cupboard. &quot;You could say that I&#039;m &#039;Awake&#039;, but not in the sense you guys are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How so?&quot; she asked, interested in a possible variation of the common pattern of Loopers and Anchors.</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you met Ranma, Harry or the others? Have they told you why the multiverse is looping like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,” Twilight admitted. &quot;They told me about that computer, Yggdrasil, and how they had to reboot the various universes periodically with us inside.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,” the young man said, nodding.</p><p class="double">&quot;And what does this mean for your universe? You said you were &#039;Awake&#039; in a different way? Are you an Anchor?&quot; Twilight continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, just the sysadmin&#039;s boyfriend.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. You must have seen...&quot; Twilight trailed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty much every Anchor and quite a few regular Loopers end up here sooner or later so they can meet the Norns. Beyond that, it&#039;s quite straightforward around here: no special memories, you come with your original body and such. Take a break, enjoy the food, things like that.&quot; He shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right...” Twilight accepted the information, thinking. “Anything of note?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes: don&#039;t get between Urd and the TV, unless you want to get in a prank war with a goddess. Anyway, tell me about your Loop, I saw quite a lot here, but colored unicorns are a first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around as the noisy machines were apparently doing their work, under the frantic orders of an apparently young teenager. However, having known immortal beings even before awakening to the Loops, the unicorn knew better. Especially as the engineer who welcomed her in this dimension introduced said young girl as the Norn of the Future, which, according to the few things she heard from the older Loopers, was a full-blown Goddess, with a capital G.</p><p class="double">Which did not stop her from acting like a child as her older sister teased her during the measurements. The unicorn took a brief look at the electronic-covered helmet which was perfectly fitting her cranium and her own horn, and shifted positions.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nice flank,” commented the white-haired Norn of the Past.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh, thanks. I guess?&quot; Twilight replied, uneasily.</p><p class="double">&quot;I checked on Yggdrasil about your universe. Cutie Marks, they&#039;re called? That&#039;s cute! Everyone with a nice little brand on their flanks...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not worse than the ones on your face,” replied Twilight, pointing her hoof at the sigils on Urd&#039;s face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ours are more... stylish.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you say so,” commented the unicorn before turning her attention to the younger goddess. &quot;So, what exactly are you measuring?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your dimensional signature, to have a precise fix on your original dimension,” answered Skuld without looking away from her computer. &quot;I have to be sure about your original timeline if we want to get this mess fixed one of these millenia.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Doesn&#039;t your &#039;Yggdrasil&#039; manage that already?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know precisely when you started looping. That&#039;s one of the problems with dimensions where time-travel is actually accessible to non-divine beings. So, since that you&#039;re the Anchor <i>and</i> a time-traveller of your own, I can get that information from you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,” said the purple unicorn while remembering her first experiment with time travel. &quot;Oops?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, &#039;oops&#039;,” said Urd. &quot;But she can probably deal with that. Emphasis on &#039;probably&#039;; she&#039;ll most likely need a helping hand from her nice older sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why would I need Belldandy for that?&quot; snarked back Skuld.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway,” said Urd while bringing her attention back to Twilight. &quot;Do you plan to stay here for a while?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If that&#039;s not intruding on you. And it depends how long &#039;for a while&#039; would last.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Long enough to meet humans unaware of magic, other dimensions and stuff,&quot; Urd said vaguely.</p><p class="double">&quot;Done!&quot; said the chilidish voice to her right, interrupting them.</p><p class="double">She felt the helmet release itself from her head, letting her mane free from its tight hold. At the same time, one of the doors opened itself, letting in the Norn of the present, followed by Keiichi. Twilight felt the urge to bow her head to the young woman whose pace and standing reminded her of Celestia, back in her home universe. Behind the appearances of youth and frailty were hidden power and kindness she could feel in every part of her body.</p><p class="double">The goddess was holding a plate filled with food while Keiichi, behind her, carried in his arms some mechanical contraption that reminded her of some of the Loops where Pinkie took the role of one of the Flim and Flam Brothers. When the plate was delicately left in front of her, she knew instantly that she would not eat more perfect food in a thousand loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;Err...,” began the engineer while nodding towards his device, &quot;I don&#039;t know if you need that, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you have... hooves. So, well, it may be difficult to eat and...&quot; Keiichi trailed off in a cloud of politeness.</p><p class="double">&quot;Keiichi-san wants to say that he designed this prosthesis to allow you to use sticks or other food ustensils if you want to,” Belldandy intervened helpfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me? You <i>designed</i> and <i>built</i> a prosthesis for a species you never saw before? In less than two hours?&quot; Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;... Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you sure that you are not a wizard of some kind yourself?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;As far as I know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Keiichi-san is very talented with machines,” the goddess said with a cheerful smile. &quot;He loves them and they love him back.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight though for a moment about simply using her telekinesis to take the sticks and start eating.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, why the hay not, after all?</i></p><p class="double">She held her front hooves forward, in a position allowing the engineer to fit his devices to them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The small prefab was, despite her initial expectations, as welcoming and full of life as her library tree could be back in Ponyville, albeit in a different way. While a few books, mostly technical and scientific, were left here and there, most of the internal space was taken by hundreds of tools, spare parts and the occasional vehicle, everything having some order beneath the apparent chaos.</p><p class="double">An order ruled by Keiichi&#039;s boss, Chihiro. Twilight heard her name spoken by the engineer, always with respect and even some kind of awe, sparking her own curiosity at someone who could inspire such feelings to a man whose instinctive grasp of mechanics was only surpassed by his theoretical understanding of the scientific principles behind every engine or device he owned.</p><p class="double">So she asked to see her, and Urd said a few seconds later that she would help, shoving a pill into her mouth.</p><p class="double">Thus her current human shape, with no extravagance beyond a small tattoo on her arm representing her cutie mark. It wasn’t exactly <i>normal¸</i> but at least it had hardly come at her cold.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, huh?&quot; said Chihiro as Keiichi left the workshop to deliver a freshly-repaired motorcycle to its owner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the newly human Anchor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Quite the meaningful name...,” commented the engineer before looking back at the engine in front of her. &quot;Could you give me the size 8 wrench, Twi&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; she answered before taking the right tool from the wall where it was fixed.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, how long will you stay in Nekomi?&quot; asked Chihiro while receiving the wrench.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure right now, but since Keiichi and Belldandy&#039;s... family are letting me stay at their home, I&#039;m trying to make myself useful around here.&quot; Twilight made a noncommittal gesture.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm, do you have any engineering training?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can work my way around a few things, but I&#039;m a scientist myself, not an engineer...” Twilight said apologetically, before adding “…but I&#039;m eager to learn.&quot;</p><p class="double">The owner of the &#039;Whirlwind&#039; workshop turned her head towards Twilight and examined her.</p><p class="double">&quot;What did Keiichi say?” she finally asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;That you&#039;d probably give me a chance to get some experience.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... of course he&#039;d say that.” Chihiro tapped her chin. “OK, here&#039;s what we&#039;re going to do: there&#039;s an old engine near the rear door, behind the shop. I want you to take it apart... nicely, and get as much spare parts as you can from it. And I expect you to tell me why you kept or threw away each part. That&#039;ll give me an idea of what you can do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you,&quot; answered Twilight. &quot;Can I use your tools?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t expect you to use your hands or magic!&quot; joked Chihiro. &quot;Make yourself some place inside so I can keep an eye on you while you do the job.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded and went outside to find the engine.</p><p class="double">Two hours later, the Anchor was still struggling with some parts, under the amused eye of Keiichi&#039;s boss and, as she went for another Allen key, asked her:</p><p class="double">&quot;Why isn&#039;t Keiichi back by now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh, the customer was quite far... and K will come near his home on his way back, so he&#039;s probably having lunch there and be back in half an hour or so.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, OK,&quot; answered Twilight while ignoring the feeling that she was forgetting something. &quot;So, how am I doing for now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that bad for a beginner,&quot; the mechanic commented. &quot;You have a knack for choosing the good tools, so that&#039;s good, but you don&#039;t have the experience and it shows in the order you&#039;re choosing the pieces to remove. But... I&#039;ll probably be able to get you in shape if you&#039;re willing to, and have the time, of course.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks a lot, I&#039;d appreciate it.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Some advanced engineering could really be useful back in Equestria. So many opportunities for pranking... and useful things too!</i> Thought the humanized unicorn with a smile, before going back to her previous chain of thoughts.<i> Anyway, what am I forgetting now...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, by the way, I couldn&#039;t help notice some of the textbooks on the shelves,&quot; she said, pointing to one of them. &quot;I didn&#039;t really expect some theoretical quantum physics in an automobile workshop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh? Nothing of interest here, just some reading for myself. There&#039;s always something else to learn, you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d never say anything else in a million years,&quot; answered Twilight.</p><p class="double"><i>And that&#039;s probably not a figure of speech.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, I&#039;ve got to finish this transmission and then we&#039;ll take a break to eat, OK?&quot; Chihiro said.</p><p class="double">&quot;As you wish, Chihiro.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight went back to her engine, struggling with a screw she couldn&#039;t get unstuck and, after a few minutes, sat on the ground, trying to think at another way of getting the job done. Her thoughts were however interrupted by Chihiro&#039;s voice:</p><p class="double">“Can I have the size 2 wrench, Twi?” the engineer asked without turning around.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” she answered, before using her horn&#039;s telekinesis to carry the wrench to Chihiro&#039;s open hand.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait a sec. My horn?</i></p><p class="double">Twilight put her hoof in front of her and realized she turned back into her original shape at some point during the past minute, without even noticing it as she was thinking about that damn screw.</p><p class="double"><i>Urd&#039;s shapeshifting pills had a limited duration! </i>That<i>&#039;s what I was forgetting!</i></p><p class="double">The surprise made her lose her grip over the wrench, which fell with a loud noise on the ground.</p><p class="double">She saw Chihiro turn her head towards the noise... and the purple unicorn now in her workshop.</p><p class="double">Twilight had an embarassed smile.</p><p class="double">Chihiro&#039;s eyes met hers.</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s a perfectly logical explanation...&quot; began the unicorn.</p><p class="double">Chihiro began twitching.</p><p class="double">&quot;Give me a few seconds to think about one...” she continued as she took back the wrench through her telekinesis.</p><p class="double">She, however, did not have those few seconds, as the engineer started yelling:</p><p class="double">CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Before Twilight had any time to react, the engineer was over her, hugging her.</p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Chihiro finally calmed down and stopped brushing Twilight&#039;s mane, the two of them sat near a table in front of each other:</p><p class="double">&quot;So...&quot; began the engineer. “You&#039;re not from around here, are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really. And you&#039;re taking it really well,” Twilight complimented.</p><p class="double">&quot;What? The fact that you are actually a magical purple unicorn with a recommendation from Keiichi?&quot; Chihiro shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, that,&quot; Twilight said, deadpan.</p><p class="double">&quot;Giving who he&#039;s living with, I find it difficult to be surprised anymore.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Twilight asked, suddenly curious. <i>She couldn’t mean…</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, please. He has two sentient robots living in his home, I&#039;ve seen quite the lightshows in the direction of his house, a speaking cat and... well...&quot;</p><p class="double">She took one book off its shelf and left it in front of Twilight so she could read its title:</p><p class="double">&quot;Norse Myths, Legends and Pantheon,&quot; she read aloud. &quot;Oh... it was obvious, wasn&#039;t it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty much.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But why haven&#039;t you spoken to him about it? Or with anyone else?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s his private life. Why should I get involved?” Chihiro shook her head. “He works well, his goddess of a girlfriend too when she comes here, so why should I get thing more complicated than they are. When he introduces me one of his &#039;foreign correspondants&#039;, I know I should expect some weirdness here and there, but he&#039;s some good judge of character overall, so if he tells me that you can learn something from me, why the hell not?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That was... unexpected.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Says the purple unicorn,” Chihiro snarked. “Anyway, who should I call to get that shaping problem fixed?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably Urd. Just a question... How long have you known about, well, all of that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Decades, probably more.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... What? You&#039;re a Looper too?&quot; Twilight asked, surprised.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not exactly,&quot; she answered. &quot;I asked one of your &#039;foreign correspondants&#039; friends about what was happening some time ago, and apparently, our proximity to Keiichi and the goddesses makes some memories about these &#039;Loops&#039; of yours leak back to us. Some unconscious thing, apparently, but that&#039;s fine too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So that&#039;s why you have advanced textbooks and everything, because you have had...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;More time, yes. And, well, that&#039;s probably required to keep up with Keiichi now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How so?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s just say that he&#039;s probably the most knowledgeable engineer on our world, now. So, when you&#039;ll be over with me, if you want some additional training, you should go and see him.&quot; Chihiro picked up the textbook and slotted it back into the shelf. “Now, where were we?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">9.10</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon burst into the building. “Tremble-”</p><p class="double">“Welcome back!” shouted a hundred voices, so loud together that they drowned out most of her first sentence.</p><p class="double">Chopping off her triumphant speech in favour of actually looking, Nightmare Moon blinked in shock.</p><p class="double">There was a big banner hung over the top of the room, reading ‘Welcome Back, Princess Luna!’ Every table was surrounded by ponies all looking at her, with broad grins instead of the fear she was expecting. And there were a dozen day guards at the walls, with <i>two</i> dozen guards in black armour… the night guards still existed?</p><p class="double">Nightmare was astonished. She’d thought her sister would instantly disband the Night Guards as punishment for her rebellion – if not execute them outright, in her darker moments.</p><p class="double">While she was thinking, the pegasi in black-and-purple armour had marched up to the area just below the stage. The two in the lead bowed.</p><p class="double">“Princess Luna, it is good to see you have returned to us. While our organization has dwindled until recently, we have maintained our traditions and wish to swear allegiance to you anew,” the one on the left said. He was the spitting image of her old, old friend, Sunshine…</p><p class="double">With a flash of internal guilt, Nightmare realized she hadn’t thought of her friends in a thousand years.</p><p class="double">Still, she concealed it admirably, and bowed to them in return. “My thanks…?”</p><p class="double">“I am Sunshine, of the line of your guards since time immemorial,” he answered. “Princess Celestia informed us you were returning, and authorized us to recruit back up to strength – and recommended this party, as a matter of fact.”</p><p class="double">Another crack opened in the layer of ice around Nightmare’s heart. This was not how she had imagined her return to Equestria going, but it felt… better. Cleaner.</p><p class="double">Every muscle in her body twitched as a warm feeling rubbed against her cheek.</p><p class="double">“It’s good to have you back, my dear sister,” Celestia said, nuzzling the other alicorn. “Would you like some cake?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare focused on the plate that hovered up to her. The cake on it was made with sponge, and smelt of bananas, and there was a hint of moonberry jam. It was covered with icing in the shape of her cutie mark. </p><p class="double"><i>Oh, buck it.</i></p><p class="double">“Yes, thank you.” Princess Luna said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Told you.”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded to her. “Yes, you did. I should have done this the first time.”</p><p class="double">“Though,” Twilight continued more seriously, watching as Luna took the oaths of her guards, “one of the main reasons this worked was because we know her so well now. Not just how she is normally, but how she thought as Nightmare Moon. And if it had gone wrong, there would have been a lot more ponies in the danger zone.”</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Sun nodded, accepting the point. “I am sometimes astonished by your growth, Twilight. Every time I see you, you’ve gained another few decades – or centuries, or even millennia – of experience. And I’m glad to have a Loop alone with you, so I can get to know you all over again.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shifted uncomfortably. “You know I’m not comfortable with praise…”</p><p class="double">“That is one of the very things that is praiseworthy.” Celestia nudged her. “Come on, I want to introduce Luna to you.”</p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>10.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…Friendship isn’t always easy. But it’s definitely worth fighting for!” Twilight finished.</p><p class="double">Beating Discord as per the first time was relatively unusual – but, well, it was nice to go along with things. Besides, she wanted to analyze how the corruption effect worked.</p><p class="double">The rainbow of light crashed down on Discord… and bounced off.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Discord shouted, materializing a guitar and playing a chord. “I knew it!”</p><p class="double">“Knew what?” Twilight asked, feeling a bit lost all of a sudden. The rest of the world was being fixed by the Elements, so they <i>were</i> still working…</p><p class="double">“Why, that the Elements of Harmony don’t work on someone who’s actually, genuinely good and redeemed!” Discord said, winking. “I’ll admit that they got me the first time, Twilight Sparkle, but not when I’m just pranking the lot of you.”</p><p class="double">“...oh. Well, welcome to the Loops, Discord.” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“Glad to be here.” Discord snapped his claws, and drinks materialized. “You’ve won an exclusive interview with the Spirit of Chaos! Someone get the Foal Free press. Or has that not formed yet?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia flashed into existence at the edge of Ponyville. “Well done, Twilight, and all of you, for defeating… Dis…cord?”</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” Discord said, as he passed the last of the cupcakes out. “That’s enough Generosity to be going on with. What’s next… oh, yes. Honesty! Oh, come and join us, Celly. Do let me know if I get anything wrong.”</p><p class="double">Celestia sank back on her haunches numbly. <i>What the hay…</i></p><p class="double">“Anyway. One of the moments that always sticks in my mind, with your <i>dear</i> ruler there, is when she was a little filly and tried to make her bedroom lamp brighter.”</p><p class="double">Celestia shook her head frantically. “Discord!”</p><p class="double">“What?” Discord looked over at her, pouring her a cup of tea. Sideways. “I’m hurt, I really am. Look at me being all honest. That’s an Element of Harmony, isn’t it? Anyway, she basically pulled a tiny bit of the sun into the bedroom lamp, it exploded, and her face was this hilarious sooty black colour for weeks! It took her months for her eyelashes to grow back!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“But that doesn’t make any sense!” Twilight said, pacing in front of Pinkie. “You can’t just… have physical reactions which predict the future! It causes an information paradox, which means… and… the whole… where does the party cannon… gaaaaah!”</p><p class="double">And then Twilight’s head exploded.</p><p class="double">There was surprisingly little blood, but a great deal of flame and smoke. Twilight’s body stood there with smoke pouring out of it, as Pinkie stared in shock.</p><p class="double">Then the library door opened, and Twilight came out. “Hi, Pinkie – oh, no. Not again.” Lifting up ‘her’ headless body, she began to carry it back inside. “Sorry. One of the experimental Twibots got out. I suppose I should have installed an extra safety valve…”</p><p class="double">Pinkie’s head swung between the unconcerned purple unicorn, and the blast scarring on the road. “…what?”</p><p class="double">“Experimental Twibots. I was trying to make them so that, in case one of us ever gets hurt, we can still activate the Elements.” Twilight indicated the body she was carrying. “Only thing is, I haven’t got them nearly good enough yet to even let them start learning about how their element works. Did you show off your Pinkie sense?”</p><p class="double">“…yeah,” Pinkie said, still a bit stunned.</p><p class="double">“That’ll be it.” Twilight nodded, pleased. “I’ll make sure to lower the gain on their cognitive engines. There’s some things it takes a <i>lot</i> more experience to understand.”</p><p class="double">Over where the robot Twilight had been standing, several large and heavy objects landed from a pegasus removal van.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “…girls,” Scootaloo began, “What <i>is</i> Diamond Tiara’s special talent?”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Sweetie frowned, thinking. “Bullying?”</p><p class="double">“But that’s not very relevant to a diamond tiara, is it?” Scootaloo said, still thinking. “I mean, you know all those talks we got from Twilight and Rarity and Appejack and Dash an’ stuff… how every cutie mark is worth somethin’?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded. “Right, an’ bullyin’ ain’t much of a talent, either.”</p><p class="double">“Wait.” Sweetie looked up. “I think I might have it. You know how she <i>never</i> admits she actually got something wrong?”</p><p class="double">The other two nodded.</p><p class="double">“Well, diamond is the hardest gemstone. Rarity told me that once.”</p><p class="double">“Just once?” Scootaloo snarked.</p><p class="double">“All right, probably more than once. But I remembered it that time.” Sweetie shrugged. “Anyway, I think she just won’t change her mind, or break, or anything.”</p><p class="double">“Too bad she’s stuck on jerk…” Applebloom muttered.</p><p class="double">“Actually, I wonder what <i>she</i> thinks her talent is,” Scootaloo said, “Maybe we should ask?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Oh, how tragic,” Diamond Tiara said as the Crusaders approached. “It’s the opposite of a jackpot. Triple blanks.”</p><p class="double">The Crusaders stopped, looking from one to another.</p><p class="double">“That was actually a pretty good one,” Sweetie said. “Seven?”</p><p class="double">“Eight.” Scootaloo countered.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Sweetie nodded. “Anyway. Diamond, we were wondering… what does your cutie mark represent?”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara blinked. “Er… it means… I’m daddy’s special princess!”</p><p class="double">“That’s more like <i>her</i> speed.” Scootaloo pointed up, where Princess Twilight – having ascended while handling Nightmare Moon for a change, this Loop – was flying to the shops. “You know. Alicorn.”</p><p class="double">“…oh.” Diamond frowned. “I… don’t actually know.”</p><p class="double">“Kin ah have a look?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“What?” Diamond Tiara tried to turn her flank away from them, which only revealed the other one. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Well, we’re tryin’ to work out how cutie marks work,” Applebloom continued, as Sweetie Belle snapped a picture with a camera she’d borrowed. “So we’re tryin’ to work out what they all mean. How’d you get yours?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that story didn’t make much sense,” Scootaloo muttered, “Why would Princess Celestia specifically send a letter to her dad saying his daughter was a nice filly? Especially if they’d never met.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. I kinda think she was makin’ it up.” Applebloom agreed. “Pity. It’d be nice to know how she <i>really</i> got her cutie mark.”</p><p class="double">“Aha!”</p><p class="double">The others turned to Sweetie. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well, it looks like most of the diamonds in her tiara are brilliant-cut. That means they’re the best kind of cut for a generic diamond. I can’t see any princess-cut gems, but this is the important one.” Sweetie pointed to the stone right at the middle of the cutie mark tiara. “That’s a well polished but <i>un</i>cut stone.”</p><p class="double">The others stared at her as though she’d grown a second head.</p><p class="double">“What? I helped Rarity for a couple of Loops.” Sweetie blushed. “Anyway. That means she might actually be – literally – a diamond in the rough. She’s just never had the chance – never faced the stress – that would let her shine.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rasied a hoof. “By stress, we’re talkin’, like, an alien invasion, right?”</p><p class="double">“Probably,” Sweetie giggled. “But it does mean something. She’s been too spoiled to develop her full potential.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Applebloom kicked the floor. “An’ now ah feel bad for her. Why did we have t’ do this, again?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Why are we here, again?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I don’t feel like dealing with Discord, so we are going to nip that in the bud right away,&quot; Twilight answered as they turned around another bush. &quot;Besides, this shouldn’t take... long...&quot; Twilight fell silent as they arrived at the place where Discords statue was supposed to be.</p><p class="double">Emphasis on <i>supposed to.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, looks like we have a looper,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;Well, this should be interesting.&quot; The group went inside to find Celestia and whatever trick Discord had set up, only to find a very confused Celestia reading a report.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, princess? We think...&quot; Twilight began before being cut-off by Celestia.</p><p class="double">&quot;That Discord has returned? Yes. Yes he has. Also, he is re-organizing our tax system to more efficient form and has cleared several our laws to be more streamlined and, oh yeah… he is <i>not acting like Discord</i>!&quot; The Sun Princess shouted. &quot;He is... not chaotic! He even organized the guard rotation to be clearer.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna walked out of a room next door and handed a cup of wine to Celestia, before taking a long snip from hers.</p><p class="double">&quot;He just looked over the workers union proposal and reformed it into the most efficient organization We have ever seen,&quot; Luna said, shaking her head. &quot;He is currently looking over our diplomatic relations.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Should we stop him?&quot; Twilight asked tentatively.</p><p class="double">&quot;That’s just it. We are not sure! On the one hoof… IT&#039;S DISCORD! On the other hoof, the entire system would be improved drastically by these changes! I can&#039;t decide!&quot; Celestia cried. Discord entered the room carrying another report.</p><p class="double">&quot;See, &#039;Tia, if you had replaced the old inherited nobility with &#039;Nobility through achievement&#039;, you could have reduced the deficit by 32% and increased the general happiness by 22%!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia stared at Discord as he explained in great detail, before simply taking the paper and leaving. Luna soon followed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re having too much fun,&quot; Twilight said to Discord, who had a crocodilian grin on his face. &quot;But isn&#039;t this against your nature?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? Randomly re-organizing the entire nation? Nah, I am merely being myself. I bet <i>you</i> never saw this one coming!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “TREMBLE IN FEAR, MORTAL!” Nightmare Moon shouted. “WHEREVER YOU ARE, WHEN I FIND YOU THEN I SHALL WREAK MY VENGEANCE!”</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Twilight said, frowning. “Mortal, singular?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Nightmare Moon’s voice was a bit less loud this time. “I, Nightmare Moon, noticed that for the last few years my Nightmare Night tribute from Ponyville has been <i>significantly lower than normal.</i>”</p><p class="double">Twilight realized that clearly Luna was Awake – either that or something was very wrong with the world – and decided to go along with it anyway. “Do you know why?”</p><p class="double">“I suspect.” Nightmare Moon walked down from the dais, casually batting away two guards with her wings. “I suspect that it is a pony who arrived here between three and five years ago, and one who has <i>far</i> too much of a taste for candy.” Her nostrils flared, as she sniffed. “There is one here who smells of sugar…”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie dove out the window.</p><p class="double">“AHA!” Nightmare Moon bellowed, launching herself into the air with powerful wing beats and following. “YOU SHALL GIVE ME RECOMPENSE, GLUTTON!”</p><p class="double">“Nevar!” Pinkie’s voice came from outside. “Whoops!”</p><p class="double">There was a crash.</p><p class="double">“DECOYING ME INTO A HOUSE IS NOT RECOMPENSE!” Nightmare Moon shouted, amid the crunch of falling masonry.</p><p class="double">Twilight trotted outside to watch. It was all very impressive, actually – while Pinkie wasn’t Awake, she was treating this as just as much of a game as Luna was, and kept tricking the alicorn into overshooting or hitting trees.</p><p class="double">After about twenty minutes, Celestia appeared in a flash of light. “Twilight! I heard that… what is going on?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “As I understand it, Nightmare Moon is annoyed that she wasn’t getting enough candy from Ponyville, and wants to get payback.”</p><p class="double">Celestia’s jaw dropped. “…you mean it actually worked? I thought it was an old mare’s tale!”</p><p class="double">“What, Nightmare Moon?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“No, Nightmare <i>Night</i>.” Celestia watched as Pinkie pulled off what could be best described as a Double Team, tricking Nightmare Moon into embedding herself into the floor. “I had hoped that a holiday where ponies spent their time outside, at night, enjoying themselves and enjoying scaring themselves, might help to convince her that her night was not truly neglected. I did not expect that the mythology that has grown up around it would be… accurate. In every particular.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie dodged again, and then gasped as Nightmare Moon collided with Sugarcube corner. “Oh, no!”</p><p class="double">“AHA!” Nightmare Moon boomed. “SO THIS IS WHERE YOU’VE BEEN KEEPING IT!” The black alicorn emerged from the attic with a comically large bag labelled ‘candy’, and flew off towards the moon.</p><p class="double">“…what the <i>buck?</i>” Rainbow Dash managed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.6 (Mandemon)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, return to the castle. Carriages are waiting for you and others. Yes, I am Awake. So are they. Celestia.&quot;</p><p class="double">A short and precise letter, so unlike Celestia, Twilight noted. Had something happened? She had come to Ponyville in advance to set up things, but had noted that the others were Awake and thus she didn&#039;t really have anything to do. However, it was the day when Nightmare Moon would return and Twilight was slightly anxious to see whenever Luna was Awake or not. Lately, she had been Awake more often than previously and had made each appearance varied. The time she had appeared singing <i>Hello my baby </i>had been particularly funny. Twilight had never expected her to juggle all those instruments alone with magic.</p><p class="double">She was not surprised to see the carriage waiting for her, with the others already there. When Celestia really wanted something done, it was done. She remembered that one loop with that whole three way Pony-Zebra-Griffin war. It took less than a week for Celestia and Luna to smash two other nations. As it turned out, the problem was not having enough power to deal with problems, but in knowing how to solve problems without using a metaphorical hammer on them all.</p><p class="double">The group arrived at the Canterlot just as the night was falling. They noted that the place was rather full of nobles from pretty much everywhere – Celestia must be planning for something big. They were guided into the throne room, where Celestia was waiting for them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh good, you girls are here. Now, we just need to wait for one more pony and we are ready to proceed,&quot; Celestia said with a smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh? Who?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Right on cue, Nightmare Moon appeared right next to Celestia, rousing a shocked gasp from the gathered nobles. Just as quickly as she appeared, Luna also shed her Nightmare Moon appearance and assumed her normal one.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ew, icky stuff. I never get used to that.&quot; Luna said. &quot;Right, let&#039;s get this show on the road.&quot;</p><p class="double">Right on cue, both used their magic to induce Alicorn transformations in all six Element bearers, confusing pretty much every pony in the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, so here is the deal. Me and my sister here, we are kinda tired of this, so we are holding a vacation. Every single petty argument or whatever you suckers have, these six will deal with it. We are going to go and relax. Ciao!&quot; Celestia said with a smile, before teleporting away alongside Luna. She reappeared five seconds later, causing everyone to sigh. Of course their beloved Princess would not do anything like this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah, I am not joking. Also, you six, don&#039;t call us unless it&#039;s multiverse threatening stuff, okay? We <i>really</i> need this,&quot; Celestia said, and disappeared again.</p><p class="double">A stunned silence descended.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, surprise?&quot; Twilight said, with an embarrassed smile on her face.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “ATTENTION, PONIES!” Luna shouted, appearing above the Ponyville town hall an hour into the Nightmare Night celebrations. “I AM ON A DIET! PLEASE PAY TRIBUTE IN VEGETABLES!”</p><p class="double">Applejack and Carrot Top exchanged glances, then both started trotting to their respective homes to get their market stalls.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.8</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Hello, Princess!” Twilight said, stepping aside from the door. “It’s good to see you. I was wondering whether you’d come, since there was that meeting with dignitaries from Saddle Arabia.”</p><p class="double">Celestia paused. “What do you mean? I set it up so that they would be coming here. It is a diplomatic visit <i>by</i> them, not <i>to</i> them.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “I don’t know. I got a letter saying that you wouldn’t be able to make the magic show because of a need to visit another country.” <i>Which was a surprise, actually…</i> “I invited Luna and Cadence instead, and they both seemed very pleased by the idea.”</p><p class="double">A sky-blue unicorn went past, reading from one of Twilight’s notebooks. “Trixie sees… so that is the basis behind advanced manifoldic formation of friendship harmonics… oh!” The notebook closed with a snap, and Trixie swept her hat off her head in a bow. “Princess. I had not realized that you would be present as well as your sister and niece. You do me honour.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, you must be Trixie.” Celestia returned the bow. “Twilight told me that you had reconciled after a minor disagreement last year, though she did not tell me you were going to be a part of this display.”</p><p class="double">“Well, she was in the area,” Twilight said, nodding to a cart that was parked out near the back window of the library. “I didn’t realize until after I was told you were going to Saddle Arabia.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, about that.” Celestia frowned. “I don’t know why you think that – it certainly wasn’t in the letter I wrote… may I see the one you received?”</p><p class="double">Twilight passed it over readily. Truth be told, she wasn’t sure <i>why</i> Celestia had changed her plans this Loop, but had assumed it was something to do with the newly Looping Trixie’s different behaviour. It was hard to tell what effect a change would have… but if she <i>hadn’t</i> in fact changed them, then it made no sense.</p><p class="double">“You are indeed correct. How strange.” Celestia shook her head. “While I confess I do not understand the reason for the altered correspondence, it was never my intent to miss your display – which I now understand will be a joint one. Since the Saddle Arabian diplomats should be arriving at some point, perhaps we shall just go ahead as scheduled.”</p><p class="double">“Works for me.” Twilight opened another of her notebooks, and held it out for Trixie. “What about one of these to start with?”</p><p class="double">“A meteor swarm?” Trixie examined the magical formulae. “Very daring. I see it is something of a trust exercise – since the pony running the spell cannot also run the shield.”</p><p class="double">“Basically.” Twilight grinned. “Be an impressive opener, won’t it?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Trixie nodded her respect to Twilight. “You are clearly learning what Trixie has to teach you about showmareship, Twilight.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>“You</i> are Princess Celestia?” one of the Saddle Arabian emirs asked, blinking at the figure in front of them. “You do not look very much like a pony...”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Discord replied, adjusting his fake wig and dress and keeping his voice to a falsetto, “We pride Ourself on an egalitarian nation, where any may be whatever she or he desires.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Most impressive, both of you.” Luna said to the two panting unicorns after nearly six solid hours of magical pyrotechnics. “I had not known half of those spells were possible.”</p><p class="double">“Neither did Trixie…” Trixie muttered. “She has learned much… er, I mean, <i>I</i> have learned much from Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Luna turned to Celestia. “Why so worried, sister?”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know why those diplomats didn’t turn up. It’s such a shame, they would have found that <i>very</i> impressive…” Celestia fretted. “I can’t help thinking something went very wrong…”</p><p class="double">A scroll materialized next to her. Twilight automatically caught it, then relinquished it to Celestia who opened it.</p><p class="double">“Let’s see… oh dear… ‘Dear Celly. Sorry for messing with your letters, I wanted a holiday. Don’t worry, I’m not evil any more… much… but it’s just so boring staring at hedges the whole time. Anyway, the Saddle Arabians loved me. Apparently I’m very good at belly dancing, who knew? I should have known I had a hidden talent. So, long story short, you’ve got all the agreements you wanted and then some, but they think I’m you. I look lovely in a dress. Paradoxically yours, Discord.’” Celestia put the letter down, and breathed deeply. In, out. In…</p><p class="double">“HE DID WHAT?!”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Twilight muttered to Trixie, “That’s one way to cause chaos.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Trixie blinked. “Him too?”</p><p class="double">“Occasionally. It’s just so hard to <i>tell</i>, with him…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.9 (Madfish): Fluttershy and Rush (offshoot of 40K Loop)</p><p class="double">(this first few paragraphs is a repeat from earlier, just to remind people where we are.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy walked among the drifts of the freezing valleys she found herself on at the start of the loop. She had had to restore her alicorn status just to survive the frozen wasteland and though the weather was harsher than any other. She could have allowed her self to die and end the loop for herself but if the other&#039;s were here somewhere they would need her help given the few times she had tried a spell beyond telekinesis she had felt sick as if monsters had tried to climb through her horn into her skull. Besides she owed it to her current companions mother to make sure they grew up big and strong first.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hope Twilight&#039;s going to be ok,&quot; she said to the wolves beside her, &quot;Without her magic she gets- twitchy....&quot;</p><p class="double">She trailed of as one of the wolves, a cub but larger than her pegasus self, drew her attention to a light flickering in the distance. Light&#039;s meant people, hopefully friendly people.</p><p class="double">As they approached she found herself disappointed as all that was there was some sort of pod covered with ice. Scraping the ice of the hatch she gasped as she saw the child within.</p><p class="double">The wolves panted, breath frosting in the air as they looked in at what had surprised there surrogate mother.</p><p class="double">&quot;No! You can&#039;t eat him. We&#039;re going to take this pod to shelter and we&#039;re going to help the poor dear. If no one comes for him you can think of him as you&#039;re new little brother.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Emperor stood over the unconscious form of his son. Victorious in battle, as he had not been in feasting, he turned, letting those around stare at his mighty form and their fallen King. It was good to see that these people were strong. They mastered their world and its beasts, as the mighty wolves with the guards and strange winged equine creature his son kept as a pet attested.</p><p class="double">The time for asserting his victory done, he turned back to reach down and pick his son up – only to be stymied. He found himself staring into the yellow creatures’ eyes and felt its will slam into his own. Now the Emperor knew himself to be the most powerful psyker in the galaxy – but, while it takes great will to wield such power, that power is not in itself will. So, taken by surprise, he found himself frozen under its stare as the Creature had the gall to start to <i>lecture</i> him!</p><p class="double">&quot;How dare you! How <i>dare</i> you!&quot; The Creature raged, &quot;My Son freely invites you into his hall and even when you lost your challenge he gave you your request of victory for the second, you spit on his generosity and hospitality then strike him down by bringing an artifact of power to a duel of honour! What do you...?”</p><p class="double">The would be Unifier of Humanity tuned out the Xeno&#039;s speech as he began to reassert his will as his own master. Only surprise had stayed his hand that long, and though he felt the force of the Xeno&#039;s attack strengthen enough to slow his limb it would not be enough to save it from being crushed under the force of his glove&#039;s powerfield.</p><p class="double">Sometimes a fraction of a second is enough, though, and a sliver of time before he connected his chin was met by the rising Russ&#039; fist throwing him back to the Great Hall&#039;s doors.</p><p class="double">&quot;You eat my food, drink my drink, then insult my household and try to kill my Mother. Let’s see how you do in a fair fight!&quot; With that Russ gestured and the two greatest wolves in the hall were at his side, one presenting him with his axe and the other with a shield.</p><p class="double">Even from the door and with his brains rattled the Leader of Mankind could feel the touch of the warp on them. Apparently bringing his son home would be more difficult than he&#039;d expected.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy had learned many hard lessons in this loop; She had learned that despite her talent and the abilities she had gained through the loops some creatures could not be reasoned with, she had learned to be a good mother making sure her charges were safe and able to grow in a harsh environment, she had learned of a deep abiding pride when her sons had brought the wolves and humans of this planet together uniting them for survival and protection as a greater whole.</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought I was stronger now,&quot; she thought as she shivered. The fear she had conquered centuries ago rekindled by near death, the implacable, disturbing eyes she had looked into and the sheer power she witnessed there. The sound of battle and the barking of wolves carried into the hall as the people within looked out to what she couldn&#039;t see. A few of them began brushing her mane to try and offer comfort.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why can&#039;t I help? I&#039;m not strong like Twilight.&quot; The sound of what could only be a building collapsing made her flinch. Her son needed her and she was so weak that she was just lying down, shivering, like she always did.</p><p class="double">&quot;But I wasn&#039;t strong when I went into the Everfree that first time.... or when I faced the Dragon... but they needed me... no… I <i>was</i> strong, <i>because</i> they needed me!&quot;</p><p class="double">She took flight with a speed that was distinctly atypical of her, kicking open the hall shutters to avoid the battle outside. Glancing down as she made for the clouds she saw her little Leman charge out of a pile of rubble and hook the man&#039;s artifact gauntlet out to the side with his axe. Geri took the opening and leapt, teeth scoring his armoured shoulder to little apparent effect, before he was grabbed and swung bodily at Leman to break their mutual weapon lock.</p><p class="double">Reaching the clouds, she wove an illusion to hide her actions and began to work them vigorously. &quot;I might not be Rainbow Dash, but if Applejack can do this then I can too!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;It seems, my Son, you&#039;ve been abandoned! Like humanity ever is by the xeno when comes their time of need.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She would never abandon me! It was she that taught me of Loyalty and Kindness on this harsh world. She took me in and made sure neither myself nor my brothers starved. With her teachings all of my Pack have prospered!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And yet she is gone.&quot; Punching Leman&#039;s shield squarely in the centre, sending the Primarch flying, he turned his back on him. The Emperor dealt Freki a viscous kick to the head, rendering the wolf insensate, while a gesture at Geri resulted in him flying over the surrounding buildings and out of sight.</p><p class="double">With a berserker roar Russ returned to the fight hewing and chopping at air as the man before him skilfully evaded each strike, watching the rage in Leman&#039;s eyes build.</p><p class="double">&quot;I find myself disappointed. I have searched the galaxy for my stolen son, and I find that he sacrifices his skill for rage so easily.&quot; So saying he grabbed the haft of the axe swung at him and wrenched hard to break his berserking son&#039;s grip, familiar from a hundred battles against Chaos with the madness he saw before him. So he was understandably surprised to have misread the King of the Russ when Leman abruptly released both axe and rage and rammed the edge of his shield around his guard, aiming for his throat with all the skill that he&#039;d apparently abandoned.</p><p class="double">The Emperor jumped back, sparing himself, but the power feeds to his glove were severed as he brought it up to shield himself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps you are a worthy son after all!&quot; He crowed with a smile, before he frowned seriously, &quot;But we have much to discuss – as fun as these games have been.&quot;</p><p class="double">Like Feni before him Russ was lifted into the air but instead of being launched away he was kept pinned to nothing as the Emperor began to talk.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hidden above Fluttershy’s illusion of stratocumulus, the clouds churned, transformed by her magic into a roiling charged mass. She carefully opened a gap in the illusion and saw Leman held aloft far below. Her reservations were put aside as she flew higher and higher straining to keep her telekinesis caressing the massive cloud bank below. Inverting herself she took a deep breath of the rarefied air and allowed herself to plummet.</p><p class="double">Flap.</p><p class="double">She aimed for her gap.</p><p class="double">Flap. &quot;I&#039;ll-&quot;</p><p class="double">She sped up.</p><p class="double">Flap.</p><p class="double">Her telekinesis firmed and began closing the gap and pushing the cloud bank down, creating a funnel.</p><p class="double">Flap. &quot;Not-&quot;</p><p class="double">She neared the wall.</p><p class="double">Flap.</p><p class="double">She was through the closing gap.</p><p class="double">Flap. &quot;Let-&quot;</p><p class="double">Telekinesis pulled the clouds into contact with her tail.</p><p class="double">Flap.</p><p class="double">She flooded the clouds with her pegasus magic and pulled them faster.</p><p class="double">Flap. &quot;You-&quot;</p><p class="double">Nearly.</p><p class="double">Flap.</p><p class="double">The-</p><p class="double">Flap. &quot;Down-&quot;</p><p class="double">-re.</p><p class="double">FLAP.</p><p class="double">Her acceleration soared as her body plummeted. Her sons&#039; attacker beginning to look up at the funnel of storm clouds trailing her and the clearing skies as her illusion shattered.</p><p class="double">FLAP! &quot;Ever-&quot;</p><p class="double">Straining to bring her tail past her hooves as she tucked her legs.</p><p class="double"><i>FLAP!</i></p><p class="double"><b><i>BOOM!</i></b></p><p class="double">Through the wall she watched as Russ fell and was dragged away by Geri, as the man raised some form of shield spell.</p><p class="double"><b><i>FLAP!</i></b> &quot;Again!&quot;</p><p class="double">Releasing the clouds she twisted to the side and bucked the the cloud funnel still moving down as hard as she could.</p><p class="double"><b><i>KRACKKK!</i></b></p><p class="double">Lightning crawled across the funnel like the biggest plasma globe in the universe, then lanced down at the God Emperor of Mankind with the precision of a sniper and the force of a lance barrage.</p><p class="double">Then the world was silent. And down from above came a yellow alicorn, her unconscious form spinning like a falling sycamore seed, a few tattered wisps of cloud catching round her like a torn parachute.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...did you see that?&quot; Bjorn the Fell-handed asked. &quot;I never thought someone would beat the little mother, or Russ!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Grimbold the Aethling chuckled, &quot;I don&#039;t think our <i>guest</i> thought they were that strong either. Look, he&#039;s out too!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A draw, by Fenrir!&quot; Bjorn called. &quot;Only a draw gives both sides full honour!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, give over,&quot; one of the clanners said, gesturing at a wolf that was looking at Fluttershy. &quot;They&#039;ll be fine in the morning.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To lord Russ and the little mother!&quot; Grimbold raised his horn.</p><p class="double">Freyja Hearth-Mistress&#039; snort could be heard over raucous cheering of the menfolk. &quot;Honour implies our &#039;guest&#039;,&quot; a word she spat like cursed Winter, &quot;has some to regain. You saw him try and strike down our Little Mother when she justly chastised the lout. He&#039;s already shown his colours. He can stay in the stables, for I won&#039;t have him under our roof till our King is well.&quot;</p><p class="double">From beside her a huge wolf bitch growled.</p><p class="double">Freyja nodded, &quot;You&#039;re right. I wouldn&#039;t trust him near the kennels with the pups either. Bring them into the Hall for now and we&#039;ll all keep watch over them.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">10.10 (Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So girls, who gets to choose how to deal with Nightmare Moon this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah think it&#039;s Fluttershy&#039;s, ain&#039;t it Pinkie?&quot; Applejack offered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep,&quot; Pinkie Pie confirmed.</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus blinked. &quot;In that case... Twilight, do you have that thing I asked you to keep that human loop? The one we wrote the thank-you letter?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle grinned. &quot;I like what you&#039;re thinking.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled. &quot;Yes, I want to try some other magic than the Elements of Harmony to see if we can break Princess Luna out of Nightmare Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds like a plan. Hang on, girls,&quot; and concentrating her magic Twilight teleported them all to Canterlot Royal Library.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, dear, when did you learn to use magic without flaring your horn?&quot; Rarity asked, surprised.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that?&quot; Twilight answered, sightly flustered. &quot;One loop I worked at Ponyville Hospital. And my horn is still flaring, it&#039;s just the light isn&#039;t visible. I had the conversion spell up because-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How comes the light isn&#039;t visible?!&quot; Rainbow Dash countered. &quot;Light is light, if there&#039;s light you can see it, if there isn&#039;t it&#039;s dark.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;SHHHH!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">Rainbow quickly looked around with a panicked look on her face.</p><p class="double">Twilight whispered in response &quot;Keep it down Rainbow! We are in a library.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops, sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight continued explaining &quot;Anyway, it’s like the X-Rays they use to check broken bones. You can&#039;t see light but-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, egghead stuff.&quot; Rainbow Dash waved with one hoof, dismissing Twilight&#039;s words.</p><p class="double">Twilight just glared at Rainbow for a moment before returning to Rarity. &quot;Sorry for forgetting to tell you, but we are going to do this at nighttime and we don&#039;t want the Princesses getting distracted with a horn flaring in the dark if we want to put Fluttershy in the spotlight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded &quot;Makes sense to light only the most important part of the scenery to draw all the attention; which reminds me, are you going to be all right Fluttershy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... want to try this, so don&#039;t worry Rarity, I&#039;ll be fine.&quot; The yellow pegasus tried to reassure her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;All right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;However,&quot; Fluttershy added, &quot;I&#039;m going to need your help with Princess Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia was alone in Canterlot Castle&#039;s Royal Hall. She had dismissed the Royal Guard just after sunset with the justification that she needed to get ready for the Summer Sun Celebration ceremony in Ponyville. In reality, she was setting herself as a first line of defense against Nightmare Moon and as bait, should she fail, so her faithful student Twilight Sparkle could reclaim the Elements of Harmony.</p><p class="double">At some point her patience bore fruit, as she felt an intimately familiar magical presence attacking her. Dodging to one side, she found the figure she was waiting for in the royal throne.</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia,&quot; Nightmare Moon spat, as if it were the worst imaginable insult, &quot;we meet again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly Celestia felt a strange wave of magic pass through her. The sky had somehow lost part of its color, leaving it gray. Celestia tried her connection to the Sun, finding it farther from her control than ever. Was she beaten so easily? Had she failed in rescuing her sister? Why did Nightmare Moon look so surprised right now?</p><p class="double">Celestia didn&#039;t really have time to ponder such questions as she started hearing music, a soft and slow tune. Then suddenly a spot in the dark hall became illuminated, showing a yellow pegasus who seemed to look at both her and Nightmare Moon. After a while, and following the music, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG0miCM8l08" rel="nofollow">she started to sing.</a></p><p class="double"><i>Fate has been cruel and order unkind</i></p><p><i>How can I have sent you away?</i></p><p class="double">The pegasus had a soft voice, a nice match for the sad song she was singing.</p><p class="double"><i>The blame was my own; the punishment, yours</i></p><p><i>The harmony&#039;s silent today.</i></p><p class="double">Celestia felt... something, as if the song captured her own self <i>&#039;That song, could that be about...?&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><i>But into the stillness I&#039;ll bring you a song</i></p><p><i>And I will your company keep</i></p><p><i>Till your tired eyes and my lullabies</i></p><p><i>Have carried you softly to sleep</i></p><p class="double">Suddenly a white unicorn appeared by the side of the yellow pegasus, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waPvh7ehZ3Y" rel="nofollow">who continued singing</a> where the pegasus, who looked in the verge of tears, left.</p><p class="double"><i>Once did a pony who gleamed like the moon</i></p><p><i>Look out on her kingdom and sigh</i></p><p><i>Dejected she cried, &quot;Surely there is no pony</i></p><p><i>Who loves me, or finds any love in my night.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s face betrayed her bewilderment, as if the song affected both alicorns equally.</p><p class="double"><i>So great was her pain, she rose in rebellion</i></p><p><i>Against those who cared for her most.</i></p><p><i>She let the Nightmare fall on those she ruled</i></p><p><i>And threatened to grip them in permanent cold.</i></p><p class="double">It was only then when the pegasus resumed singing, now in a duet. Somehow Celestia knew the words of this unknown song even before they were sung by the ponies.</p><p class="double"><i>Lullay dear princess, goodnight sister mine</i></p><p><i>And rest now in moonlight&#039;s embrace</i></p><p><i>Bear up my lullaby, winds of the earth</i></p><p><i>Through cloud, and through sky, and through space</i></p><p><i>Carry the peace and the coolness of night</i></p><p><i>And carry my sorrow in kind</i></p><p><i>Sister, you&#039;re loved so much more than you know</i></p><p><i>Forgive me for being so blind</i></p><p class="double">The sky suddenly returned to its usual color, and Celestia realized there weren&#039;t just only other two ponies: they were six, including Twilight Sparkle! The ponies also started to move in a slow yet captivating choreography while their singing continued, the lyrics telling the simplest, yet truest, version Celestia had known of the long ago tragedy. The turning of her sister Luna into Nightmare Moon, and her banishment to the moon by Celestia&#039;s own hoof a millennia ago.</p><p class="double">After the second verse and a section of music without lyrics finished Celestia couldn&#039;t hold it anymore: with tears she only now noticed flowing, she started singing in conjunction with Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies and -- to her surprise -- Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double"><i>The years now before us fearful and unknown</i></p><p><i>I never imagined I&#039;d face them on my own</i></p><p><i>May these sunless seasons swiftly pass, I pray</i></p><p><i>I love you; I miss you all these miles away</i></p><p class="double">At this point everypony except the alicorns had stopped singing, but Celestia hardly realized it. She had only eyes and voice for Nightmare Moon, who was still singing and crying to a song which touched both of their souls, none daring to move for fear breaking what seemed an illusion.</p><p class="double"><i>May all your dreams be sweet tonight</i></p><p><i>Safe upon that bed above the lights</i></p><p><i>And know not of heartache, fear, nor, gloom</i></p><p><i>And when I dream, I&#039;ll fly away to meet you soon</i></p><p><i>Sleep, sleep, sleep...</i></p><p class="double">When the song ended Celestia felt expectant. Now what? After what appeared to be another thousand years Nightmare Moon closed her eyes and Celestia saw magic enveloping the darker alicorn. A moment later the magic vanished and it was Princess Luna who opened hers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia,&quot; Luna said in a cracking voice, &quot;we meet again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Only then both alicorns dared to move, this time to reach each other&#039;s embrace.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle tried to contain her tears, and her excitement. At least the reunion of the Princesses helped with the latter – but not with the former. During the musical number not only was she &quot;lightlessly&quot; casting a Dimensional Barrier to distract the Princesses and the music spell for the song Fluttershy found, but also she was taking care on observing how the song affected the Princesses.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s plan was a complete success: using what she dubbed &quot;heart-songs&quot;, the way ponies seemed to spontaneously inspire and create musicals, combined with a song specially tailored for the Princesses to dispel the corruption in Nightmare Moon. This time they didn&#039;t even need to use the Elements of Harmony or to become alicorns, and the best part of all: she had material for yet another Thesis!</p><p class="double">Drying her tears she rounded up her friends and started to leave. &quot;Princess Celestia, Princess Luna. Now we have to go to finish the preparations of the Summer Sun celebration in Ponyville. We&#039;ll wait for you there.&quot; Celestia could only answer with a nod.</p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='11'></a><h3>Loops 11</h3>
<p>11.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p>The three Crusaders eagerly awaited the arrival of &#039;Nightmare Moon&#039;. Twilight had agreed to let them handle her appearance this loop. Luna wasn&#039;t awake, but that would be part of the fun.</p><p class="double">Ah, here she was.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my beloved subjects. It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve seen your precious, little, sun-loving faces.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash wasn&#039;t awake, and did her usual non-awake attack run on Nightmare Moon, and was as usual stopped by the unawakened Applejack. &quot;What did you do to our princess?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon chuckled. &quot;Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don&#039;t you know who I am?&quot;</p><p class="double">Before Pinkie could guess, Applebloom stepped forward, and called out, &quot;You&#039;re Nightmare Moon! But you shouldn&#039;t be here for a couple of months yet!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am gratified that at least some-pony remembers the legend, but I have returned on the longest day of the thousandth year, as prophesied.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo stepped up beside Applebloom as she continued. &quot;So… you&#039;re not here for Nightmare Night?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Nightmare looked honestly confused. &quot;No, silly foal, I am here to bring the Night Eternal!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa!&quot; Applebloom exclaimed, &quot;Isn&#039;t that a bit steep for not getting enough candy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Candy? What is this &#039;Nightmare Night&#039; you speakest of?&quot;</p><p class="double">The trio inwardly grinned. They&#039;d seen Luna restored by talking before, and starting to speak ye olde butchered equestrian was one of the signs of her breaking through the Nightmare persona.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a night where we dress up and collect candy to offer to you so you don&#039;t eat pony fillies and colts,” Applebloom rattled off, with just a hint of nervousness.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon actually looked disgusted. &quot;Eat ponies? What calumnies hath my sister foisted on this world in my absence?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Told ya!&quot; Scootaloo nudged Applebloom as they&#039;d rehearsed.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle added, &quot;Well, nobody actually believes that bit, but it&#039;s a good scary story, and you&#039;re an awesome, scary pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thou wantest to be scared?&quot; Nightmare Moon was clearly all at sea… so they kept pushing out the boat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah! Scary can be fun when it&#039;s all just a game! Nightmare Night is one of my favourite days of the year,” Applebloom explained. “We get to dress up and stay up late and party all night, and get lots and lots of candy. And Nightmare Night wouldn&#039;t be Nightmare Night without Nightmare Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Nightmare turned to smoke and flew down to the three pony fillies, appearing right in front of them, a black aura and lightning crackling around her. &quot;Doth thou still think me a figure of fun?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoo!&quot; &quot;Cool!&quot; &quot;Do it again!&quot; The three fillies, rather than being intimidated, applauded her. A few other ponies started joining in, Pinkie chief among them.</p><p class="double">The Nightmare was taken aback. &quot;Thou art not terrified? Why doth no-pony get it? I am here to imprison my sister Princess Celestia, as she once imprisoned me in the moon, and bring eternal night! I know nothing of this Nightmare night you speak of!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle&#039;s lip quivered. &quot;Does that mean Nightmare Night is cancelled?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom asked, &quot;Your sister? Why would any-pony do something like that? Especially a sister. My sister Applejack and I are the closest of friends. She&#039;d never banish me to the moon for a thousand years, not even if i was really naughty. Well I guess she couldn&#039;t in the first place, not being an alicorn and all, but even if she could, she wouldn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon huffed. &quot;Very well, since it is clear no-pony understands how I was wronged, I shall have to explain. A thousand years ago, my sister and did work together as princesses of Equestria, she raising the sun and bringing the day, while I did raise the moon and brought the night as Princess Luna. But while ponies enjoyed my sister&#039;s day, they feared and shunned my beautiful night, sleeping through it. I ultimately resolved that I would make the night last forever, so they would have to appreciate it. But my sister managed to defeat me and locked me away in the moon for a thousand years.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That was really mean!&quot; Applebloom commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;It was the only way for ponies to see my night...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I mean ponies ignoring your night. Nights are cool too.&quot; Applebloom decided not to mention the whole ‘diurnal biology’ thing.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo continued, getting excited. &quot;Yeah, there are all kind of things you can do at night, like have sleepovers, or bonfires, or watch the stars... we even study them in school, and pegasi and ships use them to navigate by.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Or have a long romantic stroll and snuggle up together under the moon...&quot; Sweetie Belle sighed, eyes distant.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon shook her head from side to side as if trying to dislodge a fly, her mane wavering in colour. &quot;You no longer fear the night? But...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom pressed on. &quot;Of course, making it night forever was a bit of an over-reaction. I mean we need day too, to grow crops and stuff. Eternal night would mean every-pony would die of starvation, and then who&#039;d appreciate your night?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Nightmare&#039;s mane turned darker, then lighter, so Sweetie Belle added, &quot;But banishing you for a thousand years? That&#039;s kind of over-reacting too. My sister and I sometimes argue, but she&#039;s never given me a thousand year time out. But even though we argue sometimes, we&#039;re still sisters, and we still love each other. You should have been able to talk it through, work out some way that to get ponies to appreciate you more.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe they were just too mad at each other,&quot; Applebloom said, &quot;Even Applejack and I get mad at one another sometimes, and we say and do things we don&#039;t really mean. I&#039;m sure princess Celestia is sorry about what happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three ponies put their heads together and whispered, then pulled some sacks from under the table. Applebloom said, &quot;These were our special Summer Sun Celebration candy stashes, they took weeks to put together. If we give them to you, could you bring back Princess Celestia, and not do the whole eternal night thing, just talk with her and make up, maybe?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon looked incredulous and rose up on her hind hooves, mane flaring. &quot;You&#039;re kidding, right? Thou doth have the temerity to bargain with an alicorn princess, and more so you do offer sweetmeats as your prize?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo started looking through the bags. &quot;We don&#039;t have any temerity or sweetmeats, but we do have hard candy and chocolate and gummies and boiled sweets and even some cloud cupcakes....&quot;</p><p class="double">That utterly wrong footed her. She landed back on all fours, face scrunched up, and then bust out laughing. Not evil laughter, but a good honest belly laugh. The darkness in her mane flared and was blasted away, and her armour shattered. Her eyes turned from green and slitted to regular irises of a cyan blue, and after a few moments she recovered enough to speak.</p><p class="double">Very well, young fillies, we have a bargain.&quot; She raised her head and her horn flashed. The sun rose, and from its centre came a ball of light, which landed by her and resolved itself into Princess Celestia.</p><p class="double">Every-pony bowed. The elder alicorn blinked, looking around, and saw her sister standing in front of three fillies with a bag of sweets.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I… did not expect that…&quot; Celestia said, trying to work out how that had just happened. &quot;It seems I owe you three fillies a great debt of gratitude for freeing me and restoring my sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, it was nothing...&quot; Applebloom blushed.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle piped up. &quot;Yes, we know how sometimes things get out of hoof between sisters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t...&quot; Scootaloo sighed and looked meaningfully over at Rainbow Dash. &quot;I wish I did...&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia gave all three of them a gentle smile. &quot;My deepest thanks to all of you anyway. I wouldn&#039;t have considered it possible if I hadn&#039;t seen it myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed sister.&quot; Princess Luna added. She rubbed her forehead. &quot;They bargained for your freedom with words of wisdom and bags of candy. Now I do consider the matter, bringing eternal night just so ponies could appreciate my night sky was possibly the most idiotic idea since Romane Numerals. In truth, I can not imagine what I was thinking!&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia teared up. &quot;Oh Luna, it&#039;s been centuries since I&#039;ve seen you like this. I would have done anything to spare you your exile, but there was a taint of darkness in you, something foreign, and it twisted you. Working alone, I could not use the full power of the Elements and free you from it, so I had to freeze you in the moon until I could find a way to separate you from it. I thought only the full power of the Elements of Harmony could do it, and using them the way i did even at lower power would ruin them for centuries, so I gave myself a millenium to find an answer and for the Elements to recover. If I had known the answer was so simple...&quot;</p><p class="double">She moved in and hugged the startled Luna. &quot;I have been so lonely these past thousand years! We were meant to rule together little sister. Will you accept my apology, and my friendship?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna hesitated for a moment, then returned the hug. &quot;Only if you will accept mine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Many joyful tears were shed, then Pinkie Pie exclaimed, &quot;This calls for a party!&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies gave each other a big grin and high hooved. &quot;Cutie Mark Crusader Diarchy Restorers! Yeah!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">11.2</p><p><hr></p><p>“Your majesty?”</p><p class="double">Mufasa, ruler of the Pride Lands, turned. “What is it, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">The shaman (well, this Loop anyway) spread her hooves. “I do not have anything definite, but I suspect that your brother may be planning something.”</p><p class="double">“Scar?” Mufasa frowned. “Why do you suspect that?”</p><p class="double">“A number of reasons, some of them too arcane to be understood.” <i>Well, yeah,</i> Twilight thought, <i>as in, I’ve watched the film.</i> “But I think there are things that could be done to mitigate what might happen.”</p><p class="double">The lion began pacing down the side of Pride Rock, following his zebra shaman. (Twilight had been intrigued to discover that the Loop had made her into a horned zebra, and that her cutie mark was more… tribal in design, for some reason.) “What do you suggest? I strike first?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Twilight shook her head emphatically. “I suggest that you begin a phased plan of increasing the opportunities available to hyena.”</p><p class="double">“…pardon?”</p><p class="double">“The lions, aside from Scar, are content with your rule. Most other predators on the plains are too small to pose a threat. It seems that the most likely source of power for any coup – not just one from Scar, if such is possible, but any – is the hyena, since they’re angry.” Twilight took some powder from a pouch – that Loop she’d spent learning from Zecora was coming in <i>very </i>useful – and cast it into the air.</p><p class="double">She manipulated the bound spell in the powder to show what she wanted it to show. Shanzi, Banzai and Ed, prowling through the Elephant Graveyard.</p><p class="double">“See, my liege?” she said, pointing. “They are gaunt with hunger – not starving, certainly, but nor are they able to eat their fill.”</p><p class="double">“This bears consideration.” Mufasa frowned. “Thank you, my shaman. Continue your work.”</p><p class="double">It was as good as a dismissal.</p><p><hr></p><p>“You know, there’s only one thing I wanna know,” a boar said, pausing in his meal.</p><p class="double">“What’s that?” his companion asked.</p><p class="double">“Why are you a meerkat?”</p><p class="double">Angel frowned. “Why not?”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged. “I dunno. Just seemed like you’d be... well, something more rabbity. And how come you’re Looping anyway?”</p><p class="double">Angel copied the shrug. “Like I care. Pity Fluttershy isn’t around, though.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“So, what you’re saying is…” Shanzi paced, her two packmates circling further out, “…that if we do what Mufasa says, he’ll let us have his scraps?”</p><p class="double">“Rather more than scraps,” Twilight replied. “Anyway, why are you following Scar? Doesn’t he offer basically the same thing but with more effort?”</p><p class="double">She blinked. “For that matter, aren’t you matriarchal?”</p><p class="double">“Eh.” Banzai padded closer. “She doesn’t tell me what to-awp!”</p><p class="double">Shanzi lowered her paw from the cuff that had sent him sprawling. “<i>Yes. I. Do.</i> Anyway, it is an interesting offer, but there’s one problem.”</p><p class="double">“And that is?” Twilight asked politely.</p><p class="double">“We could just eat <i>you</i>, right <i>now.</i>” Shanzi nodded sharply, and Ed leapt at Twilight from behind.</p><p class="double">There was a <i>pop</i>, and he landed on Shanzi’s face.</p><p class="double">“Argh! Gerrof, idiot! I said <i>gerrof</i>, I’m not a zebra, oow!”</p><p class="double">“I’ll speak to you later,” Twilight told Banzai (the only one currently listening) and vanished in a magical flare.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">11.3</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, here we go!” Applebloom said. “You ready, Scoots?”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo nodded from the cockpit of a credible imitation of a Sopwith Camel. “Ready!”</p><p class="double">“Okay!” Applebloom bucked the propeller, and the engine sputtered once or twice before catching and starting to run properly.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo waited a moment, then nodded again. “Looks good.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom ran back to the left wheel, took a string attached to the left chock in her mouth and hurried over to the outer edge of the lower left wing. Once there, she fitted herself under it. “Mfree, Twmmf, Mmne…”</p><p class="double">Sweetie pulled the right chock out at the same time Applebloom pulled on the string attached to the left one. They both started running forwards, holding up the wings as the biplane got moving. Once it was faster than they could run, they slowed down and watched.</p><p class="double">The biplane bumped over the ground, accelerating, and began to jounce as it hit slight irregularities in the field. Once, twice… then it didn’t come down again.</p><p class="double">“Woo!” Applebloom shouted, jumping up and down, as the <i>Crusader I</i> climbed steadily into the air. Once it was a couple of hundred yards up, it banked slightly and began to circle as Scootaloo carefully gained height.</p><p class="double">“Well, it worked,” Sweetie said, watching with a grin on her face. “What next?”</p><p class="double">“Next, ah think we try for an improved version that don’t need two sets of wings.” Applebloom frowned, already thinking of other ways to make the <i>Crusader II</i> better. “Or we could try makin’ the wings outta wood, instead of bein’ fabric.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like a good idea.” Sweetie nodded. “I know Rarity is going to be amazed when she sees what we did with her waste bolts of cloth, though.”</p><p class="double">The airplane overhead waggled its wings, then dove gently. They could hear Scootaloo’s voice, faint over the engine.</p><p class="double">“This is <i>so cool!</i> I…”</p><p class="double">Applebloom didn’t catch the next bit. “What did she say, Sweets?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle lit her horn. “Sec… rewind… oh.”</p><p class="double">“What?”</p><p class="double">“That’s what she said.” Sweetie deadpanned. “She said ‘oh.’”</p><p class="double">The buzzing drone of the engine above cut out.</p><p class="double">“Ah, horsefeathers…” Applebloom muttered. “Must be the carburettor.”</p><p class="double">A large parasail opened overhead as Scootaloo bailed out. The <i>Crusader I</i> kept going without her in a gradually steepening dive, which ended as it hit the nearby lake with a huge splash.</p><p class="double">Sweetie slowed Scootaloo’s landing with telekinesis, and the pegasus stomped over to Applebloom.</p><p class="double">“I’ve got some issues with the design.” Scootaloo shook her hooves, which seemed to be wet. “The engine leaks.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom bent down and sniffed. “…yeah, that’s fuel alright. Guess a combustion engine wasn’t a good idea.”</p><p class="double">“You’re telling me?” Scootaloo pointed to the plume of smoke. “The fuel leaked into the cockpit, and then the engine cut out! That was <i>not</i> fun!”</p><p class="double">Sweetie looked smug.</p><p class="double">“Alright, alright, you win Sweets.” Applebloom kicked the ground. “We’ll build a crystal engine for the second one. Now, er… how do we explain this to Steven Magnet? I think the <i>Crusader I</i> hit his summer home.”</p><p class="double">“We have a <i>long</i> way to go before we can build a Mareitech…” Scootaloo shook her head.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">11.4</p><p><hr></p><p>“…okay,” Fluttershy said timidly. “I know I can become an alicorn now, but… I don’t really feel up to this…”</p><p class="double">Twilight finished establishing her stability bubble, pushing back the chaos of Discord-controlled Equestria with a variant failsafe spell. “Well, it seems to happen every time somepony ascends. Well, except me… I did have a Loop where I replaced Luna, but that wasn’t straight after my ascension… anyway. We have to deal with Discord.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Fluttershy’s face set. “I can handle this, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Good.” Twilight tapped a hoof. “I get Magic, you get Kindness… which two other Elements do you feel up to?”</p><p class="double">“No, <i>I</i> can handle this.” Fluttershy flew off.</p><p class="double">“…huh.” Twilight said. “That’s unusually bold for Fluttershy.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“…so, anyway, the point <i>is</i>, I just don’t see the upside of harmony for me.” Discord lay back on the couch he’d conjured. “I mean, I’m a being of chaos and disharmony. Harmony is sort of opposite of me.”</p><p class="double">“Perhaps you just haven’t had the right examples,” Fluttershy replied. “I mean, take as an example what happened with the Windigoes. Alone, the three tribes were completely unable to resist their effects – but together, they were much more powerful. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, you see…”</p><p class="double">“Fair point,” Discord allowed. “What do you suggest <i>I</i> would enjoy, then?”</p><p class="double">“Well, my –sister,” Fluttershy said, remembering just in time what was going on this Loop, “is quite an expert with magic. I’m sure she’d love to work with you. And I can tell that you’re quite a fun draconequus to be around – if you can resist turning ponies into things they’d rather not be, at any rate.”</p><p class="double">“A difficult challenge,” Discord said airily. “I’d much rather do a bit of… discordianism.” He snapped his fingers, and tapped Fluttershy on the forehead just below her horn. “Let’s see what you think now!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blinked, and frowned. There was a burst of magic which bowled Discord over.</p><p class="double">“<i>You have been a very naughty boy!</i>”</p><p class="double">“…this feels like Karma,” Discord said. “I don’t like it.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“…I said I was sorry,” Discord muttered.</p><p class="double">Next to him, Fluttershy’s wings twitched. She could have been shrugging slightly – it was hard to tell.</p><p class="double">“Though I <i>am</i> impressed with your sister,” the draconequus continued. “I mean, she tried working with you instead of against you for nearly a year after you kicked me up here.” He pointed to the crater he’d left when he hit the moon. “Nice shot, by the way. Anyway, what finally got too much for her?”</p><p class="double">“…wolves.”</p><p class="double">“Pardon?” Discord bent down.</p><p class="double">“I set Canis Major on the castle!” Fluttershy shouted. Discord went flying backwards from the sheer force.</p><p class="double">“I don’t know what you did to me,” Fluttershy continued, shaking her head. “I keep getting <i>angry</i> so easily, and for no reason! I… I thought she wasn’t putting enough effort into zoological funding, and so I decided to use my part of the gardens to take care of a few animals, and by the time I’d finished putting all the rest of them in there it filled the Everfree forest, and I didn’t have anywhere to put the Canis Major, so… I got them to invade Twilight’s part of the castle, to show her why she should respect our little friends.” By this point, Fluttershy was hiding herself almost entirely inside her wings. Only her horn and eyes were poking out.</p><p class="double">Discord whistled. “That’s actually quite impressive.”</p><p class="double">The two divine entities sat awkwardly for a bit.</p><p class="double">“…can you make a sauna?” Fluttershy asked tentatively.</p><p class="double">“That sounds like a good idea,” Discord replied. “Water, grape juice, or key lime pie?”</p><p class="double">“Water, please.” Fluttershy paused. “Can it be lemon scented?”</p><p class="double">“I can make it fizzy, too!” Discord replied with a grin.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Stupid things!” Twilight said, barely restraining the urge to kick the Element of Loyalty. “I wanted to undo whatever Discord did to destabilize her moods, not send her up there for a thousand years!”</p><p class="double">She sighed. “Oh, well. Looks like it’s going to be waiting until our friends turn up again…”</p><p><hr></p><p>“You want me to organize a welcome home party?” Pinkie Pie, special student of (a <i>very</i> tired) Princess Twilight asked with glee.</p><p class="double">“Yes, Pinkie.” Twilight massaged her temples with her forehooves. “There are two deities up on the moon who are going to be coming back down in a month or so. Neither of them is actually evil, or nasty, they were just… put in time out. I’d like you to make it clear to them that they’re welcome in Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“Okay!” Pinkie said, bouncing. “Who are they?”</p><p class="double">“One of them is Discord.” Twilight paused. “Just design a party for yourself, for him, only more so. The other one is my sister, Princess Fluttershy. She’s very sweet, and likes things subdued… but she does have a bit of a temper, so make sure things are done well.”</p><p class="double">“Okie Dokie!” Pinkie bounced off.</p><p class="double">Twilight let out a heartfelt sigh of relief. Pinkie Pie was a true friend, but not to be taken in extended doses.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Okay, Spike!” Pinkie said. “How’s things going on the Discord side?”</p><p class="double">“Well, we’ve got all the local ponies who are into intensive partying lined up.” Spike turned a page on the clipboard. “One ‘Rainbow Dash’ has said she’ll do her speciality piece to open the disco, and there’s a DJ who’s going to keep it going.” The young dragon frowned at the paper. “DJ Lunacy? Whatever. Anyway, that was the last thing left to handle.”</p><p class="double">“They sound fun!” Pinkie nodded to herself. “I’ll go see them in a moment! What about the other side?”</p><p class="double">“One Octavia is going to do the music for that one. All classical, nothing too startling. There’s also a pegasus dance troupe who’ve volunteered to help… Cirque du Celestia? Sounds interesting. They’re supposed to be very good. Anyway, a very nice – very, very nice – unicorn called Rarity is helping to outfit everypony for that, all in period dresses and suits to add a touch of the familiar for her.” Spike looked a bit distracted by the subject of said unicorn, but rallied quite well. “And the catering’s lined up too.”</p><p class="double">“Good!” Pinkie said. “Now to let Princess Twilight know! Get that flame ready, Spike!”</p><p><hr></p><p>“…huh.” Twilight muttered, reading the letter. “Luna’s a <i>DJ</i> this time? I have to admit, given nightclubs, it makes a certain amount of sense…”</p><p><hr></p><p>“It started well!” Pinkie said brightly, looking over the smoking ruins of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“I believe you,” Princess Twilight replied. “I was there. But I didn’t see where it went <i>wrong.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Pinkie thought. “I think it was about when Luna overloaded the spell that was maintaining a sound barrier between the two parties, deafened everypony at the soiree, and startled Princess Fluttershy.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight spread her wings. “I’ll go look for my sister, she’s probably in the Everfree somewhere. You try and find Discord.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Don’t worry, Fluttershy,” Twilight said. “Nopony actually got hurt.”</p><p class="double">“I just feel like I keep breaking things!” Fluttershy wailed. “I’m not cut out for being an alicorn!”</p><p class="double">“No, you’re doing better than almost anypony else has…” Twilight said critically, thinking back on ‘Danger Dash’. “You coped with the moon very well. Besides, it seems like being an alicorn actually makes emotional extremes stronger. You weren’t ready for it – that’s all.”</p><p class="double">She stretched out a wing, and laid it over Fluttershy’s back. “Come on. Besides, Luna and Dash both had their episodes last a thousand years. Yours tend to be a lot shorter.” Twilight pondered for a moment, trying to think of something to say.</p><p class="double">“…I found Angel Bunny.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy’s eye peeked out of her wings. “You did?”</p><p class="double">“Yep. He actually runs the griffin empire, for some reason. Strangest trade agreement signing I’ve done yet.” Twilight considered that statement. “Well, apart from the one from last Loop, where we agreed to trade love to the Changelings. Actually, speaking of them, I normalized relations five hundred years ago. Want to see if Chrysalis can help you with that emotions problem? There’s a state visit next month.”</p><p class="double">“…alright, then,” Fluttershy whispered.</p><p><hr></p><p>11.5</p><p><hr></p><p>“THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!” Nightmare Moon shouted, glorying in her own return.</p><p class="double">“Really?” A suspiciously familiar voice asked. “Hel<i>lo?</i> <i>So</i> consistent.”</p><p class="double">“Discord?”</p><p class="double">“How did you <i>know</i>, lulu?” Discord raised an empty glass, then quaffed the air in it. Mead flowed in from nowhere to fill it up from the top, and when he finished the glass was completely full with liquid that didn’t spill. Picking up an empty bottle on the table, he ‘emptied’ his glass from it. “But I don’t like the idea of the night lasting <i>forever</i>. I mean, it’d get boring inside three minutes.”</p><p class="double">“Night and day are irrelevant!” The mayor shimmered, and turned into a large, insectoid creature. “Changelings! Sieze them!”</p><p class="double">Almost every other pony in the room also dropped shapeshifts.</p><p class="double">“We cannot allow them to jeapordize our infiltration!” Chrysalis said.</p><p class="double">There was a knocking on the door. All three divine entities paused, looking towards it.</p><p class="double">After almost a full twenty seconds of staring, Discord sighed and snapped his fingers. The door opened.</p><p class="double">A large, armoured unicorn stepped through. <b>“Crystals?”</b></p><p><hr></p><p>“Ooooh…” several dozen ponies said, watching the fountain of magical backlash as four immensely powerful beings battled hammer-and-tongs.</p><p class="double">“Aaaaah…”</p><p class="double">A Changeling went soaring into the air, clinging grimly to a large firework labelled ‘Komodo 3000.’</p><p class="double">“Hey, Pinkie…” Twilight began slowly. “Is that the one that-”</p><p class="double">“Duck and cover!” Pinkie overrode her, diving to the ground.</p><p class="double">There was an enormously bright flash, and night became day for about five seconds.</p><p class="double">“I told you not to store that in the town hall!” Twilight said, once the firework had finally burnt out. “Actually, I told you to store it in your pocket dimension inside a water-jacketed box.”</p><p class="double">“Eh.” Pinkie shrugged. “I wanted to see what Dissy would do with it!”</p><p class="double">A smouldering changeling landed next to them, stumbled upright and promptly collapsed again. “I can’t see!”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry,” Twilight replied. “The box said your eyesight comes back in two days.”</p><p class="double">“Are you <i>sure</i> this will solve all our problems, Twilight?” Princess Celestia asked, looking dubious.</p><p class="double">“Oh, yeah,” Twilight reassured her. “I mean, once they’re all tired enough we could probably actually talk them through things.”</p><p class="double">She winced as a bolt of pure night removed the top half of her library. “Granted, that could take a while…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Discord panted on the floor, utterly exhausted. There were three hundred changelings surrounding him, covered with various flavours of pie or jam, and one duct-taped expertly to the remains of the wall behind him.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis wasn’t much better. She was still standing, but visibly supporting herself with a table.</p><p class="double">Sombra had discovered that the goblets in the room were made with crystal glass and was busily trying to chew his way through some, mainly to get up the energy to move.</p><p class="double">And Nightmare Moon still had a spell sizzling on the end of her horn. Granted, it was a low grade stun spell, but it was more than the others could manage. “Hah! You, you… fools, you… foals, couldn’t defeat the true might of… Equestria’s true ruler. Who’s the winner now?”</p><p class="double">Celestia stepped through a hole in the wall. “Me, actually.”</p><p class="double">Discord rolled his eyes. Chrysalis finally collapsed to the floor, her last two conscious changelings standing guard over her. Nightmare Moon’s spell fizzled out, and she wobbled on her hooves.</p><p class="double">Sombra started snoring. <b>“Cryyyys… taaaaals…”</b></p><p class="double">“Right.” Celestia decided to ignore him for now. “Anyway. Who wants some tea?”</p><p><hr></p><p>“This is stupid…” Chrysalis muttered, finishing off the paperwork and passing it to Princess Cadence.</p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry…” Cadence replied, after checking the date. “I’m afraid that Sombra has booked that month to attempt a hostile takeover of Equestria. You’ll have to reschedule.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Chrysalis stamped on the floor. “That’s not fair! You’ve only <i>got</i> one wedding!”</p><p class="double">“Sorry.” Cadence shrugged. “At least it’s better than another double booking, right?”</p><p class="double">“I suppose…”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">11.6 (Mandemon)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;3... 2... 1... Get ready...&quot; Twilight said, as the moment of Nightmare Moon’s return came closer. Her latest plan to speed up the whole collecting Elements of Harmony had worked well. Too bad the others weren&#039;t Awake in this loop.</p><p class="double">Right on time, Nightmare Moon appeared on the stage.</p><p class="double">Wearing a top hat and wearing a monocle.</p><p class="double">&quot;I say, this is the most joyous time indeed! For I have returned from my enforced leave of this word, as decreed by my sister!&quot; the dark alicorn said, in an affected accent.</p><p class="double">&quot;What,&quot; Twilight said, echoing the feelings of everyone else.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gotcha! How&#039;s it going, Twilight?&quot; Luna said, shifting away from her Nightmare Moon appearance and dropping her disguise.</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot; Twilight had the sinking feeling that she’d just been punk’d.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, come on! Don&#039;t look at me like that. You pulled all kinds of tricks on me in numerous loops, for once it&#039;s my turn,&quot; Luna said with a smile. &quot;Now, how shall we trick my sister? I assume she is not Awake, seeing how your friends there are very confused.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight pondered. “Hmmm… Pinkie, do you have a clown wig available?”</p><p class="double">“Of course!” Pinkie reached behind a bush… no, on second glance she picked up the bush, and pulled a cord to turn it from green to rainbow coloured. “I have them all around Ponyville!”</p><p class="double">Luna developed a grin. “I like where this is going.”</p><p class="double">“Can somepony explain what’s goin’ on?” Applejack asked.</p><p><hr></p><p>11.7 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Sweetie Belle? Where are Scootaloo and Applebloom? And where is your project for the Science fair?&quot; Cheerilee looked around, in case she’d missed two fillies and a project.</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re bringing it here right now, Miss Cherrilee. We did ask if we could do a combined project and you did agree.&quot; Sweetie gave a nice smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I did, but I expect something that reflects a high level of effort from all three of you.&quot; The teacher frowned; it would be a hard one to mark, in truth, but they worked so much better together she didn’t have the heart to say no.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha!” As usual, Diamond Tiara cut in. “I bet those three blank flanks produced a big fat nothing, just like the cutie-marks they don&#039;t have! My daddy brought me the finest model airship kit money could buy!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh really, Diamond Tiara? I thought you said you built it yourself.&quot; Sweetie looked sly for a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;I did, I built it all myself! I even read the explanation of how it works…” Diamond tailed off, realizing she’d just be digging herself a hole if she kept going, and changed tack. “At least I have a project; Sweetie Belle doesn&#039;t even have a paper airplane!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a paper one, no...&quot; Sweetie Belle heard the howl of jet engines and grinned.</p><p class="double">A shadow fell across the school yard as a winged shape swept over it on jets of flame.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahh! It&#039;s a dragon!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hide!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Call for help!&quot;</p><p class="double">The blocky, angular shape of a Mareitech space fighter did a vertical landing in the field beside the school, and the whine of its engines died down. It was painted white with burgundy trim and tail fins, on which was emblazoned the blue and white Cutie-mark Crusaders logo. The twin canopy lifted up, revealing Scootaloo in the front seat and Applebloom sitting behind her and to the side. There was an empty space beside the earth-pony filly.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it?&quot; Cheerilee finally stuttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s our flying machine, the Cutie Mark Crusader Mark VIII. Applebloom did the primary design and engineering, Scootaloo developed the flight control systems and aerodynamics, and I worked on the thaumic power core and avionics, though I did get Twilight Sparkle to help me with the power core design. But that&#039;s allowed; you did say we should get an adult pony to help us if we were doing anything dangerous.&quot; Sweetie looked earnest. “That’s okay, right?”</p><p class="double">The three of them had been hiding their looped abilities until now, specifically for the fun of the reveal, but now she could show off a bit. Her horn glowed and she started showing a slide show of illusion images showing the design and construction of the CMC8 in the workshop/hangar they&#039;d created under the tree-house. </p><p><hr></p><p>11.3 additional (Madfish)</p><p><hr></p><p>The Crusaders’ attention was drawn from the pyre of their first biplane by a small herd of four unfamiliar ponies racing in their direction.</p><p class="double">None of them were much out of colthood from their looks, and one shouting, &quot;I say, are you three alright?&quot; revealed at least one of them had a strong and unusual accent.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re fine. We remembered to make parachutes… this time.&quot; Applebloom blushed.</p><p class="double">Sweetie winced, remembering what had happened when they’d tried making their own balloon. It had taken a very alert Rainbow Dash to catch them when the thing caught fire…</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, jolly good, I suppose…&quot; the speaker was a slightly overweight pale green pegasus. Having said his piece, he trailed off in confusion.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo broke the silence by asking, &quot;So who are you anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Yes, how rude of us,&quot; clearly now they had ascertained that the fillies were safe the pegasus had other things on his mind. Refocusing, he started introductions, &quot;I am Algae- Algy, my friend here I think is Jams,&quot; he wiped a frustrated hoof across his brow as he nodded to the other pegasus with him, a tan stallion with his mane tucked into a flight cap. &quot;Sorry- James,&quot; clearly wanting to finish he sped up, &quot;Smyth and Ginger,&quot; he finished with a gesture to a grey earthpony with black mane and mustache, and an appropriately coloured unicorn who was clearly the youngest there.</p><p class="double">With some concern Sweetie asked, &quot;Are you feeling all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chuckling the tan pegasus added, &quot;Just a bit under the weather. I don&#039;t think any of us have ridden the dragon quite as hard as this before. I don’t even remember getting the cig…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were riding a dragon? That&#039;s kind of cool, most ponies just run scared of them,” Scootaloo said. “So… you&#039;re Loopers, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Blank looks.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, repeating the same things over and over?&quot; Applebloom tried, wondering what a <i>cig</i> was.</p><p class="double">More blank looks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your <i>first</i> loop and it&#039;s a Crossed Loop? How&#039;s that even work?&quot; Sweetie gestured in the air, trying to show how strange that was.</p><p class="double">&quot;We can&#039;t even get Twilight to explain this stuff to them… she&#039;s gone to set something up for Sombra and we&#039;re the only other ones Awake,&quot; Scootaloo sighed.</p><p class="double">James blinked, &quot;I think it would be best if we saw a doctor. I don&#039;t think we&#039;re hearing what you&#039;re actually saying.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">11.8 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Applebloom still found it hard to see the lack of recognition in her best friends’ eyes. This was the hardest part about looping, everything you&#039;d done and seen with your friends just… wiped away.</p><p class="double">At least she knew, thanks to Twilight in their first – and joint – Loop, that there <i>was</i> a Looping Sweetie out there, and a Looping Scootaloo. Fillies who remembered trying to beat up Chrysalis, and accidentally causing a major invasion of Equestria…</p><p class="double">Still, these were versions of her friends too. She owed it to them to give them the best time she could.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle shivered slightly, but looked over gratefully at the earth pony. &quot;I think so, but she was really scary!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw... Rainbow Dash could have taken her!&quot; The pegasus on the other side of the unicorn exclaimed.</p><p class="double">Applebloom grinned, having seen the previous loop where Dash had gone full alicorn and done exactly that. &quot;I&#039;m sure she could. My sister just wanted to make sure she didn&#039;t take her on before any-pony else was ready to help.&quot;</p><p class="double">That had to be done carefully. Implying Dash <i>couldn&#039;t</i>, or calling her reckless, was an easy way to make Scootaloo hostile.</p><p class="double">&quot;That was your sister?&quot; Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep! Mah sister Applejack, and I&#039;m Applebloom. Pleased to meetcha.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Scootaloo... and I wish Rainbow Dash was my sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn had moved back slightly, looking down, but Applebloom quickly turned her attention to her. &quot;How about you? We&#039;ve shared the underneath-of-a-table-hiding from the real life Nightmare Moon. Am I ever going to up my offering on Nightmare Night!” That got a chuckle. “But that makes us &#039;hiding under a table&#039; buddies. We should know each others names, at least.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweetie Belle.&quot; She looked more confident. &quot;And Rarity is my sister, the white unicorn with the three diamond cutie-mark. Ooh! That Nightmare Moon isn&#039;t getting any of <i>my</i> candy, not after the way she treated Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom hauled herself from under the table, very deliberately trying to hide her flank with a fold of cloth. &quot;Well if she tries to eat you, I&#039;ll help stop her! I know kung fu! She&#039;ll have trouble eating any-pony with no teeth!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can help too!&quot; Scootaloo exclaimed. &quot;I&#039;ll run rings around her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You can fly that fast?&quot; Applebloom felt a rush of warmth, as Sweetie started engaging in the conversation again and it began to move from ‘her talking to the others’ to ‘all three of them talking together’.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo slumped. &quot;I can&#039;t fly, not yet, but I&#039;m the fastest on a scooter in all of Ponyville. And I will fly one day, just as awesomely as Rainbow Dash!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t doubt it.&quot; Applebloom finally let the cloth slip, making it look like an accident as she helped the other two out from under the table. She glanced back and then hung her head. &quot;No! It&#039;s okay, you don&#039;t have to hang around with a blank-flank if you don&#039;t want to. In class, it&#039;s only Twist and me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You got a problem with blank-flanks?&quot; Scootaloo sounded half annoyed, half amused. She presented her own bare flank. &quot;I thought I was the only one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! I thought I was!&quot; Sweetie Belle exclaimed. &quot;Let&#039;s be friends!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom still teared up slightly at that. &quot;I&#039;d like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that&#039;d be great!&quot; Scootaloo bounced, fluttering her wings to get some hang time. &quot;The three of us are totally alike! No cutie-marks, lots of awesome...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe we can do something about that, the first thing I mean.&quot; Applebloom suggested. Without the common cause of cutie-mark hunting, their friendship grew more slowly and she wanted every moment before it was snatched away. Despite the fact that she&#039;d pretty much given up, she still held out hope she could help her friends. &quot;We could work together to find out who we are and what we&#039;re supposed to be.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh oh! I know, we could form our own secret society!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m liking this idea!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How about we call ourselves, the Cutie Mark Crusaders!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom grinned with the others, feeling at home again, but part of her was still wistful. Well, maybe this time it would be different. After all, these loops were endless, maybe in eternity even she&#039;d be able to find her cutie-mark.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">11.9 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p><u>Calling out the Cutie</u></p><p><hr></p><p>Applebloom had experienced about a dozen loops by now, and was fed up. Neither Sweetie Belle nor Scootaloo was looping with any regularity yet, and while she had loopers like her sister and Twilight Sparkle to help, having to make friends with her cutie mark compadres over and over again was frustrating. But worst of all was having to deal with the ever increasing nastiness of Diamond Tiara, over and over again. It wasn&#039;t that it hurt so much any more, after you&#039;d been called Blank Flank enough times, you developed scar tissue over your sense of self esteem.</p><p class="double">No, it was just annoying, and dull. It wasn&#039;t even as if the two stooges were particularly inventive. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon were so shallow, you could use them as a ford. They delighted in making ponies&#039; lives miserable, though Applebloom was ashamed to admit that she hadn&#039;t really noticed until she&#039;d become one of their primary targets. The endless stream of &#039;blank flank&#039; and &#039;loser&#039; comments was more like Neighponese water torture. Well, it was time to do something about that, for this loop at least.</p><p class="double">This was the critical point. Cheerilee followed the script for her lesson on cutie-marks to the letter, and when Diamond Tiara hissed to her and tried to get her to take the blank note, she went along with it. As per usual Cheerilee didn’t notice anything when the evil minded brat started messing around, but as soon as the note was in Applebloom’s hooves, she homed in on the earth pony like a stooping hawk.</p><p class="double">Applebloom had considered replacing the blank paper with a vicious note from Diamond Tiara to Applebloom, written in disappearing reappearing ink so it would make sense when she jumped up and made her smart remark about Applebloom’s blank flank being like the blank paper. She’d even found a discarded report by the other pony and practised her hoof-writing style to add authenticity, but ultimately she’d decided that was the sort of thing Diamond Tiara would do, and she wasn’t going to let the mean spirited brat turn her into something similar.</p><p class="double">No, this was better. She’d fight the bully honestly and directly, not by sneaky tricks. The whole thing with Babs Seed had taught her that sometimes the only way to deal with bullying was openly, not by becoming what you hated, much as you’d get some temporary pleasure out of turning the tables. She’d also have a chance to talk about something that she’d been thinking about more and more as loop after loop had ended as it started, without a cutie-mark.</p><p class="double">She’d talked it over with Twilight Sparkle and Zecora, as well as her big sister. They’d helped her to get her thoughts in order, and prepare for this. Two of them were loopers with literally millennia of experience, as well as being the smartest and most sensible ponies she knew, and while Zecora wasn’t a looper, she had a vast reserve of wisdom.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee took the note, as usual. “What could be so important that it couldn&#039;t wait until after class? It’s blank!”</p><p class="double">“Remind you of any-pony?” As usual Diamond ‘witted’ Tiara made her snarky remark and got the entire class laughing at her oh so hysterical comment. She must have spent hours coming up with that one.</p><p class="double"><i>Time to change the script</i>, the farm pony thought. Applebloom let the laughter die down a bit, then asked; “Miss Cheerilee? Do you believe Diamond Tiara is right?”</p><p class="double">The teacher looked confused. “What do you mean?”</p><p class="double">“Well, apart from the fact that you let her just stand up and make what was clearly meant to be an insult about blank flanks in general and me in particular, you’ve been saying how wonderful it is to get your cutie mark. So that it means if you don’t yet have your cutie mark, you’re an object to be pitied at best and ridiculed and laughed at at worst, at least that&#039;s the way Diamond Tiara reckons it…”</p><p class="double">That cut off any remaining laughter like a knife.</p><p class="double">“Of course not! Just because you haven’t found what makes you special, doesn’t mean you aren’t. As I said before, your cutie-mark comes in its own time.” Cheerilee seemed genuinely shocked, and Applebloom gave a relieved grin. However, there was still another point to be made.</p><p class="double">“I’m right glad to hear that, but it still leaves a problem. You tried to make me feel better by talking about me finding a cutie-mark talent, which is kind of saying that it’s your cutie-mark based talent that makes you special. Is that the only way a pony can feel worthwhile?”</p><p class="double">She sighed. “Take me for example. Yes, I’ve never found that one talent I’m really good at, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have useful skills. I can do lots of different things, I can cook up to the level of a short order chef, balance a ledger, and not just on top of my head, clean a house, field repair a plough or a cart or build one given the tools and materials, then pull it fully loaded over 2 miles of rough ground in 15 minutes – and that takes more than strength and endurance, you have to be able to pick your route or you’ll end up axle deep in the ground – care for and feed most domestic and farm animals, herd many of them, change a baby, sew a dress, change a wound dressing, care for most minor ailments and trauma injuries up to setting a bone or sewing up a wound, speak Zebra – though I’ll admit I’m only conversation level, not fully fluent – make a speech,” she grinned, “identify dozens of common and uncommon herbs and magical plants, brew 32 different herbal medicines and 3 actual magical potions, have a brown belt in Northern Shire-lin Karate and will test for my black next month, navigate the Everfree, abseil, free dive, find my way by the stars, and name a good chunk of the constellations.”</p><p class="double">She took a deep breath. “… and that’s all I can think of at the moment. But if one of them is my particular talent, my flank hasn’t gotten the message, so by cutie-mark based thinking, I’m second rate, to be told, not to worry, ’your cutie-mark will appear in time’. I’m not saying you’re doing it to be nasty, Miss Cheerilee, I’m just trying to show that your cutie-mark and your cutie-mark talent might not the only way of judging a pony’s worth.”</p><p class="double">She’d started connecting with Zecora and Temple Fortress, her martial arts sensei, from the moment she awoke each loop, and done her best to start off from where she&#039;d left the previous loop each time. While she still worked with the other Crusaders, trying out many things, she&#039;d found skills she&#039;d liked, and done her best to learn them the long way round. Add to that some of Twilight’s training on how to organise the memories of many loops so they didn’t drive you insane, and she&#039;d become a lot better at retaining knowledge.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t perfect, the muscle memories didn’t carry over from loop to loop, but even there the effort to get them back was purely re-training, as if she&#039;d slacked off her training for a few months and had to get back into shape. She&#039;d had subjective decades to train, so she was a lot better than she admitted. Plus she&#039;d had those same decades to learn all the skills that ran a farm, of which there were a lot. Helping Fluttershy, Rarity and Twilight out out, and learning what they could teach in return, had added to her broad base of skills and knowledge.</p><p class="double">Of course, Diamond Tiara couldn’t let her litany pass. “Ha! As if you could really do all those things! Where would you even find out about Zebras, or learn how to make magic potions? Only unicorns can do alchemy!”</p><p class="double">“Some potions don’t need a unicorn to enchant them. If you use innately magical ingredients any-pony can create one. And I was taught by Zecora. She’s the zebra that lives in the Everfree forest.”</p><p class="double">That got shocked gasps and a few small screams. “But she’s a monster.” “Evil witch!”</p><p class="double">Even Miss Cheeerilee looked horrified. Applebloom rounded on her classmates.</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s not some kind of monster just because she lives in the Everfree! She’s really cool, a shaman, a healer and student of magic and herbalism. She came all the way from her homeland to the Everfree because it has so many unique magical plants and herbs and she wanted to study them. Can you imagine the courage that took, to leave everything – everyone – she ever knew?</p><p class="double">“It doesn’t help that the inhabitants of the only nearby town have only avoided driving her away or worse because they’re too scared of what she’d do to them if they tried. I guess us colts and fillies could be forgiven, after all, we just believe what our parents tell us.” She turned to face Cheerilee. “But I’d have thought at least you’d… I don’t know, be willing to find out the truth. That’s what you’ve always taught us, to learn and understand, find out for ourselves.”</p><p class="double">“Sure, right!” Diamond Tiara sneered. “It’s convenient that you’re claiming to be taught by someone who no-one wants to go near, so no-body can ask her! As for you, how would you get to even talk to her without being turned into a toad? Though that might be an improvement!”</p><p class="double">“”Uh… hello? Sweet Apple Acres is next to the Everfree Forest. We check the boundaries regularly to see nothing freaky comes out. Zecora was collecting some herbs near the boundary, and she didn’t seem to be turning any-pony into anything, any more than she does anything bad when she comes in to town. So I screwed up my courage and talked to her. She was really nice, and explained what she was doing, and…”</p><p class="double">Applebloom shrugged. “We got to be friends. I could go on about how Applejack and Twilight Sparkle got involved, and how they eventually trusted her to see me safely to her place, and how she eventually let me start learning from her. Zebra magic is closest to earth pony magic, but they can do things with it Equestrian ponies never thought of.</p><p class="double">“Our earth magic is focussed inwards, such as our magic strength and toughness, or passive like our connection with growing things. But they can project it like unicorn magic. It can’t do all the flashy spells unicorns can, but it can affect living and natural things. Some of Zecora’s brew are just non-magical herbs, some use magical ingredients, and some are use the magical herbs as a base to invest some of their own earth magic. You can get some really powerful healing and enhancement effects that way.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, and I suppose you can do all that!” Diamond Tiara sniffed.</p><p class="double">Applebloom gave an amused snort. “I already said I only know three real potions, and they’re all purely based on magical ingredients. I’m gonna need a lot more training before I can project earth magic like a zebra. Though I’m hoping my martial arts will help. Northern Shire-lin is based on drawing on the magic of the earth actively to enhance your attacks and toughness beyond what passive earth pony magic can do. If I can learn to draw on it, I should be able to learn to project it. Once again, it’s going to take a lot more practice and hard work, but it&#039;ll be worth it.”</p><p class="double">“I still think you’re lying just to be the centre of attention!” Actually, that <i>was</i> probably a fairly sensible thing to assume. The list of skills she’d rattled off <i>had</i> taken decades to pick up… but it was also wrong, and she wasn’t going to let the accusation stand.</p><p class="double">“Ask Twilight Sparkle or my big sis.” Applebloom gave a small smirk. “As for the rest of my skills… try me!”</p><p class="double">Then she turned to Miss Cheerilee. “Sorry about going off like that, but I’ve been thinking about this stuff for a long time, and hearing her act like that just set it off. I’ve worked hard for my skills, tried a lot of different things to see if they were my cutie-mark talent, then decided to continue them and learn them anyway.”</p><p class="double">This was absolutely true, she was only omitting that she’d done so over a dozen or so time-loops.</p><p class="double">“I’m proud of what I’ve achieved, and hearing it dismissed simply because I don’t have a, a… sticker, got me riled up. Which reminds me, we all know her cutie-mark is that diamond tiara she’s so proud of, but I don’t remember hearing what her actual talent is… Oh, and I’ve helped Applejack nurture and hoof pollinate plenty of apple tree seedlings, and my flanks still bare, so despite my name, my talent is not making apples bloom. So what about it, Diamond Tiara? This is a lesson about cutie-marks. What does yours mean?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t have to answer you!” Diamond Tiara exclaimed defensively.</p><p class="double">“Nope, you don&#039;t. I just figured since your so all fired proud of that cutie-mark, your talent must be awesome. Strange you don&#039;t want anyone to know it; I&#039;d have reckoned you&#039;d shout it from the highest rooftops. I&#039;m still looking for mine, despite what I said, and me and my friends are going to have fun doing it too.” She finished her little speech with a broad grin; it was true, too. <i>Next up, surfing!</i></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s face was furious, and Applebloom knew she&#039;d won. This round, at least. She&#039;d already made friends with the other Crusaders, so going to that cute-ceanera wasn&#039;t necessary, and having put Diamond Tiara in her place she intended to ignore her, possibly the worst possible thing she could do to an attention seeker like the pink earth pony.</p><p class="double">Since Applebloom wasn&#039;t going to steal the Heart&#039;s Desire plant this time, there&#039;d be no cutie-pox, and she thoroughly intended to get Sweetie Belle singing and Scootaloo dancing at the talent show. So the next time they&#039;d cross horns wouldn&#039;t be until Family Appreciation day. She already had a plan for that, and the Gabby Gums episode, not to mention her cousin&#039;s visit. Yes, time-looping wasn&#039;t exactly fun, but it had compensations.</p><p><hr></p><p>11.10 (Lord of Bones)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Hiding behind one of the potted plants along the hallway, Celestia watched and waited for her sis...no, for <i>Nightmare Moon </i>to take the bait. She didn&#039;t know what the dark alicorn was planning, but behind the pranks there had to be something… undoubtedly something nefarious. All the same, she&#039;d gone to all the trouble of making her trap decidedly harmless, but more than potent enough to buy time for a follow-up binding spell.</p><p class="double">So, she waited.</p><p class="double">And, like Grogar himself, Nightmare Moon slipped out of the shadows and looked down at the trap. The elegant head looked to and fro, then bent down to eat the cake holding down the pressure plate.</p><p class="double">Celestia bravely held back a sob as her prized cake; so prized that she could only have it once a year, was demolished by the moon princess. Still, it was for a good cause, and when the pressure plate was set off-</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon burped, and blushed. The empty plate vanished in a dark blue burst, leaving Nightmare Moon alone with nothing other than the crumbs around her muzzle and a conjured napkin.</p><p class="double">And a conspicuously absent trap.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; snapped the Sun Princess. She sprung out of her hiding place and pushed the surprised night alicorn aside, before stomping on the plate to no effect. She struck it a few more times with her hoof, until she heard the &#039;click&#039;. &quot;Fina...oh, <i>horseapples.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">There was a decidedly uncouth &#039;SPLAT&#039;. Nightmare Moon winced, and Celestia poked her head out of several hundred pounds&#039; worth of cake batter and extra-thick whipped cream.</p><p class="double">Stumbling and swearing, the Sun Princess tossed and turned in the mixture, before she saw Nightmare Moon&#039;s face; a face that was crinkled up in a smile so very <i>Luna </i>that it made Celestia&#039;s heart ache.</p><p class="double">A silver-shod hoof bopped her playfully on the nose. &quot;Beep beep,&quot; laughed Nightmare Moon, before zooming away in a burst of speed.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>12.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Diplomancy – Ticket Master</u></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had had a suspicion of what was going to happen from the time she&#039;d come to help out Applejack, which had turned into a solid belief when she heard about the farm-pony&#039;s bet with Big Mac and now turned to certainty as Spike burped up a letter with a Royal seal. Oh great, it was that time again.</p><p class="double">“A letter from Princess Celestia!” Twilight had been thinking about this day, and how to handle it better than she had the first time. She&#039;d always felt guilty about how the Grand Galloping Gala had turned out for her friends. The after-party they&#039;d had at Donut Joe&#039;s had been fun, but all the anticipation and excitement, leading up to that massive disappointment... At least these loops would be good for something. Spike was reading the well remembered words.</p><p class="double"><i>Hear ye, hear ye. Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce The Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of</i>, eh, yadda yadda yadda, <i>cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.</i></p><p class="double">“The Grand Galloping Gala? Woo hoo...” As Applejack&#039;s expression lit up, she schooled her own to be less illuminated. “What&#039;s the matter sugar-cube? I&#039;d have figured you&#039;d have been as pleased as a hound dog with two tails to wag!”</p><p class="double">As Spike burped up the two golden tickets, Twilight replied, “It&#039;s a great honour to be asked, and it&#039;ll be wonderful to spend time with Princess Celestia... when she&#039;s not doing her duties as host. I guess that&#039;s why the two tickets, so I can bring a friend to keep me company. It&#039;s just, I&#039;ve never been, but from what I&#039;ve heard there&#039;s certainly no galloping. It&#039;ll be a big bunch of nobles standing around comparing egos and wallet sizes. I&#039;ll fit in about as well as a spell book in a rack of ledgers and fashion magazines. Have you been to one Spike?”</p><p class="double">“No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don&#039;t want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense. “</p><p class="double">Applejack cut in. “Well if he ain&#039;t interested, I surely would. Land sakes, if I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin&#039; our tasty vittles till the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin&#039; up &#039;round here.” Applejack’s eyes became distant. “We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big Macintosh could replace that saggy old plough, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip. Why, I&#039;d give my left hind leg to go to that gala.”</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Twilight raised a protesting hoof. “You do realise it&#039;s held in the palace grounds? It&#039;ll probably be catered by the palace chefs. Your wares would be up against fancy hors d&#039;oeuvres made by the finest chefs in Equestria...”</p><p class="double">She was interrupted by a vertically descending Rainbow Dash. She glanced up and materialised a thick mattress over her and Applejack&#039;s head that intercepted the plummeting pegasus like a catcher&#039;s mitt. As she lowered it down, the pegasus sprang off and asked, “Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?”</p><p class="double">Applejack huffed. “Rainbow Dash, you told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing, spyin&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?” The irrepressible pegasus replied, hovering upside down in front of Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Yes, but I&#039;d have thought you of all ponies wouldn&#039;t find a fancy dance like the Gala interesting,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">Dash began to spin her fantasy about how going to the Gala would be her ticket into the Wonderbolts, and Twilight wondered why she hadn&#039;t spotted the many, many flaws in the pegasus&#039; plan the first time. Probably because she had no more idea of what the Gala was really like back then than they did, and had been just as excited. She felt even more guilty. She was the one who always did her research, who found things out, and she&#039;d let her friends down by not checking this. Still, she could at least do something for Dash.</p><p class="double">“This performance... It&#039;s one of their most spectacular and important?”</p><p class="double">“Yup!” Rainbow Dash preened.</p><p class="double">“Requiring split second precision and teamwork?” Twilight pressed.</p><p class="double">“You betcha!”</p><p class="double">“And if some-pony dived in the middle of it and threw off their timing, the whole thing could unravel?”</p><p class="double">“Yes... wait what? Uh....” Rainbow Dash gave a rueful chuckle and rubbed the back of her neck with a hoof. “Heh, heh, I guess I hadn&#039;t thought of that. But I could still go and spend time with them, get to know them.”</p><p class="double">“Uh huh, Twilight was goin&#039; to offer me the ticket, weren&#039;t ya?” Applejack interjected. “I asked first!”</p><p class="double">“That doesn&#039;t mean you own it, c&#039;mon, I&#039;ll hoof wrestle you. Winner gets the ticket.” Rainbow dashed over to a stump and held up a hoof and Applejack quickly joined her.</p><p class="double">Twilight managed to push them apart before they got started. “I&#039;ll decide who gets the ticket, they&#039;re mine after all. But I don&#039;t think either of you would get as much out of going as you think. As I was saying to Applejack, the Gala will be catered by the Palace kitchens part of the ticket price, and while I&#039;d pick her confections over some frilly palace hors d’oeuvres&nbsp;&nbsp;any time, those upper crust Canterlot party-goers will probably stick their noses up at buying stuff off a cart.”</p><p class="double">She rounded on Dash. “As for hooking up with the Wonderbolts, I suspect every-pony at the party will have the same idea. I doubt you&#039;d get any more time with them than I&#039;ll have to talk to the Princess. I <i>have</i> to go,” Twilight emphasized, adding just a bit of a slouch to her stance. “The Princess invited me by name, and I can&#039;t disappoint her, but you don&#039;t have to.” Her stomach rumbled, and she gave an embarrassed little grin.</p><p class="double">Neither Applejack or Rainbow Dash looked pleased.</p><p class="double">Applejack exclaimed, “It sounds like you&#039;ll don&#039;t want us to go!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, what&#039;s the matter? Aren&#039;t we fancy enough to be with you at the Gala?” Rainbow huffed.</p><p class="double">“Girls, that&#039;s not it at all...” Twilight cried out, but the pair of them were walking off in opposite directions. She gave a big sigh and hung her head. This wasn&#039;t going to be as easy as she thought. “C&#039;mon Spike. I&#039;ll wait until they&#039;ve both cooled down. I need something to eat anyway.”</p><p class="double">“Now that&#039;s an idea!” the little dragon enthused.</p><p class="double">She levitated the dragon up onto her back, and as an afterthought, levitated all the remaining baskets of Golden Delicious over and into the barn before heading back into Ponyville. In the distance she could see the two other ponies continuing their interrupted hoof-wrestling match.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they walked through the town towards the central square, Spike asked, “So who <i>are</i> you giving the ticket to?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m hoping no-pony!” Twilight said. “Not that I wouldn&#039;t love to have both of them there as friends, I was just trying to make sure they weren&#039;t disappointed...”</p><p class="double">Even fore-knowledge couldn&#039;t always save you from the bouncing ball of chaos that was Pinkie Pie. Exactly why she shot out of the top half of an open door would remain a mystery, but her destination quickly turned out to be Twilight. Pinkie Pie landed on the road, and the two golden tickets landed on her muzzle.</p><p class="double">“Gah! Bats! Bats on my face!” She engaged in the usual zipping around like some insane ground bound firework, then finally realised what they actually were and went off into her own little fantasy land about what the Gala was like. Twilight reckoned it was better to let her run down on her own, so she left well enough alone until Pinkie finished with, “Oh thank you Twilight, it&#039;s the most wonderful-est gift ever. “</p><p class="double">Twilgiht attempted some damage limitation. “Y&#039;know, that doesn&#039;t sound like any description of the Gala I&#039;ve ever heard. It’s more of...”</p><p class="double">“Are those what I think they are?” Rarity was there gazing at the tickets clutched in Spike&#039;s hand.</p><p class="double">“Yes, yes, yes! Twilight&#039;s taking me to The Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot,” Pinkie said, completely ignoring Twilight’s hoof-waving.</p><p class="double">Rarity was starry eyed. “The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I&#039;ve never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour! It&#039;s where I truly belong, and where I&#039;m destined to meet… <i>him.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Him! … Who?” Pinkie Pie asked, and boy did she get an answer. Twilight still couldn&#039;t believe that Rarity had ever fantasised over a worthless piece of horseflesh like Prince Blueblood, but then for someone who&#039;d never met him, his title and appearance might make his superficially attractive. Prince Blueblood was one pony she thought couldn&#039;t improve even if he <i>were</i> stuck in a time loop. As for becoming a Princess, well, Twilight had ideas along that line for those of her friends, but hooking up with Blueblood wasn&#039;t one of them…</p><p class="double">“Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... <i>party</i>, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph!” Rarity folded her forelegs.</p><p class="double">Twilight couldn&#039;t help it, the idea of Rarity calling Blueblood her true love was just so silly she burst out laughing.</p><p class="double">“Well, really!” Rarity growled. “You don&#039;t believe that the Prince would be interested in a simple Ponyville girl such as myself?”</p><p class="double">“No, I mean yes, but...”</p><p class="double">“Maybe he&#039;d see more to me than you obviously do!” The white unicorn flounced off, looking annoyed.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s okay, you were going to give the ticket to me anyway...”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie was interrupted as the ticket was snatched out of his claws by Angel, who dashed back to Fluttershy with it. “Angel, these are perfect.”</p><p class="double">Twilight rubbed her forehead with a hoof. “I haven&#039;t made <i>any </i>decisions about the extra ticket yet.”</p><p class="double">“You haven&#039;t?” asked Pinkie Pie, shocked, and Rarity appeared by her side.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy asked. “Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be alright, if you haven&#039;t given it to someone else...”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “Let me guess, you&#039;re interested in seeing the Princesses&#039; private garden.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy hesitated, then was urged on by Angel. “Oh my, yes! Well it is only open the night of the Gala, and that&#039;s the only night all the flowers will be in bloom, not to mention the fauna, the humming hummingbirds and the buzzing buzzards... “</p><p class="double">“Wait just a minute!” Rainbow Dash dropped down from the sky.</p><p class="double">“You were following me, “ Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">“No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn&#039;t matter. I couldn&#039;t risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.”</p><p class="double">“Wait just another minute.” Applejack was there too.</p><p class="double">“And the gang&#039;s all here!” Twilight rolled her eyes. The five ponies were getting into a five way argument, and her stomach was rumbling. “Right now I could eat just about anything, even oatmeal.”</p><p class="double">“For lunch? Oatmeal? Are you crazy?” called out Pinkie Pie before she returned to the fray.</p><p class="double">No-pony was happy right then and there, and they made no secret of it as they complained. Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Rarity all seemed to share the opinion that she didn&#039;t think them suitable for a fancy party, Pinkie Pie was… well… Pinkie Pie, but it was the depressed Fluttershy who tugged at her heart strings the most. Maybe she should tell them what she had planned, but she wanted to get everything organised first.</p><p class="double">Twilight lit off her horn and threw up a firework spell which went off with a bang. “Quiet!”</p><p class="double">She sighed. “Girls, please don&#039;t argue. Applejack, I already explained why I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll get much out of going to the gala with a cart, and Rainbow, it&#039;s not going to get you into the Wonderbolts. Rarity, Prince Blueblood may look the part, but he&#039;s really not your type. Pinkie Pie, the Gala isn&#039;t the sort of party you&#039;re thinking off, a formal ball, not a carnival. And Fluttershy, you aren&#039;t even bothered about the Gala, you&#039;re only interested in the gardens.”</p><p class="double">“Huh, it sounds like you don&#039;t want any of us to go to the Gala!” Applejack said.</p><p class="double">“Not like this!” Twilight was getting fed up of not being fed. “Right now, I&#039;m going to get myself some food. Meet me at the library at sundown, and I will try and work this out so everyone goes away happy.”</p><p class="double">“You will?” They chorused, looking happier.</p><p class="double">“Yes, now I&#039;ve got to go!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Rainbow, I am <i>not </i>comfortable accepting unwanted favours, so I&#039;d appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.“</p><p class="double">Twilight materialised an umbrella for the table at the restaurant as Rainbow Dash sealed up the hole she&#039;d made in the clouds. “I said sundown, and I meant it!”</p><p class="double">Just as she was about to take a bite of the sandwich, Rarity appeared with her own private rain shield. “Twilight, it&#039;s raining!”</p><p class="double">“Yes, yes I had noticed,” Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">“Come with me, you should get inside before you catch a cold.”</p><p class="double">“Let me guess, you just happen to have a dress for me that&#039;s perfect for the Gala, and you just happen to have a matching dress.” The Anchor rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double">Rarity blushed. “Well, maybe? But that&#039;s what friends do for one another, and we are the best of friends, are we not?”</p><p class="double">“A true, true friend would trust me to do the right thing, and wait until sundown.” Twilight growled. “Oh, and let me eat my meal in peace!”</p><p class="double">“Did someone say eat?” Applejack&#039;s voice drifted over. Twilight quickly munched on her daisy sandwich before the farm-pony&#039;s covered cart got there. Seeing all the goodies stacked inside would make her even hungrier.</p><p class="double">Before the farm-pony could even speak, Twilight cut her off. “No, your farm made treats may be delicious, but they&#039;re a bribe, just like the dress Rarity made. I expected more from you. I told you, sundown!”</p><p class="double">She finished off her sandwich and dashed away, with Spike on her back and a purple shield protecting her from the rain. As expected, Fluttershy was inside, spring cleaning.</p><p class="double">“No. Thank you for the help, but I&#039;m not accepting favours from anyone. That&#039;s not what friendship is about. Sundown!”</p><p class="double">As she let the pair out (and had Angel bunny kick her in the fetlock en passant) she was dragged out of the door by a pair of pink fore-hooves.</p><p class="double">Her horn lit up at the top of the first bump, and she brought herself to a stop in mid-air. “Pinkie! Sundown, no sooner!”</p><p class="double">She teleported back to the library, and slammed a purple energy dome over the whole place. She had a lot to do, and she couldn’t afford interruptions… or being chased around by the crazed horde of ponies that would manifest when Pinkie spilled the beans.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">At sundown, with her preparations done, she raised the dome. A few moments later, there was a knock at the door. Spike opened it, and the five ponies trooped in.</p><p class="double">“Have you decided...?” It was hard to tell which pony had asked first.</p><p class="double">“Will you let me say something first?” Twilight’s tone made them all pause. “Do you have any idea how bad you made me feel by trying to force me to choose one of you? Whoever I chose, I&#039;d leave four other disappointed ponies, four friends I let down. I may be still learning about friendship, but bribing me and trying to cheat each other out of the ticket? I&#039;m <i>sure</i> that&#039;s not it. You are all my friends, and I want to make you all happy, and with just one extra ticket I can&#039;t!”</p><p class="double">All five ponies looked back and forth between each other guiltily. As she hoped, each of them relinquished their claim on a ticket, even Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re sorry, Twilight!” they all said, in chorus.</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. Just because she intended to change things up, didn&#039;t mean she couldn&#039;t make the same point as originally. It had been a lesson for all of them the first time, and one of the first bonding experiences as a group. Now to the fun bit.</p><p class="double">“That being said, it <i>did</i> teach me an important lesson about friendship. That while sharing your blessings with friends is one of life&#039;s great pleasures, it isn&#039;t fun unless you share it with all your friends equally.” As she finished, the others’ faces went through various shades of puzzlement.</p><p class="double">She levitated seven tickets from the open saddlebag on the table and laid one in front of each of her friends. “I wrote to Princess Celestia asking if you could all come. She said yes.”</p><p class="double">The other ponies burst out in cheers. So far so good.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t thank me just yet. I heard some of you say I didn&#039;t want you to go because I thought you weren&#039;t good enough for a fancy place like Canterlot.” That stopped Rarity, Applejack and Rainbow Dash cheering, and the others stopped out of politeness. “Nothing could be farther from the truth! You&#039;re my friends, and I want the very best for you. I didn&#039;t want you to go to the Gala because I was trying to protect you from being <i>disappointed</i>!”</p><p class="double">That got them all looking curious.</p><p class="double">“I spent the afternoon doing research, and gotten direct confirmation from the Princess herself. She considers the Gala to be one of the dreariest, awful, most stuffy events of the year. And she&#039;s been doing it for a thousand years or more!” Twilight doubted that any of them understood quite how wearying a thousand years of boring social occasions would be… but she herself had at least some idea, and a little of that came across in her speech. “As host, she has to put up with it, and if I can do anything to relieve her boredom, I will be by her side. <i>That&#039;s</i> why I have a ticket.”</p><p class="double">“Applejack, taking a cart of goodies to the Gala will not net you the piles of money you hoped. It&#039;s fully catered, as I thought, and the sort of ponies you&#039;ll be selling have never bought off a stall in their life. They&#039;ll snub you, and all you&#039;ll bring home is sore hooves from standing around all night,” she shook her head, “along with a cart full of leftovers.”</p><p class="double">Seeing the farm-pony slump, she continued.</p><p class="double">“But if you go as a business mare, and talk to the ponies there, you might be able to pick up some contracts for Sweet Apple Acres. Speaking of which,” she winked, “I also found out who to talk to at the palace about supplying the apples for those fancy hors d’oeuvres I mentioned, and you&#039;ve already catered the Summer Sun Celebration for the Princess. I can set up a meeting, and I&#039;m confident once the chefs at the palace have tried your apples, you should get that contract. That should net you enough money for your Granny&#039;s new hip. As for the plough and the barn...”</p><p class="double">She lifted the pony bust off its pedestal and smashed it to pieces with her telekinesis, then cast a Reparo spell. It magically restored itself. “Let me have a look at them first before you hoof over any money.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight, this is too much...” Applejack started to say, but Twilight waved her silent.</p><p class="double">“Rainbow, I did some checking and I was right, the Gala is the busiest night of the year. I sent a letter to Spitfire herself, and she gave me a good idea of what they expect. It&#039;s the duty no-pony wants, being dragged around by ponies eager to get their picture taken, having to listen to endless dull stories from ponies who just want to be able to name drop. It&#039;s possibly the worst time to try and get to know a pony.” After all, Dash had only managed what she did the first time by a complete fluke that had proven nearly impossible to re-engineer.</p><p class="double">“You talked to the commander of the Wonderbolts directly?” The cyan pegasus was incredulous.</p><p class="double">“Not directly. I never really thought about it, but my position as Celestia&#039;s personal student does mean I have <i>some</i> status in court.” Rarity hid a grin at her self-deprecation, guessing at the probable depth of understatement. “Besides, my brother Shining Armour is adjutant to the Captain of the Guard at Canterlot castle, and it&#039;s likely he&#039;ll take over the top slot when Commander Ironhoof retires next year.</p><p class="double">“As adjutant, he deals with relations between the Royal Guard and Equestria&#039;s other services such as the Wonderbolts. They are often drawn from the Royal Guard and vice versa. He knows Spitfire personally, and he helped get my message through.”</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s eyes went wide. “Your brother is going to be Captain of the Royal Guard?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Twilight giggled. “Sorry, though, I think he&#039;s spoken for. My old foal sitter, Princess Cadence, I think she has a thing for him, and vice versa.”</p><p class="double">That had all of the ponies wide eyed. “Sugarcube, I had no idea...”</p><p class="double">“<i>I don’t</i> normally talk about it, I don&#039;t want ponies to think I&#039;m all high and mighty.”</p><p class="double">Spike chuckled. “Yeah, High And Mighty is a unicorn stallion and the second biggest snob in Canterlot after Prince Blueblood.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “I also mentioned that I knew a pegasus called Rainbow Dash who was one of the most awesome fliers I knew. We shall have to see if that goes anywhere, but mentioning things like your one pony controlled tornado and the way you cleared the sky in ten seconds flat apparently piqued her interest. I&#039;m hopeful she&#039;ll spare a few hours to come down and see you before the next Young Fliers Competition in Cloudsdale. I&#039;ve gotten you your chance to meet her, what you do with it is up to you.”</p><p class="double">“OhmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohMYGOSH!” Rainbow Dash didn&#039;t look like stopping any time soon, so Twilight moved on to Rarity.</p><p class="double">“When I said Prince Blueblood wasn&#039;t your type, I didn&#039;t mean you weren&#039;t good enough for him, I meant the opposite. Spike will back me up on this,” and a glance at the dragon showed he was nodding vigorously. “He&#039;s efficient, I&#039;ll give him that. No-pony else could combine such stupidity, arrogance, narcissism and inability to admit any other point of view than his exists, let alone has any validity, in one pony. In fact,” a grin flashed across Twilight’s face, “it would normally take three. I would not set my worst enemy up on a date with him, let alone one of my dearest friends.”</p><p class="double">Twilight could remember how Blueblood had treated Rarity originally, and in some of her earlier loops had found out far more about him than she wanted to know.</p><p class="double">“<i>However,</i> I&#039;ve decided that I shouldn&#039;t assume any pony is beyond help, even Blueblood.” After all, miracles happened – and that wasn’t an entirely sarcastic thought, either, what with one redeemed deity and another. “Also, I think you&#039;d be the one pony who&#039;d enjoy the gala for what it is. So what I&#039;m going to do is give you a chance to study him and decide for yourself before the Gala. You said when we first met you wanted to go to Canterlot and enjoy the sophisticated atmosphere. I should have seen I could help with that long before now.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s going to take time to arrange, but Princess Celestia has agreed to let you stay at the palace for a couple of weeks, in the East Tower. It&#039;s normally used by visiting ambassadors, so it should be comfy enough.” Vast understatement. “I&#039;ll write to Cadence and let her know you&#039;re coming, I&#039;m sure she&#039;ll want to meet one of my new friends, and she&#039;s about the friendliest pony I know.</p><p class="double">“Spike knows more ponies outside the Royal family, as Princess Celestia brought him up after I hatched him. I was thinking of asking him to go as <i>your </i>assistant.” She turned to Spike. “You know Hoity Toity, don&#039;t you?”</p><p class="double">Spike hadn&#039;t been privy to this wrinkle, and was over the moon. “YES! I mean yes, after I helped him out with the thing at the place. I know High Hat, Fancy Pants, Diamond Dust... all the ponies any-pony should know! But don&#039;t you want me here as your assistant?”</p><p class="double">It was clear he was torn between going with Rarity and worrying Twilight didn&#039;t need him any more. She gave him a gentle smile. “Oh Spike, I&#039;ll always need you, but I can manage for a few days on my own. If things become desperate, I&#039;m sure I can come ask for help.”</p><p class="double">Rarity was still stunned at the idea of staying at the palace and getting personal introductions to the most important ponies in Canterlot. “I... East Tower... Princess... oh, my...”</p><p class="double">She collapsed backwards in a swoon with a smile that looked like it would have to be surgically removed. Twilight manifested a fainting couch to catch her.</p><p class="double">“Well, that went well.” Twilight grinned. “Rarity, eyes on the prize, or rather Prince Blueblood!” (Still a prize, though usually with the word ‘buffoon’ appended to the end.)</p><p class="double">That got her unfainted in a hurry. The purple unicorn continued. “The idea is to give you a way into Canterlot society, and go to the same sort of events he goes to. You&#039;ll be able to watch him and make your own decisions, and in the meantime, I&#039;m sure you can promote your skills and get lots of dress orders as well. So when you go to the ball, it won&#039;t be as some unknown, but as the exclusive fashionista Rarity. So even if Blueblood turns out to be unsalvageable, you&#039;ll still enjoy the night to its fullest.”</p><p class="double">“Oh Twilight!” Rarity gasped, “It&#039;s more than I ever dreamed!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned her attention to Fluttershy. “I can get you in to the Royal Gardens a lot sooner than the Gala, if you&#039;re willing to accept some restrictions. The problem is, the animals in there aren&#039;t as... well, they&#039;ve all lived in the gardens their entire lives and they&#039;re not used to strange ponies as your animal friends. If you just appeared, you might scare them off before they could get to know you.”</p><p class="double">“Oh my, that would be terrible!” Fluttershy gasped. “But I&#039;m sure I could get them to come to me if I just treat them gently.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe,” Twilight replied, knowing otherwise – Fluttershy’s talent was one thing, but for animals that delicate it would take weeks to work on its own. “But if you want to visit them, you&#039;ll have to do it in the company of Mr Greenhooves, the palace gardener. I think you&#039;ll like him, he&#039;s… sort of your counterpart for the palace gardens. I think he knows every animal there by name. With him along, he can help you overcome any timidity they show. By the night of the gala, you&#039;ll be familiar to them, and you should be able to enjoy the blooming without a problem.”</p><p class="double">“Well, if I have to...” Fluttershy said in a slightly downcast tone.</p><p class="double">“Trust me; I want this to be the best night ever for you, which is why I&#039;m not leaving anything to chance. Though there is one other pony you may meet. Princess Luna spends a lot of time in the gardens, in the evening at least.”</p><p class="double">“Princess Luna?” Fluttershy asked nervously. “She won&#039;t be... mad at me?”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, rather theatrically. “Right now even getting mad would be an improvement. I&#039;ve been corresponding with Princess Celestia, I kind of felt responsible as I was directing the Elements of Harmony when we freed her. She still feels really guilty about Nightmare Moon, about what she did, she&#039;s not a happy pony. I guess there&#039;s no way she could be after what she&#039;s gone through. She&#039;s hiding away from things. Princess Celestia is worried about her, and I am too. She&#039;s back to her original form physically, but she&#039;s nowhere near ready to take back her duties.”</p><p class="double">Twilight could see Pinkie ready to explode, and cut the fuse.</p><p class="double">“Pinkie, normally you&#039;d be perfect for cheering her up, but for now she needs some-pony less... energetic. What she really needs right now is a friend, somepony who won&#039;t judge her, won&#039;t try to force her to be anything she isn&#039;t ready for. That&#039;s why I&#039;d hoped if Fluttershy met her, she might be the right pony to bring her out of her shell.”</p><p class="double">“Oh! Oh! Has she turned into a snail?” Pinkie asked. “Is that why you need Fluttershy to talk to her?”</p><p class="double">“No she hasn&#039;t, but she needs gentleness right now.” She turned back to the pegasus. “Fluttershy, you don&#039;t have to if you don&#039;t want to, in fact I can make sure your visits are scheduled so you don&#039;t, but if ever there was a job for the Element of Kindness, this is it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight felt slightly guilty, she knew what buttons to push, and engaging Fluttershy&#039;s &#039;mother to all things living&#039; reflex and pointing it at Princess Luna could be considered manipulation of the worst sort. But it should be so good for both of them. With Fluttershy&#039;s support, Princess Luna would hopefully recover much sooner than she originally had, and having someone like Luna as a friend should help Fluttershy&#039;s confidence no end.</p><p class="double">She could see the subtle changes, the straightening of the wings, the slight narrowing of the eyes, and knew the bait had been well and truly taken. Fluttershy was now on a mission.</p><p class="double">Finally, she turned to Pinkie. “I&#039;m sorry, there&#039;s no way to make over the Gala into the kind of festival you described. It&#039;s a fancy formal ball, and that&#039;s what all the other guests will want. It may not be what you or I consider fun, but it is to them. I can get you books on what the Gala is supposed to be like, but I can&#039;t do anything more about it.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry Twilight!” Pinkie beamed. “There&#039;s no kind of party I can&#039;t handle!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m trying to get you a chance to help out at the Hearth&#039;s Warming Eve celebrations at the castle, which will be <i>exactly</i> that sort of festival you want. We can all go together, and I&#039;m sure with your unique touches, it will be the best Hearth&#039;s Warming Eve ever!”</p><p class="double">At that Pinkie <i>did </i>explode in a burst of streamers, and started bouncing around. “Two parties for the price of one! Of course, we&#039;re not paying admission so that&#039;s still zero, but this will be so super-duper-fantastically-amazing.”</p><p class="double">Twilight relaxed, it seemed she&#039;d succeeded. Every-pony seemed happy, and if she&#039;d advanced things several months for most of them, that just meant they&#039;d have more time afterwards to enjoy the memories.</p><p class="double">“Uh, Twilight?” Applejack spoke, and Twilight worried that she&#039;d left something out. “I think we all owe you a huge apology. You went to all this trouble, and after the way we squabbled over that durned ticket. You didn&#039;t need to do this. We&#039;re your friends, through thick and thin, and that ain&#039;t gonna change.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I did.” Twilight was relieved. “I know you&#039;re all my friends, and what I did wasn&#039;t some kind of trick to get you to like me more. I just want the very best for my friends, I didn&#039;t think you could get what you wanted from the Gala, and I just happened to have the ability to make sure that you could get it some other way. It isn&#039;t like I&#039;ve given it any of you on a silver plate, you&#039;ll still each have to work to get what you want, but I could help you along, and that&#039;s what friends are supposed to do.”</p><p class="double">A tea pot floated out of the kitchen, followed by a box of the Cakes&#039; finest cakes. “Now let&#039;s have some tea, and enjoy just being friends.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">12.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You did what.”</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged helplessly. “He asked!”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “<i>What</i> did he ask?”</p><p class="double">“He asked me what would be a good idea for a story, and I told him about one of those Transformers Loops. Then he got all excited, and started writing.” Dash pointed. “He’s over there. Scorch Mark, I think his name was.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, looking the unicorn over. He seemed entirely too excitable…</p><p class="double">“Ah, there you are!”</p><p class="double">Before she could fully process his words, he’d hurried over. “I love this story! Do you know anypony who could help with the special effects? I changed a few things, of course, because doing giant robots is a little bit harder to make work than magical transforming beings, but…”</p><p class="double">Twilight picked up the script – surprisingly complete, given he’d only had lunch to work on it. “Transfor<i>mares</i>?” She opened it and skimmed through. “This… actually, it’s not as bad as I’d feared…”</p><p class="double">“I could help with the cool explosions!” Dash volunteered. “I love them!”</p><p class="double">“Hmm…” Twilight pondered. “I could go find Trixie. She’s good with this kind of thing too. Especially explosions. And Rarity’s always good for costumes.”</p><p class="double">“The only problem is who would fund such a film,” Scorch Mark said, slumping slightly. “Making convincing transformations is going to be <i>very</i> expensive…”</p><p class="double">“Actually…” Twilight slowly smiled. “I have an idea that could save money.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hello, Queen Chrysalis of the Changelings. My name is Twilight Sparkle, and I’m helping with the production of a film which could use your talents and those of your hive. As such, I’ve negotiated with the director and producer to secure their approval to offer you a very lucrative contract, with ten percent of the gross being transferred to your hive and with sundry other benefits.”</p><p class="double">“…what?” Chrysalis managed, staring at the purple unicorn who’d materialized in her inner sanctum.</p><p class="double">“By sundry benefits, I include but do not limit the description involved to the fact that you and all other Changelings will become film stars, resulting in an overall highly positive opinion of your race and making it much more easy for you to sustain yourselves. Any transformation for which a given changeling requires more magic than they currently possess will be facilitated by our Kindness and Laughter assistant directors, who specialize in positive feelings,” Twilight rattled off.</p><p class="double">“And you want us to…” Chrysalis read through the contract in front of her, feeling <i>very</i> confused. “…be actors in a film? Where we change from normal ponies into giant beasts which fight one another?”</p><p class="double">“One set of them the villains, the other set the heroes,” Twilight confirmed. “Remember, amongst the benefits there’s that you’ll end up able to integrate with the ponies of Equestria freely, and that ponies will have overall positive opinions towards you.”</p><p class="double">“…this bears some thought…” Chrysalis mused.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy staggered out of the movie theatre, and collapsed onto a bench. “I feel… overwhelmed…”</p><p class="double">Dash and Pinkie left next, excitedly talking about the premiere. “So awesome!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” Pinkie bounced. “And was that big blast of prism dragonbreath-”</p><p class="double">“You bet it was! Sonic Rainboom, perfectly timed!”</p><p class="double">Spike hurried out with a big box of popcorn, entirely finished. He was keeping it because he was on the side – Twilight had managed to make his ‘Spike-Zilla’ transformation controllable, so he was one of the biggest monsters in the film.</p><p class="double">Rarity took off her earmuffs. “I <i>knew</i> these were a good idea! That film was very impressive, but just <i>so</i> loud!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Applejack agreed. “Still, it was kinda cool seeing all o’ them giant monster fights.”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know if you’ve heard,” Twilight said to Trixie, as they left last of their group, “But he’s already started work on a second script. He wants Princess Luna to get involved.”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Trixie still had a flush from excitement – seeing hundreds of ponies loving <i>her</i> work was an amazing thrill. (And the huge amount of bits she was going to get from the film wouldn’t hurt, either…) “What is this one about?”</p><p class="double">“Not sure yet. Probably going to have even more explosions, though, so you and Dash won’t be out of work.” Twilight winked. “I do have the title, though. <i>Transformares: Dark of the Moon.</i>”</p><p class="double">She’d finally worked out what was going on, after checking her extensive collection of fiction from the hub-loop. They’d found a pony variant of Michael Bay.</p><p class="double"><i>No wonder he got on so well with Trixie and Dash…</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">12.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey… Spike?”</p><p class="double">Spike turned, nearly knocking over a shelf with his tail. “Whoops… what is it, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Well, two things. First… don’t you think you’re overdoing it a bit?” Twilight pointed. “I mean, you’re kind of… big…”</p><p class="double">Ever since Twilight had showed Spike how to adjust his own relative age (and hence size), he’d taken to growing at least three feet right as they arrived in Ponyville – usually overnight – and calling it a growth spurt.</p><p class="double">“Maybe. If this doesn’t work, I’ll go back down a notch.” Spike shrugged. “What was the other thing?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’ve been meaning to ask… why is it that you like Rarity?” Twilight winced, and tried to clarify. “That might have come out wrong. What I was actually asking was… okay, first time around when we turned up in Ponyville, it seemed like a crush, and… you know. But you’re older now, and…” Twilight made a helpless gesture. “I don’t know how to put it.”</p><p class="double">“No, I get you.” Spike carefully manoeuvred around the stacked returns and headed for the kitchen. “I’ll make some tea.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, so you’re kind of right.” Spike passed Twilight her tea. (Earl Bay.) “It did start off as just a crush – like with Moondancer, in Canterlot. But…”</p><p class="double">Spike stopped, and sighed. “It’s hard to put. I think it really got started back when I had that…greed growth incident.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded sympathetically.</p><p class="double">“See… I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but Rarity isn’t a particularly nice pony, by nature.” Spike waved his claws, as if to fend off disagreement. “Let me finish. Her first instinct is always for herself – stealing some of a dragon’s hoard, or how well she’s doing with her dresses, or how much she’d love to be a model… but – and it’s a big but, a big, glorious-”</p><p class="double">“Get on with it,” Twilight mock-growled. “Or I’ll start thinking there’s an extra t in there.”</p><p class="double">“You got me.” Spike grinned. “Anyway. Her first instinct is for herself, but she <i>knows</i> that and she tries as hard as she can to overcome it. Even when she’s not Awake, you can see it – and the Looping Rarity has pushed it so far back you could barely tell it was there.”</p><p class="double">The dragon paused, and blushed. “Is it strange that I <i>really</i> like a mare with self control? The kind of self control that could make a dragon into an altruist?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight said flatly, and Spike chuckled at her tone. Inside, however, she was making all sorts of realizations.</p><p class="double">“…she reminds you of you, doesn’t she?” Twilight said softly. “Or who you want to be, I don’t know. Somepony – someone, I suppose – who’s got the control to restrain their darker impulses.”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much.” Spike shrugged. “There’s other bits, too – she’s smart, graceful, we like a lot of the same things and she <i>does</i> look very good, but what I just said is kind of the core.”</p><p class="double">“And you know it’s real because of her Element,” Twilight continued.</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Mind you,” Spike momentarily let a flame-gem in a golden gorget flash into being around his neck, “I’ve got one too…”</p><p class="double">“You’re really proud of that, aren’t you?” Twilight could remember when he’d got it. A very, very strange Loop where Spike – as a young adult dragon – had replaced Rainbow Dash as local weather coordinator, Element of Harmony et cetera. (It turned out he really <i>was</i> the new Rainbow Dash, for certain values of ‘new’. Though Ponyville had had a suspiciously arid climate that Loop…)</p><p class="double">Spike nodded, his hand going to where it had been. “It’s kind of the… proof, I suppose, that I’m doing things right.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">12.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…aaaaaaaAAARGH!” Applebloom screamed, and ran out of the class.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo put up a hoof. “Miss Cheerilee? Shall Sweetie and I go get Applebloom back?”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee nodded tiredly. “Fine. Just go ahead. I’ll expect you to do well on the history test next week, though…”</p><p class="double">The other two fillies shot out after their friend.</p><p class="double">“And as for <i>you</i>, miss Tiara, you’re going to take notes for poor Applebloom,” Cheerilee continued.</p><p class="double">“But I only-”</p><p class="double">“I know all you said was that she didn’t have a cutie mark, and I don’t know why she reacted so strongly.” Cheerilee dropped some extra sheets of paper in front of the pink filly. “But she <i>did</i>. So get writing. And I’m going to check them afterwards to be sure they’re good ones.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara gave an exaggerated sigh, and started writing down notes about the founding. Cheerilee stayed another moment to see how they were going, then nodded. Not bad, actually… Tiara did good schoolwork, and got along fairly well with the rest of the class most of the time, but something about her and the ‘crusaders’ just kept striking sparks.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo bounced over a hill, using her wings to control her jump even if she couldn’t fly with them. “Over here!”</p><p class="double">Sweetie came over the slight rise next, and the two of them sat down on either side of Applebloom.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what is it?” Sweetie asked.</p><p class="double">“I just… gaah!” Applebloom kicked the ground. “If she was just an idiot I could ignore her. It’d be hard, but I could. But… I keep thinking of that second Marecross Loop.”</p><p class="double">The others nodded, understanding. Flight Coordinator Diamond Tiara had run her squadron with a rod of iron, browbeating them in public over the slightest mistake… and had brought eleven out of twelve pilots out the other side of the war alive. That was a little over half the entire surviving roster from the <i>six</i> squadrons on board.</p><p class="double">“She was a bitch, but she was a bitch for a reason,” Scootaloo agreed. “I hated it when she was tearing me apart over that flubbed transformation timing, but if we’d done it against the Zentraedi…”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Applebloom made an explosive gesture with her hooves. “Bang, zoom, right to the moon. And when that isn’t coming up, it’s the time she ended up in charge when the machines attacked… you know, the metal-changeling-things?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” Sweetie agreed. “I think I’m seeing why you left.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” Applebloom shook her head. “Every time there’s serious trouble, she rises to the occasion like she was born to it! And then she goes back to being the petty, small minded <i>jerk</i> we’re used to.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe we could ask Twilight to have Nightmare Moon win next time, to see what happens,” Scootaloo suggested idly.</p><p class="double">Then the Crusaders exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Actually…” Applebloom said, slowly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Diamond tiara action!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon flinched backwards as the spinning item of jewellery came close to her face.</p><p class="double">Below the rooftop that Applebloom and the other Crusaders were hiding on, a battle was taking place. Golden Voice, Silver Spoon, Platinum Star and the other Jewelry Scouts were devastating dozens of moon-born creatures of the night, while their leader – Diamond Tiara – kept Nightmare Moon herself at bay.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…ah think we got a defective Loop…” Applebloom said, watching in stunned amazement.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Scootaloo concurred. “It’s like somepony took a Sailor Moon Loop and reversed the naming theme.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">12.5 (Lord of Bones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia backpedalled in fright as her student was consumed in a pillar of seething violet fire. Around her, the court assembly panicked as they heard the roar of a dragon just before the entire palace shook, as though a small earthquake had hit it. The sides of a vast pair of spread wings were easily visible outside, considering they blotted out the sunlight streaming in from between the pillars and windows.</p><p class="double">The firestorm in the audience chamber slowly died away, revealing an alicorn only slightly smaller than Celestia herself. An armoured brace ran from the base of the glowing black horn down her neck, with a cuirass of the same metal protecting her chest. Both wings blazed like fire; one the feathery wing of a pegasus, the other the bat wing of a thestral. Her mane and tail were clouds of hissing violet flame, and her hooves were shod in silver.</p><p class="double">On her flank, the deep purple of Twilight&#039;s cutie mark glowed malevolently.</p><p class="double">Her former student spread her wings and opened sultry violet eyes. &quot;I am queen of the end of day and the beginning of night! Here I say, and so it is truth, that I shall rule! Bow, my little ponies, for the Hour of Twilight has come! <i>THE DUSK SHALL LAST FOREVER!&quot; </i>Her voice thundered as the Bearers of Harmony flanked her, all grown to her size and just as darkly beautiful.</p><p class="double">There was a dull &quot;thud!&quot;, and both assembly and nightmares turned to the sight of Princess Celestia passed out from shock next to a slack-jawed Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;…too much?&quot; Twilight asked meekly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">12.6</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For once, Twilight woke up in bed.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait a minute</i>, the lavender pony thought as she stirred, <i>that’s not quite right. Er… for once, I’ve started the Loop in a bed. That’s much less ambiguous.</i></p><p class="double">Delicate matter of nomenclature thus resolved, she crawled out of bed and looked around.</p><p class="double"><i>Er, wow…</i></p><p class="double">The room was expensively decorated, to put it mildly. Nothing <i>too</i> excessive, certainly not opulent, but the simple cut of the furnishings – which were made with fine cashmere and velvet and dyed in her precise coat and mane colours – was a statement in and of itself. And the deep pile carpet was another.</p><p class="double">She did a quick check, discovering that she was an alicorn this loop. Further investigation revealed that a number of familiar looking dresses were hanging in the closet, and her Magic tiara was resting on the dresser atop a pile of books.</p><p class="double"><i>Now, if only my Loop memories would return…</i></p><p class="double">Someone knocked on the door. “You up yet, Twily?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, just a minute!” Twilight called back automatically, then blinked. Apparently she was still living with her parents. Which meant something unusual was going on this Loop…</p><p class="double">“Okay, but hurry up,” the voice continued. Twilight frowned, because despite it being male she couldn’t quite identify it – it certainly wasn’t her father’s, but the door distorted it, “or I’ll have to reverse gravity in there to make sure you’re not still in bed!”</p><p class="double">At that precise moment, the memories arrived.</p><p class="double">“Oh, buck me…” Princess Twilight Sparkle, Princess of Trottingham, younger child of King Discord and Queen Celestia, said to herself.</p><p class="double">Not only were she and Crown Prince the Prince of Horseshoe Bay Shining Armor (both alicorns, as it happened) the children of Discord and Celestia – who <i>had</i> taken kingdom titles, for whatever reason – but several other familiar faces were also turning up in various important positions.</p><p class="double">Princess Luna, for example, was the former heir to Equestria’s throne, but was now third in the line of succession after her sister had produced two children. For her part, she was as of yet unmarried – something of a blessing for Twilight, who was starting to wonder if the alicorn of the night would have been married to Angel Bunny or something. Or Blueblood… shiver. (He was, as it happened, a duke this time – duke of Canterlot. And one without any blemishes on his record of service. Either this was a different Blueblood or he was planning something.)</p><p class="double">Furthermore, the nearest other kingdom was Amoria. Ruled by – Twilight was almost expecting this – King Sombra and Queen Chrysalis, though the fact that <i>their</i> daughter was Cadence was a completely new twist. Oh, and then there was the fact that Spike was pulling his occasional “ruler of the Griffins” trick, and that there had been several border incidents between Equestria and Amoria in the last few years.</p><p class="double">It was obvious what the Loop had planned for her.</p><p class="double">“<i>Politics…”</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Shiny.” Twilight walked into her brother’s room, noticing the same combination of tasteful and insanely expensive that marked her own room – though with the addition of maps and a complete suit of armour piled in various places around it. “Please tell me that the word ‘anchor’ means something to you.”</p><p class="double">Her brother blinked, then grinned. “Yep. This is one hay of a strange Loop, isn’t it?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight pulled two bottles of Applejack’s finest cider out of her subspace pocket, then blinked at Shining. “Do you want one?”</p><p class="double">“Er… okay.” Shining watched, bemused, as Twilight pulled a third bottle out, levitated it across to him and then started on the first of the two she was apparently going to have.</p><p class="double">After a long draught of apples – well, mainly apples – Twilight felt a lot more alicorn. “Okay. What happens now?”</p><p class="double">“Seems fairly obvious.” Shining’s grin could have lit up the room. “Two words, little sister. Dynastic marriage.”</p><p class="double">“…<i>oh.</i>” Twilight managed a weak smile. “Okay, I suppose that is a good thing on your part, then. You and Cadence, just like every time.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly. You know, you should find a somepony for yourself,” Shining ventured.</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Twilight shook her head. “Most other Loopers are female, which… just doesn’t really interest me. The rest are Spike – who is spoken for – and Discord, who doesn’t loop often anyway and who I didn’t have an interest in even <i>before</i> he became my <i>dad</i> for this loop.” She took another drink of the cider. “Good thing this stuff is non alcoholic.”</p><p class="double">“Er…” Shining raised a hoof. “How long has that been in your subspace pocket?”</p><p class="double">“…oh, right. I wondered what the extra tang was.” Twilight levitated a drop out of the bottle and put it on a spatula, which promptly dissolved. “Huh. Probably best not to drink much more of that now, then.”</p><p class="double">“I’d say so.” Shining nodded. “And I can see you’ve put some considerable thought into this, so I won’t press you on it. Anyway, I’m going to get dad-”</p><p class="double">“La la la!” Twilight interjected.</p><p class="double">“Look, we have to get used to calling him that for now, okay?” The elder, male, alicorn wondered just how strong that cider actually was, watching his little sister bounce around the room with her hooves over her ears. “Right. Okay. So, I’ll make sure a message is sent asking about the possibility, because quite frankly when we turned up things were on the slippery slope to a war.”</p><p class="double">“Cool.” Twilight nodded. “Well done, Shining, for preventing a war by getting nookie. Anyway, I’m going to go to the library.” She spread her wings, and Shining caught her tail in a telekinetic grip.</p><p class="double">“No flying while drunk, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“No fair.” Twilight pouted, then began walking to the library instead.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna, Princess of Manehattan, stomped into the throne room. “Thy younger child, mine sister, has taken a quarter of the books in the library and removed them to her room.”</p><p class="double">“…oh.” Queen Celestia frowned. “Can’t you get her to give them back?”</p><p class="double">“She is.” Luna shook her head wearily, and the rulers noticed a bruise on it. “She’s throwing them back out, with little slips saying ‘finished’ on them, at a rate that approximates to three per minute.”</p><p class="double">King Discord nudged his wife. “Told you that my side would come through eventually!”</p><p class="double">There was a small explosion, and the castle shook.</p><p class="double">Luna rolled her eyes. “If my liege will excuse me, I suspect that that may have been the distillery I saw her setting up.”</p><p class="double">Celestia buried her head in her hooves. “And she was doing <i>so</i> well…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, this is a new experience,” Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">Her brother shrugged. “Next time, make sure to put stasis spells on magically potent drinks, or they’ll turn into magically potent <i>alcohol.</i>”</p><p class="double">This time they were in her room, and Twilight was busily writing an essay. The theme was ‘why princesses should not brew volatile alcohol in their rooms’. (That was from her mother. Her father had added to that punishment, but also given her three gold stars and a new bathroom.)</p><p class="double">“Still.” Twilight finished the current paragraph with a flourish, and cast a word-count spell. Nine thousand, two hundred and fifty three words.</p><p class="double">“Cheer up!” Shining said, nudging her. “Only another thirty-one thousand to go.”</p><p class="double">Twilight suspected she’d have gotten off lighter if the scumble hadn’t gang-detonated and blown her outside wall clean off the castle…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Your majesty,” Blueblood raised a hoof, “There is one more matter, now that the vows have been taken.”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Celestia replied, with a smile. Blueblood had been very helpful in getting the wedding organized, so this was hardly unusual.</p><p class="double">“Well, this needs to be a bit more of a <i>Blue</i> wedding.” There was a sudden flash of steel, and a dagger emerged from his tuxedo. Dozens of ponies charged into the room, wielding weapons, and a goodly number of the guests also drew steel. The dozen griffins around Emperor Spykoran looked around warily.</p><p class="double">“You see,” Blueblood continued in the sudden stillness, “I’ve always wondered what it feels like, sitting on a throne. And now I get the change to have three at once.”</p><p class="double">Twilight started laughing. “You’re a <i>moron.</i>”</p><p class="double">“What?” Blueblood turned, stung. “It’s valid! So long as I kill you all in the right order, so that the two lovebirds technically inherit, and then I kill them too, since I have a position in the line of succession I can legally obtain the twin crowns. And the griffins give the throne to whoever kills the previous Emperor.”</p><p class="double">“No, not that!” Twilight fell over, rolling around on the floor in paroxysms of hilarity. Between the gasps of laughter, she managed to get out, “You just tried to assassinate eight <i>deities</i> and a greater dragon!”</p><p class="double">Blueblood turned back to Celestia, who was by this point glowing a dull yellow with heat. “Ah. Er… parley?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Good suggestion, Twilight!” the king of Equestria said, grinning. “I never thought of using the moon as a holding cell.”</p><p class="double">“So long as thou dost get them off mine satellite soon…” Luna said, less happy about the whole thing.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I had an idea for that, too.” Twilight levitated up a map. “Here. The island of San Equus. No pony habitation there, the griffins never run trade lines that far south and there’s enough grass to keep them alive.” The young alicorn’s grin grew malicious. “Why not even make it an independent kingdom? See how many of them are content with being bossed around by <i>Blueblood.</i>”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis matched her daughter-in-law’s grin. “I like it. Poetic justice.”</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>13.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p><u><b>Calling out the Cutie - Revenge of the Everfree</b></u></p><p><hr></p><p>Diamond Tiara cursed as she pushed her way through the underbrush. This whole thing was turning into an even more massive debacle than her original actions. Why couldn&#039;t that rotten little farm filly have known her place and been properly humiliated? Instead, she&#039;d turned the tables with her preposterous speech and gotten the entire class on her side, making it look as if it was Diamond Tiara who was in the wrong.</p><p class="double">Obviously, this set of circumstances couldn&#039;t be allowed to stand. There was no way one pony could know all those things, especially a blank flank loser like Applebloom. So Diamond Tiara had challenged her to back up her boasts. When it started to snowball, and turn into something the whole of Ponyville had gotten interested in, Diamond Tiara had felt smug – after all, what was the point of letting somepony lie to you? <i>This</i> would teach her a lesson.</p><p class="double">But the annoying bumpkin had so far gone through the tests set up for her without a bobble. She&#039;d fixed up a broken wheel and damaged harness on a two wheeled farm cart, then slipped into the harness and hauled it back and forth over the back forty of Sweet Apple Acres under the watchful timer of Time Turner.</p><p class="double">Building a wooden wall from the planks and supplies she&#039;d brought in the cart, then raising a single room sized barn and roofing it using parts she claimed to have made earlier, using the rest of the supplies to build some training dummies that she then enthusiastically demolished under the watchful eye of that crazy old earth pony Temple Fortress.</p><p class="double">That was the <i>other </i>annoying thing, the number of ponies who seemed to spring out of the ground to help run her through her tests. After finishing off the dummies, she fought a couple of other students from his dojo, and beat them, though she was sure it had all been a set up despite the assurance that they wouldn&#039;t going easy on her. Seeing her sweeping the legs out from under a stallion half against her size and holding him to the floor with a &#039;Mountain stance&#039;, it had to be! (Though they had made noises about her using skill to compensate for relative lack of strength, whatever that meant.)</p><p class="double">Which brought them into the Everfree forest. Applebloom was up ahead with Miss Cheerilee and Zecora, identifying plants and picking some of them for later use in showing her brewing skills. Diamond Tiara growled again. Who could tell if that gibberish the two had spouted at each other was a language? But it had impressed Cheerilee. That was why Diamond Tiara was following them. She had to do something to sabotage Applebloom, before she succeeded and humiliated Diamond Tiara again. Anyway, there had to be something behind a curtain somewhere, right?</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been a bit nervous about following them into the Everfree, but so far it hadn&#039;t been any different to walking through Whitetail Woods, a bit darker and creepier, but nothing like the horror stories she&#039;d heard. Of course, that blank flank did it, so it couldn&#039;t be that hard. She strained to hear what they were talking about up ahead, and trampled her way through the large patch of blue flowers without even thinking about it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara woke up from a nightmare, remembered what had happened yesterday, and wished she was back in it. As if watching Applebloom cook and bake and brew potions wasn&#039;t bad enough, it hadn&#039;t been Twilight who&#039;d come to test her knowledge of stars and navigation. Princess Luna herself had shown up. Apparently Twilight had been telling tales, and the description of this contest had piqued her interest.</p><p class="double">Applebloom, of course, had somehow weaselled her way through Princess Luna&#039;s questions. It had been evening when they started, and Luna had raised the moon, then started switching around the star patterns to test if Applebloom could identify the time of year… which, of course, she could.</p><p class="double">Now she&#039;d have to go to school and face the class as the neighsayer who had been made to look like a fool by the foul farm filly. She rolled out of bed, grappling for her comb as she turned to look at herself in her palatial room&#039;s full length mirror.</p><p class="double">The scream was audible in Canterlot.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom had finished her morning chores and was just getting ready for school when there were angry voices from outside, near the gate. She grabbed a last piece of toast in her mouth as she trotted out to see what all the hoo-ha was about. As soon as she came in sight of the gate, there was a scream of &quot;There she is!&quot; and some more raised voices.</p><p class="double">Applejack and her big brother were at the gate, talking or rather arguing with a bunch of ponies led by Filthy Rich, and centred on Diamond Tiara.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re plumb crazy! What makes you think that Applebloom had anything to do with it?&quot; Applejack asked, as angry as Applebloom had ever heard her – well, when there wasn’t some kind of invasion going on, anyway.</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s been humiliating me ever since I teased her about that blank flank. This is her latest revenge, another way to punish me!&quot; Diamond Tiara sobbed.</p><p class="double">&quot;We did see her brew up magic potions yesterday, so… &quot; Filthy Rich began.</p><p class="double">Applejack got right in his face. &quot;Finish that sentence and you can forget ever getting another jar of zap apple jam. Applebloom would never do something like that!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom swallowed the last bite of toast and asked, &quot;What the hay am I being accused of? Before you bring out the boiling oil, I&#039;d at least like to know why.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This, you rotten little peasant!&quot; Diamond Tiara presented her flank, which was as unblemished as the day she was born.</p><p class="double">Applebloom couldn&#039;t help it, she burst out laughing.</p><p class="double">&quot;You see!&quot; The pink pony growled.</p><p class="double">&quot;I… I&#039;m sorry…&quot; Applebloom chuckled. &quot;I had nothing to do with it, but whoever did it must have had a major sense of poetic justice. The queen of cutie-marks deposed… Hmmm… Hold on a second…&quot;</p><p class="double">She trotted over to Diamond Tiara, who tried to scramble back with an &#039;Eek!&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh stop it, I&#039;m not going to hurt you, I just need to smell something.&quot; She ducked her head towards Diamond Tiara&#039;s hooves and sniffed.</p><p class="double">&quot;What are you doing you freak!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Figurin&#039; out that you mosied on into the Everfree forest, and ran longwise through some blue flowers.&quot; Applebloom lifted her head and looked back at Applejack. &quot;Poison joke. Zecora told me all about it. It has a unique scent, and some <i>nasty</i> effects.&quot;</p><p class="double">Of course, looper Applejack would know perfectly well what poison joke was, but in-loop she had no reason to, hence the little piece of play acting.</p><p class="double">&quot;How could a flower make my daughter&#039;s cutie-mark vanish?&quot; asked Filthy Rich.</p><p class="double">&quot;It’s wild magic, it does what the name says, plays a nasty prank on any-pony that walks through it. She&#039;s lucky; you could have been turned into a diamond statue, or a duplicate of her own tiara.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lucky?&quot; Diamond Tiara was still sobbing. She threw her hoof to her forehead in a dramatic gesture worthy of Rarity. &quot;My life is ruined!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh stop with the drama. Zecora has a recipe for an antidote, you can be back to normal as soon as you take a dip in it. And I won&#039;t even ask why you were sneaking around after me in the forest. If there was ever a case of some-pony upsetting their own apple cart, this is it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s an antidote?&quot; Filthy Rich asked. &quot;Then you must fetch it at once!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack growled. &quot;So you were accusing my little sister of poisoning your daughter, but now she can help you change your tune.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion hung his head. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, I was just scared for my daughter&#039;s health. Please, help her!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded. &quot;Sure I will. But I&#039;m not missing school and chasing off into the Everfree right away. There&#039;s no further danger, she&#039;s just minus a cutie-mark for a bit.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t go to school like this!&quot; Diamond Tiara exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, you need a shower.&quot; Applebloom giggled. &quot;I&#039;ll go get Zecora as soon as school breaks for the afternoon.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">At the school it was a zoo. Rumour had apparently gotten there ahead of Diamond Tiara, though considering the fuss she&#039;d been making on the way to Sweet Apple Acres it wasn&#039;t hard to guess why. Normally, the pink pony would have been happy to be the centre of attention, but in this case, she was practically cringing at the fillies and colts looking at her.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d rushed home for a quick shower, then put on the dress she&#039;d had made up for her cute-cenera, which oddly enough covered her flanks, obscuring her cute mark, or rather where her cutie-mark should be. Considering the other ponies had come in their normal attire, i.e. buck naked, this only served to make her look dreadfully out of place. Even Silver Spoon didn&#039;t have a dress on, which made things worse.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara had dawdled at home, wanting to give the other ponies as little time as possible to interrogate her before class started, but that just seemed to have allowed a bigger crowd to gather. As well as her class mates there were ponies from the other classes that normally had their lessons at other times, and Applebloom, always Applebloom in the middle of it.</p><p class="double">She was chatting to that geek Twist, and a pair of other blank flanks, a unicorn and a pegasus who she&#039;d seen around. She hadn&#039;t bothered to learn their names, but that hadn&#039;t stopped her and Silver Spoon using all of them for verbal target practice several times in the past. After all, they&#039;d been easy targets. She&#039;d even managed to make Twist and the unicorn cry, which had been particularly satisfying.</p><p class="double">As she approached, the pegasus gave a smirk. “Ha! Not so high and mighty now, are you? I may not have my cutie-mark yet, but at least I&#039;m not afraid to show my flank!”</p><p class="double">She winced. So that was it, Applebloom had been getting together a group to continue to persecute her…</p><p class="double">“Scootaloo!” Applebloom exclaimed. “I may not like her any more than you do, but I ain&#039;t going to stand by and let any-pony get picked on because she has a blank flank! How do we expect to get any respect if we turn around and do the exact same thing?”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara growled back. “Don&#039;t play innocent, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve told the entire school what happened!”</p><p class="double">“Yep, I figured I should tell them about the poison joke before some-pony decided I&#039;d fed you some crazy potion, or Sweetie Belle had used Rarity&#039;s blemish concealment charm on you. Though considering the way you treated her last week, I wouldn&#039;t have been shocked if she had.”</p><p class="double">“I never thought of that!” The unicorn in question suddenly said, eyes wide.</p><p class="double">Applebloom gave her a quick hug with one fore-leg. “Just as well, that&#039;s the sort of mean trick she&#039;d play. Do you really want to drop to her level?”</p><p class="double">“No, but I&#039;d have liked to have seen <i>her</i> without her cutie-mark.”</p><p class="double">“C&#039;mon, she&#039;s already managed to embarrass herself far worse than any prank we could ever pull. Twist and I have to get to class. I&#039;ll be late to the club-house, I&#039;ve got to go ask Zecora to brew up an antidote for her.”</p><p class="double">The other three agreed and gave a four way high hoof. “Okay!” “See you then.” “Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho!”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s ears pricked up at that, and as they moved inside she sneered, “Ha! After all your talk, you&#039;re just as obsessed with getting a cutie-mark as any-pony! Or are you going to tell me that&#039;s not what your pathetic club of misfits is about?”</p><p class="double">That got her a sharp look from Miss Cheerilee, who&#039;d heard the tail end of her sentence. Twist cringed slightly, but Applebloom just shook her head.</p><p class="double">“Just because I think there&#039;s more to a pony than a cutie-mark, doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m not interested in seeing what mine is, if any. I guess I was when I started, but now it&#039;s as much a fun thing to do. We hang together at a tree-house on the farm, play games, go out trying different activities to see if we get a cutie-mark, and basically have fun. If we actually get a cutie-mark out of it, that&#039;s a bonus.”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “You’re focusing on the destination and ignoring the journey, at least that’s what my sister would say. Well actually, I figure you’re just feeling bad and wanting to spread it around, but it comes to the same thing.”</p><p class="double">Miss Cheerilee cleared her throat. “Every-pony, quieten down. I’ll take register, and then I think Applebloom should give a short explanation of just why it’s not a good idea to go into the Everfree forest without some-pony who knows what they’re doing. If then.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara just sat there and fumed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">13.2 (crossover with Spyro)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Wwwwwelcome to Magic Crafters!” Cosmo said, looking down at the purple dragon who had just freed him and stretching sinuously. “I want you to rrrelease the dragons, rrreclaim our treasure, and rrrecover the eggs from those pesky blue Thieves.”</p><p class="double">He disappeared in a flash of magic, leaving behind his pedestal.</p><p class="double">“Reclaim, huh?” Twilight the Flutterpony sniggered. “Yeah, bit late for that.”</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Spike the Dragon replied, looking hurt. “I’ve only eaten the tasty ones… it’s not my fault that they’re <i>all</i> tasty…”</p><p class="double">“Admittedly, I <i>do</i> wonder what Spyro usually does with all his.” Twilight hummed. “Hey, try not to fall off any more cliffs, okay? I can only save you so many times before I start to get tired.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, thanks for that.” Spike crouched down (easier than normal, because he was an all-up quadruped this time) and launched himself forward in a charge.</p><p class="double">Gnorcs in silly metal dresses went flying.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, Twilight!” Spike looked around, towards some sheep (which promptly fled) and then at a large portal. “I fancy a trip to the beach. Can you take me?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Twilight said. “You’re always making me teleport you everywhere, use the portal for once.”</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Spike grumbled, and gestured towards the portal to Dragon Shores. “Come on, then. And when are you going to work out how to get me to fly properly? Age-shifting doesn’t work here.”</p><p class="double">“When I work out how the Flights do it, that’s how. And no sooner.” Twilight did a loop-the-loop in irritation. “I can’t even READ here! The dragons’ books are all twelve feet tall, and I’m barely bigger than the words!”</p><p class="double">There was a tugging sensation as they passed through the Dragon Shores portal, and then they were in some strange, non-beach place with a cheetah, a faun and a mole talking at them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, look,” Twilight said. “We weren’t supposed to be here, so if you’d just-”</p><p class="double">“But we need your help to defeat Ripto!”</p><p class="double">Twilight picked up a fireball headed her way, and fed it through a one-way magical mirror – also, incidentally, pumping the energy in it up by a factor of a hundred.</p><p class="double">There was a loud explosion.</p><p class="double">“Okay? Can we go <i>now?</i>” Twilight did not like it when she was proven wrong by Spike, especially when his argument was actually based off not wanting to walk.</p><p class="double">“Uh…” the cheetah, Hunter, looked back and forth between her and the crater. “Did you-?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Spike shouted. “They have gems bigger than ME here! Let’s stay for a bit!”</p><p class="double">“…oh, alright. Maybe <i>here</i> they have books,” Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">“Oh, splendid!” the mole said. “I was wondering, do the portals you normally use follow a longitudinal or transverse wave pattern? Because I tried the first one, but it didn’t pick up well until I’d gone through transverse and back.”</p><p class="double">“A mix, actually.” Suddenly, Twilight was also an enthusiast for staying in Avalar. <i>At last, someone who has an intellectually stimulating task to work on!</i> “We use Rayleigh waveforms, because those allow for more specific origin points which can be in the air and… <i>oh</i>! So <i>that’s</i> how the Flight portals work – they must carry the superfly spell in the waveform!”</p><p class="double">“Splendid!” The studious mole took out a pencil and started writing that down. “We have a similar enchantment on the daises leading to Speedway portals, but that’s in the arch and not the warp torus itself.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight checked on Spike, and saw he was trying to get a gemstone almost as big as Princess Celestia out of the ground. “Okay, we tend to use Runcible-type gates with more flexibility on the waveform, but the downside is that the Horns of the Spoon take a lot more power… I did wonder why they bothered…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Don’t worry, Bianca,” Twilight said, the purple glow around her intensifying, “I’ll handle this. Hey, Spike!”</p><p class="double">“What?” the dragon asked, halfway through a game of Ancient Egyptian Tanks.</p><p class="double">“I managed to locate the Sorceress, so we can teleport straight to her. And I think I can apply Superflame, Superfly and Invincibility in the teleport flare.”</p><p class="double">Spike jumped out of the tank and was next to her in a second. “Cool. Let’s go.”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight’s glow became blinding for a moment.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And so, we say goodbye to the Forgotten Worlds,” Spike said with an affected voice. “Land of giant monsters, malfunctioning portals, stolen dragon eggs and ludicrous numbers of Rhynocs.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Wasn’t so bad, was it?”</p><p class="double">“Nah. Fun place, once you get past the occasional deathtrap or horde of giant scorpions.” Spike hopped through the portal, and Twilight followed a second later. “What now?”</p><p class="double">“I… guess we wait until the next disaster.” Twilight paused. “Well, <i>you</i> wait, anyway. I’m going to go try and work out how the Supercharge ramps work.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">13.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I don’t understand it,” Celestia said, shaking her head.</p><p class="double">The object of her confusion lay in the gardens of Canterlot palace. A three-hundred-foot-tall building, containing inside it a statue of herself – at thirty times normal scale.</p><p class="double">It had appeared overnight. And she had no idea where most of her gardens had gone…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, how flattering.” Luna looked around the huge building. The outside was covered with frescoes depicting her at her work of shaping the night sky, and the inside held silver sculptures of her surrounding a great replica moon.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Explain,” Firefly said flatly.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Dash raised her hooves. “This one totally wasn’t me. Anyway, why <i>would</i> I build a giant lighthouse out of clouds? It sounds like <i>far</i> too much effort for me.”</p><p class="double">After a moment, Raindrops nodded. “Yeah, it is. You’d have left it half finished.”</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Dash paused, then realized what she was objecting to. “I mean, er, yeah! Exactly my point.”</p><p class="double">“Only question is, then, who <i>did?</i>” Firefly said. “I mean, it’s helping pegasi find their way home, but these strange black insect-ponies calling themselves changelings keep bumping into the main mirror.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy flew up to get a closer look at the strange sight. “Oh, my.”</p><p class="double">A jet-black obelisk, covered with runes which glowed purple, jutted out of the Everfree forest canopy. And above it, held in a deep purple glow, hovered a magnificent garden – with rare animals and plants which she was <i>sure</i> were only supposed to be in the Canterlot palace gardens.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Was this your doing, Braeburn?” Sherrif Silver Star asked, pointing to the east.</p><p class="double">“Nope,” the Apple replied, shaking his head. “Weren’t me.”</p><p class="double">“Well, who <i>would</i> put four giant stone pyramids out here?” Silver Star squinted. “And that’s a griffin statue next to ‘em, too.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Down a bit… left a bit… and done!” Spike said, checking off the sixth item on the list.</p><p class="double">Twilight finished off by casting the spells that secured the enormous earth pony statue in place, and then dropped the cloaking spell. “Right. That’s the Colossus of Horseshoe Bay set up… now, one to go. Which one is it?”</p><p class="double">“The mausoleum.” Spike tapped his chin idly. “Not sure who to commemorate, really. I mean, most of our rulers are still around.”</p><p class="double">“…easy. The Founders.” Twilight frowned. “Only problem is finding where they were buried. Any ideas?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…anyway, we managed to get them all done inside the same twelve hour period,” Twilight finished. “With a lot of magic, anyway.”</p><p class="double">Discord clapped. “Very good, Twilight. Most impressive. So, you set up the Seven Wonders of Equestria? What was the reaction?”</p><p class="double">“…Celestia was a bit annoyed that I’d pinched her garden,” Twilight admitted. “But I had to move it anyway to put down the Temple of Celestia at Canterlot, so…” she shrugged. “Fluttershy was very happy.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">13.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “…Princess?” Twilight started at the unexpected sight. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“While I am grateful that you’ve made such good friends, Twilight,” Celestia said, stepping into the Ponyville library, “I must confess that I originally sent you to Ponyville for reasons that were not entirely altruistic.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, then.” Twilight frowned – was this connected to why Luna was over two months late? “Go on.”</p><p class="double">“It was my original intent to allow you to form friendships, it is true…” Celestia looked pained, “but that was in part due to the Elements of Harmony. They can only be wielded by a group of ponies with true friendship between them, and I feared the return of my sister – who has become Nightmare Moon.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I see, and I do understand the logic. But… I remember that book. Wasn’t Nightmare Moon supposed to return on the Summer Sun festival?”</p><p class="double">“She was.” Celestia nodded. “I was most impressed by how well you and your friends organized it, by the way – masterfully done. But the absence of my sister still troubles me.” The alicorn of the sun lit her horn. “Twilight… I ask a great favour of you. Will you accompany me to the moon where my sister has spent these last thousand years, so as to determine whether she is still there or has escaped without my notice?”</p><p class="double">The Element of Magic blinked. “Er, why me? I’m flattered, but…”</p><p class="double">“You are the pony I would trust more than any other, Twilight.” Celestia’s voice held a quiet serenity. “And, in truth, my sister and I are closely matched – your power would, perhaps, be enough to tip the balance.”</p><p class="double">Suppressing a grin at the private joke – if it came to it, she had <i>more</i> than enough power – Twilight nodded in turn. “Okay, then, Princess. I won’t let you down.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you.” The glow turned to a blinding flash.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia and Twilight materialized inside a gigantic frosted-glass dome.</p><p class="double">The ruler blinked, her air-bubble spell being completely unnecessary in the atmosphere already present in the dome. “I don’t remember this being here…”</p><p class="double">“Oh, hi!” said a voice from overhead, in the distant heights of the dome. There was a series of bright magical flashes, and the dome turned fully transparent.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as Princess Luna flew down, carrying a huge slab of quarry-fresh stone. “Celly! I haven’t seen you in SO long! And who’s this?”</p><p class="double">Celestia recovered her poise quite quickly. “Dearest sister. This is my student, Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">Twilight bowed. “It is an honour.”</p><p class="double">“I bet she’s a regular anchor of strength for you,” Luna said, and winked at Twilight. “Anyway, I got over the whole Nightmare thing about… three years after I came up here, and I’ve spent the rest of the time building. There’s a complete environmental dome here, which stretches out across about half the nearside.” Creating a series of illusions, Luna continued explaining. “I made the dome light-reactive so the sunlight isn’t too intense – that’s to compensate for the lack of the atmosphere – and the top surface has the Mare in the Moon motif. I know it might be interesting to have the whole thing transparent to emerging light so that the greenery I hope to transplant up here will be fully evident – imagine it, Celly, the moon having as many ponies and as much life on it as the planet below!”</p><p class="double">The long, rambling explanation by an evidently Awake Luna about what she’d done over the course of the last ten centuries wound on for about twenty more minutes. Twilight was impressed – Luna had not only built a habitable area rather larger than any one continent, but she’d also constructed future cities, towns and villages within it. Any prospective colonists would almost literally just have to move in.</p><p class="double">Celestia’s jaw was just getting gradually more slack.</p><p class="double">“…anyway,” the alicorn of the moon finished, “Why are you up here? I mean, it’s nice of you to visit, but…” she gasped and checked a moondial Pinkie had given her once. “Oh! I completely missed the date! Sorry, Celly, I hadn’t realized I could come down by now. Anyway. Do you want to write the colonist adverts or shall I?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">13.5 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u><b>Squeezing out the Competition</b></u></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “Well, looky what we got here, brother of mine, it&#039;s the same in every town, Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues, and not a drop of cider to be found…”</p><p class="double">Flim’s musical number came to a halt with the sound of a gramophone record needle scratch as he got a chance to look around at the road outside Sweet Apple Acres. Lots of ponies, all of them merrily drinking mugs of cider. One rainbow maned Pegasus had a pyramid of empty mugs in front of her, and another mug raised in salute to the stall which was clearly selling it.</p><p class="double">There were still barrels stacked behind the stall, and a massive pile of bits overflowing the cash box. The orange pony in the hat who seemed to be in charge of the stall looked over at them sourly. “I hope you can pay for that post you just knocked down.” </p><p class="double">“What in Equestria?” Flim couldn’t help saying. “We heard that there was a cider shortage here in Ponyville! That’s why we brought our unique and superb…” The music started up again. “Unseen at any time in this modern world, born of creativity.”</p><p class="double">Seeing ponies starting to pay attention, the two started trading off.</p><p class="double">“Folks it’s the one and only, the biggest and the best,”</p><p class="double">“The unbelievable,”</p><p class="double">“Unimpeachable”</p><p class="double">“Indispensable”</p><p class="double">“I can’t believ-able”</p><p class="double">“Flim and Flam Brothers’ Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.”</p><p class="double">The music came to a halt again as Applejack retorted, “That’s nice and all, but you’re a mite out of date. Last year we couldn’t produce enough cider, that’s true, and we wanted to do better without compromising on quality.”</p><p class="double">She waved back at the orchard behind her. “That’s why we got my friend Twilight in to do what she called a ‘time and motion study’. We were doing the whole process by hoof, even driving the apple press of a treadmill, and changing the full barrels for empties. Turns out the only stages which really needed to be pony-intensive was bucking the trees to get the right apples, and quality control on the apples to see that only the best get in. Takes a skilled pony to tell which apples are just right for our cider.”</p><p class="double">“Our machine has a selector that does it automatically, and turns it into grade-A top-notch five-star blow-your-horseshoes-off one-of-a-kind cider…” Flam stopped, turning. “Hey, get away from there!”</p><p class="double">Applebloom was tapping the wheel of their transport. “Huh, seems like a thaumic boiler system and a magically controlled spectro-mechanical analysis device feeding an undershaft powered processing line hooked up to a vacu-motive collector. Fast, but I bet it takes a lot of maintenance, not to mention a dedicated unicorn to power it. You’ll get maybe a couple of hours of use out of it before you have to tear it down for an overhaul. No wonder you were riding around looking to make a quick bit rather than trying to market it.”</p><p class="double">Applejack grinned. “Mah little sister Applebloom has a knack for mechanical dohickeys. She built our new cider processing system.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom pointed over to a long line of wooden struts and machinery half hidden by the trees.</p><p class="double">“Tain’t as fancy or mobile as your contraption, but it’s practically all mechanical, a simple conveyor system driven by an electric motor. Rather than a complex magical gadget, we just pre-filter using a simple feeder system onto a scale which drives a flipper that diverts the apple out of the process line if it’s obviously too light. With the pre-washing stage and stirrers running off the same drive shaft, we can remove any leaves and twigs that got that far too.</p><p class="double">“That allows Applejack and Big Mac to buck, and me and Granny Smith to check the apples that make it through the pre-filter. We have push button flippers to drop out bad apples rather than taking them off the conveyor by hoof, which saves a couple of seconds on each apple. May not sound like much, but over thousands of apples it adds up.” Applebloom shrugged. “It was the bottleneck for the whole process, so with the two of us working on it and the other improvements we&#039;ve managed to more than double our throughput, while still keeping the hoof picked quality that makes our cider the best in Equestria!”</p><p class="double">“I’ll say!” called out the pegasus. “This has got to be your best year yet!”</p><p class="double">&quot;I even rigged up an automatic feeder system for the barrels. Just a simple ramp and counterweight driven mechanism, but it does the job. And the best bit is that it&#039;s all <i>way</i> overbuilt, it should run for days without any maintenance other than changing the filters in the washing stage and refilling the barrel magazine.” There was a clunk as another barrel entered the mechanism. “All wood construction too, apart from the hardware, so it was cheap to build too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack couldn’t help smirk slightly at the crestfallen faces of the two hornswagglers. “I’ll tell you what; you can buy a bunch of apples at wholesale rates. Even with our new system, we won’t have much left to export. You might find a market for what that gadget makes in Trottingham or Hoofington. We’ll even knock off five points if you credit the apples as coming from Sweet Apple Acres. Of course, that’s on top of what you owe us for the fence post…”</p><p class="double">Flim fidgeted under Applejack&#039;s gaze.</p><p class="double">“Ah, about that, we&#039;re sort of, low on funds just at the moment.”</p><p class="double">“So, you&#039;re broke.” The farm-pony gave a sigh. “Figures!”</p><p class="double">Flam replied, “We have plenty of assets, it&#039;s just they&#039;re all tied up in the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000…”</p><p class="double">“Like I said, broke.” Applejack replied, giving them both a look. “Well, you can always work it off in kind. Since we know your names, I guess you should know ours. I&#039;m Applejack, and this&#039;s my little sis Applebloom. Over there you&#039;ve got my brother Big Macintosh, and Granny Smith.”</p><p class="double">Truth be told, she had very little time for these two swindlers. They&#039;d tried to steal the farm out from under her family, though the Apples hadn&#039;t exactly made it hard for them. However, only she and Applebloom knew that, as neither Big Mac nor Granny were loopers. Still, it went against her nature to just kick these guys out in the cold, as they hadn&#039;t actually done anything this time.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d let them earn the price of the fence post and their stake in apples, but she did intend to work them hard. Maybe she could teach them the value of an honest day&#039;s work, rather than a get rich quick scheme.</p><p class="double">Applebloom was still examining the device with an appraising eye. She still dimly remembered that she&#039;d been excited by the machine, and ready to use it, until the Flim Flam Brothers had suggested their yellow dog terms. Even in the original time-line, it had lead to her learning more about mechanics and the idea to design a float for the Summer Harvest Festival.</p><p class="double">In a way, it had ultimately led to her finding her cutie-mark, a couple of dozen loops later. The problem had been, her talent wasn&#039;t just fixing stuff, though that had been a part of it, but inventing new devices and new machines, especially electronics. It had taken a fused loop, that first one where she&#039;d subbed for a fox called Miles &#039;Tails&#039; Prower, to show her where her skills really lay. (And annoyingly, it was never the same thing to get her mark two loops in a row…)</p><p class="double">A lot of the technologies she was best at hadn&#039;t yet been invented in base-line Equestria. Her cutie-mark expressed itself as a number of different things, depending on the circumstances, spanners and apple carts had frequently figured, but whenever she went really deep into computers and electronics she got a rainbow striped apple with a bite out of it. She guessed it represented a zap apple, since they involved electricity and innovating new techniques to turn them into an amazing jam.</p><p class="double">Still, this machine had been the first thing to turn her thoughts to creating rather than fixing up, so maybe she owed them at least something. Besides, she could use their knowledge. “Y&#039;know, it isn&#039;t a bad design. Over-complicated, but the ideas are actually pretty sound. It looks to me like you got interested in adding all kinds of bells and whistles rather than making the basic systems reliable.”</p><p class="double">She couldn&#039;t actually blame them for that; it wasn&#039;t as if she hadn&#039;t suffered from that herself on occasion, especially when she was trying to tech up to building her own Maritech. Some of her more enthusiastic experiments had ended in malfunctions that involved terms like &#039;blast radius&#039;, and in a couple of particularly bad cases, &#039;funeral&#039;. At least it had been her own. Even with every-pony being resurrected at the start of a loop, killing one of her friends would have been something she&#039;d not have wanted to cope with.</p><p class="double">“I wouldn&#039;t have thought an earth-pony filly would know much about magical engineering,” Flam said carefully, clearly aware that Big Macintosh was watching them both with a stern expression.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;d be surprised. Maybe I could help out, in return for some help myself. When I want to get some magical elements into my designs, I have to get in Twilight Sparkle or my filly friend Sweetie Belle to help out. But Twilight Sparkle&#039;s more of a straight up artificer, she makes purely magical items, and Sweetie Belle&#039;s talent is more to do with singing, and using her magic to enhance it, or vice versa.” Applebloom shrugged. “Besides, Sweetie doesn’t have much in the way of actual magical power to access yet.”</p><p class="double">“They can both do it, but I feel bad about getting them to help me out for nothing. I figured if I could find a way to substitute my earth pony magic for unicorn magic in the rune sets, I could do the whole thing myself. Since you&#039;re the only two ponies I&#039;ve seen apart from me who mix unicorn magic with machinery, I thought you might be able to help me figure it out. In return, maybe I can help you iron the bugs out of your doodad so it&#039;s actually a product you can sell, rather than a garage queen.”</p><p class="double">Flim, seeing a chance to ingratiate himself, and avoid more arduous farm work immediately said, “Why sure, little lady!”</p><p class="double">Then he back pedalled, seeing the obvious flaw. “But we can&#039;t promise anything, earth pony magic can&#039;t be projected the way unicorn magic can.”</p><p class="double">“That ain&#039;t exactly true.” Applebloom grinned, and picked up an almost empty mug of cider. She passed a hoof over it and the mug was full again. That had the two unicorns buggy eyed.</p><p class="double">“Zebra use similar magic to earth ponies, but they&#039;ve learned to project it. I learned potion-making, off of a zebra named Zecora, who lives in the Everfree forest, which often involves investing a brew with your own magic. I even managed to learn a couple of other tricks, like multiplying the dregs of a liquid to refill a cup. A simple application of the law of homeopathy.” Sure, it took a <i>hay</i> of a lot of magic – far more than you could make back from the potion – but it was a neat party piece to pull off once or twice.</p><p class="double">She sighed. “But investing magic into rune sets etched into metal requires different techniques to investing it into a magically active organic base. My martial arts training helped too, but I still can&#039;t quite get it.” She didn&#039;t say that it hadn&#039;t been her training under Temple Fortress, but under Master Roshi that had really buffed her earth magic manipulation.</p><p class="double">From what Goku had said, the original Bulma hadn&#039;t been in the least interested in martial arts, though she was a genius engineer, but at least some of Applebloom&#039;s earth pony nature had carried over into her human body, and she&#039;d been able to take the Turtle School training regime. She&#039;d never be a Tenka&#039;ichi Budo&#039;kai Winner, but an also-ran by Dragonball world standards was still a serious martial artist by almost any other universes standards. Except Nerima, but then that was a special case.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t get too comfy with those two, little sis. I aim to make them do some heavy work to pay for their apples. You can have them when I&#039;m finished with them.” Applejack motioned with her head in the direction of the rise that held the Crusader&#039;s tree-house. “Have them park that contraption at your workshop and bring them back down. We&#039;ve still got a passel of work to do before the sun sets.”</p><p class="double">“We haven&#039;t…” Flam started to say, but Flim put a hoof over his mouth. “You&#039;ll provide food and a place to sleep too?”</p><p class="double">“I reckon we can manage something.” Applejack replied, tersely.</p><p class="double">“C&#039;mon!” Applebloom waved at the two of them, and stepped through the gates to Sweet Apple Acres. “And be careful with that thing, you don&#039;t want to knock anything else down.”</p><p class="double">She walked on ahead, leading them along the path through the orchards, and listened closely. The two of them were talking, and probably thought their low voices were drowned out by the background noise of their machine, but Applebloom had a lot of experience picking out voices from over the roar of machinery.</p><p class="double">“Brother, why were you so eager to accept their offer?” Flam was asking. “Sure that filly did a party trick, but we could just try the next town over and see if we could scare up some business there. I didn&#039;t like the gleam in that Applejack mare&#039;s eyes when she talked about putting us to work.”</p><p class="double">Flim gave a little smirk. “Brother, you&#039;re missing the point. What we have here is opportunity. At the very least we can get a meal and a bed for the night. Who knows what else a couple of well groomed and devilishly handsome stallions might be able to accomplish? At least that filly up front isn&#039;t as hostile as the rest of her family. I&#039;m sure we can charm her into putting in a good word for us with her sister.”</p><p class="double">The moustachioed stallion gave a huff. “If we can convince her that we&#039;ve actually helped her. She&#039;s probably read a couple of books and is just playing at inventing. Or do you think she can actually help fix the 6000?”</p><p class="double">“Who cares? We play along. Hopefully she&#039;ll have some basic tools, and maybe even parts we can use. We should be able to convince her to provide parts to show off our artificing skills on. It&#039;s better than nothing, at least.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom gave a little chuckle. This was going to be<i> fun</i>. She stopped at the foot of the hill that the Crusader&#039;s tree-house sat on. It was built up with a main house, a lookout post surmounted by a telescope poking from the top, and a couple of small air-boat hulls and other platforms sticking out from the upper branches. A broad grassy path lined by apple trees on both sides, led up the side of the hill but stopped well short of the tree-house itself.</p><p class="double">“Okay, park it here,” Applebloom called out. “I have to open up the workshop.”</p><p class="double">She scampered up the hill, and disappeared into a small shack at the base of the tree-house.</p><p class="double">Flam rolled his eyes. “That&#039;s her workshop? It&#039;s barely big enough to fit a wagon, let alone this.”</p><p class="double">There was a crunch, and a rumbling sound. A line appeared in the grass in front of them, and the lines of trees running up either side of the wide path tilted outwards as the &#039;path&#039; split to open upwards into a pair of massive doors, running the entire length of the hillside. The opening was wide enough to fit a dirigible, let alone the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.</p><p class="double">A paved road with dotted lines of lights running along each side ran into the hill. As they watched, blowers started up in the grates that ran along the centre line, clearing away the dirt that had fallen from the crack between the doors.</p><p class="double">“Okay, bring it in!” Applebloom&#039;s voice came from nowhere, or rather, they guessed concealed speakers. They followed the instructions, filled with equal parts trepidation and curiosity. Both were well rewarded. As soon as they were in, the doors started to close over them, sealing down to a shallowly angled ceiling, lit from underneath by the runway lights.</p><p class="double">The space at the end of the runway clearly took up most of the interior of the hill. A massive main hangar, at least twenty pony-lengths high and over a hundred each way dominated, but along each side were smaller bays containing still massive machines. An open frame lift at one end clearly rose up to the &#039;shack&#039; by the tree-house, and the entire place was lit by banks of electric lights of a power and density they&#039;d only seen in Manehattan. The smell of metal and lightning hung in the air.</p><p class="double">Applebloom was enjoying the expressions of shock on the two pony inventors faces. A Maritech fighter was parked up alongside a humanoid robot that stood over halfway to the ceiling, painted in yellow with crimson trim, her Apple Labour. Several smaller suits of armour stood on pedestals, and various other vehicles and devices such as a sizeable Extreme Gear board were neatly arrayed along the walls.</p><p class="double">She trotted over. “I&#039;m sure we can find some basic tools in here somewhere. I even have a couple of books, though most of them are on my computer system.”</p><p class="double">Back when she was starting out, it had generally taken months to build even a basic workshop, and it had been frustrating to have to start over each loop, even when she&#039;d managed to get Twilight Sparkle to store some of the key equipment she needed in her stuff-space pocket. But that was before she&#039;d been through the world of the dragon balls.</p><p class="double">While capsules should have been the answer, they&#039;d proved to be awkward to store in her sub-space pocket. The two incompatible spaces had interfered with each other and tended to dump out whatever she was storing at random times. She’d invented a shrinking watch which miniaturised things in real space, but that had proved to awkward to produce for pieces of kit much beyond the size of a human.</p><p class="double">Ultimately it had been the martial arts training that she&#039;d undergone that had pumped up her energy reserves and ability to manipulate earth magic. It had also fed into her being able to maintain a much bigger volume of stuff space. Now she could pack everything she needed, all her heavy production machinery and equipment, into her own stuff-space pocket. Setting up the workshop was just a matter of days, hours if she got Applejack to pitch in.</p><p class="double">“This is…” Flim was flabbergasted, and Flam was flummoxed.</p><p class="double">“Oh, this is nothing,” Applebloom said. “You should see the Geofront Twilight Sparkle built under Golden Oaks Library, well under all of Ponyville. It&#039;s a couple of miles across, has its own eco-system even. It&#039;s designed to store the whole of Ponyville in case of an emergency, but she mainly uses it for her artificing. She drives her mage furnace off a magma core-tap, it makes this place look like a rabbit hole.”</p><p class="double">Admittedly, Twilight only built the danged thing once every few dozen times Applebloom met her – too much effort otherwise – but it was there this time, so it was a valid point to raise.</p><p class="double">She waved to an empty section of wall. “You can park up there. It&#039;s handy for the photo-etching process line. I figured one way to reduce your maintenance is to replace those magical valves with one hundred nano-meter integrated rune-sets. Completely solid state, using a magically active mithril/orichalcum layer on a cold iron substrate. I can probably shrink the entire quality control module on your gadget down to a square about the size of a single bit piece.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s impossible! No-one can etch magical symbols that finely!” Flam flustered. “A unicorn horn is only so sharp.”</p><p class="double">“Photo-etching, I said. I use a resist dye made from black hellbore, a common base for potions. It&#039;s magically active and leaves a magical trace on the runic pattern, which is raised rather than engraved. All a unicorn horn has to do is spray it with magic, and the runic pattern is charged up. No need to etch each symbol with your horn while investing magic into it.” It occurred to Applebloom, perhaps a bit late, that she was probably overdoing it on the advanced terminology… ah well, they’d learn.</p><p class="double">She chivvied them towards the lift. “Now come on, my big sis doesn&#039;t like to be kept waiting.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">13.6</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia felt herself tense up involuntarily. While the preparations for the Summer Sun festival seemed complete, at least those which Twilight had overseen… there was also the matter of Nightmare Moon’s imminent return.</p><p class="double">If her crazy plan had worked, then – just maybe – she could see her sister safe once more. But… if not, then all she had worked for in the last thousand years would be erased.</p><p class="double"><i>Time.</i></p><p class="double">She walked out onto the small stage in Ponyville town hall.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">About halfway through the preparatory speech, she saw something out of the corner of her eye and stopped in confusion. Her audience rustled, wondering why she’d stopped, then turned to look at the same thing she was.</p><p class="double">A mug with steam wafting off of it, hovering in the air.</p><p class="double">Then… Celestia’s knees went weak with shock. Luna followed the cup, which was clearly held in her magic, blinking sleepily and wearing a dressing gown.</p><p class="double">“Celly? Sorry to interrupt…” Luna lowered the mug slightly, and Celestia caught sight of plain milk in there, “But I can’t find where you keep the cocoa. Did you rearrange the kitchen?”</p><p class="double">“…what?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I was getting ready for bed,” Luna said, breaking off in a jaw-cracking yawn, “anyway, I was getting ready, and I was going to have a cup of cocoa and some biscuits before I turned in. But I couldn’t find the cocoa, and I’ve already heated the milk so I thought I’d ask.”</p><p class="double">Luna raised something to her mouth, and ate it. There was a crunching sound. The next words she spoke were slightly muffled. “Excellent biscuits, though. I approve of the chocolate shards baked into them.”</p><p class="double">“…Luna?” Celestia tried to get over her shock. “Er… second cupboard from the left, behind the sugar.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks. Sorry for the interruption.” Luna vanished in a flash of dark.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">13.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia massaged her temples. “I’m sure I must be imagining it…”</p><p class="double">“What is it, dear sister?” Luna asked, finishing off her evening breakfast.</p><p class="double">“Earlier today I went for a walk in the gardens,” Celestia explained. “And I could have sworn blind that Discord’s stone prison had moved.”</p><p class="double">“Surely not!” Luna said, shocked. “He has escaped?”</p><p class="double">“No, no, his statue’s still on the pedestal, it was just… differently posed.” Celestia shook her head. “Or that’s what it looked like. Maybe I’m just tired.”</p><p class="double">Her sister put a hoof on her foreleg. “Go to sleep, Celestia. I should be handling more of your workload than I am, anyway.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next morning, Celestia flash-heated some toast (a bit extravagant, but she was feeling chipper after her extra sleep) and passed Luna making herself dinner.</p><p class="double">The lunar alicorn pointed at her. “I think that you might be right, sister.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Celestia asked, a butter-loaded knife paused mid-spread.</p><p class="double">“He’s sticking his tongue out.” Luna said, pointing towards the gardens.</p><p class="double">The elder alicorn forewent jam and hurried out into the grounds, eating her toast on the move.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Is it the stress, Luna?” Celestia asked, shaking her head. “Are we <i>both</i> losing it?”</p><p class="double">“I do not know.” Luna frowned. “What did he look like this time?”</p><p class="double">“Jazzhands.” At Luna’s look of confusion, Celestia created an illusion. “There was a minotaur a few decades back who called this pose jazzhands. Not sure why…”</p><p class="double">“No headdress any more?” Luna checked. Celestia nodded in confirmation.</p><p class="double">“Right, there’s only one way to solve this,” the elder sister added. “Luna, I would take it as a favour if you would handle my duties for the day. I am going on stakeout.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia ignored the rain pattering on her wings. There was no <i>way</i> she was going to spend five minutes asking for the weather schedule to be changed, and potentially waste six hours of staring through binoculars.</p><p class="double">Lulled by the whispering of the rain, it took her about three seconds to notice when the statue abruptly disappeared.</p><p class="double">“…wait, what?” she said, lowering the binoculars. “But… all I did was blink…”</p><p class="double">Grey stone caught her eye, and she turned towards it. It was almost a hundred metres from where Discord’s statue had been, and it was…</p><p class="double">…frozen in a running pose.</p><p class="double">Another blink, and it disappeared again. This time, it appeared precariously dangling from the roof.</p><p class="double">Another – and it vanished altogether.</p><p class="double">Celestia swept the gardens, looking for the grey stone of Discord’s statue and backing up in slight fear…</p><p class="double">Then bumped into something. She whirled, seeing the statue only a yard or so away from her.</p><p class="double">Dangling from its hand was a sign that read ‘boo!’</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna galloped onto the colonnade. “What is it, Sister! I heard your scream-”</p><p class="double">“Don’t blink, Luna!” Celestia shouted without turning around. “I think it moves when we blink!”</p><p class="double">“Actually, I don’t <i>need</i> you to blink,” Discord replied conversationally, brushing grey dust off his skin and fur, and tossing the sign into the distance. “It’s just funny.”</p><p class="double">He looked at the two glowing horns pointed right at him. “Oh, what? It’s just a bit of fun!”</p><p class="double">“This is what I think of your joke, Discord,” Celestia countered. “Fire!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Twilight Sparkle,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I am sending you a large fridge containing the draconequus known as Discord. This chaotic entity ruled over Equestria in times long past, but was defeated and sealed by my sister and myself using the Elements of Harmony.</i></p><p class="double"><i>He escaped at some time last week, and attempted to play games with Luna and I. We did not take this well, and as a result he was hit by two very powerful spells – one fire, one ice.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Since I’m sending him to you in a fridge, I’m sure you can work out which order they were in. In any case, he survived, but it is our hope that he will not be ready to attempt his mind games again for some time – at least until the ice thaws.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Please either re-seal him or attempt to rehabilitate him as you did my sister.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Always ready to speak with you,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Celestia.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Twilight heaved the fridge open. “I told you that imitating the Weeping Angels was going too far.”</p><p class="double">Discord declined to comment. Possibly because of the foot-thick coating of ice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">13.8</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia felt the by-now-familiar surge of the world reorganizing itself around her, as she Awoke into a Loop.</p><p class="double">She took a moment to scan her memories. After the Loop where she’d nearly missed an ongoing invasion, it was something she never forgot…</p><p class="double">“Goodness,” she said, blinking. “That’s a long way back…”</p><p class="double">It was, in fact, barely three years after Luna had first transformed into Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">Celestia pondered what to do. She could wait over nine hundred and seventy years for Twilight Sparkle to be born, or…</p><p class="double">“I think ‘or’, this time,” Celestia decided.</p><p class="double">In the first place, she wanted to see what the Griffin lands were like. In the second, she wanted to see if giving Luna her own subjects would help her recover.</p><p class="double">And in the third, there <i>was</i> a bit of the trickster in Celestia. Just a bit.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was woken from a deep, decade-eating slumber by a WHUMP of displaced air.</p><p class="double">Air? On the moon? She quickly drew herself erect, breathing in deeply as she realized that, yes, for whatever reason there was air available.</p><p class="double">Also, there was a fifteen-foot tall slab of bedrock and soil in front of her, stretching at least a mile to the left and right. Flying up, she saw it was just as large in the forwards direction – and it had trees on it. Trees, and flowers, and grass, and…</p><p class="double">For a few minutes, Nightmare Moon looked more like a filly prancing amongst something she’d not thought she could enjoy any more.</p><p class="double">Another <i>WHUMP</i> drew her out of her reverie, this one coming from much further off. The alicorn took flight, circled, and looked out in the direction it had come from.</p><p class="double">This new slab, like the first one, turned out to be dozens of miles on a side. Instead of forest, it held grasslands.</p><p class="double">A third concussive wash of air, followed by an almighty splash. Millions of gallons of sea water appeared in one of her large craters, filling it almost to the brim.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">By the time half an hour had gone, there was enough transplanted land on the moon to equal a small continent, and Moon was utterly baffled.</p><p class="double">Then an earth pony materialized with a <i>pop</i>.</p><p class="double">“…eh?” he said.</p><p class="double">“Why art thou here?” Nightmare Moon asked, flying down in front of him.</p><p class="double">“Mine ruler, Princess Celestia, enquired of me as to whether bananas were the fruit I preferred,” the pony replied, frowning at the alicorn. “Upon my negative answer – since my family are more into the trade of growing apples – she made some bespellment and transplanted me here. Where might here be, if I be so bold as to enquire?”</p><p class="double">“This? This is the moon!” Nightmare gestured around, then blinked. “Though in truth it does not look like it did when We awoke this morn.”</p><p class="double">She frowned. “One supposes that if mine sister’s tyranny hath progressed this far, it behooves Us to offer sanctuary to those others who fall afoul of her ire. Attend me…?”</p><p class="double">“Crab Apple, your highness,” the earth pony supplied. “We had wondered at thy disappearance, Princess Luna…”</p><p class="double">“Crab Apple.” Nightmare nodded. “Come, then, and we shall find you an area of land to till.”</p><p class="double">There were three more pops, and two pegasi and a unicorn materialized.</p><p class="double">“…but I said I <i>did!</i>” one of them protested. “Why ask the question if thou art going to apply the same result in any case?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked. “A moment, stout Crab Apple. It seems We may need to establish an immigration desk.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia let a grin cross her face. At last, she was finished.</p><p class="double">Every single pony in Equestria, and about eighty percent of the land, had been transferred to the moon. The resultant patchwork green-blue-yellow orb overhead looked… different, but interesting – especially as Celestia had tried to arrange the teleported bits to recreate the shape of the Mare in the Moon.</p><p class="double"><i>And Lulu always wanted more ponies to appreciate her. Right, now then, what shall I do?</i></p><p class="double">Celestia realized that she had, for once, managed to escape paperwork.</p><p class="double">“<i>Right.</i> I am going to go try out surfing.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What,” Twilight said, as she finally Awoke into this version of Equestria…’s moon.</p><p class="double">“…huh. That’s actually kind of neat.”</p><p class="double">She was the student of Princess Luna, and currently taking a course at the Lunarium Academy of the Magical Sciences.</p><p class="double">Luna was still a princess, but she wasn’t a <i>ruling</i> one. One hundred years ago, she had handed power over to an assembly of ponies electing their heads of state and of government by popular vote, and now held a purely religious role in this new lunar republic.</p><p class="double">From what Twilight could determine, Luna didn’t actually want that religious role, but when a single pony is a one-horned meteor shield they become a religious figure all over again quite quickly. And there was the occasional little smile on Luna’s face when she rolled her eyes in exasperation that said her annoyance might not be quite full-blooded…</p><p class="double">Of course, she was still on the <i>moon</i>. What had <i>happened?</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">“Thank you, Twilight,” Luna said. “I don’t know why my sister sent every pony in the country to the moon for a thousand years, but if an answer can be found I’m sure you and your team will find it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Good thing we managed to get Shadowbolt support through the senate, so we’re not going to be going in completely alone.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Luna nodded. “Go well, Twilight Sparkle. And your friends.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and her team – her five friends from the original timeline, of course, as well as two Shadowbolts – flashed into existence on the pristine shoreline of Equestria.</p><p class="double">“Okay, everypony,” Twilight said. “Keep an eye out for trouble.”</p><p class="double">“Hello!” a cheery voice said. Twilight turned, and her jaw dropped in disbelief.</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia was riding a huge curler into shore, wings beating to let her keep up an impossible angle on the crest of the wave with her surfboard.</p><p class="double">Dash’s eyes glistened. “Soooo coooool…”</p><p class="double">With a rumbling crash, the wave finally broke, and Celestia rode the swash right up to their hooves.</p><p class="double">“I <i>never</i> get tired of that!” Celestia said, grinning. “Anyway. I assume you’re from my sister?”</p><p class="double">“…yeah,” Twilight managed.</p><p class="double">“Good. Here’s a letter for her.” Celestia passed over an elaborate envelope. “Hold on, the waves are good, I want to keep going while they’re big.”</p><p class="double">Picking up the surfboard, she galloped back out to sea.</p><p class="double">Twilight’s eyes were drawn to a very familiar purple dragon, also on a surfboard.</p><p class="double">“…has she spent the last thousand years just faffing about having a good time?” she asked incredulously. “Well, apart from hatching a baby dragon…”</p><p class="double">Then she noticed the slip of paper hidden underneath the letter. <i>Hey, Twilight, I awoke really early this time!</i></p><p class="double">“Oh. Okay, then,” Twilight shrugged. “Fair enough. Right, I’ll teleport us back.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That’s just not fair,” Luna said, grinning despite her words. “She swindled me <i>into</i> a job.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you managed to give it to us,” Twilight countered. “So you’ve got just as much free time now…”</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>14.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Reconciliation</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I’ve heard you’re having some… problems?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom spun in place, trying to ignore a sinking feeling. She recognized that voice. “Discord!?”</p><p class="double">“Exactomundo.” Discord started playing keep-up with his fang. “One, two, three… anyway, I’m not actually evil any more. For given definitions of ‘not evil’… I’m not sure I’ve got the hand of it, to be honest.”</p><p class="double">Discord broke off his ramble for a moment, caught the fang, and used it to write on a scroll. “Was… honest. Ooh, three more times and I get a free pen!”</p><p class="double">Applebloom blinked. Discord was a bit overwhelming at the best of times…</p><p class="double">“Anyway. Enjoy the trip!”</p><p class="double">He snapped his claws. Applebloom had just the time to frame the question in her mind – <i>what</i> trip? – before the magic triggered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara began to come awake. “Nnngh… can’t be time for school yet…”</p><p class="double">As she stirred, the back of her (still very drowsy) mind began to notice things that didn’t make sense. For one thing, there was sunlight beating down on her. She could feel the heat on her coat, especially on her left side.</p><p class="double">But that didn’t make sense, did it? She’d certainly gone to bed at home…</p><p class="double">And then there was the fact that on her <i>right</i> side, the cooler one, there was something… itchy. </p><p class="double">She shifted position, and something gritty dug into her forelegs.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, she realized what it was.</p><p class="double">“Why is there sand in my bed?” Diamond asked, blinking and getting up. And seeing that, instead of her familiar bedroom, she was on some kind of beach. “Am I dreaming?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” a <i>horribly</i> familiar voice answered from landwards of her. Diamond spun, wobbling slightly, and saw that… as she’d thought… it was Applebloom.</p><p class="double">“Basically,” the other filly continued, “I dunno exactly why or how this happened, but we’re stranded together on a desert island.” Applebloom rolled her eyes. “Go team.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara felt like sneering, but that was quickly subsumed by a rising wave of panic. “Stranded?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, pretty much.” Applebloom pointed further inland. “I kinda woke up first, so ah went t’ the top of the biggest hill ah could find. There ain’t anythin’ else ah can see – no fields, no other land, nothin’. Just sea, and this here island.”</p><p class="double">“Why? What happened? Did you do this?” Diamond felt sick. “I… I… what about school? I’ve <i>never</i> been tardy!”</p><p class="double">“We got bigger things to worry about,” Applebloom pointed out firmly. Diamond resented the tone of voice – and the fact that it made her feel like an idiot – but it let her get a clamp on part of her hysteria. That just made the rest of it come to the fore, though.</p><p class="double">“W… what do we do?” she asked quietly.</p><p class="double">For a moment, Diamond could swear that Applebloom was gauging her with the kind of look that she was more used to getting from miss Cheerilee. Then the moment passed, and there was just the cool appraisal of another filly. Imagination painted a sneer beneath.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Applebloom put aside her assessment of Diamond, and began pacing. “I know a bit about surviving in th’ wilderness – you know, the Everfree-”</p><p class="double">“<i>You</i> have been in the <i>Everfree?</i>” Diamond blurted, unable to stop herself. “How? Wasn’t that unicorn… Twilight something, <i>petrified</i> last month? And if she’s the student of Princess Celestia, how…”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Applebloom’s short statement carried some surprise. “I didn’t know you knew that. About miss Twilight, I mean.”</p><p class="double">“<i>My</i> father keeps me up to date on all the local ponies of importance.” Diamond puffed out her breast. “It’s something I should know, as a pony who’ll be important herself one day.”</p><p class="double">This time, Applebloom looked very sad.</p><p class="double">Diamond shook her head. <i>Can’t be anything important.</i></p><p class="double">“Okay, anyway,” Applebloom resumed, “’cause our farm’s right up next to the Everfree, ah know how to survive in there for a bit just in case ah get lost, or somethin’. But this ain’t exactly the Everfree.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, well spotted,” Diamond rolled <i>her</i> eyes this time. “Sure you don’t have some Buffalo blood in you?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked up for a moment. “…nah, don’t think so. But mah cousin’s kinda interested in a buffalo girl, so might be that ah’ll have one in the ol’ family tree soon enough.”</p><p class="double">“…no, that was a…” Diamond sighed. “Never mind.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, I gotcha.” Applebloom gave a sage nod. “Still, there’s a few things ah <i>do</i> know. Most important things are normally shelter, water an’ food in that order. Here…” she looked up at the sun, burning fiercely with a midday heat which felt <i>wrong</i> to the earth pony filly – seeing as she felt like it was only eight or so in the morning. “Ah think water’s the most important.”</p><p class="double">“Well, go on then.” Diamond waved. “You know this sort of thing, so go find some water.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, about that…” Applebloom rubbed the back of her neck. “If this were the Everfree, ah’d be able to do it easy. But it ain’t. And there’s two of us.”</p><p class="double">“…so?” Those details seemed quite unconnected.</p><p class="double">“Ah just plumb don’t have th’ <i>time</i>.” Applebloom gestured around at the whole island. “In th’ Everfree, ah’d know where to look for water, food, shelter, all that. But here? It might be that th’ water’s halfway across the island. I could <i>probably</i> manage myself, but not both of us.”</p><p class="double">Diamond started to get a sinking feeling.</p><p class="double">“So, we’ve got a problem.” Applebloom nodded to her. “Well, you have the main one. Basically, y’all got a choice. Either we each look for our own needs, or we work together. And ah <i>do</i> mean together.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara knew almost exactly what ‘together’ meant. She’d have to do some of the backbreaking work, as much as this… <i>farmer</i>, who was much better at it anyway even if she didn’t have a cutie mark for it, and even take orders <i>from</i> her.</p><p class="double">“No way am I working with you!” she said, suddenly coming to a decision. “You don’t have a cutie mark for this, so you’ll probably just screw it up!”</p><p class="double">Part of her thought that annoying the pony who was clearly the expert around here was a very bad idea. But it was a small part, and she didn’t really pay any attention.</p><p class="double">“Aright, then.” Applebloom nodded to her, in a very good imitation – good enough that Diamond had to admit she couldn’t find any actual flaws in it – of court style. “Ah’ll go get lookin’ for mah water, then.” And she turned around and trotted off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">14.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>‘Dear Princess Celestia. Since I find it very, very hard to choose between my friends – and I do not think it fair to invite a pony to a ball without also inviting their friends – I will have to decline your invitation and return my gala tickets.’</i></p><p class="double">Twilight finished writing, signed the scroll, and passed it to Spike. “Send it, please.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Spike incinerated the scroll and tickets.</p><p class="double">“But…” Pinkie gazed at where the tickets had been, stretching out a folorn hoof. “Party?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn shrugged. “Look, I’d rather just not go than have us fight over it…”</p><p class="double">Spike gulped. “Uh oh… I don’t feel so good… uh…”</p><p class="double">Green flame erupted, and a wrapped package coalesced to land on the table with an almighty <i>thump.</i></p><p class="double">As an afterthought, a scroll appeared on top of it.</p><p class="double">Twilight picked this one up herself. “Spike… there’s some throat sweets in the bathroom cabinet, third row on the left. I think you need one.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Spike croaked and headed off.</p><p class="double">Twilight scanned the scroll. <i>‘Dear Twilight Sparkle. Sorry, I wasn’t thinking. Here – the Ponyville census data should be up to date, so this should be about the right number. Yours, Princess Celestia.’</i></p><p class="double">She lowered the scroll. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie ripped the paper off the package. “Hey, it’s hundreds of gala tickets!”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. “That must be what she meant by census data. Oh, this will be marvellous!” She took two tickets and headed off to her shop. “I will have <i>so much </i>business!”</p><p class="double">Twilight resolved to try a slightly different way of phrasing things in the future.</p><p class="double">Though this would probably be a lot more enjoyable, actually, if the snobbish attitudes of Canterlot high society were simply buried under the entire population of Ponyville…</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Well, we’ll certainly give you a try-out,” Spitfire said. “I’ve never seen a pony that can do what you can in the air.”</p><p class="double">“Yay!” Dinky cheered, as the Ponyville mailmare accepted an application form that Soarin’ passed her. “Go mum!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Applejack said, hurrying up to the unicorn. “You gotta teleport me home!”</p><p class="double">“Why?” Twilight blinked. “I thought you were doing a roaring trade?”</p><p class="double">“Ah ran out,” Applejack said bluntly. “Now get me to somewhere ah can resupply, afore Carrot Top overtakes me!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Sho, anyway, enough about… about… me!” Berry said, taking another drink of the excellent vintage. “Wha’ about you?”</p><p class="double">Blueblood adjusted his tie nervously, looking for an escape route. There were other ponyville mares eying him from all directions, waiting for their chance.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Okay, the next thing you do is you put your hooves up like this!” Pinkie said, demonstrating.</p><p class="double">Princesses Celestia and Luna tried to copy her, wobbling slightly.</p><p class="double">“Close enough!” Pinkie grinned. “Almost there, just three or four more steps to go, and then we try with the music!”</p><p class="double">“What is this called?” Luna asked, steadying herself with wingbeats.</p><p class="double">“Well, Angel Bunny and I invented it, so I call it the hare hare dance!”</p><p class="double">Dozens of nobles looked on, most of them undergoing partial brain reboots.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Wait,” Sparkler said, casting a spell over herself and Fluttershy. “That should help. It’s what I always use at Winter Wrap-Up when the animals are cranky.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Fluttershy shuffled her hooves. “What does it do?”</p><p class="double">“Basically, it just makes animals calmer. I know it’s what your talent is supposed to do already,” Sparkler shrugged, “But I don’t have it, and any little helps.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Dash helped Cheerilee corral some of the colts and fillies who had started to wander off. “Hey!”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Dash,” Cheerilee said, sighing. “They’re hard enough to handle at the best of times.”</p><p class="double">“You’re telling me!” Dash gasped, having just intercepted the Crusaders about to do what would have started as an attempt to get a high society cutie mark and ended as an international incident. “I’m the fastest pony in Equestria and I can’t keep up! Hey, Featherweight, put down that camera!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Spike cracked his knuckles, and sat on the piano’s stool. “Right. What did you want me to play?”</p><p class="double">Rarity frowned. “Let’s see… what about the Moonlight Sonata?”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Spike ran over the music in his head. “Yeah, I know that one. You go get Cadance, I’ll grab Shining Armor.”</p><p class="double">Neither of them were quite sure why they’d decided to play matchmaker, especially with ponies who’d clearly already fallen for one another. Perhaps it was just an excuse to be out of the – riotous – main room, which had been fairly annexed by the Ponyville contingent.</p><p class="double">Or maybe it was because Rarity wanted an in with the couple to design their wedding outfits, and Spike wanted an excuse to play romantic music in the same room as Rarity.</p><p class="double">Whatever the reason, they were both quite happy with the arrangement.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“That was the most fun I’ve had in a thousand years,” Celestia said quite seriously, as caretakers started to clear away the detritus of the evening. “Can I invite them all again next year?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I doubt any of them will complain,” Twilight mused. “But you might have a mass boycott by the Canterlot nobility.”</p><p class="double">Celestia shrugged. “Bunch of stuck-ups anyway…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">14.1 b</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Reconciliation, part two</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom trotted briskly into the island’s forest, looking around for anything that might be useful.</p><p class="double"><i>And ah </i>had<i> to unpack everythin’ that might be useful into th’ lab again…</i> About all that was left in her subspace pocket – such as it was, and what there was of it – was a ream or so of paper and some pencils, as well as a mobile phone. Which would have been rather more useful if Equestria had cellular phone towers or even satellites.</p><p class="double">She stopped, as something caught her eye. A coconut lying on the ground. Looking up, she saw the tree it had come from.</p><p class="double">A quick, expertly measured buck, and she had a fresh coconut. A minute or so with a convenient stone, and she’d broken into it and drunk some of the ‘milk’ – which was a relief, given the climate.</p><p class="double">She also now had a gourd to carry water, as and when she found it. Pity she didn’t even have any <i>saddlebags</i>.</p><p class="double">“Ah guess that’s another thing t’ work on…” Pushing herself back up, she took the husk of the coconut in her teeth and began carrying it awkwardly with her towards the hill.</p><p class="double">Sure, she could store it in her subspace pocket, but that would get blatantly obvious to Diamond. And… it didn’t seem fair to her, either, to make a big thing about sharing the effort and then use advantages like that.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The first stream she found was ten minutes into the forest, but it was a pitiful and muddy thing. Taking the stop as an opportunity to finish off the coconut milk, Applebloom then crouched down where a tree shaded the water somewhat and decided to test something.</p><p class="double">One of the first things Zecora had taught her was what almost amounted to an earth magic ‘spell’. It simply told the user how pure water was.</p><p class="double">The spell was almost unbelievably primitive in nature, and took quite a lot of effort to do, but it was useful for making sure that the water you were about to use for a potion wasn’t contaminated – or, for that matter, to test if the water you were about to <i>drink</i> was potable.</p><p class="double">As she’d expected, the test came back negative. But it was good to know that she could still pull it off.</p><p class="double">“…kay… what do ah know about geography…” Applebloom studied the island carefully. “Right. Ah reckon that, if it rained, there’d be water… on… oh, ah’m an idiot.”</p><p class="double">Picking up the coconut again, she headed for the beach. If there was a good stream, it would of course flow into the sea… and she could follow it back up, to find where it was easily accessible.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Stupid flies, stupid sand, stupid sun, stupid island…” Diamond Tiara muttered continuously as she trudged through the undergrowth.</p><p class="double">Rivers just… happened, didn’t they? No, that didn’t make sense. She tried to remember what they’d been taught about the founding of Ponyville – why it had been set up near (though not on) a riverbank, and why the river had been dammed a decade or so later.</p><p class="double">“…okay, I need to find a canyon. Stupid trees, stupid…”</p><p class="double">Diamond tripped over a rock, and stumbled. There was a moment of sharp pain, but when she looked it seemed like she hadn’t actually cut herself. It still felt horrible. And she was getting sweaty in this horrible heat, and she was thirsty, and there were <i>still</i> all those insects and…</p><p class="double">She wanted to go home.</p><p class="double">The filly forced herself back upright. There was no way she was letting Applebloom beat <i>her</i> at something!</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Finally.” Applebloom picked up the coconut shell, and filled it from the clear water of the spring she’d just found. That would do for a while, but it would probably be best to pick up another coconut or two – and then get to making some kind of set of saddle-bags to let her go further with a water supply.</p><p class="double"><i>Hmmm… perhaps more coconuts, strung on twine? Ah don’t know how to </i>make<i> twine, o’ course, but… ah, I’ll see if there’s some vines.</i></p><p class="double">Water thus taken care of, the next thing on the list was food. That was easy enough for now – more coconuts, since there were several palm trees along the beach alone. Applebloom had also seen a few grasses and quite a lot of ferns – hardly gourmet, but perfectly edible.</p><p class="double">Shelter. That was the third thing which was important. It could get <i>very</i> cold at night, especially out in the open – sand, in particular, lost heat within minutes. (One Loop, she and Applejack had moved to Appleloosa – the stargazing trips they’d taken were beautiful, but she’d never before known you could be shivering in the <i>desert!</i>)</p><p class="double"><i>How can ah do this… palm fronds, ah guess, for a kickoff. Ah’d try knockin’ down a tree, but that might have to wait until ah have a saw or somethin’ to turn it into planks.</i></p><p class="double">That led to her thinking about an artesian well, because the spring wasn’t exactly strong. Just a trickle, really, into a thankfully large pool.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">As the sun set, Applebloom stood back and looked at her work. She’d only had a few hours to really work on it, but she felt fairly proud of what she’d created.</p><p class="double">It was, fundamentally, a lean-to. Built around the base of one of the largest trees she’d found, dozens of medium-sized branches had been piled on to a frame supported by a couple of forked ones. Using the hairy husks of the coconut to rope bits of it together with fragile ties had brought her some time to work with it, and by the time the ties had parted the accumulated weight was enough to hold the frame fairly stable.</p><p class="double">Finally, she’d piled sand around the outer edge of the shelter, and more of it to make a simple firepit.</p><p class="double"><i>Now, where’s those dry bush bits ah wanted to use with a fire drill…</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">About half a mile away next to the stream she’d found late in the day, cold, hungry and scared, Diamond Tiara cried herself to sleep.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">14.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said. “This should be fun.”</p><p class="double">The other pony in the room nodded. “I’ve got my costume.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight took a stance, all four hooves on the floor. “Ready?”</p><p class="double">“Laughter!” Pinkie said, following the instructions of the strangely knowledgeable purple pony.</p><p class="double">“Honesty.” Applejack was a little less eager, but willing to give this Twilight the benefit of the doubt that she knew what she was doing.</p><p class="double">“Generosity!”</p><p class="double">“Loyalty!”</p><p class="double">“Kindness…”</p><p class="double">“Magic!” Twilight finished, and flared her horn.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon watched, confused and worried, as six beams of light coalesced…</p><p class="double">And out of them came a pink-purple-yellow alicorn decked out in a fuku, who kicked her in the jaw. “In the name of Harmony, you shall not trouble Equestria any more, blaggard!”</p><p class="double">Twilight held in a snigger.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“You’re sure you don’t know what happened?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">“No,” Cadence replied, shrugging. “Poor Shiny was very worried when I collapsed, but it must have just been a faint or something.”</p><p class="double">“Perhaps…” Celestia left, and Cadence could imagine the confused thoughts running through her head.</p><p class="double">Shining entered the room. “I don’t feel comfortable lying to Celestia about something like this.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, Shiny!” Cadence fluttered her eyelashes. “No harm done, right?”</p><p class="double">The stallion frowned, then shrugged. “I suppose.”</p><p class="double">In all honesty, he didn’t know precisely what had happened – or <i>why</i> his girlfriend had suddenly got changed into a short dress and teleported out of the room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“…I suppose the Elements did look a <i>bit</i> like my old foalsitter,” Twilight allowed. “But it could just be that they take the form of someone familiar to me? I mean, she is who I associate with comfort and with harmony – it’s her talent, isn’t it?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, it is. It is…” Celestia finally shrugged. “I suppose they did work – my little sister is back, and that’s what matters here.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Discord appeared in Celestia’s study. “Hey, Celly! Long time no see. Oh, where are the Elements?”</p><p class="double">“That is just the problem!” Celestia shouted, startling Discord. “I have <i>no</i> idea. For some reason, whenever Twilight and her friends do… something, they summon a duplicate copy of my niece who kicks the problem until it is not a problem any more.”</p><p class="double">“They do, huh?” Discord asked. (Hey, he wasn’t going to lose this opportunity to press Celestia for information. Especially when she apparently hadn’t noticed it was him.)</p><p class="double">“Yes! Nightmare Moon comes back – kicked in the face. Dragon causes problems in Ponyville – kicked in the chest. Rampaging hydra? Kicked in all the faces. And then there was the Ursa Minor that got kicked in the fundament.” Celestia sighed. “I don’t know what is going on.”</p><p class="double">Then she blinked. “Wait. Discord?”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, come again!” Discord said, jumping out the window.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“A-ha-ha!” Discord said, holding up a grey Cadence. “I managed to corrupt the pony who was using the Elements of Harmony, and now there’s nothing you pathetic ponies can do to stop me!”</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. “There’s two problems with that. First, that’s my mild mannered foalsitter, not the Elements summon. And my foalsitter’s talent is, well… harmony. As in, getting on well with everyone. Reverse that, and…” </p><p class="double">The grey Cadence kicked Discord in the teeth.</p><p class="double">“Second, we can still perform the summoning.”</p><p class="double">She and her five friends rattled off the names of their Elements, and the by now familiar Cadence-in-a-Fuku appeared in front of them. The other Cadence promptly collapsed.</p><p class="double">“Er…” Discord mumbled around the hand massaging his injured jaw. “This isn’t going to go well for me, is it?”</p><p class="double">“Nope!” Twilight replied cheerfully.</p><p class="double">Admittedly, making a magical double of Cadence with the mirror pool could have gone <i>very</i> wrong, but it did let her be in two places at once as and when they needed her to be.</p><p class="double">And, as fuku-Cadence kicked Discord in both knees and followed up with a roundhouse kick, Twilight could just about spot Celestia on a balcony in the distance. And judging by her movements, probably tearing up her latest theory and stamping on the bits of paper.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">14.1 c</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Reconciliation, part three</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Applebloom whistled to herself as she finished making a hole in a piece of good stone. With the branch she’d prepared for it, it would be a passable hammer…</p><p class="double">“Applebloom,” she heard a familiar voice croak.</p><p class="double">“What is it?” she asked, turning around. “Ouch. You’re a sight.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara’s mane was unkempt and ragged at the ends, where it hadn’t held up to the night on hard ground well. There were runnels of salt down her muzzle where she’d clearly been crying. Her coat seemed matted with sweat, her colour was quite unhealthy, and she was actually trembling slightly just standing there.</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Diamond said, not even reacting to Applebloom’s comment much. “I… I…” She seemed to be struggling with something. “…help? Please?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom blinked, surprised. Then chastised herself for that response. <i>She ain’t a monster, and ah should remember that.</i> “Sure. I guess this means we’re working together now?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Diamond Tiara nodded jerkily. “I don’t know <i>anything</i> about this. I just… I want to go home.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded. “Okay. Come with me, ah’ll show y’ how to find stuff. You’ll have to pick your own up, but ah’ll tell y’ what to do.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Right,” Applebloom said, about an hour later, to a much recovered Diamond.</p><p class="double">By kicking up water from the pool she’d found yesterday, she’d managed to give Diamond a cold shower (since having her bathe in the pool might have left it too dirty for drinking) and that followed by drying in the sun had had a considerable effect on the earth pony filly.</p><p class="double">“Now, one of th’ most useful things is these here palm trees. Y’ll have had coconut at those fancy dinners o’ yours?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I have.” Diamond looked up at the tree. “But where’s the coconut? Isn’t it supposed to be white?”</p><p class="double">“Only on th’ inside,” Applebloom replied. “And it ain’t shaved, either. But the real important stuff is actually th’ milk. Okay, watch me first.” Backing up carefully to the tree, she kicked out at it and knocked one coconut loose. This one she let fall, and it bounced to the floor without breaking (as it was supposed to).</p><p class="double">She scooped it up. “Okay. Think y’ can do that?”</p><p class="double">“…what, kick a tree? But…” Diamond seemed lost. “…don’t you have to be very strong to do that?”</p><p class="double">“T’ do it for a living, yeah.” Applebloom nodded readily. “Mah sister and brother are two o’ the strongest ponies in Ponyville for that reason. But any earth pony – hay, any pony at all – can buck once or twice. Come on, ah’ll spot y’all.”</p><p class="double">Seeing Diamond’s reluctance, she sweetened the deal. “Since you’re new, and all, you get this one as well if you knock one down. It’s only fair – you ain’t trained for this.”</p><p class="double">The shock on Diamond’s face was followed by a flash of genuine gratitude, before it was replaced in turn by suspicion. “Is there something wrong with that one?”</p><p class="double">“What? No!” Applebloom shook her head vigorously. “Hay, if you’re worried about that ah’ll let y’ have one of the ones in th’ stores back at th’ shelter instead.”</p><p class="double">“No, I…” Diamond struggled again. “…sorry. I… Father made sure I was familiar with business practices, and… you just don’t get gifts, there.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded. “Ah get what y’ mean. Guess they just ain’t used to bein’ honest.”</p><p class="double">“Suppose.” For a moment, there was an actual smile. But then Diamond seemed to realize it was there, and crush it down again.</p><p class="double">It was a start, anyway.</p><p class="double">“Right, so first ah’ll have y’ do it slowly, so y’ know what you’re supposed to do.” Applebloom reached out and supported Diamond’s midriff.</p><p class="double">“Hey! Get off!”</p><p class="double">“If y’ do it slowly, you’ll just fall over unless ah spot you.” Applebloom replied, using the same tone she remembered Applejack teaching <i>her</i> with. It seemed to help, as Diamond just tried kicking out instead.</p><p class="double">“Right, that’s actually pretty good.” Applebloom pushed Diamond’s knees down slightly and raised the angle of her hooves. “That lets you kick the hardest. Martial arts, actually…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Not again!” Diamond said, scowling. Despite six or seven blows to the palm tree, it remained resolutely unbucked.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Applebloom said, frowning herself. “Your technique is fine now. Ah know what it must be – you’re just not hitting hard enough.”</p><p class="double">“This is as hard as I can <i>do!</i>” Diamond whined.</p><p class="double">“No, it ain’t,” Applebloom denied. “It’s just as hard as y’all think y’ can do. Now, ah want you to know how ah used to help mahself learn. Ah pictured th’ tree as the thing ah felt th’ most angry about, and ah bucked it as hard as ah possibly could, and that made me kick it harder. And th’ thing is, it actually made me feel better about what ah was angry about. What is it that makes y’all angry?”</p><p class="double">Seeing Diamond blush slightly, and deciding to not ask for now, Applebloom shook her head. “Never mind. Just imagine that palm tree is the thing that makes you angry. And you’re gonna buck it so hard you’ll send it flyin!”</p><p class="double">“…aaaaAAAARGH!” Diamond let out a scream of rage, and kicked the palm tree with all her might. The force of the blow sent her mane flying in all directions, finishing the work of unravelling her original delicate hairdo, and drove her forwards as the tree bounced back. She tumbled forward in a complete somersault, landed sprawled on her back, and panted with the effort.</p><p class="double">Applebloom whistled, walked out of her sight-line for a moment, and then came back with <i>four</i> coconuts.</p><p class="double">“Well, if you ain’t a natural at this!” she said, grinning. “Ah said ah’d give y’all one for the one y’ knocked down, and so here y’ go. You got two, so here’s two more.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara blinked. “I… did two?”</p><p class="double">“You sure did. Nice work, pardner!”</p><p class="double">Diamond matched the grin. “Maybe that’s why you don’t have a cutie mark for it, then, if a posh filly’s better at it!”</p><p class="double">She froze, mortified. That had just… slipped out.</p><p class="double">But Applebloom only laughed. “Good one. Ah admit, y’all have a point… anyway, here’s the important bit. ‘cause of that bright sun, y’all are sweatin’ a lot. That’s kinda salty, so y’ need t’ get the salt back. Now, the milk in a coconut ain’t actually milk, but it’s got a lot of those salts…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Good,” Applebloom said, as Diamond dragged another branch into the area around the (now expanded) shelter. “That should do us for firewood for th’ evening.”</p><p class="double">Taking two of the sharpest-tipped branches, she speared some coconut meat on each one and passed one to Diamond. “Here y’ go. Don’t worry, ah’ll handle dinner. Y’all have earned it.”</p><p class="double">The pink filly accepted the speared coconut, and felt tears prickle in her eyes. “…<i>thank</i> you. I’m so…”</p><p class="double">“Nah, like ah say, y’ earned it,” Applebloom said, trotting off. “Now, where did ah see that Taro…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">14.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Shining Armor woke up.</p><p class="double">Blinking, he realized just where he was. It was… his room, back at Mom and Dad’s house. But it looked… old.</p><p class="double">Like it used to when he was… <i>oh.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Twily told me about these,</i> Shining thought to himself as he got up. A quick check revealed that he did indeed have his cutie mark – and there were cards on the bookshelf congratulating that fact. It must be the morning after his cute-ceneara.</p><p class="double"><i>I think that makes Twily about… four? Three? Something like that.</i></p><p class="double">That meant he hadn’t met Cadence yet. Pity, really.</p><p class="double"><i>Actually</i>, it meant Cadence was still a pegasus. Which really sucked, because that meant he couldn’t meet her again until after she’d ascended – throwing off those delicate circumstances would be a <i>bad</i> idea.</p><p class="double"><i>Right, what was I supposed to be doing…</i> he dug through his old memories. <i>Right. School.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Well done, Shining!” the teacher said, reading over the essay. “Though I’m surprised you gave me five pages – I only set half a page.”</p><p class="double">“…oh, sorry,” Shining rubbed the back of his neck apologetically. “I guess… yeah, I was just really interested.”</p><p class="double">Actually, he was having trouble adjusting to being a colt again. Twilight might think she was the most academically inclined of the family, and that was for the most part true… but writing? Shining wrestled Guard paperwork every loop. Compared to that, essays were nothing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight grinned, shaking her head. “Shining… I can’t believe you accidentally used a spellform that hasn’t been invented yet.”</p><p class="double">“Look, I said I hadn’t had a loop like this before!” The colt pointed at his little sister, now about seven. “And you’re one to talk! Literally. You’ve been this articulate since we looped in, and that was ridiculous for <i>four</i>.”</p><p class="double">“I’m a prodigy, Shiny.” Twilight shrugged. “Even more now, I suppose… I think Celestia’s already noticed me. Hey, when’s the graduation party for your school?”</p><p class="double">“Uhh… three weeks. I’m probably going to be top of the class,” Shining said, grinning uneasily.</p><p class="double">“I’d be disappointed if you weren’t, it’s only junior high,” Twilight rejoined. “Anyway, here’s an early present for you. It arrived yesterday.”</p><p class="double">She plucked a letter out of her schoolwork and passed it over. Shining took it, opened it, and then just stared.</p><p class="double">He could just about hear Twilight saying something through the rushing sensation that made him feel weak-kneed with relief, but he didn’t care what it was. The letter was the only important thing, right then.</p><p class="double"><i>Next year, love. Next year.</i></p><p class="double"><i>-Cadence.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Right, you ‘orrible lot!” Drill Sergeant Emery Paper shouted. “I don’t want any of you wannabe Private Pansies who can’t handle the pace! Thirty times around the ground at a gallop, and that’s <i>on</i> the ground for you pegasi! Move!”</p><p class="double">Shining fell into a comfortable rhythm fairly quickly. He’d kept up his own personal regimen since he’d first turned up this Loop, out of sheer habit, and it had paid dividends – he was <i>very</i> fit. As might be expected for a young stallion who’d trained daily since he was ten.</p><p class="double">Actually, he finished first. Well ahead of all the other unicorns, and beating out an earth pony called Steel Resolve by about two seconds.</p><p class="double">“Well, well…” Emery came over and looked him up and down. Taking in, in particular, the fact that Shining quickly recovered from the exertion. “Looks like you ain’t just a smart-arse, cadet Armor. Does your ladyfriend like that stamina of yours?”</p><p class="double">Shining nodded. “Yes, sir! Makes it easier for me to keep up when she goes flying, sir!”</p><p class="double">Emery blinked, thrown off slightly. But he recovered quickly enough that only Shining’s veteran eye noticed. “Glad to hear it! Now, the rest of you get the message?”</p><p class="double">One pegasus staggered as he reached the finish, nearly collapsing from the sustained exertion of the sprint.</p><p class="double">Emery shook his head theatrically. “Clearly not! Cadet Armor’s lady friend doesn’t seem to have trouble managing something you lot clearly can’t keep up with!”</p><p class="double">Shining felt dozens of death glares on him. Well, looked like he was the designated target for <i>this</i> round of Basic…</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“What’s that you’re working on, lieutenant?”</p><p class="double">Shining turned, seeing that the speaker was a major, and saluted. “Sir!”</p><p class="double">“At ease.” Major Jump – High Jump, son of High Class – looked over the spell formulae scattered across Shining’s table. “This looks very complex, lieutenant. I can’t quite follow it myself. What’s the intent?”</p><p class="double">“Right. This here is the intent formulation – basically, it defines the target of the warding. And this one defines the sink end of the equation.” Shining tapped the paper, pointing out buffers and flow directors and overflow systems. “More or less, it allows for a protective spell to be cast over a principal that deflects the effects of hostile magic spells – there’s the intent filter, see – into an inanimate sink which takes the damage.”</p><p class="double">The younger unicorn shrugged. “It’s still not very good, since it can’t take more damage than the sink can absorb before failing and it doesn’t last more than an hour or so, and it takes a prepared sink…”</p><p class="double">“This isn’t good?” Major Jump shouted, banging the table and making Shining jump. “Lieutenant, if this spell is overloaded then the pony it protects would have been severely wounded or outright killed anyway by the attack it deflects! What’s the problem?”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Shining trailed off, embarrassed. “The spell formula takes up eight pages of dense script. The only ponies I know of who can actually <i>cast</i> the damned thing are my sister and I.”</p><p class="double">“Sister?” Jump frowned. “Oh, I know the one. Twilight Sparkle, right? That filly who’s revolutionizing the academy. Yes, if it takes that kind of ability to pull off I can see why it would be a problem. You’re trying to simplify it down, then?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, sir.” Shining nodded smartly.</p><p class="double">“Good stallion. Keep at it. And I’ll expect to see you and your girlfriend at the party my wife’s setting up next week, as well – I’ll want an update.” Jump tapped his forehead and trotted off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“I forgot how much effort this whole thing was,” Shining said, shaking his head. He’d just received the information that he was to be promoted to captain – and even with all his foreknowledge, he’d only shaved about a year off the total time. </p><p class="double">Cadence shrugged. She’d avoided ascending this time, claiming that it would be ‘interesting’ to stay as a pegasus for once. “Well, you were very good the first time around, dear.”</p><p class="double">“Suppose. Oh, Twilight reminded me that Nightmare Moon’s return is scheduled for next week. What do you say we go and watch?”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good to me,” Cadence said. “What’s she planning this time?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, she wanted my help. I wonder why…” Shining trailed off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Cadence said, “This is just cruel.” She was giggling, though – the sight before them was just too funny.</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “I’m thinking of making an artefact that casts this spell when triggered, actually. You up for that, Shining?”</p><p class="double">Shining nodded. “Why not.”</p><p class="double">In front of them, Nightmare Moon tried desperately to retain either dignity or threat level. It was difficult, because she was trapped inside a giant pink shield that rolled around like a hamster ball.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">14.1d</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Reconciliation, part four</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Diamond,” Applebloom said sharply, “Ah think it’d be best if you saw this.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara hurried over. The week or so they’d spent on the island had been wearying for her, but she’d gained no lack of respect for Applebloom’s practical skills. Anything which worried her was probably cause for alarm.</p><p class="double">“What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well, ah don’t have a weather forecastin’ cutie mark,” Applebloom said, deadpan, and Diamond held back a giggle, “but that don’t look good.” The engineer and Looper nodded to the east, where clouds were gathering on the horizon.</p><p class="double">“So? It’s just a storm, right?” Diamond asked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, it’s a storm,” Applebloom agreed readily. “And no, it ain’t <i>just</i> a storm. They ain’t scheduled out here, there ain’t a team of pegasi watchin’ it to make sure it’s safe, and we ain’t got much of a shelter against that kinda winds.”</p><p class="double">“…oh. Sorry,” Diamond said. “I just… yeah, you know.”</p><p class="double">“No sweat.” Applebloom thought for a moment. “Ah think it might be a good idea for us to look for a cave, or somethin’. Either that or a big ol’ tree which is good and sturdy.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” The pink filly nodded. “I’ll look on the north side, you take the south.”</p><p class="double">“Fine by me.” Applebloom paused. “You know how to check if a tree’s after bein’ sturdy?”</p><p class="double">“No…” Diamond said, drawing the word out. “But I <i>do </i>recognize what a cave looks like, and what a tree looks like. And – gosh! – I can even recognize the difference between a big tree and a small one. So I’ll find the ones for you to check.”</p><p class="double">This time, it was Applebloom who chuckled. “Alright, you got me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Applebloom said, looking the large fallen Monkeypod tree. It still had earth on the exposed roots and hadn’t rotted away at all, so presumably it hadn’t fallen too long ago. “Yeah, this might actually be better than an intact one.”</p><p class="double">“Good.” Diamond’s voice had nothing but relief. “I thought it might be, but I didn’t know if that was a good idea, and…”</p><p class="double">“Well, you’re right.” Applebloom started looking around. “If we use some big logs, or maybe fell another tree so the canopy is a kinda umbrella…” she paused. “Tell you what. Can you go get some more coconuts, and make sure all the ones we got which we use for water are full, and bring ‘em up here? Except two. Leave them by th’ firepit, because ah think it might be a good idea fer us to get ourselves around a hot meal before the storm comes.”</p><p class="double">“That sounds like a good idea.” Diamond waited for a moment, then set off.</p><p class="double">“Well, ah knew she <i>could</i> rise to it, but ah’m still surprised she <i>did</i>,” Applebloom said to herself. “And ah shouldn’t be.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom had been careful to keep in mind what her unexpected companion could and could not do so far, and never set her a challenge she couldn’t do. Granted, a couple of times at least she’d <i>thought</i> she couldn’t do something, but after enough prodding she gave it a try – and promptly proved herself wrong.</p><p class="double">Watching her, the farmpony-in-training had been struck by a realization.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara, loud-mouthed spoiled bully that she was, wasn’t actually very self confident. Oh, she <i>seemed </i>it, and probably even <i>felt </i>like it, but her obvious surprise at being able to do the tasks Applebloom set her told its own story.</p><p class="double">And she’d been <i>so</i> proud of anything she and ‘bloom had built together, it was almost heartbreaking.</p><p class="double"><i>Guess that comes of having everything done for you… you start to think you can’t do it yourself…</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom had been analyzing the trees while she thought. Selecting a breadfruit tree, she gave it an almighty buck – which sent it crashing down, the bulk of the foliage on top of the fallen trunk but with a substantial amount over the area she’d selected to be their ‘cave’. A second, this one some kind of ash, finished the job.</p><p class="double">“It ain’t perfect, but it’ll do,” she said with satisfaction. “Now, ah’d better get some vine, too, for ropes to tie the branches together…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara huddled next to a pony that, only a little more than a week ago, she wouldn’t have been seen dead with.</p><p class="double"><i>That might still be an option</i>, she thought. <i>No. Shut up.</i></p><p class="double">“Hey, Applebloom?” she asked, shakily. “You heard how the wind’s always the best part, right?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom chuckled. “Yep. And ah heard when you said the waitin’ was the best part, and ah bet in ten minutes you’ll say the rain’s the best part.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no, you worked out my cunning plan.” Diamond paused. “How did you manage to make the soup? What did you cook it in?”</p><p class="double">Both of them knew what Diamond was doing – trying to distract them from the storm. But it was nice to pretend they didn’t.</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is actually kinda neat,” Applebloom said. “You know how you heat up water and then it boils?”</p><p class="double">“I have noticed. Once or twice.” Diamond Tiara’s sarcasm was almost a physical object, no matter how brittle her voice was.</p><p class="double">“Good. Well, don’t know if you know <i>this</i> bit, but things have to heat up to burn too. It ain’t enough for them to be held in a fire. So, paper burns a lot easier than wood does.”</p><p class="double">There was an almighty <i>crash</i> from outside, and both fillies jumped.</p><p class="double">“Really makes one appreciate pegasi,” Diamond said shakily.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Applebloom agreed. “Anyway, as ah was sayin’, ah cooked it in a coconut. The coconut had to get so hot to catch fire that it couldn’t do that when there was water right next to it – the water would get to boilin’ long before the coconut would get to burnin’.”</p><p class="double">“Wow.” Diamond blinked. “That <i>is</i> neat. Why doesn’t Cheerilee ever teach us about that?”</p><p class="double">“’cuz if she gave us access to fire, then me and Sweetie and Scoots would probably burn the Everfree down,” Applebloom deadpanned.</p><p class="double">Mention of the other two Crusaders wounded the conversation severely, but it wasn’t more than another thirty seconds before Diamond Tiara got it going again with another question. “What about the hair?”</p><p class="double">“The coconut hair?” Applebloom grinned uneasily. “Well, see, ah kinda ruined the first batch, ‘cuz ah forgot to take the husk off…”</p><p class="double">Despite – or perhaps because of – the tenseness of the situation, Diamond Tiara giggled. That turned into a shriek when a lightning bolt struck <i>very</i> near by.</p><p class="double">“Y’ know, you probably saved mah life,” Applebloom said, into the relative stillness. “Ah was all for hidin’ under a tree, and ah think they’re supposed to either fall over or explode if they get hit. But this tree ain’t the tallest around, not any more, so it ain’t gonna get struck.”</p><p class="double">“Heh… does this mean I owe you less?” Diamond asked, still shivering. She felt Applebloom move closer, until they were touching.</p><p class="double">“There ain’t any question of who owes who, Diamond,” Applebloom said. “We work together, and we stay alive.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">The storm blew itself past them overnight. Exhausted, wet and emotionally drained, the two fillies fell asleep once the wind dropped and woke nearly at midday.</p><p class="double">The island – the one they’d started to think of as ‘their’ island – was an incredible mess. Trees were bereft of limbs, small floods had cut muddy incisions into the surface soil, and their beach-shelter had been carried away by the winds. The whole beach was covered with driftwood.</p><p class="double">“So much for a week o’ work,” Applebloom sighed. “Ah well. At least we got more wood to work with-”</p><p class="double">There was a sudden explosion of light, nearly overhead.</p><p class="double">“What’s that?” Diamond Tiara asked, squinting into the sky.</p><p class="double">Applebloom laughed, beating her hooves on the floor and then started dancing – not very well, of course. “Woo-hoo!”</p><p class="double">“What is it!?” the other filly insisted.</p><p class="double">“That’s a sonic rainboom!” Applebloom said, grinning fiercely. “There’s only one pony who can do one o’ those!”</p><p class="double">A purple flash appeared a few hundred yards down the beach.</p><p class="double">“Applebloom? Diamond Tiara? Wonderful!” Twilight shouted, galloping over. “Oh, I’m so sorry it took so long for us to find you!”</p><p class="double">“Well, ah could wish y’all had turned up sooner,” Applebloom said, still grinning with the euphoria of being finally rescued. “But it weren’t all that bad, ‘cept for the first day and the last.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, we saw the storm.” Twilight winced. “Must have been terrible.”</p><p class="double">“Diamond here found us a place to ride it out,” Applebloom said, nodding towards her. Said pink filly started at being addressed, looking a bit overwhelmed.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash landed next to Twilight. “Okay, I told the crew where we are. They should turn up by evening.”</p><p class="double">“Crew?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Twilight nodded. “I forgot to mention – Filthy Rich hired a zeppelin to help with the search. Dash and I have been using it to quarter the entire ocean, once Discord finally told us he put you on a desert island.”</p><p class="double">“Pity you didn’t manage to get him to say which one…” the young Apple groused.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara was nearly speechless. “Father hired a <i>Zeppelin?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Dash nodded. “He really <i>is </i>filthy rich, isn’t he? Hay, the Wonderbolts volunteered to help, too. It was just luck that I was on the south-flank sweep today.”</p><p class="double">Twilight eyed the two fillies, but said nothing about their unusual lack of friction. “Okay, want to show us around? We’ve got about four or five hours until <i>Jack of all trades</i> is within easy teleport range – I was pushing it a bit with that one…”</p><p class="double">Applebloom knew that was a flat lie, given that this was the Looping Twilight (as always), but didn’t press it. “Okay. Hey, Diamond, you found where we stayed last night, you show ‘em.”</p><p class="double">“O…okay.” Diamond looked around for a moment, getting her bearings. “Right. This way.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Hey, Diamond, you got a moment?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">The filly looked up. It was their third day back in Ponyville, and the first day back at school (the first had been consumed with reunions and the second with a combination of the press and medical checkups).</p><p class="double">“Uh…” for a moment, Diamond’s eyes flicked over to Silver Spoon, next to her.</p><p class="double">Applebloom held her breath.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Diamond got up. “Hang on a minute, Silver.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Silver Spoon nodded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Okay. There’s something ah didn’t tell you,” Applebloom said, once they were in a fairly out of the way corner. “This… is kinda hard to explain. Twilight does it better. Basically, ah’m one of a load of ponies in a time loop. Every few years, we go back to the day before that Summer Sun celebration where Nightmare Moon turned up. Not all of us always turn up, and ah’m one of them – Twilight’s the one who always does this…”</p><p class="double">“So… we’ve been through this before?” Diamond asked, eyes widening.</p><p class="double">Before she could decide what to feel, Applebloom waved her hooves. “No! The whole desert island thing, that ain’t never happened before. And ah’m going t’ try to make sure it ain’t never going to happen again.”</p><p class="double">“…do you mean it happens all the time, or…?”</p><p class="double">“No, that’s just me bein’ a farmgirl.” Applebloom scratched the back of her head. “Anyway, I just… wanted to let you know. It don’t feel right, keepin’ secrets from y’all after that.”</p><p class="double">“…I kind of have one too, then.” Diamond swallowed. “When you told me to imagine the tree was the thing I was the most annoyed with? It was, er, you and the other bl- the other crusaders.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom laughed. “That’s all? Ah kinda guessed it might be!” The laughter died down. “But thanks for tellin’ me.”</p><p class="double">“That’s okay.” Diamond smiled. “And thank you for telling me. Er… am I a… a bitch, in the other loops?”</p><p class="double">“Kinda, yeah.” Applebloom nodded. “Ah ain’t gonna lie. But it actually ain’t all that surprisin’, cause you’re ten and ah’m… lots.” She then looked around and whispered to the other filly. “It ain’t the first time you’ve saved mah life, either. It seems like whenever you’re in one o’ these loops and it goes strange, you’re actually kinda awesome.”</p><p class="double">Then the Apple gave a shrug. “Still a bitch… but an awesome bitch.”</p><p class="double">Diamond broke out laughing herself. After she’d managed to push it back to giggles, she said “well, if that’s the best I can get…”</p><p class="double">Applebloom grinned. “Hay, I dunno. There was this one time you were a magical filly warrior…”</p><p class="double">“Do you have pictures?” Diamond asked. Then frowned. “But… next time, I… oh, I wish I knew how to make it so I didn’t act so nastily to you.”</p><p class="double">Suddenly she gasped. “Wait, I know! It might work, anyway.”</p><p class="double">“What’s that?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“You know… <i>loads </i>of stuff from these loops, right? Make a business deal with my father, some time shortly after the Summer Sun celebration. It’s about two weeks after Nightmare Moon’s return that Father started walking me through our business partners and why they are what they are, so…” Diamond shrugged. “Best I can do, I think.”</p><p class="double">“…that might just be the best gift y’ could have given me, if it works,” Applebloom said. “Ah don’t want to have you as an enemy, in any life. Friends are much nicer.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Diamond replied, nodding. “They are. Sorry I didn’t know that before.”</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">14.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Goodness,” Princess Rarity said, looking around. “So <i>this</i> is what the Discordian era looked like. I have to say, he didn’t have much of a sense of style back then…”</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight Sparkle nodded. “Maybe it took him over a thousand years in a statue to think of good jokes?”</p><p class="double">“Possibly. Right, what happens now?”</p><p class="double">Twilight gestured to the other four elements. “Pick two, we have to use three each to do the sealing.”</p><p class="double">“Do we <i>have</i> to? I mean, can’t we just talk it out?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Twilight shook her head. “Fluttershy tried. It just… didn’t work. He’s not got the perspective being defeated can give you.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Rarity looked the elements over. “I pick… Kindness and Laughter.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight paused. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Because that way they are colour coordinated.” Rarity looked offended that Twilight even had to ask. “Alright, how do I put these on?”</p><p class="double">“Wings. Sorry, I never worked out a better way.” Twilight levitated the Loyalty and Honesty necklaces over her own wings, fastening them at the base.</p><p class="double">Visibly cringing, Rarity followed suit. “This looks dreadful.”</p><p class="double">“It’s Discord, he won’t mind.” Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Yes, but I <i>do</i>…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Look, Rarity,” Twilight said warily. “I’m just giving you a warning. Dash, Fluttershy and Applejack all overdid something massively when it was their turn with me in this loop variant, so…”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you worry too much,” Rarity replied. “Anyway, I have some political manoeuvring to get done. Remember? We agreed you got the natural world and I got the work of civilization.”</p><p class="double">“True…” Twilight nodded. “But I’m still… oh, maybe it <i>is</i> nothing.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Princess Rarity paced back and forth. “I don’t understand it! No matter how fabulous, ornate, utilitarian or subdued the clothes I create, the griffins don’t like them! We’re running a heavy trade deficit… I must find <i>something</i> that they like!”</p><p class="double">Her problem could be summed up with the fact that most supplies of cotton and silk came from the Griffin Lands. Since they had claws, as opposed to hooves, it was much easier for them to make fine cloth.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm… oh, this is so frustrating!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Okay, explain that again.”</p><p class="double">“So, we were running a trade deficit with the griffins,” Rarity began.</p><p class="double">“I got that bit.”</p><p class="double">“I discovered that the one product that we make which griffins are willing to purchase is our range of magical items.”</p><p class="double">“Okay…” Twilight pressed. “And how did you get from that to <i>invading their country?</i>”</p><p class="double">“I’m… not entirely sure,” Rarity said, frowning. “But it involved catnip at some point in the process. Possibly we started selling it to them, I’m not sure.”</p><p class="double">“So.” Twilight massaged her temples. “You <i>personally</i> invaded the Griffin Lands, overthrew their government, seized their entire supply of fabric for the last three years and went on a month-long bender making dresses.”</p><p class="double">“That about sums it up,” Rarity nodded.</p><p class="double">“Right. Sorry, but you’re probably going to have to head to the moon. Quite apart from anything else, we need to salvage Equestria’s international reputation – and that means making it clear you weren’t acting according to official policy. At least you didn’t take the army.”</p><p class="double">Rarity raised a hoof, then sighed. “Alright, Twilight. Sorry, it looks like I <i>did</i> go over the top.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, you think?” Twilight asked sarcastically. “Look, I’ll send you up some supplies or something. Make it a yearly event.”</p><p class="double">“Alright.” Rarity frowned. “But they’ll get so dusty if I just leave them there… perhaps I should send what I make back down again?”</p><p class="double">“Why not.” Twilight lifted up a calendar. “I think ‘Charity Day’ would work. The rich donate, the poor get the clothes.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good to me.” Rarity looked a bit more chipper. “Alright. See you in a millennium.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Sorry?” Celestia asked. “You want me to <i>what?</i>”</p><p class="double">“I want you and your sister to go dig Princess Rarity out,” Twilight repeated. “Since she may be a little… obsessed, after that long on the moon, you may need to find ponies who can operate the Elements of Harmony. Perhaps those friends Luna’s made in Ponyville?”</p><p class="double">“Alright…” Celestia said, dubiously. “But why dig her out?”</p><p class="double">“Off-cuts,” Twilight answered. “A thousand years of accumulated off-cuts from a thousand years of Charity Days.”</p><p class="double">The power-spell specialist unicorn left, still looking a bit flabbergasted.</p><p class="double">“It’ll be nice to see her again,” Spike said. “I didn’t know she’d ascended too.”</p><p class="double">“It was only last Loop,” Twilight explained. “I think this is the first time someone aside from me and the newest alicorn has been awake in one of these, actually.”</p><p class="double">“Neat. And, uh, thanks for hatching me so early.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. She’d hatched Spike’s egg personally the minute it turned up, meaning that the dragon was about thirty now and a well-known sight around the palace.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">14.6</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, you’ve got a blank flank!” Diamond Tiara shouted into the stillness of the cute-caneara, pointing at Applebloom’s exposed side.</p><p class="double">Applebloom winced. Not again-</p><p class="double">“No fair!”</p><p class="double">-wait, <i>what?</i></p><p class="double">The other ponies were looking at Diamond Tiara with equal confusion.</p><p class="double">“Well, she could have a talent in <i>anything</i>! Hay, I don’t even know <i>what</i> mine means…” Diamond indicated her own cutie mark. “I mean, what does that mean? I’m good at wearing jewellery?” Her tiara slipped down slightly. &quot;Guess not…&quot;</p><p class="double">There were giggles, and Applebloom watched in shock as Diamond Tiara proceeded to joke about every cutie mark in the room.</p><p class="double">When she got around to Applebloom, Diamond winked, and whispered “Gotcha there, Applebloom!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, are you-”</p><p class="double">Diamond nodded, and winked again. “Lucky you, huh?”</p><p class="double"><hr></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='15'></a><h3>Loops 15</h3>
<p>15.1 (expanded by Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash awoke lying down in a cloud over Ponyville. The sun was warm and the wind soft so instead of checking through her loop memories, apparently too much work for now, she lazily decided to check which other ponies were Awake. Feeling the connection to the Element of Loyalty she realized everypony was-</p><p class="double"><i>Pain.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Sorrow.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Hurt.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Desolation.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Grief.</i></p><p class="double">One of her friends was in pain. It couldn&#039;t be a physical feeling, because no physical injury would hurt so deeply or cause sadness so deep. <i>One of her friends needed her.</i> The response from the Element of Loyalty was as automatic as breathing: making a Sonic Rainboom from her lying position she flew in a direct line towards the source of this feeling. It was only moments later, only because she realized she was going to crash into her friends arriving at the front door, when she realized she was heading straight to the library.</p><p class="double">She managed to dodge them, though the library now had a Rainbow Dash shaped hole in a wall and had a few bookshelves that had to be organized, but it was all right as she could see Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, Fluttershy…</p><p class="double">&quot;You all right, Rainbow?&quot; Applejack asked, pushing some books off her.</p><p class="double">Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, AJ.&quot; Rainbow stood up and looked to her friends &quot;Must be Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Noting how Rarity, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie were already going into the next room Applejack nodded once and then pointed to them &quot;Come on, let&#039;s hurry.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy was glad all she and all her friends were awake this loop. She was sure none of them would have forgiven themselves if they were unable to do anything for Twilight because of not being awake, even if she&#039;d have preferred Rainbow not making another door in Twilight&#039;s house. But that barely mattered as they went to the bedroom, to meet Twilight Sparkle crying on her bed hugging a photo frame.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er… Twilight,&quot; Fluttershy blinked, &quot;what&#039;s the matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">Leaving the frame on the bed Twilight spread her hooves. Recognizing the signs of a recent bad experience, the others crowded around her to give her a group hug. To Applejack&#039;s surprise, Twilight started really wailing this time. Not just the confusion or sadness from one or other of the strange loops… this was a deeply personal grief. As time passed and the sun set she could feel the pain receding, if only slightly.</p><p class="double">Eventually Twilight hiccupped to a stop. &quot;Okay… sorry, guys. This was just…&quot; a sniffle. &quot;I hate this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bad Loop?&quot; Dash asked. &quot;How bad could it be?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not bad.&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;In many ways it was the complete opposite. Okay, basically, I was the only one there, and it was fairly close to our prime loop.&quot; she broke off to sniffle again. &quot;I thought it was just like baseline Equestria, actually, and I was planning on something to do with the – with Sombra, so I let things happen. But I got… attacked, by some kind of cult who wanted to resurrect Nightmare Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That doesn’t sound much like Equestria…&quot; Applejack muttered. &quot;All the cults ah ever heard of turned into fan clubs when the relevant god or alicorn turned back up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, there’s a reason this one was different.&quot; Twilight sniffed. &quot;But, basically, it was successful and really wrong at the same time. They got Nightmare Moon back, alright… but about Apple Bloom&#039;s age, with no memory of her past life and <i>not evil</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;I just…&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;I let my guard down. I was stupid, really. I know we – all Loopers – are prevented from having children by Yggdrasil, but I forgot why.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy felt a sinking feeling inside her when she realized what she would have done in Twilight&#039;s case. If this filly was a reincarnation from Nightmare Moon she would have been received so much rejection from many ponies, and if she really didn&#039;t have any memories from her time as Nightmare Moon, if she really wasn&#039;t evil, if this really was the chance to redeem the corruption on Princess Luna…</p><p class="double">&quot;You adopted her, I bet!” Pinkie said, as if completing Fluttershy&#039;s thoughts, then her face fell. &quot;Oh, Twilight…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Twilight croaked, taking the frame photo on her bed and showing the photo -of her and a black filly alicorn- to her friends. &quot;After all, if she really was a threat, Nightmare Moon was still weak so it was supposed to be safe. So I called her Nyx, and… and she was dear to me as anyone I’ve ever known. And…&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight didn’t finish. Everypony there felt her pain of what happened. One moment, Nyx was there… and the next, gone as if she’d never existed, and to never exist again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway,&quot; Twilight forced herself back up, &quot;I don’t really feel like dealing with Nightmare Moon this time… can you girls handle it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity pondered. &quot;Probably. Can I borrow the Element of Magic?&quot; Twilight wordlessly took it from her subspace pocket and placed it on Rarity&#039;s head. &quot;We won’t be subtle, though.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.2 (Another Kind of Magic fused loop)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Trixie is confused.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I know.” Twilight looked over. “Remember I mentioned the loops? Sometimes they do strange things like this.”</p><p class="double">“It is just Trixie’s luck that her first proper one is so unusual.” Trixie frowned, then her eyes widened. “Wow. Tri-I mean, <i>I</i>, have a whole new set of memories?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, those happen too,” Twilight said casually. “Apparently we’re sisters in all but name here. Neat.”</p><p class="double">“So…” Trixie grinned. “This is actually quite fun. Apparently that dragon of yours rather prefers me over you.”</p><p class="double">“Well, Spike isn’t mine, or yours. He’s his own being… we just pay him.” Twilight shrugged. “Actually, though… here’s the deal. I won’t get involved this Loop.”</p><p class="double">“In what?” Trixie frowned.</p><p class="double">“Well, I’ll still do all the library stuff, and so on. And help you out with learning more magic… but I won’t take the Element of Magic this time. It’s your turn.” Twilight grinned. “Consider it a final exam.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Trixie’s jaw dropped. “I can’t… I mean… you’re ridiculously skilled at magic! How could I be worthy of it if you-”</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “It’s sometimes hard to get the hang of just what the time loops mean, isn’t it? I’ve been Looping for a <i>long</i> time, Trixie. I’m not much like the introverted scholar who first went to Ponyville. In fact, you might find it easier making friends than I did. Just…” she made an indefinable gesture. “Make sure to be more like the Trixie that you became after Ponyille, not… before.”</p><p class="double">“You do not need to tell Trixie twice…” the blue-coated unicorn muttered. “And why do I remember your brother being very unfair to me?”</p><p class="double">Twilight scanned her own Loop memories. “That would be because this version of you likes setting off homemade explosives. Hey, look!” She opened a chest and brought out a scroll. “Twilight Sparkle’s five step checklist for when Trixie Lulamoon has access to explosives.”</p><p class="double">Trixie snatched it from her. “Stage four: duck and cover? And stage five is how to fill out an incident report for the Guard!”</p><p class="double">“Guess this version of me really knows you well,” Twilight teased.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, well done,” Twilight said, as Trixie climbed into bed in the library after a long day of celebration, for the return and purification of Princess Luna. “But… what did you say you did to Nightmare Moon?”</p><p class="double">Trixie paused, adjusting the covers. “Uhh… a flashbang spell that blinded her long enough for me to retrieve the elements, then I threw an anvil at her, launched a firework bigger than my entire body and blew half the castle wall off, then dropped the ceiling on her. After that I used a triple-detonation spell, an accurately kicked rock, an attracting point, and was about to start working up one of those Force Burst spells you taught me when the others arrived.”</p><p class="double">“…wow, overconfident much?” Twilight managed.</p><p class="double">“Actually, no,” Trixie flourished her hat. “Part of my talent <i>is</i> knowing how to trick a crowd – and so I launched a combination of highly pyrotechnical attacks mixed in with ridiculous cheap shots. It kept her off balance for long enough that the others could turn up, but I didn’t think I could actually beat her.”</p><p class="double">“No, for direct combat I usually have to use alicorn mode,” Twilight confirmed.</p><p class="double">Trixie stared at her. “You have to use <i>what?</i>”</p><p class="double">“…I’ll explain later.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Twilight paged through a book on Zebra potion making. “I wonder how that would work…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked over the pilfered map from the Canterlot guardhouses, and sent approval to the changeling who had stolen it. “Good, good. Not too much longer before we can strike…”</p><p class="double">There was a purple flash overhead.</p><p class="double"> <i>Intruder!</i> jangled through the empathic Changeling network, alerting the guards and sending them soaring into the air in their hundreds.</p><p class="double">By the time they reached the place the flash had occurred, however, there was nothing there. Not even on their empathic senses.</p><p class="double">Just a bottle, which said ‘open’.</p><p class="double">The changelings conferred amongst themselves, deciding to let their queen handle it. Accordingly, one of them picked it up – and it slipped out of his hooves.</p><p class="double"><i>Good going, Murphy…</i> every other changeling in the hive thought at once.</p><p class="double">Then the bottle smashed on the hive floor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight said, adjusting her binoculars. “Potion bottle applied to changeling hive. Bottle has been dropped, potion release anticipated at ten-twenty-three and fourteen seconds.”</p><p class="double">The magic-crystal recorder next to her took down every word.</p><p class="double">Then there was an almighty green flash and she was standing in Paradise Valley.</p><p class="double">“…oh, buck,” Twilight muttered. “Experiment conclusion: Love Poison applied to changelings results in explosive positive feedback. Not recommended.”</p><p class="double">She let out a long sigh. “Now I have to endure a Loop where Rainbow Dash dresses in style. Again.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Does any pony dare to challenge Trixie?”</p><p class="double">Twilight had a slight smile on her face. This was Trixie’s first ‘baseline’ loop, so it would be interesting to see how she handled it…</p><p class="double">This time, Applejack went first. She spun her lasso, demonstrating a most impressive grasp of how to handle a rope and how to make the practised little flips that would cause it to change direction seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “So, your weapon is a lasso. Interesting.” Trixie’s horn lit, and she unfolded the back half of her wagon to make a larger, square stage. “First fall, first contact or surrender?”</p><p class="double">Applejack blinked. “What?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Trixie <i>did</i> say challenge…” Trixie shrugged. “Trixie thought a battle would be more impressive.”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. This had the potential to go wrong…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Within five minutes, though, she saw that Trixie had judged right.</p><p class="double">Though it had the trappings of a duel or combat challenge, it was actually a bit more like a presentation match. Applejack used her lasso to try and catch Trixie, who evaded – barely, on many occasions – with fancy hoofwork or teleports. Trixie replied with a series of low-power spells, many of which Applejack blocked with the rope of the lasso itself and the rest of which just about missed.</p><p class="double">Overall, the effect was of a pair of closely matched and fast-thinking pair of ponies having a fun and entirely non-lethal ‘fight’. Trixie even came off worst, Applejack’s lasso coiling around her tail as she dodged and pulling her backwards before she managed to teleport out.</p><p class="double">A bell dinged as Trixie skidded to a stop from a shield-blocked buck. “Right, time is up.”</p><p class="double">Applejack stopped twirling her lasso, confused.</p><p class="double">The showmare trotted over to her and shook her hoof. “Trixie is most impressed. Good match.”</p><p class="double">Applause broke out.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After Dash had demonstrated her own skills, Trixie pondered for a moment. “Hmm… well, Trixie can’t fly. So no luck there. A race?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Dash replied, grinning. “What rules do you want to use?”</p><p class="double">Trixie held up a convenient book. “What about Canterlot rules, third revision, to the outskirts of the town and back?”</p><p class="double">Dash took the book, skimmed it for a bit and nodded. “Yeah! If you think you can beat me!”</p><p class="double">“On the starting blocks,” Trixie rejoined. “Put your muscles where your mouth is.”</p><p class="double">At the ‘go’, the pegasus shot off at high speed. Trixie ran after her, and then vanished in a puff of smoke.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” someone shouted.</p><p class="double">“That can’t be fair!” another pony said.</p><p class="double">Trixie materialized back on stage and crossed the finish line, then looked nonplussed at the booing coming from the crowd. “Oh, what is it now?”</p><p class="double">Twilight walked over, having worked out what was going on. “You did say Canterlot rules third revision, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Trixie nodded. “The ones which allow teleportation.”</p><p class="double">“No, that’s second. Third only permits non-cast magic.” Twilight pointed to the relevant line in the book.</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked. Blinked again, slowly and theatrically. “…oh. Oopsie…”</p><p class="double">The booing turned to giggles.</p><p class="double">“Oh, shut up!” Trixie said to the crowd, stamping a hoof foalishly. Her hat fell off. “Any pony could have done it!”</p><p class="double">Dash shout out of the sky, panting. “Okay, I guess you beat me. How the hay are you that fast?”</p><p class="double">More giggles.</p><p class="double">“…did I miss something?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After that, several more ponies tried their hoof at challenging Trixie to something. Several of them lost, more of them won, and Trixie usually either made them look good or made herself look the fool, or more often both.</p><p class="double">Though Derpy’s trick, which involved a Klein bottle, just let her to scratch her head and give up.</p><p class="double">Finally, she challenged Twilight directly. This time, she let Twilight pick the form of the challenge.</p><p class="double">Twilight mused for a moment, and decided.</p><p class="double">Tennis. With fireballs.</p><p class="double">It was already fairly impressive when there was one fireball going. It was a lot more so when, on an unseen signal, both Trixie and Twilight lobbed another fireball each into the air. And when there were no fewer than fifteen fireballs going back and forth, it started to become obvious that there wasn’t going to be a quick winner in this challenge.</p><p class="double">After about ten minutes, Twilight called a halt. “I think we’ll call that a draw.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed,” Trixie said, panting a lot more than Twilight was. But then, she’d been on the go all afternoon. “Good game, Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">Trixie gave her a bow, then extended that to her whole audience and many challengers. “And Trixie hopes you have enjoyed the show!”</p><p class="double">Fireworks went soaring into the air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Trixie asked, that evening in the Books and Branches. “How was that?”</p><p class="double">Then she frowned. “Though I wonder where you put that chair I brought from Canterlot when we moved…”</p><p class="double">“That was last Loop, it didn’t happen in this Equestria,” Twilight reminded her. “I know it’s tricky to keep track. And yes, I’m very impressed with how mature you were.”</p><p class="double">“It <i>was</i> hard,” Trixie admitted. “But at least this time there hopefully won’t be an Ursa attack.”</p><p class="double">Something roared in the distance.</p><p class="double">“…oh, you are kidding me.” Trixie sighed, and picked her hat up off the floor. “Can I count on your help?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Twilight headed for the door. “And yeah, this might not happen <i>every</i> time, but it happens <i>far</i> too often.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hi, Matilda!” Pinkie said cheerfully, mentally crossing her hooves. “What brings you into town today?”</p><p class="double">“Ah, hello, Pinkie.” Matilda nodded to her. “It’s good to see you. Well, actually, I wanted to buy some carrots and flour. I plan to make a carrot cake.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, neat!” Pinkie’s smile lit up the square. “I know a Carrot Cake! Well, a different kind of carrot cake… anyway, I know how to make an edible carrot cake too! Hold on a minute, I’ve got a special recipe!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie hurried back into the shop and started looking, half her mind counting. <i>Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen…</i></p><p class="double">On ‘twenty-three’, she bounced back out again with the recipe and handed it to Matilda. “Here you go! I’m afraid it needs to have a <i>few</i> things that aren’t on a normal carrot cake recipe, but I know just where to get them. Applejack’s stall started having a sideline in oranges recently, so you can ask for orange peel there – or just whole oranges and eat the rest, if you want to be daring.” Pinkie giggled. “And the raisins are sold over there, by Sour Grapes.”</p><p class="double">“Is he… sour?” Matilda asked.</p><p class="double">“Nah, he’s really sweet. But Sweet Grapes isn’t as funny so he wasn’t called that.” Pinkie shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Thank you, Pinkie.” Matilda picked up the flour that Pinkie had put on the table when she wasn’t looking and paid for it. Pinkie’s gaze alternated between Matilda and the other side of the square.</p><p class="double">“Oh, did you hear the one about the bats?” Pinkie suddenly said.</p><p class="double">“No, I didn’t,” Matilda replied politely.</p><p class="double">“Neither did I, but I bet they did.” Pinkie huffed. “Bats hear all the best jokes. Stupid ears…”</p><p class="double">The donkey giggled. “Ah, Pinkie, you always surprise me. Well, thank you again!”</p><p class="double">“No problem!” Pinkie smiled, then started handling the next customer. <i>That joke should have just about done it…</i></p><p class="double">There was a commotion across the square as Lyra stepped up to the counter.</p><p class="double"><i>Yes!</i> “Excuse me,” Pinkie asked the green unicorn, and shot over there.</p><p class="double">Two shoppers had collided, as one of them wasn’t looking where he was going. Pinkie helped both of them up, babbling something about how if they’d bumped together closer to a bush she could have helped them with any boo-boos, because she had medical kits hidden all around Ponyville in case of… well, emergency.</p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry,” Pinkie said, “where are my manners! I’m Pinkie Pie, and this is Matilda. Who are you?”</p><p class="double">“Cranky Doodle. And-” the donkey froze. Pointed at who he’d bumped into. “I remember you.”</p><p class="double">Matilda gasped.</p><p class="double">Pinke gave them some space. She wasn’t the kind of pony who would interrupt a happy reunion.</p><p class="double">But she’d have to get permission to organize a <i>carnival</i> after this. There was party going to waste!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.6 (Elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The door to the Sweet Apple Acres farmhouse creaked on hinges that honestly ought to be oiled at some point. Applejack made a note to ask her sister to do it in the morning, then looked to the reason for her door-opening.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle stood on the threshold, her hair distorted in unkempt disarray, framing bloodshot eyes underscored by black circles. Applejack looked askance at her friend as the purple unicorn stood in the light shed from the doorway, a slice of brightness against Luna&#039;s backdrop… and left eyelid twitching. </p><p class="double">&quot;Can ah help ya, Twilight?&quot; the farmpony asked, with some trepidation.</p><p class="double">Purple eyes moved, shifting from gazing into empty space to fixate on Applejack. </p><p class="double">&quot;I finally figured it out.&quot;</p><p class="double">One of Applejack&#039;s eyebrows quirked. </p><p class="double">&quot;Figured what out, Twi?&quot;</p><p class="double">The manic grin never faltered even as the unicorn it belonged to spouted exposition. </p><p class="double">&quot;Why nothing seems to go wrong anymore. I told myself I&#039;d let this loop develop naturally, but something keeps changing it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s quirked eyebrow shifted to meet its counterpart, shifting from curiosity to skepticism. </p><p class="double">&quot;Beg pardon?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think it started just after we defeated Nightmare Moon. Remember how Rainbow Dash, Rarity and Pinkie Pie pestered me about going to the Grand Galloping Gala?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. &quot;Yep. Took y&#039;all pretty much the entire day to get them to lay off ya before th&#039; Princess sent ya more tickets.&quot;</p><p class="double">A purple eyelid twitched. </p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed. But you ALL were supposed to be obsessed with going.&quot;</p><p class="double">A hoarse voice interrupted Twilight&#039;s tirade and caused Applejack to divide her attention momentarily. &quot;Applejack, who is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s Twilight, but she don&#039;t seem right in the head.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Course she ain&#039;t. Ye&#039;ve kept th&#039; poor thing on th&#039; doorstep for a while now, invite her in!&quot; Granny Smith said with assurance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, Granny. Why don&#039;t ya come in, Twilight, and explain around the fire?&quot;</p><p class="double">Violet bangs rippled back and forth as Twilight Sparkle&#039;s head shook in response, and she continued. </p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s happened other times. Fluttershy for instance. When we went to confront that dragon that was blotting out the sun, she grew the confidence to pull through almost a quarter of the way up the mountain. She was meant to not overcome her fears until she was at the top. Mayor Mare knew to put me in with the organizing committee right out of the gate. We visited Cloudsdale without a hitch. Met Zecora so naturally, when ponies had been avoiding her for months. Resolving the Appleoosa situation before it escalated. I never did find out why Discord never showed his face. The parasprites I traced though.I&#039;ve seen it all play out countless times, and there have been changes before. But not this go &#039;round. This started as a baseline Loop. I meant to leave it that way, or work out why it wasn’t one. But I&#039;ve figured it out. Traced it all back to one somepony.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack looked at her friend askance. </p><p class="double">&quot;Care to clarify?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Somepony else knows what&#039;s going to happen ahead of time, and has been changing things so it happens more gently, or the problem doesn&#039;t occur at all. Countless disasters have been averted already.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack relaxed slightly, a smile playing at her lips, even as confusion threatened to slip behind her eyes. </p><p class="double">&quot;Well if&#039;n they&#039;re makin&#039; things easier, ah don&#039;t quite see th&#039; problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stamped a hoof against the threshold, the wood responding with a *thunk* that punctuated her statement.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s the thing, you have no idea how this has affected the timestream, many valuable lessons haven&#039;t been learnt!&quot;</p><p class="double">A frown of doubt crossed Applejack&#039;s face as she responded. </p><p class="double">&quot;Now that&#039;s just plain wrong. Y&#039;can&#039;t judge somepony by the disasters they avert. Seems to me that&#039;s the opposite of what ya should be doin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">By this point, the other Apples had taken notice of the debate going on across the doorstep. Granny Smith had a hoof to her ear, straining to make the discussion audible. Applebloom was riveted, her eyes and ears soaking in every word. Big Macintosh was just peering over the top of a farmer&#039;s almanac, taking in the scene quietly. Twilight&#039;s tirade continued. </p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#039;t have worried so much if they&#039;d come round and told me what was going on, then I would have been sure this was a normal loop. But nooo. They just continued on. Another pony might have been flashier, utilized the situation more directly to their benefit. Taken some credit, acted more directly or netted some abnormally large benefit. But not our culprit. They&#039;re subtle-like. Degrees of separation, a word here, some wisdom there, a bit of encouragement or a pick-me-up right when it&#039;s needed, so very innocuous. That&#039;s why it took so long for me to realize who was behind it. He almost got away with it too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Behind Applejack, her younger sister was staring slack-jawed at her brother. </p><p class="double">Big Macintosh the Looper had turned an even brighter shade of red than normal, and he was being careful to avoid eye contact with anypony. </p><p class="double">&quot;Shucks.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Good news,” Twilight said, passing Trixie some herbal tea. (The showmare had encountered the blend last Loop, learning what Zecora had to teach her, and taken to it with gusto.) “I think I’ve worked out a way to get you introduced to Ponyville early.”</p><p class="double">“You have?” Trixie blinked. “I thought I usually turned up fairly early…”</p><p class="double">“Fairly, yes,” Twilight dragged the words out, “but not soon enough that I can finagle you an invitation to the Grand Galloping Gala. I know you like that sort of thing.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “Fair point. Can I have Rarity make me a dress made of fire?”</p><p class="double">“I… actually don’t think she’s Awake this time, so only if she is when you next turn up.” Twilight shrugged. “Sorry.”</p><p class="double">“Ah well.” Trixie gave a theatrical sigh. “I suppose I’ll have to rely on my dazzling wit to wow the crowd.”</p><p class="double">“Knowing Canterlot nobility…” Twilight stopped, and pondered. “That might actually work. They do tend to spend a fair fraction of their time coming up with cutting barbs and performing social manoeuvring.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway.” Trixie tossed her head. “With that out of the way, what is this plan?”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight winked. “Basically, I think by now you can technically count as an old friend. So I’ll simply set things up with an old friend so that they perform the opening act at the Summer Sun festival.”</p><p class="double">Trixie gulped. “…doesn’t that mean Nightmare Moon will come onto the stage directly behind Trixie?”</p><p class="double">The Anchor shrugged. “Basically. But my brother worked out a spell that should help keep you safe – I can cast it on you before you go up.” Twilight began counting under her breath, then looked up again. “Actually, I have… a spare Intelligent Device, a copy of a thing called the Rainbow of Light, a full set of battle armour from when I recruited you as the head of my guard – back before you Awakened – and…”</p><p class="double">Giggling at Trixie’s gradually opening mouth (and expression like Hearth’s Warming had come early), Twilight rummaged in her subspace pocket. “Aha!”</p><p class="double">Twilight sprinkled what she’d found on the table. “Twenty-four Cartridges for an Intelligent Device’s feed mechanism. That’s enough for two reloads, assuming you go in with six in the chamber and we spend six practising.”</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked. “Are you trying to set me up to fight Nightmare Moon?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight nodded. “I think I taught you all the really powerful spells over the last few Loops, and an Intelligent Device isn’t actually all that hard to learn to use. Since the plan is to do this next time you’re Awake, we can probably get that practise in now.” Then the purple unicorn grinned. “Even <i>if</i> the result is a stalemate or that you eventually get beaten – and I honestly don’t know which way it would end up going – then it should at least look like you’ve brought me time to get the Elements running.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Trixie’s face set. “That does sound like quite the introduction.”</p><p class="double">“That’s the plan.” Twilight frowned. “Oh, don’t forget your Element, either. The passive power of the Element of Magic does things like make spells more efficient, which should help.”</p><p class="double">“To say the least…” Trixie muttered. “Trixie cannot believe she is doing this.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Anyway. Any pony here from Manehattan?”</p><p class="double">Some of the audience raised their hooves.</p><p class="double">“Well, so much for thirty percent of Trixie’s material.” Trixie pulled some pages out of her stack of notes and crumpled them up, then threw them away.</p><p class="double">Looking at what was left, she blinked… then cantered across the stage to where the bits had gone and picked them up. “That was not according to plan. Trixie definitely did not plan to crumple up the page she was on. Anyway…”</p><p class="double">She pointed at a pony in the audience. “What is it that you do?”</p><p class="double">“Me?” The pony looked around. “Er… I sell quills and sofas.”</p><p class="double">“Quills and sofas.” Trixie nodded. “Right. Trixie supposes that makes as much sense as anything. But doesn’t it get you down sometimes?”</p><p class="double">There was scattered laughter.</p><p class="double">“The rest of you can ask whoever’s closest to you who actually got the joke,” Trixie said with a sigh.</p><p class="double">This time, there was a bit more laughter.</p><p class="double">“It’ll do.” Trixie leafed through her notes. “You’re not getting this whole gig, are you, audience? Trixie tells jokes, you laugh. That is how it is supposed to work.”</p><p class="double">She put them back down on the nearby lectern. “So, anyway. The Summer Sun festival. Longest day of the year. Trixie can’t help but think we might have got the wrong end of this one, to be honest. I mean, it’s four AM and here we are, up before the sun. If ever there was a day to be asleep when the sun’s up, it’s when the sun’s up for <i>so much</i> of it.”</p><p class="double">Suddenly, there was a commotion backstage.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon stepped through the curtain, batting away incoming guards. “Oh, my beloved subjects-”</p><p class="double">Trixie interrupted her. “You.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon focused on her, an expression of astonishment on her face. “Why do you provoke me?”</p><p class="double">“My name is Trixie Lulamoon. You interrupted my comedy routine.” Trixie grinned as the adrenaline began to kick in. “Prepare to cry.”</p><p class="double">She heard Twilight’s voice taking charge behind her, evacuating the building, and reached out to the contingent spells Twilight had helped her set up.</p><p class="double">One-two-three, and she was ready for this.</p><p class="double">Hat and cape were in place, though the clasp for her cape had been replaced by the Rainbow of Light. Beneath her hat was concealed her Element of Magic – a slim circlet with a wand at the top – and her new Intelligent Device, Loki, was held in one hoof.</p><p class="double">But what really showed something was different was the <i>armour</i>. Twilight had made it to the same standards as the Princesses’ own battle armour, and it showed. (It also held the bound-spell version of Shining’s protective enchantment, the other end of which was apparently keyed to an entire mountain.)</p><p class="double"><u>Stand by, ready. Set up.</u></p><p class="double">Loki finished the preparations, hovering over her right shoulder in staff form.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked. “What-”</p><p class="double">“You wanted to come back here after a thousand years?” Trixie asked. “Come back and take over as though you’d never tried to usurp sole rule in the first place?”</p><p class="double">“My night never got the attention it deserved!” Nightmare Moon shouted back. “It-”</p><p class="double">Trixie held up a hoof. “Wait a moment. While this is probably going to end up as a fight, I deplore starting a fight in which I don’t have the element of surprise.”</p><p class="double">Before Nightmare Moon had <i>quite</i> finished processing that sentence, Trixie launched off a Missile Storm, and then things got quite loud.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight winced as the town hall exploded. “That’s going to be costly to fix…”</p><p class="double">Mind you, it was <i>hardly</i> the first time Ponyville had needed substantial rebuilding. Well, it was the first this Loop, but it seemed to average three or four times per Loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie teleported away from an attack by a sliver of a second, fired off three illusions – two of them obvious, one of them just within what she guessed was Nightmare Moon’s skill to localize – and used the moment of confusion to expend three cartridges.</p><p class="double">The resultant lightning bolt split the night, shaking the ground and hammering through most of Nightmare Moon’s defences. As she turned to locate the origin point of the blast, a tree fell on her.</p><p class="double">“Always the way,” Trixie said to herself. “Misdirection. Feint, feint, kick to the head. Loki, Blaster One.”</p><p class="double"><u>Affirmative. Blaster One engaged.</u></p><p class="double">Two semi-autonomous blaster bits flew out of Loki’s launch bay, leaving four still in there. That let her split her fire more effectively, but she still had to actually <i>cast</i> all the spells herself and her horn was starting to ache.</p><p class="double"><i>Let it! This is the most fun I’ve had in SO long!</i></p><p class="double">Another dark bolt flew off the Nightmare’s horn, hitting her in the thigh. Protective magic crackled, and what would probably have blown her apart became just a faint ache in the left rear leg. Though there was probably a chunk of mountain missing somewhere.</p><p class="double">As the battle escalated, she started relying on Nanoha-style spells more. Thrown objects, fireworks, illusions and just the occasional loud noise had their place, but to actually keep Nightmare Moon off balance took some serious firepower – if she didn’t feel under threat, she’d stop taking the distractions seriously.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare snarled, as another of the annoying unicorn’s illusions turned to dust under a Dark Bolt.</p><p class="double">This was the most infuriating foe she had <i>ever</i> faced! The illusions were too good for her to properly unravel half the time, and when they weren’t they were just there to make her <i>think</i> something. She was being manipulated, and didn’t like it.</p><p class="double">And she had to treat all the illusions as serious threats, too, which meant spending FAR too much magic on them. Earlier, the unicorn – Trixie something – had somehow endured an attack that would have blown a hole in a castle wall, and probably the whole castle.</p><p class="double">Another illusion appeared, this one just a little bit off. Nightmare Moon determined to ignore it, focusing on the slightly better-hidden signature which could be-</p><p class="double">And then a bolt of blue magic speared out of what she’d written off as an illusion, smashing her in the flank and nearly knocking her over.</p><p class="double">Then a house landed on her.</p><p class="double">Snarling, Nightmare Moon disintegrated the house and took to the air. That pesky unicorn couldn’t be up here!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Flier Fin.</u></p><p class="double">Trixie winced as Nightmare Moon started levelling the town, methodically pulverizing buildings one by one. <i>Better them than me… that protection spell is feeling ragged.</i></p><p class="double">“The illusion is working?” she asked, hoofing the spent cartridges out of Loki and loading her last six.</p><p class="double"><u>Affirmative.</u></p><p class="double">“Good… and the town <i>is</i> clear?”</p><p class="double"><u>Indeed.</u> A pause. <u>The answer is the same as last time you asked.</u></p><p class="double">“Sorry.”</p><p class="double">Trixie looked around. All six of the blaster bits were active… she still had enough magic… and Nightmare Moon was still shooting things only she could see.</p><p class="double">“Cartridge load.”</p><p class="double">Loki fired off all six remaining cartridges, and Trixie’s reserves swelled back to full. Enough.</p><p class="double">Then she dispelled the illusion she’d been maintaining. Across Nightmare Moon’s eyes and ears.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked as the town below her wavered like smoke. <i>What-</i></p><p class="double">“Hey!”</p><p class="double">She turned towards the origin of the voice, and saw that infernal unicorn again. Hovering in mid aid, exactly as Nightmare had thought she couldn’t. Gratifyingly, Nightmare had apparently done some damage – the armour was torn in places, and Trixie’s hat was missing. But-</p><p class="double">There was a ball of magic building on the end of that strange staff thing.</p><p class="double">And something atop the unicorn’s head, which felt surprisingly familiar. A circlet of crystal, with the wand atop it burning with an intense blue flame.</p><p class="double">Then, two objects darted from nowhere and wrapped a golden chain around her middle, holding her in place.</p><p class="double">“It’s called Enkidu,” Trixie said. “It’s the most powerful binding spell I know, so it should hold for at least a few minutes. I just wanted to explain something to you.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare growled.</p><p class="double">“Villains – evil doers – ponies who want to be powerful, who want to win and who want to rule over others. They’re always the ones who have all the impressive powers. They’re the ones who you read the stories, and you think ‘wow. I didn’t know any pony could do that.’ You want to be able to do what they could.” Trixie shook her head. “But you never want to <i>be</i> them. And that’s because of something that… almost everyone understands, somewhere deep down. It’s that being selfish doesn’t really work.”</p><p class="double">“And that’s for a good reason.” As Trixie continued, Nightmare Moon caught sight of four other objects, each of them with the same gradually growing ball of magic as the staff.</p><p class="double">“Basically, good ponies aren’t any less powerful than evil ones. In fact, because they cooperate, because they learn from one another, they can become more powerful. No, it is something else… Tell Trixie, one thousand years ago… did your sister ever fight you?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare blinked. “…no. She just hit me with the Elements of Harmony.”</p><p class="double">“And do you think that that was because you could defeat her?” Trixie bobbed her head. “Possibly, possibly. But there’s another good reason. Look at the town below you.”</p><p class="double">The bindings gave Nightmare enough movement to do so.</p><p class="double">“See how devastated it is? That’s the point. Good ponies aren’t less powerful. They just care more about collateral damage.”</p><p class="double">Trixie grinned. “But this town was evacuated. Starlight Breaker.”</p><p class="double">Five bolts of surprisingly pink magic erupted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie coughed. “Ow. My horn hurts.”</p><p class="double">“I bet it does…” Twilight said, trotting briskly over. “Did you really have to do this much damage?”</p><p class="double">The blue pony giggled. “So much for being accepted…” After a moment, Trixie shook her head, and recovered some of her composure. “I think I did fairly well, actually.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, you did. You tricked a goddess, manoeuvred her into a trap, and then hit her with enough magic that she…” Twilight craned over the rubble of a wall, “Seems to be cured, actually. Guess Nanoha universe magic really can just about manage it, with enough boosts. Congratulations…”</p><p class="double">Twilight conjured a mirror.</p><p class="double">“…Princess Trixie.”</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked, taking in the sight of her new wings. “Oh.” Then she frowned. “Wait a minute. Was this your plan all along?”</p><p class="double">“…kinda.” Twilight shrugged. “I honestly had no idea if it’d work, but even if it didn’t it would still be a useful test.”</p><p class="double">“You should have told me!” Trixie accused. “Turning ponies into deities without their permission is… er… Trixie was going to say impolite, but she thought impossible would have fit until a few hours ago, so she stands corrected.”</p><p class="double">“I don’t really know if it would even <i>work</i> like that,” Twilight admitted. “Anyway, no harm done, right?”</p><p class="double">“No, Trixie supposes not.” The new alicorn then slumped over and started snoring.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah, leave me to explain everything…” Twilight groused.</p><p class="double">Celestia appeared in a flash of light. “Twilight! What happened here? And… wait, is that my sister?”</p><p class="double">“No, cutie mark’s wrong. Though she <i>is</i> called Lulamoon…” Twilight pointed. “Luna’s over there.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.8</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity stepped outdoors, and breathed deeply. <i>Ah, midsummer’s eve.</i></p><p class="double">A new Loop, and new opportunities.</p><p class="double"><i>Wonder who else is Awake…</i> she pondered with half her mind, the other half trying to decide what was ‘in’ this Loop.</p><p class="double"><i>Ooh, perhaps I could go with a theme focused on birds? It would be simply </i>marvellous!</p><p class="double">With a flash of green fire, something appeared in front of her. Surprised, she caught it. <i>Now what does Twilight want this time?</i></p><p class="double">The envelope was alabaster in colour and slightly scented with saffron. Frowning, she opened it, and took out the letter.</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Rarity,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Spike here. I thought I should let you know that I’ve finally actually started Looping. Twilight let me know that you were Awake this time, and so I thought I’d try going about this whole thing… right.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I know I had a silly crush on you. I would like to hope that that crush has gone away with maturity, but I can’t be sure, since I certainly don’t feel any less attracted to you.</i></p><p class="double"><i>If I was a proper dragon, I’d probably try to steal you away, or something like that. But I’m not, so… I’d like to do something a bit more sensible.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I’ve made a reservation for two seats in a restaurant in Canterlot, for the evening meal – the one run by Blue Cordon. Twilight’s agreed to help with the teleportation required, so I would be honoured if you would give me the pleasure of your company.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Yours,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Spykoranuvellitar (Spike).</i></p><p class="double"><i>P.S: Twilight found a way to help me change my physical age. I won’t look like a baby, so don’t worry on that front.</i></p><p class="double">Rarity blinked.</p><p class="double">Then started to smile. “Well, he certainly doesn’t do things by halves… I can never be sure of managing to get a meal there. Wonder how he got the reservation…”</p><p class="double">Yes, this could be interesting. Spiky-wikey was always so sweet, and this much more mature Spike – she’d never seen or heard him use his full name before…</p><p class="double"><i>Most</i> interesting.</p><p class="double">Then she gasped. “Only seven hours to do all the normal preparations and get ready! And I <i>must</i> look my best! Oh, maybe I should make him a suit as well! No, perhaps that would be taken as an insult…”</p><p class="double">She shot back into the boutique, already planning what she was going to make. Romantic dinner, simple meal, or whatever else it turned out to be, she was <i>not</i> going to waste the chance to show off her dressmaking skills in <i>the</i> premier Canterlot restaurant!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thanks,” Spike said, scratching the back of his head. “I know this is short notice…”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no problem,” Cadence assured him. “In all honesty, Shining and I had booked the seats before we discovered that his parents would be free this evening. We’ll be able to visit Twilight Twinkle and Night Light – that’ll probably be just as nice.” She giggled. “<i>Shining</i> certainly thought so! I swear, he calls that formal outfit of his – the one he’d have had to wear there – worse than full plate armour. I barely had time to suggest it before he agreed.”</p><p class="double">Then she grew sly. “Besides, what else am I doing here, but my job?”</p><p class="double">Spike coughed. “Well, yes, that is my hope. But I’d rather it all start slow.”</p><p class="double">“Good attitude.” Cadence nodded. “Try to win a lover, and you might gain an enemy. But try to gain a friend, and you might just win a lover…”</p><p class="double">This time the dragon blushed slightly, and adjusted the tie she’d helped him with.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” Rarity said, halfway through the main course. (She was having something inventive involving bamboo shoots stuffed with cheese; Spike had opted for a pasta dish.) “<i>Do</i> tell me, Spike. How on Equestria did you get us a table at such short notice?”</p><p class="double">Spike smiled, ever so slightly nervously. “Well, Cadence and Shining had a reservation they didn’t particularly want to make use of – apparently they booked it well in advance, and then it turned out that Twilight’s parents were having a night in.” The dragon – currently about the same size as Rarity – broadened his smile. “More power to them.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed – I wish I’d known about that. But, then, you have rather more of an in with the two of them than I do.” Rarity paused, checking that the table was indeed far enough from other ponies who might overhear them. “How did she handle your unexpected size increase?”</p><p class="double">The dragon shrugged, and swallowed his latest mouthful. “I passed it off as a growth spurt, to tell the truth. It isn’t as though dragon biology is well enough understood to preclude it.”</p><p class="double">“Of course.” Rarity nodded along with the explanation. Then she put a hoof to her chin in thought, expertly keeping the fabric of her sleeve from touching the table. “Though – one has to wonder. Have you taken advantage of the… well, the loops, when I wasn’t present, to… become involved with me?”</p><p class="double">Spike hid his discomfort at the topic. Then decided he didn’t need to, and permitted a wince to escape. “Honestly… yes. One which was the first time I’d actually turned up in Equestria itself, and then another time about two loops after that.”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. “I’m glad you let me know. How did it go?”</p><p class="double">“The first time…” Spike smiled slightly. “Basically, I saved you from the Diamond Dogs – rather than you save yourself, I mean. I like to think I was quite dashing, but…” The dragon shrugged. “I <i>was</i> still young, then. Twilight and I hadn’t worked out the age changing trick yet. In any case, the farthest it got was that we went to the Gala together a few times.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn digested the information. “I imagine I was quite grateful. The first time… those dogs were <i>scary</i>.”</p><p class="double">“You were.” Spike sighed. “I felt really good about it, actually… but, at the same time, there was this nagging question at the back of my mind. Two, really. The first one was <i>is this right?</i> I mean, I was using my knowledge of the future to develop a relationship with a pony who hadn’t… it kind of felt wrong.”</p><p class="double">“And the second one?” Rarity asked, when he didn’t continue.</p><p class="double">“I couldn’t shake the feeling that you saw me as a child. You probably did.”</p><p class="double">“I’d say… more than that, probably,” Rarity replied, thinking back to her own mental state from all those years ago. “I always did like a knight in shining armour – though not the actual Shining Armor, of course.”</p><p class="double">Both of them chuckled.</p><p class="double">“I imagine I did have some stronger feelings for you, but…” Rarity shrugged, sending the dress rippling and causing the colours down it to change as she moved. “Well, I’d have wanted to wait until your majority.”</p><p class="double">“Which would never come, of course, but you couldn’t know that.” Spike took a drink from his glass – he’d asked for the sourest vintage they had, which had raised a few delicately manicured eyebrows but which suited him quite fine. (They’d been grateful to be able to sell something they’d have had to throw out, once he explained the biology involved.)</p><p class="double">“What was the second time?”</p><p class="double">“That was… stranger.” Spike shrugged. “I got Twilight to try turning me into a pony, basically. Stupidest idea I’ve ever had. I didn’t get far with you…”</p><p class="double">Rarity giggled despite herself. “Oh, dear. Sorry, Spike, but… that <i>is</i> rather a funny image.”</p><p class="double">The dragon nodded. “Yeah, once I got a bit of perspective I could see how it was funny too. I was trying to look all suave when I didn’t even know how to <i>walk</i> properly, it must have been dreadful.”</p><p class="double">“And after that?”</p><p class="double">“I… just didn’t bother. Partly because of those same problems I mentioned, but partly…” Spike sighed. “I don’t want it to be… or… okay. In simple terms: I <i>think</i> that I love you. But I can’t be sure. I don’t know if this is still a crush, I don’t know if… well, if the things which I like about the… the <i>you</i> that I know, are the ones which you like about yourself. The ones you’ve kept. And I don’t know if you like <i>me</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Which me do you mean this time?” Rarity said quietly.</p><p class="double">“The… looping you. I… basically, it’s like I knew what you were like as a child. And like you knew what I was like as a child.” The dragon rubbed his forehead. “So, before I – before either of us starts even thinking about going further, we should make sure we each know what the other is actually like.” Spike then flashed a grin, this one with a lot more humour in it. “Hi. I’m Spykoranuvellitar, but everyone calls me Spike, and I’m Twilight Sparkle’s assistant. What’s your name?”</p><p class="double">Rarity matched the smile. “Rarity. I’m a dressmaker, and I like making magical items as well.”</p><p class="double">“Nice to meet you, then.”</p><p class="double">Then they remembered the meal, which had sadly cooled off a bit.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.9</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Mister dragon?”</p><p class="double">The dragon who had set up in the mountains overlooking Ponyville opened one eye. “What is it, little pony?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy pressed the tips of her hooves together. “Well, you see, we’re having a bit of a smoke problem. We were wondering if you could stop?”</p><p class="double">That only got laughter. “Why should I stop? Are you going to make me, little pony?”</p><p class="double">“I’d… really rather not,” Fluttershy said, “but if I have to, then I will.”</p><p class="double">More laughter.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy’s eyes hardened. “Alright, then. Angel? Sic ‘em.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom held up cards. “Eight point six!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo disagreed. “Only four point five, I think. He’s really not controlled his landing well.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle held hers up. “Six and a half. I really like the startled yowp noise he made.”</p><p class="double">There was a <i>crack</i>, as Angel Bunny kicked the dragon entirely into the air a second time. The three fillies gauged this new trajectory, and then started holding up more scorecards.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How did you do this?” Twilight asked. “Whatever it was, it was cool…”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Fluttershy blushed. “I basically made Angel my animal companion – you know, like druids have. And then I went alicorn and pumped more power into him.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, watching Angel twist all six of his target’s limbs into a single chokehold. “I have to say, he took to it well.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">15.1 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;By the way, Rarity,&quot; Fluttershy asked, when they were arriving to Ponyville Town Hall in preparation to take care of Nightmare Moon, &quot;why did you ask Twilight for the Element of Magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I want to try wearing and using it. Doesn&#039;t it look fabulous on me? I must definitely must have a few pictures taken wearing it.&quot; Rarity posed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You sure it&#039;s gonna work, sugarcube?&quot; Applejack asked as she, like the others, summoned their Elements.</p><p class="double">The white unicorn frowned slightly. &quot;Not really. But in that case we are still five alicorns against one.&quot;</p><p class="double">The rest of the night was a silent wait. Even the usually energetic Pinkie Pie wasn&#039;t in the mood for talking, everypony mourning Twilight&#039;s loss.</p><p class="double">Eventually, Rainbow Dash pointed to the moon, now without the alicorn shaped shadow. &quot;Here she comes.&quot; That was all the signal Rarity and the others needed to start activating the elements, from a place hidden enough to conceal them, so that they’d be ready by the time Nightmare Moon made her appearance.</p><p class="double">&quot;My beloved subjects, it has been so long.&quot;</p><p class="double">…or so they believed, because the Element of Magic wasn&#039;t activating.</p><p class="double"><i>Please, Element of Magic! Twilight really doesn&#039;t need to deal with Nightmare Moon this loop.</i></p><p class="double">The lack of response from the crown only angered her. &quot;Oh, buck it! Plan B!&quot; And then the Element holders started running towards Nightmare Moon just in time for her usual declaration.</p><p class="double">&quot;The night will last-&quot; … which was as far as she got, because Nightmare Moon&#039;s speech was interrupted by a blur of blue movement which punched her in the jaw.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>OUR</b> NIGHT&quot; Princess Luna said to Nightmare Moon with the full force of the Canterlot Royal Speaking Voice, and blew on her right forehoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess Luna?&quot; all five Element bearers chorused, skidding to a halt in confusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hi!&quot; Luna waved to the Elements bearers, and trotted over as guards covered the recumbent form of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">Once in range, she lowered her voice so only they could hear her. &quot;For some reason I turned up separate to Nightmare Moon this time, any idea why? And where&#039;s Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ohh… my head…&quot; Nightmare Moon said, clutching it. There was a burst of light, and she shrunk down to filly size. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">That filly was…<i>By Harmony.</i> &quot;Dash! Get Twilight NOW.&quot; She only received a Sonic Rainboom as answer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, what&#039;s the deal?&quot; Princess Luna asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s about Nightmare Moon, it could be a very long shot but-&quot; The crack of teleportation interrupted her, bringing Twilight Sparkle and Princess Rainbow Dash. Rarity wondered if there was any library left as of now.</p><p class="double">&quot;We’re here,&quot; Twilight said, bloodshot eyes showing she hadn&#039;t stopped crying after they had left. &quot;What did you want-?&quot;</p><p class="double">She broke off mid sentence, locking eyes with the little alicorn on the dais. &quot;…Nyxie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Momma! I mean, Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna gestured to the two guards to stand down, as Nyx launched herself across the room into Twilight’s forelegs.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened? I was going to bed and then suddenly I was on the moon, and then I tried to play Nightmare Moon when I saw the Summer Sun celebration. Are we in the past?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you… whoever’s organizing this, thank you. For letting me have my daughter back.&quot; Twilight muttered while hugging Nyx tighter.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;…so I won’t be around much?&quot; Nyx asked. &quot;That kinda sucks.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;I know, I wish you would be more but it’s just the way these loops seem to work. But promise me, please let me know the moment you awake in any loop – that&#039;ll be the very next loop for you, but I don’t know how long it will have been for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I promise momma.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the purple unicorn smiled. &quot;But what matters more is that you’re going to be here at all. When I thought I’d lost you…&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Nyx adjusted her glasses. “Hey… next time I turn up, can we play a prank on Princess Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“Whatever you want,” Twilight said. “Whatever you want.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i></p><p class="double"><i>By unexpectedly using a loophole in the &quot;no children&quot; policy for loopers I ended adopting a small filly I named Nyx. I think I could gush for a long time about her, so I&#039;ll leave it for when we meet in person (feel free to ask Princess Luna for pictures, you&#039;ll be for a surprise). The important part is, I found myself heartbroken when the loop reset and I couldn&#039;t even give my farewells to my daughter. However, thank Harmony, Yggdrasil somehow decided to make Nyx awake the very next loop.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I think I now finally understand why you requested me to write you these Looper Reports so many loops ago. I may not know when, I may not know how, but now that both Nyx and myself are looping I know we will meet again someday, in the same way the Looper Reports are a promise for us to meet again. Now I see how those promises give me the strength to go on each day.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Thank you, Princess. For taking care of me even when you aren&#039;t awake.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your faithful student,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Twilight Sparkle</i></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>16.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord snapped his fingers. “Well, so much for the gallant captain of the guard.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor’s coat washed out and became grey, as his Discordification took effect.</p><p class="double">“…wait…” Discord looked over at the Element bearers. “Why aren’t you worried?”</p><p class="double">“Discord?” Twilight said, sniggering. “My brother’s talent is defensive spells. What’s the opposite of defence?”</p><p class="double">The Draconequus started to say something, paused, and then sighed. Snapping his fingers, he created a podium and stepped onto it. “Can I at least have time to pose?”</p><p class="double">“Ooh!” Pinkie hopped up and down. “I know the answer! It’s offense!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shaded her eyes as the Plasma Lancer spell triggered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thanks, Shining.” Cadence said, nuzzling him for a moment. “Just a month to go.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor blushed, then nodded. “Can’t wait.”</p><p class="double">After a moment more, Shining left his fiancée’s rooms and headed home.</p><p class="double">“One month?” A voice said from down the corridor. “Excellent…”</p><p class="double">Cadence looked around. “Who was that?”</p><p class="double">A servant, one who had gone past not five minutes ago doing laundry, flashed green and became a black, insectile alicorn-like creature. “Me. Queen Chrysalis. And I’m sorry to say… <i>little</i> pony… but your wedding isn’t going to go as planned.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis walked forward, green magic glowing around her horn. “Well, in one way in particular. It won’t be you up there with Shining Armor… it’ll be me…”</p><p class="double">Another flash of magic, and Cadence was facing her double.</p><p class="double">The newest princess of Equestria blinked… then grinned. “Excellent!”</p><p class="double">“…what?” Chrysalis nearly tripped over.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hang on, there’s some mistakes with your disguise. That shade isn’t quite the colour of my coat… and that’s the wrong horn spiral curvature… yes, that’s better.” Cadence stepped back and walked around the befuddled Chrysalis. “And I don’t think much of those fetlocks… wait, is my rear really <i>that</i> large? I need to lay off the cakes…”</p><p class="double">“You won’t have <i>any</i> cakes where you’re going!” Chrysalis rejoined, trying to regain the initiative.</p><p class="double">“Well…” Cadence used her magic to lift over a huge pile of paperwork. “Here. I discovered that my aunts were taking on <i>far</i> too much of a load of paperwork, and so I volunteered to help out. Of course, they then each gave me half of theirs, so I’ve ended up overworked myself… honestly, I was letting it pile up a bit… of course, you’ll have to handle that yourself, if you’re going to replace me.”</p><p class="double">Cadence looked over at the faux-alicorn. “Or did you not expect that?”</p><p class="double">“NO!” Chrysalis shouted. “Of course I didn’t! I thought it would be a pleasant month or so in nice surroundings, draining love from your sickeningly devoted fiancé, and then I would invade Equestria!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, no.” Cadence shrugged. “Funny how plans don’t work out, isn’t it… I wanted a quiet wedding.” <i>This time,</i> she thought to herself.</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” she summoned magic to herself, “Bye!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Shining asked, as Cadence materialized in <i>his</i> room.</p><p class="double">“Either she’s left, or she’s going to do all my paperwork. Either way, I think we can get away with a weekend in the mountains.” Cadence grinned. “Twilight was right, this <i>is</i> more satisfying than just kicking her or something.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">If there was one thing that Rainbow Dash had learned through the course of the Time Loops, it was restraint.</p><p class="double">It hadn’t come easy to her, to be certain, but she <i>did</i> manage it now and again.</p><p class="double">But this was one of the Loops Twilight had said she could cut loose on. So that wasn&#039;t a consideration.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dash entered the first stage of her Best Young Fliers’ competition set. Rather than go with something outwardly flashy, she simply executed a series of loops, Immelmann turns and finally five Kulbits in a row.</p><p class="double">Oh, they were well performed, certainly, but nothing to compete with her usual pyrotechnics. But…</p><p class="double">She could already hear it. The pegasi in the audience with an experience of stunt flying were noticing it – her aerobatics were breaking the laws of physics quite thoroughly. Firstly, because she was doing the whole thing in a glide. And given that…</p><p class="double"><i>Heh.</i> Dash felt a grin emerge, as she let the airflow fall off her wings completely. <i>Yeah, I’m stalling. And it doesn’t look like it, does it?</i></p><p class="double">A simple backflip in mid air, and she caught the airstream again. This time, she beat her wings – once only, the first time since she’d started her set. And <i>rocketed</i> forwards.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spitfire gaped. “Soarin’? Is that supposed to be possible?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Soarin’ managed. “She just tripled her speed in one wingbeat.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, good. I did wonder…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Time for something more impressive.</i> Dash stopped abruptly, killing her entire relative velocity in one go and sending her slipstream rocketing upwards into the clouds around. Then, as she began to fall, the blue pegasus accelerated in earnest.</p><p class="double">Again, she was focusing on pure skill. Holding her velocity down to the barest fraction below the speed of sound, a cloud formed around her – not the transient one from breaking the sound barrier, but one that just stayed and stayed.</p><p class="double">It was likely only a few dozen pegasi in the audience would recognize what she was doing – controlling her speed to within a metre per second at the very edge of the sound barrier. But, as her personal weather magic signature interacted with the cloud, it produced a cone of rainbow light all around her.</p><p class="double">Her expert eye gauged the progress of what she’d set in motion overhead. <i>Nearly… nearly…</i></p><p class="double">A wide, sweeping turn took her over a mile away from the stadium. Dropping speed and executing a wingover, she took aim.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…wait…” Soarin’ pointed up. “Should the clouds be doing that?”</p><p class="double">Spitfire followed his hoof. “Wh-no! Of course not!”</p><p class="double">A minute ago, there’d been a scattering of light, fluffy clouds – just enough to make it interesting if the pegasi wanted to use them in their routines. But whatever was going on – was it this Rainbow Dash’s doing? – meant that they were coalescing, and turning an ominous black.</p><p class="double">Actually, it looked like they were about to do a spontaneous lightning discharge.</p><p class="double">“Everypony d-”</p><p class="double">Two huge explosions merged into one, drowning out her voice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dash landed in total silence, the cloud she’d created blown away by the blast.</p><p class="double">“And I call that the Lightning Cutter. Neat, huh?”</p><p class="double">After about five seconds, it finally registered that she’d just used a <i>sonic rainboom</i> to block a <i>lightning bolt</i> in mid air.</p><p class="double"><i>Then</i> the applause started.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sent off the usual letter to Celestia, warning her about the imminent return of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">After a minute or so, she got the reply back – just the same as normal. But the top, as Spike read it out, said:</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Spike,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Please hand this to Twilight without unfolding it. I’m afraid there’s something private I’d like to discuss with her.</i></p><p class="double">“Huh,” Spike said, stopping there. “Wonder what she wants. Secret mission?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, already guessing what the subject was.</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Twilight Sparkle,</i></p><p class="double"><i>As you may have guessed, I’m Awake again. And, sorry to say, I’m feeling a little bit tired. What do you say, should we work out some kind of gigantic prank on Equestria as a whole?</i></p><p class="double">“She wants to see me,” Twilight interpreted to Spike. “I’d better head over there.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight muttered, poring over the notes they’d been making. “So… it looks like the most likely option is number three.”</p><p class="double">Celestia giggled. “Oh, I wish I could see the look on my sister’s face…”</p><p class="double">“I’ll make sure to record it,” Twilight promised. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, basically…” Twilight said to a crowd which included the mayor, two of the other Element bearers and a fair fraction of the town, “The reason the Summer Sun is being held here is because it is closest to the old royal seat, in the Everfree. This has been scheduled for a full thousand years, though,” Twilight shook her head, “it looks like most of the paperwork got lost over the intervening time. Anyway, Princess Celestia is stepping down-”</p><p class="double">There was a sudden hubbub of conversation.</p><p class="double">“Excuse me? Thank you. As I was saying, Princess Celestia is stepping down in favour of her sister, Princess Luna. One of the Royal Sisters has to be in the heavens at all times to maintain the cycle of the years, and the other on Equestria to maintain the cycle of the days. Celestia’s time on Equestria is up, so she’s off to the sun.” Pure invention, but it sounded good. “And that means we need to give a good welcome to Princess Luna. After all, she’s been a little out of touch…”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Mayor Mare gave a determined nod. “Let’s get to work, then!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon stepped out onto stage. “Oh, my beloved subjects-”</p><p class="double">Then she blinked. Banners on the wall saying “goodbye Celestia”, “good luck” and “welcome back Luna”? What was going on?</p><p class="double">Celestia trotted smartly up to her, so brazen that Nightmare found it difficult to react. “Welcome back, Luna. Your job now, I’m off to the sun.”</p><p class="double">And then she vanished. Completely.</p><p class="double">“…what?”</p><p class="double">Then a unicorn came onto the stage. “Welcome back, your highness. Now, we do have a plan of work in place, so let’s start with one of the most important issues – you see, the construction of farming land was given a high priority under your sister’s stewardship, but water conservation and control was rather less rigorously applied. I think a good first place for a tour of inspection would be-”</p><p class="double">“…what is going on?” Nightmare Moon managed.</p><p class="double">“It’s the Precession, of course.” The unicorn smiled tolerantly, and started explaining in the tones of someone saying what everyone already knew. Just for the record, as it were.</p><p class="double">It was all news to Nightmare Moon, but… well, it couldn’t be <i>too</i> bad if she was suddenly in charge.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why are there so many clouds?” Nightmare Moon asked, scowling into the sky. “Can the Pegasi not deal with them?”</p><p class="double">“Not really, no,” Twilight said. “They’re kind of overwhelmed. I mean, sun lamps and hydroponics have worked to provide sufficient food for the population, but a large increase in cloud cover is inevitable when it’s constantly daytime over the largest ocean on the planet.” Twilight conjured a visual aid, spinning the blue-green orb to highlight the huge ocean opposite Equestria itself. “See? The area of daylight is causing mammoth amounts of evaporation.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare sighed. “And would this problem be solved if We made sure it was no longer Eternal Night?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much.” Twilight shrugged. “It’s just climate science, really. And it’s a little hard to admire a night through a thick layer of clouds.”</p><p class="double">“…fine, then.” Nightmare Moon’s horn glowed, and things got perceptibly lighter.</p><p class="double">“It’ll probably take a few months for the climate to settle back down, I’m afraid…” Twilight said. “Still, the pegasi should earn their keep for the duration.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia spun in the air on her magically-reinforced tungsten-diamond surfboard, the photosphere of her star like a warm breeze against her coat. “I never knew this would actually work! Prominences are much more awesome than mere waves!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…and then we used the Elements on Sombra,” Twilight concluded.</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked. “Didn’t I say not to take them? I know it was hard, Twilight, but I had to be <i>certain</i> you weren’t vulnerable to corruption… I won’t repeat my mistake with Luna.” The alicorn of the sun rubbed her temples. “I <i>was</i> keeping an eye on you, scant though that excuse sounds, and…”</p><p class="double">Then she shrugged. “But it apparently doesn’t matter, if you used the Elements anyway. Why <i>did</i> you take them?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, we didn’t <i>take</i> them,” Twilight said innocently. “We summoned them once we’d got there.” Putting action to words, Twilight summoned her Element of Magic to her forehead. “Neat, isn’t it?”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. “It is, actually. But… oh, never mind. Apparently it <i>is</i> impossible to separate you from them then, so a lot of my worries are alleviated.”</p><p class="double">Twilight passed over some papers. “Here – I’ve got Sombra assigned to an anonymous group, to help him recover.”</p><p class="double">The elder ruler scanned what Twilight had given her. “Crystalholics anonymous?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Grar. I am Sombra, and I am obsessed with… crystals.”</p><p class="double">“Hello, Sombra…” chorused four diamond dogs, three teenage dragons, a sea serpent, Pinkie Pie and Discord.</p><p class="double">“Wait.” Sombra pointed at Pinkie. “Pink pony. How?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie sniffed. “I like granulated sugar, okay?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.6 (Stainless Steel Fox) </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Playing Catch-up </u></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Apple Bloom&#039;s underground workshop was pretty much as Flim and Flam had seen it, though that was loops ago. She&#039;d pretty much automated the process of setting it up, letting it run while she went off and did other things. The appeared near on alcove which had a whole lot of racks of herbs and plants, and tables full of brewing equipment. Though Diamond Tiara hardly noticed with all the other incredible things they could see.</p><p class="double">“You built all… this?”</p><p class="double">The farm-pony grinned. &quot;My talent is inventing and making stuff, the more sophisticated the better. That&#039;s why I had so much trouble getting my mark in the base-line reality; most of the things I&#039;m good with don&#039;t exist unless I invent them. And while I&#039;m great at application, I don&#039;t have the spark of genius to make the original breakthroughs. Computer, give me a standard projection display and two bottles of apple juice, no ice.”</p><p class="double">“Working.” A voice came from no-where. A vertical, translucent panel of light appeared in front of them, and a tray came flying over as if brought by unicorn telekinesis. However, it had four whirring ducted fans at the corners which were the probable cause.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve gotta wonder how many blank flanks just never had the opportunity to do whatever their talent was. I <i>can</i> trigger a making and fixing basic stuff cutie-mark now I understand it, but I&#039;d probably never have found my true cutie-mark without the fused loops. Some of them have far higher base tech levels, and I learned everything I could from them.&quot;</p><p class="double">She reached up and touched various pictures on the screen, and it flowed through a succession of cutie-marks, all involving apples and tools or brushes, one an apple cart with a hammer and spanner crossed underneath in the style of a skull and crossbones. It finally settled on her Zap Apple cutie mark, with the bite out of it exposing a golden tracery of circuits and runes.</p><p class="double">“But we’re not here to talk about me. I figured you deserved to know just how awesome <i>you</i> can be. The first one I was thinking of was in a loop where Equestria was being attacked by aliens… I explained about fused loops, didn&#039;t I?&quot; Applebloom checked. At the nod, she continued.</p><p class="double">She pointed to the three versions of Maritech space fighter lined up, one in pega-form. She touched the screen at various points, and it showed a slide show of video clips from that loop, overflying the Marecross, a second cockpit view of a space battle, the three Crusaders, older and with two in uniforms. They were giving each other a three way high hoof.</p><p class="double">“An alien battleship crashed on Equestria in the distant past, and the aliens had come to get it – and wipe out any inconvenient discoverers.” That said with a grimace. “However, the Princesses ordered that it be studied and put back together. It advanced Equestria’s technology, and we worked out how to replace some of the things we couldn’t duplicate with magic. “</p><p class="double">&quot;But that’s just background, I intended to show you what you can be when you aren&#039;t being a jerk… Though in that case you still were, pretty much, but it was for good reason – you know, being an awesome bitch like I said. You two couldn&#039;t pilot, but you tested high for Operations. We were in Red Squadron, me and Scootaloo flying a fighter, and you ended up as our squadron&#039;s Flight Co-ordinator. Sweetie Belle and Silver Spoon were both bridge bunnies,” Applebloom paused, and explained the unfamiliar slang for Diamond, “support operators.”</p><p class="double">&quot;You were an evil minded sadist, a martinet, a drill sergeant who was such a hard ass we joked that was why you had a diamond on your flank… and you brought eleven out of twelve teams in the squadron out the other side. You have to understand, we were hopelessly outnumbered, and most other squadrons suffered better than one hundred percent losses. After we took that Zentran battleship and Scoots made squadron leader, <i>we didn&#039;t lose a single pony</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">She touched more symbols, and a scene appeared. The view from a camera looking down on part of a control room, with Diamond Tiara at a console, flanked by Silver Spoon and Sweetie Belle. “Got the bridge recording after the battle of Ares, it contained some particularly fine examples of Tiara-speak, and it was your birthday coming up…”</p><p class="double">The uniformed Diamond Tiara started speaking. “Red Five, FC. If you hold your formation any looser, you’ll lose your grip completely, if you haven’t already! Tighten up your interval and bring Beta flight round to 16 mark 125, Red Gamma needs support!”</p><p class="double">“FC, Five. On it like a bonnet!” Apple Bloom’s voice came back. </p><p class="double">“FC, Red Eleven, I’m getting my cutie-mark shot off here!” The voice sounded on the edge of panic.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara’s voice cut through it like a knife. “Get that Maritech scratched and it’s coming out of your pay! Use that planetoid at 206 12 as cover and pega-form to shoot them as those pods overfly. Beta’s coming to support you.”</p><p class="double">FC, Eleven, thanks!” the un-named flyer had clearly calmed down.</p><p class="double">The scene continued, Diamond Tiara’s pithy comments not interfering with the way she managed Red squadron like a virtuoso. It was interspersed with take from Mareitech on-board and remote satellite cameras and edited together with an exciting soundtrack. It had the feel of a big budget science-fiction blockbuster, and it served to show Diamond Tiara in the best light as she repeatedly manoeuvred the components of the squadron to evade and destroy the Zentradi pods and mobile suits.</p><p class="double">When the clip ended, Apple Bloom said, “The entire squadron collaborated on making that, Sweetie Belle put together a custom soundtrack , and we showed it to you at your party. I think that was about the only time I’d ever seen you lost for words.</p><p class="double">She grinned, “Though that certainly wasn’t the case after we captured that battleship. I didn’t have fotage for it, but I finally managed to build a memory reader neural interface a few loops ago. So, this one is direct from my memories.”</p><p class="double">A new scene formed, Diamond Tiara was facing Apple Bloom&#039;s viewpoint, wearing a similar uniform to the one they&#039;d seen earlier.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are a pair of idiotic, grandstanding, lunatics!&quot; She yelled, then cracked a tight grin. &quot;However, you are a pair of successful, idiotic grandstanding lunatics, which makes up for it a bit. What were you thinking? Scootaloo, I thought you were better than to get boxed like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was riding heard on the rest of the flight, give me a break!” Scootaloo looked put-upon, but still flushed with excitement. “Some of those rookies are awfully green. I stayed in the fight after one engine got blown out and our avionics harness got hammered, and we covered the rest of the flight until they got to safety. But by that time, that battleship had come up and it could have taken us with its point defence, let alone its main guns.”</p><p class="double">“Huh, they could have hit us with a spit-ball at that range, and that doesn&#039;t count the dozens of escort vessels.” Apple Bloom added. “Even if I&#039;d been able to get the engine back up, we&#039;d still probably been nailed trying to escape.”</p><p class="double">“I read your after action reports. You let a near miss appear to take you out, played dead, though they could have just finished you off anyway. You somehow managed to jury-rig enough computer control to go pega-form with a saddlebag computer, and when they took you on board, bam!” Film-Diamond seemed to realize that she was losing her image, and went back to being coolly detached.</p><p class="double">“They&#039;d never taken prisoners before, and running away was certain death. To be honest, neither Scoots or I figured what we were doing would be any different, but we reckoned we could take more of them with us.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara growled. “You do or die types give me an acute pain in the rump! You realise how much trouble I&#039;m going to have try and get the rest of that space happy crew of reprobates in Red Squadron not to try and pull a similar stunt! You had the Princesses’ own luck that you somehow managed to take them off guard, and when you did get blasted, you ended up being blown into one of the machine spaces.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom appeared to shrug. “We were working towards it. Zentran tech is either &#039;use until it stops working&#039; or self-repairing. We figured no-pony would look for us in the machine spaces. Plus, they may be armoured and secured to Tartarus on the outside, but they&#039;ve never needed internal computer security. Though even I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d be able to crack them that easily. But the engineering forums are right, they don&#039;t innovate either. The same programs we used to interface with the Marecross&#039;s thousand year old original systems worked just as well for that one.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo chuckled. “Oh, man, it was fun to see the havoc when she faked a power core overload and triggered an abandon ship. And scrambling the IFF files so the main guns started seeing everything over the size of a shuttle as an enemy… It was beautiful!”</p><p class="double">You could hear Apple Bloom’s appreciation in her voice. “Scootaloo gets props too. She got that hulk moving with the controls I jury-rigged from our Maritech and flew it pretty much blind all the way back.”</p><p class="double">“If you keep patting yourselves on the back like that you&#039;ll hurt your fore-leg… or <i>I</i> will.” Diamond Tiara sniffed. “I guess I&#039;d be just as mad either way. If you&#039;d gotten your fool selves blown to atoms, it would have blotted my record. I guess having to ride herd on your fellow flying circus rejects to stop them from pulling something similarly insane is the lesser of two evils.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom chuckled. “We love you too DT!”</p><p class="double">There was another growl. “Gahhh! Don&#039;t call me DT, it&#039;s Flight Controller or ma&#039;am! Well, despite the fact that you both look and smell as if you&#039;ve spent a week on the waste reclamation level, you are in very good odour with the top brass. There was mention of medals, but we&#039;ll have to see exactly what comes of that, if anything.”</p><p class="double">She gave an evil grin, her composure restored. “However, I can tell you that they&#039;re detaching a prize crew to send that hulk you captured back to Equestria for refitting, and your good friend Rainbow Dash is getting bumped to Wing Commander and is in charge of the oversize squadron they&#039;re sending with it for fighter cover. That means the squadron leader slot of Rainbow Squadron is up for grabs…”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was practically hovering in mid-air in excitement as she continued. “…and will go to Lightning Dust. But it means that Squadron Leader Soarin is going to move into Rainbow, and <i>that</i> means you are the new biggest noise in Red Squadron, Squadron Leader Scootaloo and Senior Flight Engineer Apple Bloom. And may the Princess have mercy on our souls.”</p><p class="double">She sighed over-theatrically at the pegasus, who had a grin that would probably take surgical intervention to remove. “What did I do to deserve this? A poor innocent pony like myself, saddled with two of the biggest ding dongs in the whole of the MDF.”</p><p class="double">“I dunno. Just lucky, I guess.” Scootaloo grinned.</p><p class="double">The scene ended with Apple Bloom sporting a distant look and a big grin. “You&#039;d have sooner walked the length of the Marecross&#039;s main deck without an pressure harness, but you did care for us, all of us, and we would have flown straight into Tartarus at your instruction because we knew you&#039;d never ask us to do anything if it wasn&#039;t in the best way to protect every-pony.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.7 (Stainless Steel Fox) </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Alert: the previous part of Turning the Tables – located in chapter eight – has been edited somewhat, to better show what Celestia’s intentions as opposed to her results were.) </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u><b>Turning Tables (Continued)</b></u> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">If Twilight had been privy to her mentor&#039;s thoughts she&#039;d have probably thrown in the towel right then, considering her mission accomplished. In fact, she&#039;d have probably felt a bit guilty at the way Celestia had worried about her. She might disagree with how her mentor had handled the Nightmare Moon situation in the base-line loop, but that didn&#039;t mean she didn&#039;t care for her deeply.</p><p class="double">As she stepped up to the ticket booth at Canterlot station, she reflected on the irony of what she was about to do. Celestia&#039;s horn-off approach would actually work for this version of Twilight, who was certain she could solve the Nightmare Moon crisis without any assistance from the Princess. In fact, she was looking forward to the challenge of rekindling her old friendships without the framing device of being the overseer for the Midsummer Sun Festival, and doing it while staying under Princess Celestia&#039;s radar.</p><p class="double">“Single to Manehatten, please.” She horned over the bits to the counter-pony, schooling her expression to be slightly sad. This was another false trail she was laying. If her estimates were correct, Princess Celestia and her brother would assume a life-long Canterlot native such as herself, and one who&#039;d spent a lot of time in libraries at that, to stay in Canterlot. Saying in her letter that she couldn&#039;t stay at her parent&#039;s house would imply that she was looking to stay somewhere else in Canterlot.</p><p class="double">So the Princess&#039;s first response would probably to go through Canterlot with a fine tooth comb before checking the station or air-ship port. When they did, they&#039;d discover she&#039;d gotten a ticket to the far end of the line, and start looking for her there, rather than Ponyville. To further muddy the waters, she had no intention of letting any-pony see her get off there. Teleportation from a moving vehicle wasn&#039;t easy, but it <i>was</i> possible if you had as much experience as Twilight did.</p><p class="double">Eager to be about it, she left the carriage and got out of sight of any-pony inside as soon as they were well clear of the station. First some changes, her horn glowed as she wrapped an illusion around herself that would take an alicorn to pierce. Her coat became a washed out blue, her mane white and tied back in a bun, and her cutie-mark, an open book with a red bookmark in it. Her saddlebags changed too, actually being changed into a simpler, less expensive design, and a pair of manifested pince-nez glasses completed the disguise.</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed again and she and flashed away and reappeared a few hooves in the air on the outskirts of Ponyville, near the road from Canterlot. A double check to see she hadn&#039;t kept any of the trains’ velocity, and that she&#039;d not been seen, and her horn flared and lowered her to the ground. Walking into town she headed straight for the mayor&#039;s office.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“These credentials are very impressive, Miss Codex.” The mayor examined the paperwork in front of her. “With these you could certainly get a job in any library or archive in one of the big cities. May I ask why you chose to come to Ponyville?”</p><p class="double">Twilight, now Codex, knew the question was just for form&#039;s sake. The old librarian, Flower Dew, had been offered a job in the Royal Canterlot Archives, which not only paid better but had put her far closer to her grand-children in Canterlot. Twilight suspected Princess Celestia&#039;s horn in that. As a result, the Mayor had been keeping Golden Oaks open ad hoc, whenever she could find a pony with a few hours to spare.</p><p class="double">Since none of them were trained in Library Science, the books were in a terrible mix up, put back wherever the pony in charge thought they should go. It was one of the reasons Twilight had found it so hard to find the reference guide. It should not have been in the popular fiction section, under E. The upshot was that the mayor was ready to hire just about any-pony, or a griffon or Diamond Dog for that matter, if they could show they could do the job.</p><p class="double">She showed none of these thoughts and instead gave a sigh. “Big cities, and all the things that come with them, are exactly what I&#039;m trying to get away from. I have personal reasons for wanting to find somewhere quiet to think things over and put my life back…”</p><p class="double">She stopped herself as if she&#039;d said more than she intended. “Can we leave it at that? I&#039;d rather not talk about it. I can do the job, if you want me too.”</p><p class="double">The mayor was a softy at heart, Twilight had worked with her long enough to know how she&#039;d react. She felt a bit guilty at taking advantage of the other mare&#039;s good nature, but she could do the job, and although her references were faked, they were actually less impressive than her real ones. The mayor would eventually send off to the archives and to get statements from her referees and find out the deception, but that wouldn&#039;t be until after the Summer Sun celebration, which was all the time Twilight needed.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure we can use you on a trial basis. Some-pony from Canterlot is coming to oversee the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration, and the Princess has requested she stay at Golden Oaks, but if you don&#039;t mind giving up your room for the night…”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “I&#039;m sure I can sleep on a cot for one night. I&#039;ll wait until after the Midsummer Sun Celebration to get unpacked. In the mean time, if she&#039;s interested in books, I should be there to help her find what she needs.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” The mayor smiled back at her. “That kind of attitude is exactly what we need!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight spent a couple of happy hours re-shelving and cataloguing the misfiled books and getting the place spick and span. When you knew the vast number of household charms she did, and had lived in the place for centuries, you knew exactly what needed doing. Then her stomach rumbled, indicating that teatime was fast approaching.</p><p class="double">She decided to head for Sugarcube Corner over Sweet Apple Acres, as she&#039;d be able to get in groceries in town as well as some delicious cakes for tea. She knew that Pinkie would have been working at the counter when she first arrived, which explained the lack of an encounter, but she wasn&#039;t sure if she still would be by now.</p><p class="double">“Hello, welcome to Sugar Cube – Wow! I&#039;ve never seen you before!”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled at the hyperactive pink pony behind the counter. “That&#039;s probably because I just got into town today.”</p><p class="double">“That would be why! Gosh you&#039;re smart! I&#039;m Pinkie Pie!”</p><p class="double">“And I&#039;m hungry. But my name&#039;s Codex. I&#039;m the new town librarian.” Twilight was basking in the banter. If there was ever a pony to lift your spirits it was Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">“Ohhh! Codex the Librarian? Do you slay mighty Thesauruses with a single strike of your due-date stamp?” Pinkie&#039;s manner made it clear she wasn&#039;t mocking, just being her usual random self.</p><p class="double">Twilight rubbed the back of her head with a hoof, playing along. “Well I have dealt with some fairly nasty Grimoires, even a few Incunabula. But my mind is sharp, my indexing skills intact, my heart is pure. And my knowledge of the Pony-decimal indexing system is encyclopaedic. Is this your shop? I mean with a name like Pie…”</p><p class="double">“Oh no silly,” the pink pony giggled, “Just because I&#039;m called Pinkie Pie, doesn&#039;t mean I own a bakery. No, the Cakes own Sugar Cube Corner, I just live here. So now we know each other, we&#039;re friends. Welcome to Ponyville, my newest best friend Codex.”</p><p class="double">At that, Twilight let her expression grow more wistful. Time to play her in-loop role. “Friends? Just like that? I shouldn&#039;t… but I guess it doesn&#039;t matter any more.”</p><p class="double">She gave a deep sigh. “I&#039;d like that. I had to leave my friends behind when I left.”</p><p class="double">“Aww! It&#039;s okay, you can make new friends here! I can help, I know every pony in Ponyville, and all the cows and donkeys and mules and everyone else. It&#039;ll be easy, I mean, I&#039;m your friend, and we&#039;ve only just met…” the pink pony&#039;s brow furrowed in thought, “… though it seems like I&#039;ve known you for a long time.”</p><p class="double">That had Twilight confused. Was Pinkie&#039;s Pinkie sense, or one of the other reality bending talents that she regularly displayed letting her sense the loops? She covered it with a grin. “Well I&#039;m glad to meet you, Pinkie Pie. Could I have half a dozen of your pineapple perfect muffins please?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s eyes widened. “Golly, you&#039;re even smarter than I thought! I only just invented them today! I hadn&#039;t even put them out for ponies to try yet.”</p><p class="double">She hoofed over a half dozen delightful looking muffins as Twilight mentally kicked herself. “Uh… Mysterious Librarian Powers. You have to be able to sense hidden cake to stop people leaving crumbs or icing on the pages when they&#039;re browsing.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie gave her a long stare, then exclaimed. “Okie Dokie Lokie! Since you&#039;re new in town, have them on the house, or rather the shop.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll need a long ladder then. Sorry, I mean that&#039;s very generous.”</p><p class="double">Fortunately Pinkie liked the joke and chuckled. “You&#039;re a lot more fun than our last librarian.”</p><p class="double">“Um… I read a lot of joke books? Speaking of books, I&#039;ve still got a ton of work to do getting the library sorted out before I go to bed.”</p><p class="double">Twilight went away with a smile on her face and a song in her heart. Admittedly making friends with Pinkie was hardly a great feat, but to be honest, this was a far better first meeting than her original one. She was considering how to set up similar meetings with her other friends, and didn&#039;t notice when someone came around a corner.</p><p class="double">She and a white coated unicorn ended up sprawled on the ground, but her telekinesis grabbed her bags of groceries, her muffins, and the bundle Rarity had been carrying before they hit the ground. Okay, maybe there was some force drawing her to the other elements. She reacted pretty much as she would have anyway.</p><p class="double">“Oh my gosh! I&#039;m sorry! I wasn&#039;t looking where I was going!” Twilight sprung to her hooves and offered a hoof up. Her bun was undone and white mane hair was straggling out.</p><p class="double">“No harm done, I should have been more careful myself.” The unicorn used the proffered hoof to help herself up and dusted herself off with deft flicks of telekinesis. “Thank you for saving my new design. If it had ended up in the dirt, it would have been ruined. And I made is especially for the Summer Sun Celebration.”</p><p class="double">“Glad I could help.” Twilight had always wondered why Rarity had shown up to the Celebration without a dress, maybe in the base line she&#039;d run into some-pony else with slower reflexes.</p><p class="double">“Oh, my dear, aren&#039;t you straining to carry all that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight realised that she was still holding up the various items, a tricky load for most unicorns, without showing visible effort. She moved her groceries back into her saddlebags, the box of muffins back onto her saddle, and proffered the dress to Rarity. “It&#039;s alright, I&#039;m a librarian, I&#039;ve had a lot of practice. Books are heavy.”</p><p class="double">“Oh? What&#039;s a librarian doing in Ponyville?” The white unicorn laid the bundle gently across her own saddle.</p><p class="double">“Running a library… I hope.” Twilight quipped. “I&#039;m taking over Golden Oaks, I just got into town today. I&#039;m Codex, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“My goodness, where are my manners? I am Rarity, fashonista and proprietor of Carousel Boutique.“</p><p class="double">“Pleased to meet you.” Twilight held out a hoof, which still had dirt on it. “Oh… sorry!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, come my dear, we must get you cleaned up after your little mishap…” Rarity turned around and started leading her towards the boutique. Despite the fact that this was perfect, Twilight felt she had to play her role.</p><p class="double">She shook her head and hung back. “Please, you don&#039;t need to…”</p><p class="double">“Nonsense, it&#039;s the least I can do for saving my dress.” Rarity&#039;s tone brooked no argument, so Twilight reluctantly allowed herself to be led exactly where she wanted to go. As she expected, the quick clean-up turned into an impromptu dressing up session, as Rarity politely interrogated her. “So, darling, where exactly did you come from?”</p><p class="double">Twilight had considered this, and decided it couldn&#039;t hurt to stick to the truth. Besides she knew how Rarity would react. “Sugar Cube Corner, but if you&#039;re asking where I lived before I came to Ponyville… Canterlot.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Canterlot</i>?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can&#039;t wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I… <i>Rubies</i> ?! What <i>was</i> I thinking? Let me get you some sapphires!”</p><p class="double">Twilight wanted to see how this would have played out if she hadn&#039;t run away. “Wait! I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;m not some fashionable society mare. I spend all my time in libraries, reading about stuff other ponies have done. I never really went out and did anything myself. This is the first time I&#039;ve ever left Canterlot.”</p><p class="double">It was completely true for her in-loop self. She hung her head. “I&#039;d like to be friends, but I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;m not what you hoped for…”</p><p class="double">However, Rarity came through with flying colours as she&#039;d expected. “Oh don&#039;t be silly my dear, you coming from Canterlot is merely the icing on the cake, so to speak. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll still be great friends. I love a good romance, or a mystery. Or even the occasional adventure novel.”</p><p class="double">Twilight didn&#039;t have to fake the big smile that brought to her face. “Do you like Daring Doo?”</p><p class="double">She knew the answer to that; Rainbow Dash wasn&#039;t the only pony to be taken with the exploits of the pegasus professor of ponylithic puzzles. However, she wasn&#039;t that vocal about it. Rarity blushed. “I have to admit, I&#039;ve read a tale or two. Not the most refined of ponies, but who can not love the way she finds lost treasures and beautiful magical gems.”</p><p class="double">“Now wait a second, what about the scene in The Griffon&#039;s Goblet where she has to get into the Griffon Ambassador&#039;s party to get a rubbing of the map on the ancient shield?” Twilight replied, showing her credentials as a Daring reader quite handily. “She may not be an elegant society pony normally, but she can pull it off when she has to…”</p><p class="double">Twilight headed back to the library as night came and the moon rose. The discussion had carried on for long enough that Rarity had insisted on making dinner for them both. Twilight, or rather Codex had offered the muffins as dessert. They&#039;d chatted about Daring Doo and other stories Rarity liked, and Twilight had even kicked in some gossip from Canterlot, the sort of things any-pony might know. Once again she&#039;d hinted that something bad had happened to her while avoiding talking about it directly.</p><p class="double">As with Pinkie this new first meeting with Rarity had been a lot more successful then the original one, and the burgeoning friendship far more solidly based. She took a deep breath of the fragrant night air and looked up at the mare shadow on the surface of the moon. She might not be doing it the usual way, but by Celestia, Twilight was still going to defeat the Nightmare and free Luna, one way or another. She wondered how her mentor was doing. Hopefully she wasn&#039;t taking the derailment of her plans too hard.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Your highness!” Shining Armour came galloping up to the Princess&#039;s chambers at an unseemly rate, only to find the Princess Celestia poring over a stack of papers and ancient tomes, and looking decidedly frazzled. “I have news of my sister!”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve found her?” Shining was shocked at the naked relief in Celestia&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid not. But I do know why. She bought a one way ticket to Manehatten at the railway station early this afternoon. I&#039;m sorry your highness, I never even considered that Twily might leave Canterlot, I mean she&#039;s lived here all her life…”</p><p class="double">He stopped as Celestia waved a hoof at him. “It isn&#039;t your fault, neither did I. It seems my student continues to surprise me with her actions. I assume you&#039;ve already sent pegasi out after the train?”</p><p class="double">“The fastest in the Royal Guard, a flying chariot and escort. Unfortunately, they may not reach the train until it reaches Manehatten. I impressed on them the need for speed, but if Twily is trying to lose herself, then there would be no better place than Manehatten to do it.”</p><p class="double">“Assemble a second team, Captain… Shining Armour. I will personally flash them there.”</p><p class="double">That knocked Twilight&#039;s brother back on his fetlocks. Princess Celestia&#039;s flash teleport ability was often talked about, but she almost never actually used it, much less carried others with her. With it, she could travel the length of Equestria in seconds.</p><p class="double">“Yes your highness, at once…” he hesitated. “Forgive me, bit why is it so important that we find her right away? I&#039;m sure we can track her down in a few days, even in Manehatten. For that matter, I&#039;m sure she&#039;ll eventually contact our parents or myself once she&#039;s settled down. I know how she gets sometimes, but she&#039;ll calm down.”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia sighed, and reached a decision. Time to make good on her vow to be more open about what was going on. Telling her brother would serve as practice for when she found Twilight.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid we do not have time.” The princess indicated one of the cushions in the room. “I have to tell you a story of something that happened long ago, and the part Twilight was… <i>is</i> to play in righting it. Once upon a time, in this land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together, and created harmony for all the land…”</p><p class="double">She explained the history of herself and her sister, throwing in some elements that she hadn&#039;t been sure of when she wrote the original legend. Centuries of research showed that there had been something more than just her sister making up Nightmare Moon, a darker essence that had twisted her sister from simply disgruntled into world ending monster.</p><p class="double">Then came the hard bit, explaining about the Elements of Harmony, and how his sister and five other as yet unknown ponies were apart of them. She even discussed her original reasoning as to why she&#039;d handled things the way she had, and how she&#039;d later realised her mistakes. By the end of it Philomena had flown over and was sitting on her shoulder, nestling into her mane, and crooning softly.</p><p class="double">At the end, Shining Armour sat very quietly. It wasn&#039;t every day that you heard the confessions of a goddess. “You&#039;ve given me a lot to think about…”</p><p class="double">Celestia shook her head, getting a startled squawk from Philomena. &quot;I wouldn&#039;t have asked of you or any of your troops what I&#039;ve expected of Twilight, not without their full and informed consent at least. I&#039;m… sorry, truly sorry, can you believe that at all times I wanted what was best for Twilight, that the last thing I wanted was for her to get hurt…&quot;</p><p class="double">She stopped herself. “Only the full power of the Elements can free my sister from that Nightmare, and only Twilight can properly reawaken the Elements and use their full power. I was so focussed on preparing her for that, that I forgot that there were other important things she needed to learn. I was at least as close to Luna as you are to Twilight, wouldn&#039;t you do anything to free your sister in a similar situation?” By the end she was all but pleading in tone.</p><p class="double">“I… you don&#039;t have to justify yourself to me, your highness,” Shining said quietly. “I am sworn to your service, to give my life to protect you if need be, and I know Twilight is at least as devoted to you.”</p><p class="double">Celestia gave a rueful smile. “That actually makes me feel worse. It only confirms that if I had started out being open with Twilight about what I needed her to do, she would have instantly volunteered. Hopefully I will still have time to do that, but if I don&#039;t, I need you to be at the Summer Sun Celebration.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, I will protect you…”</p><p class="double">“NO!” Celestia was edging on using her Royal Canterlot voice, and Shining Armour&#039;s mane was blown backwards from the force of it. “Whatever you do, do not interfere! Empowered by the conjunction, my sister will be too powerful for me to defeat. Your defensive spells are without peer, but defence will not win this battle and free my sister. She has to capture me, so I can force her to divert most of her power into restraining me, and trapping me in the sun. That will give Twilight the chance to collect the Elements from the Palace and activate them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Princess, won&#039;t that hurt you?&quot;</p><p class="double">“Consider it the contribution of a foolish old mare to the task of defeating Nightmare Moon and freeing my sister. The bearers of the Elements are in Ponyville, and it&#039;s my hope that wherever Twilight is, when she learns what has transpired she will come to find out for herself. You must pass on this knowledge in my stead. If there is any-pony in Equestria that Twilight will trust, it is you. Tell her everything, tell her I do believe in her, that she can do this, tell her…. I&#039;m sorry.”</p><p class="double">“I will… I will prepare a recovery team at once.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour bowed his head, and rose up from his cushion to take his leave, leaving the immortal alicorn princess alone with her thoughts, and her regrets.</p><p class="double">“Princess Celestia?” The voice was Perriwig, her seneschal. “I apologise for disturbing you at this late hour, but there is the matter of a replacement overseer for the Summer Sun Celebrations. Who do I send in Twilight Sparkle&#039;s stead?”</p><p class="double">The Princess sighed, the appointment was unimportant now that she couldn&#039;t use it to send Twilight Sparkle to Ponyville. However, she still had to find some-pony, or rather make sure some-pony was found. “Use your best judgement. I trust you will find some-pony suitable.”</p><p class="double">“As you command, your highness.” he bowed and retreated. As he did he considered the choices. It should be some-pony of sufficient importance that the inhabitants of Ponyville wouldn&#039;t feel slighted. He&#039;d thought Twilight Sparkle a poor choice anyway, while she might be close to Celestia and a good organiser she had little official standing…</p><p class="double">Of course, he had the perfect candidate. He&#039;d overseen the Celebration last year in Canterlot, and was a suitably important pony for the purpose. With a sense of purpose, he headed off to organise things. Whatever distress the Princess might be feeling over Twilight Sparkle&#039;s disappearance, at least this was one thing she wouldn&#039;t need to worry about. The Summer Sun Celebrations in Ponyville would go off without a hitch.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.8</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Huh. Human again.” Twilight scanned through her memories. Nothing particular, just that she’d recently moved house. </p><p class="double">That made her feel uncomfortable. Loops almost always had <i>something</i> going on. And when the other (horse)shoe didn’t drop for a while, that usually meant it was something big.</p><p class="double">Twilight would never forget the time Pinkie Pie materialized in front of her, warp goddess of the Eldar Empire.</p><p class="double">“Wait…” A horrible suspicion dawned on her. Something Spike had teased her about for weeks.</p><p class="double">She reached into her subspace pocket and pulled out a PADD, scrolling through the gathered fiction of the Hub Loop to find what she was after.</p><p class="double">“Yep. Thought so.”</p><p class="double">Twilight put the PADD down next to her and sighed. “I’m replacing <i>Bella Swan</i>. Oh, I wish I had <i>TMS Harmony</i> with me…” Right now, the dreadnought class ship would be a great equalizer. Sadly, it was a little big for her to easily fit in her subspace pocket – even now, let alone when she’d been in that Loop.</p><p class="double">After a bit of feeling sorry for herself, she got a determined expression and stood back up. “Right. Where did I put that wand…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There was nothing quite so satisfying as letting a Loop sort itself out. Well, <i>almost</i> sort itself out.</p><p class="double">“Right. And what happened next?” the assistant chief asked, flipping onto the third page of his notes.</p><p class="double">“Well – I don’t know if he actually did,” Twilight said, shuddering, “but he told me that he was sneaking into my room and watching me sleep.”</p><p class="double">“Right…”</p><p class="double">“And that’s when I asked dad to handle it. I mean, he’d been worried before, but I thought it was just… nerves, you know? And he hadn’t done anything <i>really</i> creepy until then, but looking back…” The girl shrugged helplessly.</p><p class="double">“Thank you for your time, miss Sparkle.” The police officer closed his notebook. “I’m afraid this might go to court, but we’ll try to keep the disruption in your life minimal.”</p><p class="double">“I appreciate it,” Twilight said. “I’d just like everything to go back to normal, really.”</p><p class="double">That, at least, was true. A chance for several uninterrupted years of schooling in a nuclear-tech level world? Excellent!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“But you <i>can’t</i> arrest me!” Edward Cullen shouted. “My father will sort this out! He’s done it before!”</p><p class="double">“He has, has he?” Charlie Sparkle said, frowning. “And I thought he was such a nice man.”</p><p class="double">Edward thrashed at the handcuffs, which unaccountably failed to break.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight grinned inside. There were no better targets for Mordenkainen’s Disjunction than the Cullens, in her opinion.</p><p class="double">And now the justice system could handle them <i>quite</i> nicely.</p><p class="double">“Right, where did I put that physics textbook…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.9</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You know what,” Dash said suddenly, “buck it. Gilda, you take my slot.”</p><p class="double">The griffin blinked. “Dash… this… what? I mean, <i>what?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Seems fairly simple, Gilda.” Dash grinned. “You take my slot in the Best Young Fliers. You deserve a chance.”</p><p class="double">“But…” Gilda’s beak opened and closed. She was at a loss for words for almost ten seconds, until she finally came up with something to say. “Dash… don’t do this! I mean, you’ve wanted to do well at the Best Young Fliers for years!”</p><p class="double">“So have you, you told me as much training last week.” Dash shrugged. Then she caught Gilda’s eye, and winked. “Besides, I think I’m <i>easily</i> awesome enough to get the attention of the Wonderbolts anyway. It isn’t as if a broken down old hen like you is going to have a chance!”</p><p class="double">Gilda’s eyes widened, and her ruff rose. “Did you just call me a <i>broken down old hen</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Dash drew out the word, now looking sly. “You <i>could</i> always prove me wrong.”</p><p class="double">The griffin seethed. “You bet I will, Dash! You’ll eat those words!” Suddenly, she laughed. “Well, I’m good and motivated now! I didn’t think you ponies could be that devious!”</p><p class="double">Dash gave her a fierce grin. “Hey, we haven’t been invaded in decades. Why do you think?” Dash gestured skywards. “Make me proud, Gils.”</p><p class="double">Gilda shot into the air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Huh…” Dash said, squinting up. “Don’t remember seeing any pegasus use the clouds like that.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. Gilda was darting from cloud to cloud such that only a few ponies were able to properly follow her movement. To the rest of them, it looked like she was entering one cloud and then appearing from a completely different one seconds later.</p><p class="double">She was definitely getting the full benefit from joining Dash’s exhausting training regimen over the last few months, that was for sure.</p><p class="double">Then the griffin started simply gliding. Most pegasi made use of thermals, but Gilda was clearly a master of the art – even spinning her own thermals with minute movements of her wings that resonated in the air.</p><p class="double">“Hey, I think she’s impressed Spitfire,” Twilight suddenly said, pointing with a nod of her head. “Think they’ll have to redesign the Wonderbolt outfit?”</p><p class="double">Gilda had entered a dive while they weren’t watching. Now she stooped on the main stage at well over half the speed of sound, flaring her wings to cancel her momentum perfectly on the floor itself.</p><p class="double">Her landing was light as a feather.</p><p class="double">“Interesting,” Twilight said as they applauded. “I like the combination of poise and grace, there…”</p><p class="double">“<i>I’m</i> wondering if I should get her to try for the Rainboom,” Dash replied. “She was getting pretty fast there.”</p><p class="double">“Could be interesting. Let me know if you need help with that,” Twilight said contemplatively. “I know a fair amount about pegasus magic theory, though you’re second to none at the practical side.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">16.10</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna stumbled.</p><p class="double">She was… <i>Luna</i>, again. Why? What had caused the burning rage, which had enveloped her for the last thousand years, to so abruptly dissipate?</p><p class="double">Accepting there wouldn’t be a quick answer, the Princess of the Night prepared to dream-walk – nothing major, just to observe. If she was to return, it had best be with a full understanding of how culture had developed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Nice to see you, Nyxie.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks, momma!” Nyx returned the grin. “Hey, I came up with a great idea for a joke to play on Celestia!”</p><p class="double">The unicorn listened carefully, occasionally offering corrections or asking questions.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I have come across a young filly who I think would be an excellent applicant to your academy. While I understand that normally those wishing to attend are sponsored by their parents, in this case I feel that I must strongly recommend her attendance on my own authority – such as it is and what there is of it, of course.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your faithful student,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Twilight Sparkle.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Twilight looked up as Spike burped up a scroll. “Is that the reply?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” Spike skimmed through it. “Basically, yes. She’s scheduled an exam for this afternoon.”</p><p class="double">“Yay!” Nyx said, bouncing around. “Thank you, Twilight!”</p><p class="double">“You deserve it,” Twilight said, smiling down at the overexcited filly. It was true enough – while Nyx didn’t have access to quite the power of an adult alicorn, she still had a <i>lot</i> of magic at her disposal. And since she’d once turned Fluttershy into a tree…</p><p class="double">And, just to make a point of sorts, Twilight had given her a cosmic spectrum crystal pendant to wear. It looked good on her, too…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright,” Celestia said, entering the examination room. Since there was no need to bring parents along and since classes were in session, the room was nearly empty – she’d decided to attend personally, because that way she could also see how Twilight was doing.</p><p class="double">Then she blinked. “…what?”</p><p class="double">“Hi!” the <i>alicorn</i> filly said, running over. “Are you Princess Celestia? Oh, sorry, that’s a stupid question, of course you are! My name’s Nyx!”</p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Celestia asked, “…where did you say you found her?”</p><p class="double">“I didn’t, actually…” Twilight shrugged. “What’s the first part of the test?”</p><p class="double">Now seriously wrong-hoofed, Celestia answered without thinking about it. “Conjuration.”</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Nyx said, concentrating. Her horn glowed, and her wings half-spread with the effort…</p><p class="double">And, with a cloud of smoke, Princess Luna fell to the floor in a tangle of limbs.</p><p class="double">“…oops,” Nyx blushed. “Who’s she? I think I messed up…”</p><p class="double">Celestia’s eyes darted from Nyx, to her Cosmic Spectrum pendant, then to her sister. “…pass, full marks.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. She knew what Celestia would be guessing thanks to the presence of the pendant – Nyx had somehow ascended beforehand by way of her pendant, clearly wasn’t evil because the stone would show up the presence of evil, and therefore this <i>was</i> an accident. “Hear that, Nyx?”</p><p class="double">“Yay!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>17.1</p><p class="double">Rarity passed Spike another gemstone. “Can you round this one off?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Spike carefully whetted the ruby with his claws, slicing off the cornered edges and following that up by rolling it around in his paws. “There you go; that should be fine.”</p><p class="double">She plucked it from his hands without looking, and slotted it carefully into a recess in the outfit she was designing. “Right, that should do…” Needle and thread worked, sealing over the recess so that the gem was concealed beneath a thin layer of silk.</p><p class="double">“So, what are you going for?” Spike asked, drilling a hole through a sapphire with his claw.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Rarity said, “I’m trying to make something to work as Applejack’s semi-permanent coronation dress. Something for her to default to, if you see what I mean.” She caught sight of the blue stone, and winced. “Oh, dear, did I give you a sapphire? Oops – that should have been an emerald, since I’m trying to stick to apple-related colours.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Right – I’ll try to remember that myself. Can I…?”</p><p class="double">“Go ahead.”</p><p class="double">The dragon popped said sapphire into his mouth, shattering it with his teeth and swallowing. “Delicious. So, why are the gems not so apparent?”</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>you</i> know Applejack…” Rarity moved her work light over the outfit. “The gems aren’t immediately visible, but they still colour the silk over them. It’s to represent how her country-girl nature is still her foundation – as the silk is foundation to the dress – but it conceals refinement within.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, I see.” Spike frowned. “Wouldn’t cotton work better? I mean, it <i>is</i> a plant, and silk thread is animal based and usually associated with wealth itself…”</p><p class="double">“…drat.” Rarity rolled her eyes, and the dress flew apart in a burst of telekinesis. Cotton snaked in and started to reassemble the base frame. “Well spotted… I can’t believe I missed that.”</p><p class="double">Spike started in alarm. “Won’t that wreck all the work you’ve done so far?”</p><p class="double">“Not really, no…” the unicorn assured him, still focusing on her work. “A lot of what I do is… building the image in my mind as I build the dress itself. Since I’ve already got a fair way into the process, I can just reconstruct what I’ve already done.”</p><p class="double">Her horn glow died down. “There. See?”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Very impressive. Oh – what did you want next?”</p><p class="double">“Peridot, please,” Rarity said, frowning at the area of the spine. “And then some topaz.”</p><p class="double">“…there are yellow apples?”</p><p class="double">“I admit,” Rarity shrugged, “Applejack doesn’t seem to grow many. But they do exist – from a different part of her family, but it’s there. Now, how do I handle the wings…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There we go,” Rarity said eventually, “I think it looks fairly good.”</p><p class="double">Spike evaluated the dress. It looked fairly simple, mostly white, but with more than enough trimmings in orange to keep it from being considered a bridal dress. But when the light hit it, it shimmered green-red-orange-yellow. In fact, the way the colours of the smaller gems moderated the larger ones, it had the rough complexion of an apple as well.</p><p class="double">The wings were properly accommodated for, as well – an ingenious fold in the fabric on each side concealed holes, and when extended the wings would be able to beat without stretching the dress too much.</p><p class="double">On the other hand, there were so many gemstones in it that it could probably deflect crossbow bolts, entirely separate from the enchantments woven into it. That made flying a chancy prospect for anyone who <i>wasn’t</i> either an alicorn or Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">“Interesting, certainly…” he said diplomatically. “I’m just afraid that AJ might consider it too frou-frou for her.”</p><p class="double">“You aren’t suggesting that my dresses are too frou-frou, are you Spike?” Rarity asked, with a pleading note in her town that was almost entirely feigned.</p><p class="double">“No, no,” Spike assured her. “A hypothetical Applejack is suggesting that.”</p><p class="double">“Well, so long as it’s only a hypothetical one, then I’ll endure it quite well,” Rarity said tartly. “I might test her reaction to a lesser version of this – one without the wing holes – though I’ll probably need your help for that one as well.”</p><p class="double">“No problem,” Spike said. “Same time next week?”</p><p class="double">“Alright, then,” Rarity replied. “It’s a- time.”</p><p class="double">Neither of them commented on what she’d nearly said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, how’d it go?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Alright,” Spike said, shrugging. “I helped her make a dress – very gemstone heavy. Learned quite a lot about how gemstones hold enchantments, too, which was interesting.” Then he grinned. “And I don’t think I’ll need dinner tonight, either – shaved crystals.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.”</p><p class="double">“What are you working on, by the way?” Spike asked, looking at her paperwork.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Twilight shifted the papers. “I’m trying to arrange a clerical error that has Discord’s statue shipped to the Griffins.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Spike paused. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Twilight replied. “I mean, we’ll be on call in case it turns out to be less funny and more tragic. But I’m partly wondering if he even <i>can</i> discordify a griffin – does he just rely on the magic of cutie marks?”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.2</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Trixie said, trotting over. “I have a perfect plan for Nightmare Night!”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Twilight asked, looking over Trixie’s costume.</p><p class="double">The younger looper was, in fact, dressed as <i>Maleficent</i> – hopefully just a fashion choice… but after a moment Twilight mentally shrugged. After all, she’d worn practically every Nightmare Night costume she could think of.</p><p class="double">For that matter, she was just going to ascend for her costume this time.</p><p class="double">“Observe!” Trixie said, lifting something from the nearest rooftop and bringing it down for investigation. “A simple firework.”</p><p class="double">“Yes…” Twilight said, warily.</p><p class="double">“It is completely safe, having only enough fuel to fly for half a second, and burns up completely upon exploding – the actual pyrotechnics come from a small bound spell which produces only light,” Trixie continued, indicating components of the rocket.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight nodded. “Looks nice and safe. Entirely subdued. <i>How many did you set?</i>”</p><p class="double">Trixie pondered. “Not sure. I lost count somewhere around twelve thousand.”</p><p class="double">“Celestia’s star, Trixie!” Twilight said, then lowered her voice at the looks of ponies around them. “Sorry. But with that many-”</p><p class="double">“At least twice that many. I lost count many times.”</p><p class="double">“With a minimum of twenty-four thousand fireworks, it doesn’t matter how small they are, it’s going to look like the whole town’s exploding.” Twilight threw up her hooves. “Right, I suppose it’s too late to take them down again. But be careful!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna circled Ponyville, preparing for her return to partake of the festivities in this Nightmare Night.</p><p class="double">Something about her dark side? She wasn’t sure of the details. About all she’d been able to get out of Celestia was that costumes were worn.</p><p class="double">Then there was a huge <i>bang</i>, followed by a hissing shriek that went on and on. Her guards nearly flubbed their wingbeats as Ponyville was enveloped in fire and smoke.</p><p class="double">Red and orange and yellow sparks fountained out of the top of a smoke-shrouded cone shape as she looked on, astonished. There were periodic explosions, sending the smoke rippling away, and then a huge shape of winged fire shot skywards. Extending feathered wings with a <i>craaaack</i>, it turned – revealing itself to be a huge phoenix – and ascended into the heavens.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Don’t you think you overdid it!?” Twilight shouted, hooves and wings over her head.</p><p class="double">Trixie adjusted her hat as firework launch sticks rained down. “Not really. All Trixie did was give Ponyville itself a Nightmare Night costume – as the site of the birth of a phoenix!”</p><p class="double">“…phoenixes don’t do that,” Twilight deadpanned. “Seriously, when they hatch they just <i>hatch</i>. They’re birds, not volcanoes.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Trixie shrugged. “Better than nothing.”</p><p class="double">Luna’s chariot half-crashed into the library. The princess and her guards tumbled out, running for cover as Luna snapped off spells skywards.</p><p class="double">“Princess!” Twilight called. “Over here!”</p><p class="double">“WE ARE UNDER ATTACK!” Luna shouted. “SOME KIND OF GRIFFIN TRICK, WE THINK!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head in exasperation. This was going to be one hell of a letter to Celestia. (The salient point would probably be ‘please don’t invade the Griffin Lands’).</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.3</p><p class="double">Celestia ran, the sick taste of failure in her mouth.</p><p class="double">Her student – her <i>beloved</i> student – had fallen into corruption no less deep than Luna’s own, of a thousand years past. And all five of her friends had fallen the same way.</p><p class="double">She was being chased through her own castle by six twisted alicorns, who blew walls and columns aside to follow her.</p><p class="double">Then there was a blur of motion.</p><p class="double">“Haha! Have at thee!” a familiar voice said, accompanied by a musical series of twangs.</p><p class="double">Celestia turned to find Discord – <i>Discord?</i> – holding off dark-Applejack and dark-Fluttershy with a piano in one hand and a duck in the other.</p><p class="double">“Celestia!” he said, shouting over his shoulder while making it rain tofu to slow the alicorns down. “Retreat! Get out of the castle, I’ll join you outside!”</p><p class="double">Thoroughly confused, Celestia looked for a good escape route. The windows caught her eye, but dark-Rainbow Dash shot past them as she made for the closest.</p><p class="double">Another Discord ran past her in the other direction, wielding a swordfish and a scroll marked ‘FiM script, S4E1’. “They’re this way as well!”</p><p class="double">Her head swivelled. Yes, the first Discord was still where she’d last seen him, and the second one wasn’t something she’d imagined – he was dance-battling dark-Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">“Hurry up!” Discord implored her. “You’re the only one who can use the Elements of Blarmony!”</p><p class="double">Celestia frowned. “Elements of <i>WHAT?”</i></p><p class="double">Both Discords and all four visible alicorns sighed. Twilight and Rarity materialized next to Celestia, and all six of them went back to normal.</p><p class="double">“Smooth move, Doofus,” Twilight said, hitting the left one on the head with a baguette the right one handily provided. “You couldn’t have come up with a better name?”</p><p class="double">“I was under pressure, so sue me.” Discord crossed his arms and huffed. The other one put on a lawyer’s wig and began taking depositions from the six Element bearers.</p><p class="double">“…what?” Celestia said helplessly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Celestia,” Twilight apologized. “Next time we&#039;ll do much better.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... What do you mean, <i>next time</i>?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ignoring her mentor, Twilight turned to point at Discord and Pinkie. &quot;This is the last time I let you two plan our pranks.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why&#039;s that Twilight?&quot; Pinkie asked, tilting her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because you&#039;re <i>really</i> bad at it – too much improv. Seriously, next time Applejack and Fluttershy plan the prank, although you can of course offer suggestions.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.4</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Luna said, finishing her note. “Celestia’s Awake, as well… I checked.”</p><p class="double">“How?” her double asked.</p><p class="double">“We have a code. A flag she puts up if she’s Awake, so I can scry for it.” Darkness enveloped the note and it vanished. “Anyway, it’s sent.”</p><p class="double">“Good.”</p><p class="double">Both of them sniggered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, well, my beloved subjects,” Nightmare Moon began.</p><p class="double">“Excuse me?” a cross voice said from offstage. Another Nightmare Moon walked onto the dais from the left side. “<i>Your</i> subjects?”</p><p class="double">“They’re mine as <i>well,” </i>the first one said indignantly. “I think.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you think?” the left one said. “Well, <i>I know.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Doesn’t matter.” One Nightmare Moon stuck her tongue out at the other one. “‘cause it’s <i>my</i> Night.”</p><p class="double">“No it isn’t.”</p><p class="double">“Is too.”</p><p class="double">“Is not!”</p><p class="double">“Is too!”</p><p class="double">The assembled ponies of Ponyville watched with utter confusion as the two Nightmare Moons argued like fillies.</p><p class="double">“Is too, a hundred thousand times!”</p><p class="double">“Is not, infinity times!”</p><p class="double">The one who hadn’t just spoken paused, staring at her hooves. “Is too… infinity plus one times!”</p><p class="double">“That’s just infinity times. I win.” Another stuck-out tongue.</p><p class="double">“Why you…” The right-hand Nightmare Moon reared up, and slapped her counterpart on the cheek.</p><p class="double">The other one touched the mark, and then slapped back.</p><p class="double">“…what the buck?” Rainbow Dash whispered to Twilight. “Is that evil alicorn having a slap fight with herself?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, there was an explosion of light in the corner. “GIRLS!”</p><p class="double">Both dark alicorns froze, blushing guiltily.</p><p class="double">“Why are you arguing?” Celestia asked, stepping from the flare of her appearance.</p><p class="double">“She started it,” the left one said quickly.</p><p class="double">“Did not!”</p><p class="double">“Girls!” Celestia sighed. “Fine, I don’t want to know. Just say sorry to one another.”</p><p class="double">“…sorry,” the right hand one said grudgingly.</p><p class="double">“Sorry to you too.”</p><p class="double">“Right. All better?”</p><p class="double">The two Nightmares nodded. “Yes, big sister.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Now, go to your rooms. I’ll deal with you later.” As the two identical alicorns vanished in teleports, Celestia turned to the crowd. “Sorry, my younger sisters can be a little impetuous at times. Where were we?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Laughter rang in the halls of Princess Luna’s room.</p><p class="double">“That was <i>hilarious!”</i> Luna said, finally calming herself enough to speak.</p><p class="double">The alicorn filly on the bed giggled. “Bet we confused everypony!”</p><p class="double">Luna nodded. “Yep. You know, Nyx? I like your style.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.5 (QI based Loop)</p><p class="double">Twilight shuffled her papers. “Good evening, good evening, good evening, good <i>evening!</i> And welcome to QA, the show that’s all about things which are amazing. With me tonight are the Monarch of Mirth, Discord!”</p><p class="double">The assembled audience applauded.</p><p class="double">“The Sovereign of the Stars, Nightmare Moon!”</p><p class="double">More applause.</p><p class="double">“The Mistress of Mutability, Queen Chrysalis!”</p><p class="double">A buzzing underlay this applause.</p><p class="double">“And… the court jester, Prince Blueblood.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood rolled his eyes. He didn’t know either why or how Twilight Sparkle had managed to get three major threats to Equestria onto her panel game, but Auntie had made him be the recurring guest.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight’s horn glowed, and an illusion appeared in the air – the city of Manehattan. “The first question is, why is Manehattan called the Big Apple?”</p><p class="double">Blueblood pressed his buzzer, which produced a short burst of circus music. That made him seethe – and he’d bet a thousand bits the other three had some kind of royal march.</p><p class="double">“Yes, Blueblood?” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“It’s from a series of race meetings,” he answered confidently.</p><p class="double">Alarms went off, the words “race meetings” appearing in place of the skyline.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, as Blueblood triggered one of the “wrong answer” traps. She had to set them up ahead of time, so it was just bad luck – or credulousness – which meant he kept hitting them. “No, sorry, that’s not correct.”</p><p class="double">Discord buzzed in with a brief snatch of <i>The Duke of Plaza-torro.</i> “It’s because the Apple clan were involved in settling it.”</p><p class="double">“Is the right answer!” Twilight conjured more images.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon spoke up. “Was that not when they were a family of nobility?”</p><p class="double">“That’s right, points for that,” Twilight said. “Not many know that the Apples at one point had a patent of nobility. I understand that it more-or-less lapsed fifty years or so later when none of them really <i>wanted</i> it; though their seat in the parliament lost through the patent was quickly replaced by one won in election.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.6</p><p class="double">“What do you want to do, Rarity?” Spike asked. “Next time, I mean.”</p><p class="double">Rarity frowned. “…surprise me.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Spike blinked. “Are you sure?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” The unicorn nodded emphatically. “This is supposed to be a two way street, but you’ve just been a little too accommodating… which is sweet of you, but it doesn’t give me much of an idea of what <i>you</i> like.”</p><p class="double">“Fair point.” Spike scratched the back of his neck. “I’ll see what I can think of, then.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I don’t know,” Twilight said, shaking her head. “And if I did I wouldn’t tell you. She has a point.”</p><p class="double">“I guess so.” Spike hung his head, then looked up again and started walking off muttering to himself.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright,” Rarity said eventually, “this is a fairly pleasant walk, but I’m sure that’s not what you were going for.”</p><p class="double">“Not really, no,” Spike replied.</p><p class="double">“And I suspect what you <i>are</i> going for is in that bag?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Spike adjusted the strap. “Not far to go…”</p><p class="double">Around a minute later, they emerged into a fair sized clearing – the first they’d encountered in the hour or two they’d been walking through White Tail Woods.</p><p class="double">At the far end were a number of round straw butts, with concentric rings painted on them.</p><p class="double">Rarity squinted. “Are those… archery butts?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Spike slung the bag down off his shoulder and extracted a yew longbow, as well as a smaller bow made with more modern composites. “Which would you rather use?”</p><p class="double">She took the smaller bow. “This one, I think… I didn’t know you liked archery.”</p><p class="double">“It’s a kind of Jedi training – I don’t know if Twilight told you about that whole thing?” She shook her head, so Spike went on. “Basically, my… third loop, I think, Twilight and I were part of this kind of awesome order of ninja magic monks. They taught a lot of self control stuff, which…”</p><p class="double">Spike broke off and gestured to himself. “It’s been kind of helpful for me, it’s where the age shifting got started. And it’s been useful otherwise. But archery’s really helpful training how to use some of the powers – because if you can see where the arrow would hit if you let go, then you can aim it properly. And that helps train precognition.”</p><p class="double">“You can see the future?” Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">“Only really, really close in stuff. Second or two.” Spike shrugged self-deprecatingly. “It’s based on what almost <i>has</i> to happen, unless you do something different – more or less. I don’t really follow it myself… anyway.” He picked up the yew bow and an arrow, and began breathing steadily.</p><p class="double">An image began to appear in his mind – an arrow, striking the outer ring of the straw. Concentrating on the image, willing it to stay stable, he tracked slowly across until the arrow hit dead centre.</p><p class="double">Then he released the string.</p><p class="double">Rarity applauded politely as it struck. “Very well done.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks,” he said, blushing slightly. “Your turn.”</p><p class="double">The whole smaller bow glowed and lifted into the air, accompanied by an arrow. Rather than vertically as Spike had to, the unicorn held hers horizontally – sighting carefully down the arrow, and then raising it slightly.</p><p class="double"><i>Swoosh-thwack!</i></p><p class="double">Spike blinked at the arrow, right on the outer ring of the bull. “Wow.” Then he looked suspicious. “Have you done this before?”</p><p class="double">“Guilty as charged!” Rarity said. “I actually do this a little myself – though not to any great standard.”</p><p class="double">“If that’s not a great standard, I’d like to see what is…” Spike said. “Shall I move them further away?”</p><p class="double">“That would be nice.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.7</p><p class="double"><b>“Crystals.”</b></p><p class="double">“Okay!” Pinkie said abruptly, pulling out a hat and apron – followed by a table, a cash register and a sign. “Welcome to Crystal Catering, can I take your order?”</p><p class="double">Sombra blinked. <b>“What?”</b></p><p class="double">“We~ll…” Pinkie slid a menu across the table and checked her hat. “We have a full selection of crystal varieties – Olivine structure to Quartz structure, and in carbon or silicon-based with various additives. If you want an ionic structure, that’s extra unless it’s on the menu.”</p><p class="double"><b>“Um…”</b> The startled unicorn took the menu and began reading it out of reflex. <b>“Barite bonanza, please.”</b></p><p class="double">“Okay, coming up!” Pinkie vanished through a door that hadn’t been there before, and turned up again after a lot of grinding noises. She passed the plate to him and pointed out a table. “Here you go! Extra Iridium on top.”</p><p class="double"><b>“Thank you.”</b> Sombra dropped some bits on the counter and turned for the table.</p><p class="double">“…<i>seriously?</i>” Shining Armor asked. “He was <i>hungry?</i>”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “I dunno.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.8 (Serenova)</p><p class="double">Twilight awoke sitting in a chair. It was nice to be sitting down for once. Before she even opened her eyes she checked her loop memories. The fact that she felt funny sitting in the chair meant that she wasn&#039;t in her normal quadrupedal form.</p><p class="double">She had to hold back a groan as she realized this was another Trek loop. At least she wasn&#039;t shaped like a pony this time - THAT had been one bucking weird loop.</p><p class="double">Slowly taking inventory of her loop memories, she figured out her family history and that she was on the Enterprise-D. That would explain the slight vibration she felt through her boots. Finally opening her eyes she took a look around and took stock of her quarters. From what she knew of this loop, it was standard crew quarters. Bedroom, bathroom (sonic shower included) and living area. She was seated at the desk in the desk in the living area, apparently going over reports from some physics experiment she was working on. As she began reading through the notes on the PADD in front of her she was interrupted by the computer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Incoming transmission from Shining Armor,&quot; the computer intoned.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to the monitor on the desk and said, &quot;On screen.&quot; The screen lit up and she was greeted with a very confused person, who, coincidentally was Shining Armor. &quot;Shiny!&quot; she said happily, &quot;To what do I owe the honor?&quot; She didn&#039;t know if this version of her brother was looping or not and didn&#039;t want to give anything away until she knew. None of the other elements were with her (she had felt along the connection and gotten nothing), but she had no magical connection with her brother to check.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m awake Twilight, please tell me you know how to walk on two legs,&quot; Shiny said plaintively.</p><p class="double">Twilight burst into giggles at her brother. &quot;It&#039;s easier to use your loop memories for moving around,&quot; she said through her giggles. &quot;I&#039;m about…&quot; and she paused to check how far she was from their supposed home, &quot;Twelve hundred light years from you right now, so you&#039;re on your own with getting around,&quot; she finished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww, man, and Cadence isn&#039;t awake either,&quot; Shiny almost whined.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t you start that with me B.B.B.F.F.!&quot; Twilight said with a smile, &quot;You&#039;d just grab her and go on another honeymoon. I&#039;m going to try to grab some tech to have for when we&#039;re back home while we&#039;re here. I&#039;m thinking some tricorders will do well, along with some medical supplies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor just shook his head at his sister, &quot;You do that, I&#039;m going to figure out what in the world I actually do here. I&#039;ll talk to you later,&quot; he said, and the connection went dead.</p><p class="double">Shaking her head, Twilight went back to what she had been doing this loop.</p><p class="double">Three days and a skirmish with the Romulans later, she was praying for this loop to be over. She&#039;d already replicated two tricorders (one science, one medial) and stuffed them in her subspace pocket. She&#039;d also nabbed a hypospray and some extra PADDs with medical and scientific data in them. She figured the looping Applebloom and Scootaloo would appreciate it at least, along with adding to her own reading. She only wished that there was actual paper around, but she&#039;d live. It was harder to not slip up around Captain Picard. She was very experienced with random loops by now, but even non-Looping Picard could be intimidating. Especially when Twilight&#039;s base self in this loop was much like the studious original Twilight before she started looping.</p><p class="double">Eventually, Twilight managed to enjoy herself and relaxed for the rest of the loop. She was glad she wasn&#039;t replacing anyone important and simply let herself enjoy being along for the ride. Designating this as a recreational loop (even if she worked really – that science experiment she was running), would be nice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.9 (Indalecio) (Dragon Ball)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Apple Bloom woke up she felt, different, this loop. Coupled with the new memories slamming into her and the fact that she no longer had hooves, she could tell that she was going to be human for that loop.</p><p class="double">&#039;Well, this is a new experience I reckon.&#039; Twilight told her about some of the times that she was human, but it was the first time she was experiencing it for herself.</p><p class="double">Apparently her name was Bloom Apple, and she along with her sister Jacqueline Apple were the heirs to the large and wealthy Seed Corp.</p><p class="double">She turned back to the book and artifact she has been studying short before awakening. The Dragonballs, of which there were seven of, would grant one wish to whomever gathered them all. She had briefly considered wishing for the perfect colt...boyfriend. </p><p class="double">&#039;Need to watch those terms there.&#039; Her sister Jackie, had always been the refined, social butterfly, and truth be told, she had been a little jealous of the attention she got. But, after awakening, it seemed a waste of the awesome power of the dragon. </p><p class="double">&#039;But what to wish for? I guess it&#039;ll come to me in time.&#039; As she stepped out the door, she grabbed her backpack and took off for the unknown.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The boy named Goku sitting across from her kept giving her odd looks as they were eating. She was about to ask him about that when he finally spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re a looper, aren&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">It shouldn&#039;t have surprised her that there would be other loopers in this world, but it did. She finally found her voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, how did you know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is the third time I&#039;m looping. The person you&#039;re replacing, Bulma Briefs, looks different than you, also.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So what this this Bulma like?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s one of my oldest friends, she&#039;s a bit spoiled, but she&#039;s a genius engineer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So whats it like where you came from?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I and all my friends are ponies where we came from.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Little horse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Goku pointed to his throat.</p><p class="double">&quot;No...little horses. Ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahhh..&quot; said realization, but there was a hint of mischief in his eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;You..made that joke on purpose, didn&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;May....be..&quot; continuing he said &quot;Do you ponies have martial arts?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I been studying with my master Temple Fortress.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you like to learn human martial arts?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A..hmmm&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Goku took a few arm and leg bands from a bag he carried with him. They were indentical to ones he wore.</p><p class="double">&quot;Put these on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Taking the offered arm and leg bands, Applebloom noticed they were quite heavy.</p><p class="double">&quot;I spent a majority of my last loop learning Kaioshin magic, specifically learning on how to make thing heavy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Realization hit her. &quot;Oh these are for training.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They seem heavy now, but after awhile you get used them. And then you get heavier ones.&quot;</p><p class="double">Having put them on she felt like she could hardly move. This was definitly going to take some getting used to. She stretched her arms out and slowly waved them around.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve got a turtle to rescue.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">We awoke the next day and found the turtle just where Goku said he was. After talking with it, the turtle asked for some refreshments.</p><p class="double">&quot;Salt water? Seaweed? I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve got seaweed, but salt water is doable&quot; I got out a bucket, and put some water and salt in it.</p><p class="double">Taking the salt water, the turtle drank. &quot;The truth is, I&#039;ve wandering around the past year and I&#039;ve been trying all this time to get back to ocean&quot;</p><p class="double">I got out a map, and did some quick mental calculations. &quot;Thats 120km from here. You&#039;re going in the wrong direction. Wow. Thats far.&quot;</p><p class="double">The turtle looked cresfallen. &quot;We could take him to ocean. Thats no big deal.&quot; said Goku.</p><p class="double">I thought for a moment and fished around for my packet of seed caps. I selected one and after using, a hand cart appeared.</p><p class="double">&quot;We can use this and take turns.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">My arms were ready to fall off by the time we reached the sea. I was used to pulling carts in my pony form, but this was a totally different experience. In the end, I did most of the pulling, while Goku scouted. I could hear various roars and shouts as Goku cleared the path before us, and in the end we got there without problems.</p><p class="double">The turtle insisted on repaying us and after entering the ocean soon came back with a short, old man with a Turtle Shell on his back.</p><p class="double">After greeting us and introducing himself as the Turtle Hermit, he sought to give us a reward.</p><p class="double">&quot;Come! Immortal Phoenix!&quot; he shouted. After a few minutes of nothing happening, the turtle spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Umm...the Immortal Phoenix died of food poisoning.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh right. I was going to summon the Immortal Phoenix and grant you all eternal life..&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;If the Immortal Phoenix died of food poisoning, the immortality it granted probably wasn&#039;t it was cracked up to be&#039; I thought to myself.</p><p class="double">&quot;...but instead, I&#039;ll give you this!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nimbus! Come to me!&quot;</p><p class="double">This time, a cloud came down and stopped right in front of us.</p><p class="double">&quot;With this you&#039;ll be able to fly anywhere you want, but it only works for the pure of heart. Let me show you how it works.&quot; He jumped on it, and landed on top.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tada! Now you try it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Goku seemed slightly surprised by this, but jumped on and rode around it for awhile and came back to a stop in front of us.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just like old times.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing. Nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">I noticed what looked like the 3 star Dragonball hanging from the Turtle Hermits&#039; neck. &quot;Hey mister. Could we possibly have that ball thats hanging from your neck? It looks like one of the ones we&#039;ve been searching for.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She helped you out right?&quot; the hermit asked the turtle.</p><p class="double">&quot;She practically pulled me all the way here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! Thats pretty impressive! Not many girls your age would&#039;ve been able to do that. I guess you can have this. Its an old necklace I found at the bottom of the sea a hundred years ago.&quot; He handed the necklace to me and I examined it. It was the third star ball alright.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Bloom. Try to get on!&quot; I gently tried stepping on the cloud and it took my weight. With more confidence, I climbed on and held onto Goku.</p><p class="double">We thanked the Turtle Hermit and zoomed off into the night sky.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Normally Bulma isn&#039;t able to ride this, but you seemed like a good person, and this opens up our options.&quot; he continued. &quot;I think you impressed the Turtle Hermit, and I was a bit surprised as I&#039;ve never seen him able to ride it before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh? Why not?</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s actually a pretty decent guy, but he&#039;s usually really pervy.&quot; I giggled at that.</p><p class="double">&quot;So Goku, where to next?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was thinking of trying to learn shapeshifting. Want to try?</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">We dropped by a place called Aru Village and after settling things there between Oolong and the villagers, we received the Six Star ball for our efforts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oolong&#039;s a shapeshifter, but he never mastered it. Our next stop with Yamcha and Puar should go better as Puar&#039;s the better of the two.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who Yamcha and Puar?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yamcha&#039;s a desert bandit. He joined us in our adventures, but never managed to keep up. He dated Bulma for awhile, but it didn&#039;t pan out. Puar is his friend and as I said, a shapeshifter. He looks like a blue flying cat most of the time, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">After hitting a stretch of desert, Goku had Nimbus slow down. After searching awhile, we saw someone in the distance and sped to them.</p><p class="double">What had seemed like one figure, quickly became two, a woman with rainbow hair and a flying orange pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re looking for Yamcha..the desert..bandit&quot; and then Goku couldn&#039;t hold it together, he burst out laughing, nearly falling off the cloud, and after what he&#039;d just told me, I couldn&#039;t blame him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash? Scootaloo?&quot; The two looked pretty angry by whole thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Its Dashcha the dessert bandit!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Scoot!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoever told you our names was way off. I&#039;m not sure why you came out here, if you know of us, but you&#039;re going to regret it. Give us all your capsules and you money, and maybe we&#039;ll think of letting you live.&quot;</p><p class="double">So, they weren&#039;t awake this time. And yet, being on this cloud, I couldn&#039;t help but smile at the irony of Rainbow being on the ground at this point. And apparently Goku couldn&#039;t either, for his own reasons, as he, unable to contain himself, finally did fall off the cloud.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry. Sorry. You just weren&#039;t what I expected.&quot; He sniffed and smiled. &quot;Again. Sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not sorry enough!&quot; as she drew her sword and attacked Goku. Goku fought back, dodging and weaving and eventually knocking her on her butt.</p><p class="double">&quot;Feh. So you&#039;ve got some skill afterall.&quot; Dashcha stood up and dusted herself off. &quot;So why did you come out all this way.&quot;</p><p class="double">I spoke up. &quot;We actually came to see Scoot.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We heard there was a shapeshifter in the area and wanted to see if you could teach us shapeshifting.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scoot was about say something when Dashcha cut in. &quot;Whats in it for us?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;ve got one capsule with a car with a full tank of gas in it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds fair. Alright, we accept.&quot; said Dashcha, Scoot still trying to get in a word edgewise.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So I was going to say, I can unlock the ability to shapeshift, but after that, it takes a lot of practice in order to do it well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;m okay with that. You can&#039;t get very far in anything without practicing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, the two of you stand still for a moment.&quot; Scoots hovered over and placed her hooves on mine and Goku&#039;s forehead. I felt warm for a moment and I felt a whole less solid, like I could collapse into a pile of jelly at any moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, now try to these simple exercises...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Goku&#039;s POV</p><p class="double">While Bloom was practicing shapeshifting, I decided on trying to spar with Dashcha, again.</p><p class="double">&quot;So Goku, where&#039;d you learnt to fight?&quot; I dodged one of Dashcha kicks.</p><p class="double">&quot;From my grandpa, Gohan Son.&quot; And returned on of my own, which she didn&#039;t bother blocking, but as soon as she got up, she became all excited</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my gosh! You&#039;re related to Gohan SOn? He&#039;s like really famous. After the Turtle and Crane Hermits, he&#039;s probably like the second strongest martial artist in the world. Oh hey! Let me get my scrapbook.&quot;</p><p class="double">Living up her name, Dashcha ran off and in maybe 10 to 15 minutes later returned with a scrapbook. It had lots of old newsclipping and pictures of the Turtle Hermit, the Ox-King and Gohan Son.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow. There isn&#039;t anything I&#039;d wouldn&#039;t do to meet the Turtle Hermit, but he&#039;s probably dead by now. No one&#039;s heard from him decades. But I&#039;d love to meet one of his students.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, we just saw the Turtle Hermit this morning. And my grandfather&#039;s on Mt. Paozu. I&#039;m sure he&#039;d love a visit from a fan.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;ohmygosh,ohmygosh,ohmygosh,ohmygosh,ohmygosh!&quot; Dashcha started hyperventilating and grabbed me and screamed into my face. &quot;Where! Where did you see him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;By the coast. I think he lives off on an island somewhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is so awesome! Scoots! We&#039;re going!&quot; Dashcha grabbed Scoots hoof and ran off in the direction of the ocean.</p><p class="double">&quot;They didn&#039;t even take the capsule we promised them.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Bloom&#039;s POV</p><p class="double">&quot;I know the next Dragonball is on Frypan Mountain. I&#039;m a little anxious. This is the time and place I met my future wife Chichi and her father the Ox-King.”</p><p class="double">We were zipping along on Nimbus heading for a next destination.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh? What are they like?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Ox-King is a huge mountain of a man, and very protective of his daughter. Chichi was also a fierce martial artist, and had a clumsy awkwardness she later grew out of. In her later years, she was very education minded, and made our eldest son, Gohan, study all the time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You named him after your Grandpa?&quot;</p><p class="double">Goku got quiet for a moment. &quot;Yeah. In my original timeline, I….killed my grandpa without knowing it. You saw my tail right?&quot; He wriggled it around for emphasis and it tickled my nose.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, what’s that got to do with anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If I have it, if it’s not cut off, I transform into a giant ape when seeing the full moon, mindlessly destroying things and….people.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In my first loop, I avoided looking at the moon, and my grandpa still lived in that loop. Along with learning Kaioshin magic, I also learned to control the were-ape form. It took a year of constantly transforming, but I managed to get it down. My grandpa still lives in this loop too, and for that I&#039;m glad.&quot;</p><p class="double">Goku continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I see Frypan Mountain in the distance. Strange, it’s not on fire. Let’s land.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Goku&#039;s POV</p><p class="double">I hopped off of Nimbus with Bloom right behind me. Up upon Frypan Mountain, I could see Ox-King&#039;s castle. Down below, was a small village bustling with activity.</p><p class="double">&quot;It seems so normal…&quot; I scratched my head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! You must be tourists! I knew a little advertising would pay off. Please, please let me show you around.&quot; I turned to the voice, seeing a girl about my age. She looked like Chichi, sounded like Chichi, but she wasn&#039;t Chichi. It must have been the purple hair, and purple wizard robe and hat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Chichi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me?&quot; She looked inquisitively at me.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you Chichi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twi Lee.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. Are you Twilight Sparkle?&quot; Bloom interjected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! You must be loopers! I was wondering when someone else was going to show up. Honestly, I haven&#039;t the foggiest idea what I&#039;m doing this loop. It’s all very refreshing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Uh oh. Guess I&#039;d better not spoil any of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;It’s me! Applebloom!&quot; She pulled Twilight into a quick hug.</p><p class="double">&quot;Applebloom! You&#039;re….can&#039;t….breathe.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom eased up and let Twilight down. &quot;How are you? Have you seen any of the Cutie Mark Crusaders?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m good. I&#039;ve just seen Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo, but they&#039;re not loopers this time, though they&#039;ve replaced some friends of Goku, here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pleased to meet you&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, so you must be familiar with this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Looped two times already. So far each has lasted about 80 years.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! That long? Ours just lasts a few years.&quot; She paused, and then continued. &quot;So, when you landed, you said everything looked normal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, usually everything&#039;s on fire. The Ox-king sets fire to the area surrounding his castle to protect his treasure, but it goes out of control, and he isn&#039;t able to get inside.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh dad… I guess it’s kinda weird to be calling him dad… I convinced him not to do that. There&#039;s natural gas pockets all over the area. Instead, we&#039;re now mining the natural gas and using it heat the castle and surrounding residences….&quot;</p><p class="double">At this point I zoned out. Bloom looked really interested, and conversed excitedly with Twi Lee. I was hoping to pick up some science and engineering-fu, but I guess it wouldn&#039;t be this loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Goku and Twi Lee rode the nimbus until they started passing over a mushroom forest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Bloom, are you ready?&quot; The disembodied voice of Bloom Apple answered from a suitcase that was also on this cloud.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ready as I&#039;ll ever be.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You sure this is going to work?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! This is going to be great! First they&#039;ll see the dragonballs, and then &#039;Pow&#039;!&quot;</p><p class="double">A minute later a rocket propelled grenade shot at them. Goku narrowly dodge but dropped the suitcase. He quickly turned around, but someone in a mini-mecha ran up and grabbed suitcase.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stop!&quot; cried Goku waving his arms.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your acting is terrible.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It worked, didn&#039;t it? Now we just need to chase after them, but not too fast.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The self-styled Emperor Pilaf stood with his underlings Mai, a woman sporting ex-Red Ribbon army fatigues and duster, and Shu, a short, dog-faced Ninja. We&#039;re not sure what Emperor Pilaf is, but he appears to a goblin in what could charitably be called a clown suit.</p><p class="double">&quot;All the dragonballs! At last the world will be mine!&quot; Emperor Pilaf cackled loudly and his henchmen soon joined in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, why does one of the Dragonballs have eyes?&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a large puff of smoke, and then &#039;Pow!&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;This is Bloom. Come in Goku and Twi Lee.&quot; Bloom spoke into her cellphone over the 3 unconscious forms of Pilaf, Mai and Shu and all 7 Dragonballs.</p><p class="double">&quot;We read you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve got the Dragonballs.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you have trouble?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;E-nope&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Miles away from there, on the desert floor, three figures assembled with all seven Dragonballs gathered before them. The balls glowed, and a giant purple dragon appeared.</p><p class="double">&quot;I AM SPIKRON, THE ETERNAL DRAGON. SPEAK YOUR WISH NOW, AND I WILL GRANT IT.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom stepped forward. &quot;I want all our friends from Ponyville and all Goku&#039;s friends to be awake in this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom explained the situation.</p><p class="double">&quot;THAT IS BEYOND MY POWER. SPEAK ANOTHER WISH AND I WILL GRANT IT.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom thought for a moment. &quot;You know Goku&#039;s saiyan heritage and giant monkey form. I want something very similar to it, just as giant equine form.&quot; Turning to Twi Lee, she asked &quot;Do you want in on this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twi Lee frowned. &quot;No, I&#039;m good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, then just for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;IT SHALL BE DONE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Out of the base of Bloom&#039;s back appeared a long red pony tail.</p><p class="double">&quot;YOUR WISH HAS BEEN GRANTED! FAREWELL!&quot; the eternal dragon vanished, the balls dimmed to pieces of rock and scattered to the four corners of the world.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Goku frowned for a moment. &quot;That might not have been the best wish to make. You&#039;ll be at the mercy of the full moon, and the transformation is quite painful, blinding you to what’s going on around you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mastered it, didn&#039;t you?&quot; said Bloom absentmindedly, examining her new tail.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah, but it took me a year. A long year of waking up naked surrounded by destruction. Just be careful not to look at the moon until you get it. Meditate and train a lot, it should help, especially the meditation.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a pause and Twi Lee spoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;I kinda wish Spike had been awake, though. I can&#039;t wait to tell him about this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom continued examining her tail. &quot;He was pretty cool.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know the Dragon?</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s my assistant back in my home loop, but he&#039;s only a baby at the time. Just yea tall&quot;, said Twi Lee, gesturing.</p><p class="double">Goku turned to Bloom. &quot;Well we found the Dragonballs, mission accomplished. What do you plan on doing now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm…Ah&#039;ve got school in a couple of weeks, so I&#039;m probably going to go home. What about you two?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twi Lee and I have been talking. We&#039;re going to visit my grandpa on Mt. Paozu for a bit, and then maybe wander around. Maybe see Otherworld. I might be able to coax King Kai into teaching us more Kaioshin magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds fun. Do you want to meet up again when the Dragonballs return?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Count on it!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">And time passed. Goku and Twi Lee travelled around. They visited Goku&#039;s grandpa on Mt. Paozu, the Turtle Hermit, King Kai and finally found themselves on planet Yardrat, generally seeing the sights, and picking up new tricks when they could.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Goku and Twi Lee use instant transmission to travel to King Kai&#039;s planet, appearing in a flash of light. They fall before King Kai and genuflect.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please train us!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you people?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After Bloom experimented with her were-pony for the first time, she vowed to make the creation of stretchy clothes a priority.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dashcha finally found the Turtle Hermit and began training with him. Later as Bloom went to search for the Dragonballs again, Dashcha approached her with a request.</p><p class="double">&quot;Training with the Turtle Hermit is a dream come true. But I keep wondering, with him being so old now, What was he like in his prime? I gotta know. I heard the Dragonballs can grant any wish. I want to see and be trained by Master Roshi in his prime. Can we ask the Dragon to grant that wish?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">We eventually found some of the other Elements of Harmony.</p><p class="double">Rarity and SweetieBelle had taken the place of Goku&#039;s old rivals Tien and Chaotzu and we confronted them at the world tournament.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarien, sporting a small blue gem in the centre of her forehead and clad in a purple sari, confronts Dashcha at the Tenkaichi Budokai tournament.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your orange gi clashes with my purple sari. We&#039;ll have to fix that,&quot; said Rarien with a smirk and small emphasis on the way she said &quot;fix&quot;.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy took the place of Launch, now calling her self Kachushy, and was taking care of Piccolo Jr, after we had dealt with his genocidal father.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Kachushy stands before a Piccolo that’s at least a head taller than her and stares him in the eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;No Piccolo, you&#039;re not killing anyone, you hear? I thought I taught you better than that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, mom.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie we didn&#039;t find until many years later.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A dwarfish alien clad in wizard robes stands before a large organic sphere that suddenly split in two. The room fills with steam.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, yes! Arise Majin Pie and serve Babidi as you&#039;ve served my father before.&quot;</p><p class="double">Finally a woman with bright pink skin and clad in a stereotypical genie&#039;s clothes appears.</p><p class="double">&quot;I feel sick&quot;</p><p class="double">She barfed four times, her mouth growing cartoonishly wide each time, each time vomiting up one the swallowed supreme kais.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ughhh….&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.10 (by Ranma-Sensei) (Hey, Arnold)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Huh, seems like I have a middle sister, this loop. Well, at least it’s not Asuka, again. And it’s definitely better than Ranma Heyerdahl.”</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her eyes. The first thing she noticed was herself being human. The next, that before her stood a human girl, about 1.20 meters in height and wearing two pigtails of golden blond hair. “Uh, hi?”</p><p class="double">The girl before her sighed exasperatedly. “Please don’t tell me this is your first fused loop.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “No, I just tend to awake mid-stride it seems, and I ran into a wall, this time.” She smiled. “Twilight Pataki, nice to meet you. So, what do you do around here…. Helga?”</p><p class="double">Helga G. Pataki grinned. “Oh, troll my peers, usually. When people around you have the mental capacities of Fourth-Graders, you’ve got to be inventive.” She turned thoughtful. “I wonder if Arnold’s awake.”</p><p class="double">Twilight searched her Looper memories. “The boy you have a crush on?”</p><p class="double">Helga gave her a withering look. “I’m only saying this once: I. Love. Arnold. No crush, capiche?”</p><p class="double">The pony-once-again-turned-human nodded frantically. “Okay, change of topic: Why am I wearing Gothic style clothes?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. Here she had hoped to get a chance at studying in a nuclear society school. Instead, all her peers seemed to want to do was slack off and beat up on younger students, as was currently the case….</p><p class="double">“Yo, shorty!” the boy she had come to know as Wolfgang hollered, “Get your weird football head out of my way.” The next moment he shoved Arnold against the hallway’s wall.</p><p class="double">Twilight bristled. “Wolfgang!” Stepping forward, she grabbed onto the boy’s neck, which was considerably helped by the fact that she was bigger than him. “What do you think you are doing to my sister’s friend?”</p><p class="double">“More like <i>boy</i>friend, if you ask me.” the spindly boy next to her sniggered.</p><p class="double">Wolfgang flailed around. “Shut it, Edmund, and help me!”</p><p class="double">At this point, Twilight had quite enough and swung the bully around, letting him drop on his ass behind her. “Get lost, Wolfgang.”</p><p class="double">“I will get you, Pataki, I swear. One day, I <i>will</i> get you!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, right.” Turning around, she said: “Boo.” Laughing as the goon squad turned tail and ran, Twilight then helped Arnold up. “You alright?”</p><p class="double">“I think so.” Dusting himself off, the football-headed boy then extended a hand. “Arnold Shortman, Helga’s boyfriend. And you must be Twilight, I presume?”</p><p class="double">“Uh, yeah.” Taking the proferred hand and shaking it, Twilight grinned. “So, I take it you are awake, too?”</p><p class="double">“Yep, and as Helga, I am grateful you are nothing like Asuka or….” he shuddered, “Lina.”</p><p class="double">“Say….” Twilight gauged him. “What do I have to do around here to get some studying done?”</p><p class="double">“I…. think I can help with that.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"> “This is great!” Twilight rolled around on her bed and squealed. The moment Arnold had shown her to the public library, her eyes had gone all watery. It was a little upsetting that it had taken so long to register for a library card, and only being allowed to borrow twenty books at once felt unfair, but according to Helga she had a rough timeframe of about one year and a half, so it was only a minor setback.</p><p class="double">“Time to start having fun,” she said, and opened the book labelled <i>Astrophysics 101</i>. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.11 (Elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, why didn&#039;t you come forward? Most newly Awakened ponies seek me or the Princesses out for help within the first few Loops...&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh looked sheepish. After the scene Twilight had made at Sweet Apple Acres last night, he had wanted nothing more than to bury his head in one of his freshly-plowed fields. The fact that both his sisters were constantly badgering him about the cause of said fracas made the subject even more awkward.</p><p class="double">Now, to clear the air, Twilight had offered to straighten things out (after a good day and a half&#039;s rest), on the condition that he agree to be interviewed.</p><p class="double">He sighed. Talking had gotten easier as time went by, but he still didn&#039;t like doing it unnecessarily. Might as well get it over with.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, ya see Ms. Twilight, ah didn&#039;t right notice for a while mahself. Mah routine&#039;s pretty straightforward, and some days it just runs into itself, often the only way ah keep track of time is from the seasons. Don&#039;t have much goin&#039; on aside from the farm, so harvestin&#039; and plantin&#039;s all that needs payin&#039; attention to. Plus, weird stuff happens around mah sister an&#039; y&#039;all mighty frequent, so things lahk a moon goddess attackin&#039; th&#039; Summer Sun Celebration didn&#039;t tip me off the first time it all repeated.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can see that, but you obviously noticed at some point. Why didn&#039;t you ask me then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, after ah sussed that the first few repeats weren&#039;t a string a&#039; coincidences ah couldn&#039;t pluck up the courage to ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh? Why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When y&#039; see somepony turn into ah goddess firsthoof, it don&#039;t seem quite appropriate to bother them just cause you think stuff oughta be happenin&#039; different.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paused. &#039;Alicorn Mode&#039; was certainly intimidating for non-Awake mortal ponies, a new Looper would plausibly have the same reaction.</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose that&#039;s reasonable. For the first couple of days, at least. But why didn&#039;t you come forward later that loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; then y&#039;all turned evil and yer dragon friend grew fifty stories high. Somethin&#039; about Eternal Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s ears fell. That loop. Now <i>that</i> was bad luck… apparently she was too skilled an actor for her own good by now.</p><p class="double">Macintosh continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;After thatn&#039;, ah was plum scared you&#039;d do it again, so ah resolved to keep as far away from ya as possible. Weird stuff kept right on happenin&#039;, an from that point on ah just tried to help any way ah could. Ah kept mah family safe, no matter what. Sometimes, one or both of mah sisters&#039;d act weird too, hangin&#039; around you an&#039; doin&#039; strange stuff, so ah never explained to them either. They kept forgettin&#039; stuff every time things reset anyway, so ah just kept quiet. Watchin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes widened. She briefly wondered if there were any other Loopers in Macintosh&#039;s position, whether her crazy antics had driven any other ponies into hiding.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, ah&#039;m not normally th&#039; kinda pony that needs change. Ah like a routine, an&#039; for things to be reliable-like. Over time though, it got painful watchin&#039; mah sisters, an&#039; other ponies, gettin&#039; hurt in stuff that ah could do somethin&#039; about. Ma an&#039; Pa may not be around, but they didn&#039;t raise me to be a stallion that&#039;d stand by when he could help. On the other hoof, ah didn&#039;t want to be a snack for no dragon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed. Best to just get this out as quick as possible.</p><p class="double">&quot;So over time, ah saw how little things would change what happened. Ah got to learnin&#039; the patterns, how ta change things without gettin&#039; attention off th&#039; scary purple unicorn. Ah guess this time ah finally did too much good.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight could feel her emotions roiling. Shame at scaring Macintosh, a touch of anger that he&#039;d been so vexing, and many others warred for dominance behind her eyes.</p><p class="double">In the end, she stretched up and put a hoof on Macintosh&#039;s shoulder.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well Big Macintosh, I guess I owe you an explanation. You see, it all started with this tree called Yggdrasil...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.3 redux (Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia ran, the sick taste of failure in her mouth.</p><p class="double">Her student – her <i>beloved</i> student – had fallen into corruption no less deep than Luna’s own, of a thousand years past. And all five of her friends had fallen the same way.</p><p class="double">She was being chased through her own castle by six twisted alicorns, who blew walls and columns aside to follow her.</p><p class="double">Then there was a blur of motion.</p><p class="double">“Haha! Have at thee!” a familiar voice said, accompanied by a musical series of twangs.</p><p class="double">Celestia turned to find Discord – <i>Discord?</i> – holding off dark-Applejack and dark-Fluttershy with a piano in one hand and a duck in the other.</p><p class="double">“Celestia!” he said, shouting over his shoulder while making it rain tofu to slow the alicorns down. “Retreat! Get out of the castle, I’ll join you outside!”</p><p class="double">Thoroughly confused, Celestia looked for a good escape route. The windows caught her eye, but dark-Rainbow Dash shot past them as she made for the closest.</p><p class="double">Another Discord ran past her in the other direction, wielding a swordfish and a scroll marked ‘FiM script, S4E1’. “They’re this way as well!”</p><p class="double">Her head swivelled. Yes, the first Discord was still where she’d last seen him, and the second one wasn’t something she’d imagined – he was dance-battling dark-Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Suddenly dark-Pinkie Pie left a howlish scream &quot;NO!&quot; and vanished, just to appear in front of Celestia, except as an earth pony completely untainted by the corruption.</p><p class="double">&quot;EVERYPONY STOP!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s the matter, Pinkie? We were doing so well.&quot; Twilight Sparkle appeared alongside her, now back as unicorn. Soon Twilight&#039;s friends appeared alongside them.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s... HER!&quot; The pink pony suddenly moved to where a white pegasus with a brown mane was apparently leading other ponies away.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, I&#039;m Pinkie Pie. Who are you?&quot; Pinkie Pie asked with a big smile.</p><p class="double">The surprise from the white pegasus faded back into a knowing smile as she looked to where Twilight was &quot;You caught me. I&#039;m Starlight Breaker.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Starlight... Nanoha?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Starlight Breaker nodded. &quot;Even stopping a prank for a visitor? I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m honored or disappointed. How have you been?&quot;</p><p class="double">“…what?” Celestia said helplessly as their lively chat continued. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.12 (Filraen) (31 minutes)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, we are already on air!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s voice brought Twilight Sparkle to her senses. One day wasn&#039;t nearly enough to get used to this loop. The world seemed nuclear-tech level but against all odds she hadn&#039;t seen any human or pony yet.</p><p class="double">Then again, Twilight Sparkle knew this was going to be a weird loop wen she saw herself in the mirror after awakening and saw Smarty Pants looking back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight Sparkle, anchorpony plush, placed her woollen hooves over the desk she was and looked at the camera with her button eyes in front of her in a way so she could also see the screens by its side, on containing the live TV broadcasting and the other scrolling text. &quot;Welcome back to 31 Minutes, the most important news bulletin on television.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mass protests have been happening in Puppetrolis in the last hours, and there it&#039;s our reporter Pinkie Pie to give us more information. Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double">The broadcasted image now showed Pinkie Pie, whose body was only a pink microphone with eyes, jumping up and down. &quot;Oh, hi Twilight! You know there&#039;s a lot of people here in Puppetrolis getting together so I made a note about that&#039;s happening.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Hi everypony, this is Pinkie Pie&#039;s Pop Poll! Today&#039;s question is &#039;what do they call you?&#039;&quot;</i> After a small introductory curtain the image showed Pinkie Pie asking different people the pop question. Answer ranges from &#039;no-face&#039; from a beheaded doll, to &#039;Nim&#039; from what appeared to be a black alicorn plushie, &#039;cool guy&#039; from an ice cream and &#039;R2-D2&#039; from a trash can from a park. What most confused Twilight was, except for the beheaded doll, everything could have eyes attached and if it had eyes it could talk even if it had no mouth. It didn&#039;t make any sense!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">By the end of the note Twilight could swear Pinkie Pie was having a wide smile if she had a mouth, waiting for her feedback. Well, the note itself wasn&#039;t actually bad but... &quot;Pinkie, what did it have with the mass protests in Puppetrolis?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Isn&#039;t it obvious, Twilight? Nopony has a good nickname, that must be why everypony is out here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;O...k...&quot; Twilight said barely containing the urge to scream in frustration. &quot;Thanks for the note, Pinkie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bye Twilight!&quot; And with that the direction cut transmission with Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Focusing herself to talking to her viewers again Twilight continued &quot;And now the weather forecast report with our meteorologist-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;ME! Nightmare Moon!&quot; Nightmare Moon looked as menacing as a big black alicorn plushie toy could be. &quot;Good evening, Twilight Sparkle.&quot; </p><p class="double">The anchorpony was confused: she had met Princess Luna in the editorial meeting earlier today, what could have happened?</p><p class="double">&quot;Psst, Twilight,&quot; Fluttershy, in a plastic doll body, approached her from the opposite side of Nightmare Moon. Apparently Twilight was dumbstruck for too long. &quot;Just go along for now, we are almost finished.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy was right, the weather report was the last part of today&#039;s program and it was Princess Luna&#039;s section.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; the anchorpony continued with false cheer. &quot;Good evening, Nightmare Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very good night for you too, Twilight Sparkle.&quot; Nightmare Moon answered emphasizing the word &#039;night&#039;. &quot;The next week on Puppetrolis will have clear skies all the time, giving a perfect opportunity to watch and enjoy the night sky.</p><p class="double">&quot;Temperatures will go on decline: for Tomorrow we expect zero degrees maximum and by the end of the week we&#039;ll have maximum around the one hundred negative degrees.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How that can be?&quot; Wronghooved, Twilight couldn&#039;t help but ask. &quot;We are in the middle of summer, and not even in the coldest winter days we get under minus ten degrees!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But that&#039;s obvious Twilight Sparkle. Because the night will last... FOREVER! MUAHAHAHAHA!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</i> A voice could be heard loud and clear through all the studio.</p><p class="double">&quot;Director Celestia?&quot; Hopefully she could help with this trouble.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I left something for you under the desk just in case something like that happened. Please free my sister from the blackness.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s laugh stopped cold when she saw Twilight arming herself and Fluttershy with some sprayers. &quot;No! Please! Anything but bleach!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Know what Nightmare Moon? I&#039;ve quite frustrated since I awoke yesterday and now you&#039;ve given me a great source of relief,&quot; Twilight said with a grin that matched Nightmare Moon&#039;s in her best days. &quot;Let&#039;s go girls.&quot;</p><p class="double">In the TV broadcasting screen Nightmare Moon&#039;s pursuit made the backdrop to the credits roll.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">17.13 (Namar13766)</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle and the rest of the looping Six exchanged surreptitious grins. For this loop, their plan for dealing with Nightmare Moon involved the introduction of pizza to Equestria, a spare Lance of Longinus from an Evangelion loop, and an operatically trained Spike, who possessed a singing voice that could cause a pair of panties to spontaneously combust.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait for the mayor to finish, let the curtains pull back, see a black cloud, and watch it form...KING SOMBRA?!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you? What have you done with Princess Celestia?&quot;</p><p class="double">The early-returned banished king merely smirked, sipped from a glass of water before speaking.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b><u><i>GREETINGS!

<p>18.1</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Do you like it?”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia blinked in shock. “This is… I don’t even know what this is.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that’s easy!” Twilight said. “I worked out exactly what you meant. I had to make some friends so that my plan for fighting back against Nightmare Moon would be safe!”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked at the padlocked fridge. “So…?”</p><p class="double">“So, this is my plan.” Twilight opened the door a crack, and grabbed at something with her telekinesis before slamming the door and repadlocking it in a trice.</p><p class="double">“Twilight… there is a Windigo on a leash in the room,” Celestia observed, beyond shock into a kind of glassy coolness.</p><p class="double">“Yep! That’s my plan.” Twilight held up the leash, easily corralling the thrashing monster with it. “It has double-code release authority – look, two leash handles!”</p><p class="double">“So your plan to deal with Nightmare Moon is…”</p><p class="double">“…to freeze her solid!” Twilight grinned earnestly. “It should be completely safe, my friends and I can do that whole friendship-blast thing from the Hearths Warming myth – we spent the whole afternoon practicing!”</p><p class="double">“…right.”</p><p class="double">“I call him Polaris!” A pink pony skidded into the room. “Isn’t he cute?”</p><p class="double">“Pinkie,” Twilight said with a groan. “Stop using puns that the Princess has no hope of possibly getting.”</p><p class="double">“But it’s a good pun!” Pinkie protested. “It’s totally high-brow satire! Look, he is a deterrent that would cause a winter and he’s called Polaris! Oh, oh! And just in case he does somehow get off his leash and decides to be a meany meany pants, Twilight here got Applejack and Rainbow these neat toasting forks to poke him with! Fire beats Ice!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They’re not toasting forks, Pinkie…” Twilight said wearily. “They&#039;re tridents.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey,” Pinkie looked upset. “Why do you get to make puns if I can&#039;t?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know what you mean, Pinkie,” Twilight said loftily.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“The Night Will Last Forever!”</p><p class="double">“So, then…” Twilight said, raising a hoof. Her other foreleg was still under the table. “Would you say you’re… angry at Princess Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“What?” Nightmare Moon laughed. “Anger does not even begin to encapsulate it!”</p><p class="double">“And you’re full of rage, pain and hatred?”</p><p class="double">“YES.” The alicorn stamped her hoof. “Y.E.S. I am angry. I am pained. I wish to make Celestia suffer on her sun for as long as I suffered on my moon, and then a thousand years more for every insult!”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight nodded. “Rarity?”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded.</p><p class="double">Together, they said, “Sic ‘em, boy!”</p><p class="double">And then there was a kind of howling roar and snow everywhere.</p><p class="double">When Nightmare Moon refocused, she was inside a comically large icecube and there was a thrashing monster being forced backwards by two tridents and a leash.</p><p class="double">Pinkie beamed. “Looks like you need to… chill off.”</p><p class="double">“YYYEEEEAAAAHHHH!”</p><p class="double">Everyone jumped. “What was that?” several voices asked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “…huh.”</p><p class="double">Discord petted the Windigo. “Oo’s a good boy? You are! You’re such an entropic little cutie, aren’t you?”</p><p class="double">The monster rolled over onto its back, tongue lolling out.</p><p class="double">“Can I keep him?” Discord pleaded. “I will hug him and call him Polaris and-”</p><p class="double">“Wait, why Polaris?” Dash asked.</p><p class="double">“That’s his name, duh.” Discord indicated the tag.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Was that Pinkie’s doing?”</p><p class="double">“Probably…” Twilight said. “Alright, if you’re good. But we might need him on occasion.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You eat emotions?” Twilight said. “Interesting.”</p><p class="double">“Why?” Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, Discord’s pet invited friends over.” Twilight dove for cover.</p><p class="double">“What?” Chrysalis looked dumbfounded. Then there was a chill wind, as a thousand ghostly shapes came over the walls.</p><p class="double">“So, what happens next?” Pinkie asked over the howling and buzzing. “One side feeds on love, the other side feeds on hate… who wins?”</p><p class="double">“Us,” Twilight said with a certain smug air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…yeah, this feels unfair.”</p><p class="double">The Crystal Empire promptly turned to ice.</p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight nodded. “Let’s go remove the Sombricicle and get them thawed out again.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.2</p><p class="double">Spike grinned. “Don’t worry, it’s safe. They have pegasi paralleling the jump, and they catch us if we’re too close for a safe open.”</p><p class="double">“So you said,” Rarity admitted, looking out the open bay door of <i>Jack of all Trades</i>. The airship’s engines were humming gently as they countered the wind, but otherwise holding them stationary over a plain south of Trottingham.</p><p class="double">“It’s the main reason you managed to talk me into this…”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Spike adjusted his parachute unnecessarily. “I do love this kind of thing, and you <i>did</i> say you wanted to see what I enjoyed. Just one jump, okay?”</p><p class="double">“I should hope so!” Rarity looked uncertain, then her resolve firmed. “Alright, I’m ready.”</p><p class="double">“Good.” Spike glanced over at the others – unicorns, earth ponies, even the odd pegasus with wings strapped or with wing injuries. Fellow thrill-seekers.</p><p class="double">Oh, he’d flown before – even if his ponderous flight as an adult dragon couldn’t compare to that one loop as a quicksilver pegasus – but somehow falling out of the sky was… more.</p><p class="double">At least he got a <i>lot</i> of fall time. They were high enough it would take something like two and a half minutes total to reach parachute-open time.</p><p class="double">“O-kay,” the jump master said. “On my count. Three. Two. One. Go!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike grinned, feeling the air rushing over his scales. Now <i>this</i> was what he called fun!</p><p class="double">There was a faint itch where his wings would be growing shortly… probably the instinctual reaction to being in the air. It was part of why he did this, really, the ability to get close to his species in a whole new way.</p><p class="double">Then he glanced over at Rarity, and saw something that worried him. Her eyes were closed, and she was breathing fast.</p><p class="double">It was a moment’s half-formed thought for him to steer over to her and grab on. “Rarity! Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“No,” Rarity said, her voice catching. “I… sorry, Spike, but… I…”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry. You’re safe,” Spike reassured her. “You’re wearing a parachute. It’s at least another minute until we need to open them. This isn’t the Young Fliers’ competition.”</p><p class="double">He kept talking, pitching his voice low, talking without really caring what he was saying so long as it was reassuring. Rarity started sobbing, clinging to him as if to reassure herself that he was there.</p><p class="double">“Ten seconds,” one of the pegasi said, as she began to quieten down. “Are you two alright?”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded back, and pulled his cord. His extra-sized parachute bloomed overhead, jerking them both back “up” – really a simple slowdown – but they were still moving quite fast.</p><p class="double">He adjusted his grip on the white unicorn as the grassy field below rushed up, and bore the brunt of the ground impact with a suppressed shout of pain.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I’m so sorry.” Rarity shook her head. “I didn’t think I’d go to pieces like that.”</p><p class="double">“No problem,” Spike assured her, scratching a spot on his back. Dragon scales were tough – he’d only bruised. “Wasn’t your fault.”</p><p class="double">“But I feel like it <i>is</i>. That’s a weakness, and…” Rarity trailed off, blinking furiously. “I… <i>deplore</i> feeling weak.”</p><p class="double">Spike spread his arms. After a moment, Rarity shook her head. “No thank you, Spike. Later, I think… maybe yes. But… not now.”</p><p class="double">“Alright.” The dragon nodded. “Kinda makes sense, anyway. Cadence told me once that you often second-guess actions you take when you’re stressed… especially things to do with, er… relationships.”</p><p class="double">They sat there for a bit.</p><p class="double">“Tell you what,” he said, suddenly. “I’ll ask Twilight if we can have the Gala tickets next time. Have it to ourselves.”</p><p class="double">“Isn’t that terribly selfish?” Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">“Nah.” Spike shrugged. “Well, maybe a bit. But I <i>am</i> a dragon.”</p><p class="double">Rarity giggled.</p><p class="double">“The great dragon Spykoranuvellitar, no less!” Spike puffed out his chest, knowing full well that he looked absurd. “Who could begrudge two tickets for his hoard, especially since at the moment it consists of two autographed books, a piece of cheese, and a wind-up toaster?”</p><p class="double">“…pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Spike looked shifty. “If you’re a dragon, midnight snacking is kind of expensive.”</p><p class="double">This time Rarity’s giggles lasted longer, and she was smiling at the end of them. “Thank you, Spike. I feel better now.”</p><p class="double">“No problem.” Spike paused, wondering if he should risk bringing the matter up again. “Er… have you considered asking Princess Luna to help with that fear of yours?”</p><p class="double">“No, actually.” Rarity frowned. “That might be a good idea. Thank you for suggesting it, Spike.”</p><p class="double">“No problem,” he repeated.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.3</p><p class="double">“Girls?” Twilight said, and the five other Elements turned to her. “There’s somepony I’d like you to meet.”</p><p class="double">“Who is it?” Pinkie asked. “I like meeting new ponies!” She looked a bit dour for a second. “Especially since it’s been getting kinda rare…”</p><p class="double">By answer, Twilight stepped back from the door.</p><p class="double">“…hello,” Trixie said. “Tr- <i>I</i> understand that you are the Looping versions, then?”</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Applejack replied simply.</p><p class="double">“Then it is nice to meet you.” Trixie sketched a bow. “I understand that my… well, my <i>normal</i> self has acquitted herself less than well on a few occasions with you.”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much.” Dash nodded. “Does this mean you’re Looping too?”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded, looking nervous. But she swallowed hard, and stood tall.</p><p class="double">Suddenly Applejack stepped forwards and took her hoof. “Then it’s nice to meet y’all. How long you been Loopin’?”</p><p class="double">“Oh. Er… only four so far.” Trixie waved a hoof. “I’m still rather new to all this.”</p><p class="double">“Full barrage, party close, immediate effect!” Pinkie said into a radio, and dove for cover.</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked. “What-”</p><p class="double">SPLUT.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Trixie does not even particularly like lime,” the unicorn said, treading icing. “What just happened?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Twilight shrugged. “I think Pinkie set up an autoloading party howitzer with voice activation earlier today. I don’t know why.”</p><p class="double">“Can you please teach Trixie two things?” At Twilight’s nod, Trixie continued. “First, that icing-walking spell you are using. It would be most useful.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Twilight nodded, hoisting the magician out of the impromptu torte. “And the second thing?”</p><p class="double">“How to subscribe to that party pony’s news letter.” Trixie’s eyes shone suddenly. “She thinks in a way that I find <i>very</i> interesting.”</p><p class="double">“…what have I done?” Twilight asked rhetorically.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.4</p><p class="double">“So, let me get this straight,” Spike said carefully. “I’m a pathetic excuse for a dragon because I was raised by ponies. Specifically, by a ‘namby pamby pony princess’.”</p><p class="double">Garble and his two bookends nodded.</p><p class="double">“Right. And you don’t know what kind of dragon I am?”</p><p class="double">“Like it matters!” the one on the left said. (Spike still couldn’t really tell them apart.)</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Spike nodded. “Got it. So, what’s your special power?”</p><p class="double">“Huh?” Garble said. “Why would we need <i>special</i> powers? We’re already, you know, <i>dragons</i>. Is this some pony thing?”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Spike shrugged. “’cause one of the namby pamby pony princesses I know kinda helped to raise me. And she taught me three main things. Number one: how to read.”</p><p class="double">The teens looked singularly unimpressed.</p><p class="double">“Number two, how to make friends.”</p><p class="double">If anything, they got more apathetic.</p><p class="double">“And number three: How to do this.”</p><p class="double">Spike stretched, and went on stretching. There was a brief period of morphic confusion, and then he tapped a claw on the ground.</p><p class="double"><i>Boom. Boom. Boom.</i></p><p class="double">“Kinda cool, huh?” he rumbled, now at least Wyrm in size.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna opened her door. “Whom is knocking at this late hour?”</p><p class="double">Three dragons prostrated themselves on the floor in front of her door. “Teach us awesome stuff, pony princess!”</p><p class="double">She blinked. “…very well, then. You shall be inducted into my Night Guards, and thence be taught the ancient power of balefire. The flame that burns cold.”</p><p class="double">Meadowlark grinned beneath his wing. He’d just been thinking the Night Guard needed a bit more… oomph.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.5</p><p class="double">“…I can’t run this!” Diamond Tiara shouted. “It’s inconceivable! Incomprehensible!”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Scootaloo asked. “It’s what happened.”</p><p class="double">“That’s as may be…” Diamond said, sighing. “But it would destroy the credibility of the paper if we printed it without evidence.”</p><p class="double">“We have credibility?” Sweetie asked.</p><p class="double">“Sssh,” Applebloom admonished her.</p><p class="double">“Ah well. I suppose we have a civic duty.” Diamond slid the copy over to the typesetter.</p><p class="double">“…pardon?” that colt asked, looking at the paper. “Princess Luna is the one ambushing ponies with tennis balls?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Scootaloo said, shrugging. “I didn’t have time to take a photo before she saw me, though.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna grinned as she read the headline.</p><p class="double"><i>Luna-tic Princess?</i></p><p class="double">“Ah, I do so enjoy creating bizarre headlines… let’s see, what next?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia spat her tea out.</p><p class="double"><i>Moon used for advertisement! Is the Princess of the Night hard up for cash?</i></p><p class="double">She ran to the window and looked out. The slowly sinking satellite had the words <i>Eat at Joe’s!</i> written across it.</p><p class="double">“…hm. Well, not my problem.” Celestia firmly put a lid on the issue, and decided to leave things to Luna.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Local pony breaks sound barrier!</i></p><p class="double">“That’s not a headline…” Twilight muttered. Then she read further.</p><p class="double"><i>No, seriously, we mean she broke it. As in, nothing has gone supersonic since.</i></p><p class="double">“But…” the anchor blinked. “How? She’s not even Looping!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Pinkie Pie declares independence, establishes republic of Sugaria</i></p><p class="double"><i>Guard captain caught with Celestia’s niece!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Luna rules, Celestia drools!</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Explain,” Twilight said flatly.</p><p class="double">“Alright…” Luna blushed. “I may have started bribing them.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.6 (The Bill, perhaps?)</p><p class="double">“…I don’t believe that scum like you could possibly exist! To betray your people, your family… you make me sick, and if I was the one in charge of sentencing you I’d have you in a hole so deep you’d have to tunnel <i>up</i> to Tartarus!”</p><p class="double">Someone knocked on the door.</p><p class="double">Inspector Dash stopped shouting, and moved away from the relieved criminal. “Ah, my shift’s up. I’ll get my partner to chat to you.” The door opened, and Dash slipped out.</p><p class="double">Inspector Gilda came in. “Yeah, Dash can be like that.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I see!” The unicorn grinned. “This is good cop, bad cop! Well, it ain’t going to work!”</p><p class="double">Gilda grinned. “Yeah, you got it right. Except for one thing… Dash always was a softy.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn paled.</p><p class="double">“Yep. She was the good cop.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Now that’s professional,” Twilight said critically. “No marks – not even real injuries – just a shave. And he did need one.”</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Dash replied, sitting down in the interrogation room. “Gils is <i>good</i> with those claws. Hell, I’ve seen her cut a feather in half – while it was falling.”</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Twilight held up a hoof. “…aaand he’s confessing. How long was that?”</p><p class="double">“Four minutes, seven seconds.”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Chief Twilight Sparkle wrote it down. “Unusually resilient one, that one…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.7</p><p class="double">“Hey, this is cool!” the alliteratively named Princess Pinkie Pie said, gazing around. “Discord’s in charge, right?”</p><p class="double">“Right now, yes.” Twilight nodded. “This is the Discordian era. I’m surprised your one of these got deferred by one loop, actually – probably it was because of that nice colt who Fluttershy helped. You know, the guy from Fenris.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” Pinkie nodded back. “Lemon Rush was so nice – well, except when someone threatened Fluttershy, anyway. So what happens now?”</p><p class="double">“Basically, we seal Discord and run Equestria.” Twilight frowned. “Which Elements do you want?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is the best job <i>ever!</i>” Pinkie said, beaming. “Where’d you get the idea of a Quaestor, anyway?” The brightly coloured robes shifted a little.</p><p class="double">“Rome,” Twilight replied. “I knew you’d enjoy that kind of thing, so I made it so there’s no weekends. Just about a hundred and eighty celebration days a year.”</p><p class="double">“All individually themed?” Pinkie’s eyes shone.</p><p class="double">“I certainly tried.” Twilight smiled, enjoying Pinkie’s obvious enjoyment of her new position. It had been tricky to work out how to divide their responsibilities, but this seemed to be working out fine.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, Pinkie…” Twilight rubbed her temples. “What have we learned?”</p><p class="double">“Uhhh… oh! Mortals can’t cope with a blood sugar level in excess of eighty percent!” Pinkie said brightly.</p><p class="double">“…Okay, what things, plural, have we learned?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie frowned. “Don’t try to summon a daemonette outside the forty-kay loop, cuz it doesn’t work and I don’t run them any more. Don’t invite crocodiles to parties, at least not adult ones. And don’t bake a special caramel cake shaped like floor and then startle the dragon ambassador with a bursting-paper-bag gag, cuz if he breaths fire then the whole thing explodes.”</p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight nodded. “That’s better. Now, I have to say, this <i>is</i> a new one on me for these Loops.”</p><p class="double">Both of them turned to look at Equestria below.</p><p class="double">“How long until the Elements let us go back down?” Pinkie asked.</p><p class="double">“Not sure.” Twilight shrugged. “I hope they can handle themselves down there.”</p><p class="double">She had to wonder why she’d been included in the lock out. Possibly it was because of the botched and overpowered daemonette summoning, which had instead finally produced a very confused Changeling in the instant before the explosion.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…okay, then.” Chrysalis looked around the smouldering crater. “Hmm… I wonder how much gratitude ponies would have for a nation of changelings that helped them rebuild their capital city?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“We’re back!” Pinkie shouted. “Now, who wants some chocolate?”</p><p class="double">“Me, please.” A Changeling hovered over and took one. “Very nice. Thank you.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked, watching the insectoid critter buzz off and go into a furniture shop. “What happened while we were gone?”</p><p class="double">“I dunno, but I like it!” Pinkie bounced into the air and stayed there, beating her wings. “Hey, look, free daily concerts!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, those must be so that Changelings can get their fill of love,” Twilight realized. “Well, we seem kind of superfluous. Shall we just go to the concert?”</p><p class="double">“Yay!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Should have known,” Twilight muttered to herself.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash worked their bass and guitar respectively on stage. Applejack drummed away in the background, Rarity was doing rather well on piano, and as for the singers…</p><p class="double">“<i>I&#039;ll give you all I&#039;ve got to give </i></p><p class="double"><i>If you say you love me too </i></p><p class="double"><i>I may not have a lot to give </i></p><p class="double"><i>But what I&#039;ve got I&#039;ll give to you </i></p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t care too much for money </i></p><p class="double"><i>For money can&#039;t buy me love </i></p><p class="double"><i>Can&#039;t buy me love </i></p><p class="double"><i>Everybody tells me so </i></p><p class="double"><i>Can&#039;t buy me love </i></p><p class="double"><i>No, no, no, no!”</i></p><p class="double">Celestia and Luna sang together, trading off on alternate lines with the ease of long practice and longer association.</p><p class="double">“They’re really good!” Pinkie enthused.</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Twilight said, nodding along. “Wonder if they’re going to even need the Elements…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.8</p><p class="double">Hiccup looked around. “Toothless? Where did you go?” <i>Seriously,</i> he added over their telepathic link – courtesy of a Pern loop so long ago it felt like they’d never lacked that closer-than-brothers relationship, <i>what happened to you?</i></p><p class="double">A purr came over the link, and a side-bleed of the dragon’s emotions. They were so strong – and so sleepy – that Hiccup nearly tripped.</p><p class="double"><i>Hey, Hiccup,</i> Toothless eventually said, in the telepathic equivalent of a lazy drawl, <i>I defect. I’m working for this girl now.</i></p><p class="double">Hiccup finally reached the clearing he’d originally met Toothless in – all those loops ago. However, there was a girl there already with flowers in her hair… and a rather grumpy looking bunny on her shoulder. And she was scratching Toothless under his chin.</p><p class="double">“You’re a nice one, aren’t you? So this is your home loop?”</p><p class="double">Toothless nodded happily, begging for more scratches.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You must be Fluttershy, then?” Hiccup confirmed. “It’s been… whoo, a <i>long</i> time since I last met you guys. Bit more experience with the multiverse since?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, thanks.” Fluttershy Hofferson stroked Angel Bunny, who waved a carrot warningly at Toothless when he tried to sidle closer. “Twilight told us she met you a few times.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” Hiccup shrugged. “Strange thing, she tends to be my sister. Anyway, you seem to have subverted my dragon.”</p><p class="double"><i>I’m not yours!</i> Toothless replied huffily. <i>We have a contractual relationship, remember. And there’s nothing in there precluding additional riders.</i></p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah…” Hiccup said, stretching. “Man, I’ll miss Astrid, though. She’s a good girlfriend… if scary.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy giggled. “All right. This is your home loop, so how does it work?”</p><p class="double">“Basically, we have to teach the village how to become dragon riders. Step one: catch your dragon.” Hiccup nodded towards Toothless. “As I’m sure you’ve noticed, they’re suckers for fish, catnip, scritches or just generally anything that works on a cat. Or a dog.”</p><p class="double"><i>I prefer to think of it as cats liking what Night Furies do.</i> Toothless rolled over on his back. <i>Speaking of which…</i></p><p class="double">Hiccup got up and gave his friend a rub. “They <i>are</i> kinda high maintenance at times, but if you get a dragon as a friend they’ll last you as long as you deserve. Longer, even.”</p><p class="double">“Okay…” Fluttershy got a speculative look in her eye. “I’ll see if I can find a dragon to befriend for myself.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Should have guessed…” Hiccup shook his head, as the humanized pegasus gave a chin scratch to the latest in a relay of over four hundred dragons.</p><p class="double">One of the nadders tried to jump the queue, and an expertly aimed carrot from Angel sent him sprawling backwards to meekly retake his place.</p><p class="double">“This is going to look bad at the exam…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hi, I’m Astrid. The name means beautiful, which I am, and these are my animal friends.” The pegasus gave a sweet smile. “They like me.”</p><p class="double">Stormfly nodded enthusiastically. The manticore, hydra, cockatrice and ursa major exchanged glances, felt their bruises and decided to play along.</p><p class="double">“…well, that suggests a way of dealing with Nightmare Moon,” Twilight said. “Er… what’s with the axe?”</p><p class="double">“It helps me be friendly,” Astrid said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.9</p><p class="double">“Twilight.”</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped into the audience chamber, half her mind on what she planned to do to handle Sombra this time around. The idea of getting him into an eating contest with Spike seemed to be a fun one…</p><p class="double">Celestia looked her in the eye. “Twilight Sparkle. You are to take your friends, the Elements, your brother, his wife, my sister, half the army, as many large monsters as you can obtain, and Trixie Lulamoon, and beat self-styled King Sombra like a test your strength machine.”</p><p class="double">The anchor’s thoughts swerved wildly, as Celestia went off-script. “Er… pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Did I stutter?” Celestia frowned. “No, you’re right. Also take the Wonderbolts, a regiment of expeditionary forces from the Griffins, every dragon we have treaties with and, if necessary or desired, an asteroid strike.”</p><p class="double">“…wait, are you Looping?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Celestia looked grave for a moment. Then sniggered. After a game attempt to recover her composure, she finally burst out laughing. “Got you!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, a grin stealing over it. “You did that.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.10 (C.S.) (by Zulaq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was another regular base loop for Twilight, and she was playing it as the first time, because she had a new plan in mind for dealing with Discord. She had just finished finding the information on Nightmare Moon’s imminent return and sending her letter to Celestia.</p><p class="double">5…4…3…2…1…</p><p class="double">Spike burped up a scroll.</p><p class="double">Twilight listened with only half an ear as Spike started reading, “My dearest, most faithful student Twilight, please come to my chambers immediately.” Spike dropped the letter with a gasp, “Wow, she must be really concerned about this Mare in the Moon thing. Don’t you think Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight didn’t respond, as she thought about what the summons meant. If Celestia was awake then she’d have to change some of her plans, but then again, loops with just her and the princess could be fun. Turning to Spike, she spoke, “Don’t worry, Spike. I’m sure the princess is just wants to confirm my findings. I’ll go see her right away.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Wait,” Twilight asked incredulously, “you’re telling me somepony’s stolen the Moon!?”</p><p class="double">Celestia definitely wasn’t awake, but Twilight had no clue what was going on. Maybe Luna was awake, and was messing with her sister again?</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Celestia stated gravely, “Two hours ago, I noticed was no longer under my power. I attempted to ascertain its status, and my spells say it’s not where it should be. The only clue that came up was this.” She lifted green metal curved band, with seven spikes jutting out of it.</p><p class="double">Curious, Twilight used her magic to bring the object to her for a closer examination. “It appears to be a tiara. Albeit, a rather uncomfortable one,” she mused, “It’s made of copper, the green is just oxidation. This definitely reminds me of something. But what?” She thought for a moment, before her eyes widened in realization, “It’s a miniature of the crown on top of the Statue of Leighberty in Manehatten!”</p><p class="double">Celestia looks relived for a moment, before donning a resolute face. “Twilight, I want you to go to Manehatten and investigate the Statue of Leighberty. Hopefully, you’ll be able to find some more clues there.”</p><p class="double">“Wait a minute,” Twilight protested, “Shouldn’t the guards handle this, maybe the police? Or even you, I mean whoever did this was strong enough to steal the moon!”</p><p class="double">“I’m afraid that won’t work,” Celestia sighed, “I cannot inform anypony else. If the people were to learn that the moon is missing, panic might ensue. I cannot go myself, because I’d attract far too much attention, and arranging royal visits is an extremely involved process that we just don’t have the time for.” She sighed again, “Fortunately, even though it’s not the longest day of the year yet, days are still far longer than normal this time of year, so it’ll be most of the day before I have to raise the moon. I might be able to buy some more time, pretend I’m keeping the sun up a bit longer than normal due to some unusual solar activity I want to observe, or some such, but I have to be here in Canterlot to do it.”</p><p class="double">“I guess I understand,” Twilight replied, “But how am I going to get to Manehatten in time?”</p><p class="double">“I’m going to teleport you there directly,” Celestia stated, with her horn beginning to glow, “So good luck, Twilight Sparkle!”</p><p class="double">In a flash of light, Twilight disappeared.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle appeared in a burst of light and shook her head. That was <i>not</i> a normal teleport, she thought to herself. It felt almost as if moving through a tunnel, which had screens on it showing various scenes from around Equestria, instead of the instantaneous transportation she was used to.</p><p class="double">But Twilight had no time to contemplate the strange teleport, as the scene before her stunned her. She was standing at the base of the Statue of Leighberty, and far above her, she can see twelve grey and red pegasi securing ropes to the crown atop the statue’s head. Quick to act, Twilight teleported herself to the statue’s head herself.</p><p class="double">Thankfully, teleporting under her own power seemed normal, and Twilight arrived only to find an even stranger scene than she thought. The twelve pegasi were still fliting about, attaching ropes, but there were also five other ponies on the roof. Four were grey and red unicorns, using magic to cut the metal of the tiara away from the rest of the statue using magic. But the fifth was the strangest, a mare wearing a huge red fedora, a long yellow scarf and a red greatcoat, which covered almost all of her body aside from her head and long black mane. Twilight wasn’t certain what type of pony she was, given her clothes covered up the areas where wings or a horn might be.</p><p class="double">The strangely dressed mare was the first to notice Twilight’s presence. She turned to face Twilight, and smiled. “So the Princess figured out my clue did she?” she spoke, with a faint smile on her face, “But then again, it was such a simple clue. And who does she send as her emissary?” She examined Twilight with a simple, dismissive, glance. “Obviously nopony of import.”</p><p class="double">“Hey,” Twilight protested, feeling odd that she’d been so causally dismissed, “I’ll have you know that I’m Celestia’s personal student! And I was the one who figured out your clue.” Twilight reigned herself in a bit, it wouldn’t do to get worked up on a mission like this. “Who are you? And why did you steal the Moon?”</p><p class="double">“Oh,” the mare questioned in an amused manner, “we might have a little detective here, asking so many questions. I’m sorry I won’t answer your questions yet, but you’re not quite the detective I want. So what do you say that you return to Celestia, and I continue my little plan.”</p><p class="double">“I’m not going anywhere! You’re going to stop this, and return the Moon, right now! Or else!”</p><p class="double">“Or else what my dear?” the mare questioned, “You’re still a child compared to me.”</p><p class="double">“Or this!” with that, Twilight shot a beam of stunning magic from her horn, but the strange mare merely sidestepped it.</p><p class="double">“Oh, so you do have some spark,” the mare chuckled to herself, “But I don’t have the time to spend playing games with you. After all, I do believe I’m done here.” As she spoke, a loud metallic groaning sound erupted from the statue, as the unicorns finished detaching the tiara and the pegasai began lifting it into the air.</p><p class="double">The unknown mare lifted her right forehoof, and Twilight could just see some sort of advanced bracer just under the edge of her coat. The mare pointed her hoof at the flying tiara, and a grappling hook shot out of the bracer and began pulling her up into the air. She twisted about to speak to Twilight once more, “We shall see if you are a good enough detective to challenge me, Twilight Sparkle. So I give you this clue; apples to apples, I think I’ll just take a chip off of the old block.”</p><p class="double">Twilight was stupefied by the scene before her. There was no way that a dozen pegasai could lift something as heavy as the tiara, but they were not only lifting it, they were flying at a decent pace, and only getting faster as she watched. She watched as the group of criminal ponies disappeared into the distance, and all she did was shake her head.</p><p class="double">Twilight knew that there were literally dozens of things she could have done to change the situation, but the sheer audacity (and implausibility) of the crime being committed had her off balance. Even now, she could probably magic up some solution, but instead, Twilight broke out into a grin. This just might be an <i>interesting</i> loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.11 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Macintosh sighed.</p><p class="double">It was the day of the Apple Family Reunion. The one where he&#039;d first seen Twilight Sparkle. All around him, he could see the other Apples doing reunion things, at this stage mostly standing around and sipping cider saved for the occasion. From over by the buffet table, the Element of Honesty took a moment from helping Granny Smith with the salad to give him a look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039; okay Mac? Ye&#039;ve done nuthin&#039; but mope since breakfast.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh paused. This was the other mare, the one that was sometimes there instead of the Applejack he had watched grow countless times before. She hadn&#039;t said as much, but the signs were there. She carried herself differently. Subtle motions. She&#039;d sometimes flex her shoulders like he&#039;d seen pegasi do. Her stepping was more careful, calculated. After years and years being around his sister, it had put him on edge. Acting and lying were different things, and she was better at the former than the latter, but an astute observer could pick it out if they tried.</p><p class="double">After so much time, small things were bound to change. He supposed somepony looking at him might see similar differences between his Looping self and his counterpart. On the other hoof, he&#039;d spent most of his Loops hiding from one pony or another, which might have masked the tells. He wasn&#039;t sure. All he knew for sure was that it was his effects, how he&#039;d changed the ponies around him, rather than anything he&#039;d been directly observed doing, that had finally tipped Her off.</p><p class="double">Of course, now he knew that Twilight Sparkle was just the victim of boredom and a mischievous demeanour, not an evil dusk-bringing eldritch abomination. He didn&#039;t really approve of the pranks. One had nearly given that loop&#039;s version of Granny Smith a heart attack when she&#039;d noticed. Even if she still would have been there next time the world reset, she was still his grandmother. Watching her die would still have hurt. It would have hurt his sisters too.</p><p class="double">He sighed again. He didn&#039;t want to keep this secret any longer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;ve got somethin&#039; to tell ya.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The barn, cleared to accommodate the festivities in case of rain, had proved the perfect place to explain things.</p><p class="double">&quot;So ye&#039;ve been loopin&#039; for a while now, but Twilight only noticed when ya changed enough stuff?&quot;</p><p class="double">It had been so easy this time. Instead of cutting him off at the first mention of time travel, like Applejack had in loops past, she&#039;d listened. Right up until he&#039;d mentioned she had been there for some of those loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">She seemed angry now. Ranting full blast.</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; ya didn&#039;t tell her about the loops &#039;cuz she turned into Eternal Twilight right in fronta ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">It felt good, in a strange way. Calling him out on stuff he&#039;d been hiding was something his sister did.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked him in the eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;And ya kept me in th&#039; dark, not trustin&#039; yer own kin ta have yer best interests at heart?&quot;</p><p class="double">He shook his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah told ya a few times, in some of th&#039; early loops. Y&#039; either didn&#039;t believe me, or ya wanted to go ta Twilight immediate like. Ah managed to convince ya that was a bad idea. Didn&#039;t feel lahk it were safe after thatn&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">The green orbs staring into his narrowed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know that&#039;s different. That weren&#039;t the loopin&#039; me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See, that&#039;s the thing.” Mac groped for words. “Y&#039;all aren&#039;t the sister ah know. Ya got her body, ya got her voice, ya got her eyes. But y&#039; ain&#039;t the same pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">A stomp of anger. Frustration. So very like Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;That didn&#039;t stop me from bein&#039; yer sister before! What about when ah went off to Manehatten, ah wasn&#039;t the same pony when ah came back!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039; didn&#039;t start hangin&#039; out with Eternal Twilight an&#039; turnin&#039; into no goddess after y&#039; went off to Manehatten! Fer all ah knew, y&#039; were some time warpin&#039; changeling in league with th&#039; eldritch abomination!&quot; Mac realized his voice was riding, and tried to calm down a little.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight&#039;s no abomination!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AH KNOW THAT NOW!&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence fell.</p><p class="double">It was broken by the receding clatter of tiny hooves outside the barn door.</p><p class="double">Instinctively, his eyes shifted to the red barrier. Applebloom. Ah, Fewmets.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, horseapples.&quot;</p><p class="double">The whisper was quiet, and likely meant for no ears aside from hers. His eyes widened.</p><p class="double">When he looked back at his sister, she was scowling at him. She spoke, barely louder than her swear.</p><p class="double">&quot;How many?&quot;</p><p class="double">He tilted his head. How many what?</p><p class="double">&quot;How many loops did y&#039;all lie to me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Recognition dawned at his eyes, but he kept his reply quiet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Four.&quot;</p><p class="double">She paused for a second before continuing.</p><p class="double">&quot;We ain&#039;t done mister. Ah got a shindig to run, an&#039; you&#039;ve got duties to attend, but after that, we&#039;re settlin&#039; this.&quot;</p><p class="double">She trotted out to find Applebloom, leaving Macintosh alone in the barn. He sighed, before quirking the corners of his mouth just a little. It would be hard, but he would try his hardest to fix things. After a minute or so, he followed his sister.</p><p class="double">It would be a good reunion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.12 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I know who you are. You&#039;re the Mare in the Moon – Nightmare Moon!&quot;Twilight exclaimed, focussing most of her attention on quietly completing a dimensional ward spell to cover the entire area around the town hall.</p><p class="double">The wicked mare of darkness (TM) gloated. &quot;Well well well, somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I&#039;m here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight put on a bored expression and spooled a hoof. &quot;Yeah, I know eternal night, never see the sun again, yadayadayada. I still think it&#039;s one of the most moronic villainous plots ever.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How dare you mock me!&quot; Nightmare Moon crackled with lightning, and her aura flared. &quot;I have all the powers of the night!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I have a Jim.&quot; Twilight returned.</p><p class="double">&quot;No amount of physical exercise will save you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not gym. Jim. JIM!&quot; the last was called out in a loud voice.</p><p class="double">A big grey hand came smashing through the wall behind Nightmare Moon and grabbed her. &quot;Pretty Pony Princess!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Arrrghh! You have a cave troll?&quot; NMM squirmed in the grip of the massive grey slab of humanoid, who was hugging her and saying how he would cuddle her and call her George.</p><p class="double">&quot;I promised him a pretty pony princess of his very own. Good luck escaping, cave trolls are highly resistant to magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Urh! Little foal, I can simply...&quot; Her aura flared and nothing happened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, so <i>that&#039;s</i> where I put that area ward against dimensional travel. Kinda knocks over your ability to teleport or turn ethereal. Ooops!&quot; Twilight smirked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">18.13</p><p class="double">“Lady Rarity, bearer of the Element of Generosity, of Ponyville! Mister Spykoranuvellitar, of Canterlot.”</p><p class="double">A few heads turned as the dragon and the unicorn entered Canterlot Castle’s largest dance hall, but most of the guests were otherwise occupied. The Gala was <i>the</i> premier social event… though that also made it where everyone checked their current score in the great game of status. And a fair fraction of the nobility of Equestria were engrossed in trying to calculate the current leaderboard.</p><p class="double">“<i>Of</i> Ponyville?” Rarity asked in an artfully concealed whisper, her lips barely moving. “And I wasn’t aware I was a <i>lady.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well, normally you’re not.” Spike’s whisper had a little less skill behind it, but ponies would have a lot less opportunity to learn to lip-read dragons anyway. “I asked Celestia about it, and she agreed to grant that title to element bearers as a minor mark of respect. And the ‘of’ is just where you live, when you have a title like that. For me it’s where I was born.” He looked around the room. “My, all the notables are here.”</p><p class="double">“How cunning of you,” Rarity said, then broke off their conversation. “Oh, Rich! Fancy seeing you here!”</p><p class="double">“Rarity.” Filthy Rich bowed gently, his eyes flicking to Spike. “And Spykoran as well. You’re certainly dressed for it.”</p><p class="double">Rarity made an elegant gesture in token of disagreement – which neither pony took seriously; it was just part of the way one did things. “One tries.”</p><p class="double">Spike let his own gaze wander to Rarity’s dress. They’d spent three days working together on it and on his tuxedo, and both were filigreed with gemstones ordered by refractive index. Light that struck them curved and came out somewhere else, splintered into a rainbow of colours, and the gems were so fine they looked like mere glitter unless seen closely.</p><p class="double">But to him, the real reason Rarity looked good wasn’t the dress. She made it look good, and not the other way around.</p><p class="double">“So, tell me,” Rich asked, addressing the dragon directly, “what <i>is</i> it like living with the highest-scoring graduate of Celestia’s academy in history?”</p><p class="double">Spike smiled slightly. “Well, she does her own taxes…” Rich quirked his mouth, and Spike went on. “She’s… brilliant, is the only word that applies. I’m probably something of a biased source, but I really don’t think the Element of Magic could have a better bearer.”</p><p class="double">“And, of course,” Rarity added, “you do help her out when she forgets to eat.”</p><p class="double">Spike raised a hand. “A touch, I do confess. Well, cooking is something I don’t mind doing – I even think I may have some skill at it, though being a dragon I can’t simply tell that from how my own creations taste.”</p><p class="double">Rich nodded understandingly. “What about…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The two of them spent about an hour doing a turn around the hall, engaging in dozens of short, varied conversations on a wide variety of topics. Their Looping experience served them well, letting either or both of them at least have a reference and a comment or two about nigh on any subject.</p><p class="double">Particularly interesting was when Princess Celestia managed to get a few minutes away from the receiving line and speak to them. Her knowing expression told Spike that she had at least some intimation of how close they were, but she confined herself to small talk… and one embarrassing story about the time when Equestria’s court including a dragon was still a cause of terror for ill-informed petitioners, leading to five ponies hiding behind a pillar from a two-year-old Spike with an ice cream.</p><p class="double">Ultimately, the music began. With no Pinkie Pie, the orchestra were able to perform a more normal set, and the first piece was a moderately paced quadrille.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Don’t look now,” Spike said quietly on their second dance (a slow waltz), “but I think that Blueblood’s been glaring at us for the past five minutes.”</p><p class="double">They slowly changed places, Rarity following the traditional dance and Spike moving in a variant that they’d worked out some time ago to compensate for his different body shape.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I see what you mean,” Rarity replied. “Goodness, but I feel rather better than I should about him being jealous of you.”</p><p class="double">“You think that’s what it is?”</p><p class="double">“For my sins,” Rarity gave a tiny grin, “I happen to know him rather well. I do feel some sympathy for the prince… after all, he’s grown up under rather a lot of pressure… but, then, other royals had the same situations and they handled it much better. But yes, that rather appears as though he’s jealous.”</p><p class="double">“With good reason,” Spike replied, executing a complicated step which had been designed with a low centre of gravity in mind. He managed it without stumbling, but it was a near thing. “I feel like I’ve got the best dance partner on the floor.”</p><p class="double">“You flatterer.” Rarity fluttered her eyelashes, eyes laughing. “I – oh!”</p><p class="double">The waltz had come to an end, and without missing a beat Octavia and her quartet changed into a fast arabesque.</p><p class="double">Spike and Rarity exchanged glances, grinned, and threw themselves into the physically demanding dance.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dragon and unicorn only came off the dance floor three times that night.</p><p class="double">The first time was when Rarity laughingly asked for a break, and the two of them headed over to the buffet for some food and – especially – water. Octavia was outdoing herself tonight, which meant lots of physically demanding dances, and they needed it.</p><p class="double">The second time, Spike disappeared backstage for a few minutes, and came out again onto the orchestral dais itself. Sitting at a piano, he proceeded to rattle off the hardest pieces Twilight had been able to find him – starting with a Bach piano concerto, following that up with the Hammerklavier, and finishing with something simply called “Study in A flat major after op.25” which was essentially written for four hands.</p><p class="double">Though that earned him a round of applause, he waved it off and vanished backstage again to change from waistcoat and tails back to his tuxedo.</p><p class="double">While he was gone, though, Rarity found herself approached by Blueblood.</p><p class="double">“Might I beg the honour of the next dance, my lady?” he asked, and Rarity had to admire his skill. If she hadn’t had several dozen loops’ worth of disastrous Gala attempts of one sort or another to remember, she’d have thought this was her dreams coming true.</p><p class="double">“My apologies, your highness,” she replied, affecting a slight air of distraction, “but I have already promised mister Spykoran the next dance.”</p><p class="double">“It rather seems as though you have promised him all the dances,” Blueblood muttered. “Though he is, it would appear, a lucky fellow – all our local mares are rather disquieted by your presence.” A dazzling smile. “They’re not used to competition, especially not competition with such grace.”</p><p class="double">“I would hardly describe myself as <i>competition</i>,” she began, and he interrupted her.</p><p class="double">“Nor would I, my lady… because that implies that they are within shouting distance of you.”</p><p class="double">“I really must get on.” Rarity turned half-away from him, looking to see if Spike had already come back in, and then saw a look of pure venom flash across Blueblood’s face before his training reasserted itself.</p><p class="double">She gave him a sardonic look which told him that she’d seen his momentary loss of composure. “Ah, dear Spykoran must have returned. Thank you for letting me know.”</p><p class="double">As Rarity trotted briskly over to the dance floor once more, she fancied – deep in her core – that she could hear the sound of grinding teeth.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Spike,” Rarity asked, halfway through the latest in a litany of dances so long she’d begun to lose track, “do you remember that letter you sent me, before our dinner at Blue Cordon’s restaurant?”</p><p class="double">“Er…” the dragon frowned. “The one last loop, about getting hold of lightsaber-quality crystals?”</p><p class="double">“No,” she shook her head. “The first one. That very first letter you sent me after we turned up in a Loop together.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Yes, I do.”</p><p class="double">“Well, by my count we have had approximately a hundred and eleven years to think about the subject,” she continued, still placing her hooves with faultless care. “And I would like to ask you if you think anything’s come up.”</p><p class="double">“…goodness.” The dragon thought for perhaps five seconds. “No, I can’t say I’ve noticed anything major… you’ve only improved, from the pony I first had a crush on.”</p><p class="double">“Good,” she said, and then as the waltz ended reached up, pulled his head down, and gave him a fiery kiss. “That’s about what I think, too,” she said softly, as her lips released his.</p><p class="double">Spike’s eyes were suddenly wet with unshed tears. “You… really?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” She winked, suddenly and irreverently. “It took me a long time to be sure, and I’m sorry for that. But I really have fallen for you.”</p><p class="double">Suddenly, both of them noticed that the sound in the room was ebbing away. Looking away from one another, they saw the various ponies present were clearing the dance floor.</p><p class="double">“Should we-”</p><p class="double">“Of course not,” Princess Celestia said, startling them both as she spoke from within a few metres. “This is yours, and yours alone.”</p><p class="double">With that, she withdrew, and Spike and Rarity were alone in the middle of a cleared space at least twenty metres in every direction.</p><p class="double">Then the musicians started playing again.</p><p class="double">It was concert music, not dance music, and as a general rule one simply did <i>not</i> start with a finale piece. But that didn’t matter. And as the finale of the <i>Rebirth of the Phoenix</i> began to swell around them, going from strings alone to horns to drums and flute, and swelling into one of the great triumphal musical pieces, the young-old dragon who was a mage’s assistant and the unicorn who had always dreamed of creating beauty simply <i>danced</i>.</p><p class="double">The third time they left the dance floor that night, no other pony replaced them. It would have been a cheapening of what they had just witnessed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So?” Twilight asked. “How did the Gala go?”</p><p class="double">Spike beamed. “As well as it possibly could have gone. Unquestionably,” and here he gave Twilight a wink, “the best night ever.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>19.1</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up at the refurbished castle with satisfaction. “Excellent. Well done, everypony.”</p><p class="double">AJ nodded. “Yep. A good day’s work, ah’d say.”</p><p class="double">The other four Element bearers lay around in various states of collapse. It had taken a twelve-hour-long burst of effort from all six of them to get the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters habitable, but it looked pretty good.</p><p class="double">“Right. Okay, everyone, take tomorrow off. Enjoy your new rooms,” Twilight continued briskly. “AJ, you can commute if you want, or move your family in – I don’t mind. But we’re going to want to get to work on the monitoring station soon.”</p><p class="double">“You know,” Dash wheezed, “This <i>can’t</i> be what Princess Celestia wanted you to do once we cured her sister.”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Twilight asked, frowning. “It’ll let us use the Elements on any villain who might threaten Equestria, it means we’re already in one place so there’s no need to waste time getting together, and it’ll let us detect when villains turn up in the first place.”</p><p class="double">“You think there might be any?” Rarity asked, pulling herself upright.</p><p class="double">“Probably.” Twilight shrugged.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Right. Trixie calls this meeting of the League of Minor Antagonists to order.”</p><p class="double">There was a hubbub of confused voices.</p><p class="double">“Trixie said <i>order!</i>” There was a loud bang. “Thank you. Now, Trixie is sure you are all wondering why you are here.”</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>duh,</i>” Gilda said scathingly. “None of us have ever met one another. Well, except me and Lighting Dust over there.”</p><p class="double">“It’s <i>Lightning!</i>” the pegasus snapped, stamping.</p><p class="double">“Who put po-ny in charge?” Fido asked.</p><p class="double">“Trixie did.” Trixie’s gaze swept the assembled ponies, griffin, Diamond Dogs, one confused buffalo, a large and irritable dragon, and Philomena the phoenix (wearing a name tag with the legend ‘observer’). “Trixie came up with the idea, recruited you all, and Trixie will be in charge.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” the dragon said, grumbling.</p><p class="double">Trixie erupted in blue light. “Really,” she said casually, as the corona of power revealed her wings. “Trixie said she was great. And powerful! You should take her at her word.”</p><p class="double">“What the buck?” Lightning Dust said, blinking. “You’re an <i>alicorn</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Trixie was sitting back down, light and wings gone and cloak firmly over her back. “Why? Did you see something?”</p><p class="double">“…oh, forget it.”</p><p class="double">“Trixie already has. Whatever it was.” The unicorn waved a hoof. “Now, our objective: the Elements of Harmony. Trixie recommends stage one should begin soon.”</p><p class="double">“What’s stage one?” Gilda asked.</p><p class="double">“Why, that’s simple.” Trixie grinned, activating a slide projector. “We place buckets of water over doors that they <i>tend to walk through.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Po-ny is clearly insane,” Fido muttered.</p><p class="double">The buffalo nodded, still wondering why he wasn’t in a desert any more.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.2</p><p class="double">“Okay, come on.” Spike stood, and gestured to his girlfriend – a word that still gave him a little frisson when he thought it. “We’re going flying.”</p><p class="double">Rarity flinched. “Do we have to?” she asked, covering for her slip.</p><p class="double">“Well, you don’t <i>have</i> to,” Spike admitted. “But I saw how you were last loop – don’t try and deny it, either. You really don’t like flying.”</p><p class="double">“I don’t, no.” That was no great secret. Luna hadn’t managed to do much more than deeply bury the fear in armour of ice, and while it didn’t paralyze her in terror… it was still obvious from the sheen of sweat that Rarity <i>did not like</i> flying.</p><p class="double">“Well… I dunno,” Spike shook his head. “You <i>earned</i> those wings of yours, Rarity, and I… I know what it’s like to hate your own body.”</p><p class="double">The dragon shook his head again. “But hate’s too strong a word. More like… dislike? Or just feel like you can’t bring yourself to use the full scope of its abilities? No, that’s not it either. It’s so hard to-”</p><p class="double">Rarity pressed a hoof against his lips. “I <i>do</i> know what you’re trying to say, Spike.” Then she chuckled. “Even if you’re not doing very well at saying it.”</p><p class="double">“I’m at a disadvantage!” Spike said. “There’s a hoof in my face.”</p><p class="double">“It wasn’t when you started talking, dear,” Rarity riposted.</p><p class="double">“Got any proof?” For a moment, the young dragon grinned wickedly. Then his face fell, as he remembered the topic.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Rarity nodded. It seemed like she was nodding half to herself. “Okay, you have a point. I’m an alicorn now – or I can be – and letting that go to waste would be simply atrocious.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Besides, I’ll be there.”</p><p class="double">“And I couldn’t ask for a better.” Rarity then giggled. “Oh, but I hope you’re going to age to the point you have wings! I’m <i>not</i> learning to fly while carrying you on my back!”</p><p class="double">The dragon frowned. “That’s a point. Actually… should we ask Dash to help? She’s the best flier we know.”</p><p class="double">“She is, yes…” Rarity considered. “No, I don’t think so. Dash finds flying far <i>too</i> easy. It’s first nature to her. If anything, my preference would be for Fluttershy – she’s by no means a natural flier, and she’s had to work at it.”</p><p class="double">“True. Shall I get her?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Spike blinked at how firmly Rarity had spoken, and she shook her head with a knowing grin. “Dear me, Spiky-wikey, you do miss the wood for the trees sometimes. You’re a great big strong dragon! I’d lay odds it was just as hard for you to learn as it was for Fluttershy to.”</p><p class="double">“Probably harder, you’re right.” Spike thought back. “Yes, it was hard enough for me to force myself into the air. But I still think we should get Fluttershy, because she’s the one who had to overcome a fear of flying.”</p><p class="double">“Next time,” Rarity decided, after a moment. “Unless this time goes well. But let’s see how we do alone together first.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Spike squared his shoulders. “Sounds good.”</p><p class="double">“And after this I’m going to get your adult form properly measured.” Rarity’s eyes took on what might be considered a slightly dangerous glint. “I won’t have you without a decent wardrobe, whatever your size!”</p><p class="double">“…we’re not going to be declaring war for the materials, are we?” Spike asked, with a crooked smile.</p><p class="double">“I swear!” Rarity quite deliberately flounced. “You invade another sovereign nation in the search for swatches <i>one</i> time, and you’re hearing about it forever!”</p><p class="double">That was good for a shared laugh.</p><p class="double">“Thanks, love,” Rarity said, quietly, after a minute or so of silence. “You’re right, I <i>do</i> need a kick up the backside about it. Sooner or later, there’ll be a loop where I <i>need</i> to fly.”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged awkwardly. “I kind of wanted to show you a few good romantic spots, too. Just the odd little place I like to go and meditate, but if we could both get there then they’d be perfect for a picnic.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, motivation…” Rarity looked off into the middle distance. “I look forward to it. Well, let’s go. Where do you suggest we start?”</p><p class="double">“Ponyville dam,” Spike replied promptly. “The lake’s a good safe splashdown spot, and hard flapping is at least a simple way to fly – you feel you’re in full control, and it lets you get that part of it down. Besides, your actual <i>skill</i> is good… it’s a psychological thing.”</p><p class="double">“Very well, then.” The unicorn summoned a swimsuit. “Nice day for a swim.”</p><p class="double">Spike blinked. “Are you trying to distract me? Because… it’s kind of working, actually…”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.3</p><p class="double">“I actually kinda wish <i>I</i> had a grandmother half as neat as yours,” Diamond Tiara said absently. “I mean, she got a land patent from Celestia herself!”</p><p class="double">“Always with th’ hob-nobbing fer you, ain’t it?” Applebloom shook her head. “And here ah thought you were gettin’ to appreciate commoners.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I do.” Diamond pointed over at Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle. “See? I appreciate them.”</p><p class="double">“Y’all <i>bribe</i> them.”</p><p class="double">“We are totally happy with that!” Scootaloo said, balancing an ice cream about the size of her leg. “Bribery is good!”</p><p class="double">“But as I was saying,” Diamond pressed, “I do appreciate commoners. But you, oh farmer’s daughter, are <i>yeomanry</i>.”</p><p class="double">“…what?” Applebloom blinked, trying to remember the meaning of the word. “Ain’t that the same thing?”</p><p class="double">“Not quite.” Diamond bestowed a disapproving look on her, with only a slight smirk to reveal she didn’t mean it. “Silver?”</p><p class="double">“It’s simple.” Silver Spoon pointed over at the distant orchard. “Basically, you own your own land – or, rather, your family does.”</p><p class="double">“...wait, that’s it?” Applebloom felt vaguely disappointed.</p><p class="double">“Well, yeomanry have other characteristics.” Diamond smiled beatifically. “Chief amongst them a stubbornness of truly gargantuan – neigh, epic – proportions. One that puts such little things as a thousand years on the moon into the shade.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom giggled. “Okay, you got me. But why does that make us yeomanry, instead of commoners?”</p><p class="double">“Basically…” Diamond looked a little embarrassed. “Actually, it’s because there used to be three kinds of ponies. Ones who had others work for them, ones who worked for themselves, and ones who worked for others. And most of the top lot didn’t care about the difference between the other two.”</p><p class="double">Then she made a throwing away gesture. “But who gives an apple. They’d consider Silver and I nouveau riche, you an uppity yeoman’s daughter and Scootaloo and Sweetie to be dreadfully common.”</p><p class="double">“So… what you’re saying is, none of it matters anyway,” Applebloom said slowly.</p><p class="double">“Yes, yes, but don’t expect that in writing.” Diamond frowned, then raised a hoof. “Idea! I give you poor, benighted provincials – and Silver, of course – a taste of true class.”</p><p class="double">“Which is?” Four voices said, not quite in chorus.</p><p class="double">“…hay if I know. As far as I can tell, though, class tastes like expensive chocolate. So that seems like a good start.” Diamond counted out bits. “Wow, I never realized just how <i>much</i> allowance I had… which way is Sugarcube Corner?”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.4</p><p class="double">“Okay, guys,” Sora said, summoning Fimbulwinter and Fafnir. The two keyblades crackled with frost and fire, and air began to swirl around him. “In fast, beat up Axel, then we can finally get our Gummi ship back this Loop.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha!” Donald quacked, his own legendary weapon snapping with power.</p><p class="double">He and Goofy fell in behind their Anchor, as he broke down the doors of Twilight Town’s old mansion.</p><p class="double">“GREETINGS!” a large, blue-black animal shouted. She (he?) reminded Sora of a cross between a unicorn, Hercules’ friendly pegasus… and Saix, somehow. “YOU WOULD BE THE DESTINED CHILD WHOSE MEMORIES WE HAD TO REBUILD IN THY DREAMS?”</p><p class="double">“Er… yeah?” Sora looked around, trying to spot something different. Nope, the mansion was the same as ever… but those winged-unicorn statues now looked kinda suspicious. “Where are you from?”</p><p class="double">“EQUESTRIA.” The… whatever-she-was said, lowering her voice enough that Sora could at least detect a gender. “NOW… WHERE IS THE NEAREST POOL? WE NEED A HOLIDAY.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Filling in for Auntie Luna suuucks,” Nyx grumbled. “Moon goes up, moon goes down. It’s <i>boring.</i> Hmmm… wonder if I could make it go… sideways?”</p><p class="double">Naminé shrugged. “I’m just grateful for the rest.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.5 (inspired by “New Recruits”, a picture by DMKruiz.)</p><p class="double">“Well, ah got to admit…” Applebloom walked around the first applicant. “She ain’t got a cutie mark.”</p><p class="double">“But she’s <i>way</i> too old.” Scootaloo carefully scrutinized the nervous applicant, who began to turn rather more annoyed. “Like… at least twenty.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I say we should take her.” Sweetie Belle nodded. “’Bloom? Scoots?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, sure.” Applebloom nodded as well, and after a moment Scootaloo made it unanimous.</p><p class="double">“Can you, er… transform smaller?” Sweetie asked, rummaging amongst their things. “We don’t have a large size cape.”</p><p class="double">“Fine.” Queen Chrysalis flashed with green fire and became much smaller. “This will do?”</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Applebloom answered.</p><p class="double">“As for the other one… hey, can you take off your armour? We need to see if you have a cutie mark.”</p><p class="double"><b>“Crys-tals!”</b> Sombra said, shocked.</p><p class="double">“No, I didn’t mean it like that!” Sweetie babbled, then blinked. “Wait. We don’t even <i>have</i> that kind of taboo.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“You think this stands the best chance of working?” Princess Celestia asked, watching as the Crusaders (three official, one probationary) chased Sombra around the meadow trying to get a look at his flank.</p><p class="double">“Well, it’s worth a try…” Twilight held up a book. “Apparently it’s called reintegration therapy.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.6 (Filraen, continuation of 17.3 take two)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">In Rainbow Dash&#039;s opinion, it was a pity they had to halt a great prank. Then again, giving a place of rest for other loopers was something Princess Celestia ordered to all of them and the pegasus agreed with the reasons. Explaining all of that to a non-Awoke Celestia, after she they had used their dark alicorn forms? Awkward.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Is that it?&quot; Celestia was very worried about this development. Was this a trick born for the darkness and corruption to make her let her guard down? She wasn&#039;t sure what she would do, alone or with the Day Guard as backup, against six alicorns in direct combat. Were they telling the truth? And what was the role of Discord, who was currently eating popcorn with Starlight Breaker, in all of this? She wasn&#039;t sure what option was the more terrifying one.</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I think we can offer some proof and fix everything at the same time,&quot; Twilight Sparkle said before looking back to the other ponies and nodding. Then all six of them changed into alicorns, finally seeing how the corruption took their forms. Fearing what she had really unleashed in Equestrie a cold sweat ran through Celestia when Eternal Twilight&#039;s horn started to shine and then she saw appearing... the Elements of Harmony!? How could they answer to anypony&#039;s call? After each alicorn wore an Element, Celestia saw how a rainbow-colored wave spread from the alicorns, warm to the touch, fixing the castle and clearing the sky.</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;So, how was it?&quot; Eternal Twilight said, in a voice not unlike Twilight Sparkle.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Celestia decided it was the best moment to faint.</i></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">But that didn&#039;t matter right now. She was back in Ponyville and taking care of the weaher as usual and with a new apprentice this loop she could have more time to nap which was always a good thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight told me you can control the weather, how does that work?&quot; Starlight... no, Nanoha asked. By some reason she didn&#039;t like to be called for her pony name.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we usually work in teams to move clouds and make different weather patterns. Do you see how I&#039;m standing -not flying- on a cloud right now?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked while stomping the cloud with one hoof for emphasis.</p><p class="double">Nanoha nodded, while hovering by the rainbow-maned pegasus side. She seemed extremely at ease in a pegasus body, Rainbow Dash noted, barely walking if she could fly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d normally start with you trying to stand on a cloud, but… you seem to have a good knack for flying.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just love flying, and having actual wings here is very interesting.&quot; Nanoha’s eyes sparkled.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can understand that, just tell me if you&#039;re getting too tired to take a rest.&quot; Rainbow Dash smiled. &quot;Time to practice: try to buck this cloud...&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twilight, can I borrow some parchment?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me see if there&#039;s some left around here.&quot; Twilight looked at the ruins of the library - the lack of walls giving a great vantage point to see the ruins of Ponyville. &quot;Here. What for, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I want to write a letter to Princess Celestia about what I&#039;ve learned this loop: never let Nanoha in the weather management team when there&#039;s a thunderstorm scheduled.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.7 (Madfish)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">The villagers of Ponyville were shocked. They&#039;d just seen a tripped, spun, slipped, inverted, flipped and finally netted Nightmare Moon – now hanging from the ceiling.</p><p class="double">Applejack turned to face the Mayor and coincidently the crowd she laid out the sequence of events.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s amazing… but if there&#039;s no Nightmare Moon who is that?&quot; asked the Mayor gesturing at the net.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity if yah would?&quot;</p><p class="double">With a beam of light from her horn the makeup removal spell washed over &#039;Nightmare Moon&#039; revealing-</p><p class="double">&quot;Royal Celebration Co-ordinator Twilight Sparkle!&quot; shouted an even more shocked crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;The one thing we didn&#039;t get was the &#039;why&#039;, Sugarcube,” Applejack said. “Why the whole Nightmare Moon scam? What did you gain by faking that Ponyville would hold the Summer Sun Celebration?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The five of you did pretty well,&quot; Twilight answered sounding rather unworried for a party wrecker in a net being stared at by a growling Pinkie Pie. “The part of the plan you failed to understand was that I moved every calendar in Ponyville forward a day and cast a spell to stop anypony noticing.”</p><p class="double">&quot;But why?&quot; pressed Big Macintosh Apple from where he&#039;d triggered the net.</p><p class="double">&quot;Simple. I needed to find a group of ponies to stop Nightmare Moon.&quot; Twilight nodded to herself absently.</p><p class="double">&quot;But, Darling, you&#039;re Nightmare Moon,” Rarity pointed out, gesturing to the costume wings that had fallen off at some point in the process.</p><p class="double">With a certain smugness Twilight finished filling in the gaps, &quot;Only for tonight. Tomorrow at the real celebration, which really is here by the way, the real Nightmare Moon will be freed and kidnap Celestia unless I can find a group of 6 Ponies like yourselves to stop her.”</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll forgive me darling if we&#039;re… sceptical.&quot; Rarity frowned uncertainly – it sounded a lot like Twilight was a few stitches short of a dress.</p><p class="double">&quot;No fur off my muzzle, I&#039;ve done my bit. You&#039;ve already got the book in the Library so tomorrow the six of you can go to the Old Palace and get them.&quot; Twilight kicked back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; said the mayor after a moment of silence, her voice firming &quot;take her away!&quot;</p><p class="double">As she was led out the door Twilight shouted back, &quot;And I’ve gotten away with it because of you Meddling Mares and your Studly Stallion!&quot; Then somewhat quieter with distance, &quot;Seriously! Studly! Call me some time!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.8 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Gentlemen, it appears one of the guests of honour is late, probably still caring for an injured animal, knowing her. She is a butter yellow pegasus with a pink wavy mane and tail. She is also rather timid, so I want you to treat her with the utmost courtesy and gentleness. I&#039;m sure you will do your duty in an exemplary fashion.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two guards standing in front of the entrance to Sugarcube Corner both nodded curtly.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around. She was not going to let this instance of the party slip into the sort of disaster that the original was. &quot;Rarity, how&#039;s the anti-mess spell holding up?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s marvellous, Twilight!&quot; The unicorn mare returned, enjoying the feast spread in front of her. &quot;I must put it on all of my dresses! Where did you find it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In an old book of household charms.&quot; Where she&#039;d written it after creating it from scratch over the last couple of loops. &quot;I don&#039;t see why you couldn&#039;t enchant it into one of the gems using a rune matrix to make it permanent. I&#039;ll draw something up for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, darling... Salad fork over there, soup before salad, Applejack,&quot; she said to the bewildered looking farm-mare alongside her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks kindly sugarcube, it&#039;s been a long time since I did this kind of fancy eating.&quot;</p><p class="double">Satisfied that they were both happy, Twilight checked on Pinkie Pie, just in time to divert a seven layer cake into the pink pony&#039;s trajectory and prevent her taking Princess Celestia&#039;s cake.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, sirs.&quot; Fluttershy&#039;s voice came from the door, and Twilight went over to intercept her.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m so glad you could make it. It wouldn&#039;t be the same without you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry I&#039;m late, I had to finish taking care of a patient first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled at her. &quot;It&#039;s okay, I thought it was something like that. Come on, I know the Princess is going to love you, and she&#039;s brought a her pet phoenix with her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes sparkled at the idea. &quot;Ohh!&quot;</p><p class="double">They came over just as Celestia finished tea trolling the Cakes. &quot;Princess, may I present my friend Fluttershy.&quot;</p><p class="double">The princess turned her gaze on the yellow pegasus. &quot;Ah yes. I understand from Twilight Sparkle&#039;s letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes, your highness, I love to take care of animals.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small. Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.&quot; The half-dead parrot in the cage next to her chose that moment to cough. &quot;Ah, Philomena, my pet. You&#039;re awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my...&quot; Fluttershy was as usual shocked to see the state of the pet. Twilight quickly stepped in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess? I didn&#039;t realise she was that close to a burning day. I guess you wouldn&#039;t want to leave her alone while she goes through it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Princess nodded. &quot;As you say, I wanted to be there for her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked confused. &quot;Um... what&#039;s a burning day? If you don&#039;t mind me asking...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight kicked in lecture mode 1. &quot;A phoenix is pretty much immortal, but they do it by regenerating every hundred years or so. When a burning day approaches, they start to moult and look ill, and eventually burst into flame and burn to ash.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seeing Fluttershy&#039;s horrified expression she quickly added. &quot;It&#039;s okay, they regenerate from the ashes into a younger version of themselves. It&#039;s just a part of their natural life-cycle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I hadn&#039;t realised you&#039;d studied phoenix life-cycles.&quot; Celestia said with a slightly surprised expression.</p><p class="double">&quot;I found a book on exotic creatures in Golden Oaks Library, and considering we&#039;re next to the Everfree...&quot;</p><p class="double">A Royal guard came up and whispered in the princess&#039;s ear. &quot;Really? Well, if I must... I&#039;m sorry, everypony. I&#039;m afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It&#039;s been a joy getting to know you all better.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh! Princess, before you go, do you mind if Fluttershy and I look after Philomena while you&#039;re at the meeting? I&#039;m sure Fluttershy would love to take care of her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t see why not.&quot; The Princess replied. &quot;Farewell, every-pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked wide eyed as the Princess left. &quot;Oh thank you Twilight! I&#039;ll take really good care of her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought you&#039;d enjoy it. I&#039;ll get that book.&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;Though really all we can do is make her comfortable until she burns up.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.9</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned into the camera. “Hello, and welcome to ‘Tough Science.’ I’m your host, Twilight Sparkle, and with me are Rainbow Dash and Trixie Lulamoon.”</p><p class="double">She then looked a bit nervous. “Actually, they kinda scare me…”</p><p class="double">“Come on, come on!” Trixie’s horn glowed, and the camera moved around to focus on her. “We’ve received many letters from all over Equestria, asking us important questions that must be answered for science. Dash! The first letter!”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Rainbow Dash lifted a letter from the pile. “This one’s from a little colt by the name of Pipsqueak, and he asks ‘is Luna best princess?’” Dash blinked. “Can we even…”</p><p class="double">Trixie shook her head. “A simple question, with two answers. The first answer is ‘of course not, that would be you, your highness’. And the second answer is ‘yes you are, please don’t hurt us Princess Luna.’ The answer depends who is asking.”</p><p class="double">“Isn’t that kind of… cynical?” Twilight asked from off camera.</p><p class="double">Trixie shrugged. “Next letter!”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Dash rummaged around. “Ooh, I like this one.”</p><p class="double">“Do tell.” The unicorn moved over to have a look.</p><p class="double">“’Dear Mythbuckers,’”… Trixie paused. “Twilight! Trixie <i>told</i> you that we should be called the Mythbuckers!”</p><p class="double">“They only call us that because you wrote the adverts and put that on them!” Twilight shouted back.</p><p class="double">“Talk to the hoof.” Trixie went back to the letter. “Hm. Apparently this pony is asking us how big a crater it would make if a barrel of rainbow extract were detonated.”</p><p class="double">“Actually, that’s interesting.” Twilight wheeled a blackboard in front of the camera, and started drawing. “You see, explosions going off in the air don’t tend to create a crater at all. They cause a lot of pressure wash, but no crater unless the fireball of the explosion itself hits the ground. If the explosive goes off on the ground, then it can make a crater, but the best thing to do for a really big one is to camouflet – that’s when the explosive goes off <i>under</i>ground.”</p><p class="double">“…thank you.” Trixie bucked the board back offscreen. “But who cares what the numbers say, we’re going to blow stuff up ourselves! Dash, where did you put that rainbow extract we… liberated?”</p><p class="double"> “You did what?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Forget you heard that!” Trixie then looked at the camera. “We can edit the incriminating statement out, right?”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Three, two, one…”</p><p class="double">The ground heaved up, and then it rained dirt onto the three ponies and their slit trench.</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Trixie said, surveying the crater almost as soon as turf had stopped landing. “At least twice as big!”</p><p class="double">“So, that’s the answer?” Dash asked. “I mean, we’ve done, like, ten tests by now.”</p><p class="double">“We have…” Trixie tapped a hoof on the ground. “But we did not test a detonation where the barrel of rainbow extract goes off next to <i>other</i> barrels of rainbow extract.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Oh, Celestia… I can’t tell which of you two corrupted the other, but it’s not making for quiet loops.”</p><p class="double">“Quiet is boring!” Trixie replied indignantly. “Besides, Trixie at least exercised discretion on the princess question. Clearly best princess is Trixie.”</p><p class="double">Dash and Twilight both looked peeved, but let it go. “Right.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“I would never even consider this were we not in a time loop,” Twilight said absently, lifting the last barrel onto their pile. “Right, what did we say minimum safe radius was?”</p><p class="double">“Trixie prefers to put it this way.” The unicorn made an expansive gesture. “Good thing we’re in the frozen north.”</p><p class="double">“True.” The unicorns fired off cloud-walking spells and then teleported to a cirrus forty miles away, and Dash lit the fuse before rocketing off into the air to join them.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“And there’s the answer,” Twilight said to camera. “With the right environment, a properly buried charge, and lots more rainbow extract, the resultant crater can be as large as half a mile. But don’t try this on your home planet unless you’re really careful.”</p><p class="double">She turned. “Isn’t that right, Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“Worth it!” Trixie shouted from the hospital bed.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “Anyway. If you’re doing these kinds of experiments, you really need to make sure you have as many magical precautions as you can – as well as non magical ones, too.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“So this is what you learned last Loop?” Celestia asked, as the video ended.</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” Twilight shrugged. “I’ve been kind of scraping the barrel for a while now… at least for lessons to learn with Trixie. With her, it tends to be ‘don’t use high explosives to make breakfast’.”</p><p class="double">The ground shook.</p><p class="double">“Speaking of which, I think she’s finished making the crumpets. Want one?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“I think I will pass, thank you,” Celestia replied solemnly. “And I fear for Equestria next time she’s in charge.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Actually, Trixie <i>is</i> fairly sweet… she’s just an adrenaline junkie. And you can’t talk, oh Princess Cowabunga.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.10</p><p class="double">“Oh, ah see!” Applejack said, noticing the small copse of apple trees. “Mah element must be manifestin’ as somethin’ like mah cutie mark!”</p><p class="double">Discord chuckled soundlessly. As he’d thought, the intricate maze he’d woven was convincing the Element bearers that he’d set up some kind of <i>test</i>.</p><p class="double">“Thought so!”</p><p class="double">Wait, what?</p><p class="double">Discord blinked, noticing that Applejack was now wearing her Element of Honesty.</p><p class="double">“Where did you even get that?” he asked, materializing with a whoosh.</p><p class="double">“Ah just did.” Applejack shrugged.</p><p class="double">Discord grit his teeth, as over on the other side of the maze Rarity’s element turned up out of nowhere.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. “This maze of yours isn’t doing too well, is it, Discord?”</p><p class="double">“Shut up!” he said petulantly. “And you don’t have your element, so there. A unicorn without a horn doesn’t have <i>any</i> magic, so you <i>can’t</i> deserve your element now!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, yeah, about that…” Twilight hefted a box from behind a hedge. “I found them.”</p><p class="double">Discord focused in on the box. It was a large crate, with a horn next to an “X 6” legend, and a wing next to an “X 12”.</p><p class="double">“But… I didn’t…”</p><p class="double">Twilight kicked the box, which fell open. There was a moment of confusion, and then all six Element bearers were alicorns.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Cool!” Pinkie said, looking herself over. “This is super amazing! Hey, Twilight, you got your groove back!”</p><p class="double">“My what?”</p><p class="double">“I mean… horn.” Pinkie pointed. “And element, too!”</p><p class="double">Discord’s jaw hung open. Then he knelt down in front of them. “You win. Teach me how to prank, you’re clearly better at it than I am.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Prank? I don’t know what you mean. But if we have won, mind putting everything back the way it was?”</p><p class="double">“Fine.” Discord snapped his claws.</p><p class="double">“No, not like <i>that</i>,” Twilight grinned. “Dear me, Discord. Evacuate the castle, and then restore it to how it was – in <i>your</i> time.”</p><p class="double">“There wasn’t a castle there in my time…” Discord said, then it dawned on him. “Oh, wow. You <i>are</i> good.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.11</p><p class="double">SCP-2314</p><p class="double"><b>Classification:</b> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Safe</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Euclid</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Keter</span> <u>Euclid</u></p><p class="double"><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b></p><p class="double">Since SCP-2314 possesses the ability to teleport with no known range limit, containment in a meaningful sense is effectively impossible. The approach taken at site-12 has been essentially one of psychological containment - SCP-2314 is made to be comfortable in the assigned containment room, and encouraged to stay.</p><p class="double">To this end, SCP-2314 is provided a large (10x10x5 m) main room, with access to separate lavatory facilities, and many of the same conveniences found in a normal suburban home. In addition, a discretionary fund has been set aside to keep SCP-2314 supplied with new books - SCP-2314’s voracity for the written word has proven amply sufficient to keep it content.</p><p class="double">Food is strictly vegetarian, but aside from this little different from human norms combined with standard equine preferences. (Note: apparently daisy sandwiches are considered a delicacy – possible reward?)</p><p class="double"><b>Description:</b></p><p class="double">SCP-2314 is an equine being, approximately five feet in length and four in height. Its coat is predominantly purple, with a striped mane (provenance of striping unknown and under investigation) and a small single horn in the middle of the forehead.</p><p class="double">SCP-2314 is female, professes to be fully mature, and is overall cooperative with investigations but projects an air of tolerant amusement. SCP-2314 has full understanding of and ability to speak English, though occasionally words are used which are alterations of English (for example, ‘beforehoof’ as opposed to ‘beforehand’). SCP-2314 refers to herself as “Twilight Sparkle”.</p><p class="double">In addition, SCP-2314 possesses abilities which are effectively consistent with those of reality warpers. Teleportation and telekinesis in particular have been noted, and it has been determined that SCP-2314’s horn glows when such an ability is being used. The reasons for this are not yet known, but SCP-2314 has little objection to subjecting to a variety of tests on these and other ‘magic’.</p><p class="double"><b>Addendum: </b></p><p class="double">SCP-2314 self-identifies as a unicorn, and it is recommended to use this term when referring to her species.</p><p class="double">Also, whoever classified her as Keter was an idiot. Yes, she can teleport. Yes, she’s intelligent. Yes, she sometimes seems to be smarter than we are (whoever gave her that book on quantum physics should take note of the annotations in the margins). But she shows neither attempts nor desire to break out of containment, and frankly I don’t see her doing anything particularly nasty if she DID leave. For goodness’ sake, she’s addicted to books. We could recontain her by staking out the nearest library.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Excerpt from interview SCP-2314-2:</b></p><p class="double">Interviewer: “So, you’re a… unicorn.”</p><p class="double">SCP-2314: “Yep.”</p><p class="double">Interviewer: “Where’d you come from?”</p><p class="double">SCP-2314: “Canterlot, originally. Sorry that’s not much help as an answer, but it’s the best one I’ve got. Perhaps we should focus more on my abilities?”</p><p class="double">Interviewer: “I’m asking the questions.”</p><p class="double">SCP-2314: “And I’m suggesting better ones. Hey, watch this!”</p><p class="double">*slight humming sound*</p><p class="double">Interviewer: “…why is the table glowing purple and floating?”</p><p class="double">SCP-2314: “Telekinesis. Cool, isn’t it?”</p><p class="double">Interviewer: “…I’ll be right back.”</p><p class="double">SCP-2314: “Okay! Be back soon!”</p><p class="double">From this it should be clear that SCP-2314 is both enthusiastic and does not stick to the script. A collegiate attitude is recommented.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight waved to the security cameras. “Morning!”</p><p class="double">It was an interesting experience, being the subject of study like this. It would be nicer if they’d just trust her enough to help with examining the <i>other</i> creatures or objects in containment, but a steady supply of books was good enough. (That and hearing them trying to work out how her magic operated. It was getting <i>so</i> tempting to just tell them, but it kind of felt like that would spoil it for them…)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.12</p><p class="double">The Nine Riders of the Nazgul rode out of Mordor. They crossed the Anduin by night, then reached the Fords of Isen on Midsummer’s Eve.</p><p class="double">And at that point, all nine horses blinked.</p><p class="double">“What the hay?” Twilight Sparkle asked, shrugging violently and throwing the Witch-King of Angmar off her back. “Where are we?”</p><p class="double">“I dunno!” Pinkie answered, shaking herself like a dog as Khamul the Easterling went flying.</p><p class="double">The other four Elements, Luna, Shining and Cadence kicked their respective burdens off with equal ease, the Nazgul not expecting their brutalized mounts to suddenly lose all fear of them.</p><p class="double">“Wait a second…” Shining frowned. “This is Arda. I remember reading the books.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right!” Twilight nodded, as the Nine began to get up. “Yeah, sorry, I was here once before but in a <i>completely</i> different place.”</p><p class="double">She then shot a look at the Witch-King. “And as for you, the prophecy only says no man can kill you. I’m a female unicorn. Sod off.”</p><p class="double">The Witch-King looked back and forth between the nine rebellious horses and his eight fellows. Then all the Nazgul drew morgul-steel.</p><p class="double">“Suit yourself. Elements, girls.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">The flash of rainbow light could be seen from Minas Tirith.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, what now?” Cadence asked, as Twilight (restored to her base form by the use of the Elements of Harmony) converted the remaining three black horses into unicorns or alicorns as appropriate.</p><p class="double">“Well… I guess Celestia must be here somewhere.” Twilight tapped a hoof. “Actually, she’s probably Shadowfax. After that… anyone fancy invading Mordor?”</p><p class="double">“What, just us?” Rarity asked, taken aback.</p><p class="double">“Nah, I bet Spike’s around somewhere.” Ignoring Rarity’s sudden blush, Twilight continued, “Dragons are powerful here, and I doubt Sauron would be too happy to be hit by the Elements regardless of that.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Denethor tapped the Palantír of Minas Tirith. “I swear, if this has broken…”</p><p class="double">The seeing stone persisted in showing a motley group of brightly coloured horses – some with wings, horns, or both – cantering east along the great road.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">19.13 (from Melavio)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity looked around as she Awoke, and noticed a few off things. First, she was in a castle that certainly was not the Royal Pony Sisters castle, nor was it Canterlot, nor even the capital of the Crystal Empire. Secondly, she was very much a human again. Lastly, and strangest yet, there was a candelabra and a clock that were currently conversing with her. They seem to be looking at her with varying expressions of worry and curiosity. Searching through her memories, Rarity noted that she was Rarity Belle and had come to this castle to beg for her father&#039;s release from the clutches of the evil Dragon.</p><p class="double">At least Spikey-Wikey was likely in the loop with her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! Mademoiselle, it is a pleasure to meet you! My name is Lumiére, and this square fellow of mine is Cogsworth,&quot; the candle holder noted, gesturing to his friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;A pleasure to meet you Mademoiselle,&quot; the clock stated before bowing.</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled and curtsied, &quot;Why thank you for the introductions, monsieur’s. My name is Rarity, and I&#039;m looking for the Dragon to release my father.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lumiere&#039;s smile faltered, &quot;Ah well, our Master is a bit temperamental, so let us go elsewhere first and-&quot; *WOOOSH* A large creature descended from the rafters and landed behind the two animated objects. Gulping, Lumiere and Cogsworth both turned around to find…their Master smiling tenderly?</p><p class="double">&quot;Bonjour, Mademoiselle Rarity. It is good to see you again,&quot; stated the large purple dragon. He bent down to take Rarity&#039;s hand in his claw and gave it a gentle kiss.</p><p class="double">&#039;Good, Spike is awake this loop.&#039; &quot;Enchente, Monsieur. As I explained to your wondrous servants here, I am looking to secure the release of my father.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike cocked an eyebrow, &quot;I&#039;m sure we can arrange something.&quot; Both of the loopers began to walk towards where Spike knew the dungeons would be, but were stopped by the loud rumbles of Spike&#039;s stomach and the matching sound from Rarity&#039;s. Both blushed before Spike spoke up. &quot;Um…I don&#039;t suppose you would grab us a quick meal, would you Lumiere?&quot;</p><p class="double">Looking back at the two, Spike and Rarity found Cogsworth desperately trying to clean his glass face and Lumiere with his mouth open. Lumiere quickly closed it as the question floated down to him and decided to go with the flow. Perhaps they would get this curse broken yet.</p><p class="double">&quot;But of course, Master. Follow me.&quot; Both loopers followed the bouncing candle into a grand hall before sitting down at an equally grand table. Coughing to clear his throat, Lumiere began to speak.</p><p class="double">&quot;Monsieur and Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight! Now, we invite you to relax, to pull up a chair, as the dining room proudly presents…your dinner.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Marvellous,” Rarity pronounced. “I must admit, I don’t tend to eat meat, but this meal was good enough that I might – almost, almost! – consider doing so more often.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded, seeing what she was actually saying. It was a reminder that she normally didn’t have the palate for meat – on account of not normally being human.</p><p class="double">“Anyway. My father?”</p><p class="double">“Of course.” Spike stood, hands on the table. “There is only one possible remuneration I can accept for releasing your father. Your service to me… for ever!”</p><p class="double">Rarity barely had time to react before Spike shrugged. “Worth a try. What about twenty years? Ten? Five? Okay, help me sort my wardrobe and a kiss for luck, and that’s my final offer.”</p><p class="double">Unable to help it, Rarity burst out laughing. “You are the most atrocious negotiator I have ever dealt with!”</p><p class="double">“Well, in my defence…” Spike paused, then shrugged. “Nope, got nothing. Anyway, my wardrobe?”</p><p class="double">“Most certainly. Though it won’t be any great hardship…”</p><p class="double">As they left the room, Rarity frowned. “Wonder who the Anchor is? Maybe Twilight’s around somewhere.”</p><p class="double">“Could be.” Spike waved a hand – maybe yes, maybe no. “But then, this world’s hardly small, and we could be on the other side of it from the anchor. Twilight was here once – she was a different kind of unicorn to normal, so maybe that’s who the Anchor normally is.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Belle Bell, owner of a small bookshop in Ponyville, paged through a book on her counter. She was told by one of the local loopers, one Fluttershy, that the main anchor of the loop would be coming to meet her once she arrived from Canterlot. Belle was excited to meet another looper that loved books as much as she did. The door jingled, signalling a new entrant into the shop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome to Belle&#039;s Books, where the whole world…is…*SNORT*&quot; Belle was holding her hoof to her snout in order to contain her laughter. Before her was quite certainly the local anchor Twilight Sparkle. On her back was a quite familiar individual to Belle. If that individual was suddenly two feet tall and adorably fluffy.</p><p class="double">The Beast snorted as Belle collapsed laughing. &quot;I wanna go home.&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>20.1</p><p class="double">“Mua ha ha!” Trixie laughed evilly, horn flaring as she reshaped the land around Ponyville to her whim.</p><p class="double">“But… that’s impossible!” Twilight cried, shielding her eyes.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Trixie asked, suddenly sounding uncertain. “You sure?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, yes,” Twilight said. She got out some paper and wrote equations on it. Trixie moved around to watch, occasionally nodding or pointing at some particularly important clause.</p><p class="double">“There,” Twilight finished. “See?”</p><p class="double">Trixie perused the paper, lips moving. “You are correct.” The spell abruptly dissipated. “Oh well, worth a try. Do you know a good restaurant around here?”</p><p class="double">“I’ve heard good things about the <i>Farrier’s Rest</i>.” Twilight nodded. “Mind if I join you?”</p><p class="double">“Not at all.”</p><p class="double">Dash blinked. “Wait, what just happened? Did you just disprove Trixie with science?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, it was logic,” Twilight replied over her shoulder. “Proof by contradiction.”</p><p class="double">“But we <i>saw</i> her! She was <i>doing </i>it!”</p><p class="double">“Anecdotal evidence counts for nothing.” Twilight walked off, discussing something or other with Trixie in a low voice.</p><p class="double">Dash shook her head again. “Ah, whatever.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Nice one,” Trixie said, nibbling on some celery. “The looks on their faces…”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Twilight frowned. “Hey, tell you what. Want to turn up next time as an alicorn?”</p><p class="double">“Trixie likes how you think.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.2</p><p class="double">“The Night Will Last Forever!” Nightmare Moon finished, and dramatic thunder crashed.</p><p class="double">Then it cut off as suddenly as a knife, and a sky-blue alicorn trotted onto the stage from the left. “Mother!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked, as things went abruptly off-script. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">“For goodness’ sake, mother,” the newcomer said, shaking her head wearily. “What <i>are </i>you doing?”</p><p class="double">Some of the spectating Ponyville ponies noticed that her cutie mark incorporated a moon motif, alongside a wand. Twilight Sparkle, meanwhile, tried to avoid giggling.</p><p class="double">“Who are you?” Nightmare Moon asked.</p><p class="double">“And you don’t recognize your own daughter!” Trixie said, shaking her head and continuing to trot up to her ‘mother’. “You are drunk, mother. Come on, let’s get you home.”</p><p class="double">“I am NOT drunk!” Nightmare Moon shouted. “I am the rightful ruler of Equestria, not some two-bit sot!”</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Berry Punch shouted from the crowd, putting down her third beer of the night. “Sots are ponies too!”</p><p class="double">“And now you’re going to make a scene.” Trixie’s voice had what Twilight judged as an artfully recreated hitch in it. “This happens every week. Is there somewhere I’m going wrong? Some filial duty that I’ve failed in?” A tear rolled down Trixie’s cheek.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was by this point completely confused. “Er… what… don’t cry?”</p><p class="double">Trixie smiled wanly. “Please, mother,” she said, in a soothing tone. “You’ll feel much better once you’ve slept it off. Come on, now, we can leave these poor ponies to… whatever they were doing, and go home.”</p><p class="double">There was a bright blue flash, and both alicorns vanished.</p><p class="double">“…okay, what just happened?” Dash asked. “I mean, what?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie showed up the next morning at Twilight’s door.</p><p class="double">“Cured her!” the stage pony said proudly. “Got her drunk for real and we had a heart-to-heart, she got it all out of her system, and then I explained what was actually going on.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight noted that down. “Guess sometimes all a pony really needs is a shoulder to cry on.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” Trixie then blushed, and ruffled her wings. “Might not be a good method to try out again, though. Nightmare Moon can be a bit of a fighty drunk. Anyway, if Celestia asks, that’s why Horseshoe Bay is now just … er, Horseshoe. Later!”</p><p class="double">She vanished again in a puff of smoke.</p><p class="double">Twilight cast a scrying spell. “Whoa. Yeah, that’s a lot of terrain damage. Good thing nopony lives on that bit…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.3</p><p class="double">“Ah, Cadence. Good to see you. If you’ll just come this way?” Celestia gestured. “There’s just a few matters of administration to work out before the wedding.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” Chrysalis said smoothly. “Not a problem.”</p><p class="double">There was a little flicker of anticipation coming from the ruler of Equestria, but none of the rage which would indicate her ruse was discovered… so it was likely to be just looking forward to the wedding itself.</p><p class="double">Then she froze, halfway through a pair of double doors.</p><p class="double">Sitting at the other side of an ornate table was the <i>real</i> Cadence.</p><p class="double">“Hello,” Cadence said frostily. “So, who are you getting married to, and why did you feel the need to hijack my wedding? It’s <i>my</i> wedding, thank you very much!”</p><p class="double">“But… how did you escape?”</p><p class="double">“Magic.” Cadence shrugged. “Anyway. I certainly don’t have a problem with you getting married – in fact, you can take my slot – but you don’t get my groom. Any preference?”</p><p class="double">“But… what?” Chrysalis dropped her shapeshift. “Shouldn’t you be angry?”</p><p class="double">“I’m not angry, so much as… disappointed.” Cadence waited a moment. “No suggestion? Right, we’ll just use the best stallion we had booked – a noble from my homeland, I’m sure you’ll like him. Rings… we had a couple of the hoof ring variant made, so you can take them with our blessings. Dresses… oh, no, that won’t do. Shining!”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor walked over from behind Chrysalis, shooting her a dirty look. “Yes, dear?”</p><p class="double">“Can you go fetch your sister’s friend? The one who’s good with dresses? We need a rush job.” Cadence nodded to herself. “I think I’ll pay for it, too.”</p><p class="double">Her boyfriend nodded, and vanished in a teleport.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis’s head was whirling, trying to keep track. “What is going on?”</p><p class="double">“Food is fine… though I’ll have to handle the catering for the changeling half…” Cadence mused, ignoring her. “Oh, last minute change to the statuettes on the cake. Aside from that, I think that’s everything… no, wait. What music do you like?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis startled. “Oh. Er, not sure.”</p><p class="double">“I’ll just guess, then. Right, that’s everything. Rarity of Ponyville should turn up to fit you momentarily.” Cadence disappeared in her own teleport.</p><p class="double">“…what the <i>buck?</i>” Chrysalis asked the air.</p><p class="double">A pink blur shot into the room, bounced off three walls, and coalesced into a pink earth pony with candy-floss for a mane. “Ooh, okay… definitely liquorice for you!” Five seconds with a sketchpad, and the pony shot off again in another blur.</p><p class="double">Then a white unicorn appeared with a tape measure and three metric tonnes of raw material. “Ah, a challenge! Goodness, though, the colour will be a sticking point… how do you feel about turquoise? It’s not done to have a wedding dress that isn’t white, but then that’s only a custom in any case.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis was now beyond words. Rarity took the silence to mean agreement, and began lifting up bolts of dyed silk to compare with Chrysalis’ mane.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I can’t help but think that we might be storing up trouble for later this Loop…” Celestia observed absently to Shining.</p><p class="double">“Maybe,” Shining allowed, watching as his sister, his basically-a-little-brother, and Princess Luna bamboozled King Sombra into a tuxedo. “But, well, they do tend to be actually rather good for each other. Besides, this way we don’t have to either change the arrangements for the wedding or have <i>another</i> one exactly the same as our normal one.” He shook his head. “Weddings are nice, but my lovely wife is a bit… obsessed with them. Just don’t tell her I said that.”</p><p class="double">“My lips are sealed,” Celestia assured him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.4</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Rainbow Dash said, frowning. “This is where we turn you into an awesome pegasus.”</p><p class="double">“…alright,” Fluttershy replied. “But, didn’t we already do this?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, kinda.” Dash shrugged. “Though I don’t intend to settle for good this time. I want to see awesome!”</p><p class="double">“What does that mean?”</p><p class="double">“Sonic. Rainboom.” Dash punctuated the words with hoof-beats… then stopped, looking into the distance. “But, wait, would yours even be a <i>rain</i>boom? I mean, it’s my weather magic signature that makes it be a rainbow. Ah, who cares.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blinked. “You think I can do that? But… you’re the only pony to ever do a sonic rainboom.”</p><p class="double">“Yet,” Dash replied. “Now, come on! Where’s that tow rope and those butterflies…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Come on!” Dash urged. “You can do better than this!”</p><p class="double">“I really can’t,” Fluttershy panted. To her credit, she’d just managed a three hundred mile an hour burst in a dive. Impressive enough that the Wonderbolts would probably have at least given her consideration, which was a huge improvement for the pegasus… but nowhere near Dash’s goal.</p><p class="double">“I’m just not strong enough to. I don’t know how you manage to push yourself so hard with just your wings.”</p><p class="double">“…wait,” Dash said, looking suddenly guilty. “What do you mean, <i>just</i> my wings? Most of my speed is weather <i>magic</i>. Didn’t I mention that?”</p><p class="double">“Er… no,” Fluttershy replied, then waved her hooves. “But I’m sure you meant to! It isn’t your fault…”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Dash shot off, and teleported in with Twilight a few seconds later.</p><p class="double">“Okay, Fluttershy,” Twilight said, smiling. “Now you get to have us teach you about weather magic!”</p><p class="double">“Yay,” Fluttershy said softly. It wasn’t quite clear if that was sarcasm or just… Fluttershy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Come on, come on…” Dash murmured, watching the speck of yellow plunge out of the sky. “Just a bit faster…”</p><p class="double">The cloud formed, narrowed… and broke.</p><p class="double">It wasn’t a Sonic Rainboom. It wasn’t a boom, there was no rainbow colouration, and it wasn’t even very loud. Fluttershy’s magical signature merged with the transient cloud from breaking the sound barrier, and rolled outwards like a comforting pillow.</p><p class="double">And a swarm of butterflies, bees and birds rose to meet it.</p><p class="double">Twilight noted that down. “So they <i>are</i> personalized. Interesting. Maybe the original sonic rainboom was done by another pony with a rainbow signature…”</p><p class="double">“Sounds about right,” Dash agreed. “Maybe I should look that up. Oh, can you let Pinkie know it’s time for a ‘Fluttershy is super awesome’ party? She deserves it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.5</p><p class="double">“Ah, it’s good to see you, little mother.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy eeped. “Can’t… breathe…”</p><p class="double">Leman Russ released her, ignoring the gobsmacked expressions of his honour guard. “And these must be Twilight, Rarity, Pinkie, Applejack and Rainbow Dash!”</p><p class="double">“Ah, you remember us!” Twilight said, smiling. “I hoped you would.”</p><p class="double">“I could never forget you.” The Primarch tapped a massive finger absently against his sword hilt. “Now, what’s first… of course! A feast!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “I like the sound of that!”</p><p class="double">The Space Wolves thought it over, and decided – en masse – that they did as well.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, what brings you to my humble corner of the universe?” Russ asked that evening. The two Fenrisian wolves he always raised lounged around him, all three dwarfing the six Equestrian visitors quite handily.</p><p class="double">“Well… we just, turned up here.” Twilight shrugged. “Loops are fairly random, after all. Though, actually, none of us have much idea what a normal Dark Millennium Loop is like. Anything you can tell us?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, don’t get me started!” Russ shook his head. “Bjorn can tell you all about it, he usually lasts quite a while even if I get thoroughly lost to the Warp.”</p><p class="double">Bjorn made what was almost certainly a rude gesture. “I always end up in a damned <i>dreadnought</i>, you mean. Boring as hel.”</p><p class="double">Russ grinned back. “Yeah, whatever. Anyway, what usually happens is that things get <i>really</i> nasty. I can never seem to stop all the Legions falling to Chaos – I saved the Thousand Sons, and the Raven Guard fell. Then I tried keeping the Death Guard pure, and that was it for the Ultramarines. Even tried killing off Horus, and that’s when I found out the whole thing got started by a <i>Word Bearer!</i> And as for trying to handle the Alpha Legion, I can never tell if I’m coming or going.”</p><p class="double">Twilight pondered that. “I guess Pinkie really did do a lot of good when she replaced Slaanesh.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, she did what?” Bjorn laughed out loud. “That must have been hilarious!”</p><p class="double">“It was super fun!” Pinkie’s eyes glowed. “I had <i>all the parties!</i>”</p><p class="double">“…actually, now I’m scared,” the Space Wolf looper muttered. “Wonder how Ciaphas would take that.”</p><p class="double">“Ciaphas?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I remember him!” Pinkie beamed. “He was awesome! Kinda nervous, though.”</p><p class="double">“I don’t blame him,” Leman said, sotto voce. “Little mother, your friends are sometimes a little unnerving.”</p><p class="double">“I know, Lemon – Leman, sorry.” Fluttershy exhaled sharply. “But they’re friends, and I wouldn’t give them up for anything.”</p><p class="double">“Aye, I know the feeling.” Russ scratched Geki behind the ear, looking into the distance.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright, girls,” Twilight said, beating her wings soundlessly to hold station in the immaterium. “Three, two, one..!”</p><p class="double">A bolt of rainbow light sizzled across the howling wastes of the warp, and impacted dead centre on the <i>Eisenstein.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight nodded briskly, as Nurglite daemons fled from the huge ship. “Five down, fourteen to go.”</p><p class="double">“This is getting tiring, though,” Rarity admitted. “You <i>know</i> the Elements never work so well outside Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I do.” Twilight let her magic build up for a gigantic teleport. “But we’re handling so much chaos I think we’re getting a fair performance out of them anyway. Right, next stop Ultramar.”</p><p class="double">Her power crested, and in an eyeblink they were a <i>long</i> way away.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And… done!” Twilight ticked off another item on her list. “Webway access acquired, Webway fixed, and Commorragh cut off from the network. What’s next?”</p><p class="double">Sifting through the paper, she answered her own question. “Here we are. Necrons. Any ideas?”</p><p class="double">Dash raised a hoof.</p><p class="double">“Apart from too many cyclonic torpedoes.”</p><p class="double">Dash lowered a hoof.</p><p class="double">“I know!” Pinkie said, suddenly. “I’ll go chat with Trazyn! He’s fun.”</p><p class="double">“Fun? Fun?” Russ goggled. “He once stole my thirteenth company!”</p><p class="double">“Eh,” Pinkie said, grinning. “Unlucky for some.”</p><p class="double">“Right, Pinkie’s handling that one.” Twilight pencilled that in. “Oh, how’s the Emperor doing? I haven’t seen him in a week.”</p><p class="double">Russ grinned uneasily. “I may have sucker punched him after he questioned Mother’s presence.”</p><p class="double">“May?” Fluttershy asked warningly.</p><p class="double">“Alright, I <i>did</i> sucker punch him.” The Primarch shrugged. “Turnabout is fair play – and at least I wasn’t wearing a power fist.”</p><p class="double">He sobered. “I don’t know how to thank you enough. I mean, there’s still problems turning up all over the place, but the Emperor and my brothers are all still alive and… mostly… sane.”</p><p class="double">“Alpharius is the most fun one, silly!” Pinkie grinned. “Well, apart from Omegon.”</p><p class="double">“How do you even tell them apart?” Rarity asked absently.</p><p class="double">“Guesswork!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…and so, in the name of the Emperor of Mankind, ruler of the million suns, and in the name of his Empire of Man, and his tributaries, we welcome you to the stars. May you live long and well amongst the heavens.”</p><p class="double">Guilliman stepped back from the com system. “How was that?”</p><p class="double">“Laying it on a bit thick, there, don’t you think?” Fulgrim asked. “I mean, come on. They’re explorers, not politicians.”</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>I</i> happen to think you made the right choice.” Dorn shrugged. “I mean, it’s not every decade that an out-system power turns out to have discovered antigravity and artificial intelligence before even launching a moon mission. And five thousand years ago they were nomadic hunters.”</p><p class="double">“Still are.” Magnus the Red nodded. “Not one of them has a flicker of magic. That’s superstitious and backwards to my reckoning.”</p><p class="double">“I agree with Roboute,” Twilight said before the brothers got into too major an argument. “And I’ll just remind you that it kind of <i>is</i> my ship.”</p><p class="double">She felt a bit of a guilty thrill of pleasure at the thought. Russ had insisted, the Emperor had been interested, and she hadn’t felt she could turn it down… and the huge battlecruiser had turned out to be very useful, especially packed to the gunwales with scientific equipment and experiments.</p><p class="double">Jetbikes were pretty flippin’ cool, for example.</p><p class="double">But this was only the third time she’d managed to have the embarrassingly-titled <i>Saviour of Prospero</i> in position to make an official First Contact.</p><p class="double">All in all, she reflected, a 40K Loop could be quite pleasant. Well, if you headed the whole ‘only war’ thing off as soon as possible, and took measures to keep it well contained.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Get OFF me!” Khorne growled, snatching at the bubbly pink blur.</p><p class="double">“Nope!” Pinkie said, jumping from him to Tzeentch. “Ooh, what’s today’s plan?”</p><p class="double">“Get rid of you!” the Chaos God replied, scowling.</p><p class="double">“Ooh, just like all the other times!” Pinkie paused, pondering. “Ooh, alliteration. Anyway, you’re really not very creative at this kind of thing.”</p><p class="double">“Just GO AND BOTHER SLAANESH OR SOMETHING!” Khorne bellowed.</p><p class="double">Pinkie considered it. “Nah. Ooh, is that a doggy?”</p><p class="double">“That is not a <i>doggy</i>. That is a <i>hound</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Po-tay-to, po-tah-toe.” Pinkie threw it a dog biscuit, and it panted happily. “Dog. See?”</p><p class="double">“Why can’t we kill her?” Khorne asked, sighing heavily.</p><p class="double">Tzeentch kicked something. It turned out to be a flatfish. “She’s more chaotic than <i>we</i> are right now. And that flippin’ Laughing God and the Deceiver are both helping her.”</p><p class="double">“Figures.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.6</p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” Magnum muttered, trotting around Spike in a circle. “So, you’re a dragon.”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Spike said, confirming the screamingly obvious.</p><p class="double">“Didn’t know she was the type,” Pearl added. “It’s certainly… exotic.”</p><p class="double">Spike bushed to the base of his scales, holding his tongue by dint of long experience.</p><p class="double">“Motehr!” Rarity said, shocked. “Stop terrorizing my boyfriend!”</p><p class="double">“That’s not decided yet, dear,” Magnum said absently. Finishing his inspection, he trotted around to in front of Spike. “So… tell me. You much of a stallion for sport?”</p><p class="double">“Stallion, no. Sport… yes,” Spike answered, thinking it over carefully.</p><p class="double">“Hm. What kind? Hoofball?”</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">“What about Trottingham hoofball? I mean, it’s the boring kind, but-”</p><p class="double">“No, not that either.” Spike shook his head, an displayed his claws. “I’d go through too many balls.”</p><p class="double">“What about a bat sport? Baseball? Rounders?” Magnum sighed. “Not poncy cricket, is it?”</p><p class="double">“None of the above.” Spike was starting to grin, now.</p><p class="double">“Volleyball? Basketball? Netball? Tennis? <i>Table</i>-tennis?”</p><p class="double">Rarity giggled as her father tried out every sport he could think of.</p><p class="double">“All right, I give up.” Magnum pointed a hoof. “Okay, wise-guy, what sports <i>do</i> you play?”</p><p class="double">“Play isn’t the right word.” Spike raised a hand and began ticking off. “Archery – though Rarity’s edging me there nowadays; three martial arts; Chess-”</p><p class="double">“Chess?” Magnum interrupted. “That’s not a sport!”</p><p class="double">“It is when Twilight animates twenty-foot chess pieces who don’t know the rules. Anyway, where was I…”</p><p class="double">“Martial arts and chess,” Rarity supplied promptly.</p><p class="double">“Thanks. Anyway, as well as those, fencing and swimming… oh, and extreme sports.”</p><p class="double">“Extreme?”</p><p class="double">“Come on, I’ll show you!”</p><p class="double">Rarity was torn between laughing and sighing. In the end, she just giggled into her sleeve. “Oh, <i>dear.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well, he seems nice enough,” Pearl observed, as Spike led an unwary Magnum off for an afternoon’s male bonding. Or possibly abject terror.</p><p class="double">“He is.”</p><p class="double">“You’re sure about this?” she pressed.</p><p class="double">Rarity gave a huge, happy sigh. “Very,” she answered, with a diamond certainty that matched her cutie mark.</p><p class="double">“Right, then,” Pearl said. “I approve of him, then.”</p><p class="double">“…just like that?” Rarity asked. “I mean… not that I-”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry!” Her mother laughed. “It’s all about <i>you</i>, dear – the whole point of meetings like this is to see if you’re really happy, and to give you an out if you’re not. But you haven’t had that silly grin on your face since you first got your cutie mark, so <i>I</i> certainly don’t mind.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks, mum.” Rarity hugged her.</p><p class="double">After a minute or so, Pearl pulled back. “So, details.”</p><p class="double">“He’s a great musician, as well – piano, mostly.” Rarity sorted through details in her head. “He actually listens when I explain how my dresses and artifacts work, which is nice. He cooks well – though admittedly, as a dragon, he’s had some <i>very</i> strange ideas…”</p><p class="double">“How bad?”</p><p class="double">“Melon and trifle curry.” Rarity stuck her tongue out. “<i>Bleah,</i> quite frankly.”</p><p class="double">“I can see why…” Pearl said, covering a grin.</p><p class="double">Magnum materialized with an expression frozen into shock.</p><p class="double">Pearl frowned. “Dear?”</p><p class="double">“…I have no problem with him can we go now please dear?” the stallion rattled off in one breath.</p><p class="double">“Well, I suppose so, but-”</p><p class="double">“Okay bye nice seeing you Rarity!”</p><p class="double">Magnum disappeared in another teleport, taking his wife with him.</p><p class="double">About a minute later, Spike came into view on a hang glider. Dropping to the floor and slowing himself with the Force, he looked around. “Did I miss them?”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Rarity said to herself, stifling a giggle, “looks like Dad hit his limit. I didn’t know he could teleport that far…” She looked up at Spike. “We might want to try a different angle next time, though, Spiky-wikey. Something that doesn’t traumatize my father.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Spike nodded readily. “And, er, sorry for overdoing it.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t be.” Rarity shrugged. “The ‘meet the parents’ thing is supposed to be scary… although that is meant to be for the <i>colt</i>.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.7</p><p class="double">“Ready?” Shining asked.</p><p class="double">Cadence nodded, and grinned. “One, two, three!”</p><p class="double">The music started, with heavy use of pan-pipes. The couple – both alicorns – pranced down the steps of a Mesoamerican-style pyramid.</p><p class="double">Pinkie might have been at least slightly bonkers to have come up with this as a wedding celebration opener, but… well, it was novel.</p><p class="double"><i>“I hardly think I’m qualified,” </i>Shining sang,<i> “to come across all sanctified.”</i> He shrugged as they reached the bottom steps.<i> “I just don’t cut it with the cherubim-”</i></p><p class="double"><i>“Shiny, what are you talking about?”</i> Cadence interjected.</p><p class="double"><i>“There again,”</i> he continued, in a less sceptical tone, <i>“They’re on their knees. Being worshipped is a breeze, and rather suits us in… the interim…”</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>“It’s tough to be a god!”</i></p><p class="double">“You know,” Twilight mused, as her brother and sister-in-law reached the chorus, “I can’t tell if they’re serious or not.”</p><p class="double">“It is tricky,” Luna agreed. “And they, like you, both ascended.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.”</p><p class="double">After a moment, Celestia joined them.</p><p class="double">“I hope that the ponies attending won’t take that song the wrong way…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Canterlot can take a joke. Besides,” she added, as the couple started literally walking on the air, “it’s not as if they’re <i>really</i> pretending.”</p><p class="double">Celestia crossed her eyes. “Now I’m confused. Can you really pretend to be pretending to be real?”</p><p class="double">That got a giggle from her sister and her erstwhile student.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, come on!” Twilight said, mouth hanging open.</p><p class="double">“And therefore,” Blueblood droned, “It falls upon the sole member of the royal family never to have had pretensions to divinity to take up the mantle of rulership until such time as the crisis of confidence has passed.”</p><p class="double">The Anchor contained her anger. It wasn’t easy, though, since she was well aware that the ‘crisis of confidence’ consisted entirely of Blueblood feeling a bit ambitious.</p><p class="double">“Alright,” Celestia said, surprising Twilight. “Go ahead.”</p><p class="double">“Princess!” Twilight hissed. “What the-”</p><p class="double">Celestia winked. “Come on, now, Twilight, you heard him. A crisis of confidence is something we must avoid provoking further.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“We are in awe,” Luna said, reading Blueblood’s latest letter. It was a mixture of abject begging for his aunt to please come back and save him from the paperwork monster, and angry orders that she not abandon her subjects now that the crisis of confidence was over. “How did you manage this?”</p><p class="double">“That’s ‘didst thou’, Luna,” Celestia corrected.</p><p class="double">“No it isn’t,” Twilight disagreed. “I am as well. That’s where the plural comes from. Now spill!”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked mischievous. “I <i>may</i> have told everypony in the castle and bureaucracy to make sure Blueblood was fully involved in the exciting work of running the nation.”</p><p class="double">“…so every pony who needed <i>anything</i> signed went to him,” Twilight finished. “Oh, that’s almost evil.”</p><p class="double">“Wait until you see my next trick.” Celestia replied, eyes sparkling.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You?” Blueblood said, looking at the sick phoenix. “<i>You</i> are Auntie’s personal representative?”</p><p class="double">Philomeena nodded, and gave a hacking cough that covered Blueblood in soot.</p><p class="double">“Faugh!”</p><p class="double">She giggled behind a wing, hiding it as soon as he’d managed to get his eyes clear.</p><p class="double">After a moment, a green flame appeared overhead and coalesced into a letter. Warily, Blueblood opened it.</p><p class="double">“You have won a free subscription to ‘Friendship’ magazine,” he read slowly. “We will send you a free binder and all the back episodes in just a moment.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You didn’t mean it, did you?” Luna asked. “Not <i>all</i> of them?”</p><p class="double">“No,” Twilight admitted. “That would be several tonnes. No, just the ones relating to how you can have too much of a good thing, and so on. The lessons he needs. Who knows? Maybe he’ll pick something up.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.8 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Macintosh, are you awake?”</p><p class="double">“Eeyup.”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s face fell as she realized that was technically true whether the stallion was looping or not.</p><p class="double">“Are you awake-awake?”</p><p class="double">Macintosh just tilted his head at her. This probably wasn&#039;t him, but there was one way to be sure.</p><p class="double">“ETERNAL TWILIGHT, BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed as Big Mac gave her a look like she&#039;d gone slightly insaner than normal.</p><p class="double">“Right. Not looping. Could we just pretend this never happened?”</p><p class="double">Mac nodded his head, not commenting on the muttered comment he overheard as the purple unicorn left.</p><p class="double">“I *<b>really</b>* need to work out a system with him next time he&#039;s awake...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.9</p><p class="double"><i>Once upon a time, many years ago, Nasrudin was condemned to death. It is said he had poached one of the Kings rabbits to feed his starving children.</i></p><p class="double"><i>His case was hopeless but he nonetheless took the only avenue open to him. He appealed to the King to have the death penalty lifted. This was so unusual that the King (perhaps out of boredom) granted the man a one minute audience.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Nasrudin appeared before the King and said, &quot;Your Majesty, I have been found guilty of a crime and the penalty is death. I have a unique gift and my death would be a great loss to the world, so I ask you to spare me.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;What is this gift?”asked the King.</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I am the only person in the Kingdom, perhaps the whole world, that can teach horses to sing.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>The King laughed. &quot;And, for this outrageous claim, I should let you go?&quot; he asked.</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;It is not outrageous,&quot; replied Nasrudin. &quot;It takes time, a lot of patience and the gift that only I possess, but I can teach your horse to sing.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Very well,&quot; said the King, &quot;you shall have a year. You will be taken each day from prison to the Royal Stables. If you can teach my horse to sing I will spare you. If I find that you have lied to me you will be tortured before you die. Now, take him away.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>As Nasrudin was being led away the jailer asked him, &quot;What was the point of that? In a year you will be dead and now you will have to suffer first. You will not escape.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You <u>may</u> be right&quot;, replied Nasrudin, &quot;but I have bought time.&quot; I now have a whole year and in that time a great deal may happen. The King may die, his horse may die or, who knows, the horse may learn to sing&quot;.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nasrudin blinked. “I honestly didn’t see that coming.”</p><p class="double">The mare winked at him, tossed her purple-curled mane, and launched into <i>Siegfried and Kriemhild</i> from the <i>Nibelunglied.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.10 (Elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">Macintosh went about his chores, savoring the simplicity of the tasks. Things like bucking trees, plowing fields, and preparing the farm for the reunion were all straightforward. He could look at the problems and see quite clearly what he needed to do to accomplish them.</p><p class="double">Making amends with the members of his family that were looping? Not so straightforward.</p><p class="double">Applejack had been outraged. The bond between Apples was not shallow, and the fact he hadn&#039;t trusted her had nearly cut that deep. Nevertheless, that was over with.</p><p class="double">Now, all that remained was to explain to the filly humming around his feet as they brought in the day&#039;s harvest.</p><p class="double">Applebloom had always been his “little” sister. He and Applejack were more or less equals nowadays. They split the adult tasks between them, with Granny Smith intervening when necessary. Applebloom, on the other hoof, was the one who needed a shoulder to cry on, lunches for school, and a bit of attention now and then to keep her from going completely bonkers.</p><p class="double">Even more than Applejack, little Bloom had been the sibling he&#039;d helped raise. He&#039;d watched her grow from a little sprout that did little more than eat, sleep and cry to the filly she was now. She&#039;d kept on growing, making friends, learning so much, slowly but surely moving toward adulthood. He had seen it happen to the filly umpteen times.</p><p class="double">But this was not that filly.</p><p class="double">The signs were more subtle than with Applejack, but they were there sure enough. She moved with a practiced ease. The adorable little mistakes she&#039;d make from time to time were not there, or looked scripted to his eyes. When he spoke to her, he could tell she was listening, but the gears behind her eyes were obviously turning with something more than the impish schemes of a schoolfilly.</p><p class="double">This was the looping Applebloom.</p><p class="double">Applejack, thank the Princess, was not awake, and neither was anypony else aside from Applebloom and Twilight, if his earlier visit to town was any indication.</p><p class="double">He stopped, the cart straining against the harness as its momentum tried to keep going despite him. Directly ahead and slightly down, there was a pair of huge sparkling eyes and and the wide smile she likley thought would get her what she wanted.</p><p class="double">He tilted his head. What was that?</p><p class="double">“Ah said, ahm&#039; super excited for the fam&#039;ly reunion! Ya think we&#039;ll get any of the Manehattan cousins down this year?”</p><p class="double">He shook his head, both answering the question and searching his memories for the reason. Might as well keep up appearences a little longer.</p><p class="double">“Eenope. They&#039;re on hard times out there, got ta run their bakery ta make up fer last year. Y&#039;ll meet yer cousin some other time.”</p><p class="double">“Awww...”</p><p class="double">He was reasonably sure the ensuing pout was genuine. Those two had really hit it off after their initial meeting. He wondered if Babs had started looping...</p><p class="double">And so, the two Apples went on, Applebloom chattering ceaselessly at her brother, Macintosh just enjoying the company of his sister, albeit an alternate version thereof.</p><p class="double">They were almost back to the farm before he finally decided to end it.</p><p class="double">At first, he was worried she&#039;d have the same reaction as Applejack. It turned out his fears were misplaced. Perhaps the implications hadn&#039;t sunk in yet, but Applebloom just seemed to be happy to see him.</p><p class="double">“An&#039; we can go on all sorts of adventures, an&#039; we can work on gettin&#039; you powers!”</p><p class="double">Mac winced as Applebloom continued.</p><p class="double">“ooh, ah wonder when you&#039;ll become an Alicorn, ah mean, me an&#039; mah friends haven&#039;t yet, but all the adult loopers have.”</p><p class="double">Another wince. That had been an awkward conversation. Applejack&#039;s sense of humor had apparently changed for the sarcastic.</p><p class="double">“Would ya need an element of harmony, or would ya be able to do it like Caden-”</p><p class="double">A large red hoof cut off the tirade. Gently, like a massive plush muffle. Two huge doe-like eyes looked up into Macintosh&#039;s, and he couldn&#039;t keep himself from smiling.</p><p class="double">“Ah appreciate th&#039; thought Bloomers, but ah don&#039;t need no fancy unicorn princess powers. Me an&#039; Ms. Twilight already had a talk &#039;bout that. Ah just want to keep on keepin&#039; on. If the situation comes up where ah need to be somethin&#039; like that, we&#039;ll deal with it then.”</p><p class="double">The doe eyes continued even as the hoof left her mouth.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ll still have adventures an&#039; hang out an&#039; all that, won&#039;t we?”</p><p class="double">Macintosh felt his smile widening as he replied.</p><p class="double">“course we will. Ms. Sparkle gathers trouble lahk a lantern gathers moths. Ah&#039;m sure we&#039;ll hit mor&#039;n enough interesting adventures.”</p><p class="double">The sparks were dancing behind her eyes again, and her smile reached from ear to ear.</p><p class="double">“An&#039; we&#039;ll face &#039;em together, right?”</p><p class="double">Macintosh winked. The answer went without saying, but a bit of reassurance wouldn&#039;t go amiss. This was his little sister, after all.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup!” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.11</p><p class="double">“We need to find a good Earthbender,” Katara said, looking around as though one would appear up out of the ground.</p><p class="double">Sokka nodded, half his mind on something else. Specifically, how Toph was doing.</p><p class="double">She’d had it hard for the first few loops after she awoke, he knew, but by now Sokka knew exactly how to manipulate events to make sure she got away from her parents every time – and without letting on that she had Metalbending, either.</p><p class="double"><i>Ah, the life of an anchor</i>, he thought. <i>And I don’t even have Bending. Whose idea was it to put me in charge of these guys?</i></p><p class="double">“’scuse me,” a voice whispered next to him. Absently, Sokka moved aside.</p><p class="double">“Thanks.”</p><p class="double">“You’re welcome,” the Anchor replied… then spun on one foot and stared, as a small orange horse surfed casually up the street on a wave of earth.</p><p class="double">And was it him, or did the horse have milky white eyes?</p><p class="double">“Wait a second,” he said. “<i>Toph?</i>”</p><p class="double">The horse shook its head, still moving.</p><p class="double">“Are you a Replacement?” Sokka asked, remembering what a crazy fellow Looper in an orange jumpsuit had told him, that time Aang… wasn’t Aang.</p><p class="double">The grinding sound of earthbending died away, and the horse turned to look <i>almost</i> towards him. “Well, shucks. Looks like ah found me a local Looper… at last…”</p><p class="double">“Nice to meet you,” Sokka said, ignoring the increasingly bewildered looks of his friend and sister. Oh, and the whole street. “I’m Sokka.”</p><p class="double">“Applejack,” the horse replied. “I ain’t usually blind, but ah got to admit that this whole earth movin’ trick is kinda neat.”</p><p class="double">“And are you usually… a horse?”</p><p class="double">“Nope. Pony.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Sokka thought wistfully of the alcohol he probably wasn’t allowed to buy in the Earth Kingdom, then shrugged and turned to the gathering crowd. “Thank you for watching our rehearsal! We’re part of the Ember Island Players, touring to raise awareness! Come see us some time!”</p><p class="double">Sokka had learned from long experience that there was literally <i>nothing</i> that he couldn’t pass off as Ember Island Players rehearsal. Their production from the first time around had actually been relatively <i>accurate</i>…</p><p class="double">“What is all this about, Sokka?” Katara hissed.</p><p class="double">Sokka shrugged. “I found our Earthbender.”</p><p class="double">“But… horse?”</p><p class="double">“Pony,” Applejack corrected firmly. “And ah know Earthbendin’!”</p><p class="double">“Can you teach someone?” Aang asked. “Like, me?”</p><p class="double">“What the hay, let’s give it a try,” Applejack said. “Ah got to admit it’d be neat t’ know more about how bendin’ works myself, but ah learn by doin’ anyway.”</p><p class="double">“I still don’t think this is a good idea,” Katara muttered.</p><p class="double">“Hey, the Firebenders learned from dragons.” Sokka tossed his boomerang in the air. “Nothing actually wrong with it.”</p><p class="double">He tossed the boomerang again, and a lasso snagged it from the air.</p><p class="double">Turning, he saw the newcomer had the lasso firmly in her… mouth?</p><p class="double">“How did you aim that?” Aang asked, staring.</p><p class="double">“Earthbending.” Applejack’s voice was just a tiny bit smug.</p><p class="double">Katara nodded. “Okay, that <i>is</i> pretty cool.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.12</p><p class="double">“Are you <i>certain</i> this is going to work?” Diamond Tiara asked, frowning at a rather unusual version of her customary headgear.</p><p class="double">“Well…” Sweetie grimaced. “Not <i>certain</i>, no. But pretty close. I mean, we’ve seen this loop type once before, and my sister went over these things with a fine-tooth comb.” So saying, she slipped on her necklace and its golden pendant.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Diamond gulped, then put on the tiara. When she unaccountably failed to explode, she tried to pretend she’d never been nervous at all while still keeping a close eye on it.</p><p class="double">“Where’s Silver Spoon?” Applebloom asked, her own copper-apple bracelet already firmly around one hoof.</p><p class="double">“Dunno.” Diamond touched the tiara gingerly. “How do these work?”</p><p class="double">“I think sis said she’d made it so they were voice activated?” Sweetie thought for a moment, then nodded. “Alright. ‘Harmony power, make up!’”</p><p class="double">There was a flash of bright gold light, and when it faded Sweetie was wearing what looked like a cross between royal regalia, a filly’s dress and battle armour.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that <i>is</i> kind of cool,” Diamond allowed. “The armour is enchanted and collapses into the necklace, or whatever. But… <i>what</i> was the command phrase?”</p><p class="double">“Rarity said the only way we’d say it by accident was if somepony came out with a makeup line called harmony power.” Sweetie giggled. “Actually…”</p><p class="double">“Next time,” Applebloom chided her. “We have enough to be going on with this time.” She looked at her bracelet. “I still wish I knew how this thing worked, but Rarity is still better than me at seal script. Anyway, Harmony power make up!”</p><p class="double">“What name did you choose?” Sweetie asked, as Applebloom’s own fuku-armour materialized.</p><p class="double">“We choose names?” Diamond said. “Why wasn’t I informed?”</p><p class="double">“Because you don’t need to choose a name,” the other two chorused.</p><p class="double">“Seriously, Diamond Tiara is good enough already. Same for Silver Spoon,” Applebloom added. “Though ah do need one, and I’m leaning towards Copper Apple.”</p><p class="double">“Golden Voice, for me,” Sweetie replied.</p><p class="double">There was a skidding sound, as Scootaloo arrived outside. “Hi, less-cool ponies – oh, wow, I take it back. Hi, Applebloom and Sweetie Belle.”</p><p class="double">Diamond waited. “What about me?” she asked, after several seconds of silence.</p><p class="double">“Nah, I already said hello to you.” Scootaloo winked</p><p class="double"> Diamond stuck her tongue out, before coughing and pulling it in again.</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” she said, trying not to blush at her sudden loss of dignity, “what’s Scootaloo’s new name?”</p><p class="double">“Bronze Wing.” Scootaloo showed her own power trinket, this one an amulet, then activated it.</p><p class="double">“Come on!” Applebloom said, nodding at her. “Your turn.”</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Diamond said. “If you say so. Er… Harmony power make up?”</p><p class="double">Another flash of light, this one a brilliant rainbow colour.</p><p class="double">“Right. Marvellous. Excellent.” Diamond looked herself over. “What now?”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Applebloom frowned. “Ah’m not actually sure. Ah seem t’ recall that when you had this last time, you kinda… threw the tiara?”</p><p class="double">“What about you, then?” Diamond pressed.</p><p class="double">“Sonic powers.” Sweetie posed. “I can sing loudly enough to send monsters flying!”</p><p class="double">“And I can-”</p><p class="double">“No, never mind that now!” Ignoring Scootaloo’s hurt look, Diamond pointed at Sweetie. “You didn’t mention the monsters!”</p><p class="double">“…oops?” Applebloom tried.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, basically, Nightmare Moon ain’t going to be cured like normal, or something,” Scootaloo explained, “and we have to kick monster butt until we can purify her or whatever. Anyway, as I was saying, I can-”</p><p class="double">“But I’ve never got in a proper fight in my life!” Diamond wailed.</p><p class="double">“Easy enough to fix.” Applebloom nodded firmly. “Ah’ll get Dash and we kin teach you martial arts.”</p><p class="double">“Martial arts?” Diamond shook her head. “How vulgar. Oh well, if there’s no choice.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, there’s a choice,” Sweetie said, grinning. “You <i>could</i> just throw the tiara at monsters.”</p><p class="double">“Sign me up,” Diamond directed Applebloom without a moment’s hesitation. “Actually, can we start right now?”</p><p class="double">“Doesn’t any pony want to know what my powers are?” Scootaloo asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">“I’m sure Silver Spoon will,” Sweetie comforted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">20.13 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Turning the Tables continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle woke up the day before the Summer Sun Celebration in what she considered her own bed. Golden Oaks library had been her home for accumulated centuries of loops, and it was one element of the familiar she wouldn&#039;t have wanted to change. She&#039;d manifested a spare bed for Applejack and Rarity during that sleepover, so creating a cot to keep up appearances wouldn&#039;t be any hardship.</p><p class="double">She decided to have apples for breakfast, and in the process reconnect with another of her friends. To be honest, she was leaving the two hardest till last, Rainbow Dash since she moved around so much, and Fluttershy… well <i>she</i>would be a challenge. Without a baby dragon to &#039;spike&#039; her interest, she would be very hard to approach.</p><p class="double">Using the washroom and casting a few spells to complete her morning ablutions and shore up her cover identity, she headed out for Sweet Apple Acres. She&#039;d covered finding out about it in-universe by asking the right questions of Rarity, so visiting to see the place for herself and buy some breakfast apples right from the source was completely ordinary.</p><p class="double">From the carts and carriages around, even a small air-boat, it appeared the impromptu Apple family reunion had already begun. Dozens of Apple relatives were visible, helping out and generally getting on with things. But she needed to find Applejack. Ah, there was Apple Bloom. She would have to see if she could help the poor filly figure out her cutie-mark this loop. Twilight was certain her talent was for building and repairing stuff, but for some reason it never seemed to result in a cutie-mark.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pardon me young lady, but I&#039;m looking for Applejack? I wanted to buy some apples for breakfast, and Rarity told me she was in charge here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, big sis is probably in the orchard bucking apples for the festival, but she&#039;s awful busy right now. Who&#039;re you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight had to smile at the filly&#039;s directness. &quot;The name&#039;s Codex, I&#039;m the new librarian. I just got into town yesterday, and I&#039;m still finding my bearings. So what about you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Apple Bloom. Pleased to meet you Miss Codex.&quot; The filly head out a hoof, and Twilight took it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why not drop in the library some time? We have plenty of books for fillies and colts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, don&#039;t really read that much.&quot; Apple Bloom admitted. &quot;I&#039;m more interested in trying to figure out my cutie-mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">So that particular trait had preceded Diamond Tiara&#039;s little party. Not that it was surprising, a lot of unmarked colts and fillies started to get worried when their friends started getting their marks and they didn&#039;t.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m not just going to hoof you the old saw about it coming in its own time. Though it will, I&#039;m sure.&quot; Twilight liked the little filly, and wanted to do something nice for her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe if you come to the library, I can find you things to read on cutie-marks. If you know more maybe you&#039;ll figure out what your special talent is. And remember, that isn&#039;t your only talent. You can be good at things without having a cutie-mark in it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly looked at her lopsided, with a querying expression.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, take myself. I&#039;m a librarian, but I&#039;m also good at astronomy, and I&#039;ve learned quite a bit of magic. I&#039;m willing to bet you know some-pony who&#039;s good at something that isn&#039;t part of her cutie-mark.&quot; Twilight was willing to break cover slightly to prompt her with one example, but Apple Bloom was quite smart enough to think of it on her own.</p><p class="double">&quot;My sister Applejack! Her cutie-mark is apples but she&#039;s really good at rodeo stuff, herding critters and using a lasso. She&#039;s won blue ribbons in every rodeo in Ponyville for years!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There you are then.&quot; Twilight nodded approvingly, getting some-pony to come up with an answer themselves usually made the lesson stick better. &quot;Your cutie-mark talent is important but it isn&#039;t the only thing that makes you special. Always remember, you are defined by what you believe and how you act, not the mark on your flank, and don&#039;t let any-pony tell you differently..&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight realised she was lecturing, but she really did feel for the filly&#039;s predicament after seeing her work so hard for no reward in so many loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh, I never thought about it like that…&quot; Apple Bloom said, and then she smiled up at the unicorn. &quot;Gee, you&#039;re smart! Maybe I will come and read some books.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m happy to help.&quot; Twilight said with a feeling of satisfaction. Hopefully, she could help the filly cope more effectively with Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon when they started acting out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Apple Bloom! You&#039;ve still got some chores that need doing!&quot; A familiar voice called out. Applejack was coming up to the gate.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay sis! I was just resting for a bit.&quot; Apple Bloom turned away, then said over her shoulder, &quot;Goodbye, and thanks!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was my fault, I got chatting to her.&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shucks, it ain&#039;t a problem. I overheard what you were saying, that was a right decent thing you did. Lil&#039; Apple Bloom has been getting kinda antsy since her class started coming into their cutie-marks.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought as much.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;I meant every word. I&#039;ve seen it before, fillies who obsess on finding their cutie-marks and forget that they&#039;re more than that. Not to mention bullies who think no cutie-mark means they&#039;re a loser.&quot;</p><p class="double">What she didn&#039;t say was that Apple Bloom was chief among the first class of aforementioned fillies.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hear ya! I was late coming into my own cutie-mark, so I got some of that myself. I even went sky-hooting off to Manehatten, but I finally figured out this was where I belonged. &quot; Applejack shook her head. &quot;Anyhow, I&#039;m Applejack, welcome to Sweet Apple Acres!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Codex, the new town librarian. I just arrived here from Canterlot. As for finding where I belong... Never mind.&quot; Twilight held out her hoof and prepared for a shaking.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well howdy do, Miss Codex, a pleasure makin&#039; your acquaintance!&quot; Applejack finally released her hoof and dropped hers down, crossing her other fore-leg. &quot;So, what can I do you for this fine day?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I fancied some apples to go with my breakfast, and Rarity said you had the finest apples in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh! Try finest in Equestria!&quot; Applejack looked back over her shoulder at the mass of ponies. &quot;Well some of my family from out of town might have their own opinion...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought there were rather a lot of ponies for just one farm.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack gave a whinny of amusement. &quot;Yup, these are my kinfolk from all over Equestria. I asked them to come help getting together the food for the Summer Sun Celebration, and they came. It ain&#039;t every-day you get to see the Princess raise the sun in person.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a slight flinch, just enough to be noticeable. She saw Applejack notice it, but the mare wasn&#039;t likely to pry, at least not until she knew Twilight better. She schooled her expression to pleasantness, and asked, &quot;So anyway, how much for a half dozen apples?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, I guess since you&#039;re new in town, you can have a free sample. Matter of fact, we&#039;re just starting to get some samples ready for when that Royal Overseer comes to check on things. I guess you could give us a second opinion.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I really shouldn&#039;t…&quot; Twilight said, though she wanted to, and not only to have more chance to restore her friendship. Some of the smells coming from the farm-house were making her stomach growl. &quot;… but yes, I&#039;d love to!&quot;</p><p class="double">There followed a series of introductions startlingly similar to the events of the prime time-line. But this time, Twilight took the trouble to memorise the ponies as she was introduced, though it had been made easier by repeated introductions in prior loops.</p><p class="double">She got Applejack talking about her rodeo successes, and Apple Bloom about her school work, and did her best to get to know something about every-pony there. As with the party in Canterlot, she knew exactly how to get the other ponies talking about themselves, and as she&#039;d learned from Pinkie Pie, remembering things about ponies wasn&#039;t hard when you thought of them as your friends.</p><p class="double">She ended up eating rather more of the samples than she&#039;d intended, and making entirely honest complements about their excellence, and decided she needed to balance things. &quot;I really should help out some, after all of your hospitality…&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack waved it off. &quot;Don&#039;t worry about it! I reckon you&#039;re practically a part of the family! It&#039;s a pleasure to meet a pony who appreciates…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I say! Where is the pony in charge of this… shambles?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight froze up. No, it couldn&#039;t be! Had her disappearance sent Princess Celestia completely insane? She should have realised that the Princess would have to pick a replacement Royal Overseer, but out of all the ponies in Canterlot, to select <i>Blueblood</i>as her representative?</p><p class="double">She trailed Applejack back to the gate, hoping she was wrong. No, there he was, dressed in a stylishly cut tweed jacket that he must fondly imagine made him look like a rugged pony of action. He was flanked by two Royal Guards, probably the ones who&#039;d flown him here, presumably to highlight how important he was. Though considering his penchant for annoying ponies, maybe he actually needed bodyguards. While she&#039;d had little to do with the Prince in her original time-line, she&#039;d run across him several times in the loops and he&#039;d never made a positive impression.</p><p class="double">The fact that he&#039;d clearly considered her achievements in both magic and academics as worthless compared to the all-important noble title and wealth he&#039;d gotten by being born, and had been heard to refer to her as that &#039;jumped up little academic who subsists on my great aunt&#039;s charity&#039; did nothing to endear him to her. She suspected he&#039;d had designs on Cadence in more than one time-line, and her brother&#039;s romance with Celestia&#039;s adoptive niece had hardened his attitude to her family in those cases, and made him even more unbearable, something that she&#039;d have originally believed impossible.</p><p class="double">She pushed down her personal dislike of the stuck-up narcissistic prat, and tried to remind herself of his few positive points. He was also loyal to his great aunt, and a competent organiser. Also, while much of the Canterlot social elite were just as pleasant as any-pony else, there was a proportion of toffee nosed egotists, and Blueblood was the perfect foil to keep them in check by being even more top-lofty and superior than they were. If Celestia had been forced to deal with some of the more interesting examples of the dangers of inbreeding that Canterlot produced, she&#039;d probably have gone Infernal Blaze long since.</p><p class="double">However, Celestia normally kept her nephew in a close check rein, and sending him to somewhere like Ponyville to interact with normal ponies demonstrated a level of ineptitude that bordered on the imbecilic. However, that probably meant Celestia had nothing to do with it, she had probably handed off the task to some subordinate who lacked her keen appreciation of the level of disaster the arrogant clothes horse could engender simply by being his usual unbearable self. Not to mention his first port of call was the Apple homestead, which just about put the dollop of cream on this choice slice of disaster apple pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Applejack, and this is Sweet Apple Acres, not a &#039;shambles&#039;. Are you the fella who&#039;s supposed to be checking on the vittles for the Summer Sun Celebration?&quot;</p><p class="double">Blueblood gave a sniff of distain. &quot;<i>I</i>am Prince Blueblood, Royal Overseer for the Summer Sun Celebrations, and you will address me with the courtesy due to my rank!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. Yup, Blueblood still had it, not that any-pony else would <i>want</i>it.</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s voice took on an edge. &quot;You can be sure I&#039;ll treat you will all the respect you deserve.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well. Bad enough that Celestia&#039;s precious little charity project has run off to hide somewhere, leaving <i>me</i>to clean up the mess, but you could have at least made sure there was a carpet or something to keep my hooves clean while I crossed that yard full of dirt. It was bad enough having to walk up a dusty road, do you know what this will do to my hooficure?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why I&#039;m right sorry yer royal annoy… highness, I&#039;ll just get my kin-folk to lay down in a line so you can step from pony to pony without getting your hooves dirty.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t be silly!&quot; Blueblood exclaimed. &quot;Look at them. They&#039;re so scruffy there wouldn&#039;t be any advantage to it. No, I suppose I will have to walk across the yard myself. The things I&#039;m forced to do in the name of my Great Aunt…&quot;</p><p class="double">He walked in, trailed by the two guards who had the good grace to look at least slightly embarrassed, and the death glares of the entire Apple family. Twilight could have put a stop to it, popping wings as well as a horn in front of the idiot usually shut him up, but base-line Twilight wouldn&#039;t head for an immediate confrontation, and neither would Codex. Going alicorn would break her cover about as badly as possible and leave her with a lot of explaining to do.</p><p class="double">On it&#039;s own, that wouldn&#039;t have stopped her, her friends were more important to her than that, but even without massive alicorn powers and the advantages of a hundred loops of study, neither base-line Twilight Sparkle or her alter ego was a push over. She could salvage this the smart way, without simply throwing power at it. It was a close thing though, she&#039;d had no intention of making things harder for her friends, and she felt responsible.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>21.1 (more Turning the Tables, by Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“Is this some sort of joke?” Blueblood&#039;s perfectly polished tones came from the gazebo where Applejack had held the tasting. “You intend to offer Princess Celestia this... this carnival stall junk food?”</p><p class="double">“Now don&#039;t you take that tone with me, mister hoity toity hooves! This is made from Sweet Apple Acres finest apples, and every-pony in the Apple family contributed their best recipes to this spread.”</p><p class="double">“You intend to offer Her Royal Highness Princess Celestia common apples?” Blueblood looked down his muzzle at her. “The Princess only partakes of the finest cuisine, oranges from Manedarin, sweet cactus from Saddle Arabia, crisped Neighponese seaweed with the finest rose honey crystals from the Neighderlands. All of it is prepared by the finest chefs. As the ruler of Equestria she deserves no less.”</p><p class="double">Applejack scratched the back of her head with a hoof. “That&#039;s as may be, but I figure after all that fancy food, she might like to try some plain old apples, just for a change. And when it comes to making &#039;em into cakes and pies, I back our family against any-pony in Equestria... or all those other places, matter of fact. We even got some-pony from Canterlot to taste &#039;em already, and she reckoned they were just fine! Ain&#039;t that right, Codex?”</p><p class="double">Blueblood followed Applejack&#039;s gaze, and caught sight of Twilight&#039;s disguised form. “And <i>what</i> are you?”</p><p class="double">Twilight pushed down her first reaction, which would have seen him turned into the first ever royal artichoke, and tried to mediate. “I&#039;m Codex, the new town librarian, and I did live in Canterlot before I moved here. I think you&#039;re being far too hard on Applejack and her family, I loved everything I tried.”</p><p class="double">She noted the lack of crumbs or anything else around him. “It may not be as fancily presented as you&#039;re used to, but it&#039;s really good, and it&#039;s for the whole of Ponyville. You should try it at least.”</p><p class="double">“And hiding in a library for your entire life has made you an expert on organising a Royal visit how?” Blueblood sneered. “I don&#039;t need to try these pitiful pastries! Just as I don&#039;t need your advice to decide that the catering for the Summer Sun Celebration is not done!”</p><p class="double">He levitated his checklist and made a big cross against the first bullet point, and with that he turned on his hooves and trotted towards the gate. “I will have to get the Mayor to order proper food from a Canterlot bakery, one that serves the Palace, not some amateur farm-pony...”</p><p class="double">Applejack was fuming, and a couple of other members of her family seemed about ready to chase him down, guards or no guards, and were being held back by Big Macintosh. “Why that stuck-up no-account...!”</p><p class="double">“I can fix it.” Twilight said, interrupting her before she could “A simple copy correction spell and it&#039;ll be a tick. I can even delay it a couple of hours so he won&#039;t notice.”</p><p class="double">“You can do that?” Apple Bloom asked.</p><p class="double">“Sure, it&#039;s not enchanted legal parchment, just plain old paper. It&#039;s a standard spell for any-pony who has to manage paper-work.” As a librarian would, or a student of magic. After all, quills blotted occasionally.</p><p class="double">Applejack thought about it, then sighed, hanging her head. “Nope! It&#039;s tempting, but I ain&#039;t going to cheat like that. Besides, what if he&#039;s right?”</p><p class="double">Twilight snorted. “Princess Celestia wouldn&#039;t think that way for a second. Even if it wasn&#039;t up to her usual standards, she&#039;d still accept and appreciate that it was an honest effort, and trust me, those things are as good as anything you&#039;d get in a fancy Canterlot bakery!”</p><p class="double">She noticed Applejack looking at her curiously and reviewed her last few sentences. Oh, horse-apples!</p><p class="double">“How&#039;d you know all that about the Princess?”</p><p class="double">The only thing to do was roll with it. “Uh... well every-pony in Canterlot knows how the Princess acts. She is kind of a big deal, after all. Palace gossip even reaches us librarians. I also know all about &#039;Prince&#039; Blueblood, and trust me, that was exactly how <i>he</i> normally acts.”</p><p class="double">Applejack seemed to accept that. “Is there anything else we can do, any way we can appeal?”</p><p class="double">Twilight knew exactly what the responsibilities of a Royal overseer were, and that Blueblood had overstepped his authority, but base-line Twilight wouldn&#039;t. However, she&#039;d spotted a book that could help when she&#039;d been organising the library. She&#039;d read cover to cover several times in previous loops . “I don&#039;t know, but I think I saw a book in the library that could be useful. Can you keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn&#039;t do any more damage while I get it?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll do my best!” Applejack headed off.</p><p class="double">Twilight made her own way back to the library and just outside it almost ran into Rarity again. Twilight had been looking where she was going, but the white unicorn wasn&#039;t seeing anything, mostly due to the tears streaming down her face. “Whoa there! What&#039;s wrong?”</p><p class="double">Twilight could guess, and Rarity quickly confirmed it, between sobs. “Oh Codex, it was... terrible! Prince Blueblood.... himself was sent here to oversee the preparations... for the Summer Sun Celebrations. I was in charge of the... decorations, and when he appeared it was like... a dream come true. Then it turned into a nightmare!”</p><p class="double">“He immediately started going on about how insulting it was to offer to host the Princess in a &#039;mean little packing crate of a hall like this!&#039;. I did my best to impress him, explain my vision, and how much effort every-pony had put into getting them ready, but he called my materials, my designs... tacky and cheap! He said I was a know-nothing draper with delusions of adequacy!”</p><p class="double">This brought on a fresh wave of crying. “I thought he was my handsome prince, come to take me away, but instead he was...”</p><p class="double">“A royal pain?” Twilight asked, hugging her and manifesting a tissue to dry her tears and let her blow her nose.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” The hug or the sympathy had let her calm down a bit.</p><p class="double">Inwardly Twilight was a little surprised, Blueblood must be really annoyed, and taking it out on every-pony, as this went beyond even his native talent for jerk-hood. Artichoke-hood was looking better and better for him. Of course, he probably believed the stuff about Celestia, she was one of the few beings he looked up to, and put on a pedestal, and he projected his own attitudes onto her, but magnified...</p><p class="double">She suddenly had a horrid moment when she realised that that description could have applied to some-pony else. Her base-line self had been exactly that way about studying, for Celestia&#039;s sake she&#039;d just used the fact as part of her plan! The concept that she could ever have anything in common with Blueblood was immediately captured, imprisoned, banished to the moon and then imprisoned again for good measure. Fortunately Rarity had been to busy leaning on her shoulder to notice her moment of introspection.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry, I could have told you if I&#039;d known.” Twilight sighed. “Even I know that Prince Blueblood is a jerk, a stuck up prig with all the charm and social grace of the back end of a buffalo. I came back to the library to find a book on the job he&#039;s supposed to be doing, hopefully to spike his little white flying chariot.”</p><p class="double">Rarity drew herself up and set her most determined expression. “Then let us both look. Together maybe we can deal with this poisonous princeling!”</p><p class="double">The search didn&#039;t take long, and in moments they were trotting back out, Twilight holding the book up in front of her and reading while she trotted. She already knew what needed doing and who was doing it, but her in-loop self wouldn&#039;t. “Okay, catering, decorations... clear sky? Who would be doing that?”</p><p class="double">Rarity smirked. “There&#039;s only one pony that springs to mind, no make that does a loop de loop. Rainbow Dash, she&#039;s the senior weather pony for Ponyville.”</p><p class="double">“Well he doesn&#039;t seem to be doing much so far...” Twilight looked up at the cloud filled sky.</p><p class="double">“She.” Rarity corrected with a giggle, some of her good humour restored. “She&#039;s probably practicing her stunt routines or something, I hear the Wonderbolts are making a special visit from Canterlot for the Celebration, and every-pony knows she wants to be one.”</p><p class="double">They passed a Wonderbolts poster, and Twilight replied, “Well, she&#039;s got to be warned about Blueblood, he&#039;ll probably take one look at the sky and cross it off as undone. Hmm...”</p><p class="double">Seeing a blue and rainbow blur out of the corner of her eye, she called out in a loud voice. “Why Spitfire! You&#039;re here a day early? Maybe I could get an autograph...”</p><p class="double">She took a step to one side and materialised a purple net of energy standing on end to intercept the blue streak that arrived before she finished her sentence. It shifted underneath her and lowered her to the ground.</p><p class="double">“Hey, thanks for the save! I heard Spitfire was here and I might have got a little overenthusiastic getting here... So where is she?” Rainbow Dash was eagerly looking around for her idol.</p><p class="double">Twilight gave an embarrassed smile. “I&#039;m afraid I was making that up. I&#039;m Codex, the new librarian. And you would be Rainbow Dash?”</p><p class="double">“The one and only!” The blue pegasus preened, then gave a sigh, “So you were just pranking me? Aw, nuts! Heh, well, you got me good. I didn&#039;t figure librarians went in for pranks.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;d be surprised, but that wasn&#039;t why I was doing it.” After all this whole thing was a prank, though it was starting to turn distinctly sour. Twilight held up the book. “The Royal Overseer for the Summer Sun Celebration is here already, a Prince Blueblood, and if he sees you haven&#039;t cleared the clouds... you are the one supposed to be doing that, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yep, but that ain&#039;t a problem. I can get a sky clear in ten seconds flat!” Rainbow Dash looked thoughtful for a moment. “Though come to think of it, I may have met the guy. White unicorn, fancy jacket, expression like some-pony smacked the back side of a buffalo?”</p><p class="double">That got both of the other ponies chuckling. Rarity exclaimed. “Oh my, yes, that describes him perfectly!”</p><p class="double">“I may have kinda run into him, and knocked him into a mud puddle.” Dash admitted. “I said I was sorry, even cleaned him off with a rain-cloud and a personal hurricane, but he just got those two guards of his to run me off. Not that I couldn&#039;t have taken &#039;em, but it wasn&#039;t worth the effort.”</p><p class="double">Twilight face-hooved, though the mental image of Blueblood with a hurricane hair-do was pretty satisfying. “I think we can safely say he&#039;s going to mark that task down as incomplete, that leaves only the music.”</p><p class="double">“Heh, Fluttershy is all over that, she&#039;s training up a choir of birds. She&#039;s really good with animals, but really shy around other ponies...” Rainbow&#039;s face suddenly fell. “Oh no, bozo Bluenose and his goon squad are heading right for her! We gotta stop him!”</p><p class="double">“Lead the way, Applejack is trying to slow him down...” Twilight was still managing to leaf through the book, even at a trot.</p><p class="double">“The pony from Sweet Apple Acres? Sure I saw her, but Blueblood&#039;s just ignoring her.”</p><p class="double">As Rainbow led them out towards the outskirts of Ponyville and Futtershy&#039;s cottage, they could hear Blueblood. “... this is a joke! How dare you attempt to pretend that a lot of twittering birds is a fanfare worthy of a princess! In Canterlot, only the finest musicians are even allowed to try for the privilege of playing for her!”</p><p class="double">“Hey! You just simmer on down before I make you! You ain&#039;t got no cause to be hollerin&#039; at Fluttershy like that! I told you, this ain&#039;t Canterlot, and you ain&#039;t got no right to treat any-pony like dirt either way!”</p><p class="double">“I am Prince Blueblood, and I can... Aghh! Get them off! Get them off!”</p><p class="double">They ran onto the scene to see Fluttershy&#039;s choir of birds dive bombing Blueblood, while Applejack stood between him and the cowering yellow pegasus. His guards were looking on, not jumping in to help on either side. Blueblood&#039;s hair was still in the poofy shape of Rainbow&#039;s patented Rain Blow-dry technique.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t let them get their droppings on me! My immaculate mane, my coat!”</p><p class="double">He staggered several steps back, and the birds flew away to circle Fluttershy protectively. His telekinesis scooped up several rocks and flung them at the birds. “Shoo! Shoo! Go away you horrid things!”</p><p class="double">The birds scattered, the poorly aimed rocks missing them, but the action finally seemed to spark Fluttershy into action. She flew up into the air and shielded the scattering birds with her wings and body. “How dare you! How <i>dare</i> you!”</p><p class="double">She swept down like an avenging angel (bunny) and ended up hovering with her face a few inches from his. “Throwing stones at poor innocent birds! You should be ashamed of yourself!”</p><p class="double">“Aaaahh!” Blueblood scrambled back further to avoid the fearsome gaze of the greater enraged Fluttershy. “Guards! Help! Get me away from this mad mare!”</p><p class="double">The two guards swooped in and scooped him up with a fore-leg under each shoulder, carrying him away towards Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“Whooeee! That was pretty impressive!” Applejack exclaimed, coming up alongside Fluttershy who was still breathing heavily.</p><p class="double">“Yeah! Way to go Fluttershy! You had that puffed-up prince by the eyebrows!” Rainbow Dash cheered.</p><p class="double">Rarity beamed. “The way you routed that ridiculous ruffian was a joy to watch! ”</p><p class="double">The yellow mare seemed to finally realise where she was and that she was surrounded by ponies and shrunk in on herself a little bit.</p><p class="double">“Every-pony, I think we should give her some space.” Twilight said quietly but firmly. “I know you&#039;re probably her friends, but I don&#039;t think she wants to be crowded right now.”</p><p class="double">“Heh, you might be right, Fluttershy ain&#039;t the best of ponies for being the cettre of attention.” Rainbow Dash admitted. “C&#039;mon Applejack, Rarity was it, we can let her catch her breath for a bit.”</p><p class="double">“Um... Fluttershy? Maybe you should go and check your birds are okay?” Twilight suggested.</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus nodded, with a faint echo of what might have been a grateful smile and flew off to collect her scattered birds.</p><p class="double">Applejack turned to Twilight. “I&#039;m sorry Codex, I did my best to stall him, but he&#039;s as stubborn as a stump.”</p><p class="double">“We all saw you did all you could.” Twilight smiled, adjusting her pince-nez glasses with a flick of telekinesis. “Fortunately, I managed to find this.”</p><p class="double">She held up the book on high so every-pony could see it. “Prince Blueblood has been exceeding his authority in half a dozen ways, as well as making a complete ass of himself. With this I can call him on it. He&#039;s probably at the Mayor&#039;s office right now, ranting and raving, doing his best to make sure Ponyville doesn&#039;t get to host the Summer Sun Celebration. What say we trot on over there and spike his little white flying chariot?”</p><p class="double">“Sure as sugar!” “Yeah!” “Let us be off!” “um...”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to see Fluttershy hovering some way back, looking at her. “I&#039;d like to come too, if you don&#039;t mind...”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled her most genuine smile. “We&#039;re glad to have you along. I&#039;m Codex, the new librarian... Don&#039;t worry, I know, you&#039;re Fluttershy. Dash told me you were more comfortable around animals than ponies?”</p><p class="double">She started leading the group back towards Ponyville as Fluttershy gave a nervous nod. “I sort of know where you&#039;re coming from, it wasn&#039;t so long ago I felt more comfortable around books than ponies. I guess I just needed to meet the right ones...”</p><p class="double">She looked around at the others, and they gave encouraging grins or smiles back. “I know I&#039;m among friends here, and I think you can be too. You don&#039;t have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable, but I&#039;m sure every-pony is glad to have you with us.”</p><p class="double">“Ohh! Can I come too? What is this, a parade? A party? A party-rade... that sounds like a cool drink to serve at at party parade!” Pinkie had arrived from... somewhere.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re going to see the mayor and deal with Prince Blueblood and his guards.”</p><p class="double">“So that&#039;s the new pony I saw in the town square today! I knew he was new because I didn&#039;t recognise him and I know every-pony in Ponyville, so I went &#039;GASP&#039; and thought since he was new he wouldn&#039;t have any friends, except those two guards and they looked kinda grumpy, and that made me sad so I was going to throw a &#039;Welcome to Ponyville&#039; party for him and you and him so that you&#039;d both make lots of new friends!”</p><p class="double">She stopped for breath. “Great, so what are we going to play when we deal, Canasta, Go Fish, Strip Poker?... I really should put on some clothes if we&#039;re going to play Strip Poker...”</p><p class="double">“Uh, sugar-cube, that ain&#039;t what Codex there meant. Blueblood is trying to stop Ponyville hosting the Summer Sun Celebration, and we&#039;re going to stop him stopping it.”</p><p class="double">“No Summer Sun Celebration? But it&#039;s going to be the biggest, bestest party in Ponyville ever!” There was suddenly a fire in Pinkie&#039;s eyes. “No-pony stops the Summer Sun Celebration!”</p><p class="double">Twilight held up the book. “He won&#039;t, and we&#039;re going to stop him with this!”</p><p class="double">They reached the town hall to find the entrance guarded by the two Royal Guard pegasi. As the group approached, their wings swept out to cross the entrance with a metallic shing.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry, but no-pony is allowed in there. Prince Blueblood is meeting privately with the mayor.” the left hand one stated.</p><p class="double">“I bet he is!” Rainbow Dash growled, revving up to charge at them.</p><p class="double">“Dash, I&#039;ve got this!” Twilight called out as Applejack caught the pegasus&#039;s multi-coloured tail. She faced the two guards and glowered at them over the rims of her glasses, brows furrowed. “You will put those wings down or I will pluck them bare!”</p><p class="double">“Are you... threatening us ma&#039;am?” The guard who&#039;d previously spoken asked, slightly incredulous.</p><p class="double">He was clearly the senior of the two, so Twilight focussed on him. “No, I&#039;m ordering you to cease your illegal actions, and using hyperbole to make sure you&#039;re actually listening to me.”</p><p class="double">“Illegal?”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a theatrical sigh. “Are the two of you real Royal Guards, or just a pair of thugs Blueblood stuffed in armour to make himself look important? Well, sergeant?”</p><p class="double">She&#039;d watched Shining Armour do his command voice often enough, and she was a very good student. For that matter, she&#039;d helped him study for his officer&#039;s exam more than once, and knew the material at least as well as he did.</p><p class="double">The pair stiffened up at the question, and came to attention. “Royal Guards, Royal Protection Detail!”</p><p class="double">“Very well. Has Princess Celestia issued an order suspending civil writ in Ponyville?”</p><p class="double">“No ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">“Did she give Prince Blueblood plenipotentiary or ambassadorial powers, anything beyond the task of Royal Overseer for the Summer Sun Celebration?”</p><p class="double">“No ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">“Has the mayor granted you civil police powers within Ponyville?”</p><p class="double">“No, ma&#039;am?” The more talkative guard was now looking puzzled, while the younger&#039;s eyes suddenly widened in realisation, though he stayed still otherwise.</p><p class="double">Twilight noted it though. “I&#039;m glad to see at least one of you didn&#039;t sleep through basic training. Without explicit extension of your authority, your job is just to protect the Prince from physical harm or verbal abuse. You have no right to block off any-pony from access to a public building, let alone a civil servant going about her duties.</p><p class="double">“At most you could stand outside the Mayor&#039;s office and request that we not enter until the meeting is finished, and courtesy would require us to comply but that does not have the force of law, or allow you to use coercion. And as we have information bearing directly on Prince Blueblood&#039;s conduct of his position, it is our civil duty to lay it before the mayor before her meeting with Blueblood concludes.”</p><p class="double">She used the stare over the glasses move again. “Now. Drop! Those! Wings!”</p><p class="double">The pegasi&#039;s wings snapped back to their sides.</p><p class="double">The other ponies were staring at her in amazement.</p><p class="double">“Wow! You really are Codex the Librarian!” Pinkie exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Goodness darling, I hadn&#039;t realised you had such a commanding presence.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed. “I read the Royal Guard Field Officers manual? Also the Combined Forces guide, the Compendium of Military Law, a lot of legal and history books...”</p><p class="double">Plus several hundred loops of real life experience where she&#039;d been in life or death command positions more times than she could count.</p><p class="double">Twilight gave the two guards a pleasant smile. “Thank you gentlemen. I can see why you might think some of the ponies here might want to slap him silly. You are of course welcome to accompany us to see that we do not offer Blueblood any harm, which is within your remit. To be honest, In fact, in as much as it does not interfere with your primary duty, I request and require your assistance in delivering this information and material witnesses to the mayor.”</p><p class="double">“This is my right as an employee and therefore civil servant of the Township of Ponyville, as covered under section 34a, paragraphs 12 and 13 of the fifth revision of the Compendium of Military Law relating to civilian authority over the military. While Blueblood as Royal Overseer has that authority too, his is administrative, deriving from his specific duties, whereas mine is jurisdictional, deriving from my position here in Ponyville, and has primacy. In short, in this context, even I outrank him, and it covers you if he gives you any hassle over it.”</p><p class="double">“Ma&#039;am?” The sergeant spoke up.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked back at him. Having established her authority, she had no need or intention of beating them over the head with it. “By all means call me Codex, and you both are?”</p><p class="double">“Sergeant Silverwing, ma&#039;... Codex.” “Corporal Airheart.”</p><p class="double">Celeestia&#039;s blessing might make them look alike, but the higher, alto voice of the corporal suggested there was a girl under the helmet. “Very good, you wanted to say something, sergeant?”</p><p class="double">“An apology, and a warning. I think we both assumed Prince Blueblood had the authority of the Crown behind him. He&#039;s a powerful noble, and a bad enemy to make.”</p><p class="double">Twilight was genuinely touched, but then, despite what she&#039;d said earlier, a ponies for a Royal Protection Detail wasn&#039;t exactly picked out of a hat. “Thank you, Sergeant Silverwing. I&#039;m from Canterlot myself, and I&#039;m aware that his position gives him considerable extra-legal power. However, we&#039;re doing this strictly within the law and by the book... and I&#039;ve read lots of books. The second Diet of Canterlot requires nobles, and even the Royal family to act within the bounds of the common law.”</p><p class="double">“Uh... How&#039;d a weight loss plan do that?” Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">“This Diet was a constitutional meeting, headed by the Princess, several centuries ago. Equestria was in transit from a feudal model to a more imperial one, with a bureaucracy taking over administrative and executive duties from the old noble families. Some of them saw it coming and managed to gain control of the ministries, and expanding them to provide jobs for their families and hangers-on.</p><p class="double">“The bureaucracy was adding a lot of dead weight, you had departments which existed only on paper and in the accounts of the Exchequer, and Department heads who never actually set hoof inside their offices. Celestia used the Diet to push through reforms to make it more merit based, and root out the special privileges of the nobility that had allowed it to happen. To make it solid, she bound the Royal family to abide by the accords, and forced the lesser nobles to follow suit or be shamed.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie summed up. “So the government was overweight, and the Princess put it on a Diet?”</p><p class="double">“More or less...” Twilight giggled. “You were right Applejack, it was a weight loss plan.”</p><p class="double">She turned more serious. “As for making him a personal enemy... I&#039;ll deal with it as it comes.”</p><p class="double">She turned to the other ponies. “You&#039;ve all done your bit to make sure that there&#039;s a Summer Sun Celebration tomorrow, now it&#039;s my turn.”</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Blueblood was in full flow. He&#039;d had more than enough of this town, and every-pony in it. He&#039;d been dragged away from his preparations for a private and exclusive party he&#039;d been planning in Canterlot to deal with the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. He&#039;d done it last year in Canterlot, and the exquisite, and fabulously expensive soiree he&#039;d put together had netted him a huge amount of social capital. The fact that it had come out of the city budget rather than his personal accounts had been an added bonus.</p><p class="double">However, just because he&#039;d done it once, he didn&#039;t think he&#039;d be asked to do it again, and certainly not in a trivial little hamlet like Ponyville. After all, who of any status or worth in society was there here to impress? Meanwhile, every moment he was away from Canterlot, some other pony was poaching his guests, and ruining the carefully planned follow-up to last year that would secure his position as top pony in the social, as well as the noble hierarchy of Equestria.</p><p class="double">The fact that the ponies here clearly didn&#039;t understand the honour that had been bestowed on them by the personal presence of a princess, and for that matter his own presence, just put the exquisitely engraved sterling silver lid on it (he&#039;d never use anything so common as tin, not even in metaphors). The impertinence of that common farm-pony, that brutish pegasus shoving him into the mud, then soaking him and ruining his perfect mane-styling, and that unctuous unicorn making cow-eyes at him, some sort of seamstress who seemed to think her sense of taste would impress a princess.</p><p class="double">Then he&#039;d been attacked by a crowd of squawking monstrosities and that rabid pegasus. What sort of idiot thought that a bunch of birds was a suitable fanfare for a pony who raised the sun? Well, at least he would have the considerable pleasure of making sure they never got to inflict their indignities on Princess Celestia, and get some proper catering and party planning in from Canterlot. Despite the lateness of the day, he didn&#039;t anticipate much problem. Getting to serve the princess would be a considerable feather in their chapeaus, and they&#039;d undoubtedly remember the pony who&#039;d given them the chance in the future.</p><p class="double">His scheming... planning didn&#039;t prevent him instructing the mayor about his requirements. “... and I expect you to get a proper orchestra, not some bunch of birds and a lunatic pegasus!”</p><p class="double">“Everything was agreed well in advance, your highness. We have neither the time nor the money to change things now.” The mayor&#039;s voice was steady, but strained.</p><p class="double">“I am the Royal Overseer for this event and you will do as I say! I have been embarrassed, belittled, insulted and assaulted ever since I arrived in your squalid little hamlet...”</p><p class="double">Twilight knocked on the door with a hoof. The mayor&#039;s voice immediately cut across Blueblood&#039;s rant. “Come in!”</p><p class="double">Twilight entered, and the others trooped in after her. Blueblood immediately freaked. He&#039;d restored his original immaculate appearance, but he hadn&#039;t recovered his aplomb.</p><p class="double">“Sergeant! I told you I was not to be disturbed under any circumstances! Get those peasants out of here and consider yourself on report!”</p><p class="double">Sergeant Silverwing gave a a painfully text book salute and stared a hoof above and to the right of Blueblood&#039;s ear.. “Yes, your highness. Sorry, your highness, but we&#039;re not allowed to impede a civil servant in the course of her duties. Miss Codex has information that had to be brought to the mayor immediately. In fact she commandeered our services, under section 34a...”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t care! She&#039;s one of the ringleaders of this plan to humiliate me, they all are! They&#039;re nothing but a bunch of ringleaders!”</p><p class="double">Twilight decided it was time to interject. “I doubt we could do a better job than you&#039;ve done of humiliating yourself and bringing disgrace on the good name of the Royal family! Did you even bother to find out what your duties were before you came here, or did you just assume you could do whatever you wanted, as seems to be the case in Canterlot?”</p><p class="double">“How dare you speak to me like that! Do you know who I am?” The Prince stomped a hoof.</p><p class="double">“I think every-pony between here and Canterlot knows who you are, the way you&#039;ve been bellowing about it. However, no matter how big a wheel you are in Canterlot, your only role here is as the Royal Overseer for the Summer Sun Celebration, and that authority, and it&#039;s limitations are set out here.”</p><p class="double">She placed the copy of &#039;The Summer Sun Celebration – Duties and Responsibilities&#039; on the Mayors desk.</p><p class="double">“Chapter 2, paragraphs 12 through 22. The plan for the proposed Summer Sun Celebration is the responsibility of the mayor or other head of local government, to allow them to properly reflect the culture and capabilities of their locality. It is then approved by the Department of Culture and Recreation, and the Princess or her equerry on her behalf. Executive authority also rests with the local government.”</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare gave her a grateful smile. “That&#039;s what I&#039;ve been trying to tell him. I received the certifications over a month ago. I put Ponyville&#039;s very best ponies to arranging things.”</p><p class="double">The pones behind her preened, well Rarity and Rainbow Dash did.</p><p class="double">“I was Royal Overseer and ran the Summer Sun Celebration last year in Canterlot, so don&#039;t tell me I can&#039;t do the same here!”</p><p class="double">“In that case, Princess Celestia had probably delegated executive authority as well as the task of Royal Overseer to you. It makes sense, as she&#039;s the Grand Duchess of Canterlot and therefore the leader of the city council, but was probably far to busy to do the job herself.”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused and adjusted her glasses, letting that sink in. Blueblood hadn&#039;t bothered with the details of the paperwork, he had secretaries to deal with such things, so he couldn&#039;t say she was wrong. There had been a lot of paperwork too.</p><p class="double">“The rules as written don&#039;t give you the authority to change things, your role is purely administrative, to ensure that the plans are going ahead as required, and offer assistance if there has been some last minute slip-up. Not to try and change the agreed arrangements because they don&#039;t fit your personal tastes. The only reason you could cancel the Celebration would be in the case of gross failure to complete one of the tasks.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood sneered nastily and glanced out of the window. “Then I have you! Clearing the sky was one of the tasks, and it&#039;s still full of clouds...”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave Rainbow Dash a nod, and the pegasus made a hasty exit.</p><p class="double">“... so even if you can use some archaic legalisms that should have been edited out of the law books ages ago to weasel around your failure to provide a proper Summer Sun Celebration, you still can&#039;t get away from your failure to provide a clear sky as required!”</p><p class="double">Twilight saw Rainbow Dash appear at the window with a salute and a wide grin, and smirked. “Who says we haven&#039;t provided a clear sky?”</p><p class="double">She pointed at the window and Blueblood looked over at it, then did a double take and rushed over to look out at the clear blue sky. “But... that&#039;s impossible!”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash slipped back into the Mayor&#039;s office, panting slightly and stage whispered. “Ten seconds flat, I don&#039;t let my friends, or Ponyville, down.”</p><p class="double">“Oh! Oh!” Pinkie was practically bouncing up and down with excitement. “I guess that means... We can&#039;t have archaic and edit!”</p><p class="double">There were groans and chuckles all round, except for Blueblood who drew breath to start another rant, until Twilight decided to stare at him over her glasses. Under that withering gaze, he seemed to deflate.</p><p class="double">“In the process of grossly overstepping your authority, you have... what was your phrase? &#039;Embarrassed, belittled, insulted and assaulted&#039; the citizens of Ponyville for not acting as if your word was law. You treated Applejack like a serf, grossly insulted her entire family, acted like a complete boor to Rarity, had the nerve to send your guards after Rainbow Dash after she did her best to make up for crashing into you, and even verbally attacked Fluttershy! Her birds only swooped on you because you were attacking her, and it was quite clear they did that on their own. You are a poor excuse for a member of the nobility, let alone a relative of Princess Celestia&#039;s! And I have no doubt that she will be most displeased with your actions here today!”</p><p class="double">That seemed to finally hit home. He took a few steps back, head and ears down, and gave a sigh. “It&#039;s not like I wanted this job in the first place. I have my own party to plan in Canterlot. It was going to be the crown of the social season, the soiree that would affirm my position as the premier socialite in Canterlot. But when that boorish bookworm Twilight Sparkle had a conniption fit and ran away, who do you think was drafted in to fix her mess?”</p><p class="double">Twilight had been feeling good, even righteous over bringing Blueblood to book, in several senses of the word, but this suddenly hit her right in the gut. It seemed her friends weren&#039;t the only ones hit by the unintended consequences of her scheme. She was feeling sorry for Blueblood of all ponies! Yes, he was a stuck-up narcissistic prat, but he was still a pony, with hopes and dreams of his own.</p><p class="double">Some of his previous fire had returned. “I may not have wanted it, but since I was stuck with it, I was going to make sure this party was fit for a Princess! She deserves nothing less than the best, the same excellence she&#039;d get in Canterlot! But what&#039;s the use, I&#039;m stuck with all... this!”</p><p class="double">He tapped the checklist with it&#039;s crosses in a disgusted manner.</p><p class="double">Twilight made a decision. He wasn&#039;t stupid, whatever his other shortcomings. He was simply ignorant, and ignorance could be cured, by teaching.</p><p class="double">“If you truly believe that, then maybe you should consider this point. Princess Celestia chose Ponyville as the venue where she&#039;d raise the sun, not Canterlot. If she&#039;d wanted a Canterlot experience, wouldn&#039;t she just have stayed there? If you truly want to do what&#039;s best for the princess, maybe we can salvage this. If you&#039;ll just give these ponies a chance to prove that what they&#039;ve put together is the best that <i>Ponyville</i> has to offer, maybe you&#039;ll see that this is what the Princess wanted after all.”</p><p class="double">She turned to the other five.</p><p class="double">“I know this is a lot to ask, but will you give <i>him</i> a second chance? If you want we can make an official report of his conduct, see him punished for everything he put you through. But maybe we can do this a better way. I&#039;m sure you all wanted to prove that you did your very best, and there may still be a chance to do exactly that. However, it&#039;s up to you, one nay kills it.”</p><p class="double">Applejack shrugged. “Shoot, he were as ornery as a one eyed rattlesnake, but I figure the talking to you just gave him makes up for that. I only ever wanted to do this right and proper. I&#039;m in.”</p><p class="double">“He was absolutely rotten to me.” Rarity said with a superior expression that Blueblood himself would have envied. Then she softened. “However, I could understand if he had a certain artistic vision which my decorations didn&#039;t match. I would be interested to hear just what a Canterlot pony would do differently, rather than telling me what I&#039;d done was wrong. ”</p><p class="double">“Heh, it isn&#039;t any feather off my wings.” Rainbow Dash said, then looked over at the yellow pegasus. “But the way he went after Fluttershy, I figure he should get some come back for that. But if Fluttershy forgives him...”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy spoke quietly. “I... I don&#039;t mind as long as my birds get to sing at the Celebration. They&#039;ve worked so hard, and they&#039;re looking forward to performing for the Princess.”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle looked over towards the mayor. “Madam mayor?”</p><p class="double">“Very well.” The gray maned pony nodded.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned back to face Blueblood. “So, are you willing to give these ponies a chance?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie chipped in. “Don&#039;t mess with her, she has mysterious librarian powers!”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t have much of a choice.” Blueblood just hoofed over the checklist with a defeated sigh, and Twilight&#039;s horn glowed as she erased the crosses on it. As they came down into the main hall where the celebration was to be held, Rainbow Dash was drawn into a quiet conversation with Applejack and Twilight Sparkle, and went straight out the door before dusting off and heading away towards Canterlot at improbable speeds.</p><p class="double">Prince Blueblood noted it. “Where has she gone anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, just getting something from Canterlot for Applejack.” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a two hour flight even by chariot!” Blueblood exclaimed, and the two pegasus guards, who&#039;d actually flown it looked even more surprised.</p><p class="double">Applejack chuckled. “Not for Rainbow Dash when she gets a bee in her bonnet! She ain&#039;t called Dash for nothing!”</p><p class="double">“I begin to see how she cleared the sky so quickly...” He actually went to the doorway and outside to confirm what he&#039;d seen from the window, and view the receding polychromatic contrail. As he came back in, his horn glowed as he put quill to parchment, but this time, he placed a big tick in the tick box for clear sky.</p><p class="double">Rarity took center stage. “And now Prince Blueblood, let me explain why I made these choices, and then you can tell me what you would have done differently.”</p><p class="double">She started moving around. “The flowers on the balconies are common types grown around Ponyville, to symbolise the agriculture of the town, and the part the Princess plays by bringing forth the sun to help them grow. The hangings show the transition from night to day, and the ribbons are pure silk, and once again a graduated pattern for deep blues to bright orange to represent the sun-rise.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm...” This time, Blueblood actually listened. It helped that the other unicorn was no longer gushing over him like some over-eager debutante at a Canterlot ball. “I see... but the hangings are plain cotton. Why not silk?”</p><p class="double">“Cost, I&#039;m afraid the budget I was given by the mayor only went so far. But I created every stitch of them myself. I worked for days, crafting and reworking until I believed they were the best I could accomplish.”</p><p class="double">“But you had the money for gems... though not many, I&#039;ll admit.” He pointed a hoof to the balconies</p><p class="double">“From my own private stock.” Rarity replied. “I could have added more, but they would have made it look rather too gaudy, whereas I was going for elegant simplicity. The gems I have used are carefully positioned to illuminate and halo the Princess when the sun rises. This is her celebration, after all. It was something of a wrench to use so many of my finest gems, but when one has a vision, one must sometimes make sacrifices to bring it to life, no?”</p><p class="double">Blueblood moved forward, really examining the place for the first time. Fashion and art was an acceptable pastime, nay, a necessity in the fashion conscious society of Canterlot. “I understand what you&#039;re trying to do, but have you considered...”</p><p class="double">He started making suggestions, and Rarity listened. The pair soon got into a discussion of aesthetics, Blueblood&#039;s ideas sparking off Rarity&#039;s and vice-versa. Some changes were discarded, but others eagerly taken on board by the unicorn mare. Blueblood found he was actually enjoying himself, though when he found out just what they had to work with, blank shock was closer to the mark.</p><p class="double">Finally the agreed changes were all made, and the place looked wonderful. He levitated the checklist again. He put on a stern face. “I have considered the quality of the decorations, and the fineness of the materials, and I have no choice but to... give it my unashamed seal of approval.”</p><p class="double">He smirked at the way Rarity&#039;s expression had shifted as he&#039;d given his verdict. “Any-pony can make something spectacular with superior materials, managing to accomplish so much with so little... that is the mark of a true artist.”</p><p class="double">Fortunately, Twilight caught the unicorn mare as she fainted in relief. Once she recovered, they returned to Fluttershy&#039;s cottage, Pinkie bouncing along happily and singing, as the Prince traveling at a more sedate pace.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy, oh me oh my, mistress of creatures.</p><p class="double">Cares for all, both big and small, cute and fluffy!</p><p class="double">And that dear Prince is just why, she decided to try,</p><p class="double">To provide a wondrous,</p><p class="double">show you&#039;ll adore.</p><p class="double">Clearly splendiferous,</p><p class="double">Jaws hit the floor,</p><p class="double">As you listen to, her great chorus of,</p><p class="double">Birds that sing to the sky!</p><p class="double">Make way for Fluttershyyyy!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy dashed on ahead, cheeks blushing as Pinkie extolled her virtues. “Oh... my!”</p><p class="double">When they got there, she&#039;d already marshalled her birds, several of whom gave Prince Blueblood a very sharp stare. But Fluttershy calmed them down. “Now, now, I know we didn&#039;t get off to the best start, but I want you to sing, sing the best you&#039;ve ever sung! Show Prince Blueblood just how wonderful I know you are!”</p><p class="double">She lead them with a few notes and they joined in. The notes of the Royal fanfare embodied in bird-song, and no bird was going to disappoint Fluttershy by doing any less than their best. The jays sang the A&#039;s, the swallows didn&#039;t swallow their notes, and the tits hit every high note perfectly. It was a glorious chorus.</p><p class="double">At the end there was a silence more impressive than any amount of hoof-stomping or cheers. Twilight finally grinned. “Now tell me you&#039;ll find that anywhere in Equestria, even the Royal Canterlot Gardens?”</p><p class="double">“I...” Blueblood had a stunned look on his face. “I don&#039;t believe it!”</p><p class="double">“Like I said, every-pony has pulled out all the stops for this event.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood ticked the box for music, and Pinkie called out, “Woo hoo! Three down, one to go!”</p><p class="double">“And we&#039;ve saved the best till last!” Applejack exclaimed. As they approached Sweet Apple Acres, a rainbow blur approached it too, heading back from Canterlot. Rainbow Dash skidded to a halt by the party, tapping her saddlebag with a wingtip. “Okay, Codex, I got your special package right here.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Twilight conducted the Prince past the Apple family members, and into the same gazebo that she&#039;d had her own samples in. After a moment, Applejack came from the direction of the farm, carrying a tray with two plates and two slices of apple pie and a jug and glass of water.</p><p class="double">“Codex explained how you ponies in Canterlot are so fussed about watching your weight, so I figured fritters might not be the best thing to serve you. So I figured we&#039;d go with the basics, a slice of my own home made apple pie.”</p><p class="double">Twilight levitated the plates. “Just for comparison, I had Rainbow Dash go fetch a slice of apple pie from one of Canterlot&#039;s most expensive bakeries...” She put down a slender slice that had a red sauce drizzled over it and a small lump of ice-cream, “... to compare with Applejack&#039;s.“ She put down the other, which lacked the adornment.</p><p class="double">Blueblood sampled both of them, drinking a sip of water after each. Then he had some more. And some more, until there was nothing left but crumbs on either plate. He had a look of acute indecision on his face.</p><p class="double">Applejack saw it and said, “Sugar-cube, I don&#039;t know how my cooking holds up against that fancy Canterlot baking. All I know is I made the best durned apple pie I could. I ain&#039;t going to serve the princess anything less. So I ain&#039;t going to be offended by your honest opinion. At least you tried it.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood sighed, his eyes half lidded as he licked his lips. “It&#039;s not an easy choice. I have to admit that both of them were excellent. The pastry was delightfully flaky and melted in the mouth, and the filling was the perfect mix of sweet and tart. However, taking everything into account, I believe that one was better, though only slightly.”</p><p class="double">He pointed to the plate which still had traces of sauce.</p><p class="double">“Yeehaw!” Applejack hollered, and the Prince flinched. “I&#039;m mighty pleased to hear you say that, your highness, because that was my own home-made pie.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Prince Blueblood looked surprised. “But I thought that was the Canterlot pie!”</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. “I never said that, I only said we had the two for comparison. “The plain pie was from Canterlot. After all, you couldn&#039;t expect all that drizzled sauce to stay put while Rainbow Dash was flying back at full clip.”</p><p class="double">“I see...” Blueblood gave a frown which was unconvincing, as it tried to turn into a smirk. “You are a devious, devious pony, Miss Codex!”</p><p class="double">“You have no idea!” Twilight giggled again as he ticked the last box, and signed the checklist at the bottom.</p><p class="double">Twilgiht focused for a moment, and a copy appeared. “A duplicate for your records, Mayor Mare.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you Codex.” She glanced over at the guards. “I suggest you take Prince Blueblood home. I think he&#039;s had quite enough excitement for one day.”</p><p class="double">“Actually...” Twilight was loath to let the change in attitude go to waste. Blueblood had made an honest effort, and it was only fair he should be rewarded. “you said you were planning a party.”</p><p class="double">That killed the Prince&#039;s good mood. “I was, but it&#039;s too late now. I suspect by now most of my &#039;must invite&#039; list have made other arrangements. And it&#039;s too close to evening to get anything organised anyway.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm...” Twilight made a show of thinking. “How was your party going to be different from all those other ones, or the hundreds of others those ponies attended?”</p><p class="double">“I was going to host it.” Blueblood preened. “Though I&#039;ll admit finding something else unique to act as a draw gets hard. I had even considered Sapphire Shores, or one of the Wonderbolts, but even that&#039;s been done.”</p><p class="double">“Have you considered bringing it here?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“WHAT!” The response was pretty much universal.</p><p class="double">“Guys, think about it. You get to show off all your hard work, not just to the princess but a whole cart full of ponies from Canterlot. It couldn&#039;t hurt to have them think well of Ponyville.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, Codex, not every-pony is going to be as open minded as you are.” Applejack mused.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s not the done thing...” Blueblood added.</p><p class="double">“That might not be so bad.” Twilight responded. “You were saying that you were looking for something new. It&#039;s close, pretty much all you have to do is arrange transport, and the Princess herself will be here. After all, you already certified it was good enough for her, you even had a horn in the decorations so they should have no complaints.”</p><p class="double">“You have a point... Yes, I can see how to pitch it. The princess would be a big draw, and I can play up the difference. Prince Blueblood is a trend-setter, not some-pony who just follows the herd. It would be daring, avant-garde... I like this idea!”</p><p class="double">“Uh... that&#039;s well and all, but I still don&#039;t know if they&#039;ll get on alright with us regular ponies.”</p><p class="double">“I can assure that.” Prince Blueblood said with a grin bordering on evil. “No-pony will want to embarrass the princess, or themselves by suggesting that some-thing she approved is not good enough for them. And if they prove intransigent, I&#039;ll simply set Codex here on them!”</p><p class="double">That had Twilight blushing as her friends laughed. After Blueblood was escorted out, Pinkie bounced up. “You know what this calls for? A party!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s your answer to everything!” Applejack exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s because it&#039;s a good answer!” Pinkie beamed back. “We still have to welcome Codex properly, and I&#039;ve invited a lot of other ponies to meet her. Mayor Mare, are you coming too?”</p><p class="double">“You go on ahead.” The mayor gave a tired smile. “I&#039;ll look in later.”</p><p class="double">“Okie Dokie Lokie!” She grabbed Twilight by the hoof. “C&#039;mon, Princess Celestia&#039;s going to lower the sun soon, we can watch the twilight sparkle!”</p><p class="double">That got Twilight doing a double take, but she just shook her head and let the pink pony lead her away. As Twilight partied with her new friends, she thought back to the earlier party, and then to Spike, her ostensible reason for going. While it had started as just a ploy, realising how much it had meant to Spike had made it more than that.</p><p class="double">This whole business with Blueblood had made her reconsider just how she was affecting every-pony with her plan, not just the Princess. She keenly felt his absence at her side, despite the fact that it was only temporary. She also wondered if her letter to him had been clear enough. He was, after all, only a baby dragon, and might not be able to accept being left behind easily, even for a short while.</p><p class="double">She quickly came to a decision, and got Rarity off to one side. &quot;Yes, Codex darling?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... do you have any blue garnets lying around? I want to send some to a very dear friend in Canterlot, I had to leave without saying goodbye properly and it worries me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course dear, I have plenty. Take what you need.&quot;</p><p class="double">“Um... I don&#039;t want you to think I&#039;m not accepting them in the generous spirit they were given, but if it&#039;s all the same to you, I&#039;d like to find a way to repay you, to earn them. It&#039;s because I want to give them to my friend, and getting them without working for them feels like cheating.”</p><p class="double">Rarity was silent for a moment, and Twilight thought she might have made a huge mistake, but then the white unicorn smiled. “Of course dear, I understand. The value of a gift is the work you put into getting it. If you want to help out, I have several months of receipts and bills I need to organise and file. As a matter of fact, I&#039;ve been putting it off, as it&#039;s something I don&#039;t enjoy at all.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled brightly. “That sounds perfect!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike was deep in his second tub of Rocky Road when he felt a burp coming on. A flash of flame released a scroll, but not one of Celestia&#039;s. Several blue garnets, one of his favourite gemstones spilled out as he opened it, but it was the text that held his attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Spike,</p><p class="double">I said I&#039;d be in contact as soon as possible. I know gemstones aren&#039;t much of a replacement for a hug, but could you consider the other a given? I&#039;ve managed to settle in, and I&#039;m doing well, but things are so <i>different</i> here. I&#039;ve been thinking, and I may have been wrong to rush off. I was just too ashamed to face Celestia right then, but I should have at least have stayed to take my lumps in person rather than running away.</p><p class="double">Sometimes, having to face a problem head on is the only right thing to do, I learned that while I was here. I will come back and face her after the Summer Sun Celebration. Things are crazy here at the moment, and she&#039;s probably far too busy with her own preparations to have time for me right now. Know that just because we&#039;re apart, it doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t think of you, and hope we can be back together as soon as possible.</p><p class="double">Your friend,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle.&#039;</p><p class="double">Spike read the message again, then held it to his chest as a great weight seemed to vanish from inside it. Twilight hadn&#039;t abandoned him. He hadn&#039;t realised Twilight even knew the flame-mail spell, but then who could keep up with everything Twilight was studying? He eagerly started off to go show Princess Celestia the message, she&#039;d want to know about it. Then he came back, scooped up the garnets in his ice cream tub. After all, she had sent them especially for him, and Rocky Road went well with Garnets.</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia was indeed pleased to receive the letter, and not just because it told her Twilight was doing well. However, it seemed Spike couldn&#039;t target a reply. She performed a series of magical tests of her own and discovered that Twilight hadn&#039;t cast the flame-mail spell perfectly after all. It seemed she hadn&#039;t fully taken into account the heft of the garnets, and the wobble it had imparted to the virtual catenary of the letter had wiped out any trace of a return path. There was no way to back track it and find out where in Equestria she was.</p><p class="double">“Spike, I think you should take this letter to Shining Armour too. He and his parents must be worried about Twilight too.”</p><p class="double">It was getting towards evening, when she&#039;d have to raise the moon. For a thousand years, her sister&#039;s face stared down at her in reproach at her not having saved her from the darkness that had consumed her. For a moment she considered altering it&#039;s course to disrupt the conjunction, but that would cause a dreadful magical backlash that could cause at least as much chaos as her sister&#039;s return. Besides, this conjunction would not be possible for another 1000 years, and to leave her sister up there for that long...</p><p class="double">&#039;Forgive me, my subjects...&#039; Celestia thought. &#039;… I have to trust in Shining Armour and that Twilight will find a way to save you all. I can only play my part to help them.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>21.2 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">Twilight gazed out through the bars of the enclosure as she ran through her start-of-loop checklist.</p><p class="double"><i>Not the baseline start point...pretty sure this isn&#039;t Equestria...standard equiform body type...I appear to be my default self...Wait. What&#039;s that squeaking noise?</i></p><p class="double">She looked behind her to see Pinkie Pie trotting along in a giant exercise wheel.</p><p class="double">Or was it that she and Pinkie were in miniature and the wheel and the...cage?...surrounding them was normal sized? That big water bottle suspended on one side of the enclosure seemed to support the latter theory.</p><p class="double">Beyond the bars, on the surface (counter?) nearby was an enormous bundle of paper in an equally enormous clipboard. She could just make out the stationary header on the top page: &quot;ACME Labs&quot;.</p><p class="double">As the loop-specific memories/background finally arrived, Pinkie chirped, &quot;Gee Twi...What do you want to do tonight?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Just run with it</i>, she decided with a mental shrug. &quot;The same thing we do every night, Pinkie...Try to take over the world!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>They&#039;re Pinkie and the Brain</i></p><p><i>Yes, Pinkie and the Brain</i></p><p><i>One is a genius</i></p><p><i>The other&#039;s insane</i></p><p><i>They&#039;re ponies in a cage</i></p><p><i>The unicorn&#039;s a mage</i></p><p><i>They&#039;re dinky</i></p><p><i>They&#039;re Pinkie and the Brain, Brain, Brain, Brain...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Narf!&quot; added Pinkie for no particular reason.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">21.3</p><p class="double">“Right, Fillies and gentlecolts,” Twilight said, then paused. “Er, I mean, girls and Spike. Anyway.” The mare tapped her board with a swagger stick. “We face a terrifying reality.”</p><p class="double">Her wings flapped once for emphasis. “I am a pegasus, with the talent of magic, and my Element of Magic is a necklace here.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we noticed,” Dash said.</p><p class="double">“Furthermore,” Twilight continued, ignoring her, “Applejack is a unicorn.” Another pause. “And I have to say, those giant apples you’ve been making so far this loop are delicious. Something to follow up on, if you can still pull it off.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks,” the currently-a-unicorn said cheerfully.</p><p class="double">“Both Dash and Rarity are earth ponies. And I don’t know how this version of you got her cutie mark-”</p><p class="double">Dash cut in again. “I run kinda like that Sonic guy. I can run across water, which makes these rainbow-gemmed sprays of water. Kinda looks neat.”</p><p class="double">“Think you can break the sound barrier?” Twilight asked, then shook her head. “Sorry, stupid question, of course you can. We’re getting off topic.”</p><p class="double">“There’s a topic?” Spike asked, his arm around Rarity. “We’re just saying stuff we already know!”</p><p class="double">“I am aware of that.” Twilight tapped her swagger stick again. “But I want to make my conclusions totally clear. Now, Fluttershy is the only one of us who has kept her base-form aside from Spike. And, as far as my experiences have shown, we Elements tend to be a two-two-two mix of the three baseline pony types. At <i>first</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we know Pinkie’s a unicorn,” Spike pointed out. “We all met her so far this Loop.”</p><p class="double">“And she’s not Awake,” Twilight pointed out. “Now, since she’s not Awake, and <i>her</i> Element is the crown, for… unknown reasons…” she trailed off.</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Applejack said slowly. “Didn’t y’all once say that, if the one with the tiara for an Element wasn’t Awake…”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” Twilight pressed a button, and the projector showed an image of Princess Pinkie Pie. Then it changed to show a long list of titles.</p><p class="double">“This was obtained from the Hub Loop,” Twilight said, pointing at the top. “These two are the events with Nightmare Moon – which we’ve already handled, of course. The remaining sixty-three episodes are the significant events to happen before and leading up to P-day.”</p><p class="double">“Girls,” Twilight finished, “this is the countdown to our breakdown. May Celestia help us all.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>22.1</p><p class="double">“Trixie,” Twilight said, blocking two incoming crossbow bolts, “what the hay did you <i>do?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Trixie is not sure,” the blue unicorn replied, curving a stun bolt over their barricade. “She was just engaging in the usual early-loop run of sell-out performances to build spending money, and then suddenly a hit squad.”</p><p class="double">“There must be more to it than that.”</p><p class="double">“Well, don’t look at me.” Trixie rummaged in one of her hat’s hidden pockets, then waved something around. “This is the only unfamiliar thing I can find…”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at it. “What the hay? That’s the Crystal Heart!”</p><p class="double">“It is?” Trixie rotated it, and Twilight found herself forced to resort to a brute force bunker shield as her friend abruptly dropped everything else to focus on examining the small crystal.</p><p class="double">“It is indeed,” Trixie concluded after almost a minute. “Despite the size. Well, we would appear to have been dropped right in the middle of a thriller plot.”</p><p class="double">They shared glances.</p><p class="double">“Dibs I be the nutty but well armed one!” Trixie shouted.</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah, that was a given,” Twilight allowed. “Guess I’ll have to be the quiet, bookish one who analyzes things.”</p><p class="double">“We need a third member,” Trixie muttered. “Hmmm…”</p><p class="double">“Oi!” a griffin shouted at them. “Are you going to bother paying attention to us, or…”</p><p class="double">Both unicorns fired stun spells at once.</p><p class="double">Twilight went for subtlety, weaving in a viral component which bounced between the various other ponies and griffins forming the hit squad, neutralizing them all with minimal effort.</p><p class="double">Then Trixie’s spell connected, and sent him flying out the window.</p><p class="double">“Overenthusiastic warlock,” Twilight teased.</p><p class="double">“Petty efficiency-focused mage,” Trixie rejoined.</p><p class="double">“You’re right, we do need someone else.” Twilight then blinked. “And I know just the pony.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You see,” Sombra said silkily, trotting in a circle around the two unicorns, “The Crystal Heart is the most powerful magical artefact known to pony kind.”</p><p class="double">“Seventh!” Twilight interrupted.</p><p class="double">“Eighth,” Trixie replied. “I found one of those ones from the Daring Do stories once-”</p><p class="double">“The prattle of small minds.” Sombra shook his head, and turned away from the manacled ponies. “But I have no more concerns. You are trapped, your magic is blocked, and my triumph is at hand.”</p><p class="double">Trixie sniggered. “You are asking for it <i>so</i> much.”</p><p class="double">“Do go on,” Sombra invited. “It’s another minute until the ritual reaches the crescendo, so I can spare the time for a moment’s amusement.”</p><p class="double">“And again!” The showpony shrugged. “But if you want to keep doing that, go ahead. It’ll just make the irony more funny.”</p><p class="double">“I’m afraid all the ironic amusement will be on my side,” Sombra gloated, still in that icily smooth voice which sounded so wrong to Twilight. “For nothing can stop me now!”</p><p class="double">At that point, Luna broke through the ceiling.</p><p class="double">“Told you,” Trixie said smugly.</p><p class="double">“WE HAVE ARRESTED HIM!” Luna boomed out. “AGENT T, WE DID IT! DOES THIS MEAN WE ARE NO LONGER PROBATIONARY?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked. It had taken some fast talking with her brother to get Trixie and herself officially enlisted into his Guard unit, and then more to keep them off the books… but the result was that they were basically the Mares in Black.</p><p class="double">Though it did kind of suck that, since Luna would have to be L, and that left Trixie with T, she had to be content with being agent S.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Trixie answered Luna. “Well done, agent Elle.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, who’s going to be coming after that thing next?” Twilight asked speculatively, as the regular guard moved in on what used to be Sombra’s base of operations.</p><p class="double">“Trixie has no idea. And she still can’t get it to go away.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Luna both sniggered. Neither of them knew why the Crystal Heart followed Trixie around either (and Twilight hoped it wouldn’t last past the Loop), but it was funny. Especially that time someone tried to steal it, and it had just vanished from his saddlebags to reappear in her hat.</p><p class="double">“Actually,” Luna said, remembering to keep her voice down this time, “We have heard rumours that the Changelings seek the gem. Again.”</p><p class="double">“What, really?” Trixie frowned. “This Chrysalis is unusually persistent. This is, what, the seventh time?”</p><p class="double">“Sixth, I think,” Twilight said. “That lot in Neighagra Falls were just local, part of an emotion smuggling ring. No, I don’t know how you smuggle an emotion either.”</p><p class="double">“What do you think she’ll send this time?” Trixie mused. “Cut price ninja changelings again?”</p><p class="double">“Who knows.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">22.2</p><p class="double">“Okay, somepony up there’s <i>got</i> to be playing a joke on me.”</p><p class="double">Twilight surveyed the field from her office window. One absolutely colossal building. A long runway, easily five miles long. A much smaller runway which led to a pair of gantries and a blast trap.</p><p class="double">And dozens of little green men in spacesuits waiting expectantly for her to tell them what to do.</p><p class="double">“Right,” she said eventually, and started for the Vertical Assembly Building. “Time to introduce these… <i>Kerbals</i>, to the concept of a wind tunnel.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She felt quite smug, as the enormous rocket was finally moved out onto the launch pad. It wasn’t an SSTO launcher, those would still take a while to perfect, but it should be fine for a moon shot.</p><p class="double">“Everything ready?”</p><p class="double">“One hundred percent!” Jebediah said, saluting. “Rocket fuelled and ready to-”</p><p class="double">Then there was a bang.</p><p class="double">When Twilight’s hearing returned it was raining bits of rocket, Kerbals in extremely tough space suits, and even large amounts of dirt washed up in the blast.</p><p class="double">“Oh, come on!” she shouted, as a Kerbal bounced past – he’d be fine, he landed on his head. “What even caused that?”</p><p class="double">Jebediah shrugged. “Just happens sometimes. Well known fact, one in five fuel reserves just randomly explode if looked at funny.” The Kerbal clapped Twilight on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, it’s just how the world works. Hell, it doesn’t even matter if they’re full or not – I once saw a rocket run out of fuel on the launchpad, then explode hard enough to send the Kerbalnaut into orbit anyway.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Right.”</i> Twilight shook her head sadly. “Oh, well, back to the drawing board.”</p><p class="double">“You could always just build a plane with five hundred ailerons,” Jebediah suggested. “Flap them to take off.”</p><p class="double">“Would that even work?” At his nod, Twilight’s expression turned thoughtful. “I don’t know what you have for physics here, but it seems exploitable…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">22.3</p><p class="double">“Huh,” Twilight said, looking over at her ‘sister’. “I have to admit, I’m surprised this one took so long to come up…”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. “I wondered if it was possible at all, given your descriptions of the various other loops with recent alicorns. But here we are.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Twilight’s horn glowed as she enforced a chaos negation spell. “Any particular plans?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, actually,” Celestia said. “I want to show you all the tricks of being a ruler that you might have missed.”</p><p class="double">“…Princess…” Twilight began, “I’ve done loops like this at least a dozen times. I’m pretty much certain that I’m, technically, older than you by now. By quite a lot.”</p><p class="double">“There’s always something to learn.” Celestia smiled mysteriously.</p><p class="double">“Oh, knock it off with the Dumbledore stuff.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I can’t tell if this is a good idea or a bad one…” Twilight mused.</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Celestia asked, passing Twilight a hard hat (complete with hole for the horn). “I know I’ve never had the time to see what’s at the core of the planet.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, it is interesting stuff…” Twilight paused, then pointed. “But just over there is a gateway to Tartarus.”</p><p class="double">“Eh.” Celestia shrugged. “Alright, get digging!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, that’s another hydra…” Twilight trotted over, the monster bobbing along in a telekinetic field. “Three heads, this one.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Celestia replied, taking the monster. “But we appear to have a problem. They keep escaping through the hole.”</p><p class="double">“So we need to rebuild the ceiling of Tartarus?” Twilight asked. “Is that what you’re saying?”</p><p class="double">“Not quite.” Celestia focused, and then the hydra went flying moon-wards.</p><p class="double">“Let’s see them escape from <i>that</i>,” she said smugly.</p><p class="double">“You… kind of like sending things to the moon, don’t you?” Twilight said rhetorically. “Good thing Luna isn’t around right now, I’m sure she’d protest.”</p><p class="double">“Go find some of those Scylla that escaped,” Celestia instructed. “Try looking in the ocean.”</p><p class="double">“So, what you’re trying to teach me is..?”</p><p class="double">“Clean up after your own mistakes.” Celestia replied smoothly. “Which is why I’m making you do it.”</p><p class="double">“Right, lesson learned, fob off boring tasks on your students…” Twilight shot back.</p><p class="double">“It’s called postgraduate work.” Celestia winked.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">22.4</p><p class="double">“Nice to see you, Rarity and Sweetie,” Twilight said, ticking off another pair of names. “Start line’s over there – and no panicking, Rarity!”</p><p class="double">“Perish the thought!” Rarity said, looking down at her little sister. “We’re going to do as well as possible – and if that dreadful mud looks like being a problem, well, I have designed my outfit to be mud resistant!”</p><p class="double">“How come you didn’t make mine mud resistant?” Sweetie asked.</p><p class="double">“You’re not wearing anything.” Rarity pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah… but I could have been!”</p><p class="double">Twilight watched the unicorns walk off bickering for a moment or two longer. That was another wrinkle that Rarity had learned to carefully smooth over, then.</p><p class="double">“Alright, who’s next – Princess Celestia?!”</p><p class="double">Heads turned, some of them with the attached jaws dropping.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” that alicorn asked, her eyes dancing. “Is there a problem?”</p><p class="double">“Why didn’t you tell me?” Twilight asked, the question having more than one layer.</p><p class="double">As did the answer. “I wanted to surprise you. Anyway – Luna! Luna?”</p><p class="double">The black princess trotted over from a table of refreshments. “We particularly enjoy indulging Ourselves in this thing you call ‘toffee’.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked sideways at Celestia. “Her too?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed,” Celestia replied mysteriously. “Now, I and my sister wish to enter.”</p><p class="double">“…sure, why not. You’re sisters, after all.” Twilight pointed to the two of them. “You know the rules, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Celestia rattled them off, and Twilight checked the list.</p><p class="double">“Well, you seem all set, then. Just one reminder – when it says no use of magic or wings in the foot race, that <i>is</i> a rule. It’s basically for fairness.”</p><p class="double">“Hah!” Luna said, drumming her hooves on the floor. “I think we shall be fine.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight said, as she heaved an incredibly muddy Luna out of a sink hole. “For reference? Spreading wings when you’re tripping into mud just increases the surface area.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I know that <i>now</i>…” Luna muttered. “This is so embarrassing.”</p><p class="double">“Well, Celestia’s still down there.” Twilight sluiced Luna down with water. “That should get the worst off. Hey, er… how long can alicorns last without air?”</p><p class="double">“Indefinitely.” Luna then turned back to the pool. “But it isn’t exactly pleasant. I suggest you extract my sister soon.”</p><p class="double">“Are you two just denser, or something?” As she spoke, Twilight began to lift the entire sinkhole out of the ground and summoned up a bubble of water to wash Celestia off.</p><p class="double">“Our hooves are essentially normal size, and we weigh rather a lot more than a normal pony – especially without passive magic to reduce the weight a bit.” Luna went off, presumably to ask for a cloud.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Pfffffeh!” Celestia sniffled. “Not one of my better ideas…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, and spoke in a whisper. “I know full well alicorns are more durable than that – no mere dunking will give you a cold.” She paused. “You did that deliberately, didn’t you?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Mostly </i>deliberately.” Celestia spat more muddy residue out. “But yes, I never really intended to win.”</p><p class="double">“Can’t blame you…” Twilight replied, watching Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo celebrating. “I know they’re not <i>really</i> sisters, but they both insisted.”</p><p class="double">Luna came over with eight cups of hot chocolate. “Four for you, Celly. Goodness, but we screwed that one up…”</p><p class="double">“Speak for yourself.” Celestia drank the first mug. “Oh, I needed that.”</p><p class="double">“We planned on coming just behind the leaders, not getting sunk into a <i>bog!”</i> Luna hissed.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, and left the sisters to their argument.</p><p class="double">Strange how that part of having a sibling worked…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">22.5 (more Turning the Tables, from Stainless Steel Fox) </p><p class="double"></p><p>“Thanks Rarity.” Twilight said as the group walked towards the Town hall. “That puts my mind at ease a bit.”</p><p class="double">“Think nothing of it.” The white mare waved her thanks away with a hoof. “I just wish you weren&#039;t being so mysterious about it. Is this some-pony a colt-friend? Is he the one you left Canterlot over?”</p><p class="double">“No, just a dear friend.” Twilight decided it was time to let some of the back-story out, to cushion when she was ready to tell everything. Besides, she felt it was what her in-loop self would do. “And he wasn&#039;t the one I disappointed. I had a very responsible position, and I failed in my duties. I thought it was only a small thing, helping my friend out, but clearly I was wrong.</p><p class="double">“I left something undone for a few hours while I went off, but I honestly thought it wouldn&#039;t make a difference. It wasn&#039;t time critical, just some research about old legends. I still don&#039;t know what was so important about it... When I was called to answer for my mistake, I couldn&#039;t take it. I resigned, left Canterlot altogether, told myself it was better to avoid causing further embarrassment.”</p><p class="double">She hung her head. “I&#039;m beginning to realise that it was a selfish option, and a cowardly one. I should have stayed, taken my lumps, even if the end result would most likely have been the same, leaving Canterlot in disgrace. After the Summer Sun Celebration I&#039;ll go back, find out exactly what was so terrible about what I didn&#039;t get done, and face whatever punishment I have coming. I just hope I have here to come back to afterwards.”</p><p class="double">Applejack looked at her askance and asked, “No-pony got hurt did they?”</p><p class="double">“NO!” Twilight exclaimed. She felt guilty in that it wasn&#039;t exactly true, the whole mess with Blueblood, Spike being left alone, there had been several people hurt. “Not directly, anyway, but I&#039;m beginning to realise that my leaving may have hurt quite a few people. I swear, I never imagined any-pony would get hurt or I&#039;d never have left my library!”</p><p class="double">That was the truth. Even Celestia would ultimately have come out of it wiser, however much she might be worried in the short term. Applejack looked closely at the pale blue unicorn, and finally nodded her head. “I guess that&#039;s fine. Though I&#039;d like to know the full story.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie bounced up and down. “Oh oh! I bet she&#039;s Twilight Sparkle and the princess is the one she disappointed, and that the old legends are some secret for stopping some massive evil thingie that&#039;s going to appear...”</p><p class="double">She came to a halt with a puzzled expression. “No, wait, if that was the case, why would the Princess want to send her to Ponyville rather than keeping her in the library to finish her research? Silly me!”</p><p class="double">She slapped the side of her head with her hoof as Twilight goggled. Then she gave a sigh. “Well, you got the first bit right.”</p><p class="double">That managed to produce as fine a crop of double-takes as had ever been seen. She waved a hoof to stop the inevitable exclamations.</p><p class="double">“But please, can every-pony keep it to themselves? I&#039;m known as Codex here, and I&#039;d like to have a bit more time to be just Codex before I have to deal with whatever Twilight Sparkle has coming. But you&#039;re also right, if there was some big threat on the horizon, Princess Celestia would surely have told me right out, given me time to prepare.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash flew down beside Pinkie Pie. “But how the hey did you figure that out?”</p><p class="double">“Well, duh!” The pink pony exclaimed. “We get told about a pony who&#039;d vanished from Canterlot mysteriously by Blueblood, obviously it&#039;s foreshadowing the big reveal that the pony is our new friend who comes from Canterlot and appeared mysteriously.”</p><p class="double">“And my friend is a baby dragon called Spike, and blue garnets are his favourite food.” Twilight added.</p><p class="double">“Oh my!” Fluttershy was suddenly beside her, and beside herself. “You have a baby dragon?”</p><p class="double">“He was my number one assistant. I take care of him,and vice versa. I&#039;ll try and set up a chance to meet him, if Princess Celestia lets me anywhere near him after the way I messed up.”</p><p class="double">Twilight was surprised when she reached the Town Hall and saw Shining Armour there as part of the Royal Guard detail. Not only was his presence a surprise, but the fact that he his uniform clearly identified him as Captain of the Guard. That shouldn&#039;t have happened for several months yet... Then her in-loop memories told her that it had happened, and that she&#039;d just sent a note congratulating him.</p><p class="double">&#039;Princess Celestia was right about one thing, I desperately needed to get out and make some friends. Just a note? For my BBBFF? Some LSBFF I turned out to be. I was well on my way to going completely Starswirl!&#039;</p><p class="double">She took pride in the fact that he didn&#039;t give her a second glance as she went in the main doors with her new friends. There were other changes, a couple of small but elegant air-boats and a couple of fancy carriages parked nearby. Blueblood was inside, making small talk with a number of wealthy looking unicorns and earth-ponies, she recognised Fancy Pants and Fleur De Lys among them, and along with Filthy Rich.</p><p class="double">Events inside unfolded as they had a hundred times before, Fluttershy conducted her bird chorus fanfare, the mayor gave her speech, and Twilight watched out of the corner of her eye as the four stars of the conjunction approached the moon, and vanished behind it, causing the image of the mare in the moon to disappear.</p><p class="double">Her magical senses were far more acute than they&#039;d once been, and the passive magical detection spell she&#039;d cast didn&#039;t hurt. She could feel the bright shining beacon of Princess Celestia&#039;s aura, hidden away in the back room behind the curtains, and the surge as it was engulfed and extinguished by the shadowed aura of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">“...Princess Celestia!”</p><p class="double">The gasps of shock as the opened curtains revealed the total lack of Princesses or a reasonable facsimile were as nothing to the shock and awe as a cloud of star-shot purple mist appeared on the dias and resolved itself into Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">“Oh, my beloved subjects. It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve seen your precious, little sun-loving faces.”</p><p class="double">Standard speech, same old, same old... wait, there were more pegasus guards than usual, and they were manoeuvring dark clouds into position in the rafters.</p><p class="double">“What have you done with our Princess!” Rainbow Dash yelled, charging, and was as always restrained by Applejack.</p><p class="double">Blueblood of all ponies joined in. “Yes, tell us where she is at once!”</p><p class="double">The mare no longer in the moon chuckled. “Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don&#039;t you know who I am?”</p><p class="double">“Ooh, ooh, more guessing games! Um, Hokey Smokes! How about... Queen Meanie!” Pinkie Pie exclaimed. “No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty!”</p><p class="double">“Wrong, she&#039;s obviously a crazy party-crashing Nightmare Night reject.” Twilight suggested. “Go home! You&#039;re months early! And those wings and horn look fake! Get off-stage and let the Princess get out!”</p><p class="double">While she was calling the villain out, she also scooped up Fluttershy with her telekinesis and brought them down to the main floor. She was about to do the same for Rarity when her brother&#039;s horn glowed and swept her down to him. Rarity realised who&#039;d carried her away and looked worshipfully at him.</p><p class="double">“Yeah! Tell us where the Princess is!” “Boo!” “Spoilsport!” “Lame!” The other ponies started heckling her. The three future crusaders started throwing candy at her. Meanwhile the guards on the ground were clearly moving into position at a signal from Shining Armour.</p><p class="double">The look on Nightmare Moon&#039;s face went from smug to furious, and lightning cracked around her, silencing every-pony. “I will not stand for this disrespect! I am Nightmare Moon! Sister of Celestia and Princess of all Equestria!”</p><p class="double">“You lost any right to that title a millennium ago, when you turned on your sister and the ponies you were supposed to protect, and tried to bring eternal night!” Shining Armour had stepped forward, horn glowing. Twilight felt the Message spell trigger as he said, more quietly. “Sergeant, clear the civilians out.”</p><p class="double">Twilight suddenly realised what this all meant. He couldn&#039;t be thinking...</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was too wrapped up in her boasting to see the movement in the crowd below her. “And this time I shall! My oh so precious sister is bound in the sun, where she will stay! I control the sun and moon now, and I will do so, forever!”</p><p class="double">Lightning crackled around her again, but Shining Armour called out, “Not on my watch! Luna, once Princess of Equestria and self-styled Nightmare Moon, you are hereby charged with high treason, the assault and kidnapping of Princess Celestia and making hackneyed villain speeches! Surrender or we will use force!”</p><p class="double">Oh dear Celestia! Her brother was going to try and arrest her!</p><p class="double">“Ha!” Nightmare Moon sneered. “You pathetic ponies should be taking my orders!”</p><p class="double">“Very well, all pegasi fire! Full charge!” A dozen massive lightning bolts jumped from the cloud and enveloped Nightmare Moon. The balcony was splintered in seconds, too fast to even catch fire, and Shining Armour, and two other unicorns of the Royal Guard who&#039;d been standing well back came together and cast a purple containment shield that closed around her. Prince Blueblood charged up a few seconds later, horn glowing, but Shining Armour waved him off with a hoof. “Don&#039;t, you&#039;ll destabilise it... help get every-pony out of here!”.</p><p class="double">For a wild moment Twilight wondered if they could actually do it, then felt Nightmare Moon&#039;s power surge. This was far more than her usual casual lightning slap to knock away the guards sent to seize her. She was drawing power from somewhere, enough to respond with enough power to burn out their horns, maybe even kill them.</p><p class="double">The sky outside lightened towards pre-dawn, and she made the connection. Celestia must still be fighting to break free! But it wouldn&#039;t be in time to save her brother! Without further thought she jumped in beside him and covered them with a shield of her own, just as the purple sphere enclosing Nightmare Moon shattered and a blast of dark energy surged from her horn to strike at them.</p><p class="double">It spent it&#039;s energy smashing the shield, shattering into smaller streamers and sending the four unicorns sprawling backwards, but Nightmare Moon looked visibly weaker afterwards. She turned her face to the lightening horizon with an expression of fear and hate. Her horn glowed a fierce black, and the sky darkened again, but it clearly exhausted her. Before any-pony could do anything about it, she turned into a cloud of black mist and swept away.</p><p class="double">“uhhh...” Shining Armour shook his head as he pulled himself up. “Thank you miss... You saved our lives.”</p><p class="double">Twilight was pony-piled by her friends. “Codex dear, are you alright!” “Whoa! That was awesome!” “Ohh ohh! Do it again!”</p><p class="double">Twilight lifted herself to her feet with a glow of her horn and shook herself. Her pince-nez glasses were missing and her mane was in disarray. “Cast another shield right now! Expand it out to cover the Town Hall and encompass every-pony.”</p><p class="double">“Uh... what?” asked the confused unicorn stallion.</p><p class="double">“Now, please!” She pleaded. He cast the spell and another bubble expanded out from his horn, engulfing the others and expanding. As he did, her horn glowed and she added her own spell to the flow of power. The spell passed through the walls of the town hall, and the sky outside seemed to lighten, triggering gasps of awe from many of the ponies.</p><p class="double">The mayor had managed to make her way over, glancing up at the dawn light outside the windows. “What did you just do? Did you just raise the sun?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid not.” Twilight sighed. “I just added a daylight effect to the interior of Shining Armour&#039;s spell. That Nightmare Moon seemed terrified of the dawn. If she is a creature of night, she should be unable to snoop inside this bubble, for as long as it lasts.”</p><p class="double">“That was some pretty ingenious spell-work, miss...”</p><p class="double">“Codex.” That would do for now. To be honest, she was half ready to give up the whole deception, but now wasn&#039;t the time for long explanations. “It&#039;s only a stop-gap measure, but it&#039;s all I could come up with. We need time to prepare, time to research, to figure out how to stop her. Even a unicorn triune couldn&#039;t contain her, though it&#039;s clear she&#039;s using power for something else.”</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Miss Codex,&quot; the Royal Guard Captain said, &quot;you remind me a lot of my little sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity wilted a bit. The oh-so-dashing stallion was interested in the librarian instead.</p><p class="double">&quot;I should. I&#039;d say that I know Twilight Sparkle pretty well.&quot; Twilight said. &quot;After all, she spends a lot of time in the library.&quot;</p><p class="double">That perked Rarity right up. This was Twilight&#039;s brother? That had possibilities...</p><p class="double">Shining Armor smiled. &quot;You&#039;re one of Twilie&#039;s friends? That&#039;s great! To be honest, Mom, Dad, and I have been worried that she wasn&#039;t getting out much. Even Cadie&#039;s worried...&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s defeat was total. She could hear the affection in that pet name... This was just. The. Worst. Possible. Thing....</p><p class="double">That was quickly overshadowed by a cry from Applejack. She was standing by an oddly shaped bush, no a pair of bushes, one wrapped around another almost protectively. It was like natural topiary, in the shape of two ponies, a bigger one shielding the smaller one, with a familiar red bow bound into it&#039;s branches.</p><p class="double">“I saw her run back in... Big Mac tried to fetch her, and then they were hit by one of those splashes of magic when it broke on your shield...” The earth-pony was distraught.</p><p class="double">Twilight was stricken. Things had really gotten out of control. She cast a quick diagnostic spell and heaved a big sigh of relief. “They&#039;re alive and aware, just trapped in those forms. Nightmare Moon must have wanted trophies she could gloat over. It should be possible to turn them back...”</p><p class="double">“Then do it!” Applejack demanded.</p><p class="double">Twilight could do it, but only by going full alicorn. The best in-loop Twilight could do was... “A unicorn can&#039;t overpower alicorn magic, and Princess Cadence isn&#039;t a magic specialist. I can give them mobility, alter the transformation. It shouldn&#039;t affect turning them back when we have the power available...”</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and the two tree shapes shifted, twisted. They fell apart, then got to their hooves, or rather paws. Two timber wolves stood there, one taller than Shining Armour, the other just a puppy with big mossy feet, but still as big as most of the ponies there. However, both had glowing green eyes, and a full set of thorny claws and sharpened stakes for teeth.</p><p class="double">Applejack scrambled a few steps back, falling on her rump, and she wasn&#039;t the only one. “Big Mac? Is that you in there?”</p><p class="double">“Eyup!” The voice was the stallion&#039;s. He shook his head, which had a thatch of yellow grass. “At least I reckon so.”</p><p class="double">The littler timber wolf spoke in “Oh wow! That was so neat!” She plucked at her head which had a coating of reddish orange leaves, emulating her mane style.</p><p class="double">The two bigger members of the Apple family galloped over to grab her in a three way hug, which resulted in several scratches for Applejack.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I&#039;m sorry, I was going for tree-ponies, but the existing magic fought me.”</p><p class="double">“Of course it would, there are only two of them, silly!” Pinkie Pie interjected.</p><p class="double">“This was the best I could do. Applejack, I am so sorry...“</p><p class="double">The earth-pony looked back at her, but her expression wasn&#039;t angry. “It&#039;s okay Twilight, you couldn&#039;t know this would happen, and you&#039;ve done your best to fix it.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Shining Armour exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Oh, horse-apples.” Twilight turned to her brother and let her disguise drop. “Yes, it&#039;s me.”</p><p class="double">“But what are you doing here?! Do you know how worried every-pony&#039;s been about you? Why were you disguised as somepony else?”</p><p class="double">“Because Codex never failed her princess, either by being less than the perfect student Princess Celestia wanted me to be, or running away rather than facing the music when I eventually fell short of her expectations. Codex isn&#039;t going to be spoken of in the same tone as Sunset Shimmer! Twilight Sparkle is going to have to face Princess Celestia and be formally dismissed as her personal student, and all because I took Spike to that party!</p><p class="double">“Maybe you and the rest of the family were worried about my not making any friends, but Princess Celestia clearly thinks differently. Though if those old legends were about the return of Nightmare Moon, I can see why they were important. Even so, if Princess Celestia had given any indication of their importance, I&#039;d have stayed in my tower and get some-pony else to escort Spike! Though a couple of hours wouldn&#039;t have made much difference, I could have stayed for the whole party and still read all those books before today!”</p><p class="double">“Hold on a second!” Rainbow Dash exclaimed. “That&#039;s why Princess Celestia was going to dismiss you? Because you took a couple of hours off to go to as party?”</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Twilight exclaimed. “Her previous student, Sunset Shimmer had the talent, the ability to be a great mage. But she wasn&#039;t willing to work for it, and bailed on the Princess when she wasn&#039;t allowed access to all the high level magics before mastering the lesser ones. Then she took me on, and I&#039;d been fascinated by magic ever since the Summer Sun Celebration when I was a foal, where I first saw the Princess raised the sun. It was about the biggest honour imaginable, and I swore never to let anything get in the way of studying, never to become another Sunset Shimmer.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d already built good study habits, and I stuck to them, not letting anything distract me, such as a social life, or making friends. I had Spike, and Cadence, and my BBBFF... Big Brother Best Friend Forever. And of course Princess Celestia herself. I didn&#039;t think I needed any other friends, and Princess Celestia agreed. She never suggested I try and make any, at least.</p><p class="double">“Then I went to that party Moondancer was holding, because Spike had a crush on her and I wanted to see him safely there. I only meant to stay for a few minutes, see him settled, but I got talking to ponies and I found out I was wrong. Ponies I&#039;d only ever known as exam scores were suddenly real to me, and finding out about them was fun! I could even help them with their studies, and actually using my knowledge felt wonderful too!</p><p class="double">“Then I got the letter, right in the middle of the party, summoning me to her at once, none of the normal pleasantries she always puts in. She wouldn&#039;t have done that unless she was displeased with me. I realised that she must think I was starting down the path Sunset Shimmer had, and that she probably wasn&#039;t going to take chances.”</p><p class="double">She sighed. “I lost it, I can admit that now, but at the time all I could think of was that I&#039;d failed, and all I wanted to do was hide in a hole somewhere and pull the hole in after me. That&#039;s what Codex was all about, finding out about this library job in Ponyville on the train seemed perfect, but I needed to be some-pony who didn&#039;t have Twilight Sparkle&#039;s baggage. Who was still allowed to make friends. So I hid...”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t believe it!” Blueblood had arrived back inside and had stormed up. “So all the time it was you?! She was probably just summoning you to send you to oversee the Summer Sun Celebrations!”</p><p class="double">“How could I possibly have thought that?!” Twilight shouted back, then stopped herself. “I&#039;m sorry, I know it affected you... but to be honest, <i>you</i> make more sense as Overseer than I do. I&#039;ve never performed any kind of official function before, my strength is research, not socialising with ponies, I am in every possible way one of the least likely ponies in Canterlot to be picked for it. Maybe she did, but that was before I messed up.”</p><p class="double">Astoundingly Blueblood cracked a smirk. “And yet, in a single day, you manage to insinuate yourself into this town, bring together a group of ponies and get them to follow you, even face down a Prince. I&#039;ve heard auntie talk about your organising abilities too.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s just, I mean... I didn&#039;t...” Twilight gave up, and rolled her eyes. “Okay, so you have a point. But look at it from my point of view, I get interrupted and called up on the carpet after abandoning my studies to make some friends, the last thing I&#039;d expect would to be told was to abandon my studies, go to Ponyville to be Royal Overseer for the Summer Sun Celebration, and make some friends. It makes no sense!”</p><p class="double">In loop that was absolutely true. Indeed, that was the whole point of everything she&#039;d done this loop.</p><p class="double">“It all makes sense, if you knew what everything that was going on.” Shining Armour had been listening the whole time, rather than jumping in. He wanted to get Twilight&#039;s side of things. It was clear Princess Celestia had been pretty much on the money, as usual.</p><p class="double">“Those old legends you were supposed to read, they did explain about Nightmare Moon. They also explained how Princess Celestia used some artifacts called the Elements of Harmony to seal her in the moon.” He gave the story the Princess had told him, including the belief that Luna had been turned into Nightmare Moon by some sort of corrupting entity.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash gave forth her two bits worth. “So why didn&#039;t the princess just haul out the Elements again and zap her when she got back?”</p><p class="double">“Because using the Elements like that wrecked them, the books just say they were lost, but before then the two sisters always worked together to wield them, and their bond of friendship was one of the things that made them work. Turning them against Luna meant she could only use them at a fraction of their full power, meaning she was only able to banish her rather than heal her.</p><p class="double">“Even doing that much wrecked them beyond repair, leaving husks, a set of plain rocks. Also, from the way she acted, I think she and Luna were as close as Twily and I. Banishing her must have been like ripping her heart in half. Even if she could, I don&#039;t think she would.”</p><p class="double">Twilight mused. “Presumably there&#039;s some way to restore them to full power, and she believed I could find it, though what I can do that a full powered alicorn princess couldn&#039;t escapes me. Wait... there was a book I found when I was cleaning up the library, &#039;The Elements of Harmony, A Reference Guide”. Some-pony has filed it under &#039;E&#039; in the fiction section. I put it in it&#039;s proper place in the reference section, under &#039;Myths and Legends&#039;.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour chuckled. “I should have guessed you&#039;d figure it out. Apparently, on the day you got your cutie-mark, when you went all super-Starswirl, she sensed that the elements had been reborn and that you had a connection to them. Did you read the book?”</p><p class="double">“No, I just filed it, if I&#039;d started reading the books I&#039;d have never gotten anything done. How&#039;s the spell holding up?”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour looked surprised at the question. “At this size, I can keep it going for hours.”</p><p class="double">“Then we should get over to the library with you keeping the spell over us.”</p><p class="double">&amp;&amp;&amp;</p><p class="double">In practice, they couldn&#039;t get to the library right away as they had to calm down a large heard of frightened ponies. But with the mayor to calm the Ponyvillians and Blueblood to deal with the Canterlot group, they managed to convince every-pony that a solution was being found.</p><p class="double">To reassure them, Twilight ended up having to create a ward matrix for Shining Armour to transfer the original shield spell to, powered by the other two unicorn guards to maintain a shield over the town hall, while the pair duplicated the spell to cover the smaller group. Shining Armour found he couldn&#039;t maintain the shield while moving, and they had to redo it when they reached the library.</p><p class="double">&#039;There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. When when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now the Everfree Forest.&#039;</p><p class="double">That got almost universal shudders from the Ponyville contingent, but Twilight looked confused. “That&#039;s it? I mean if the final confrontation took place there then, yes, that makes sense, but logically, the only pony who could have written this was Princess Celestia herself. How could any of it be a mystery to her? Why hide all the clues so cryptically?”</p><p class="double">“She didn&#039;t want some-pony unworthy to find out all the information, and learn how to use the elements. In the wrong hooves, they could be as big a threat as Nightmare Moon.”</p><p class="double">“But if only I have the connection needed to reawaken them...”</p><p class="double">“She didn&#039;t know that until long after these books were written.”</p><p class="double">“So she was going to send me to Ponyville as it&#039;s the closest town to the Everfree Forest, and hope I&#039;d join the dots. I can see why she wanted some-pony who&#039;d rather be with books than friends... at least till recently.” She looked around at the five ponies who&#039;d followed her. Plus Blueblood, and Applejack&#039;s family, who she refused to leave alone.</p><p class="double">“She admitted she&#039;d made a mistake, several mistakes in how she handled this situation. She was going to summon you, and tell you some of this herself. In fact, she decided to tell me the rest of it, so I could pass it on to you when I found you.”</p><p class="double">“That sounds more sensible, but then why did you pull that stunt in the Town Hall?”</p><p class="double">“I hoped we could contain her, force her to release the Princess or at least keep her from doing any more damage until you had the Elements ready to use.”</p><p class="double">“So what is the other part of what I needed to work out?”</p><p class="double">“The husks in the old Royal palace are only half of the equation. The spirits of the Elements were reborn in the souls of five ponies, who she believed now live in Ponyville. But how you&#039;re going to find them...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, oh! I know, maybe the five of us are the five elements!” Pinkie called out.</p><p class="double">“Sugarcube, that&#039;d be neat and all, but what&#039;re the chances?” Applejack replied. “I mean ain&#039;t none of us ever met her before yesterday. You heard her brother say she had to have some kinda connection from when she got her cutie-mark...”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around. “Did any of you ever come to Canterlot when you were fillies? When I got my cutie-mark, it was the day I was doing my entrance exam for Princess Celestia&#039;s school for Gifted Unicorns. And failing, the magic just wouldn&#039;t come, until I saw a rainbow light in the sky. It unlocked something inside me... Dash, were you flying overhead...? No it looked more like an explosion.”</p><p class="double">“Never flew to Canterlot before today, though when I got my cutie-mark I did a Sonic Rainboom. Could that be the explosion you saw?”</p><p class="double">“Ohmigosh!” Pinkie Pie exclaimed. “I saw a rainbow coloured boom when I was working on my family&#039;s rock farm. It made me feel all happy and light, and I wanted to share that feeling, so I threw my first party and got my cutie-mark!”</p><p class="double">“I discovered my talent for creating fabulous designs when a rainbow shock-wave broke open a geode full of gems.” Rarity interjected.</p><p class="double">“And I was in Manehattan, tryin&#039; to be a fancy pony when I saw a rainbow from the direction of Ponyville. It made me realise where I belonged, right back on Sweet Apple Acres. I guess you were right Pinkie, if Fluttershy can say the same thing.”</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus cringed under the attention, but managed to get out. “Well, I did discover my talent for understanding animals when a rainbow explosion in the sky scared the poor things. Is that what you meant?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned inwardly. If only they&#039;d made this kind of connection the first time round. She gave a date, and they all agreed with it.</p><p class="double">“Then I guess we&#039;ve got the beginnings of a plan. It&#039;s even obvious who&#039;s who. Pinkie Pie, who cheered me up when I was about as low as I could go is the spirit of laughter. Applejack, the pony who wanted to do things the right way rather than cheat, even against an unfair opponent, has to be the spirit of honesty. Rarity, who took in a pony off the street and made her welcome, and used her own gems to make the celebration shine is the spirit of generosity. Rainbow Dash, who leaped in to protect Fluttershy and would have charged Nightmare Moon to protect her friends is the spirit of loyalty. Finally, Fluttershy, who cares for all the animals is the spirit of kindness.”</p><p class="double">“So all you need is the husks and a lightning spell, and you&#039;re set!” Shining Armour said with a relieved expression.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s awfully literal.” Twilight thought out loud. “Maybe it&#039;s a spark of inspiration, of friendship, as they gave me their friendship, inspired me to stop feeling sorry for myself and try and make up for the mess I made... we are still friends, aren&#039;t we?”</p><p class="double">“Yes! Awesomest best friends!” Pinkie bounced around.</p><p class="double">“Then that makes me the sixth element bearer, whatever it is. I guess all we have to do is get to the husks, and that should reunite them with the spirits and create the sixth element.”</p><p class="double">“Uh, what happens to us?” Rainbow asked. “Not that I&#039;m worried or anything...”</p><p class="double">“No, good question.” Twilight replied. “They won&#039;t suck you in or anything like that. Best guess, you&#039;ll get a new piece of jewelry or something similar. You are now the spirits of the elements and the husks will bond to you, not the other way round.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re forgetting that those things are halfway across the Everfree Forest.” Rarity shuddered. “Having to walk all that way through the creepy forest at night, not to mention the muck. Well, if we must, then we must.”</p><p class="double">“I believe I can supply a solution.” Blueblood offered. “My private and exceptionally luxurious air-yacht is moored by the town hall. And my talent is navigation.” He pointed his horn back along his flank at the compass rose cutie-mark.</p><p class="double">“Twily, I think you should have me along too.” Shining Armour said. “If you&#039;re going to be working on the Elements, you won&#039;t be able to protect yourself. I can provide you with shield spells.”</p><p class="double">Big Mac rumbled. “I reckon if Prince Blueblood&#039;s ship can carry us all, I should come along too. I don&#039;t know this magic stuff from a bushel of apples, but I can protect Applejack, and all of you fillies.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, oh! Me too!” Apple Bloom piped up.</p><p class="double">“Uh huh, you young filly are going to plant yourself right here!” Applejack replied.</p><p class="double">“Awww!” The earth-pony turned tree-puppy pouted, which looked really odd on a timber wolf face.</p><p class="double">Twilight hadn&#039;t expected the offers of help, but she wasn&#039;t going to turn them down. All she really wanted to do was get the quest over with as quickly as possible. From what her brother had said, her plan had succeeded perfectly, which didn&#039;t explain why she felt so rotten about it. When this was all over, she was going to have a long talk with the Princess.</p><p class="double">She still considered the way the princess had handled things wrong, but that didn&#039;t mean that Twilight&#039;s response was right. Maybe if she&#039;d just discussed her concerns, that might have been an alternative solution. But she was set in this course, and if she couldn&#039;t go back and do things differently (at least until next loop) she could make sure this adventure would have a happy ending.</p><p class="double">“Okay, then!” She said, looking around the expanded fellowship of the elements. “Let&#039;s go!”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"><u>Omake (with polish from Capt Crysallid)</u></p><p class="double">“You have my air-ship!” declaimed Prince Blueblood.</p><p class="double">“And my horn!” Shining Armour added.</p><p class="double">“And my claws!” Big Mac finished. “What? You were expecting an axe?”</p><p class="double"></p><p><u>Omake 2 (by Capt Crysallid)</u></p><p class="double">“One does not simply <i>trot</i> into Everfree,” Blueblood tried to explain, only to be shot by arrows out of nowhere. “Good lord! This isn’t even Act Three yet and already with the arrows?!” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">22.6</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Rarity said, nodding firmly to herself. “Here we go.”</p><p class="double">She trotted forward, broke into a run, ascended on the move, spread her wings… and leapt.</p><p class="double">There was a moment of fear, as she felt herself free-falling, but she’d already begun the first wingbeat and felt the new-yet-familiar appendages push her bodily skywards.</p><p class="double">Again. Again. And then some invisible connection was made in her mind, because the next wingbeat used a healthy dose of weather magic and sent her <i>soaring.</i> The feeling was so incredible that she repeated it three more times in a row, before settling into more of a glide.</p><p class="double">Looking down, Rarity felt another momentary stab of terror, as she realized just how high she was. But a familiar pair of leathery wings below her banished the fear in a rush of warmth, and of love.</p><p class="double">Spike gradually climbed to her height, coasting on a thermal. “Not so bad after all, is it?”</p><p class="double">“Not when you’re here,” she replied. “Just knowing you <i>could</i> catch me, it… puts my mind at rest.”</p><p class="double">He gave her a quick smile. “Shall we head over there? I packed lunch.”</p><p class="double">Following his pointing finger, Rarity saw a clearing a few miles off with a rock formation in the middle. “Yes, that looks nice.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Her landing wasn’t precisely perfect, but nor was it the crash she half-dreaded. It just felt easier to let her wings and her new weather magic do the work, and so she wasn’t moving fast enough to do anything more than stumble.</p><p class="double">Spike made a far more dramatic four-point landing, dropping straight down the last few metres to end in a crouch balanced by tail and one hand.</p><p class="double">“Show off,” Rarity twitted him, not concealing her relief at being on solid ground again.</p><p class="double">And yet, as they ate lunch (mica sandwiches for Spike and chestnuts for her), Rarity found herself tempted constantly to rush the meal.</p><p class="double">Once she was done, Spike gave her a knowing grin as she impatiently waited for him to finish.</p><p class="double">“Anxious to get back up there?” he asked.</p><p class="double">“I… yes, actually,” Rarity admitted.</p><p class="double">“Once you have tasted flight, you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards; for there you have been, and there you will long to return.”</p><p class="double">“That’s nice. Who’s it from?”</p><p class="double">“What, you don’t think I came up with it?” Spike raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">“No.” Rarity replied flatly, hoof to her mouth to hold in a snigger.</p><p class="double">“Some human called Leonardo. He invented flying machines in their world… or something? I can’t remember the details. What I do remember is that he never flew in his life.” Spike polished off the sandwich. “He was spot on, though.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, he was.” Rarity rolled the words around her head. She was still scared of flying, but somehow the fear had… changed. It wasn’t the fear of death any more.</p><p class="double">It was the kind of fear you got when going on a roller coaster. The kind of fear that shivered down your spine when you were reading a scary book.</p><p class="double">The kind of fear that only made the enjoyment sharper.</p><p class="double">“Catch me if you can!” she said suddenly, and leapt skywards. Spike’s shout of surprise followed by laughter chased her up, and then she heard one of his own slamming launch wingbeats.</p><p class="double">Just maybe, Dash had the right personality for flying, as well as the talent. Grasp the moment with all four hooves, and hang the consequences.</p><p class="double">Rarity turned aside, dodging a rapidly ascending Spike. Now, how to keep away from a large and determined dragon… at least until she could get him to take a dunk in the lake…</p><p class="double">Best to wash down your lunch, after all.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">22.7</p><p class="double">“Spike!” Twilight said, turning.</p><p class="double">“Yeah?” The dragon barely looked up from his book. “What is – whoa!”</p><p class="double">His threat sense abruptly jangled, and an outflung hand stopped the flying ball an inch from hitting him on the forehead. “What gives, Twi?”</p><p class="double">“More evidence for one of my theses!” Twilight answered, grinning. “Excellent data point, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“What did I even do?” Spike picked the ball out of the air.</p><p class="double">“Easy. Your reflex action was to use the Force.” Twilight bounced another ball on the ground.</p><p class="double">“So?”</p><p class="double">“As far as I have been able to prove, the first few loops – and especially the first few <i>fused</i> loops – of a recently awakened Looper could be called ‘formative’.” She lobbed the ball out of the window, and Scootaloo pinged it back with blurring speed. “Basically, one of your first loops was the Jedi loop, and so it’s one of the ones which had an unusual impact on you.”</p><p class="double">“Okay…” Spike nodded slowly. “Well, there are worse loops to have that happen with.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, true.” Twilight paused, imagining what Spike would be like without the moderating influence of a life trained as Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p><p class="double">Though it <i>had</i> still taken him decades to properly get the impulse control side of it down pat.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">22.8</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around, then concentrated. There was something on the edge of perception…</p><p class="double">With an almost audible <i>click</i>, words and images appeared. A list, and:</p><p class="double"><u>Select class.</u></p><p class="double">“What?” She looked along the list. Some of them were greyed out, others lit up. “Er… I guess… wizard?”</p><p class="double"><u>Wizard selected.</u></p><p class="double">Statistics flowed past, too fast to properly perceive, then she was standing in an inn and wearing a pointy hat and long robes tailored for the unicorn she still was. A further check revealed she had a book of spells, an owl for a familiar, and a couple of dozen gold pieces.</p><p class="double">The doorbell jangled, and Twilight felt a smile steal over her as Pinkie Pie bounced into the inn with a balalaika slung over her back.</p><p class="double">“Ooh, hi Twilight!” Pinkie said, grinning back. “What are you this time?”</p><p class="double">“Er… a Wizard, I suppose.”</p><p class="double">“I’m a Bard!” Pinkie demonstrated by playing some chords on the instrument… somehow. “I don’t just play music – here, it’s<i> magical</i> music!”</p><p class="double">“That sounds useful.” Twilight frowned, struck by a thought. “Any idea what’s going on?”</p><p class="double">“We~ll, I think we All Meet In An Inn!” Pinkie spun back towards the door as it opened again. “Wonder who this is!”</p><p class="double">It turned out to be Fluttershy, with a bunny rabbit sitting on her head; presumably Angel. Part of Twilight’s loop memories told her that the cream-coloured pegasus was a ‘Druid’.</p><p class="double">“All of us?” Twilight asked, as she waved Fluttershy over. “Hi, ‘shy. Nice to see you.”</p><p class="double">“T…thank you,” Fluttershy replied. “Are the others here?”</p><p class="double">“Don’t know yet, but I suspect so.” Twilight looked Fluttershy over closely. “Are you a spellcaster as well this time?”</p><p class="double">“Druids use plant magic!” Pinkie answered for her. “And animal magic. So, kinda what Fluttershy does anyway! I wonder what Applejack’s going to be?”</p><p class="double">As it happened, despite the obvious cue, it was Dash through the door next. She had a slim knotted rope around her forehead and was wearing a simple <i>gi.</i></p><p class="double">“Monk? Really?” Pinkie said, then shrugged. “Guess they <i>are</i> the fastest.”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Dash reared back and did a few demonstration moves. “Nothing better for the fastest pegasus in Equestria!”</p><p class="double">“But we’re not <i>in</i> Equestria,” Twilight pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Same difference.” Dash landed back on her hooves. “So, what’s going on?”</p><p class="double">The door slammed open again, and Rarity swanned in followed by a very ill-tempered cat.</p><p class="double">“Sorcerer,” Pinkie noted. “Ooh, she’s got a familiar as well!”</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny locked eyes with Opalescent and made quite clear what the price of provoking him would be. He was quite eloquent with his hand gestures.</p><p class="double">“This world seems wonderful,” Rarity said, lights dancing around her. “I’ve already learned three new spells, and I can just feel more waiting to be learned!”</p><p class="double">“That’s how your class works, yep,” Pinkie nodded.</p><p class="double">“How do you know all this?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Bardic Knowledge!” she answered, with a huge grin. “In practice, it just means I have this with me!”</p><p class="double">The pink pony rummaged in her mane and pulled out a large, thick, hardbacked book. It made a <i>slam</i> when it landed on the table.</p><p class="double">Twilight picked it up. “Player’s Handbook?”</p><p class="double">“It’s a great read!”</p><p class="double">The door swung open one final time, and Applejack joined them.</p><p class="double">“Ooh…” Pinkie looked her over. “Barbarian? Interesting choice.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t you be makin’ any jokes about book learnin’,” Applejack warned Pinkie, “or we see how angry ah can get.”</p><p class="double">“Right!” The pink pony brushed off the threat. “Now we’ve All Met In An Inn, we need an Adventure Hook.”</p><p class="double">What looked like a human – but with pointy ears – handed Pinkie an envelope.</p><p class="double">“Thanks, NPC! Oh, guys, this is Nathan Percy Chapham. I talked to him before the rest of you turned up – he knows everything that’s going on around here. He’s an elf!”</p><p class="double">Twilight could feel a headache coming on. “There’s this whole set of rules here that I’m not getting, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Pinkie gave her a kind smile. “But just read that book, you’ll start to understand. Come on, everypony, apparently there’s treasure and stuff at the Keep on the Borderlands!”</p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>23.1</p><p class="double">“Do you know,” Temeraire said, craning his neck to look at Lawrence, “I do wonder whether we might not interfere with Trafalgar this time.”</p><p class="double">“Might be an idea, yes.” The British Dragoncorps Captain rubbed his chin. “Perhaps, if Admiral Nelson is or feels indebted to us, then he might be more inclined to consider your proposals earlier. And, of course,” Lawrence gave a warm smile to his partner, “since he is a kind man, though at times a man who does not suffer fools, it might be that he would consider granting you commission.”</p><p class="double">“I do enjoy receiving a commission…” Temeraire mused. “Though not at the cost of an invasion of Britain. Have you had any thoughts on my cousin, might I enquire?”</p><p class="double">Lawrence winced. Trying to work out how to head off the situation with Lien was never easy – ensuring that her own partner survived was proving harder still than enfranchising dragons, and they could never be remotely sure of either in any given loop.</p><p class="double">Then he looked up. “I say, that’s unusual.”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Temeraire raised his own head, and closed his eyes. “Yes, I can feel it as well. A kind of faint, singing magic.”</p><p class="double">“It reminds me of when we had Fallarnon and Mnementh to visit,” Lawrence said. “I wonder who it is?”</p><p class="double">“I hope it is Hiccup and Toothless.” Temeraire blinked down at Lawrence. “It does not feel precisely like Fallarnon and Mnementh, though perhaps it is instead Twoflower and Ninereeds – we have not seen them in a while.”</p><p class="double">“Then come along, dear heart,” Lawrence said, making the harness ready for a solo flight. “I am sure they will not begrudge us a day or two to find out.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">The young Celestial circled over Dover. “It is certainly from here,” he commented to Lawrence, “though I am at a loss to determine who is not here or who is excess. Can you see anything?”</p><p class="double">Lawrence unshipped his telescope. “If you would hover for a moment, dear one, I might be able to check more closely.”</p><p class="double">“Of course.” Temeraire backwinged, and moved his neck as best he could to cancel out the movement of his body.</p><p class="double">“I say,” Lawrence exclaimed, as the telescope revealed something he could not quite divine from on high. “That’s not Lily, in her spot. It looks to be… well, whatever he or she is, that is a purple dragon. I think we should examine this more closely.”</p><p><hr></p><p>A slim young woman of about twenty-two nodded to Lawrence as he approached the strange dragon. “Good day – oh, Captain, I see. Well, good day to you, Captain.”</p><p class="double">Lawrence noticed the matching insignia on her shoulders. “And to you, Captain…?”</p><p class="double">“Rarity Harcourt,” she replied promptly.</p><p class="double">Temeraire could not quite restrain a gasp. “So you are the-”</p><p class="double">He pulled himself up at Lawrence’s slight gesture.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I’m a Looper,” Rarity replied quietly. She paused. “I assume I’m replacing someone you know?”</p><p class="double">“My lover,” Lawrence answered.</p><p class="double">“Well, no fear of my trying to take her place on that score.” Rarity directed a fond look at the dragon lying in Lily’s normal spot. “I’m spoken for, though I expect we’ll have to avoid making that too clear this loop.”</p><p class="double">“What is his name?” Temeraire asked. “I would ask him, but it seems as though he is asleep.”</p><p class="double">“I was,” the purple replied. “No harm done. I’m Spykoranuvellitar – you might be interested to know that this time around, at least, Britain has a flame-using dragon.”</p><p class="double">“Well, one before Iskierka, that is,” Temeraire pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Oh, you do normally get another?” Rarity asked. “We’re not exactly familiar with this loop – I’ve been running off loop memories since I Awoke here.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Lawrence thought for a moment, then sat down. “Come on, dear one, it seems we must help a pair of hatchlings through the whirlpool of the Napoleonic Wars.”</p><p class="double">“Watch it!” Spykoran rumbled, chuckling. “I’m bigger than you two put together.”</p><p class="double">“For now,” Temeraire said quickly, and stuck his tongue out.</p><p class="double">“Dear one, I would appreciate it if you would not act like a day-old whelp…” Lawrence said, smiling broadly and shaking his head.</p><p><hr></p><p>23.2 (22.8 continued)</p><p class="double">“Ah need some healin’ over here,” Applejack said lightly, lashing out with Rarity-modified Ember Celica and knocking a Lizardman for six.</p><p class="double">“I got it! I got it!” Pinkie slid over to behind the Barbarian. “Cure light wounds!”</p><p class="double">Applejack waited. “That’s it? Ain’t much healin’…”</p><p class="double">“Well, you could have tried being a Paladin or a Cleric.” Pinkie finished the instrumental part and began singing again. <i>“A land unknown we come so far, we ride the night ‘till morning star…”</i></p><p class="double">“Catchy,” Dash commented, grinning as she bounced past AJ towards the main press of the enemy. “Ha, missed me!”</p><p class="double">Twilight muttered under her breath. “And…Web!”</p><p class="double">“Whoah!” Dash twisted herself in an improbable way, and managed to avoid being stuck. “Watch where you’re aiming!”</p><p class="double">“With your Dex score and Evasion, you were in no danger!” Pinkie said knowledgeably in a brief gap in vocals.</p><p class="double">“I guess I <i>am</i> good at dodging,” Dash admitted grudgingly, knocking two trapped Lizardman heads together with a swift kick.</p><p class="double">Rarity salvoed off Magic Missiles, then tried a Glitterdust. “Take that! And that! Oh, you beasts, stop swarming Fluttershy!”</p><p class="double">“…eep?” Fluttershy managed. “Um… tree shape?”</p><p class="double">The lizardmen blinked.</p><p class="double">“Where’d she go?” one of them asked, and then got kicked in the kneecap by Angel Bunny.</p><p class="double">“That’s kind of neat,” Twilight muttered, watching as he took half the Lizardmen to pieces by himself. “Because he’s so small, all that enhancement magic he gets from Fluttershy is compressed. And since it’s Angel anyway…”</p><p class="double">“That makes sense, ah think…” Appejack said, nursing a bruise. “Ooh, that’s gonna be tender… Them clubs they got have metal cores, y’know.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced sympathetically. “Ouch…”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” AJ shrugged. “Ain’t no real harm done, though.”</p><p class="double">Then she fell over.</p><p class="double">Pinkie trotted over in turn and slapped another Cure spell on. “Barbarians get like this when their Rage runs out.”</p><p class="double">There was a sudden high-pitched <i>oof</i> of pain, as one of the few remaining Lizardmen finally caught Angel with a club. The rabbit crashed off a wall and bounced to the floor, before rolling upright.</p><p class="double">“You <i>horrible</i> people!”</p><p class="double">“Speaking of rage…” Twilight gulped, as the tree turned back into Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">And then into a leopard.</p><p class="double">“Ooh!” Pinkie grinned with a <i>squeak</i> noise. “Ding, hello, level five!”</p><p class="double">“Should we… help?” Dash asked, pointing over to the few Lizardmen not unconscious on the floor. “I mean, I kinda feel sorry for them…”</p><p class="double">“Well, they did give poor Appejack quite the beating before the rest of us got properly stuck in…” Rarity mused. “I say we give it a minute.”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough,” Twilight said, then lifted Angel off the floor. “Bad bunny, no putting the boot in.”</p><p class="double">Angel made a rude gesture involving a carrot.</p><p class="double">“I don’t wanna buck any more trees, grandma…” Applejack murmured, before pushing herself back upright. “Okay, who’s got the health potions? Four fights in a row is one too many for my taste. Especially ‘cuz I only <i>got</i> two rages, and ah just used th’ last one.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, you make a good point.” Twilight examined her spell book. “Ooh, I like the sound of <i>Haste.</i>”</p><p class="double">“You’ll like even more that we got the three-point-oh version houseruled in!” Pinkie said. The others examined that statement for a bit, then discarded it for their own peace of mind.</p><p class="double">“Er, Fluttershy, dear?” Rarity ventured. “I think you can stop now.”</p><p class="double">The leopard looked down, winced, and turned back into a pegasus. “Sorry… I just… saw red?”</p><p class="double">“Don’t we all…” Applejack shrugged. “No harm done, they’re all just knocked out. Now, would y’ mind givin’ me a bit of that first aid o’ yours?”</p><p class="double">“Not at all.” Fluttershy trotted over, a heal spell building on her wings.</p><p><hr></p><p>23.3</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded along as the local Anchor explained his Loop.</p><p class="double">It took quite some time.</p><p class="double">“…and then it turns out that, actually, the real <i>real</i> bad guy isn’t even Aizen at all! He was some kind of sick red herring, and so were the Xcution people – have I mentioned them yet?”</p><p class="double">“No, actually,” Twilight replied politely. “But I’ve run out of notepaper. Can you give me a minute to get another pad?”</p><p class="double">Ichigo sighed and nodded. “Go ahead. I swear, my universe is a right mind screw.”</p><p class="double">“I’m sure you’d be welcome in Equestria if you ever end up there,” Twilight offered.</p><p class="double">“Eh, no thanks.” Ichigo stretched. “I’ve heard about the place from Naruto, and, well, no offense, but it sounds kind of boring.”</p><p class="double">“I understand,” Twilight said, after a moment. “I heard your loop is potentially the longest, so I can understand if you get bored easily.”</p><p class="double">“Tell me about it! I’ve taken to invading Hell for something to do!”</p><p class="double">Twilight didn’t say anything, remembering a certain drilling expedition.</p><p class="double">“Anyway, Xcution. Yeah, watch out for the guy in charge of them – he can make you think he’s your friend. Literally – he hits you with his sword, and it’s like history is rewritten so he’s your best friend.”</p><p class="double">Twilight surprised him by giggling. “Yeah, if he hit me with that I think he might just end up turning into a pony from backlash.”</p><p class="double">Her host roared with laughter.</p><p class="double">“…okay, as soon as we’re done with Aizen, we’re testing that!” Ichigo shouted, grinning wildly. “I <i>so</i> want to see that jerk look ridiculous!”</p><p class="double">“Glad to help – though it might only work if I’m in my base form.” She gestured down at her body – currently human, though tests had shown it was a human false body and a unicorn spirit.</p><p class="double">Ichigo was still chuckling. “Right, yeah. Anyway, once Xcution are handled, the next lot is this kinda militant Quincy lot. Best way to handle them is to…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Tsukishima darted around a hurried block from Twilight’s <i>Fuhentekina nazo</i>, and slipped the point of his blade into her shoulder. He wasn’t aiming to hurt her – just a nick would serve his purposes.</p><p class="double">Then there was a bright flash just as he reached her, and his sword clattered to the ground next to him.</p><p class="double">“Are you okay, Tsuki?” he heard Twilight ask. “You dropped your sword!”</p><p class="double">“Thanks,” he said, reaching for it and nearly falling over as his body didn’t react the way he expected it to.</p><p class="double">“Oh, no!” Twilight said, pointing. Tsukishima abruptly noticed that she was now, for whatever reason, a unicorn. “Ichigo’s coming! Quick, Tsuki, the only way to stop a Looper that powerful is the Elements of Magic!”</p><p class="double"><i>The what?</i> <i>A what? She’s a what? What the hell-</i></p><p class="double">Then he noticed he was a horse.</p><p class="double">Then he realized he had no way to carry Book of the End, and hence no way to properly control the mess that was taking place.</p><p class="double">And that was when a stray false-memory from his Bookmarking of Twilight told him what the Elements of Harmony were. And that he would somehow have to be a personification of laughter, honesty, loyalty, generosity and kindness all at once.</p><p class="double">“Oh, this isn’t my day…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight blinked as the Loop reset blanked out Book of the End’s effects. “Wow, that was one strange loop end. I didn’t know the Elements <i>had</i> a backwards firing mode…”</p><p class="double">It made a lot of sense, though. If they purified whatever villain had managed to get hold of them and tried to use them, that would put paid to the problem as easily as just firing them <i>at</i> the villain.</p><p class="double">Redeemed-Tsukishima was weird, though. He’d started a career working for an internet social media company, at least once Ichigo had stopped laughing himself sick long enough to get them a laptop.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>23.4</p><p class="double">‘“There’s something I have to tell you, Twilight,” Rainbow Dash said, blushing. “I… it’s kinda been brewing for a while…”</p><p class="double">“No need,” Twilight replied, stretching out a wing. “I think I can guess.”</p><p class="double">“But-”</p><p class="double">“No, Dash,” Twilight added, a slight smirk playing over her features. “You are <i>not</i> good at concealing it.”</p><p class="double">“…okay.” Dash still looked reluctant, so Twilight stepped closer and kissed her gently-‘</p><p><hr></p><p>“I do <i>what?</i>”</p><p class="double">Princess Cadence jumped, scattering plastic models all over the place.</p><p class="double">“Cadence…” Twilight said slowly, “I am going to go out of the room now. When I come back in again in a second, we won’t talk about what you’re doing with those models I got from the hub loop.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">23.5</p><p class="double">“That’s right, foolish peasants!” The eerie, almost insectile alicorn cackled as citizens of Ponyville fled before her. “Nightmare Rarity has arrived, and nothing can save you now!”</p><p class="double">“Not if I have anything to say about it!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Rarity looked up, nostrils flaring. “I should have known that <i>you</i> would be here… Spykoran.”</p><p class="double">“Your evil reign ends now!” Spykoran transferred his lance from carry to strike position, holding it in both left arm and left leg. His wings beat, slowly at first, then sent him screaming down towards Nightmare Rarity.</p><p class="double">At the last moment, she dodged aside and the lance bit into soft earth. “Fool!”</p><p class="double">The dragon spun around on his spear, lashing out with tail and claws, and only just missed hitting his opponent.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Rarity’s wings slashed forward, crackling with magic, and only some quick work with an arming-sword stopped her blows connecting on Spykoran in turn.</p><p class="double">As Spykoran unlimbered a shield and stepped forward, she backed – still with an arrogantly superior grin. “Foolish dragon. None can stand against the might of a Nightmare.”</p><p class="double">“If I didn’t try, then I’d have nothing to be proud of,” he rejoined, and lunged. The arming-sword skipped off a quickly conjured gemstone kukri, which was joined by a second and a scimitar as the Nightmare continued to back.</p><p class="double">The musical clash of steel on sapphire filled the square as dragon and alicorn fought back and forth. Spykoran used his shield to fend off blows from gem-blades, trying to stop the trio of them from having a chance to attack simultaneously, and occasionally sent one flying into the middle distance with his sword. When that happened, he tried to use the opening to strike at his foe – but, canny as she was, Nightmare Rarity kept her distance as best she was able and most such attempts to press the attack had to be abandoned as the deflected sword returned.</p><p class="double">But the stalemate couldn’t last forever, and all at once the pace of the battle changed. Nightmare-Rarity brought all three blades in for the concerted assault Spykoran had been so assiduously avoiding – and he swept the arming sword around in an arc, smashing one to pieces and knocking the other two to sink deep into the ground.</p><p class="double">The Nightmare growled, conjuring bows and gem-tipped arrows out of the aether. Firing three at once, she unleashed an arrow-storm.</p><p class="double">Spykoran raised his shield, but that wasn’t really necessary, as his sword hand moved in a series of swooping curls that just <i>happened</i> to intercept every arrow and knock them off course.</p><p class="double">Nightmarity didn’t relent in her barrage, instead dividing focus to lift one of her blades from the ground it had become lodged in and send it spinning at his back-</p><p class="double">And he caught it. Three quick steps, and the sizzling gem-scimitar was held threatening her neck. The arming-sword was at her side.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Rarity’s eyes narrowed…</p><p class="double">And then she took a forward step of her own, and caught the dragon with a fierce kiss.</p><p class="double">“Harmony’s six <i>sides</i>,” she gasped, coming up for air, “but you are <i>dashing</i>!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, what?” several of the watching ponies said, startled enough to speak.</p><p class="double">Rarity and Spike ignored them, vanishing in a teleport.</p><p><hr></p><p>A minute or so later, Twilight’s voice raised above the confused hubbub. “It’s okay, everypony! I checked – Rarity isn’t evil, they were just... practicing for a play, I think Spike said, and things got a bit out of hand.”</p><p class="double">After another few seconds of talk, the general reduction in noise level seemed to indicate that this was acceptable. </p><p class="double">“They totally weren’t,” Dash noted quietly, as Twilight walked back out of the crowd.</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah,” Twilight allowed. “But do <i>you</i> want to try explaining exactly what we just saw?”</p><p class="double">“…yeah, good point,” Dash said. “Mind having a word with them to make sure their acting quality is a bit… well… less showcased? I think I saw a Wonderbolt patrol head off towards Canterlot.”</p><p class="double">Right on cue, the Princesses appeared in a flash of light and shadow.</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Celestia said without preamble. “What happened? Which of your friends got corrupted? We need to find some way to use the Elements without them, or-”</p><p class="double">Luna had been looking around. “The town seems very intact. Didst though remember the right address?”</p><p class="double">“What – of course I did, Luna!” Celestia said, stung. “This is Ponyville, where my most trusted student lives, of course I remember where it is!”</p><p class="double">Twilight waited a moment as the two Royal Sisters began bickering, then shrugged and walked off. With a bit of luck, the whole issue would just quietly go away.</p><p class="double">She would need to have that word with Rarity and Spike about cover stories, though…</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">23.6</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight looked this Loop’s body over. “I would appear to be male.”</p><p class="double">Aside from that, though, Twilight – or, as her memories started to come in, ‘Dusk Shine’ – was his/her normal self. And based on more of those memories, everyone else was the same as they were in a normal Loop.</p><p class="double">That is, the same gender. Twilight/Dusk got a brief headache trying to keep pronouns straight, then decided to just hang continuity of self reference and call himself male for the duration.</p><p class="double">There was a knock at the door.</p><p class="double">“Coming!” Dusk said, still alert for any discrepancies. He’d been looping far too long to assume there was <i>only</i> one change in a given world – that kind of assumption got you blindsided by Old Mare Henderson.</p><p class="double">Upon opening the door, it turned out to be the Element of Laughter.</p><p class="double">“Hi, Pinkie-”</p><p class="double">Dusk’s contingent shield triggered, pinging half of a crowbar off the doorframe as a swing at her legs was abruptly halted by the spell.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what the…?” Dusk mused, as Pinkie stared at the truncated implement. “Pinkie, why the hay did you just take a swing at my…” Dusk’s mind did a minor backflip as he realized just where Pinkie had to have been aiming, and then the whole ‘male’ thing shocked him all over again, “…aherm.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, no fair!” Pinkie looked Dusk up and down. “You’re off script!”</p><p class="double">“Script?” Dusk repeated, dumbly. Pinkie was usually strange, but <i>this…</i></p><p class="double">True to form, the pink pony pulled a set of close-typed pages out of her mane. “See? Right here.”</p><p class="double">Dusk skimmed the page. “Er… hang on a second.” He flipped back, then cast a spell to absorb the whole content of the sheaf of paper in one go.</p><p class="double">“…this would appear to be a script for Love Hina, with different character names and the addition of a crowbar.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah?” Pinkie asked. “So? That sounds about right.”</p><p class="double">“I hate worlds like this…” Dusk sighed deeply. “Okay, buck this. Get Spike to send me a letter if there’s an actual serious threat, otherwise I’m going to be sunbathing without the interference of atmosphere.”</p><p class="double">“You can’t do that!” Pinkie protested. “We don’t have the beach episode for another three weeks! Besides, how are we going to do the eventual character development where I learn that hitting random stallions in the nuts is wrong?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn shrugged. “Why not do the final episode, skip everything else, and then just drop the whole subject?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie seemed to be thinking it over, her face screwed up in an internal battle.</p><p class="double">Dusk’s horn lit. “Get Spike to let me know what you think of the idea.”</p><p class="double">A bright flash, and he was gone.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Art thou not Dusk Shine?” Luna asked, frowning at the unicorn sprawled out on top of her lunar sand-castle.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” the Anchor replied. “I love air bubble spells, by the way. Really useful. Oh, out of curiosity, do you find me physically attractive in any way, shape or form?”</p><p class="double">“Nay!” Luna said, shivering. “Thine age, physical if not mental, is far too young for my comfort.”</p><p class="double">“Cool.” Dusk put his sunglasses back on. “Sorry for taking over the castle, it probably took you quite a lot of work.”</p><p class="double">“’tis no problem,” Luna assured him. “I was thinking on adding a new wing in any case. It is a soothing past-time.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“The Great and Powerful Trixie questions this script,” Trixie said, having finished reading it. “Why is she required to be hit so much?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “I dunno, but it’s in there. Hey, you’ll just be wearing an illusion, right? No actual vulnerables to hit.”</p><p class="double">“Let Trixie maintain a permanent shield spell and get top billing, and you have a deal.”</p><p class="double">They shook on it.</p><p><hr></p><p>23.7</p><p class="double">“Well, this is interesting!” Cadence said. “Kind of the reverse of normal – or, well, the reverse of the first time, anyway.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, seeing her point.</p><p class="double">It was another one of those loops where she and another pony were the Royal Sisters, meaning that they had to defeat Discord and subsequently run Equestria.</p><p class="double">“Although you’re older than me,” Cadence added. “Not fair!”</p><p class="double">“I’m not <i>much</i> older.” Twilight looked herself over. “And what does that matter, anyway?”</p><p class="double">“You’d get it if you grew up with a sibling closer in age to you.”</p><p class="double">“And… you do?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, no.” Cadence shrugged. “So my whole point doesn’t actually go anywhere.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, sighing.</p><p class="double">“Okay!” Cadence clapped her hooves. “How are we dividing this up?”</p><p class="double">The purple alicorn thought for a moment. “What about… arts, sciences and humanities?”</p><p class="double">“Go on…” Cadence said.</p><p class="double">“I handle the science stuff – you know, physics and weather and so on; you do the arts and culture side, and for things that are a mixture we share.” Twilight waved a hoof. “Best I can come up with.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, that seems sensible.”</p><p class="double">“Just… a warning,” Twilight added. “Every pony who’s been with me on one of these has overdone something. I don’t want to see you getting out that Dating Simulator thing again.”</p><p class="double">“Never crossed my mind,” Cadence mumbled, not looking Twilight in the eye.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Twilight let it go. “Alright, then.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Alright, fair enough,” Twilight admitted, watching Chrysalis and Sombra go down the aisle. “That does solve two problems at a stroke.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Cadence replied, beaming. “I do love a good wedding… even when it isn’t mine.”</p><p class="double">“Are you <i>sure</i> you’re coping alright?” Twilight asked anxiously.</p><p class="double">“Positive.”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned away, and missed a slight eye twitch.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Cadence…” Twilight asked slowly, “Why do you have calendars all over one wall of your room?”</p><p class="double">Cadence blushed slightly. “Well, I noticed last year that your parents still got together. And, well…” The blush deepened.</p><p class="double">“Right, gotcha,” Twilight nodded, spotting her brother’s eventual birth date on the calendar up at the far left – and, down at the far right, his date of maturity. “Kind of creepy, but if it’s how you’re coping then I suppose it’s not <i>too</i> bad.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Sorry?” Shining said, blinking. “Could you repeat that?”</p><p class="double">Cadence asked him out. Again.</p><p class="double">“Er…” his eyes took on a distinctly hunted look. “I’m flattered, really I am, but… I can’t help thinking of you as the thousand-plus-year-old Princess of the Arts.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn’s eye twitched. “I see. Thank you for your time.”</p><p class="double">She vanished in a teleport.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Cadence!” Twilight said sharply, shading her eyes against the glow of magic. “I said <i>not</i> to break out the Dating Simulator!”</p><p class="double">“I know you did,” Cadence replied casually, “but it’s the only way to make sure I marry Shining Armor!”</p><p class="double">“Calm down!” Twilight tried to get some handle on the current status of the spell engine as she spoke. “This won’t solve anything!”</p><p class="double">“I beg to differ.” Cadence shrugged. “Besides… it’s kind of too late to turn it off.”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “Oh, <i>brilliant</i>.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“So, anyway,” Cadence concluded, “after that, the Dating Simulator went off. Only problem was that I… sort of forgot the restrictor.”</p><p class="double">“Which does what?” Shining asked, with a kind of horrified fascination.</p><p class="double">“That’s the bit which trims romantic possibilities back to one per pony.” Cadence tapped a forehoof on the floor. “Every individual combination would have made the ponies happy, just…”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I can imagine.” Shining nodded. “How bad was it?”</p><p class="double">“I believe Big Macintosh was assigned about fifty potentials, and then the valves started to explode.” She gave an awkward smile. “Still… not too much harm done. And the moon <i>did</i> look good with me on it.”</p><p class="double">Shining shook his head. “Right, at least we all learned an important lesson.”</p><p class="double">“Which is?” Cadence asked, frowning. “I mean, there’s several I can see. Like to use transistors and surge protectors.”</p><p class="double">“Well, the main one is to not under any circumstances let you go without either me or a hefty supply of romance novels.” Shining nuzzled his wife. “You’re just <i>too</i> romantic. And while that would normally just sound like something which wasn’t really a problem at all, it is when you try to enforce it.”</p><p class="double">“Got it.” Cadence looked down. “Sorry.”</p><p class="double">“It wouldn’t have been as much of a problem if you’d managed to hold out another few years, I suspect,” Shining added, “since the Elements would have formed by then. And you <i>did</i> hold out longer than any pony else so far.”</p><p class="double">“Going to try to break my record?”</p><p class="double">“I was considering it…” Shining winked, and Cadence thwapped him in the flank with a wing. “And I hope you dismantled the Dating Simulator.”</p><p class="double">Cadence gave him a puppy-eye look. “Do I have to?”</p><p class="double">He just looked at her.</p><p class="double">“Fine.”</p><p><hr></p><p>23.8</p><p class="double">“Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!” A pegasus stallion with a sunglasses-wearing flame for a cutie mark drummed his hooves on the floor. “Come on, people, where’s the action?”</p><p class="double">“Er, Kamina?” A similar-looking unicorn with a drill for a mark said. “We only just got here, and… it might be kind of impolite.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, I gotcha.” Kamina shook his head. “Still, there better be something soon. Besides, Simon, have you <i>ever</i> had a quiet loop?”</p><p class="double">“Now you mention it…” the second pony grinned. “No, not at all.”</p><p class="double">“And at least you’re not taller than me this time…” Kamina mused.</p><p class="double">“I am.” Simon pointed. “Look. This horn thing puts me about half an inch taller than you are.”</p><p class="double">“Doesn’t count.” Kamina shook his head.</p><p class="double">“How can it not count? It has a spiral pattern!”</p><p class="double">“In that case,” Kamina spread his wings. “Gotcha now!”</p><p class="double">Simon grinned again, and held up a hoof. “You always win.”</p><p class="double">“You know it, bro!”</p><p class="double">There was a skidding sound.</p><p class="double">“Hi, new ponies!” Pinkie Pie said, beaming, as she halted in front of them. “What Loop are you from?”</p><p class="double">“Only the most awesome loop in the history of time!” Kamina and Simon shouted together, having rehearsed.</p><p class="double">A blue blur resolved itself into Rainbow Dash. “Did I hear somepony mention the word awesome?”</p><p class="double">“Sure did!” Kamina looked her over. “I like the cut of your jib, fellow flying horse thing.”</p><p class="double">“Pegasus,” Dash answered easily. “What’s a jib?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I’m gonna have to say I don’t know that one.” Kamina looked over at his fellow looper. “Simon?”</p><p class="double">“Something something ships,” that unicorn deadpanned.</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, guys!”</p><p class="double">They turned, seeing an earth pony galloping towards them.</p><p class="double">“I thought it was you!” the earth pony said, as she slowed to a stop in front of them. “Hi, other loopers. I’m Yoko Littner, and I’m the one who keeps these two doofs out of trouble.”</p><p class="double">“How does that relate to a rifle?” Dash asked, looking at her cutie mark.</p><p class="double">“That’s because she uses the rifle to cause trouble that she then keeps <i>us</i> out of,” Simon joked.</p><p class="double">A flash of light and a cloud of smoke erupted twenty feet away.</p><p class="double">“Trixie… senses… awesomeness!”</p><p><hr></p><p>Celestia stood on the balcony of the library next to Twilight, and together they watched a giant robot get into a fist fight with the moon.</p><p class="double">“What is this, I don’t even…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged helplessly. “Hiccup did warn me about those two, but apparently he understated the case. It doesn’t help that they and Yoko managed to meet the three most compatible personalities our world has to offer, of course.” Especially when that seemed to have got the Elements working somehow.</p><p class="double">Celestia gave a slightly stunned nod. “Every time I think I am used to the infinite variety of the universe, something like this happens.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>23.9</p><p class="double"></p><p><u>Academic Excellence</u> (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">“I guess you’re all wondering why I called you here today.” Rainbow Dash looked over the group of pegasi she’d assembled at her cloud house.</p><p class="double">“Yeah?” Snowflake asked, in a normal voice for once. The six ponies weren’t all on the weather team, though of course they all knew each other more or less. It hadn’t been too long since the Hurricane Season.</p><p class="double">“I happen to know you’ve all applied to the basic training course at Wonderbolts Academy.” Dash smirked. “So have I.”</p><p class="double">“How could you know about that?” Cloudchaser gave her a puzzled look.</p><p class="double">“I have my ways…” Dash wasn’t going to tell them that they almost always the ones who got picked in every loop.</p><p class="double">“Don’t tell me you don’t want the competition!” Thunderlane exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Hardly!” Rainbow grinned. “Besides, you guys aren’t competition, unless any-pony’s feeling lucky…“</p><p class="double">Nobody was willing to take that bet. Dash sighed. “If anything I want to help you get better, be more awesome… unless you just want to take it easy and cruise through it, it’s up to you. I know a lot of ponies apply just to be able to show they could get in. Kind of a fillip on any-pony’s resume.”</p><p class="double">“What are the chances we’ll all get in anyway?” Cloudchaser was pacing around Dash’s living room. “I mean sure you’re a horseshoe-in, but we don’t have your skill, or your connections.”</p><p class="double">Dash actually frowned. “If I can’t get in on skill alone, I’m not going. But I think you guys impressed Spitfire during the Hurricane Day. For that matter, you impressed me. Getting back up in the air after it fell to pieces the first time took guts and stick-at-it-ness. I figure you’ve all got a good chance. I just want to see every-pony makes the most of it.”</p><p class="double">That made a couple of the ponies, who’d been wondering what was in it for Dash, feel a bit ashamed. Rainbow Dash had her faults, but no-pony could say she wasn’t loyal to her friends.</p><p class="double">Dash seemed to read what was going on in their heads. “I’ll admit there is something in it for me. I can kick out a top solo performance, blow the instructors wings off, but there’s more to being a Wonderbolt than just being the most awesome flyer. You’ve gotta work as part of a team. If every-pony from Ponyville turns up and works together, and gets the highest scores across the board, it’ll show I can lead a team, and get the best out of other ponies.</p><p class="double">“It’s not that different to Weather Patrol, just bucking out a performance at a higher level. Spitfire seemed pleased at the way I handled the Tornado drill, but I want to prove to her it wasn’t a fluke. I had an awesome team backing me and giving it everything they had then, and I hope we can do it again. So, if we do this, you guys get better results from your training course, and I get to show I’m more than an incredibly awesome solo flyer. Every-pony wins! ”</p><p class="double">She looked around. “So, are you guys in?” She held out a hoof and after a fraction of a second, the other hooves covered hers. “Okay, then we’re going to do this, and it’s going to be awesome!”</p><p class="double">“YEAH!”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>The cadets were lined up waiting to meet Spitfire. She walked past as usual.</p><p class="double">“Well lookie what we got here. Betcha&#039;ll think you&#039;re Wonderbolt material, don&#039;t ya?”</p><p class="double">Every-pony except Lightning Dust, who yelled out, “Yes ma’am!”, instead said, “Not yet ma’am!”</p><p class="double">That rather de-railed her standard ‘I am drill sergeant nasty’ speech. Still she recovered quickly. “Oh, so we have a class of wise guys, do we?”</p><p class="double">She eye-balled Cloud Chaser. “Are you a wise guy, rookie?”</p><p class="double">The weather pony would have quailed, if she hadn’t already spent hours getting the exact same thing from Rainbow Dash. Dash had warned them all about this, suggested some standard responses, and she wasn’t going to let the team down, though her eyes did flick towards the rainbow pegasus. She stood up straight and snapped out. “No, ma’am! Not a guy ma’am!”</p><p class="double">“Think you’re hot stuff?” Spitfire eye-balled Snowflake, who also remembered what Rainbow Dash had drilled into them, and didn’t flinch. “NO MA’AM!”</p><p class="double">Spitfire brushed back her mane into place and put on her glasses. Though she kept her expression stern, inwardly she was quite impressed. She could generally intimidate at least some of the rookies, but this lot seemed to have some grit to them. Though she suspected she knew who’d been the source of it all.</p><p class="double">Stopping by Rainbow Dash, she gave her the best top sergeant stare she knew. “You look like you&#039;re the worst flyer in the whole academy! You&#039;ll probably quit after the first day!”</p><p class="double">“No ma&#039;am! I&#039;ve been training for this since I was a foal, ma&#039;am!” Rainbow Dash couldn’t honestly say she’d never quit, as she had the first time round.</p><p class="double">“Let’s hope you learned something then.” Spitfire gave a tight smile and moved on to the one non-Ponyville pony, Lightning Dust.</p><p class="double">“Ha. What about you? Bet you couldn&#039;t fly past the first flagpole without getting winded.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust was her usual self. “Try me ma’am.”</p><p class="double">Perfect. She gave them 500 laps to prove themselves, and was surprised again that none of the Ponyville contingent complained. She didn’t expect it from Dash, but the others…</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash asked, “Is this a race ma’am?”</p><p class="double">Oho, sounded like Dash wanted to spread her wings too. “No. You’ll have plenty of chance to compete later.”</p><p class="double">Despite that, Lightning Dust had shot into the air and was making a maximum speed run, but Dash hadn’t followed her. Instead she was taking it slower. It was a few seconds before the Wonderbolt realised what the rainbow pegasus was doing. She was checking on each of the other ponies as she went past them, checking to see they were good to go, and giving them a wing-waggle of encouragement. It was only after she’d seen to each of them that she suddenly kicked up the velocity and started lapping them, though not as efficiently as Lightning Dust.</p><p class="double">That was odd, with the amount of effort she was putting out, she should be getting more speed… oh, now that was interesting. Some of the power was going into creating a trailing vortex wider than she was, and the other Ponyville pegasi were sliding in to catch it and gain an extra boost of speed as she went past them.</p><p class="double">While they wasn’t making anywhere near the speed Lightning Dust was putting out, as a group they were going faster than the slowest ponies could have managed on their own, and at that trick must take quite a bit of teamwork to maintain, not to mention both skill and power on Dash’s part. Maybe she <i>hadn’t</i> been asking for a race.</p><p class="double">Lightning came off the course first, and looked back with a bit of derision. “Finished, ma’am!”</p><p class="double">“Not bad for a rookie.” In fact she was pretty sure Lightning Dust had made one of the fastest ever times for a new recruit. “You’re dismissed, go get something to eat, you’re going to <i>need</i> your energy for tomorrow.”</p><p class="double">The rest of the new draft landed not much later. She was almost certain that they’d set a new record, for the fastest time for a whole class of cadets completing the five hundred. They landed in a line and pulled off an attention pose as well as any Wonderbolt. She waved them to the mess hall, but stopped Dash.</p><p class="double">“Well, rookie, what was that in aid of?”</p><p class="double">“What was what ma’am?” Dash started at a point two inches behind her right ear, in the traditional ‘enlisted pony trying not to answer a direct question’ pose.</p><p class="double">“Your little stunt with the vortex drift? Did you really think I wouldn’t notice?”</p><p class="double">“No, ma’am!” Dash tried to suppress a grin and mostly succeeded. “However it wasn’t a race, so there was nothing wrong with other ponies taking advantage of another pony’s air-wash to get around the track faster, ma’am. There was also nothing wrong with not going at my best speed, was there ma’am?”</p><p class="double">“Hmm…” Spitfire was quite enjoying this. This Dash was a lot less fan-girlish then the pony she’d met at the Gala a couple of years ago. She was taking quite a risk to effectively prank Spitfire, but somehow Spitfire didn’t feel it was because she thought she could take liberties due to the whole ‘having your life saved’ thing. “I’d have thought you’d take the opportunity to prove yourself.”</p><p class="double">“Yes ma’am. Was ma’am. Just not my speed ma’am.”</p><p class="double">It was clear, as if it hadn’t been before, that the whole thing was a set up. However, Spitfire, despite the demeanour she put on for the Academy, appreciated a good prank as much as any-pony. On Rainbow Dash’s part, organising it, anticipating Spitfire’s reactions, and simply having the brass hooves to pull it off demonstrated a lot of guts, initiative, and leadership, as well as skill. But she needed to make sure her authority wasn&#039;t being eroded.</p><p class="double">“And if I give you another thousand laps to give you the chance to show your full speed?”</p><p class="double">“Yes ma’am! Ready to go ma’am.” Rainbow raised her wings and tensed for take-off.</p><p class="double">Spitfire was tempted to make good on it, simply to see what she could do, but there was a difference between establishing the chain of command and being petty. “You’ll have plenty of chance to show off tomorrow, cadet. Hit the mess hall, you’re going to need your strength.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">As Rainbow Dash collected a meal from the mess hall counter and made her way over to the other Ponyville cadets, she got one or two sympathetic looks, which turned relieved at her cheerful expression. Before any-pony else could speak, Lightning Dust piped up.</p><p class="double">“Heh! Last one in? Well, I guess not every-pony can keep up that kind of speed. Not that you were as fast as me anyway.”</p><p class="double">That got her some acid looks from the other cadets.</p><p class="double">“Huh! Dash could run rings around you on her worst day if she wanted too!” Cloudchaser exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“It’s okay guys, I&#039;ve got this.” Rainbow Dash waved them down with a wing. “I’m Rainbow Dash. And you are…?”</p><p class="double">“Lightning Dust, as in I move like lightning and leave every-pony else in the dust!” The yellow and green pegasus declaimed.</p><p class="double">“Sounds awfully lonely out there on your own.” Rainbow quipped. “Y&#039;know, I wasn’t trying for the best time, at least not for myself. My friends here and I are all from Ponyville, and we’re looking out for each other. By the way guys, you did great! Perfect delivery, just what I’d hoped for, no, even better!”</p><p class="double">That got a number of grins and pleased looks from the Ponyville cadets, and Thunderlane and Milky Way even exchanged a high wing.</p><p class="double">“What?” Lightning Dust looked around at the other ponies. “What’re you talking about?”</p><p class="double">“There was a good chance that Spitfire was going to come out with something like ‘are you good enough’. Answer ‘yes’, you get told you aren’t, answer ‘no’, you get &#039;why are you here then?&#039; So we came up with some alternatives.”</p><p class="double">“You pranked Spitfire?” Lightning Dust’s eyes widened.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash grinned, “<i>We</i> pranked her, and because she’s an awesome pony, she let it slide. Well, I almost got a thousand extra laps for it, but it would have been totally worth it. Likewise, I was giving these guys a vortex tunnel to take advantage of. None of us were pulling our maximum speed, because none of us want to risk having to drop out due to a strain injury when we’ve just got here.”</p><p class="double">“Uh huh… “ Lightning Dust looked sceptical. “I always buck it to the max. If you don’t push yourself, how can you get better?”</p><p class="double">“I get you, but there’s more to being a Wonderbolt than just being an awesome flyer. You’re part of a team too, speaking of which, my friends over there are Thunderlane, Wildflower, Cloud Chaser and the big guy is Snowflake.” As she spoke, she gestured to each pony. “Over here we have Milky Way and Raindrops.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust snorted. “Like I’m going to remember all of that!”</p><p class="double">“Isn’t hard if you care about doing it. An earth pony named Pinkie Pie taught me that.” Rainbow shrugged, and dropped in between Lightning Dust and Raindrops. “Anyhow, we&#039;re going to rock this training course, and I figured you&#039;d want in, from the way you were pushing it out there.“</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t need any help rocking the course,” Lightning Dust gave an airy wave of her wing. “I&#039;m the best flyer in Los Pegasus, and I don&#039;t need any-pony slowing me down.”</p><p class="double">As little as a few hundred loops ago, Rainbow Dash would have made some hot retort about being the best in Equestria. However, with alicorn power levels to draw on, she really didn&#039;t have anything to prove. Besides, she understood the reason behind Lightning Dust&#039;s different attitude.</p><p class="double">Whenever she raced against Lightning Dust, she marked herself as a peer, someone like Lightning herself, though obviously not as good, and therefore worthy of notice. Here she hadn&#039;t, and the fact that she cared more about the other ponies then trying to excel herself meant Lightning Dust had shoved her onto the mental pile, &#039;lame and loving it&#039;. It was like Gilda all over again, why had she always attracted jerks as friends? Redeeming Dust wasn&#039;t one of her goals this loop, but she&#039;d have to see what could be done.</p><p class="double">In most close to original loops Lightning Dust wasn&#039;t kicked out of the Academy outright, even after she had her Lead pony badge stripped. Normally she got reassigned as Dash&#039;s wing-pony, and after she&#039;d gotten the attitude knocked out of her, she could be pretty cool. She just needed to lose that &#039;win at all costs&#039; mentality.</p><p class="double">Her thoughts hadn&#039;t stopped her speaking when some of the other ponies bridled at Dusty&#039;s attitude. “Heh, suit yourself. Maybe you&#039;ll change your mind when you see what we can do tomorrow.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust left as soon as she&#039;d finished eating, and almost before she was out of ear-shot, Cloud Chaser asked, “Why are you letting her talk like that? She&#039;s a complete jerk, and needs to be taken down a peg or two.”</p><p class="double">“She reminds me of me, not too long ago.”</p><p class="double">“You were never that bad!” Milky Way piped up.</p><p class="double">Rainbow blew a stray hair out of her face. “Maybe, but it took being around Twilight and the others to teach me there was more to life than being the best I could be, or that loyalty to my friends, to other ponies wasn&#039;t the same as loyalty to Ponyville and my job. You saw her out there, she&#039;s an awesome flyer, but if she doesn&#039;t figure out the rest of it, she&#039;s never going to make a Wonderbolt.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ve got each other, she&#039;s got no-pony else to rely on. I don&#039;t think her attitude has made her many friends back in Los Pegasus either. So she&#039;s decided she doesn&#039;t need them. I&#039;m trying to get her to see she&#039;s wrong, but it won&#039;t work if we gang up on her, shut her out. By the way, thanks every-pony for following my lead on that. “</p><p class="double">There was a chorus on the general theme of &#039;No problem&#039; with added, &#039;You&#039;ve got us this far.&#039; Thunderlane added, “Besides, like you said, we&#039;ll show her what we can do tomorrow, on the Dizzitron.”</p><p class="double">Wildflower looked slightly nervous. “Ooh, I am not looking forward to that. What if I mess up?”</p><p class="double">“Relax, just stick with what we&#039;ve practised and do your best.” She held up a hoof, brought it to a stop in mid-air, then dropped it and guided it down in a curve to sweep horizontal to the table. “Stop, drop and roll out. Trust me, Apple Bloom&#039;s mock-up was designed to the same spec as the real thing. You&#039;ve done it before, I&#039;ve seen you do it, and I know you have nothing to worry about.”</p><p class="double">Thunderlane scratched the back of his neck with a hoof. “Who&#039;d of figured Applejack&#039;s kid sister was that good with gadgets?”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash grinned to herself, thinking of how they&#039;d freak out if they saw what the looping filly had in her underground garage. An alicorn didn&#039;t need a spaceship, but some of the space fighters she rigged up were massive fun to fly. She might take the time tonight to pop back there and see what she could take for a spin, or maybe just ride the wing while Scootaloo flew. No, best get an early night, she had a long day tomorrow.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Lined up in front of the Dizzitron, all the ponies except Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust looked slightly ill at ease. Rainbow Dash had decided to take her usual place, which should mean she&#039;d be picked before Lightning Dust. She wasn&#039;t going to let the other pony&#039;s time affect her own performance either way. Spitfire was going through her introductory spiel.</p><p class="double">“… Your task is to try and recover and fly straight again, as soon as possible. Once you have recovered you must come in for a smooth landing. Now, who&#039;s first?” Wildflower caught her attention. “You. You&#039;re up. “</p><p class="double">“Me... I mean, yes ma&#039;am!” The pink pegasus gulped and started towards the machine, suppressing a shiver. &#039;It&#039;s okay, it&#039;s just like back on Sweet Apple Acres. Stop, drop and roll out. Just pretend it&#039;s a fairground ride, a very fast, very scary fairground ride...”</p><p class="double">As she strapped herself in, she looked back at the line of ponies and saw nothing but confidence from her fellows. She even saw Dash give her a wing-tip up before she pulled down her goggles, and heard the pegasus&#039;s voice from last night. &#039;You&#039;ve done it before, I&#039;ve seen you do it, and I know you have nothing to worry about.&#039;</p><p class="double">She felt some confidence return, if Dash thought she could do it, who was she to argue? She <i>could</i> do this. Her voice was steady when she called out. “Okay, I&#039;m ready!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, go!” Spitfire called.</p><p class="double">The Dizzitron started spinning her, and she got the familiar feeling of her stomach wanting to leave her body through one of many convenient exits. But... it was nothing she hadn&#039;t felt before. Her confidence started to grow. Actually doing this was a lot less scary than thinking about doing it. She tucked her head in, pulled her wings and legs in tight, closed her eyes and focussed...</p><p class="double">“Release!”</p><p class="double">She was flung away through the air... this wasn&#039;t even as bad as when the hurricane collapsed.</p><p class="double">&#039;Stop...&#039;</p><p class="double">Her wings snapped out along with her legs, and the change in angular momentum combined with the air resistance of her wings as she pushed weather magic through them slowed her wild tumble. However, she still didn&#039;t open her eyes, just folded her wings back and let herself fall.</p><p class="double">&#039;… drop...&#039;</p><p class="double">She felt the wind rush past her and guide her body into line with the fall like a shuttlecock. Finally she could open her eyes, and saw the ground was still an acceptable distance below.</p><p class="double">&#039;… roll out.&#039;</p><p class="double">Having built up air speed, she used the wind rather than her still off kilter sense of balance to orient herself and opened her wings out to a glide, pulling a curve that brought her in to scrape her hooves against the runway. She trotted out and came to a stop as her head stopped spinning. She even found the will to look over towards Spitfire without throwing up.</p><p class="double">“Nine seconds... Acceptable.” Actually the Wonderbolt leader was quite impressed. Nine seconds wasn&#039;t an amazing time, but it was better than ninety percent of recruits managed on their first run. Of course, it was quite clear from the practised way she&#039;d reacted that this wasn&#039;t her first run, and Spitfire was fairly sure who&#039;d made sure of that.</p><p class="double">She must have been taking a lot of notes that time she came there as her reward for winning the Young Fliers competition. Not that the details of the training routine was classified or anything, but it wouldn&#039;t have been simple to get. Spitfire added another tick in her mental check-list of the rainbow pegasus&#039;s talents. Good intel made for safer flying.</p><p class="double">Wildflower hadn&#039;t heard the faint praise. She reverse punched the air. Yes! She&#039;d beaten the ten second barrier, her best time ever! As she returned to the line, she sneaked a grin towards Rainbow Dash and got a pleased smirk and another wing-tip up in return.</p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash, since you&#039;re fidgeting, you&#039;re clearly eager to go!” Spitfire turned her gaze on Dash.</p><p class="double">“Yes ma&#039;am!” Dash kept her grin. “But if it&#039;s all the same to you, could you turn that doohickey up to top speed?”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Spitfire didn&#039;t actually know why she was surprised. If any-pony was going to want to go all the way, it was Dash. But that speed was what she and the the other active Wonderbolts members trained on. “It&#039;s your funeral.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash seemed completely unconcerned as the level was switched all the way over. The device spun up to ludicrous speed, and at Spitfire&#039;s command, they triggered the release. There was a crack and an explosion of miniature rainbows from the hurtling figure as her wing-tips extended at more than the speed of sound, and the single flap she gave didn&#039;t just arrest her motion but sent her bulleting back towards the runway with a rainbow contrail.</p><p class="double">She landed with another crack as the macadam of the runway crunched slightly under her hooves leaving a visible mark. Spitfire had expected something exceptional, but that had her so flustered, she almost forgot to stop her stopwatch. “Three point two seconds?!”</p><p class="double">Dear sweet Celestia! Spitfire&#039;s own best time was four point six, and the best time ever recorded was three point nine. Still she couldn&#039;t exactly say that. “That&#039;s an Academy record. Looks like you do have something on the ball, after all.”</p><p class="double">She noticed that the other ponies looked pleased except for Lightning Dust who looked like she&#039;d flown into a cloud filled with rocks. Cloud chaser reached under her chin and pushed her jaw back up, which seemed to bring her out of her stupor. Interesting that they were happy for her despite the fact that she&#039;d just blown them all right out of the sky with that performance.</p><p class="double">What was more, Dash was just trotting back into line. Apart from a grin and a couple of slight nods of acknowledgement that Spitfire probably wasn&#039;t supposed to see, she wasn&#039;t making a big thing out of it.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust followed, and also chose the top speed, pulling a hoof-first drop and fly out in a respectable six and a half seconds. Most of the others were quite happy to throttle it back to regular speed, but none of them put in a performance of worse than ten seconds, even Thunderlane, who tried intermediate speed, and still managed a nine point seven. None of them ended up losing their balance or their lunch afterwards, either.</p><p class="double">This group of recruits was shaping up to be exceptional group of trainees, and Spitfire was certain as to who&#039;s fault that was in all but one case. She considered what to do about that one case, who was currently glaring at Rainbow Dash. She&#039;d have to consider what she was going to do about that situation.</p><p class="double">“Listen up! For the rest of the camp, you&#039;ll be working in pairs. &#039;Morrow morning, I&#039;ll post the teams, including who&#039;ll be lead pony and who&#039;ll be wing-pony. Good luck.”</p><p class="double">She watched the group dynamic as she dismissed them, Dash was clearly the centre of attention, but she was equally clearly complimenting the others performances. Lightning Dust seemed to be left out on the edges, but the key was what happened when Dash turned to her and offered a hoof-bump. Lightning Dust just turned away and headed for the barracks.</p><p class="double">Yes, something would definitely have to be done about that. </p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>23.10</p><p class="double">“Hi, Princess,” Twilight said, trotting into the throne room. “I – oh.”</p><p class="double">“Hello!” Cadence said from the throne, passing some just-signed papers over to an official. “Nice to see you.”</p><p class="double">“You too,” Twilight replied, nodding. “Only… I was expecting to find Princess Celestia. Any idea where she is?”</p><p class="double">“What, don’t you love me any more?”</p><p class="double">“That’s my brother’s job these days, isn’t it?” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“Fair point,” Cadence agreed, incidentally confirming a number of rumours in front of witnesses. “And no, she just asked me to spot her for the Summer Sun celebration.”</p><p class="double">That <i>was</i> interesting. Cadence wasn’t Awake this time, but apparently Celestia <i>was</i>. And… no, there wasn’t enough information to go on.</p><p class="double">“Well, if I can’t find her I suppose I’ll have to make do,” Twilight mock-sighed. “How have you been?”</p><p class="double">“Still learning the business of ruling, actually,” Cadence replied. “Celestia was kind enough to mostly clear the decks, though, so it’s not too onerous. I’m sure it amounts to a test.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded along. “Sensible.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Nightmare Moon crept along corridors, seeking her sister. At first she’d thought her goal might be Ponyville, but further investigation had revealed that the alicorn to be appearing there was a stripling she’d never heard of.</p><p class="double">The Nightmare idly pondered if perhaps this ‘Cadence’ was some by-blow of Celestia’s or something, then brushed the thought off as she reached Celestia’s private chambers.</p><p class="double">There was a sign dangling on the door.</p><p class="double">Frowning, Moon squinted at it. “Gone… surfing?”</p><p><hr></p><p>Celestia blazed across the night sky in a corona of plasma, her tungsten and carbon-carbon surfboard humming as it dissipated reentry compression heating.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm, not as good as I was expecting…” she said critically, adjusting the angle of attack minutely. “It’s all much of a muchness. So much for the idea that the night would bring different pressure.”</p><p class="double">Movement caught her eye, and she focused a complex scrying spell to zoom in.</p><p class="double">Well, that was interesting. By luck, it appeared she was on a rough interception course with a stealthily-flying Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">Several plans ran though the Alicorn’s mind. After some careful consideration, she selected plan G.</p><p><hr></p><p>Nightmare Moon had the air knocked out of her by a near-sonic speed impact that hit her from her right rear.</p><p class="double">“…eeeeeeeEEEEEEEEE SIS! So glad you’re back!” Celestia’s voice shouted, high-pitched with excitement.</p><p class="double">The alicorn of darkness had been well prepared for battle, for rhetoric, for subtlety. Being glomped, however, was totally outside her expectations.</p><p class="double">“<i>Celly?!”</i></p><p class="double">“Oh, Lulu, I missed you so much!” Celestia said, still gleeful, and hugging the other alicorn so hard her ribs creaked.</p><p class="double">Then the princess of the day frowned. “Hey, do you remember how to slow down? ‘cause we’re about to hit a tree.”</p><p class="double">FLUMPH.</p><p><hr></p><p>“This is so much fun!” Celestia said, grinning. “I get to act like the little sister for once!”</p><p class="double">“I still don’t get how you fixed her…” Twilight muttered. “I mean, about all you did that I can see is you body-checked her into a tree.”</p><p class="double">“I <i>glomped</i> her, Twilight,” Celestia corrected, still smiling. “Hugs fix everything.”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.” Twilight looked over at the confused Princess Luna. “Hey, should I tell her there’s a twig in her mane?”</p><p class="double">Celestia shrugged. “I think it looks nice.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='24'></a><h3>Loops 24</h3>
<p>24.1</p><p class="double">Sir Spykoran, Pandion Knight of the kingdom of Elenia, rode into Daros on his ridiculously evil horse Angel on a rainy night.</p><p class="double">“Oh, stop it,” he said without any real heat. “You’re just showing off because Fluttershy isn’t here...”</p><p class="double">The big animal tossed his head, rolled his eyes, then surged forward again.</p><p><hr></p><p>“So,” he said, as someone who was a childhood friend this loop left the room, “what’s up here, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight, instructor of magic for the Pandion Knights, shrugged. It was easier than normal, since – like Spike himself – she was human. “Not all that sure. I do know that you’re supposed to end up as a prince consort, but aside from that and that you need to save the queen, not much.”</p><p class="double">“I do?” Spike frowned. “How do you know that?”</p><p class="double">“Two reasons.” She reached into nothingness, and pulled out a large book. “First off, I found this in my fiction stash.”</p><p class="double">“The Elenium.” Spike took it and glanced at the back cover. “Neat. Good to have the guidebook for a new loop.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, and I’ll be finished with it once I get a chance. But the other reason is the queen’s name.”</p><p class="double">Spike scanned back through Loop memories. “Oh. Yeah, Queen Rarity is a fairly good hint.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly. Now, you’re going to need to be quite the swordsman here. Up to it?”</p><p class="double">A shrug. “Yeah, though I’ll need to remember not to slip and start using something like Soresu again. Kind of over the top, right?”</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. “Actually, that might be quite funny. I don’t think you’re supposed to be able to deflect arrows.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good. Anything else I should know?”</p><p class="double">“Well… yes, actually.” Twilight raised her hands, and spoke words in an arcane tongue.</p><p class="double">With a pop, Nyx materialized on the sofa. “Hi, Twilight! Ooh, you’re human again. So this is… Spike?”</p><p class="double">“Good guess.” Spike offered a hand, and Nyx put her hoof into it for a shake. “Nice to have you here.”</p><p class="double">“It’s good to be here! Okay, basically, I’m the goddess of children here. Or the child goddess, or whatever… I stay young because when I’m young people give me treats more often-”</p><p class="double">“Sounds about right,” Spike interjected with a grin.</p><p class="double">Nyx stuck her tongue out. “Anyway, Momma-Twilight is kind of my current high priest, so I’m with you all the way.” She looked a bit embarrassed, then. “Hey, can you teach me how to turn into a human, Twilight? I’m gonna be kind of out of place…”</p><p class="double">“Well, there is another option.” Twilight pulled a blanket from her subspace pocket. “I could just have a riding pony.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, no.” Nyx crossed her hooves, and looked away with an ostentatious hmf.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight shrugged. “Right, we’ll work on that tomorrow. I should show Spike where the Queen is before we get going on the Epic Quest™.”</p><p class="double">“…how did you do that?” Spike asked, frowning.</p><p class="double">“Do what?” Twilight replied, covering a grin.</p><p><hr></p><p>Spike gazed at the flawlessly pure crystal that held the frozen form of Queen Rarity of Elenium.</p><p class="double">“…is it kind of wrong that I find both her and the thing she’s in extremely attractive for entirely different reasons?” he asked absently.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked, then looked amused. “Down, boy. And you can’t eat gemstones here, so don’t try.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah…” he shrugged, still staring. “Can we take this crystal thing with us?”</p><p class="double">“Glutton.”</p><p class="double">Spike chose to ignore that.</p><p class="double">After a minute he frowned. “Hey, why don’t we just let her out now?”</p><p class="double">“Poison.” Twilight shrugged. “Book says the only way to cure it is to pick up a thing called the Bhelliom, so off we go.”</p><p class="double">“Anyone coming with us?”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “The book has a list of people who come with us, but I honestly don’t know if we need to bother. Just us is a lot faster, anyway, and we know where we’re going. Hey, Nyx?”</p><p class="double">A flash of dark-light. “Yeah?”</p><p class="double">“Can you teleport us to… here?” Twilight pointed at a map.</p><p class="double">“Yep! All aboard!” Nyx spread her wings and flared her horn-</p><p><hr></p><p>“The hell is this thing?” Spike asked, squinting at the object of their quest. “This is the Bhelliom?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, no,” Twilight admitted. “The Bhelliom is supposed to be a big flower-shape in reddish sapphire. This… seems to be the Elements of Harmony crudely welded together.”</p><p class="double">“I was in a hurry, so sue me.” Discord came out of the back room, only to see all three other Loopers present glaring at him. “Oh, what? You knew I was going to be here somewhere.”</p><p class="double">“No, actually, we didn’t,” Twilight corrected him.</p><p class="double">“Okay, so maybe I forgot to set up that beacon thing-”</p><p class="double">“Again,” Twilight, her adoptive brother, and her adoptive daughter chorused. Discord was terrible at remembering to let others know he was in a fused loop… probably deliberately.</p><p class="double">“…fine, then.” Discord snapped his fingers, and time stopped. “Want to take it and walk back? I’m sure it’ll confuse that creep Annias if you cure the Queen within a night.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, alright.” Twilight took a wand out of subspace. “Shall I take us back?”</p><p class="double">“No, no, no…” The draconequus waved a finger. “You have to walk. And if you don’t believe me, check that book again. It does you good.”</p><p class="double">He vanished before Twilight could try to strangle him.</p><p class="double">Spike sighed. “Wish we’d brought Angel, now…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Kalten opened the door, then blinked as Spike and Twilight trooped back in – both of them in ragged clothing and looking terribly unwashed.</p><p class="double">“Where have you been?” he asked, sniffing and wrinkling his nose.</p><p class="double">“Eosia,” Spike replied, making a beeline for the baths.</p><p class="double">“Very funny. I know you were on the continent, now where in this city where you?”</p><p class="double">“No, that’s as specific as he can be…” Twilight said, on her way past to the second bathing chamber. “We went a long way.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Right…” Twilight slipped her hands through the central voids of two necklaces, then paused. “I can manage any two, possibly three, but that’s about it without a Queen of the Moon. Spike?”</p><p class="double">“Loyalty is easy… I think I can do Generosity, too,” Spike replied, taking a deep breath.</p><p class="double">Nyx appeared again. “I pick laughter!”</p><p class="double">“You get it. And honesty, too.” Twilight disentangled the elements, and passed them out. “I hope this works… we’re kind of off script.”</p><p><hr></p><p>It took ten minutes – nine of them with Nyx going ewww and Twilight tapping her foot – before Spike and Rarity stopped kissing.</p><p class="double">“Well, that was… interesting,” Twilight managed. “Now, we do sort of have a little matter of an evil deity to cope with.”</p><p class="double">Discord slid into the room through a window, and got promptly blasted out again by Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Pax!” he shouted, feeling his nose. “I tink you broke it…”</p><p class="double">“You made us walk two thousand miles!”</p><p class="double">“To end up at your door…” Discord sang tunelessly. He then coughed, as Twilight raised what looked like an Intelligent Device threateningly. “Yes, well. I can run Laughter just as well as anyone, and I think that irritating bunny that’s currently a horse can operate Kindness-”</p><p class="double">This time everyone snorted with laughter.</p><p class="double">“Honesty, then. And if your little pony here can use Kindness, we have a full set.” Discord folded his arms. “Look, I have competition here. And I have a lot more style than that debased moron Azash.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, almost against her will. “I must admit, you do tend to prefer a joke to a human sacrifice.”</p><p class="double">Discord smiled with some old memory. “The old inflatable obsidian dagger trick gets ‘em every time…”</p><p class="double">“I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that,” Twilight said loftily.</p><p><hr></p><p>“What is the meaning of this?” Annias asked, looking around him. Surreptitiously, he tried to cast a spell, and nothing happened.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Twilight gave a bright smile. “Spike and I retrieved an ancient artefact, walked the length of the continent, cured the Queen, and destroyed the Elder God Azash. And now I’d like to have breakfast.”</p><p class="double">“And what is that at the table?” The Primate of Cimmura pointed to Discord, who waved.</p><p class="double">“A smart-arse,” Spike answered glibly. “Oh, any objections to me and the Queen living in sin? Probably not, you’ve certainly got practise at it.”</p><p class="double">Annias’s mouth opened and closed like a fish.</p><p class="double">Then Angel kicked him in the back of the knee.</p><p class="double">“Four out of ten for force, but ten for style and timing,” Discord said, raising a glass of something which looked like petrol. “You’re not all bad, you ill tempered nutcase you.”</p><p class="double">Angel trotted over and kicked him smartly in the ribs.</p><p class="double">“I deserved that,” Discord said without qualm.</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight kicked a studious-looking man in the shins, and then kneed him in the chin as he collapsed. “No thank you, Zalasta.”</p><p class="double">“But…” he gasped up at her.</p><p class="double">She ignored him, and pretended not to notice when Discord started to paint clown makeup on him. “So much for that Power Behind the Scenes. Actually having the book to read does kind of short circuit a lot of plots… What now?”</p><p class="double">Nyx appeared next to her. “I think the Tamuli Gods sound fun! They’re kind of like Pinkie, only… no, there is no only. They’re like Pinkie.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good to me.” Twilight looked over at Discord. “Take care of him for me, will you?”</p><p class="double">Discord nodded, idly inverting Zalasta’s magic. “Look for me… actually, no, having a schedule would be counterproductive. I’ll be somewhere.” A pause. “Probably.” Another pause. “Actually, no, never mind, forget I said anything. Just do stuff and I might turn up.”</p><p><hr></p><p>24.2</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle!” Trixie boomed, appearing in Ponyville town square with a flash of sickly red light. Great, partially-there wings of ruddy light cast shadows on the walls, and a red amulet shone like a star at her throat. “I have returned, so come out and face me!”</p><p class="double">After the standard-issue two minutes of utter panic, Twilight stepped from her house. Her own Element of Magic shone on her forehead, and it looked as though she had the faint hint of wings herself. “Trixie Lulamoon. I was expecting you.”</p><p class="double">“As you should have been!” Trixie pulled a book out of nowhere. “This is really good, but it’s four weeks since I borrowed it.”</p><p class="double">“Actually,” Twilight corrected, “four weeks and one day. It’s overdue.”</p><p class="double">The last word there seemed to shake all the windows in Ponyville, for all that it was spoken in a whisper.</p><p class="double">Trixie gulped, but tried to disguise it. “Well, what do you expect? I can’t find any other copies of it!”</p><p class="double">“That’s because it’s a first edition of a private printing. Only a hundred were made, because the pony doing it had to pay the full printing costs herself and they were high for so few – economies of scale. All the others are privately owned.” Twilight took a moment to look the copy of On Palomino Station over. “At least it isn’t damaged.”</p><p class="double">Her gaze tracked up to Trixie’s eyes. “It is undamaged, isn’t it?”</p><p class="double">Trixie chuckled weakly. “Er… aheh… I was reading it in the rain?”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “I see.” The Element of Magic flashed, and the spectres of wings hardened into solidity.</p><p class="double">The blue unicorn held up the book as though it was a shield, and with a flash of red matched Twilight’s transformation. “You can’t fight me, I’m holding a book!”</p><p class="double">Twilight picked it out of her grasp with telekinesis and sent it into the library.</p><p class="double">“…oh.” Trixie looked around. “No hard feelings?”</p><p class="double">There was a bang as Twilight fired off a particle-beamer spell, which flashed off Trixie’s shields. The blue alicorn spread her wings and took off. “It was only a bit of damp!”</p><p class="double">“Overdue AND damaged!” Twilight shouted, taking to the air herself. “That’s practically treason!”</p><p class="double">The residents of ponyville blinked in the confusion, some of them looking after the rapidly receding combatants. It was about three minutes later that the explosions really got going.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Thanks, Trixie,” Twilight said that evening, in a restaurant in Cloudsdale. Both Loopers were under slight glamours, and compounding that by having exploited Star Swirl’s last spell to turn into pegasi. “I was having trouble with a few ponies not treating books right.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded, taking another drink. “You are scary when books are involved.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, slightly uncomfortable. “Sorry about that, I think you ended up taking about three decades’ worth of built up stress.”</p><p class="double">“Think nothing of it,” Trixie assured, though her wings were still slightly open in an unconscious flight reaction. Noticing, she furled them more fully. “Anyway,” she said, more naturally, “That book wasn’t half bad. Bit formulaic, but…”</p><p class="double">“I’ll let Dash know,” Twilight said with a grin. “Iris Drake is a pseudonym she uses when writing.”</p><p class="double">Trixie tried to reconcile the brash pegasus with a writer. Then she thought a bit more about the kind of book she’d been reading.</p><p class="double">Restraint had not figured very much. A heroic pegasus captain capable of sonic rainbooms had – as, indeed, had a unicorn Marine mage with illusion speciality. “…oh! So that’s who she based everypony off.”</p><p class="double">“Mostly.” Twilight glanced around, mainly out of habit. “A lot of the stuff in there actually happened, a long time back. You do make a good Marine.”</p><p class="double">“Trixie is intrigued. And demands she gets a copy of the next book.”</p><p class="double">“Good luck,” Twilight replied with a laugh. “She’s been putting off that thing for a millennium.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Well, that’s better,” Twilight said, noting the neatly stacked pile of returns on the counter. “Nothing like a bit of a friendly reminder to encourage ponies to behave.”</p><p class="double">Spike ran over. “Twilight, the Princess turned up while you were out. I told her what happened, and she… well, she left again, very confused. And wondering if she’d been drinking too much of something called moonshine?”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. Good thing I already thought of a cover story…</p><p><hr></p><p>24.3</p><p class="double">Twilight stifled a giggle, holding her hand over her mouth.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah…” Naruto Uzumaki muttered, as some of the other Anchors with less restraint than Twilight started laughing at him.</p><p class="double">For whatever reason, this world had given all the Loopers present little animal ears and a tail, and otherwise enforced human body form. Some of them carried it off rather well, but the fox tail Naruto had ended up with was just too poofy to take seriously.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what’s the gimmick here?” Ranma asked, idly looking his own random cat tail over. “I mean, this can’t be it…”</p><p class="double">“Glad you asked!” said the local Anchor, Cinque. “This place has all kinds of strange rules, but number one is that death is impossible here.”</p><p class="double">“Impossible meaning…” Ichigo asked, having a lot of experience with the definition of words like ‘die’.</p><p class="double">“Basically, if you take what would otherwise be a lethal hit on a battlefield-”</p><p class="double">There was a very big bang from the other side of the field. A smouldering cat with a lightning-bolt scar landed in front of them, uncurled, and then said something obscene.</p><p class="double">“…that.” Cinque pointed at the luckless Potter. “Usually you end up more chibi, but there’s variance. It wears off eventually.”</p><p class="double">He looked around. “Though I have to say, this particular battlefield is huge. I’ve never seen one remotely this big…”</p><p class="double">The Anchors exchanged sidelong glances.</p><p class="double">“Wait…” Shinji said, slowly. “Does this mean a completely guilt free, no consequences-”</p><p class="double">Lina Inverse acted first, rattling off the incantation to Dragon Slave in a little under two seconds, and then things got quite complicated.</p><p><hr></p><p>Eventually, Twilight found herself in a smouldering crater four hundred feet deep, and back to being a unicorn.</p><p class="double">“Gotcha!” Nanoha called from above, showing a V-sign and flying off.</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned, then tested something. It worked.</p><p class="double">Slowly, a grin spread over her face.</p><p><hr></p><p>Nanoha was looking around for another target when a twinned, knock-off copy of her own Force Burst slammed into the back of her shield and sent her flying forwards.</p><p class="double">Turning, she stabilized and looked for her attacker.</p><p class="double">“Hi!” Twilight said brightly. “Did you know that my magic still works like this?”</p><p class="double">Nanoha sent mental commands to Raising Heart, which switched into a rather more dangerous setting, and loaded in two cartridges. “Right, then. Rematch?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Sounds good. Besides, I want to be as far from there as possible.”</p><p class="double">A nod indicated somewhere about forty miles north, which seemed to be where Naruto, Ranma, Ichigo and Lina had congregated. Things just kept exploding.</p><p class="double">Nanoha shivered. “Right. I don’t fancy being a…” she took the time to actually look her accoutrements over. “…well, apparently I’d end up as a dog?”</p><p class="double">“Nothing wrong with dogs.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” The human mage shrugged. “But I don’t fancy using dog shampoo.”</p><p class="double">“That’s silly.” Twilight lit her horn, layering defensive spells and Ascending to restore her flight capabilities. “You know, I wonder if this world was an accident… it can’t be normal to have this many Anchors around.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Told you,” Inari said smugly. “Naruto is clearly the best Anchor in a fight. As it should be.”</p><p class="double">Skuld scowled across the scrying pool. “It’s not over yet, missy! Besides, if Ranma gets turned into a cat, that’s just asking for the Neko-ken!”</p><p class="double">The various deities who spoke for major Loops started squabbling amongst themselves.</p><p class="double">In the corner, Loki chuckled. Noticing, an eight legged horse deity – Sleipnir – stepped over. “What is it, mom?”</p><p class="double">Loki shook his head. “Don’t call me that.” The words didn’t have any real heat to them. “Anyway, I was just thinking that my own champion of sorts in this little comparison has the best idea.”</p><p class="double">Sleipnir focused. “Oh, I see. The little Haddock would appear to be running for it. Is that allowed?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” The God of Trickery clapped his son – it’s complicated – on the fore right shoulder. “I wrote the rules, so of course it’s allowed. Though I must say, that pony of yours is doing well.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle has something of a flair, yes,” Sleipnir allowed. “And it helps that she can’t really be disabled here.”</p><p class="double">On the world of Flonyard, something very big detonated. The eight-legged horse winced. “I think that may, however, give her at least a headache.”</p><p><hr></p><p>24.4 (Anowack)</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight Sparkle had experienced many strange variations of her home loop in her countless years as a Looper. There had been loops where she awoke in a frozen world that had suffered Nightmare Moon&#039;s eternal night for a thousand years. There had been loops where Discord was the beloved ruler of Equestria and ponies thrived in his chaos. There had been loops where everypony&#039;s gender was reversed and loops where Celestia ruled the night while Luna claimed the day. Loops where Celestia had trained Twilight in the ancient art of pony ninjutsu and loops where Cadance had been her Unicorn Tennis coach.</p><p class="double">Her long experience with this infinite variety usually gave Twilight more than enough equanimity to handle whatever new twists and turns each loop brought. If one loop&#039;s Shining Armor was a cold, distant brother, or if another loop&#039;s Twilight had never discovered her love of magic, Twilight could deal with it. Most such problems could be corrected, often without ever overtly breaking character as her pre-loop self, and those that could not could be endured for a brief lifetime. In the long run, very little of it mattered. It wasn&#039;t worth getting upset over.</p><p class="double">This loop took less than a minute – just long enough for the first loop memories to finish settling in – to make Twilight Sparkle furious.</p><p class="double">She awoke in a familiar location on the palace grounds, pouring over the legend of Nightmare Moon. This version, though similar in the broad strokes to the usual tale, contained no mention of the Elements of Harmony, but Twilight barely had time to consider that before the other, more disturbing changes came to her attention.</p><p class="double">On her flank, where her familiar starburst should have been, was a patch of dull gray fur shaped in the image of Princess Celestia&#039;s sun. Twilight gaped at it for several long moments. When the solidifying loop memories told her what it meant, her face twisted and she stood, leaving the book of lore lying on the grass.</p><p class="double">The brand marked her position as Princess Celestia&#039;s personal slave.</p><p class="double">“Buck this loop,” Twilight declared, and she summoned her Element of Magic to her forehead with but a thought, wings sprouting from her sides as the gray brand shattered and revealed her cutie mark. Their connection told her all five of her friends were Awake this loop. While on the one hoof she hated they had to see this loop&#039;s mockery of everything they loved, on the other hoof she would have hated having to deal with this alone.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was the closest, somewhere in Canterlot. Magic flared, and when Celestia&#039;s guards came to investigate the surge minutes later all they found was an abandoned, forgotten tome of legends.</p><p><hr></p><p>“So... I take it we aren&#039;t playing along this loop, then?” Rainbow Dash asked the furious alicorn who had just burst through the wall of her – actually surprisingly luxurious – quarters in the back of a small estate just outside the palace.</p><p class="double">“No, really,” Twilight said dryly, flapping her wings once. “What was your first clue?”</p><p class="double">“Good, because I was not planning to spend another minute owned by Prince Blueblood.” A necklace appeared around the pegasus&#039;s neck and a moment later a horn grew on her head. “I think I was supposed to do something stupid tomorrow at the games tomorrow anyway.”</p><p class="double">Twilight forced herself to examine the distasteful loop memories. Celestia had been planning to attend the... ugh... gladiatorial games in honor of the thousandth anniversary of her victory over her sister, where as the main event reigning champion Spitfire was going to face a hot new fighter... “I think I would have been there,” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I think I was going to try taking you hostage to bargain for my freedom,” Rainbow said. She snorted. “I don&#039;t think I was really thinking things through very well.”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle had gotten good at figuring out how loops were &#039;supposed&#039; to go. “Pre-loop me was secretly studying teleportation magic,” she said. “I bet she&#039;d have used it to get both of us away during the confusion when Luna showed up.” Then finding the others while on the run, probably discovering or creating the Elements, and a war against Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">Two unicorn guards poked their heads in through the hole in the wall, horns glowing with explosive spells. Twilight casually teleported them through the palace wards and into Celestia&#039;s private restroom mere heartbeats before their spells finished casting.</p><p class="double">“Where to?” was all Rainbow asked.</p><p class="double">“It feels like Applejack is closest, probably in Ponyville. Fluttershy&#039;s not far... Everfree? And then Rarity and Pinkie Pie are up north somewhere.”</p><p class="double">Twin sonic booms shattered every window in downtown Canterlot as the two alicorns accelerated out of the city.</p><p><hr></p><p>They found Applejack easily enough, near what should have been Ponyville but was instead a vast apple plantation owned by Filthy Rich. The orange mare insisted that they take the time to free her family – which Twilight didn&#039;t disagree with in the slightest, but which allowed a party of guards sent from Canterlot to catch up with them.</p><p class="double">That had put an end to Twilight&#039;s hopes that she&#039;d been hasty and Celestia was looping.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, she&#039;d been in the middle of testing a spell to remove the Apple Family&#039;s slave brands – which were actually fairly complicated constructs that packed a suite of tracking markers and punishment triggers along with what Twilight considered a “mini-Discording” that helped suppress rebellious emotions at the cost of also stopping the slaves from finding their talents and earning their cutie marks. It might have been fun to reverse engineer such a novel and complex spell if it wasn&#039;t a nasty abomination that went against everything pony magic should have stood for.</p><p class="double">Even more fortunately, Celestia, or whoever her guard captain was (thankfully not Shining Armor), had not considered the difficulties involved with sending a guard force whose rank-and-file was enslaved to stop a nascent slave rebellion, and a mass variant of Twilight&#039;s new counterspell backed by the power of three alicorns sufficed to turn the bulk of the enemy to their side. (A just as powerful mass teleport sent the rest packing back to Canterlot.)</p><p class="double">They&#039;d met Fluttershy an hour later at the edge of the Everfree Forest, and after a brief discussion the four alicorns had relocated the freed ponies to the precarious haven of the Palace of the Royal Pony Sisters. Fluttershy had lived there as a fugitive slave for almost a decade; with any luck it would stay safe for the next few days.</p><p class="double">With a promise to return shortly, they headed north in search of their two remaining friends.</p><p><hr></p><p>Five alicorns (Pinkie Pie had joined them in mid-journey, already ascended) circled in the air above the black spires of the corrupted Crystal Empire, and Twilight Sparkle &#039;s stomach was sick.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t the terrible dark crystal or the miasma of despair – she&#039;d seen the Empire under Sombra&#039;s rule at least a dozen times, though this was the first time he ruled as Celestia&#039;s vassal. Nor was it the moon – which had lost the dark visage of the Mare in the Moon right on schedule and failed to set in the hours since.</p><p class="double">It was the fact that half the banners below – and half the flanks of the crystal ponies who barely looked up to see the five ponies in the air above – bore Cadance&#039;s cutie mark. Celestia was bad enough, but to think that she would have to also see a slaving mockery of Cadance...</p><p class="double">As if in answer to her thoughts, a pink figure launched herself from a balcony below.</p><p class="double">Twilight steeled herself. Rarity was somewhere below, and for some reason had not yet ascended or joined her friends, but they could do this. Silently, without pointless discussion, the five Bearers fell into formation, horns alight. It might “only” be Cadance, but Mi Amore Cadenza was still an alicorn princess. They would have to strike hard and fast to end this without collateral damage.</p><p class="double">Cadance halted in mid-air, eyes widening. “Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake!” she shouted desperately.</p><p class="double">“Clap your hooves and do a little shake,” Twilight finished automatically, letting her spell wither away uncast. “You&#039;re looping?”</p><p class="double">Cadance nodded, drawing closer with a hesitant beat of her wings. “Yes.” She looked around. “Shining Armor?” she asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I don&#039;t know,” she said. Her pre-loop self had not seen her family since her explosive magical awakening on the auction block at the Royal Canterlot Slave Market had attracted Princess Celestia&#039;s attention. Pinkie Pie (who had been running an underground railroad smuggling fugitive slaves to griffon territory) remembered helping her parents escape, but Shining hadn&#039;t been with them. “With any luck, we&#039;ll find him soon.”</p><p class="double">“Right,” Cadance said weakly.</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced down at the black city below. “Why...” She trailed off. Her loop memories only turned up scattered references to the Crystal Empire, and nothing on the current situation.</p><p class="double">Cadance winced. “It&#039;s a long story,” she said.</p><p class="double">A cold wind carried a shadow through the alicorns, forming a familiar figure overhead, framed by the unmarred moon. Ethereal, black wings large enough to serve a small dragon beat slowly, and Sombra&#039;s crimson eyes glared down at the six mares, green fires burning around them. “What is this?” he demanded. “Wife?”</p><p class="double">“Wife?” Applejack echoed disbelievingly. Cadance nodded weakly, her mouth twisted into a grimace.</p><p class="double">“...I&#039;m sorry, Cadance,” Pinkie Pie said after a moment. “I don&#039;t think I can throw your anniversary party.”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s not going to be one,” Cadance said vehemently, shuddering. In a moment, Fluttershy had flown to her side, laying a comforting hoof on her side.</p><p class="double">“All right, girls,” Twilight said. “We can do this, no problem. All together.”</p><p class="double">Sombra looked confused – but not even a little hurt – when Cadance joined the other alicorns&#039; formation instead of taking his side, but then he shook his head. “I have no idea what is going on, little mares, but this is sheer foolishness. Even with six of you, I am still SOMBRA. I am second only to Celestia herself in magic, and all the power of my slaves is mine to wield.” A ball of darkness and green fire formed above his horn. “And if that is not enough to end your foolish hope, my treacherous wife should have warned you that I still hold this!” The globe of black flared, and when it receded it cradled a small object.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash let out a snort of laughter. Twilight shook her head, smiling slightly.</p><p class="double">Sombra just stared in disbelief at the heart-shaped hunk of stone that floated in his magic aura. It was elegantly carved, a perfect replica of the Crystal Heart... but still only a replica.</p><p class="double">“Were you looking for this, master?” a new voice asked.</p><p class="double">“Rarity!” Cadance cried in relief as the white alicorn rose up from the city below, the real Crystal Heart held in her own magic.</p><p class="double">“You were just waiting for the right moment, weren&#039;t you?” Applejack commented. “Drama queen.”</p><p class="double">“Guilty,” Rarity allowed cheerfully. “Cadance, darling,” she said as she floated the Heart over to her, “we simply must come up with a system to tell each other when we&#039;re looping. The past day could have been much less stressful.”</p><p class="double">“How?!” Sombra demanded.</p><p class="double">“I wouldn&#039;t mind knowing either,” Cadance said. “It wasn&#039;t in the usual place; I checked there.”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled. “It turns out my gem-finding spell works on it,” she said, “at least when powered by Generosity.” Her necklace gleamed in the pale moonlight, and Rarity glanced at Twilight. “We could have saved ourselves a lot of stress that way too, the first time.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “But Spike would have missed his chance to save the day.” Rarity glanced around, and Twilight&#039;s smile faded. “I don&#039;t think he is born yet this loop,” she said. Celestia&#039;s School For Gifted Unicorns still existed, but only freeborn unicorns attended.</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s eyes closed for a moment, but then she nodded. “All right. Let&#039;s get this over with.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s necklace flared bright red. “Right!”</p><p class="double">Defensive spells gathered around Sombra.</p><p class="double">Cadance held the Crystal Heart high. “Crystal ponies!” she shouted, her voice echoing throughout the city. “I do now what I should have done when I first came here! The Crystal Heart is yours once more! Use the light and love you have kept alive these past thousand years to end Sombra&#039;s reign forever!”</p><p class="double">Confusion sounded throughout the city below, but within seconds the Heart began to shine, piercing Nightmare Moon&#039;s eternal night like a new sun.</p><p class="double">“No,” Sombra hissed, dark clouds of magic gathering to smother the Heart&#039;s light.</p><p class="double">“Now!” Twilight shouted, and the Elements of Harmony flared with a multicolored light of their own. With practiced ease, Twilight directed their power, sending twisting beams of rainbow light into the Crystal Heart.</p><p class="double">For several moments, even the alicorns were blinded by the brilliant glare of the magic they had summoned.</p><p class="double">Below, the Crystal Empire was transformed, the dark and twisted spires becoming the glorious shining city that they had been long ago, before Sombra.</p><p class="double">The dark king screamed defiance as the light consumed him. A great shadow persisted for an instant, but then scattered, dissolving to shreds and then nothing, leaving behind only a wailing, onyx crystal pony foal that slowly drifted to the ground in a cradle of soft magic.</p><p class="double">Bands of rainbow light arced through the dark night sky, the magic of Harmony racing down ley lines to the far corners of an Equestria that had never known its touch, and as it passed overhead every last slave brand shattered.</p><p class="double">After a moment’s silent consultation with her friends, Twilight sent a message along, a plea to sound in the heart of every pony that would listen. “Cast off your chains, but shed no blood. Earth Pony, Unicorn, or Pegasus... former slave or former master... we are all ponies. We can be better than this.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Celestia and Nightmare Moon – apparently allied, a first for their non-looping selves – met the looping alicorns on a tall, bare hill several miles outside of Canterlot.</p><p class="double">They didn&#039;t bring an army, but a scrying spell had shown Twilight that Celestia didn&#039;t have much of one anymore to bring. The slave troopers had simply left, and the rest of the guard was barricaded in their barracks. An expectant quiet had fallen over Canterlot – over all of Equestria. The sun had still not risen – a limit to how far Nightmare Moon was willing to compromise, no doubt – and the rainbow waves had dimmed only slightly, still visible to the magically unaided eye.</p><p class="double">Everypony that lived knew that their world was changing forever, and they waited to see what it was changing into.</p><p class="double">Neither Celestia nor the corrupt Luna were foolish enough to think that their first blow would end the fight, but the twin beams of brilliant solar fire and cold moonlight scattered their foes&#039; formation and briefly suppressed their defenses. A powerful gravity spell forced the loopers to the ground before the two larger alicorns.</p><p class="double">There was silence for a long moment as the opponents studied each other. It was Twilight&#039;s first time seeing this loop&#039;s Celestia with Awake eyes, and it hurt that she could see no difference from the mentor she loved so much.</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Sun&#039;s eyes were hard, and though they widened slightly in surprise when they passed over Cadance, it was only when they met Twilight&#039;s gaze that she spoke. “Why, Twilight?” she asked, and the honest pain and confusion in her voice made Twilight shake. “Wasn&#039;t I a kind mistress? I raised you like my own daughter, taught you magic and gave you any comfort you asked for. Why this rebellion?”</p><p class="double">The questions hurt all the more because they showed how far this Celestia truly was from the real one. “If you even have to ask,” Twilight said, still shaking slightly, “I don&#039;t think you&#039;d understand the answer.” Her friends were at her side in an instant, lending comfort as they pressed against her.</p><p class="double">“Surrender now,” Cadance said, taking over. She held the Crystal Heart in her magic, and its glow still lived, beating in time to the prayers of the crystal ponies they&#039;d left behind in the distant north. She grew to the full stature she&#039;d earned over the countless years of looping, easily the match of Celestia or Luna. Her mane glowed in the dark night, moving in an unseen wind. “We are many, you are few, and my friends bear the most powerful magic known to ponykind.” Celestia and Luna&#039;s eyes darted to the necklaces and Twilight&#039;s tiara, but showed no recognition. “Trust me,” Cadance continued, “when I say that the weight of age and experience is on our side as well. You cannot win this battle.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon laughed, her starry mane waving wildly around her. “And thou called me insane, sister?” she asked. “Enough. Let us put an end these upstart fillies and be done with this madness so my reign may begin.”</p><p class="double">Celestia took a deep breath. “Yes,” she said softly. “But... please, if we can, let us spare Twilight Sparkle&#039;s life.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon snorted, but she nodded. “Very well.” Her eyes swept Twilight and her friends. “This is your last chance, little ponies, before you learn why my legend survived a thousand years.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash snickered. “It&#039;s almost cute how you think you&#039;re more awesome than us.” She shook her head. “Are you ready, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“No,” Twilight said, “but that doesn&#039;t matter. Let&#039;s just finish this.”</p><p class="double">Celestia and her sister – even in her corrupted form – were ancient, powerful in both body and magic, and the veterans of countless battles. The mightiest dragons feared their wrath, and the heavens themselves moved or stilled at their command.</p><p class="double">The battle lasted some time, but the royal sisters never had a chance. When it was done, Equestia had a brief moment to see two alicorn heads facing each other across the moon before Twilight Sparkle set it and summoned forth the delayed dawn.</p><p><hr></p><p>The signature at the bottom of the letter that had come to Canterlot was enough to determine which of the Seven Harmonious Princesses would go to negotiate with the leaders of this particular band of escaped slaves wishing to return to Equestria.</p><p class="double">Twilight and Cadance teleported to the meeting site, on the edge of the vast southern badlands, almost an hour early. That was maybe a mistake, because Cadance&#039;s impatience was unbearable, but soon enough Twilight spied a dragon flying toward them.</p><p class="double">Cadance&#039;s horn lit, but a wave from Twilight stilled it. A vision magnification spell revealed two ponies safely carried in the crimson dragon&#039;s claw. (Twilight was fairly sure this was the same dragon that normally had to be discouraged from napping in the mountain above Ponyville. That was no doubt going to be an interesting story.)</p><p class="double">Shortly, the dragon landed a small distance away, and lowered his claw to deposit his passengers before taking wing once more. While he circled overhead, the two ponies approached Twilight and Cadance. Twilight recognized one of them.</p><p class="double">“Twily?” Shining Armor asked in disbelief, mouth hanging open as he stared at her and neatly answered the question of whether he was looping. “Is that... is that really you?”</p><p class="double">Beside Twilight, Cadance was frowning at Shining&#039;s companion, but Twilight only had eyes for her brother. He was thin, and heavily scarred, but otherwise healthy, she concluded in relief. “Yes,” she confirmed. “I&#039;m your sister, Shining.”</p><p class="double">“...how?” Shining asked in disbelief.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a long story,” Twilight said, and she took a step forward.</p><p class="double">That broke Shining&#039;s restraint, and he galloped forward, meeting Twilight in an embrace. “I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d ever see you again,” he murmured into her side, choking back tears. “I hated that I couldn&#039;t protect you that day.”</p><p class="double">“I know,” Twilight whispered, wrapping her wings around her brother. “It&#039;s all right. It&#039;s all over now. We&#039;re together again.”</p><p class="double">After a long moment Shining wormed out of Twilight&#039;s grasp and sat back on his rear, legs shaking. “Our parents?” he asked, clearly fearing the answer.</p><p class="double">“Safe, in Canterlot,” Twilight was glad to say.</p><p class="double">Shining stared up at her, disbelief warring with relief in his eyes. Then he laughed suddenly. “It&#039;s weird that you&#039;re taller than me, Twily,” he said.</p><p class="double">“And the wings?” Twilight asked, smiling.</p><p class="double">“And the wings,” Shining Armor agreed.</p><p class="double">His companion chuckled, drawing Twilight&#039;s attention. Cadance was still staring at her, Twilight realized, and she took a moment to study the mare herself. She was a pink unicorn with bright green eyes and a dark mane, and her cutie mark was... a cocoon? Twilight started in realization.</p><p class="double">“Ah, let me introduce you,” Shining said, standing. “Twily, this is my wife, Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">“The changeling queen?” Cadance asked in a strangled voice, breaking her silence.</p><p class="double">The pink unicorn started. “You know?!” she exclaimed. Then she shook her head. “I guess I shouldn&#039;t be surprised you can see through my magic, though, since you beat Celestia.” There was a flare of green, and Chrysalis&#039;s true form replaced the unicorn. She was much smaller than normal, though, around the same size as Shining. A part of Twilight wondered if that was choice or malnutrition due to true love being harder to find in this loop, but she was more interested in her brother&#039;s reaction.</p><p class="double">He didn&#039;t show any surprise, shaking his head as he walked over to the changeling and kissed her on the cheek. “I&#039;d hoped to break that piece of news a little more gently,” he commented. As much as that, it was probably the adoring look in Chrysalis&#039;s eyes as she smiled at Shining that made Cadance shudder. “...is your friend okay, Twily?” Shining asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight teleported to Cadance&#039;s side. “Deep breaths,” she whispered harshly. “Deep breaths, Cadance. Remember, he&#039;s never met you and that isn&#039;t her. I don&#039;t want to have to send you to the moon too.”</p><p class="double">Cadance shuddered again, but that was all she did, at least.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s long experience with countless bizarre loops granted Twilight a certain equanimity. Her brother being deeply in love with – an apparently equally besotted and hopefully much nicer – Queen Chrysalis was far from the worst craziness she&#039;d endured. Soon enough, it would just be another funny story to tell the looping Shining Armor the next time they met up.</p><p class="double">...the hard part was going to be convincing Cadance to see it that way.</p><p><hr></p><p>24.5</p><p class="double">“The parliament calls on the honourable member of the Life Seat of Diamonds, Rarity of Ponyville.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Speaker.” Rarity stepped up to the podium. “Honourable mares and stallions, I have only recently taken my position as a member of this august body, and hope to learn more than I already do about the running of our fine country. But with regard to the current topic under debate, I feel I must make my voice heard.”</p><p class="double">Several ponies who had sat back at the first sentence perked their ears up again. Maybe this wouldn’t be a bit of on-the-record blather.</p><p class="double">“We must first recall that, in a past that is not so very long ago by the standards of the proud race of dragons, we were not the united country of which we think today when the name Equestria is spoken.”</p><p class="double">Rarity’s voice softened, but could still be heard throughout the room. “Equestria. An idea, one founded on a simple concept – let none be turned away. It is for that very reason that our parliament itself is made up the way it is.”</p><p class="double">A pause, then in a dry tone: “But I assume you already know that.”</p><p class="double">There were chuckles.</p><p class="double">“It is true, perhaps, that when Equestria was founded those ponies in long-past days thought only of ponies. It should not surprise us – encountering others was rare. But that assumption has been cast aside many times in the past. Are not the deer of White Tail Woods given rights equal to any other citizen, should they chose to exercise them? They are indeed. And the same for the donkeys, the cows, the sheep… all those who live freely within our borders, a small but unique and treasured part of what makes Equestria.”</p><p class="double">Some of the members arrested movement that would have seen them turn to look at various other MPs. Such as the sole deer amongst them, a middle-aged hind from the area of White Tail Woods, for example…</p><p class="double">Something inside Rarity was singing as she kept going. “Yes, Equestria is a land where all are welcome, as it should be. In this light, I propose that our reaction to the discovery of a new race beyond our borders should not be to gird ourselves for the threat of war, nor to ignore the issue and hope it goes away. No, I propose that our response – one to be sent as soon as time allows – is to empower an ambassador and open up normalized relations with these new acquaintances.”</p><p class="double">Her voice had risen with that last few lines, and she brought it back under control. “Perhaps I’m a little inexperienced, as I said. But I cannot help but remember the results of applying diplomacy in other recent crises this country has faced. Like Nightmare Moon and Discord, let our approach to Queen Chrysalis show that Equestria does not shy from acting decisively, and let our decision be one of quick and generous negotiation.”</p><p class="double">By mentioning those two threats, she was deliberately reminding the assembled chamber that she was directly involved in saving Equestria twice – and in both cases redeeming the hostile magical creature.</p><p class="double">“That is all I have to say. I would only add, as a closing remark, that Equestria has traditionally destroyed her enemies – but not by destroying them, merely what makes them an enemy. It is how we have gained our fastest friends.”</p><p class="double">Going over it in her head, Rarity didn’t think it was all that much of a speech… it was a lot harder to make one up on the fly than it sounded. But it got a lot of applause anyway, so maybe she was onto something.</p><p class="double">A political career wasn’t something she’d do every loop, not by a long chalk, but it was certainly different. </p><p><hr></p><p>24.6 (Koolerkid)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had Awakened in a lot of strange places. In the ocean, in space, on the moon, in a sewer... she also had a tendency to Awake mid-stride, which was really annoying because even after an uncountable number of loops, she still nearly tripped almost every time. She found that the place you Awaken in can actually tell you quite a lot about the loop you’re in, though it wasn’t perfect. If she woke up reading the familiar book of prophecy, for example, she could expect that loop to be somewhat close to her base loop.</p><p class="double">So when Twilight Awoke curled up in a dark corner of a dirty, dingy hovel with an equally dirty, dingy human girl staring at her, Twilight decided that this was going to be a depressing loop.</p><p class="double">She was a human here, dressed in rags every bit as filthy and stained with ash and soot as everything else. Checking her loop memories, Twilight learned her name here was Twila, and that she was a runaway slave, or skaa. As a girl, her options were limited, so she and the girl she’d escaped with, named Vin, had become thieves. Vin was the girl across from her now; her brother had taught them the trade before abandoning them, as he’d continuously warned he would. They weren’t exactly friends - Vin was too paranoid and pre-loop Twila was too cautious - but they were allies, at least.</p><p class="double">Seeing her eyes open, Vin gave her a searching look. “New looper?”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a relieved sigh and nodded. “Twilight Sparkle, of Equestria. Are you the local Anchor?”</p><p class="double">Vin nodded, and leaned back. “Yup. Welcome to Scadrial, the butt of the multiverse. Where the skies are a brilliant shade of ash black, the trees are brown, the people are either sheep or pigs, and our ruler is an immortal asshole.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced at that. “That bad, huh?”</p><p class="double">Vin reached into her subspace pocket and pulled out a slim brown book, handing it to Twilight. “See for yourself. I’m not much for books, but Elend thought making a summary of the way things work here would speed things up a bit. Just read fast; we don’t have long before Camon shows up to drag us away on his idiot suicide mission, and I don’t want to leave before I know what we’re doing this loop.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded eagerly and snatched up the book. “Don’t worry, I’m a fast reader.” She opened the book, and sped her way through the pages. As she read, her eager smile dissipated into a frown. Rashek, the Lord Ruler, reminded her uncomfortably of some of the more unstable versions of Celestia she’d encountered throughout the loops. He was an impossibly powerful immortal who saved the world once, long ago, and preformed a vital function to protect the world from further harm. He was also dangerously unstable, driven mad by age, power, and the influence of a mad god. Twilight decided, as she finished the book, to try and save him. And she knew just how to do it, too.</p><p class="double">“Do you think you can get me to the Well of Ascension?” she asked. The Well was the only source of power the book mentioned that was great enough for her purposes. “I have a plan, but I’ll need the Well to make something, first.”</p><p class="double">Vin raised an eyebrow, but shrugged. “I guess so. Raiding Kredik Shaw is always good for a laugh. Can’t open the Well myself, though. Think you might be an Allomancer?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned a little. “Probably. Allomancy is basically magic, and I’m very good at magic.”</p><p class="double">Vin nodded. “Okay, good. Otherwise, we’d have to get Elend or Kell, assuming they’re even Awake this loop, and they’re not the... stealthiest guys around. Well, maybe Kell, but he tends to leave a trail of dead bodies.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered at this, then shook her head. “Well, no need for that. Give me a week to learn Allomancy, and we’ll go to the Well.”</p><p class="double">“A week?” Vin seemed skeptical. “Confident, are we?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “You’d be surprised...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vin stared, open-mouthed, as Twilight effortlessly Pushed several hundred pounds of iron above her head, burning only steel and a bit of pewter to brace herself. “You were right. I am surprised.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “And it only took me three days! This is easier then I thought!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A few days and one stealth mission later, Vin watched in bemusement as Twilight climbed form the Well of Ascension, wearing the strange tiara she’d gone in with and carrying what looked like... “You’re kidding. You used up the source of near-omnipotent power to create a couple necklaces?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned at her. “These aren’t just necklaces - they’re fully-functional replicas of the Elements of Harmony, some of the most powerful magical artifacts from my home loop. I only had my Element of Magic with me, of course, but I was able to invoke the spirits of the other Elements to make copies. I doubt they’d hold up past one use, but it’s enough for our purposes.” She held out one of the necklaces, emblazoned with a small, red thunderbolt. “Here, I figure Loyalty suits you. Now we’ll just need four other people to represent a few abstract concepts, and a clear shot at the Lord Ruler - and maybe some of the Steel Inquisitors, if we can manage it.”</p><p class="double">Vin looked down at the necklaces, before shrugging and putting it on. “I do like red. These are weapons?”</p><p class="double">“Not exactly, no. But they’ll defeat the Lord Ruler, and, through the connection between the hemalurgy spikes on him and the Inquisitors, probably Ruin too.”</p><p class="double">“Two birds, one stone.” Vin smiled. “I like it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Elend fingered the necklace bearing a purple diamond he wore nervously. “Vin, are you sure about this? I just don’t see how some jewelry is going to stop the Lord Ruler, much less Ruin.” He, Vin, and Twilight were huddled in the corner of a hut, on the very edge of the town square, where the Lord Ruler was scheduled to make an appearance. Vin had been overjoyed to see her husband was Awake; it was the most emotion Twilight had seen her display to date.</p><p class="double">Vin just shrugged. “Twilight seems to think so. And if it doesn’t, it’s not like we don’t know how to kill him, or the Inquisitors. Might as well give it a shot.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled warmly at her fellow Anchor. “Thanks, Vin.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, you three!” Kelsier’s grinning face made an appearance from the entrance to the roof, the blue ballon on his own necklace glimmering in the torchlight. “Come on, it’s almost time. To Vin’s mild disappointment, Kell had not been awake, but he’d leapt at the chance to add a pair of powerful Skaa Mistborn like Twilight and Vin to his team. Elend had taken more convincing, being a nobleman, but Elend had apparently kept the extreme Allomantic powers he normally wouldn’t have gotten until much later, and his raw power convinced even the most stubbornly anti-noble member of the crew.</p><p class="double">As the trio trooped up to the roof, they joined the rest of Kelsier’s merry gang. There was Ham, a simple sort of man with a philosophical bent that Twilight found rather intriguing; they had had many lengthy discussions on various topics. Next to him was Breeze, who greatly reminded Twilight of a sort of odd fusion between Rarity’s high class and Rainbow Dash’s superior attitude. There was Dox, who avoided Vin and Twilight studiously - Twilight was certain it was because of their close association with Elend. And finally, the last two members of Twilight’s impromptu Element Bearers - scholarly Sazed, whom Twilight had been most impressed with and given the Element of Honesty, and gentle Spook, who had recieved Kindness.</p><p class="double">Dox eyed the group warily as the six Bearers assembled themselves on the edge of the roof. “I still don’t believe those trinkets will do anything,” he muttered.</p><p class="double">Kelsier just grinned at him. “What have we got to lose? Twila says these things can defeat the Lord Ruler; I say, let’s give it a shot! After all, nobody knows any other way to kill him, do they?”</p><p class="double">“Shhh!” Spook hissed, pointing, but he needn’t have bothered. Twilight could feel the Lord Ruler coming, like a heavy weight on her soul. She shivered; the dark feeling reminded her of the effects of the Dementors from her Hogwarts loops. As if she’d never be happy again. Vin hadn’t been exaggerating.</p><p class="double">She and the other three Mistborn in the group all put up Copperclouds and began Rioting the emotions of the group, just as planned, and the feeling of dread dissipated.</p><p class="double">Twilight watched carefully as a black carriage came up to the square, and the Lord Ruler stepped out. The carriage was followed by several of the abominations Vin called Steel Inquisitors, and just looking at them made Twilight feel sick. She didn’t even want to think about all the people who died to create the spikes that stuck out from their eyes, and the smaller, hidden ones on their backs. Hemalurgy was a dark magic indeed.</p><p class="double">Kelsier put a hand on Twilight’s shoulder. “Whatever it is these baubles do,” he said quietly, “you’ll never get a better shot.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and concentrated on her Element. As she hoped, the other five Elements responded, and they all began to glow. The Lord Ruler, his sense sharpened by years of burning Tin, noticed the glow and shouted something, but before his Inquisitors could spring into action, a rainbow light exploded from the Elements. It spread out, covering first Luthadel, then the Empire, and eventually all of Scadrial.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Some time later, Vin looked down at the sobbing Rashek. “What did you do to him?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “All the evil and madness has been purged from him. I imagine he’s probably overwhelmed with guilt and shame.”</p><p class="double">“Nice.” Vin grinned. “And them?” She gestured to the fallen Steel Inquisitors.</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “They were mostly dead already; just a scrap of soul bound to a body with Hemalurgy and Ruin’s power. The Elements freed all the souls trapped in the Hemalurgic spikes, and without that power... well, people don’t generally survive having giant spikes in the place of eyes.”</p><p class="double">“Ouch.” Vin laughed. “And Ruin?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled a bit. “Going by the other pure evil deities we’ve used them on, probably imprisoned in something even sturdier then Preservation’s prison. He has no more power on this world.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent. Last question.” Vin gestured around at the clear blue skies, bright yellow sun, and green grass. “How the hell did you manage all this?”</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “The environment had been artificially altered. The Elements are pretty good at normalizing that kind of thing.”</p><p class="double">Vin shook her head. “You’re a miracle worker, Twilight Sparkle. It normally takes me at least a year to fix this, and I usually have to turn into a god to do it.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’m already a god. Sort of. We use the term divine, at least…”</p><p class="double">“Wait, what?”</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>25.1</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “Huh. I would appear to be… Twilight the False Bearded.”</p><p class="double">It seemed that in this universe the fabled old wizard was actually a mare – her, in fact. But… <i>she</i> was pretending to be a stallion for some unknown reason.</p><p class="double">Well, it wasn’t important… probably. Twilight discarded the beard and, after a moment of deliberation, decided to keep the hat and robe.</p><p class="double">“Right, I wonder if-”</p><p class="double">Something barrelled through the door and threw forelegs around her. “Hi, Momma!”</p><p class="double">“Nyx?” Twilight said, delighted. “How come you’re-”</p><p class="double">Luna entered the room. That jogged Twilight’s Loop memory, and she made an <i>ah</i> of realization. “So, the Royal Sisters are twins this time.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Luna nodded to her solemnly. “Strange, but it gives me a good opportunity to really get to know my…”</p><p class="double">She paused. “Now that I think about it, a permanent descriptor for Nyx’s relationship to me is a rather tricky question. I mean, I can scarcely call <i>her</i> a dark side.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Nyx giggled.</p><p class="double">“I am darker in colour, though…” the youngest Looper there said critically. “I mean, there’s not a lot in it…”</p><p class="double">Luna appeared to come to a decision. “I shall simply call you <i>sister</i>, dear Nyx. And I would be honoured to continue to call you that, no matter the whys and whens of the loop.”</p><p class="double">Nyx beamed.</p><p class="double">“Now,” the elder Lunar Princess added, “how shall we divide the duties?”</p><p class="double">“I know!” Nyx’s horn lit, and created an illusion of the moon-sun system relative to them. “I get the new moons, you get the full moons. That fair?”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good,” Luna nodded. “What about the daytimes?”</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. “Of <i>course</i> you’re going to want me to do it.”</p><p class="double">“Now you mention it…” Nyx said teasingly, “that <i>would</i> help.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Er… Day Regent?”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up. “Yes?”</p><p class="double">“I was wondering… I know it’s impolite, but…” the elderly noble shook his head. “How old are you?”</p><p class="double">“What makes you ask?” Twilight replied. “And it <i>is</i> rude to ask a mare’s age.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I remember when, as a young colt, my father took me into Canterlot for the first time, and he mentioned that you’d been a rock of stability for the country for as long as he could remember.” The stallion seemed very confused. “And here you are, the same as you were on that day.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I understand your confusion,” Twilight said earnestly. “Assisting with the court is something of a family tradition.”</p><p class="double">“…right. Sorry for getting you mixed up with your mother.” The noble walked off, satisfied.</p><p class="double"><i>I wonder if he’ll ever work out that those two sentences I said, while both true, weren’t actually otherwise related…</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.2 (Anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia and Nightmare Moon – apparently allied – met the looping alicorns on a tall, bare hill several miles outside of Canterlot.</p><p class="double">They didn&#039;t bring an army, but a scrying spell had shown Twilight that it wasn&#039;t for lacking the option. The royal guard – even a torn Shining Armor – had begged Princess Celestia to let them help. Celestia had been forced to refuse them, of course; against seven enemy alicorn princesses an army was likely to be only a fleeting distraction.</p><p class="double">An expectant quiet had fallen over Canterlot – over all of Equestria. The sun had still not risen – a limit to how far Nightmare Moon was willing to compromise, no doubt – and the rainbow waves had dimmed only slightly, still visible to the magically unaided eye.</p><p class="double">Everypony that lived knew that their world was changing forever, and they waited to see what it was changing into.</p><p class="double">Neither Celestia nor the corrupt Luna were foolish enough to think that their first blow would end the fight, but the twin beams of brilliant solar fire and cold moonlight scattered their foes&#039; formation and briefly suppressed their defenses. A powerful gravity spell forced the loopers to the ground before the two larger alicorns.</p><p class="double">There was silence for a long moment as the opponents studied each other. It was Twilight&#039;s first time seeing this loop&#039;s Celestia with Awake eyes, and it <i>hurt</i> to see the pain and confusion in her gaze.</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eyes widened in surprise as they passed over Cadance, blinking back unshed tears, but it was only when they met Twilight&#039;s gaze that she spoke. “<i>Why</i>, Twilight?” she asked, and despite it all the betrayed agony in her voice made Twilight shake. “What did I do wrong? Was I too harsh a teacher? Should I not have hidden the truth about Nightmare Moon from you? <i>Why?</i>”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie seemed to be within seconds of vibrating into a thousand pieces from impatience, so Twilight nodded at her. “All right, do it now,” she said.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Pinkie exclaimed, and her horn glowed a brilliant pink as she teleported all the ponies who had been “killed” in their attack on Ponyville to the battle site from the Palace of the Royal Pony Sisters, where a bemused Looping Mayor Mare had been explaining the plan and overseeing the preparations.</p><p class="double">“SURPRISE!” came from a hundred throats – though in nothing close to unison. The plan had been for them to get a ten second countdown, but Pinkie skipping that wasn&#039;t really a shock.</p><p class="double">The “Welcome Back Princess Lu-” banner really <i>shouldn&#039;t </i>have been either, but Twilight still planted a hoof in her face when she saw it. At least she hadn&#039;t pushed it and tried to get them to make a “Congratulations On Reconciling” sign. Harmony only knew how that would have been spelled.</p><p class="double">Celestia sat back, her mouth gaping open.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon laughed, her starry mane waving wildly around her. “<b>And thou called <i>me</i> insane, sister?</b>” she asked.</p><p class="double">“But... wha...” Celestia sputtered helplessly.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon shook her head, still chortling. “<b>They got u</b>s, &#039;Tia,” she said, blotches of black corruption running down her side and melting away. “Is it not clear?” Luna asked, apparently not even noticing her transformation reverting. “No doubt the entire intent of this rebellion was to force us to fight alongside each other once more.”</p><p class="double">Celestia certainly <i>did </i>notice though. “...Luna?”</p><p class="double">The younger princess was still snickering. “It is most obvious that this Twilight Sparkle is <i>thy </i>student, &#039;Tia.”</p><p class="double">Celestia glanced at Twilight, and though the Princess of the Sun was still clearly confused, Twilight was relieved to see gratitude in her eyes. Then Celestia jumped up, almost bowling her sister over in the force of her embrace.</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. Though it was a little painful to apply anything learned from that distasteful loop to others, it had only held to reason that if sudden, massive rebellion by seven alicorns was enough to force Nightmare Moon and that slave-owning Celestia to reconcile on their own, it would also work on more a more ordinary version of her also.</p><p class="double">Luna had finally taken stock of herself and the situation, and started returning her Celestia&#039;s hug, both sisters sobbing wildly. Twilight&#039;s smile widened a little. She and her friends would have a lot of explanations and apologies to make, but it was worth it, really.</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced up at the unmarred moon and, deciding that the royal sisters were likely to be distracted for a while, quietly set it and brought forth the delayed dawn before joining the celebration. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">Academic Excellence continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As she approached the Flight Assignment board, she saw Cloud Chaser and Wildflower coming away with affronted expressions, which went flat as they saw her approach.</p><p class="double">“What’s up guys? I figured you’d be able to team up with any-pony else, that’s why we cross-trained.”</p><p class="double">“It’s not us!” Cloud Chaser exclaimed, “You were robbed!”</p><p class="double">“Yes, they made you a wing-pony!” Wildflower said indignantly. “I managed to get a look at the Hall of Fame. That run you pulled yesterday was the fastest ever!”</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged. “I know. So who did I get as Lead?”</p><p class="double">“Who else…” Cloud Chaser growled.</p><p class="double">“They made me lead pony!” Lightning Dust’s voice held a hint of smugness. “And they made us a team, that’s what you wanted, isn’t it? Working together and all that.”</p><p class="double">Dash turned to face her with a grin. “Yeah, that’s exactly what I wanted.”</p><p class="double">That seemed to take some of the enjoyment out of Lightning Dust’s expression. “I’ll see you out on the tarmac, wing-pony.”</p><p class="double">She stalked off, to Dash’s called response. “Hey, since we’re partners now, we should get some breakfast together…”</p><p class="double">She found the other Ponyville ponies had clustered around her, most with similar expressions of displeasure. Thunderlane had a face like his namesake. “Why aren’t you going to Spitfire’s office and asking what in the wide, wide world of Equestria she was thinking! That pony couldn’t lead a sing-song, let alone a team!”</p><p class="double">“Why would Spitfire snub you like this? I thought she liked you!” Milky Way asked.</p><p class="double">“That would be one excellent reason to be harder on me than any-pony else. Playing favourites is one of the fastest ways to breed resentment and break discipline. Besides, I know what she’s doing, or I can guess at least. I guessed she’d put us together, we’re the two strongest fliers, but there’s another reason. Spitfire has to have spotted the potential problems with Dusty, they don’t exactly pick Wonderbolt Commanders out of a hat, and she wants some-pony who can cope with her teamed up with her.”</p><p class="double">“Then why not as Lead pony?” Thunderlane asked. “Then you could tell her to shape up and she’d have to.”</p><p class="double">“Ha, like that would work! All that would do would be to make her even more resentful. She’d have to take my orders or quit, but she’d ultimately get so eager to show she’s better than me that she’d pull some stupid stunt that would earn her a crash-landing. Trust me, I know show-offs. I was one… okay I still am one, but I’ve learned that there’s more to life than that. Lightning Dust hasn’t. As her wing-pony, I can advise, suggest, and hopefully get her to see the advantages of working together.”</p><p class="double">Thunderlane still seemed unconvinced. “You and Spitfire are going to a lot of trouble to salvage her. I thought you said something about not playing favourites?“</p><p class="double">“Not quite the same thing. I’d like to think that Spitfire or I would make the same effort for any-pony, one of you guys if you were the problem foal. She has the potential to go all the way, and it would be a crying shame if she failed because she failed to understand the rest of what she needs.”</p><p class="double">Raindrops was looking at her with a degree of wonder. “Dash, when did you get so… wise.”</p><p class="double">“Heh, if this is wisdom, I want my money back!” The rainbow maned pegasus grinned. “Seriously, I hang around with a group of very smart ponies. There’s Twilight, the certified egg-head who’s about the cleverest pony I know, she even got me reading! Applejack has the market cornered on down home common-sense, while I reckon Pinkie is just as smart as Twilight, but at right angles to reality. Fluttershy is Miss Empathy and Rarity is as skilled at shmoozing as any-pony in Canterlot.”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “You can’t be friends with that bunch and not pick up a few things. I needed more than just awesome flying skills to keep up with them, and you know I never turn down a challenge, or let some-pony down.”</p><p class="double">Cloud Chaser gave her a friendly pat on the back with one wing. “Well, good luck, I guess. You’re going to need it!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Snowflake agreed.</p><p class="double">As the group broke up, Manerick, who had been observing things from behind a newspaper and a coffee (it was a big coffee) finished the mug and headed off to report what had happened to Spitfire. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The teams formed up out on the main runway, Milky Way and Wildflower exchanging small talk, while Snowflake stood at attention watched with a slight smirk by Cloud Chaser, and Raindrops stretched out her wings next to her partner Thunderlane.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust had her Lead pony badge in her hoof and was examining it proudly as Dash came up beside her. Her eyes fell to the silver badge Rainbow wore. “Mine is gold!”</p><p class="double">“I know, it’s a big honour, right?” Rainbow replied easily.</p><p class="double">“Huh, I’d have expected you to kick up a bigger fuss about not getting one of these yourself!” The green pegasus stated, trying to get a rise out of Dash.</p><p class="double">“It would have been nice, but you have to figure Spitfire knows what she’s doing. She knows I can lead from when she came to observe Ponyville’s water delivery to Cloudsdale, she probably wants to see if I still remember how to follow. Which I do, I’ve been lead weather-pony for Ponyville for a couple of years now, but I paid my dues to get there.”</p><p class="double">“Huh, weather work, that’s kinda dull. I’m a high speed courier, anywhere, anytime I deliver!”</p><p class="double">“That makes sense, you’d need self-reliance, guts and speed to do that job well. But weather work isn’t all clear flying, at least not in Ponyville. We’re right up against the Everfree Forest, or as we weather pegasi call it ‘Princess Celestia’s Home for Clinically Insane Weather.’ Seriously, you never know what’s going to come out next. At one point we had rains of fish so regularly that we had a thriving canning industry!”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust gave her a look askance. “Yeah, right…”</p><p class="double">The rainbow-maned pegasus held her serious expression for another couple of heart-beats, then cracked up. “Okay, you got me… but I mean it about weird weather. You should come over some time, what with that and Ghastly Gorge, there’s plenty of challenging flying.”</p><p class="double">“Heh, I might just do that.” Lightning Dust replied, “You know Dash, you’re alright.”</p><p class="double">Dash preened. “I’m better than alright, I’m awesome, which I guess makes two of us.”</p><p class="double">“You ain’t just shovelling stratus!” The other pegasus grinned.</p><p class="double">Spitfire and her assistants arrived at that point, putting an end to the conversation.</p><p class="double">“Today you will all be participating in a flag hunt. We&#039;ll divide you into two teams, red... and blue.” As she stated the colours, her assistants appeared behind the groups, one holding a red flag, the other the blue. Lightning Dust and Rainbow were partnered with Thunderlane and Raindrops. Dash had neatly stepped forward and avoided being pushed aside by the pony holding the flag.</p><p class="double">“Whoever finds the most flags of the opposing team&#039;s colour wins.”</p><p class="double">All the recruits cheered, but the ones trained by Dash knew better then to start talking in the ranks. Lightning Dust didn&#039;t. “Aw yeah! We&#039;re going to rock this so hard...”</p><p class="double">She got a face full of Spitfire for her pains. “This isn&#039;t some sort of game, it&#039;s a training exercise! Lead ponies and wing-ponies must fly together. If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified. Do you understand?”</p><p class="double">“Yes ma&#039;am!” They chorused. At the whistle, they all took off, and the red team forming up and agreeing on something. Then they formed a line abreast and started doing systematic sweeps of the area, exactly the way Dash had taught them, straight from the Wonderbolts own play-book on search and rescue techniques.</p><p class="double">The blue team had more difficulty. “If we have to keep our speed down to those guys, we&#039;ll never get anywhere!”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re not that slow!” Thunderlane retorted, glaring at Lightning Dust.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash tried spreading stratus on turbulent air. “Sweeping as a line lets us cover more ground and not end up checking somewhere the other wing pair already did. We should stick with the Thuderlane and Raindrops.”</p><p class="double">“If we can sweep the whole place in half the time, why do we need any-pony else?” Lightning Dust exclaimed. “C&#039;mon Dash, let&#039;s go!”</p><p class="double">Dash gave an apologetic glance to the other half of blue team, and a &#039;Do your best without us!&#039; before zooming off after her lead pony. She came up alongside Lightning and said, “I don&#039;t think this is going to work as well as you think, but you&#039;ve got lead. How do you want to do this?”</p><p class="double">“Just follow me and keep looking for those flags, we&#039;ll have the whole lot before they can blink!”</p><p class="double">She started flying hither and yon in a pretty much random pattern at great speed. Dash could have helped make a clean sweep, as she knew the locations of every flag, red and blue after so many repeats, but she was only going to &#039;find&#039; the flags that Lightning Dust&#039;s random pattern took them over.</p><p class="double">They made an impressive haul, scooping up flag after flag as they covered a longer path than the other three pairs put together. It was a confident Lightning Dust who landed by the instructors when time was called, with Rainbow Dash in perfect formation with her.</p><p class="double">“Heh! Told you!” The green pegasus was grinning. “We must have found twice as many flags as any-pony else! Though you spotted even mopre than me, you must have X-ray vision.”</p><p class="double">“Uh huh, my super-powers are all to do with flying.” Dash bantered back. Lightning Dust had relaxed as they&#039;d flown around, and Dash had enjoyed chatting with her. She was finally starting to build up something like the connection she&#039;d unwittingly made that fist time round. However, she didn&#039;t expect the other pony&#039;s good mood to last much longer.</p><p class="double">Spitfire examined a clip-board. “After totalling up the flags, it&#039;s clear this was a close run battle. Both teams got a very high count, record breaking in fact. However, the Red team wins.”</p><p class="double">“WHAT?” Lightning Dust exclaimed. “But me and Dash got more flags than any-pony!”</p><p class="double">Spitfire removed her shades and gave Lightning Dust a severe look. “Unfortunately, the other half of your team got the least out of all the pairs. It&#039;s the total as a group that counts.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust glared at Thunderlane and got her stare returned with interest. Dash put a wing on her shoulder to calm her down before she said something she&#039;d regret, or at least that would put her in hot water with Spitfire. She whispered, “Stay frosty, it&#039;s only a test...”</p><p class="double">However, once Spitfire and her team had left Lightning Dust rounded on Thunderlane and Raindrops. “What were you two doing? Goofing off and smelling the flowers? You cost us the win!”</p><p class="double">Thunderlane exploded. “WE cost YOU the win? You and your grandstand tactics are to blame for us losing!”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re crazy!” Lightning Dust snorted. “Dash, tell him he&#039;s crazy!”</p><p class="double">“Why should I? I said your plan wouldn&#039;t work.” Dash responded.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust looked aside at her, incredulously. “Why are you turning on me? I thought we were a team! Well fine, I don&#039;t need you or any-pony!”</p><p class="double">She turned to stalk away, only to be blocked by Snowflake and Thunderlane, who growled at her. “You&#039;re an idiot! Dash is the one pony who&#039;s been supporting you from the start! The rest of us wouldn&#039;t be giving an arrogant egotist like you the time of day if she hadn&#039;t asked us to! She sees something in you, I don&#039;t know what, but then she&#039;s the real deal, a leader because she _leads_ rather than because some-pony pinned a gold badge on her!”</p><p class="double">“Thunderlane, that&#039;s enough!” Rainbow Dash interjected. “I know you&#039;re mad, I would be too, but it&#039;s as much my fault as hers. I should have done more to stop her pulling that kinda stuff.”</p><p class="double">“You don&#039;t need to make excuses for her.” Thunderlane gave a snort. “We saw you trying. She was the one who was convinced of her own infallibility. If you want to make it up to us, explain it to her, and this time use small words! Maybe if you grind them fine enough they&#039;ll filter through that layer of ego she wraps herself in.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust still wanted to leave, but the rest of the cadets had crowded round, blocking her escape routes. She didn&#039;t have much choice. She turned to Dash. “Fine, so explain already!”</p><p class="double">“If we&#039;d stayed in line with Thunderlane and Raindrops, we&#039;d probably have won. The red team did a standard search and rescue sweep pattern, right out of the Wonderbolts&#039; own Flight Operations Manual. They use a three abreast flight, but the same idea. They covered a strip four pegasi wide, and because they were in formation, they knew exactly what had been covered, and any flag one pony missed, some-pony else was likely to spot.”</p><p class="double">Dash indicated the positions with her wing tips, demonstrating what she was describing.</p><p class="double">“By going off on our own, we forced Thunderlane and Raindrops to cover twice the distance and fewer eyes meant more chance of missing a flag. Not to mention fatigue towards the end. We made up for it somewhat by finding more flags, but by flying around random-like, we covered some areas twice and missed others. Plus we picked up flags they&#039;d have gotten if we&#039;d been working together.”</p><p class="double">“You and I still got the most flags, that has to count for something!” Lightning Dust claimed, stomping a hoof. “Spitfire seems to think I&#039;ve got the right stuff, or she wouldn&#039;t have made me Lead pony.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow shook her head. “Maybe she just wanted to see how you&#039;d do as a leader. It&#039;s more than just telling ponies what to do, it&#039;s about being able to ask for ideas from your team-mates and make decisions that are best for the group, not just you. If you&#039;re as obsessed with the Wonderbolts as I am, you&#039;ll have seen all their displays. Just think, have you ever seen a stunt or performance where there was a _lone_ Wonderbolt flying?”</p><p class="double">That seemed to get through to Lightning Dust, and her annoyed expression turned worried.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s what I thought. I doubt she was too impressed with that out-burst afterwards either. She took off the glasses, that&#039;s generally a sign that some-pony&#039;s gonna get unlucky.”</p><p class="double">“How can you know that!” Dust asked finally looking nervous.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash sighed. “Any-pony here can tell you how much I want to be a Wonderbolt. I&#039;ve studied their moves, their strategies, and the ponies who fly for them. Do you really think I wouldn&#039;t find out anything I could about the pony who was in charge of the Academy for our course?”</p><p class="double">“Hey, I want to be a Wonderbolt too! I&#039;ve dreamed of it since I was a filly! Why do you think I push myself so hard in the first place?” Lightning Dust exclaimed in a hurt voice. “It&#039;s not my fault other ponies can&#039;t keep up!”</p><p class="double">“Look, I get you! I was the same way. But my friends helped me to realise, it&#039;s more than just pushing yourself, it&#039;s about pushing yourself in the right direction. A Wonderbolt has to be an expert flyer, but she also has to work with other pegasi, and that means listening to them, even accepting that you can&#039;t always be out front.” She gestured to her own silver wing pony badge. “If you can&#039;t figure that out, it doesn&#039;t matter how awesome your moves are, you&#039;ll never be a Wonderbolt.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust glared at Rainbow Dash, but the other pegasus just looked back at her with a cool, steady expression. Finally, Dust&#039;s wings sagged, and she looked away. “I... I need some time alone...”</p><p class="double">She heard the other ponies trot off, and started when a wing-tip touched her shoulder. Rainbow Dash was standing there with a more sympathetic expression. “When you&#039;re ready, I&#039;ll be in barracks if you want to talk. For what It&#039;s worth, I think you can do this. I know it&#039;s not easy, but then the really important things never are.”</p><p class="double">As she walked away, she called back over her shoulder. “After all, for a Wonderbolt, the bigger the challenge, the better we like it!” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.4 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;K-Keep &#039;em comin&#039; barkeep,&quot; a drunk, human Twilight Sparkle slurred as she watched her pony self, loyal student of Tyrant Sun Celestia, speak to the United Nations on national TV.</p><p class="double"> <i>&quot;Ponification fixes all the problems with your people. We get rid of that pesky human nature and reconfigure you to live in harmony with others.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">A loud thwack echoed through the room as the anchor smacked her head against the stainless steel counter. Oh, how she hated Bureau loops. But this one finally pushed her over the top. It was enough that her teacher who she knew and loved for centuries was twisted into a mockery of everything she knew and loved. Now, it was her that was being twisted. Worse, it was in front of her very eyes.</p><p class="double">The real irony though was that she wasn&#039;t alone. No, a human looper Celestia was resting her chin on the counter next to her student. She wasn&#039;t quite as drunk as Twilight, but still swayed when she sat up in her seat. After downing another shot of brandy, the anchor tried calling for Spike and turned towards the corner where &#039;spike&#039; watched with interest, &quot;&#039;Take a note Spike, this tops the list in terms of bad loops...No more about Rainbow always dressing in style or Eik...Eik...that school loop where we can&#039;t use magic. Even the loop where Pinkie became an alicorn princess wasn&#039;t as bad as this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia held up her glass and swirled the ice, &quot;Twilight...that&#039;s a dog.&quot;</p><p class="double">A happy bark echoed from that corner. The other patrons didn&#039;t pay them much attention as the Twilight on the tv continued to dig herself a deep grave she could never escape. Human Twilight looked to her teacher, &quot;Well, better get this fixed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded as the two rose from their seats and stumbled out the door.</p><p class="double">*****</p><p class="double">The two stared into the night sky from their apartment where they had woken up. Twilight clutched her head as the hangover pounded away, &quot;How did this happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">What had once been the moon was now a whole other planet with a new small moon orbiting it. Celestia didn&#039;t reply right away, &quot;Well...since the other Celestia had teleported the entirety of Equestria into the Pacific Ocean, disrupting all kinds of natural weather currents...I&#039;d have to say Equestria itself was causing disharmony. Theoretically, we restored this planet to its natural harmony by banishing all of the invading Equestria to the moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, &quot;Ok...that explains &#039;Equestria&#039;, but where did &#039;Equestria&#039; get that smaller moon?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia shrugged, &quot;My memories are still fuzzy from last night, but,&quot; she walked over to mug, lifted it up and sniffed, &quot;Since at once point we made some of Luna&#039;s moonshine, I don&#039;t think I want to remember. I only make it when I want to forget something.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered, &quot;Let&#039;s never mention this again.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment she blinked. “Hey, where’d we get the other Elements from? I can only summon Magic, the others I have to get from the Loop if they’re there…”</p><p class="double">“I believe we mugged your friends’ counterparts for them.” Celestia winced at another stab of pain. “Wow, Applejack has a mean right hook. I’m going to have a nasty black eye for a while…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.5</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash fretted quietly as the night wore on. She knew she shouldn’t, she’d worked how to handle this series of events until it was a fine art, but…</p><p class="double">It still hurt seeing what her old friend had become. Or was on the way to becoming.</p><p class="double">Still, it didn’t take very long nowadays to reverse the trend.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, hey, Gilda!” Dash said, giving the griffon a welcoming smile. “Nice to see you after so long.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” Gilda said, with none of her usual enthusiasm. She frowned, then shook her head. “Yeah.” This time was much more natural, and after considering what it might mean for a moment Dash just decided to ignore it. (Maybe there’d been some bad weather? Dash had tried to understand what time looping did to the weather, once, but it had made her head hurt when Twilight got onto Lorentz attractors and so she gave up.)</p><p class="double">“Okay, so what do you want to do first?” Dash asked, flaring her wings. “Flying? I’ve picked up some <i>really</i> cool tricks since last time we saw each other…”</p><p class="double">“Maybe later…” Gilda looked around as though trying to spot something, but came up blank. “Actually… hey, back east I met this guy called Gas- G- Gustav, that’s it. He was… kinda strange, but I bet you’ve never eaten <i>anything</i> more tasty than what he made.”</p><p class="double">She grinned, and if it was a bit forced then there was also a lot of genuine humour in it. “But he was kind of scary too. Threatened to tie me to a railway line if I took a muffin before it was ready.”</p><p class="double"><i>Huh</i>, Dash thought absently. <i>Now I want to check if Con Mane is real and if Mulia’s really a ninja…</i></p><p class="double">“Sounds like a cool guy,” Dash said. “But do I detect a note of…?”</p><p class="double">Gilda looked blank.</p><p class="double">Dash rolled her eyes. “And I thought <i>I</i> was the unobservant one. Did you fancy him?”</p><p class="double">“Ew, no.” Gilda stuck her tongue out. “He was, like, old.”</p><p class="double">Both of them laughed at that.</p><p class="double">“Anyway, I was…” Gilda paused again. “I was kind of wondering what kind of friends you have, now.” She held up a claw. “But only the awesome ones! I only go so far.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I think they can do awesome,” Dash replied, with a cocky grin.</p><p class="double">Internally she was wondering what on Equestria was making this Loop so <i>strange</i>.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…and this is Twilight Sparkle,” Dash said, as they entered the library. “Well, <i>this</i> is her house, since she seems to be out at the moment, but you know what I mean. She’s pretty buckin’ powerful.”</p><p class="double">“Powerful?” Gilda repeated, looking around dubiously. “This is a library.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, it is.” Dash shrugged. “But hay, there’s a few here that <i>I</i> read. I mean, look!”</p><p class="double">She swooped up and picked the first Daring Do book off a shelf. “Isn’t that just basically me with a different coat and mane?”</p><p class="double">Gilda looked from the book cover to Dash. “It really is. Huh.”</p><p class="double">“And she’s kind of awesome, too, she even gets a broken wing at one point and it doesn’t slow her down, and…” Dash trailed off. “I was talking about Twilight, wasn’t I?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Gilda nodded, and sniggered. “I’m reminded of when I helped you revise.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, I did just as much helping!” Dash objected. “When I remembered…”</p><p class="double">“Which was twice.” The griffin shook her head. “Anyway. That unicorn you were talking about?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, she’s probably the most powerful spellcaster in history.”</p><p class="double">“Like you’re the fastest pony in history?”</p><p class="double">“Both are true!” Dash said quickly. “No word of exaggeration. I’ll show you later, actually. But yeah, Twi is… kind of awe-inspiring, really. I’ve seen her take telekinetic control of a collapsing dam and… <i>un</i>-collapse it. I’ve seen her fight monsters and consider it a normal day.” Dash’s voice became slightly distant. “I’ve seen Twilight teleport to the moon and back.”</p><p class="double">She’d seen Twilight do a <i>lot</i> more than that, too, but most of the examples she could think of required more explanation.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, yeah.” Dash pointed. “Twilight. Hey, Twilight, meet my old school friend Gilda.”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “Hold on a minute…” She darted over to a bookshelf and picked something out. Paging through it, she reached the page she was looking for before either flier could get more than a little bit confused.</p><p class="double">“Micro-expressions!” she shouted, apropos of nothing obvious.</p><p class="double">Whirling on one hoof, she pointed at Gilda. “How long have you been Looping?”</p><p class="double">“Oh!” Dash said, Gilda’s behaviour suddenly making a lot more sense.</p><p class="double">Seeing that the griffin seemed lost, Twilight steered her over to a seat with the gentle pressure of a foreleg. “Come here. You might not know the terminology, but I can tell you recognized me – so you’ve clearly met me before, and you haven’t normally met me before, and there’s nothing different than standard about this loop so you’ve come back in time. Hi, by the way, nice to meet you.”</p><p class="double">Gilda blinked. “Hey, Dash, I thought that pink earth pony was the talkative one.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, you just caught Twilight in geek mode,” Dash replied casually. “Hey, what kind of party do you prefer? ‘cause I need to let Pinkie know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.6</p><p class="double">Takeru “T.K.” Takaishi grimaced down at his body. “You know, when you were the human and I was the digimon… I complained, I understand that.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus sitting next to him grinned.</p><p class="double">“I said I looked like a My Little Pony. And I might have said some things which, on balance, could be viewed as rude.”</p><p class="double">“Keep going…” Pegasusmon said, still smiling. “Oh, and that reminds me, since this isn’t our normal world I’m Shoya again.”</p><p class="double">“Sure, standard practice.” TK paused. “Where was I?”</p><p class="double">“Things which could be viewed as rude.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” The earth pony nodded. “I take them all back. Now I <i>am</i> a flippin’ My Little Pony!”</p><p class="double">“Hey, don’t knock it,” Shoya commented. “This looks like gen IV. Much better than the others.”</p><p class="double">“Define better,” TK deadpanned.</p><p class="double">“Actual dangerous villains, a working and dynamic society, powerful magic and-”</p><p class="double">Something exploded overhead.</p><p class="double">“-that,” Shoya finished, nodding skywards at a series of expanding coloured rings. “Awesome in a can.”</p><p class="double">TK examined his friend and partner closely. “Are you blushing.”</p><p class="double">“No. Yes. Maybe…” the digimon trailed off. “Look, my armour form is a pegasus, alright? I… may have watched the show.”</p><p class="double">“I would tease you about that for centuries,” the erstwhile Anchor said, “but I have absolutely no standing on the grounds that I’m a pony more often than you are a pegasus.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, Rookie forms are like that.” Shoya tossed his head. “Come on, let’s try and find out if the plot expects us for something.”</p><p class="double">Putting action to words, he spread his wings and shot off upwards.</p><p class="double">“I can’t fly!” TK shouted after the rapidly receding pegasus. “Oh, this is just perfect.”</p><p class="double">Feeling stubborn, he got out his D3 and began playing Tetris. It was about five minutes before he noticed he was doing it with hooves.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Wait a sec, Gils,” Dash said, screeching to a halt mid-sky and backwinging. “I didn’t recognize that pegasus.”</p><p class="double">“Right,” Gilda said, turning in a slow loop as she had to be more conscious of her speed – not having Dash’s insane acceleration. “I’m guessing that’s unusual in these… loops?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Dash pointed. “Right there.”</p><p class="double">Gilda focused. “Wait, is he wearing armour?”</p><p class="double">“Huh, he is. Maybe it’s just a lost guard…” Dash pondered the problem for a bit. It was only Gilda’s third loop, and she was still learning the basics.</p><p class="double">On the other hand, every bit of practice helped. “Come on, we’ll see what he has to say. Twilight can probably sort it out, whatever it is.”</p><p class="double">“You really trust her, don’t you…” Gilda said quietly.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I kind of do. You know we’ve spent a couple of loops as the Royal Sisters? Second time, I didn’t screw up, and we just… lived and ruled for over a thousand years. I know her <i>really</i> well.”</p><p class="double">“I kind of wish I knew you half as well.” The griffin shook her head, and returned to the topic of the moment. “He seems to be experimenting with how clouds work.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, sweet!” Dash pointed. “Come on, we got us a guest Looper!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, if I understand this right…” Twilight said, scanning a digital library on her PADD, “You are from Digimon Adventure.”</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Shoya said with a nod. “Me and T.K. are the Anchors for that Loop. We’ve been all over the place.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I imagine you have…” Twilight noted it down.</p><p class="double">“And it’s pretty cool to be here, actually… when are we? That’s Gilda, so… before or after she normally shows up?”</p><p class="double">“Before,” Dash said with a shrug. “You turned up pretty sharpish. She’s a Looper now, but that’s recent.”</p><p class="double">“It’s interesting to meet someone who’s actually familiar with the show version of our world.” Twilight added. “We’re used to it from the inside, of course, so seeing it on the screen is a little strange. Oh - where’s your co-Anchor?”</p><p class="double">“…oh, snap…” Shoya gulped. “Well, probably in the middle of a Pinkie Pie Party by now.”</p><p class="double">The doors flew open with a bang, and Pinkie dragged a bewildered T.K in by the ear. “You could have mentioned you came here with somepony else! Now I need to make a whole new party theme for <i>two</i> new local Loopers! Stay right here, and I’ll be back in five minutes!”</p><p class="double">She bounced out, leaving by the window.</p><p class="double">T.K. looked like he’d been bowled over by a bus.</p><p class="double">His partner leant over. “See, you would have expected this if you’d just watched the show like I did.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.7</p><p class="double">Spike soared over the dense canopy of the Everfree forest, letting single wing beats and thermals carry him across the cloak of green.</p><p class="double">Of all the things the Loops had brought him, he thought flying was the best. </p><p class="double">Well, aside from the people who looped with him… but they weren’t things, anyway. Flying was a skill… or, rather, several. There were so many kinds of it, from the effortless speed of a pegasus to the ponderous flight of a great wyrm. Right now, he was about thirty feet in wingspan, which gave him options.</p><p class="double">Humming a jaunty tune, he set a course south – then frowned, squinting down at the ground, and flared the big wings before coming to a hover.</p><p class="double">Yes, there was definitely something down there that didn’t belong.</p><p class="double">Spike let air slip out from under his wing membranes and gradually lost height, trying to get close enough to confirm what he’d seen.</p><p class="double"><i>Aha!</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A large wolf loped steadily along under the dappled sunlight. <i>Things</i> stirred as it passed, but none of them did more than stir.</p><p class="double">The canine slowed as it reached a low ridge, sniffed, and then turned a little and resumed the ground-eating pace. Leaf litter and twigs crunched underfoot, and when the wolf came to a cliff it bounded up in a series of huge leaps, ground-root-branch-trunk and then to the top.</p><p class="double">Eventually, a clearing opened out in the middle of the forest, one cut by a huge fallen tree. Climbing the side of the trunk in a scrabble of claws, the wolf padded along to the middle of the trunk and sat.</p><p class="double">Leaves rustled in a sudden, intense wind, as Spike backwinged into the clearing. He landed lightly enough on the end of the tree nearest the roots.</p><p class="double">“Good afternoon,” he said cheerfully. “I didn’t realize you did this.”</p><p class="double">“Not very often…” the wolf replied. “But the Everfree is the only really <i>wild</i> place on Equestria… sometimes I just feel the need to get away. And I feel… safer like this.”</p><p class="double">The animal blurred, and Fluttershy was stood there instead. “But if you want-”</p><p class="double">“No, no, don’t change back on my account,” Spike protested. “It’s not often I see you so confident, it’s probably good for you.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you…” she muttered. “But I did bring a lunch, and wolves can’t eat chocolate. So I may as well eat now.” Fluttershy managed a little giggle. “I’m sure the big scary dragon will keep me safe.”</p><p class="double">Spike posed. It was hard to tell if he was seriously trying to look macho or just trying to make her laugh.</p><p class="double">A moment later, he dropped it. “I do know how you feel, though. It’s good to just meditate once in a while.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you. Oh, would you like some?”</p><p class="double">He waved it off. “No, I’ve been eating too much Bluejohn, I need to lose some weight.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you’re too big for it to just be baby fat…” she said critically, and Spike laughed.</p><p class="double">“That whole wolf thing is really working out for you, huh?”</p><p class="double">“Sometimes. Other times I try being a leopard, or… something.” Fluttershy looked at the ground. “I’m probably not very good at it by Oerth standards, I just can’t get the hang of, er, hunting.”</p><p class="double">“Really, that’s not a problem,” Spike said, shaking his head. “Instincts can be overrated. Take it from the dragon!”</p><p class="double">They sat in companionable silence for the next half hour or so, as Fluttershy ate and then carefully stored all the leavings in her subspace pocket to recycle.</p><p class="double">Eventually, the pegasus stood up with a purposeful air. “Nice seeing you, Spike,” she said, and blurred back into an animal. Spike was slightly surprised to notice that this one was a puma, but she winked at him and then padded off.</p><p class="double">Being a druid was really working out well for Fluttershy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as the loop memories flowed in. &quot;Hmm, this seems to be fairly baseline. I wonder if--&quot;</p><p class="double">Her ears perked. Something was... off. It sounded as though somepony was mimicking her word for word.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello?&quot;</p><p class="double">There it was again! A voice, to her left! She turned to look and came face to face with herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;......huh. This is new.&quot;</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">&quot;So let me get this straight,&quot; Luna deadpanned. &quot;Everyone who&#039;s awake this loop spontaneously duplicated when they awakened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeeeeyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">The princess of the night let her gaze shift from one red stallion to the other, slowly licking her ice cream. &quot;This is... quite an interesting development.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah know, right?&quot; Apple Bloom grinned. &quot;First thang we did, tried ta see if we could double what was in our subspace pocket!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Turns out we share one,&quot; her duplicate said with a shrug. &quot;Oh well. Still pretty useful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see...&quot; Luna rolled her eyes. &quot;Shame I didn&#039;t get a duplicate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh and what am I, chopped hay?&quot;</p><p class="double">The princess smiled down at the alicorn filly. &quot;No, Nyx, you&#039;re a very special pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx mock pouted before taking a huge bite of her ice cream. &quot;Oh fiiiiiine.&quot;</p><p class="double">She blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I just realized. I have two mommies.&quot;</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">Celestia’s pen moved furiously on her paperwork, glancing at the clock on occasion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Five more minutes. Just five more minutes and we switch out.&quot;</p><p class="double">She already had her trunks on.</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">Cadance whispered something to Cadance.</p><p class="double">Cadance grinned.</p><p class="double">Shining gulped. &quot;We&#039;re in for a long night, aren&#039;t we?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...yep.&quot; Shining blushed. &quot;I don&#039;t know if this is a good or a bad thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">Carrot Cake and Cupcake peered into the kitchen cautiously.</p><p class="double">&quot;...There&#039;s two of them, hon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...What do we do dear?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We pray. We pray.&quot;</p><p class="double">***</p><p class="double">&quot;DOUBLE RAINBOOM ALL THE WAY!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;SO INTENSE!!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT COULD IT MEAN?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">25.9 (Filraen – Vulpine Fury - Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gilda tried to doze under the shadow of a tree in an effort to trying to collect her thoughts. Flying had only made the matters worse because it made her remember Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">She could understand griffins and ponies grow and change when you don&#039;t see them in some time, but Gilda knew the first time they met after Dash moved into Ponyville she didn&#039;t leave a good impression of herself. And looking back at that incident she was quite upset with herself, even if no one else would ever know it.</p><p class="double">And somehow, by some strange magic she had a chance to start over again... well, not from the very beginning in Cloudsdale but from the time in Ponyville. It was strange, going to her after seeing that long night and the rumours of a Nightmare Moon again, but somehow she saw the chance to meet Dash again without the weight of the previous time.</p><p class="double">To her surprise not only did Rainbow apparently know a bit of what was happening, but she had been &quot;looping&quot; longer than Gilda. Apparently she could grew herself a horn which let herself do some magic, learned to perform a Sonic Rainboom – how crazy was that? – from a standing position, got herself a fancy necklace about loyalty something or other and could tell a lot of crazy stories. Gilda preferred to just give Dash some beak service and pretend she believed them.</p><p class="double">Because if Gilda actually believed Rainbow Dash&#039;s stories it&#039;d mean creatures like humans existed. Because it&#039;d mean she’d live these years again and again and again with no end on sight. Because it&#039;d mean there are places so big that the Griffin lands would be less than a drop of water in the sea. Because it&#039;d mean Rainbow Dash had lived through all of this a long time. Because it&#039;d mean Dash had really flown through space, defeated the Nightmare Moon and raced a supersonic hedgehog. Because it&#039;d mean she had really been the Equestrian Princess multiple times, raised the Sun and ruled for millennia. Because it&#039;d mean she had become so awesome and close to those other ponies in as many lives as Gilda had feathers...</p><p class="double">Because if she believed Rainbow Dash, what could Gilda hope to offer to her friend? </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;G?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked quietly. &quot;You really feel that way? That you don&#039;t matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda lowered her eyes. How could she, just a griffin somehow caught up in this weirdness compare to a flipping <i>alicorn princess?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Should I tell you about the loops where we never lost touch with each other after flight camp?&quot; The sad look on the polychrome pegasus&#039; face was almost wrenching. &quot;Those were pretty cool. How about the ones where I&#039;m the griffin and you&#039;re the pegasus? Or the ones just like the first time through for all of us and I knew the thing to say to make you stay? I like those Loops. I don&#039;t have to choose between my first best friend and my other best friends. Gilda. Friendship is like love. It doesn&#039;t diminish when it&#039;s shared.&quot; </p><p class="double">The griffin still looked dubious.</p><p class="double">Dash kicked the floor. “Ah, buck it, I’m no good at these kinda talks. Come on, let’s see what Twilight thinks.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight listened in silence as Gilda spoke. When the griffin finished, she inhaled deeply and then let out a long sigh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gilda, I&#039;m an Anchor. Which means I&#039;ve been awake for every single loop. Sure I&#039;ve gotten powerful, but among Anchors and other long time loopers the truism is ‘with great power comes great insanity.’&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been better than most, but even I&#039;ve had moments where I slipped. You&#039;ll find this out yourself, but imagine everyone around you had a disease. They remember everything up to a certain day. After that, they can&#039;t keep a new memory past a full day. They just keep forgetting and reliving the same day, over and over again. Only you remember and grow.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn eyed the griffin. &quot;How long before you stopped seeing them as friends out of frustration? How many days till you stopped seeing them as people at all? How many weeks till you started meddling, manipulating them for what is &#039;best&#039;? How many months till you started smashing them in frustration that they can&#039;t bucking remember anything?!&quot; The unicorn&#039;s mane toinged out.</p><p class="double">Gilda’s instincts spiked from nothing, screaming at her to run or fight… or just stand perfectly still, in the hope that whatever was causing that fear wouldn’t deign to notice her.</p><p class="double">It was then that she began to really believe, bone-deep, that Dash was right.</p><p class="double">Twilight stopped, closed her eyes, and breathed deeply, pushing away with a forelimb several times before continuing. &quot;I think that is the root of a lot of madness among Loopers. Offer Dash nothing? Gilda, she has hope of seeing her friend now, not an endless parade of someone wearing your face that can&#039;t remember the real her anymore.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda looked down again, then raised her eyes. “I can try that.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Good. Hey, you might like to ask Dash for pictures. She enjoys your company, you know, even the non-looping you. Ask about something called Metal Wolf…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i></p><p class="double"><i>This loop I had to be reminded to take care of others, putting myself in their hooves if necessary. I was so happy my friend Gilda had Awoke I forgot how overwhelming looping could get for a newcomer, and I showed off too much too soon.

It was neither the first time, nor the last – as anyone, Looper or not, could attest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s go over the checklist one last time Spike.&quot; Twilight said while giving her assistant a rolled scroll.</p><p class="double">After nodding, Spike took a quill from the nearby desk and started reading the scroll. &quot;Bedroom tidy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Check.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Living room clean?&quot;</p><p class="double">After a sound of teleportation Twilight answered, &quot;Good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tea?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Enough in kitchen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cookies?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Here too,&quot; Twilight paused and closed her eyes briefly before continuing, &quot;and also the super special secret sweetheart cake stash from Sugarcube Corner.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike frowned and looked around. &quot;Where it is this so secret stash?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight teased back, &quot;If I told you it wouldn&#039;t be so secret anymore.&quot; There&#039;s no need to mention Spike about subspace pockets, good to keep things from some powerful magical artifacts to snacks when one doesn&#039;t want to go to the kitchen to get them and break the conversation. &quot;Also, those are for when Princess Celestia visits tonight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;True enough&quot; Spike said thoughtfully. &quot;Anyway, do you think why Princess Celestia will come here this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">It isn&#039;t like it mattered much, though this loop her mentor decided to have delivered Twilight&#039;s Friendship Reports in person instead of Spike&#039;s magic flame. It was basically an excuse for Celestia to share more time with Twilight but the unicorn realized it helped honor Celestia&#039;s wish &#039;to get to know her all over again&#039;. In that case it was... &quot;Probably to change scenery? I&#039;m not sure.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia arrived soon after sunset. And then Celestia and Twilight shared a table chatting the night away, sleep claiming Spike within the hour.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;The Great Galloping Gala is in three months. Do you know if anypony still wants to go?&quot; Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably, though I have to make sure their expectations aren&#039;t too high.&quot; It wasn&#039;t like anypony else was awake this loop, Twilight considered, then suddenly tried to contain a laugh. &quot;Still, if you wanted to spice the Gala up a bit, why don&#039;t you invite Steven Magnet?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean that river serpent who lives in Everfree?&quot; At Twilight&#039;s nod both laughed. &quot;Probably – he may like a social event like that and one way or other he will make that Gala one to remember.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;How is Princess Luna faring this loop?&quot; Twilight asked after producing two slices of cake.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good enough. She&#039;s currently in the phase of trying to get out but afraid of the rejection.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Send her here.&quot; Twilight shrugged. It wouldn&#039;t be Nightmare Night for some time but it&#039;d probably be for the better. &quot;Everything should be fine as long as you tell Luna to tone down her voice and I tell Pinkie not to play scared.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a pause the white alicorn looked at her faithful student in the eyes &quot;Twilight, did you just tempt fate?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight felt her ears droop &quot;I hope not.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;How is Starlight Breaker doing nowadays?&quot; Celestia teased.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know she doesn&#039;t like that name.&quot; Twilight mock-glared her mentor. &quot;I saw her ten or so loops ago. Apparently a new looper from Ranma&#039;s world decided to try yet another desperate attempt to finish the loops and we met at Hogwarts, together with Ranma, Harry, and Hiccup. She says she wants to show a new magic fireworks display next time she&#039;s in Equestria... Now that I think of it I fear the day she and Trixie meet.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;That reminds me, how long has been since the last loop Cadence has been Awake?&quot; the white alicorn asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... actually lost count.&quot; Twilight frowned, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Enough loops to actually lost count and yet you haven&#039;t fallen into madness, my faithful student.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a sip of her tea to give herself some time before answering. &quot;It&#039;s only because I have everypony looping alongside me. I don&#039;t think I could have actually handled living through the loops alone.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled. &quot;Then it&#039;s a good thing it doesn&#039;t matter if you could or not, because you don&#039;t have to.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, feeling her eyes water, could only nod.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, the fact you have lived through so many loops yet we still can meet here to chat calmly means you have grown beyond my and anypony&#039;s wildest expectations, so much I can&#039;t see you as my student anymore.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess...&quot; Twilight could only say, feeling somewhat numb.</p><p class="double">Standing up, Celestia hardened her tone just slightly &quot;Twilight Sparkle, it&#039;s my greatest pride and honour to graduate you tonight of your studies of the Magic of Friendship under me. I can only ask of you: Twilight, will you accept my friendship?&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn took a moment to react, but then she threw herself into Celestia&#039;s embrace, both nuzzling each other. No more words were needed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>26.1</p><p class="double">“You look a bit down,” a voice said.</p><p class="double">Gilda looked to one side, and saw a blue unicorn slide into the seat next to her.</p><p class="double">“Yeah…” she said, going back to her drink. “I just can’t connect with Dash.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that’s hardly surprising…” the blue unicorn said. “I mean, she’s not Looping this time.”</p><p class="double">Gilda’s head snapped around. “What?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, don’t try and cover it up…” the unicorn winked. “You’re not bad as actors go, but my special talent is half about misdirection. I’m Trixie Lulamoon, by the way. I was actually one of the newbies until you showed up.”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “Besides, you hardly look like a local. Ponyville does grow on you if you give it time, but…”</p><p class="double">Trixie held up a hoof. The red stallion running the bar slid over a glass of something fizzy and apple scented.</p><p class="double">“…you’re not a regular,” she finished. “Actually, on that front, how are you finding it here?”</p><p class="double">The griffin tried to assimilate everything that had just happened. “Er… not half bad, actually. Best drink I’ve had in a while, anyway.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “Hear that, Mac?”</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded.</p><p class="double">“This is kinda a new thing – a few centuries old,” Trixie said, then winced. “Sorry, that was probably a bit tactless of me.”</p><p class="double">“You think?” Gilda shook her head again. “This whole thing is difficult to cope with.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you’ll always be welcome here.”</p><p class="double">“Stop makin’ promises for me, Trixie,” Mac said amiably, “or you’ll make one ah wouldn’t have made mahself… one day.”</p><p class="double">“Not today, though,” Trixie shot back. “Anyway, Mac’s kind of doing this to help loopers like you – ones who just need a bit of relaxation, you can talk to him about anything. He’s really in demand when loopers from other worlds come in, ‘cause they’re usually from places a lot more, well, violent than our own.”</p><p class="double">“I wouldn’t mind that…” Gilda said, ruefully. “A bit of excitement, I mean.”</p><p class="double">Trixie’s eyes lit up. “Really? You like excitement? Loud bangs, adrenaline, intense risk?”</p><p class="double">Gilda nodded, almost against her will. “Yeah, that does sound pretty good right now…”</p><p class="double">“Trixie will give you excitement!” With a flash, a hat and cape materialized on the blue unicorn. “Come on, let’s go!”</p><p class="double">“Go where?” Gilda asked, reasonably.</p><p class="double">“That’s not the important bit! It’s the journey, not the destination.” Trixie paused. “Though at this point I think the destination should probably be King Sombra’s treasury.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Shining Armor and Princess Cadence walked warily into the palace of the Crystal Empire, on the look out for the evil being who had once taken it over.</p><p class="double">“Dear,” Cadence asked after a moment, “why are there so many suits of armour lying around ripped to bits?”</p><p class="double">“No idea,” Shining admitted. “They look like they got ripped to bits… and that one seems to have been struck by lightning.”</p><p class="double">“Should we wait for your sister and her friends?” Cadence shrugged. “I don’t know how dangerous this might be…”</p><p class="double">“No,” Shining replied after a moment. “If worst comes to worst, we can always teleport out.”</p><p class="double">They both heard the singing at the same moment.</p><p class="double">Shining built a charge on his horn. Cadence, still thinking a little like a pegasus, took off to be ready to ambush whoever might attack her husband.</p><p class="double">“…with a snail if you slow to a crawl,” two drunken voices shouted. “But the hedgehog-”</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Shining said, squinting. “Isn’t that… hey!”</p><p class="double">The singing stopped.</p><p class="double">“You, the blue unicorn,” Shining continued, “Aren’t you Trixie? Twilight’s friend?”</p><p class="double">“I am indeed,” Trixie replied, bowing deeply. Her hat fell off. “I am indeed Trixie Lulamoon. Queen Trixie!”</p><p class="double">“Pardon?” Shining asked, looking at Cadence for any kind of support she might be able to give. She shrugged helplessly, lowering herself slowly to the floor.</p><p class="double">Her companion pointed at the battered crown on top of Trixie’s head. “See? She’s queen ‘cause she beat up the king. That’s how it works,” she added with the assurance of the deeply sloshed, and looked owlishly at the empty bottle she was carrying in her right foreleg. “Hey, your majesty?”</p><p class="double">No response.</p><p class="double">“That’s you,” the griffin added, elbowing Trixie, who gave a start.</p><p class="double">“Yes! Me. What was it, lord high… thingy… Gilda?”</p><p class="double">“We ran out of spoils of victory again.”</p><p class="double">Trixie looked downcast. “Maybe one of these times we’ll get our spoils of victory out of the building before drinking it all.”</p><p class="double">Cadence plucked the bottle out of Gilda’s grip. “This is one of the bottles from the royal reserve, down in the dungeons.”</p><p class="double">Shining gaped. “You mean… they really <i>did</i> defeat Sombra?”</p><p class="double">“It was <i>so</i> cool,” Gilda said, with gestures. “Trix went kind of glowy and then grew wings, and then magicked him so hard it collapsed a wall on him.”</p><p class="double">“Wings?” Shining and Cadence exchanged a glance.</p><p class="double">“Hey, you want this?” Trixie asked, pulling the Crystal Heart out of her fallen hat. “I don’t want it, but it’s shiny.”</p><p class="double">Cadence’ eyes widened.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Shining said quickly. “And in return, we’ll do all the admin and paperwork associated with your position.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Trixie blinked, then snatched the crown off her head. “Paperwork, ew. I didn’t know it came with paperwork. You want it, Gilda?”</p><p class="double">“No chance!” Gilda warded Trixie off.</p><p class="double">“Ah well.” Trixie drop-kicked the crown into the distance. “Shall we go get some more spoils of war?”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good!”</p><p class="double">Trixie wrapped them both in magic, and they vanished.</p><p class="double">Shining looked at where they’d been for a moment. “…well, that sorted itself out.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Trixiiie?” Gilda moaned through a blinding headache, “Why did we do this again?”</p><p class="double">“Because you need to learn awesome on your own!” Trixie said, then winced. Flaring her horn, she applied an anti-hangover spell, which took the edge off. “Dash is pretty cool, yeah, but you can’t define yourself around her. You need to be your own, er, griffin.”</p><p class="double">She winked. “Besides, now <i>you</i> have a cool story to tell <i>her.</i>”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">26.1 omake (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">(This one may or may not slot in perfectly, but it would have to go here if it did.)</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Gilda! I heard about the way you beat on King Sombra. Awesome!&quot; Rainbow Dash called out.</p><p class="double">The bleary eyed griffon just groaned and pulled the cloud she was lying in around and over herself, trying to escape the rays of Celestia&#039;s sun and the overly cheery voice of her best friend, though right now she was thinking equicidal thoughts about her. The groan was a mistake, as it was a signal for the pain in various parts of her body to spawn hundreds of lesser pains which then moved out and took apartments in new parts of her body. Nomadic buffalo photons stampeded down her optic nerve and headbutted her brain, intensifying the Rainboom class headache that was already there. Her mouth tasted like a graveyard which had been used by a rave venue by the incontinent... she was hung-over, no, she was HUNG-OVER. Gahhh, Even thinking in capital letters hurt, and so did the tips of her feathers, that shouldn&#039;t even be possible!</p><p class="double">Griffons had the constitution of a buffalo, or rather buffaloes had the constitution of a griffon, but she and Trixie had drunk about half a cellar of King Sombra&#039;s private reserve. Crystal berry wine was sweet, fragrant with a wonderful undertone of honeysuckle and chocolate, and had a kick like an earth-pony on steroids, and that was before it had a thousand years to mature and increase in potency in a high magic environment. So it wasn&#039;t just a hang-over, it was a magic hang-over, and even Trixie&#039;s magic had only served to ease the pain.</p><p class="double">A vial flumped in the cloud beside her. &quot;Here, drink up! This is a little something Apple Bloom whipped up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;uuuhh. Is it poison? Something quick and painless would go down well right now.&quot; At least Dash was being slightly quieter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh, hang-over cure. Guaranteed to move that thunderhead of a hang-over, or your thunderhead cheerfully refunded.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda snatched it up and popped the cork with a claw-tip, then gulped it down. There was no way it could make her condition worse, at any rate. It fizzed over her tongue in a peculiar way, and then she felt as if some-pony had stuck a hose in her mouth and turned it on full blast, and water was shooting out of every pore in her body. She swelled up like a balloon and popped, and when she recovered, the pain was gone. In fact, she was ready to fight dragons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa! Now that is what I call a cure! Who is this Apple Bloom, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Earth-pony looper. Kid sister of my friend Applejack. She&#039;s been learning Zebra potion magic for… a lot of loops, so she knows what she&#039;s doing. She makes them for Mac&#039;s Cafe Equestrian. Twilight is taking one to Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh? You&#039;re Awake?&quot; Gilda did a double take.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, not every-pony Wakes at the start of a loop, sometimes it doesn&#039;t happen till much later, though it&#039;s pretty rare. Gotta admit, you and Trixie teaming up? Never have figured it, but it makes a lot of sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not mad?&quot; Gilda asked, shocked at the warmth she heard in Dash&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shrugged, shaking her head. &quot;Having other friends doesn&#039;t make your best friendship less... best. I&#039;d be pretty hypocritical if I got mad over you being friends with other ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda chuckled. &quot;I never thought I&#039;d hear Rainbow Dash use the word &#039;hypocritical&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash joined in. &quot;Yeah... Blame it on the time I looped into a world where Daring Doo was real. I know because I was her. Heh, if ever a loop taught me that being an athelete and an egg-head weren&#039;t mutually exclusive that was the one. That pony was in Twilight&#039;s league, but bucked flank like us...&quot;</p><p class="double">She saw Gilda&#039;s face fall slightly. &quot;Hey, buck up, you&#039;ll get your own awesome adventures now that you&#039;re loopy. What I was saying is friendship isn&#039;t a limited thing. The more you have, the more you get, and the more you can share. Speaking of sharing, I was looking you up to share some awesome with you. How&#039;d you like to learn how to do a Sonic Rainboom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re serious?&quot; Gilda&#039;s eyes widened.</p><p class="double">&quot;No I&#039;m Rainbow Dash... sorry Hogwarts joke... oh pony-feathers, we&#039;ve got a <i>lot</i> of catching up to do. Time for a pop-corn memory session with Apple Bloom&#039;s way-back machine after this. It can read a person&#039;s memories and play them back like a movie. It&#039;ll prepare you if you ever end up in the same places, which seems likely.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought you said she was all about potions?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s just a sideline, she&#039;s been looping for a long time, and it turns out her talent is putting together really cool tech. She&#039;s been in lots of fused loops where things are pretty much science fiction, and learned how to use it. Hmmm... I think we&#039;ll start you on an X-Wing, it&#039;s robust and fairly easy to get the hang of... that&#039;s if you want to learn how to pilot a space fighter. Or maybe a giant robot. Or we can get her to fit you with thruster boots and an atmosphere containment harness and the two of us can take a trip around the moon...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa!&quot; Gilda&#039;s feathers were toinging out a bit. &quot;I... ahh...&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash face-hooved. &quot;Nice going Rainbow Crash! Sorry Gilda, I&#039;m doing it again. You need to adjust to the loops at your pace, not be forced into anything you aren&#039;t ready for. It&#039;s just... I have so many cool things I want to share with you, and I want to do it right now! Look, for the rest of this loop, you set the pace. You want to learn how to do a Sonic Rainboom? Fine. Want to try and get into the Wonderbolts Academy with me? We can do that. Want to just spend the time playing cloudball, surfing the air-currents and kicking back on a cloud while listening to rocking tunes? I&#039;m good with that too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That last one sounds real good...&quot; Gilda said, watching for any sign of disappointment in her friend&#039;s eyes. There was none, only concern for her friend, and she remembered Twilight&#039;s words. Then she made a decision. &quot;But learning a Sonic Rainboom sounds good too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash punched the air with a hoof. &quot;Yes! We are going to have so much fun!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>26.2</p><p class="double">“Twilight, you need to go and retrieve the Element of Magic from-”</p><p class="double">Twilight closed her eyes and concentrated. With a flash of light, her Magic tiara rematerialized on her brow. “Done. What now?”</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked. “Since when could you do that?”</p><p class="double">“It’s been a while.” Twilight shrugged. “You were saying?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, nothing.” Celestia got a little smile on her face. “Excuse me, I need to go nail this mirror to the ceiling of a prison cell.”</p><p><hr></p><p>26.3</p><p class="double">The Mayor pointed. “Who is that masked figure?”</p><p class="double">Dash followed her gaze, and grinned. “Oh, right, that’s the Mysterious Mare-Do-Well. I ran into her once.”</p><p class="double">The silhouette spread wings and took off, flaring a horn to launch a bolt of ice almost directly at the crowd.</p><p class="double">“Whoah!” Dash ducked along with the rest of them, and the bolt splashed off a shield made out of plants.</p><p class="double">From inside the shield, a second figure emerged clad head-to-toe in bright forest green. The new pony spread wings and leapt into the air, trees growing from the rooftops as support.</p><p class="double">“Hmm, that doesn’t seem right…” Dash said. She bent down next to the mayor. “That’s I Be Leaf. I’ve not seen her like this before…”</p><p class="double">The blue pegasus tapped her chin. “Hang on a second. I’m gonna go have a look.”</p><p class="double">She shot upwards, then returned to the ground. “Thought so.”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” the mayor asked, worried.</p><p class="double">“Well, I saw…” Dash counted them off. “Sir George the Dragon, a magic user who might have been Madam Magpie, and the Felicitous Fillies. I think Ponyville might have a superhero infestation. Nothing major, just a Crossover Event.”</p><p class="double">A pony wearing a red and black outfit and carrying a boffer sword ran up a nearby wall, seemingly having an argument with itself. Another wearing clothes made like shimmering water rode past on a waterspout, and then a pair of gigantic wings blotted out the sun.</p><p class="double">“Huh…” Dash blinked. “Maybe I was wrong. That looks like a Crisis Crossover. Everypony down!”</p><p class="double">There was a bright flash, and all the battling costumed ponies vanished.</p><p class="double">“What just happened?” Roseluck asked, looking around.</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged. “I think that was a Cosmic Retcon. The whole storyline got too complicated, so it just stopped.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Well, that went well!” Dash said later. “The Mayor was certainly confused…”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Applejack said, sourly, “but it woulda been good if you’d come up with a better superhero type for me. Ah had to be th’ Mare-Do-Well.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, at least you could do all of it at once…” Dash shrugged. “And I think it’d be nice if we perhaps used all of these superhero identities in some other loop.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I can <i>certainly</i> store the costumes until then,” Rarity said cheerfully. “Perhaps we could work out something for you?”</p><p class="double">“Ah’d prefer if ah got to use these,” AJ replied, summoning her Ember Celica from a subspace pocket. “They ain’t used as often as ah’d like.”</p><p class="double">Rarity’s eyes glittered. “One Punch? Hmmm…”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Well, good to know it was funny. And yes, using those costumes again would be nice. Perhaps we could try the whole secret identity thing?”</p><p class="double">“That sounds good,” Fluttershy said quietly.</p><p class="double">“Speak for yourself!” Pinkie said, grinning. She hadn’t taken off her Deadpool-inspired costume yet, and all indications were that she’d just wear it for the rest of the Loop.</p><p><hr></p><p>26.4</p><p class="double">Rarity trotted into the cavern, wearing one of her best dresses. “Hello, mister dragon? I have a business proposition for you.”</p><p class="double">The dragon growled.</p><p class="double">“Here it is,” she said, nonchalantly sitting down on the edge of his hoard. “I take items from your hoard and enchant them, making them much more valuable. Then, I go and sell them, and you get gold and jewels equal to the value of the initial investment plus one half of the profits.”</p><p class="double">“And why should I trust you, pony?” The huge beast sounded almost amused. “This is a transparent ploy to walk off with my most prized possessions.”</p><p class="double">“No, not really…” Rarity shook her head. “You do insult me, sir. I assure you, this is no ploy.” She paused. “Really, must you be stuck in the First Diarchy era? You have to make your gold work <i>for</i> you.”</p><p class="double">“I find it works quite well as a bed. Now, leave before I flame you out,” he said with finality.</p><p class="double">Rarity examined a bracelet. “You know, this would look lovely on a mantelpiece…”</p><p class="double">The dragon inhaled, then let out a jet of flame.</p><p class="double">Lightning-quick, Rarity swept the top layer off her dress and flung it at the dragon’s mouth. “Solute!”</p><p class="double">The gossamer-fabric quivered, then exploded into at least thirty tonnes of salty water. Dragon’s fire met instant wave, and the whole cavern filled with pleasant sea-scent and steam.</p><p class="double">“Ah, lovely,” Rarity said, sniffing the air. “Oh, are you alright?”</p><p class="double">The dragon coughed. “Some of that went up the wrong way!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I am sorry.” She shrugged. “But, well, it proves my bona fides, does it not?”</p><p class="double">There was a silence.</p><p class="double">“…you said two thirds, didn’t you?”</p><p class="double">“For shame!” Rarity kicked the floor. “I am an artisan, not a day labourer! One third.”</p><p class="double">“That is robbery!” Snarls echoed in the confined of the cave, though the effect was spoiled by a cough. “Sixty percent.”</p><p class="double">“Forty-five.”</p><p class="double">“Fifty, then, curse you.”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled broadly. “It’s a deal.”</p><p class="double">The dragon grumbled something about banditry by another name. </p><p class="double">“Oh, hush,” the unicorn replied. “It’s not as though you’re the only person around here with jewellery, you know.”</p><p><hr></p><p>26.5</p><p class="double">“And who do you have for us to listen to?” Cheerilee asked, after everyone was done applauding Granny Smith’s story.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Scootaloo said, and paused. “Does it just have to be a parent or whatever?”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee considered. “It can be a close family friend, if that’s what you mean.”</p><p class="double">“I more meant… biological. But that’s fine.” Scootaloo poked her head out the window. “It’s okay! Come on in!”</p><p class="double">In a blur of multicoloured light, Rainbow Dash skidded to a stop in the classroom.</p><p class="double">Well, almost to a stop.</p><p class="double">“I’m okay!” she shouted from inside the pile of books, to general laughter. “Er… little help here, squirt?”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo and several other fillies and colts dug her out of the collapsed bookcase.</p><p class="double">“Right,” Dash said, preening self-importantly and trying to look like that hadn’t happened, “basically, I’m really, really fast.”</p><p class="double">There was a long pause.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Dash?” Scootaloo stage-whispered.</p><p class="double">“Yeah?”</p><p class="double">“Little more than that?”</p><p class="double">“Okay, whatever.” Dash blew her mane out of her eyes. “So, how about I tell you mini-ponies the story of how I got my cutie mark?”</p><p class="double">As stories went, it was a pretty good one. Not quite as good as Granny Smith’s tale of the founding of Ponyville – every pony in the room could relate to that, whereas only the pegasi had some sense of just how insanely hard a Rainboom was – but Dash told it well, and there were some gasps when she described Fluttershy’s fateful fall. (Though, of course, it was fairly obvious that the pegasus was going to survive. After all, she was a common sight around town.)</p><p class="double">“Did you really break the sound barrier?” Silver Spoon asked, after Dash had finished. “That’s awesome!”</p><p class="double">Diamond didn’t join in the general approval, but given how nasty she could be Scootaloo considered it good enough that she had stopped trying to undermine the Crusaders.</p><p class="double">“Wait a second,” Diamond said, frowning.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo felt like rolling her eyes. <i>Spoke too soon.</i></p><p class="double">“Are you Scootaloo’s sister or something? If you’re so good at flying, how come she’s so terrible at it?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I am,” Dash said, so matter-of-factly and coming so close on the heels of the accusation that tears started in Scootaloo’s eyes. “We didn’t have the same parents, but she’s still my little sis. And who cares about being bad at flying?”</p><p class="double">Coming from a pony who had just described herself as the most awesome flier in existence, this drew a collective jaw drop.</p><p class="double">“…you know what I mean,” Dash added, blushing. “Anyway. Flying’s what I’m good at. Scoots is good at something else.”</p><p class="double">She thought for a second. “Hey, I have this theory… Scoots? Want to help me test something?”</p><p class="double">The younger pegasus looked up at her. “Let me guess. Terrifyingly dangerous, small chance of success, and pure awesome if it works.”</p><p class="double">“You know me too well,” Dash replied, winking.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was still a little nervous, but… well, Dash was old enough and experienced enough that this was at least partly an act. (After all, a crazy and awesome older sister was worth major kudos.)</p><p class="double">“Alright. I trust you.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“I take it baaaaack!” Scootaloo shouted, looking down at the ground miles below.</p><p class="double">Dash grinned. “Hey, this <i>is</i> totally safe.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo held on tighter to Dash’s rainbow mane.</p><p class="double">“…look,” the elder pony said, in a much more serious voice. “You <i>are</i> basically my sister. I meant what I said. And I <i>will</i> save you if this doesn’t work.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo gulped.</p><p class="double">“…okay.” Closing her eyes, she jumped.</p><p class="double">For a moment, she felt completely weightless. Then, as she accelerated, air resistance began to bite.</p><p class="double"><i>Crudcrudcrudcrud! What did Dash say? Air magic, right. Air magic.</i> Reaching out with her weak but well controlled air magic, Scootaloo began shaping the air stream around her to reduce the air resistance. Another thought hit her, and she began flapping her small wings as fast as she could.</p><p class="double">“You’re doing fine!” Dash shouted, easily keeping pace. Scootaloo felt vaguely insulted that her mentor was actually doing this while lying on her back.</p><p><hr></p><p>Halfway to the ground, Scootaloo was feeling overwhelmed.</p><p class="double">She was nearly as fast as she had to be, but somehow getting that little extra speed was beyond her. It was the kind of thing you needed full pegasus wings and strong pegasus magic for, not her half-developed adolescent version.</p><p class="double">The air she was shaping was useful, cutting through the atmosphere like a knife, but-</p><p class="double"><i>Wait!</i></p><p class="double">Like a knife. Or like a well designed fighter aircraft.</p><p class="double">Ideas clicked into place. Scootaloo reached out to her magic and twisted – taking the friction and using it to <i>heat</i> the air, rather than minimizing it.</p><p class="double">Another thought, and she funnelled that air through the main body of her wind cone, which began to flatten and develop distinctive wings. A slight alteration made it begin to spin.</p><p class="double"><i>Thank you, Lockheed-Martin!</i> Scootaloo thought, in the strange euphoria of an epiphany.</p><p class="double">Hot air contacted cold, and-</p><p class="double"><i>WOOSH.</i></p><p><hr></p><p>Every child from the school, even Diamond Tiara, started cheering as the curtain of flame spread across the sky.</p><p class="double">A rainbow one formed behind it, and then Dash’s streak of multicoloured light caught up with a white one trailed by orange flame.</p><p><hr></p><p>“What the buck did you just <i>do</i>?” Dash asked, laughing hysterically as she kept pace with Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">“I think I just made a Blackbird out of weather magic,” Scootaloo replied in a distracted tone. “Hey, it’s about to fall apart ‘cause I can’t work out how to make it stop accelerating. Catch me?”</p><p class="double">“Always,” Dash promised, and, true to her word, plucked the filly out of the air as her fragile air-construct collapsed.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Huh…” Scootaloo said, dazed, and stared at her flank again.</p><p class="double">What was there was a kind of faded, gaseous aircraft-shape made from sonic boom shock clouds. It wasn’t the only cutie mark she’d had, not by a long chalk, but this one was… different, if only in that she’d managed it without any kind of artificial assistance.</p><p class="double">Applebloom hadn’t stopped laughing since Scootaloo had landed, except to point out between giggles that it was <i>so </i>typically Scootaloo to have no idea how to keep an aircraft in one piece.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo <i>had</i> tried to protest, but the engineer-filly had reminded her of at least three separate planes that had simply fallen to bits around her thanks to overzealous straining of the airframe.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle came to Scootaloo’s rescue. “Hey, ‘bloom? You do realize she’s completely stolen the show this time around?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom stopped laughing. “Aw… shucks.”</p><p class="double">“So,” Sweetie added, determined to get them all back to normal, “you going to repeat this way of getting your cutie mark?”</p><p class="double">“No!” Scootaloo replied, eyes twitching. “Not without at least two different kinds of safety gear.”</p><p class="double">“What, a helmet and shinpads?” ‘bloom snarked.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo considered it. “I was thinking more along the lines of the world’s biggest trampoline and a Pinkie Promise not to get hurt.”</p><p class="double">“…actually, that might do it,” Applebloom admitted.</p><p class="double">“Hey, this gives me an idea for a song!” Sweetie said.</p><p class="double">Grateful for the return to normalcy, both of the others threw pillows at her.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">“…she did <i>what?</i>” Twilight asked. “No, I did hear you. I just didn’t believe you were that irresponsible.”</p><p class="double">Dash looked down. “Sorry, ‘twi. I was going to ascend to save her if I had to.”</p><p class="double">“I don’t doubt it.” Twilight tried a smile. “Just… careful, okay? Not everypony is as tough as you.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus nodded.</p><p class="double">Then her eyes widened, and she kicked the wall. “Oh, <i>buck!</i> I should have lent her my Element!”</p><p class="double">“Would that have worked?” Twilight asked, more to herself than anything. “I would have thought the cutie mark had to be established… oh, well.”</p><p class="double">Getting out a notebook, she wrote something in it. “You know this is one of the first times any Crusader has got a cutie mark based entirely off of in-loop actions? I mean, they’ve got ones before, but usually either when not Awake or when in a Loop somehow different to normal.”</p><p class="double">“Or they’ve made it a loop different to normal by building an aircraft or something…” Dash muttered. “Which is more or less what happened anyway.”</p><p class="double">“True, true…” Twilight acknowledged. “Okay, I think this one’s going to be a friendship lesson. By the end of the week, please.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus groaned. “Not again!”</p><p class="double">“Well, you <i>have</i> been a bit crazy these last few loops… perhaps you need to let some steam off…” Twilight frowned. “Wonder when the next giant robot loop is?”</p><p><hr></p><p>26.6</p><p class="double">“So,” Spike said, lying back in the warm sunlight of a new Loop’s second day, “what should we do this time?”</p><p class="double">“Not sure, really…” Rarity replied, trotting over with a huge towel. She laid it down next to him, making sure it completely covered the grass, then flopped down on it. Obligingly, Spike raised an arm and pulled the edge of the towel under his side.</p><p class="double">“Hmmm…” the dragon pondered for a moment. “Fancy a world tour?”</p><p class="double">“That might be nice.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Spike said, grinning. “I’d only suggested it for a bit of a laugh – are you sure it’s fine?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Rarity winked. “Just give me a day or so to set the shop up.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Ready?” Spike checked.</p><p class="double">“Of course.” The unicorn nodded down the road. “Come on – Manehattan awaits!”</p><p class="double">“Out of curiosity,” Spike said, as they got going – Loopers could travel light with the best of them, using their subspace pockets to hold luggage easily – “how <i>did</i> you get the shop set up?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I blagged an EMH off of Twilight. You know, the virtual doctor things from the Star Trek place. No AI,” she shrugged, “but it should be quite sufficient with a little reprogramming.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Hello?” the stallion said, looking nervous. “This is the Carousel Boutique, right?”</p><p class="double">With a flash, a unicorn mare appeared in front of him. Her face was composed, and she wasn’t quite focusing on him.</p><p class="double"><b>“Please state the nature of your fashion disaster.”</b></p><p class="double">“Er… well, I’m getting married tomorrow, and I don’t have a tuxedo-”</p><p class="double">The unicorn vanished. There was a shuffling sound from the back room, and then she reappeared in another flash of light.</p><p class="double">In her hooves was a neatly packaged suit.</p><p class="double"><b>“Price noted on the package. Please leave your details and feedback.”</b></p><p class="double">Feeling quite thoroughly creeped out, the stallion left his name, address and the money and left as fast as he could.</p><p class="double">The suit fitted perfectly.</p><p><hr></p><p>26.7</p><p class="double">“What is the meaning of this?” Blueblood said, looking down at a rather scruffy earth pony stallion. “Where is your ticket?”</p><p class="double">“I told you, I don’t <i>have</i> one,” the stallion replied. “Look, I never expected to need one, but-”</p><p class="double">“But me no buts!” Blueblood shook his head. “This is an invitation <i>only</i> event, and I do not intend to see the wedding of my cousin and her fiancé marred by any old nag off the street!”</p><p class="double">“Look, Blueblood, it’s me!” The stallion’s eyes pleaded. “I don’t know where my horn went, but it’s me. Shining Armor.”</p><p class="double">“Tosh!” Blueblood turned up his nose. “Captain Armor is a unicorn of great distinction and rather good breeding. You are some earth pony with a similar cutie mark, trying to con your way into the palace. Guards!”</p><p class="double">“What’s going on?” Cadence’s voice came from the direction of the grounds. “Is it Shiny? He’s ever so late, the sun’s gone down.”</p><p class="double">“It’s me, Cadence!” the stallion shouted, before Blueblood threw a silencing spell at him.</p><p class="double">Cadence flew over the last fence in the way with a little fluttering hop and slowed to a stop, eyes wide. “Oh!”</p><p class="double">“Please, cousin,” Blueblood’s tone softened. “I’m sorry all this hassle is affecting your wedding day, but this is just some tramp who tried to get into the palace under false pretences. Once this is sorted out, then I can see if I can find the Captain. I should have tried sooner.”</p><p class="double">“No,” Cadence said, her voice hitching and close to tears. “You’re wrong, cousin.”</p><p class="double">Her eyes met those of the stallion. “This <i>is</i> Shining Armor. I’d know him anywhere.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood’s reaction to that was, perhaps fortunately, composed of a coughing fit rather than words.</p><p class="double">“What happened to you, love?” she asked softly.</p><p class="double">Shining tried to speak, but no sound came out. After a moment, Cadence snapped the thread of Blueblood’s silence spell and he started in on the explanation.</p><p class="double">“It’s a curse,” he said, his clear voice carrying. “By night one way, by day another; this shall be the norm. Until you find true love’s first kiss; then, take love’s true form.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, Shining…” Cadence looked at him for a second longer, then darted forwards and kissed him.</p><p class="double">All the spectators covered their eyes against the blinding flash of light.</p><p class="double">“…huh,” Shining said after a moment, looking down the barrel of his body. “I don’t remember the wings from before.”</p><p class="double">Cadence sniffed. “You were always a prince in my eyes.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“…plagarists,” Trixie muttered, as the moonlit wedding finally got under way.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hush,” Twilight said, eating some popcorn. “So what if they stole the plot of Shrek?”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">26.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had a BRILLIANT plan this loop. She&#039;d filled her friends in on it, arranged various spell matrices in the Everfree, and just managed to get back in time for the summer sun celebration. On cue, Nightmare Moon appeared, looking down at the crowd of ponies and going into her speech.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now, the night! Will last! Forever!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked internally, opening her mouth--</p><p class="double">&quot;I wouldn&#039;t be doing that mate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">A strange brown stallion, mane and beard tied up in dreadlocks and beads, swaggered forward. He was wearing a roughshod sort of jacket and a ratty old tricorn, eyeing Nightmare Moon lazily. The goddess of the night gazed down at him dismissively.</p><p class="double">&quot;And who are <i>you</i> to oppose me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, nonono. Not opposing the night thing, really. I&#039;m just a humble sailor, stumbled into port for the Summer.... set thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...We&#039;re landlocked.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See, that&#039;s the problem. I&#039;m completely lost.&quot; The stallion waved around vaguely, half stumbling. &quot;Sailor, use the stars to navigate. Love those things, by the way, great lil&#039; pinpricks of light in the sky.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot; Rainbow whispered, &quot;should we do something?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shook her head slightly. &quot;I want to see how this goes...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! So you admit the virtue of the night!&quot; Nightmare Moon stamped a hoof. &quot;Thank you, noble sailor. Now then--&quot;&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you see the problem is... if it&#039;s night here, then what&#039;s it out at sea?&quot; The stallion held up a hoof. &quot;Not. Not night. Thing of it is, if you&#039;re out at sea and it&#039;s day, you&#039;re completely lost. Less you find land. But that only ensures you&#039;re a little less lost, less you find a map. You need a lot more equipment when it&#039;s not night, then when it&#039;s night. You see? I love the eternal night, but put it here, land locked, and when I get out to port I&#039;m not going to be able to see the stars, lass.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked. &quot;I... see thy reasoning, I suppose. Still--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Here&#039;s an idea. Let&#039;s make eternal night mobile.&quot; By now, the stallion had somehow stumbled onto the stage. &quot;You and me, and all us night lovers, we go round the sea. And all the day lovers stay here, on dry land, and grow things. Then, when we get hungry, we walk up, take what we can, and sail off.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thou refers to piracy!&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion considered her words. &quot;Hmm. Yes, I think that is the right word.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why would we engage in such acts against those whom we wish respect from?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why wouldn&#039;t you? I mean, isn&#039;t that what you&#039;re doing now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon looked genuinely shocked. &quot;No!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, so you&#039;re not asking for tribute?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No! Of course not!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, sorry then. I think I misinterpreted things.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Carry on with your hostile takeover, by all means.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tried hard to keep her face straight.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon gave the stallion a long, strange look.</p><p class="double">He tilted his head.</p><p class="double">She snorted, and turned back to the now quite bemused ponies. &quot;As we were saying, the night <i>will</i> last forever--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, I just realized something.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn growled, whirling on him. &quot;What?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think, maybe, the night lasts forever anyway. I mean, the moon keeps moving, and the sun keeps moving, and really the only difference is which is in the sky. So keeping the moon where it is sort of seems redundant to me. Of course, I&#039;m just a very lost sailor. Could be wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Twilight offered politely, &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;re right.&quot; She got a brown hoof wave.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what I&#039;m thinking is, keeping night here means that everybody else in the world, they end up not getting night. That doesn&#039;t seem fair to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon stared at him as if he was insane.</p><p class="double">&quot;Show of hands! Sorry. Show of hooves, who here thinks that the night is too wonderful to keep locked on one place?&quot;</p><p class="double">Everypony in the hall shot up a hoof, Pinkie flipping over so all of hers could dangle upward. Nightmare Moon choked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, see, all these ponies love night so much, they want to share it... with the world. So, back to my original suggestion. Keep the eternal night, but keep it moving. Savvy?&quot;</p><p class="double">The black alicorn stared at him. &quot;But... that&#039;s just the same thing as what there was before!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it?&quot; He blinked, glanced up at the sky, and turned back to her. &quot;I hadn&#039;t noticed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even Twilight wasn&#039;t sure if the stallion was being sarcastic.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon held up a hoof, trying to formulate an argument, but her mouth merely opened and shut in confusion. Finally, staring out at the crowd, she released a frustrated scream. &quot;FINE! Moving eternal night it is! But we&#039;re going to be watching closely and if we don&#039;t see proper respect for the night, we are going to stick Celestia back in the sun!&quot; With a flash of her horn, she was gone, and a moment later Celestia stepped onto the stage slightly confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.... hum. Well. That was... not... expected...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I rarely am, love.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehooved. Okay, time to host an intervention. Her horn glowed, teleporting the stallion and herself into the library; she had to figure out what the hay was going on.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...so this is your first time outside your home loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose it is.&quot; Jack shrugged. &quot;Leastways, this don&#039;t look like anywhere in the Caribbean. I take it you&#039;ve never heard of Davy Jones?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. Well, welcome to Equestria, enjoy your stay, and if you do anything to destabilize or threaten the world I teleport you straight to the moon.&quot; Twilight smirked. &quot;Other then that, you&#039;re pretty much free to do whatever, mister...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sparrow Jack.&quot; He blinked and shook his head. &quot;No, wait. Jack Sparrow. Captain. Captain Jack Sparrow.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A pleasure to meet you captain. Oh, since it is your first time out of your loop, you&#039;ll need the Welcome to the multiverse speech. Oh I&#039;m so excited, this is my frist time giving it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Jack Sparrow suddenly felt a sinking feeling. </p><p><hr></p><p>26.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight woke up over a dead mouse. And realized part of it was in her.... beak?</p><p class="double">Okay so... owl, apparently. Alright, sure. Loop memories... this was still Equestria. Heck, she was in the Everfree forest...</p><p class="double">A suspicion rose up in her mind and she took to wing, headed for Ponyville.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah swear if you make any sort of pun Ah will punt you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity scoffed. &quot;My word, Applejack, do I look like the sort of feline that would make light of another&#039;s situation? I am a refined lady.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmdog nodded, managing a wry smile. &quot;Ah guess ya are... should be on the lookout fer Rainbow though. Wait a minute, if we&#039;re the pets this loop, then Rainbow--&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.&quot; Rainbow let out an irritated sigh. Twilight was a short distance away, hooting with laughter and rolling on the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, now,&quot; Fluttershy tried, &quot;It&#039;s not nice of you to laugh at Rainbow&#039;s expense Twi. After all, it... hee... she can&#039;t help that she&#039;s... hee hee... so slow!&quot; The rabbit tried and failed to hold back her own giggles.</p><p class="double">Dash looked between her two friends. Eventually, she just rolled her eyes and pulled back into her shell. &quot;Wake me up when Angel comes round to feed us.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie looked in the mirror.</p><p class="double">&quot;...well. Bright pink gator. This is one for the record books.&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; the bearer of Kindness asked his pet tortoise.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash nodded, snapping the goggles over her eyes and checking the straps on her prismatic shell.</p><p class="double">Tank let out a sigh, double checking the machinery once again before finally nodding. &quot;Alright then. Tortoise take off in ten.&quot; He backed off, ready to catch her with his magic should anything go wrong.</p><p class="double">Blades started to whirl, cutting the air with a powerful rumble as the various propellers attached to Dash kicked into gear. Soon enough, the only thing holding her to the ground were the metal struts clinging to the contraption. Tank took a breath, lighting his horn and sliding them away slowly.</p><p class="double">As soon as she was free, Rainbow bolted into the air, spiraling and twirling on her magitech glider jet copter thing and letting out a scream of pure joy. Rainbow Dash, fastest tortoise on the ground, was now once again the fastest thing in the air.</p><p class="double">The air over Ponyville, anyway. Even Tank&#039;s mechanical brilliance wasn&#039;t quite enough to give her supersonic speed. Yet.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d painted the contraption blue with yellow bolts, much to Tank&#039;s amusement. And by Celestia she was going to ensure that she made it.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah thought Ah was the pet in this relationship,&quot; Applejack grumbled to herself. But she couldn&#039;t help but smile as Winona emerged from a pile of apples and tumbled down to her paws. &quot;Come on, ya klutz, ya still need to get to the other trees.&quot;</p><p class="double">Winona didn&#039;t understand her, of course--well, she didn&#039;t understand what Applejack was <i>saying</i>, but the way she pointed toward the rest of the orchard with an orange paw communicated her intent clearly enough. &quot;Oh come on, you silly mutt, I&#039;m dog tired! Maybe I should go see if anypony&#039;s willing to lend a hoof.&quot; Her face scrunched up. &quot;On second thought, no, that would be GROSS. I&#039;ll just ask for their help.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack let out a whuffling chuckle. &quot;No wonder you got Laughter. That sounds like a right fine idea, girl, let&#039;s go corral us some ponies.&quot; Winona bounced up, beginning to walk off before Applejack bit down on her tail. &quot;AFTER you get all these apples into buckets, girl!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ow! Hey! Down dog!&quot; Winona turned around. &quot;What is it? What&#039;s wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">The orange mutt sighed, pointing at the apples.</p><p class="double">&quot;....you want to play fetch?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack facepawed.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Gummy....</p><p class="double">Gummy was a strange one. Everypony in Ponyville knew this. Yes, he gave freely, and often exactly what was needed. Heck, he was even the bearer of generosity! And yet....</p><p class="double">Some said it was his eyes. Some said it was his vacant expression. Some said it was the way the earth pony moved so silently, you couldn&#039;t hear his hoofsteps on hard cobble. Some, quietly, blamed the genetic quirk that prevented him from growing teeth and made the rare sound of his voice an oddity, though they would never say it out loud.</p><p class="double">All in all, something was... off about that pony. How did he know what you needed? Why did he crop up when you needed him, and just as suddenly disappear? Where did he get the stuff he gave, what was his job anyway? Yes, he hung out with his &quot;friends,&quot; but... he would smile, frown, and never open his mouth. Never even to eat! Although, given the tooth thing maybe he was just embarrassed.</p><p class="double">Strangest of all was his hot-pink alligator. She couldn&#039;t talk. No. She <i>sang.</i> And danced, but any animal could do that. The toothy grin almost permanent on her face was somehow heartwarming and endearing and not at all predatory. On occasion she even played with young foals; even stranger, if the parents got worried and tried to stop her she would nod and walk away, calmly, as if she understood.</p><p class="double">They were an odd pair, Gummy and Pinkie Pie, and nopony really quite understood them.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Opalescence smiled gratefully as Rarity brought up the appropriate gems. &quot;Thank you, darling. You&#039;ve quite a good taste, I wish I could make you an outfit.&quot; She sighed. &quot;If only you didn&#039;t have such long fur... Ah, well. Back to pleasing the idiots in Canterlot.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Should I take offense to that?&quot;</p><p class="double">The white unicorn turned to the brown pegasus walking in through the boutique door. &quot;You&#039;re not in Canterlot anymore, you&#039;re not an idiot at all, and I doubt princess Philomena would disagree with my assessment of the nobles... so I&#039;m going to say no. Why are you here, Owly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just warning you there&#039;s going to be a storm Tuesday.&quot; The pegasus shrugged. &quot;I wasn&#039;t aware if you had any important meetings, but I know that impressions are important.&quot;</p><p class="double">Opalescence nodded at him thankfully. &quot;I&#039;ll be sure to have a day in then. Thanks for the heads up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Part of Honesty is facts, and I felt I would be denying my element if I left you uninformed.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a mild chuckle out of her. &quot;Honestly, you try too hard. You don&#039;t see me casting spells left and right. By the way, could you tell Peewee his phoenix has been sneaking over here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Certainly. Has there been any issues?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, no, not exactly.&quot; The unicorn shuddered. &quot;It&#039;s just.... I... I think I spotted him making out with Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus raised a thick eyebrow. &quot;Truly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know what she sees in him--purple and green feathers, so gauche! And apart from that, she&#039;s a cat and he&#039;s a bird.&quot; Opal shuddered. &quot;Still, I guess I can&#039;t actually stop them without spaying her. Not going to do that. Angel gets really aggressive about things like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm, yes. Cloudsdale culture can do that. Very well, I&#039;ll try to get Peewee to reign Spike in, but I doubt he&#039;ll do it.&quot; Owly shook his head. &quot;That young dragon.... why did I EVER hatch him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You wanted an intellectual challenge and didn&#039;t actually expect your methods to work,&quot; Opal deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yes. Hmm. Oh, have you seen Twilight anywhere? She&#039;s been missing for a couple of days.&quot;</p><p class="double">Opal shrugged. &quot;No clue. Go see if Angel knows anything. The only owl I understand is you.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Actually, aren&#039;t you up a little early? It&#039;s not even evening yet!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh har de har har. One week of all nighters and you never live it down.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked up.</p><p class="double">&quot;....so. Let me see if I understand this. You wanted to see if the alicornification spell worked on an owl.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now....&quot; She gestured. &quot;You&#039;re an owlbear.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rubbed one of her antlers awkwardly. &quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...How. How does this even make sense?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... I&#039;m still part owl?&quot; The violet giant giggled awkwardly and cringed. &quot;I can fix this, I think. I just need a few things.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy sighed, tugging at her long ears. &quot;I&#039;ll go see if I can sneak something from Angel for you. What is it you need?&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p>26.10 (misterq)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up in a comfortable bedroom and waited until the memories hit. She was human this loop, and very young. Her name was Tai Lee and she was just about to start fourth grade at Ponneville Magical Elementary School along with her friends, Jacqueline Apple-Smyth, Bonnie Dash, Felicia Shai, Rarity Belle, and... and...</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Mina Diane &#039;Pinkie&#039; Pie woke up on a train with a huge grin on her face. Her parents were drilling experts working for BP who had recently transferred to the London division. That meant that she was going to Hogwarts! On one hand she was going to miss all her friends, but on the other hand, she had never had a solo Hogwarts loop before. Also she had hands again now. They always made her giggle. Like five tiny legs on the end of a longer leg.</p><p class="double">Neville opened a compartment of a train only to see a strange girl with light red hair giggling while wiggling her fingers. Mustering up what courage he had, he attempted to get her attention, &quot;Um, hello. My name is Neville. Have.. have you seen a toad around here? He may answer to the name, Trevor. I&#039;m afraid mine seems to have run away.&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl whirled her head towards him and grinned in a wide, and somewhat disturbing manner, &quot;Hi Neville! My name is Pinkie Pie. Actually it&#039;s Mina Diane Pie, but everyone just calls me Pinkie Pie. Don&#039;t worry about your toad. Gummy and I will help you look!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, thank you,&quot; the young wizards was having second thoughts about asking this girl for help.</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem!&quot; Pinkie said and whipped out a small alligator from somewhere, and held it in both hands, &quot;Gummy, find Trevor!&quot;</p><p class="double">The alligator just sat there in her grip, only slowly wagging his tail.</p><p class="double">&quot;This way!&quot; The girl jumped up and ran out of the compartment. Neville followed cautiously and with growing dread.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Godric Gryffindor had created the sorting hat with more than a few secrets. One of them was a result of him trying to figure out a way of dealing with children who were advanced enough to have trained their minds to be unreadable by said hat. The quickest way he solved this problem was to make the hat automatically sort anyone who it couldn&#039;t read into his house. In addition to getting talented children who had been skilled in controlling their own minds, this little feature would result, over the years, in Gryffindor getting a half-giant boy who would otherwise gone to Hufflepuff, and a werewolf who would have been a shoo-in for Ravenclaw.</p><p class="double">So when Pinkie Pie put on the sorting hat, it just yelled out &#039;Gryffindor&#039; and automatically rebooted itself from the sugar mind-induced magical blue screen of death. She quickly ran down and sat next to Neville at the table. They had found Trevor in minutes. After Pinkie introduced the terrified toad to her alligator, she had declared herself and Neville to be best friends in Hogwarts, whether the boy wanted to be or not. Then, she had proceeded to buy and eat most of the candy that was left on the snack cart. Neville had a feeling it was going to be a very long, very interesting year.</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;You have to calm down,&quot; Applejack told Twilight, &quot;I&#039;m sure Pinkie is going to be fine on her lonesome.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked over her remaining awakened friends who were all gathered together at the school library, &quot;I&#039;m not worried about that. Do you remember what happened the last time Pinkie had a solo loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack answered, &quot;She turned out just fine. Grew wings and a horn, if I recall correctly.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity paled, &quot;I don&#039;t think that is what Twilight is getting at. The last time Pinkie was left alone, she became the chaos goddess of joy and celebration for the entire galaxy. And then there was the time the non-awake version of her became an alicorn princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now she is all alone in the corrupt an nasty English wizarding world,&quot; Fluttershy spoke up, &quot;It&#039;s not nearly as horrible as that loop&#039;s universe, but it is still pretty bad.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash asked with slight confusion, &quot;So wait. You&#039;re saying that we don&#039;t have to go save Pinkie from the English magical world. We have to go save the English magical world from Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded as vigorously as an eleven year old girl could, &quot;Yes. Although it may already be too late.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie sat in a small corner of the bathroom with her arms wrapped around her legs. Her long hair was over her eyes and she was trying not to cry. Of course, she realized that she now had the emotional stability of an eleven year old girl. So when Ron Weasely told her that she was extremely annoying and that no one wanted to come to her far too frequent parties, it had hurt far, far more than it should. </p><p class="double">Sure, she could go all alicorn party goddess on this loop, but she had the feeling that would end it immediately, and she was kind of enjoying learning human magic. </p><p class="double">So when she heard the sound of the bathroom door locking and looked up into the face of an angry troll, she knew she had to take care of this Pinkie Pie style.</p><p class="double">Harry Potter and Ron quickly unlocked the door after racing back up the stairs to the second floor bathroom. It took them a while to realize that they locked the troll in with their classmate and hoped that the fact that there was no screaming didn&#039;t mean that something horrible had happened.</p><p class="double">All their preconceived notions vanished when the door opened. Inside, they beheld a party.</p><p class="double">Balloons and streamers were everywhere. A large partially eaten feast was prepared to one side and a massive banner proclaimed in large letters &#039;Welcome to Hogwarts, Mr. Troll&#039;.</p><p class="double">On the other side of the large bathroom, was a large smelly troll who was currently using his club to play a giant magically reinforced game of whack-a-mole. Idly, Harry noticed that that one of the moles popping up resembled a certain potion professor. It was also worth double the points according to the increasing floating numbers designating the troll&#039;s score. Pinkie Pie was using pom-poms to cheer him on. </p><p class="double">Then she noticed the two boys. </p><p class="double">&quot;See? Not everyone thinks my super fun parties are annoying. Isn&#039;t that right, Mister Thok?&quot;</p><p class="double">The troll, Mr. Thok apparently, nodded and gave a happy grunting noise as he clobbered the Snape-looking whack-a-mole with a club slam that shook the floor a little.</p><p class="double">It turns out that fear and awe of an insistent little girl that could control trolls could also be basis for a lasting friendship.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was just about ready to teleport the gang over to England on a rescue mission when an owl holding an alligator holding a letter appeared outside her window. The girl slowly and cautiously let them into her room. The very familiar alligator opened its mouth and dropped the letter on her bed before the two flew into her bathroom and closed the door. Soon, there was a sound of her bathtub being filled with water.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what does it say?&quot; Applejack tore Twilight&#039;s attention back towards the envelope.</p><p class="double">Twilight carefully picked up the letter, opened it, and began to read.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Hello, friends! This is Pinkie Pie! Hopefully you are all &#039;awake&#039; and bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not that we actually have tails anymore, bushy or otherwise, although I&#039;m working on that. I don&#039;t know if you all want to come and rescue me from the spooky haunted super magic castle, but I am having tons of fun here learning magic. Most of it even works for me. Well, some of it does.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m no expert, but the fact that I still have earth pony magic and chaos goddess magic running through me, somehow, makes the normal magic I&#039;m trying to learn act all kooky strange. The way I understand it is that it isn&#039;t like plugging a DC device into a wall socket with no converter, but more like prying open the battery case and stuffing it full of waldorf salad, hot lava, and magical amulets; then hoping for the best.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Half the time, my spells work just fine. A quarter of the time, they work, but are either way too powerful or barely powerful enough. And the last quarter of the time, strange things happen. The professors are still trying to figure out how I turned a regular feather into a giant angry unkillable purple tentacle plant that was also on fire.</i></p><p class="double"><i>They say that that part of the castle will be safe in another few days or so. A week at most.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Our transfiguration teacher turned into a human from being a cat, but then lied and said &#039;no&#039; when I asked if she was a moon cat. I don&#039;t know who her magical girl is, but I will find out soon. She was also unhappy that when she turned her desk into a piggy, only I was quick enough to be able to ride it out of the room and into the hallway.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Oh, in other news. I threw a party for a Mr. Thok, who is a giant troll. After some translation from Rubeus Hagrid, who is a vary large hairy man that lives alone in a wooden shed not far from where we kids go to school; Principal Dumbledore just decided to extract Mr. Thok&#039;s memories and then threw them into a big bowl. Then he tried to play apple-bobbing, but with memories instead of apples. Then he got really mad and chased Professor Quirrell out of the school.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ron, who is a boy in my house and my new friend, asked me to not have so many parties. I happily agreed. Then I met with his brothers, who are twins and love pranks of all sorts. We came up with so many good ideas. So many. I&#039;ll try to record some of the good ones so you can see them, Dashie.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ron was upset at me when he thought that Gummy ate his missing rat, Scabbers. But I told him that Gummy has no teeth and that I would get him another pet that is much better than his old rat. I&#039;m mixing up several batches of polyjuice potion right now. Not sure what I&#039;ll get when I mix bits of every magical animal I can find together and then feed it to the giant freshwater squid, but it has got to be better than a boring old rat, right?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Don&#039;t worry, the ingredients were super easy to get with the Potions teacher in the hospital. They say something shredded his mind real bad. I have no idea what it was, but I think it tried to get me too because right before he collapsed all twitchy and foamy at the mouth, I had a brief headache. I think it was some kind of invisible mind ghost, but I laughed at it and it hasn&#039;t bothered me since.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Actually those last parts happened around Halloween, which is three months from now. And I think Gummy should now be done with his bath. In ending, hope everything is fine with all of you. Don&#039;t come &#039;rescue&#039; me. I&#039;ll write you guys another letter when a good time to go visit would be.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Toodles,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Pinkie Pie.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">When Twilight finished talking, the owl swooped out of the bathroom carrying the newly cleaned alligator. The alligator opened his mouth and a giant red swirling portal formed in front of the two animals, closing quickly once the two flew inside.</p><p class="double">For a moment, no one spoke. Then Applejack stood up and calmly put her hat on her head, &quot;See. I told you she was fine. Everything is fine. I&#039;m going to go home now and pretend really hard that magical Pinkie Pie is farther than only half the world away. Goodnight, all.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>27.1</p><p class="double">“All the cakes have been sabotaged!” Pinkie gasped. “I know just what to do!”</p><p class="double">The others looked at her sceptically. “Really?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” She pulled a clockwork pigeon from her mane, slotted in a key, and wound it up. After a few turns, she lifted it to her mouth and spoke slowly and clearly. “I need your help. Come quick.”</p><p class="double">The earth pony trotted briskly to the window and threw the pigeon out.</p><p class="double">It flew exactly as well as a dense lump of metal would be expected to fly, bounced off the gravel, and exploded into a cloud of gears and springs.</p><p class="double">“You rang?” Discord asked, coming through a trapdoor in the floor.</p><p class="double">Pinkie clapped her hooves. “I knew that would get your attention!”</p><p class="double">“Actually, you were just passing by. I was having a sleep.”</p><p class="double">“Where?” Gustav asked, looking out the window. “There is not any lights for miles…”</p><p class="double">“The sleepers, duh.” Discord turned to Pinkie. “So, what’s up?”</p><p class="double">“Someone’s been eating the cakes!” Pinkie said, pointing. “That one, and that one, and those two.”</p><p class="double">The chaotic draconequus snapped his fingers and materialized a magnifying glass, deerstalker hat and bubble pipe.</p><p class="double">“No, sorry…” Pinkie shook her head. “We already did that one.”</p><p class="double">Discord looked downcast. “What about if I speak in zee foreign accent, like zee great Parrot?”</p><p class="double">A rolling pin bounced off his head.</p><p class="double">“I think Gustave finds it offensive.” Pinkie retrieved the rolling pin and passed it back to him. “Eight out of ten for accuracy, but only a six for force.”</p><p class="double">Discord got out a long list. “Hmmm… magical private eye?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight did that one.”</p><p class="double">“Secret agent?”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Joe answered, then paled. “Oh, what a giveaway!”</p><p class="double">Getting out his magnifying glass again, Discord perused the list. Having a quick peek, Mulia was none the wiser. “List of mystery plot protagonist stereotypes? What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p class="double">Discord glanced over the paper at her. “And so much for ninja, as well. Right, that’s it, I’m completely out of stereotypes. They’ve all been done.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie passed him a PADD. “What about the hacker?”</p><p class="double">“…I was just testing you,” he said unconvincingly, and pulled a cord out of the back of the PADD. “Right…”</p><p class="double">He typed on the little computer seemingly at random, occasionally saying things like ‘disabling code walls’ or ‘hacking all IPs simultaneously.’.</p><p class="double">Eventually, he held it up triumphantly. “I have it! It was the butler!”</p><p class="double">Everyone else on the train gave him a <i>look.</i></p><p class="double">“…fine, then, don’t trust the hacker.” Discord snapped his fingers, and the damage to the cakes was repaired. “Right, I’m going back to my nap.”</p><p class="double">Opening the trapdoor again to reveal a long set of spiral stairs, he walked down them muttering and was out of sight.</p><p class="double">Mulia shook her head. “Did that just happen?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “Hey, we got our cakes back, right?”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.2</p><p class="double">Cadence trotted over to the door. “Coming!”</p><p class="double">When it creaked open, she saw one of the palace maids standing there.</p><p class="double">Her eyes narrowed, then widened. “Oh, you poor thing! Shining, come here!”</p><p class="double">The unicorn cantered over. “What is it, dear?”</p><p class="double">“The poor thing’s starving, look!” Cadence pointed to the maid, who was now looking a little confused. “Can we help her?”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know…” Shining said, dubiously.</p><p class="double">“Please?” Cadence did her best puppy-eyes.</p><p class="double">Shining gave in. “Alright, dear. You know best.”</p><p class="double">She nibbled his mane affectionately, then they touched horns. A brief pulse of bright pink magic flared up, and the maid collapsed.</p><p class="double">A moment later, there was a crackle of green energy, and Queen Chrysalis lay revealed and blinking up at them. “What…”</p><p class="double">“That should do you for a bit,” Cadence said with a smile. “We’ll get you sorted out with more love later on, but for now you need a bit of rest.”</p><p class="double">The ruler of the Changelings thought about that.</p><p class="double"><i>Eh, may as well go along with it.</i></p><p><hr></p><p>27.3</p><p class="double">“Hm…” the mouse said, squinting up at Twilight. “I’m afraid you’re a little… big to fit in the door.”</p><p class="double">Twilight examined it. “I think I could squeeze in… but you’re right, best not to risk it.”</p><p class="double">“I’ll get the cooks to send you out food, then.” The young mouse lay back on the springy roadside grass, looking up at her. “By the way… would you mind helping us with what comes up next in our Loop?”</p><p class="double">“Not at all,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“Good.” A chuckle. “Cluny’s still kind of a threat – he’s hardly an idiot, and getting together all the bits of Martin’s armour isn’t as safe as it could be – but since the biggest defender we normally have is a badger…”</p><p class="double">After a short pause, Matthias looked up again. “How are you at puzzles?”</p><p class="double">“I’m alright.” Twilight shrugged. “I don’t often get new ones, to be honest, which is a bit of a pain.”</p><p class="double">“You’ll like our Loop, then. Hold on a minute, I’ll write down the first one we normally run into. It’s hidden in the great hall.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled as the mouse scampered off. He seemed quite a pleasant fellow… although everyone here was so small compared to her that it was setting off Fluttershy-Squee responses.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">27.4</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the door, and the Crusaders looked up from their card game. “Come in!”</p><p class="double">The door creaked, admitting a black filly in a cloak. “Hi, everypony, Twilight said you were all – wait, what’s she doing here?”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara stared. “What are <i>you</i> doing in here?”</p><p class="double">“I asked first!” The filly stamped a hoof and stuck her tongue out. “So there.”</p><p class="double">“Should we do something?” Applebloom asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“Nah,” Scootaloo replied, putting her cards down face-down. “I’ll go make some milkshakes.”</p><p class="double">“I am Diamond Tiara,” the earth pony said, posing briefly. “I was invited. Officially, and everything.”</p><p class="double">“Seriously?” The filly shot a pitying look at Sweetie Belle. Then turned back to Diamond. “Wait, why did you <i>accept?</i>”</p><p class="double">“I answered your question,” Diamond replied, pointing. “Now you answer mine.”</p><p class="double">“I’m a Crusader as well!” The filly turned, showing off her cloak. “See?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’ve never met you.”</p><p class="double">“Look, are you guys Looping or not? ‘cause now I’m wondering if this is a bizarre alternate Equestria…”</p><p class="double">“This is coming from you?” Sweetie asked, and the filly blushed.</p><p class="double">“We <i>are</i> looping,” Applebloom said. “All four of us.”</p><p class="double">“…oh.” With a flap of wings that had been hidden under the cloak, the newcomer revealed herself to be an alicorn. “Hi, then, I’m Nyx. I’m kinda Princess Luna’s dark-but-not-evil side, it’s complicated. Sorry I reacted so badly, I once nearly got et by monsters ‘cause of a different version of you.”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.” Diamond shrugged. “I hope to show I’ve learned my lesson.”</p><p class="double">Nyx gaped. “Seriously, guys, is this an alternate universe version of Diamond Tiara? This is really confusing me. No offence.”</p><p class="double">“Some taken,” the pink filly replied.</p><p class="double">Sweetie and Applebloom exchanged looks. “Was that a seven?”</p><p class="double">“Eight!” Scootaloo shouted from the kitchen area, and came over balancing five milkshakes on hooves, wings and forehead. “…can somepony take these, please? I didn’t give nearly enough thought how to get them down again.”</p><p class="double">Nyx and Sweetie lifted some down, passed one on to each earth pony, and sat down with their own.</p><p class="double">“So…” Diamond said, awkwardly, “tell me how it is that you, er… exist.”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Nyx replied, “when an evil cult and a dark goddess love each other very much, and then they fluff a magic ritual designed to resurrect the evil goddess by using the blood of Momma – that’s Twilight Sparkle – they get a ball of fluff and feathers with no memory of her past life. That’s me. And then I got raised by Twilight for, like, a month or so, before the evil cult brought back my memories of being evil.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom cut in. “Yeah, a thousand years of evil rage ain’t much compared to a month of talkin’ to Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Pre-tty much.” Nyx looked down. “This is really good milkshake. Anyway, took over the world, didn’t feel like it, gave the world back, and then ‘cause of super luck I got Looping. I don’t turn up much, but I can’t complain.”</p><p class="double">Diamond nodded along. “Yeah, that’s about the second strangest thing I’ve ever heard.”</p><p class="double">“Second?” Nyx asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“Jewel Scouts,” all the others chorused.</p><p class="double">“…yeah, I’ll ask later. Hey, what game are you playing?”</p><p class="double">“It’s called Chaos. Discord gave it to us for playtesting.” Applebloom picked up her cards, and blinked. “I could swear I had a different set of cards five minutes ago.”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.5</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we are,” Twilight said, ushering the other five Elements in. “This is our new headquarters.”</p><p class="double">They looked around the single large room. There was a large projector on the ceiling, a complex mess of scientific equipment at one corner, and three sets of double doors leading off the central area.</p><p class="double">“Well, it looks nice…” Rarity said, with a moue of distaste for the furnishings. “I assume I can touch it up a bit?”</p><p class="double">“Feel free,” Twilight replied. “Now, this is the pantry.”</p><p class="double">Trotting smartly over to the first set of double doors on the north wall, she opened them to reveal a vast, cavernous room with dozens of aisles of freezers and cupboards. It looked like there was enough food in there to feed them for three years.</p><p class="double">“Where do we prepare it, then?” Pinkie asked. “There better be a good kitchen!”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled, and opened the second set of doors – the east wall – to reveal a kitchen that could cater for a hotel.</p><p class="double">“Wait, wait…” Dash frowned. “Food is cool, but what about… you know.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to the doors on the west wall. “Through there is the bathroom, showers, toilets, hot tub, spa and swimming pool.”</p><p class="double">The others looked at her with confusion. “Hold on a minute,” Applejack said, voicing their thoughts, “Where do we sleep?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave a mysterious smile and opened the north doors, revealing a much larger version of her own bedroom. Closing the doors and opening them again, this time an enlarged version of Dash’s room was revealed.</p><p class="double">With gradually dropping jaws, the Elements watched as Twilight opened the three double doors in a seemingly random pattern to reveal four more large bedrooms, a games room, a library, a gymnasium and a room full of seemingly random junk.</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” she said, finally shutting the third set of doors on a wardrobe large enough that it had a railway line on the floor, “I’ve printed up some adverts saying we do anything, any time. So if there’s a problem anywhere in Equestria and somepony needs our help, they’ll come to us.”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.6</p><p class="double">“This is the third one of these crimes in the last month,” Sergeant Stronghoof reported grimly. “Mode of operation is always the same. Jewellery stolen, box open, but the rooms are always locked. It’s a locked-room mystery, sir.”</p><p class="double">Shining blinked. “...over half the population in this city is <i>unicorns</i>, sergeant. What’s so significant about a locked room?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Stronghoof said, nodding. “I know it’s not a big deal normally, but all the owners swear blind the rooms don’t normally have locks on them.”</p><p class="double">“…oh.” Shining trotted over to examine the door more closely. “That’s not subtle, that’s showing off. And this magic got past the house owners?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Stronghoof consulted a pad of paper. “Which is rather strange, because they’re all very skilled mages who would detect this kind of thing normally.”</p><p class="double">“Sir!”</p><p class="double">Shining and the sergeant both spun to face the young guardsmare who’d spoken. “What is it, Rosette?”</p><p class="double">“Sir… there’s a letter for you outside, captain.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Shining made for the door. “I think I can handle this myself, sergeant.”</p><p class="double">“Wait – but – sir?” Stronghoof sputtered for a moment, then cantered after the captain.</p><p class="double">When he left the building, however, he saw no sign of the guard captain, and a torn envelope on the floor.</p><p><hr></p><p>A blue unicorn leant back against a chimney tower, feeling pleased with herself.</p><p class="double">Then, with a rush of wings, a white figure landed in front of her. “Give yourself up!”</p><p class="double">“Like hay!” she shouted back. “Wait. S – the S stands for <i>Shining?</i>”</p><p class="double">Trixie Lulamoon, professional criminal, collapsed on the roof heaving with laughter.</p><p class="double">Shining looked down at himself. “I didn’t think it was <i>that</i> bad…”</p><p class="double">“You’re wearing… oh, hee…” Trixie stifled her giggles with an effort of will, and rolled back upright again. “You’re dressed as <i>superman?”</i></p><p class="double">“Super-<i>pony</i>, thank you very much.” The stallion shrugged. “I’ve already got the shield, the ability to fly, and the invulnerability – with the right spell. You don’t think it fits…?”</p><p class="double">Trixie shook her head. “Nope. Does Cadence know you do this?”</p><p class="double">“Actually…” Shining pointed.</p><p class="double">Hooves clattered on the stonework as a second alicorn touched down next to them.</p><p class="double">Trixie collapsed with laughter again.</p><p class="double">“I feel hurt…” Cadence said sadly.</p><p class="double">Shining put a wing over her. “Don’t worry, Wonder Mare.”</p><p class="double">“Wonder mare!” Trixie gasped out.</p><p class="double">“Well, you’re one to talk,” Shining said stubbornly. “I mean, you <i>are</i> acting the supervillain this time.”</p><p class="double">Trixie wobbled as she climbed back to her hooves for a second time. “Yeah, thanks for – pfft – for reminding me.” She tapped the side of her neck, and the alicorn amulet dropped from where it had been hidden to dangle freely.</p><p class="double">“…wuh-oh…” Shining muttered.</p><p class="double">“Isn’t that thing evil?” Cadence asked, frowning.</p><p class="double">“Not quite evil <i>per se</i>.” Trixie shrugged, a red glow developing around her. “It’s an emotional amplifier with magical feedback and it makes you very short tempered, and it affects your judgement, but if I’m right then I shouldn’t be much more impetuous than I normally am.”</p><p class="double">“And if you’re wrong?” Shining said, a sinking feeling stealing over him.</p><p class="double">“Well, in that case, it’s nice we’re all in costume,” Trixie shrugged. “Should I tell you to Kneel Before Trixie, or shall we skip to the fight scene?”</p><p class="double">“…next time, we choose different costumes!” Shining hissed to his wife.</p><p class="double">“Aw…” Cadence replied, pouting. “But I like these ones…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight clicked her stopwatch as red/pink/blue magic erupted over the city of Canterlot. “…six hours, five minutes, twelve seconds between putting it on and resorting to force. Well, she’s getting better at controlling it…”</p><p class="double">“Is this really worth it?” Spike asked. “For the research side of it, I mean.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Borderline. But as for the show she puts on…” she slid a bag of popcorn over to him, and opened another after flash-heating it with a quick spell.</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Fair enough.” He started eating his own popcorn, as flashes like lightning bounced off the clouds. “Think we should sell tickets?”</p><p><hr></p><p>27.7 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;It was us, Mistress Rarity,&quot; said the leader of the Diamond Dogs as all the other canids ran towards the surface in sheer panic, &quot;We didn&#039;t means to, but we dug deep. Too deep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? What have you unleashed?&quot; Rairty asked, even as she prepared her emergency teleport spell.</p><p class="double">&quot;No time! No time! They&#039;ll be here soon. We must flee!&quot; The alpha dog said before he, too, ran for the exit.</p><p class="double">Rairty glanced back towards the mine when she began to hear it. It started quietly, like a whispering brook; but slowly intensified as the distance between decreased. The pale unicorn managed to pale even further, her eyes diminishing into pinpricks, as she finally recognized the sound that she would never ever forget for as long as she existed.</p><p class="double">The sound of, &quot;Fun? Fun? Fun! Fun! Funfunfunfunfunfunfunfunfun!!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>27.8 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Academic Excellence (Final part)</u></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">When Lightning Dust arrived in the mess hall the next morning, there was something different about her, her usual self confident attitude absent along with the grin on her face. The other Ponyville ponies were sitting with Dash as usual, and they quieted and turned to look at her as she came up to the table. Lightning Dust looked almost ready to turn and bolt, but Dash gave her a slight nod and a reassuring grin, so she visibly gritted her teeth, screwing up her courage to say something.</p><p class="double">“Uh.... Hey, every-pony. Good day for flying...” She tried a grin, but it didn&#039;t seem to lighten the others expressions. She sighed. “Look, guys, I&#039;ve been doing a lot of thinking, about what you all said last night, about what Dashy said, and I want to say... I&#039;m sorry!”</p><p class="double">That seemed to mollify them somewhat and, encouraged, she continued. “I guess I&#039;ve been acting like a jerk, to all of you, but I don&#039;t get this touchy-feely stuff, I&#039;ve always worked alone because, well it&#039;s hard for me to slow to other ponies speed! I love going fast and looking awesome doing it! I never figured out this whole &#039;getting along with other ponies&#039; thing because I never needed it. ”</p><p class="double">She shook her head, shaking out her mane. “But Dash was right. No Wonderbolt ever flew solo. If I ever want to join them, I need to learn. I know I haven&#039;t exactly given you much reason to help me, but that&#039;s what I&#039;m asking for. Please, could you guys give me a helping hoof?”</p><p class="double">The other ponies looked back and forth between themselves, and finally Thunderlane spoke for them. “Okay... I guess we&#039;ll soon see if you&#039;re full of cumulus or not.”</p><p class="double">After food, the group trooped out to the runway for that day&#039;s exercise. Spitfire was there, apparently getting her ears cleaned out with a sonic blast as one of her cohorts blew a reveille right next to her. However, it didn&#039;t seem to affect her speech as she gave them their mission.</p><p class="double">&quot;Today we&#039;ll be doing our famous air obstacle course. The object of this exercise is to work on your precision flying under extreme circumstances. And don&#039;t worry about winning. It&#039;s not a race.&quot;</p><p class="double">Every-pony in the cadet line up looked towards Lightning Dust, who had the good grace to blush.</p><p class="double">“Now everypony, get on your marks!”</p><p class="double">They dusted off in pairs, Snowflake and Cloudchaser in the lead, with Thunderlane and Raindrops then Milky Way and Wildflower behind them. Rainbow Dash and Lightning Dust were the last pair waved off the runway.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust spoke as soon as they were air-borne. “Okay, let&#039;s do this... don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve got it, not a race, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Rainbow Dash replied, “Doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t stay in perfect synch and blow every-pony away with our precision flying. Just give me a vector!”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust was unsurprised to find that when they got in the assigned air-lane, Dash stayed on her wing as if nailed there. They swept through the cloud hoops and weaved around the rising clouds like they weren&#039;t there and even though they weren&#039;t pushing it, they soon came up behind Milky Way and his partner.</p><p class="double">“Aw stratus! I can&#039;t see a way past without getting out of our track!” Lightning Dust exclaimed. Then she realised what she&#039;d said, and looked over at Dash. “I guess we&#039;re stuck here then?”</p><p class="double">“Not if we ask for help.” Dash replied. “This isn&#039;t a race, like the lady said. Besides, I&#039;ve got a manoeuvre that&#039;ll work. The Flying Cross!”</p><p class="double">An quick explanation and a demonstration with her fore-hooves showed Lightning Dust what to do.</p><p class="double">“I like it!” Lightning Dust replied eagerly. “Uh guys... Milky Way wasn&#039;t it and...” A whisper from Rainbow gave her “... and Wildflower. We need to pass, just stay straight and level, okay?”</p><p class="double">“You only have to ask.” Wildflower called back.</p><p class="double">“Huh, I guess so.” Lightning Dust replied, surprised at how easy that had been. “Ready?”</p><p class="double">At Rainbow Dash&#039;s nod, they powered forward, doing a roll around a common centre. They swept past the other two ponies at right angles, Dash below and Dust above, their wing-tips forming a cross with the wings of the other ponies. They completed their roll-out without mussing a single hair in the manes of the others, though the conditions made that difficult to see.</p><p class="double">“Aw yeah!” Dust punched the air. “We can blaze through this course like that!”</p><p class="double">“Sure, if you want to do it the easy way...” Rainbow grinned.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;re you talking about pony?” Lightning Dust asked back.</p><p class="double">“Well, remember my vortex manoeuvre right back the first night? We could pick up the other six as trailers and go for an eight way formation. That should knock every-pony&#039;s goggles off!”</p><p class="double">“That would be pretty awesome!” Lightning Dust called back. “You guys up for that?”</p><p class="double">“Just watch us!” Wildflower exclaimed. They flew up behind the leading ponies as the two started to rev up their wings. Dash and Dust blasted forward, and drew Milky Way and Wildflower after them. The two rear ponies were straining to keep up, even with the aid of drafting behind the leaders, but they stayed on their tails through swerve and swoop and loop the loop.</p><p class="double">They caught up with Thunderlane and his wing-pony soon after, and flying crossed past them before making the same offer, and finally Cloudchaser and Snowflake just before the nastiest part of the course where the storm winds started. Both pairs quickly agreed to the plan.</p><p class="double">The eight ponies formed a double line as they followed the leader, punching their way into the lightning filled storm tunnel. Dust powered ahead, creating dead air as Dash did the same beside her, and felt rather than saw the change as Wildflower behind her started to slip out of the formation. An extra side blast of her wing rebounded the air-flow to bring her back into line, and she called back, “Keep it together!”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust wasn&#039;t going anywhere near as fast as normal, but she found to her great surprise that she wasn&#039;t bothered about it. The ponies behind her were sticking to her tail like a cloud-burr, following her every move, relying on her to guide them, and she found she was enjoying it. Dash was letting her call the shots as lead-pony, and she suddenly realised she wanted to be worthy of that trust.</p><p class="double">The storm lashed at them, and the ponies controlling the lightning fired off near misses that practically singed their manes, but the eight ponies powered on through. Then they reached the final stage, moving horizontal bars of air.</p><p class="double">“Okay, let&#039;s buck it up a notch and go over and under!” Lightning Dust called out. The eight ponies rippled up and down as they went through at full speed, and powered out of the other side still tightly together in their wing pairs.</p><p class="double">“Okay, the big finish!” She called out. “Let&#039;s land in formation, every-pony aim to drop hooves at the same time, if you guys figure you can!”</p><p class="double">“Just watch us!” Thunderlane called forward, and Snowflake yelled “YEAH!”</p><p class="double">They blew in like a stray gale, slamming hooves down and sliding out to a stop on the runway in front of Spitfire. If the clap of hooves wasn&#039;t perfect, it was only by a fraction of a second.</p><p class="double">“An eight way formation?” Spitfire&#039;s glasses actually slid down her muzzle and she quickly pushed them back up. “Impressive. You do know you didn&#039;t have to do that?”</p><p class="double">“No-pony said we didn&#039;t either ma&#039;am!” Lightning Dust replied, saluting and trying to hold back a big grin with indifferent success.</p><p class="double">“Well, it worked.” Spitfire shook her head as she consulted her stop-watch. “That might just be the fastest time any group of cadets ever pulled on the obstacle course. Okay, you can all hit the mess. Dismissed!”</p><p class="double">“Woo hoo!” “YEAH!” “How&#039;s that for kicking some cloud!” The ponies broke formation and celebrated. As they went off, Spitfre motioned Lightning Dust over. “A word, cadet.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust suddenly lost her grin as she started to worry she might have been too cocky about their win. She glanced at Dash and took some comfor4t from the lack of worry on her face. Dash knew Spitfire better, and she wasn&#039;t the type to enjoy seeing another pony get hammered.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry cadet, I just wanted to congratulate you on the way you lead the flight.” Spitfire looked over the top of her shades. “I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;ve overcome that attitude control problem you had yesterday.”</p><p class="double">“But I didn&#039;t...” Lightning Dust did a double take. Had Spitfire just made a joke? “Yes ma&#039;am, thank you ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">The Academy head returned the salute and glanced over at Rainbow Dash. “Looks like I made the right decision, pairing the two of you together. You make a great team.”</p><p class="double">As she walked away, Dash preened.</p><p class="double">“Oh yeah! We bucked that cloud all the way to Las Pegasus!” Rainbow Dash exclaimed, raising her hoof for a hoof bump which Dust returned. “Well, all that awesomeness has made me feel hungry.”</p><p class="double">“Me too!” Lightning Dust replied, flapping out her wings. “I feel the need... the need, to feed!”</p><p class="double">Laughing and chatting the pair headed off towards the mess.</p><p><hr></p><p>“... and that was the second time I kicked out a Sonic Rainboom. Of course, every-pony has seen me do one plenty of times since, right guys?”</p><p class="double">There was agreement from the lined up cadets.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust shook her head. “I&#039;d heard rumours, but I&#039;m still having trouble believing it&#039;s even possible!”</p><p class="double">“Heh!” Rainbow Dash gave her a companionable slap on the saddle with a wing-tip. “Tell you what, I&#039;ll show you how. I&#039;ve always wanted to try it with another pony, and I think you&#039;ve got the power to pull it off. You just need training. I&#039;ve asked this lot, but...”</p><p class="double">“None of us are that nuts!” Thunderlane finished with a chuckle.</p><p class="double">The rainbow maned pegasus&#039; eyes suddenly widened. “Oh yeah, I got a letter from Pinkie. She&#039;s so happy to hear how well we&#039;re doing that she and the girls are bringing us a care package.”</p><p class="double">That whoops of appreciation from the other Ponyville ponies. They all knew how great Pinkie&#039;s parties were. Knowing how nuts Pinkie had gotten the first time, Rainbow generally made sure to send regular updates on her progress, even when they were all Awake and otherwise pretty much following a base-line loop. However, that didn&#039;t stop Pinkie being Pinkie, or finding any excuse to throw a party.</p><p class="double">“I figure we&#039;ll set up on a cloud outside the Academy this evening after training, as long as we don&#039;t break curfew we should be fine. They&#039;ll be bringing a lot of food, we can charge up a nimbus and roast some marshmallows, surf some air-currents, play cloud-ball, rock out to some tunes... It&#039;s going to be awesome!”</p><p class="double">“Whoa there pony!” Lightning Dust exclaimed. “You said these were earth-ponies and unicorns... won&#039;t they fall through?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight can do a cloud-walking spell easy. Though she might try something more interesting...”</p><p class="double">There. If one of her friends wanted to go alicorn for the night, she could pass it off as an improved Wings spell Twilight had created.</p><p class="double">“It sounds great, Am I invited?” Lightning asked, not brashly as she might one have, but hopefully. She&#039;d never realised how good it was to be part of a group, or that you could do it without giving up being you. Despite yesterday, she was still feeling her way into her new relationship with these ponies, and didn&#039;t want to wreck it.</p><p class="double">“Heck yeah!” Rainbow Dash exclaimed. “Right guys?”</p><p class="double">Wildflower spoke up. “If she hadn&#039;t helped me recover in that formation exercise, I&#039;d have spun out and wrecked the whole thing. I never got to thank you for that, Lightning. So thanks, and we&#039;d love to have you.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re as nuts as she is!” Thunderlane added without heat. “So maybe with you on our side, a cloud-ball team will have a chance against Dash. So sure, the more the merrier!”</p><p class="double">As the others gave their approval, Rainbow saw Spitfire approaching out of the corner of her eye, and gave the others the high sign. By the time the instructors got there, the cadets were lined up at attention and silent.</p><p class="double">“Today is a competitive exercise. You will be working in your wing-pairs to clear the clouds.” Spitfire looked over the group and was pleased to see that much of the tension she&#039;d seen before had dissipated, though a couple of the other cadets glanced at Rainbow Dash and suppressed smirks when the nature of the exercise was stated. “Any questions?”</p><p class="double">Whatever else was going on, there were none so she signalled to Whiplash to blow the whistle and start the exercise. The other cadets flew up in staggered pairs and started punching out clouds in a methodical manner, trading off the lead as each hit a cloud and demolished it, hitting their weak spots. However, they didn&#039;t have chance to get far.</p><p class="double">“Okay, let&#039;s go!” Lightning Dust yelled out, blasting through the first cloud she saw without stopping.</p><p class="double">“Way ahead of you!” Rainbow Dash called from up ahead as she flew between two close together clouds and used an aileron roll to create a temporary vortex that drew them in and mashed them to pieces. “The trick is to keep it small and tight, bigger is not better, just harder to control.”</p><p class="double">The two went through the air like greased lightning, indeed Lightning Dust&#039;s contrail heightened the likeness. As they approached having cleared three quarters of the sky, Dash started to slow down.</p><p class="double">“Hey, you getting tired?” Lightning Dust called out as she came alongside.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash gave back a cocky grin . “As if! No, I just figured we could let the rest of the guys have some too.”</p><p class="double">“This is a competition!” Lightning Dust replied, frowning, and slicing a cloud apart en-passant with a wing-tip and a burst of weather magic.</p><p class="double">“You don&#039;t think we&#039;ve won?” Rainbow Dash asked, veering to point a hoof back at the vast swathe of clear sky.</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust gave a tight shake of her head. “No, but I want to finish this properly. I don&#039;t want to say I did less than my best. Even if it costs me that invite.”</p><p class="double">“If it does, it won&#039;t be from me. None of them are sore losers, and you&#039;re the lead-pony in this formation, so let&#039;s go!”</p><p class="double">They blew away the majority of the remaining clouds in moments, and came in to land ahead of the other teams. The target area far over the Academy had been much larger than the valley of Ponyville, but it had only taken them a couple of minutes total.</p><p class="double">As the other pairs flew down to land around her, Lightning Dust looked around. No-pony seemed particularly annoyed that they&#039;d been utterly out classed.</p><p class="double">“It was a competition. I wasn&#039;t going to hold back, okay?” she exclaimed defensively.</p><p class="double">Vast amounts of spontaneous rage failed to materialise, and Lightning Dust looked relieved. “So no-pony&#039;s mad?”</p><p class="double">“Pfft! Like any-body stood a chance against Miss &#039;Clear a sky in ten seconds flat&#039; over there even by herself.” Cloudchaser replied.</p><p class="double">Milky Way added. “No-pony&#039;s going to buck lightning over some-pony winning fair and square. Or if they are, they&#039;re idiots.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks... Wait? Ten seconds?” The green pegasus turned to Dash. “You were holding back?”</p><p class="double">“I was sticking with my lead pony.” Dash shrugged. “And Ponyville&#039;s in a valley. Smaller sky area.”</p><p class="double">Whiplash had only just finished adding checks to the chalkboard, as they&#039;d actually destroyed the clouds faster than he&#039;d been able to mark it off. He turned to go to fetch Spitfire with a somewhat sandbagged expression, when a half scale glowing white alicorn alighted by Rainbow Dash. It had a slight haziness moved rather like solid smoke.</p><p class="double">It spoke in Twilight&#039;s voice. “Rainbow Dash! We&#039;ve got a problem! We were skirting the edge of the Everfree Forest on the way to the Academy and we picked up an unwanted stalker. It&#039;s a massive cloud but it&#039;s acting like a creature. It&#039;s chasing us and with the balloon so heavily loaded, it&#039;s all we can do to stay ahead of it. We need help!”</p><p class="double">An image projected from its horn of a towering cumulonimbus, but with black triangular holes as eyes and a gaping maw with continuous arcs of lightning forming the outline of jagged teeth. Great tornadoes of streaming cloud formed arms that left trails behind them, sucking any in any cloud that got too close. The image wavered for a moment, then vanished, as did the alicorn.</p><p class="double">“Oh pony-feathers!” Dash exclaimed, “I read about them in the old weather-pony logs for Ponyville, but I thought they were just an old pony tale made up by some-pony who&#039;d had one too many mugs of Granny Smith&#039;s special reserve!”</p><p class="double">Inwardly she was given furiously to think. Had Twilight set this up as some sort of alternative test of character? It was probably clear from Dash&#039;s last letter that she&#039;d pretty much derailed the regular plot. She was certainly holding back, as any of the ponies in that balloon could probably have taken it out. But Twilight wasn&#039;t the sort to drop something on any-pony unannounced, and Dash <i>had</i> read about such things in the old weather-pony logs, and it was an Ursa Major threat level for any-pony who wasn&#039;t an immortal alicorn.</p><p class="double">“What the hey was that!” Lightning Dust gasped, and she wasn&#039;t the only one.</p><p class="double">“The silver thing? A communication spell Twilight&#039;s been working on. The cloud? A Tempest, right out of the Everfree forest. Remember, clouds move by themselves over there, and the place is lousy with magic. No-pony knows how they form, but it&#039;s similar to a Timberwolf, a vicious predator that feeds on magical energy...”</p><p class="double">She turned to the stunned Whiplash and yelled. “Go get Spitfire, scramble every-pony you can and head after us! Head south southeast. We&#039;ll need all the help we can get!”</p><p class="double">As he galloped off, the other cadets were looking equally surprised. Cloudchaser shook her head. “I can&#039;t believe they&#039;re real... Wait, did you mean...”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re the only ponies on the runway, they&#039;ll need time to get organised and Twilight and the others may not have that long... I know it&#039;s not what you signed up for, but some-pony has to delay it and get the balloon clear. And I <i>know</i> you&#039;re the ponies for the job!”</p><p class="double">The other Ponyville ponies looked back and forth, and you could see their expressions firm up along with their resolve and their wings.</p><p class="double">She turned to Lightning Dust. “We have to go, they&#039;re in danger and they need our help.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust gulped. That thing was horrifying, every pegasus&#039; worst nightmare, but she was a Lead pony, and she couldn&#039;t let the others go and hide here, not and look at herself in the mirror in the morning. “Okay, but you&#039;re going to tell us everything you know about this creature on the way.”</p><p class="double">She dusted off, and the others followed her, or more probably Dash, who filled them in on what little was known. These things made Timberwolves look bright, but they were still dangerous as they would attack whatever attracted their attention. A large mass of ponies could drive them back with their combined weather magic, but it would take all the pegasi in Ponyville to do the job.</p><p class="double">It was crazy, Rainbow Dash clearly knew the thing and all the other ponies followed her, but she was acting as if she expected Lightning Dust to give the orders. Yes, as Lead pony of the highest scoring wing-pair, she was effectively the leader of the group, but she was beginning to realise as never before the difference between authority and leadership.</p><p class="double">She panicked for just a second, but something in her realised that if she lost it now, she&#039;d never get it back, so she forced herself to think. What has Dash said about leadership?... Okay.</p><p class="double">“Ideas any-pony? As Dash said, we need to get the balloon clear and keep the thing contained until every-pony else gets there.”</p><p class="double">Cloudchaser piped up. “Snowflake and I can tow the balloon. We&#039;re not the fastest flyers, but he&#039;s one of the strongest.“</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” Snowflake agreed.</p><p class="double">“We could play cloud-tag with it, take turns to distract it and keep it changing which way it&#039;s going.” Milky Way mused.</p><p class="double">“That works!” Lightning Dust said. “Dash?”</p><p class="double">“If we go in at different heights, that should mix it up even more. Those twister arms can&#039;t change height or direction too fast.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust nodded. “We&#039;ll take the middle as we&#039;ll be doing the most dodging.”</p><p class="double">Wildflower looked at Milky Way. “Up high?”</p><p class="double">He nodded and Thunderlane said, “I guess that leaves us the low ponies on the totem pole, eh Raindrops?”</p><p class="double">They started to see the trouble ahead, the balloon was floating towards them, towed by Fluttershy and aided by the glow of Twilight&#039;s and Rarity&#039;s horns. Pinkie Pie was in the crow&#039;s nest on top of the balloon, and was clearly trying to drive it off with blasts from Pinkie&#039;s party canon while Applejack was managing Fluttershy&#039;s rope.</p><p class="double">Dash knew all of them were awake, though they&#039;d been staying low profile this loop to relax. So they could have handled this thing like small change, but they&#039;d clearly decided to leave it to Dash and her team. Dash worried for a moment, could her fellow pegasi handle it? Then she looked around at her flight group, and Lightning Dust... or rather her group, full stop. They were scared, and unlike Rainbow Dash they had reason to be, but they were also determined and ready to face that thing, take the risk and she couldn&#039;t take that away from them.</p><p class="double">Snowflake and Cloudchaser peeled off the formation as they passed, flying round to come up either side of Fluttershy. They quickly got their own ropes courtesy of Applejack, and the balloon finally started to pull away.</p><p class="double">The other three wing-pairs dove in towards the cloud monster itself , splitting off to take their assigned heights. As they&#039;d agreed on the way in Lightning Dust and Dash went first, pulling down their goggles as they went into attack formation.</p><p class="double">Dash swept in close and zipped back and forth. “Hey you, Puff the magic cloud! Your momma was a sub-tropical convection cell! I&#039;ve seen scarier clouds when I breath out on a cold morning! C&#039;mon you Nimrod Nimbus, come and get me!”</p><p class="double">While it clearly didn&#039;t understand the insults, the cloud monster was clearly tracking her with its &#039;eyes&#039;. It roared like a storm wind blowing through the trees and a vast funnel arm swung towards her as it veered away from following the balloon to chase her. She could have out ranged it easily, but that wasn&#039;t the idea. Instead she actually flew in closer to make sure its attention focussed on her. The cloud&#039;s tornado &#039;arms&#039; flailed after her.</p><p class="double">“Dash, let&#039;s tie it up!” Lightning Dust called as she dived in. “Yo, fog-face! You couldn&#039;t hit the ground with a rain storm! Yeah Lightning Lips, I&#039;m talking about you! C&#039;mon you third-rate thunderhead, start something!”</p><p class="double">The cloud reached after her and she let the edge of one tornado tug at her tail, but she broke free and drew it after her as Dash did the same for the other arm. Without actually saying anything, they flew in and around each other, and as they did the two tornadoes became intertwined, immobilising them.</p><p class="double">They swooped out of the tangle as a pair, whooping and laughing. “Oh yeah, we have wings, we have the talent... whoa!”</p><p class="double">Dash&#039;s bad-ass boast was interrupted as she bucked Lightning Dust away from her, a fraction of a second before a bolt of lightning about half the width and twice the length of the Canterlot Express passed through the airspace they&#039;d just occupied, and just barely failed to turn them both into Southern Fried pegasus nuggets.</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t know it could do that!” she exclaimed. “We can&#039;t let the others get hit! They&#039;ll have to back off.”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust shook her head, as they veered out of the way of another bolt that tracked after them. “No! They&#039;ll be harder to hit, but easier to track. They need to stay in tight so it can&#039;t focus!”</p><p class="double">Dash thought for a split second. “Good call!”</p><p class="double">She amped up her voice using weather magic to modulate the air and yelled, “Keep close and keep dodging! Don&#039;t let it home in on you!”</p><p class="double">As they weaved around clouds in extreme evasion manoeuvres, they saw its arms were untangling. Dash growled. She was this close to opening a storm of alicorn style flank-whooping on the thing, but that would wreck all the work she&#039;d done, and there was a better way. “Uh oh! If they try and bust that cloud the regular way, ponies are going to get hurt!”</p><p class="double">“So you have an irregular way?”</p><p class="double">“What do you say to a double Sonic Rainboom delivered right to the heart of that thing from above?”</p><p class="double">“Most people would say you&#039;ve swallowed too much cloud and it&#039;s fogging your brain...” Lightning Dust exclaimed then gave a little growl. “... but I guess they were right. I am just as nuts as you. Of course you haven&#039;t taught me how to do a Sonic Rainboom. “</p><p class="double">“No time like the present! Come on!” Dash suddenly went into a vertical ascent, calling out to the others as they flew past, “Just keep it off balance for a few more seconds, then scatter when we hit it!”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ll need some altitude!” Dash pushed some real power into her wings, giving them a slight rainbow aura, and shot upwards as if someone had just repealed the law of gravity. Lightning Dust panted to keep up with her, and just barely managed it. They came to a stop far above the scene of the battle, with the cloud a tiny puffy shape below, harried by the specks of circling pegasi.</p><p class="double">“Whoa! You can go that fast in an ascent?” Lightning Dust gasped for air until she felt Dash&#039;s weather magic wash over her and the air thicken around her.</p><p class="double">“Wait until you see what&#039;s next!” Dash grinned. “Besides you matched me.”</p><p class="double">She held out her fore-hooves. Place yours against mine, then we dive and stay together. Focus any weather magic you can spare from speeding up to forming a shield in front of you. You should be able to feel what I&#039;m doing, just match it, okay?”</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust gave a curt nod, and touched fore-hooves to Dash&#039;s. “Let&#039;s do this!”</p><p class="double">They inverted in mid-air, still in contact, and started to dive, matching wing-beats. They quickly went past their ascent speed and kept accelerating at a rate even Lightning Dusts hadn&#039;t thought she could manage. Any pegasus worth their pinion feathers had a go at seeing how fast they could go in a power-dive at least once in their lives, but this was pushing limits she hadn&#039;t even realised she had. On top of that, she was trying to balance the power she put into accelerating with the weather magic she was feeding into the shock wave that started to form in front of them.</p><p class="double">Her hooves started to peel away from Dash&#039;s as she started to exhaust herself, and she cried, “I can&#039;t hold it...”</p><p class="double">“You can!” Dash called back, “I know you can do this, and every-pony&#039;s We&#039;re relying on you! Remember, the bigger the challenge... ”</p><p class="double">Lightning gritted her teeth. “... the better we like it!”</p><p class="double">The Wonderbolt mantra flashed through her mind, along with the last time she&#039;d heard it. They were getting near the cloud now, and she could see the other ponies clearly, still playing a deadly game of tag to hold it in place. Other moments flashed through her thoughts, leading them through the obstacle course, the way they&#039;d accepted her once she&#039;d stopped being a jerk. Most of all throughout it was Dash, defending her, supporting her, believing in her; even when she&#039;d done nothing to warrant it...</p><p class="double">It reached something deep inside her, and she felt it explode outwards, giving her new energy. Dash had put her faith in Lightning Dust, and she was <i>not</i> going to let her friend down. She came back into synch with Dash, and threw that power into her wings and the shockwave, which transformaed into a sharp cone that crackled with energy.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Dash exulted. “On my mark, we buck it over...”</p><p class="double">The cadet pegasi dodging around the increasingly frantic cloud monster saw a brilliant column in the sky, equal parts rainbow and lightning as it speared down into the crown of the monster with a glowing arrowhead at its tip. The cloud creature froze for a fraction of a second, and the triangular slits of its eyes suddenly turned into almost comical circles. The four of them took the chance to dive outwards and set their wings to ride the wave they knew was coming.</p><p class="double">The rainbow halo, shot with lightning and gold, exploded outwards just above the thing&#039;s mouth, slicing it in two and disrupting the magical forces that held it together. It scattered the pegasi like windblown leaves, but they&#039;d been ready for it, and it didn&#039;t hurt them. They could only hope the same was true for the two pegasi who&#039;d been at the centre of it.</p><p class="double">Thunderlane and Raindrops were carried in the direction of the Academy, and thus were the first ones to meet up with the relief force. Twilight&#039;s balloon was there, surrounded by wings of Wonderbolts, flying in staggered echelons. They had to have assembled every-pony in the place, cadets and instructors, and some of the pegasi at the back were harnessed in teams, towing lightning and storm projectors from the obstacle course.</p><p class="double">They headed for the apex of the lead chevron, where Spitfire, still in her mess dress uniform had point. They were quickly joined by Snowflake and Cloudchaser, who&#039;d been flying escort to the balloon. Spitfire saw them immediately. She waved off the salute they gave.</p><p class="double">“Cadet, report! Was that a Sonic Rainboom?”</p><p class="double">Thunderlane was the pony she addressed. “Yea ma&#039;am! Rainbow dash and Lightning Dust hit the thing together and destroyed it.”</p><p class="double">Spitfire nodded. “I saw the light trail and the explosion from here. What about them, and your other wing pair?”</p><p class="double">“Wildflower and Milky Way rode the wave the way we did, but they were around to the side. They must be half way to Ponyville by now. As for Dash and Dust... I couldn&#039;t see what happened, no-pony could.”</p><p class="double">Spitfire looked past him to where the cloud monster had disintegrated, and for the first time, he realised he could see worry in her eyes. He understood why, the energies at the heart of that cloud would have been enough to tear almost any pegasus to shreds if they placed a wing wrong. “Let&#039;s hope they&#039;re as capable as they seem to think they are...”</p><p class="double">Cloudchaser piped up. “They&#039;re tough! They&#039;ll be okay...”</p><p class="double">her eyes suddenly widened as she suddenly realised how familiar she was being. “...Ma&#039;am! Sorry, ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">Spitfire just shook her head. “It&#039;s okay cadet, I can understand you&#039;re a little out of it. You did good, all of you. But for now, we have other things to worry about. We need to set up search parties...”</p><p class="double">“No we don&#039;t!” A new voice had spoken. Pinkie Pie arrived, held up by a bunch of party balloons tied around her middle and propelling herself by spinning her candy-floss tail like a propeller. She pointed in the direction of the cloud, where two dots had just become visible. They flew towards the massed pegasi, and resolved themselves into Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">Both of them were flying relatively slowly, and both of them looked as if they&#039;d been dragged through a thunderstorm backwards (which they had, pretty much) but both of them were flying straight and level, and both had big, if tired grins on their faces. They flew up to Spitfire as the other cadets parted for them, and Lightning Dust snapped off a salute.</p><p class="double">“Cadets Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash reporting completion of cloud clearing duty, ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">Snowflake started what happened next, clapping his fore-hooves together slowly and deliberately. The other cadets took up the clapping, and then some of the other pegasi. The clapping swelled, speeding up as ponies started to cheer, while Pinkie puttered over and glomped Dash like a rainbow flavoured toothpaste tube.</p><p class="double">Spitfire spoke over the applause. “I&#039;ll debrief the two of you in my office afterwards, but first, I think both of you need to rest. Let&#039;s get you back to the Academy... all of you.”</p><p class="double">She detailed a party of fresh pegasi to go find Wildflower and Milky Way, then formed up the remainder of the Academy to escort the cadets and Twilight&#039;s balloon back to the airfield.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">27.9 (misterq, 26.10 continued)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">It was early morning at Hogwarts where a young pink bushy-headed girl sat on her bed, playfully swinging her legs. It was a very rare moment where Pinkie Pie was feeling a bit introspective. She had spent a few loops, ones that had her start out back at her parents&#039; rock farm, trying to act like a normal pony. One that was cheerful and liked birthdays, but didn&#039;t celebrate at every opportunity. One that didn&#039;t bounce around everywhere or eat vast amounts of sugar. One that knew about commonly accepted social graces and personal space, unlike someone who had grown up with her only friends being inanimate objects.</p><p class="double">She had even pranked her looping friends in one iteration by acting like a completely normal pony for a whole month. </p><p class="double">But in the end, she decided that she liked being Pinkie. She got a warm ticklish feeling whenever the others said &#039;It&#039;s just Pinkie being Pinkie&#039;. She liked throwing parties and eating horrifying amounts of sugary sweets and pretending not to know what was socially acceptable and what wasn&#039;t. Whenever she did something that was inexplicably impossible, she brought a bit of wonder and joy into her friends&#039; lives. </p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t as easy doing that as when she was a chaos goddess. That loop left a lasting impression on her magic, but that seemed to be it. After all, it wasn&#039;t like she now had a galaxy full of super happy space elves worshiping her.</p><p class="double">&#039;Yet,&#039; giggled a little voice inside of her. </p><p class="double">&#039;No,&#039; Pinkie laughed at her own subconscious, &#039;and no going magical alicorn demi-goddess on this world, because that will end all the fun. And I&#039;m having way too much of it for it to end so soon.&#039;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie bounced out of her bed and grabbed her wand, &quot;Letters to send, potions ingredients to procure, cakes to bake with the castle house elves, Pinkie Promise Breakers to... talk to. This day is going to be so FUN!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight tentatively opened another of her overseas friend&#039;s letters and read out loud to the remainder of her gathered friends, <i>&quot;Hi everyone! It&#039;s a letter from me, Pinkie Pie, again! How are you all doing? I&#039;m am fantasti-mazing as always. So many things happened I don&#039;t know where to start, so I&#039;ll just guess.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;After our old defence teacher left in such a hurry, a new one was hired. His name is Gilderoy Lockhart, and I had him Pinkie Promise that he would be a good teacher unlike the last one. He promptly broke it in his first class when he explained how he stole the memories of the people who actually did all the heroic stuff he said he did himself; and that he wasn&#039;t even that good at defence spells or care about teaching well; or that that shade of blonde was not his natural hair colour!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;How scandalous,&quot; Rairty exclaimed, causing her friends to give her a brief glance before going back to the letter.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Also in unrelated news, it&#039;s possible to mix a magical truth serum with a secret babbling potion and turn them both into an aerosol mist. Who knew? Anyways, I was about to talk to him to let him know how disappointed I was that he broke a Pinkie Promise, but he somehow got a bit of (okay, a lot of) fear potion and spider pheromones all over him, and ran off screaming into the super spooky forbidden forest. They looked for him for a while, but no sign yet. I think as long as he knows some defence spells, he should be fine.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash slowly turned towards Applejack and said, &quot;You got off easy, AJ. That one time you almost broke a Pinkie Promise could have ended with you as bride of the spider people.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack just shuddered and said, &quot;Just keep reading, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight complied, <i>&quot;Our history professor was a boring ghost, but I laughed at him and, you guessed it, I got detention. Then, next class, I did an exorcism ritual I made up and the other professors had to come and close the howling portal to the screaming netherworld that somehow opened up right as I was finishing up. I knew I should have had an old priest and a young priest, but I thought that ordaining my friends, Harry and Neville, should have worked fine; at least unless either of them had some previous unknown exposure to death magic or death magic related artifacts and accessories. But what was the chances of that?&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;In the end, Binns, our old history ghost is now history. Get it? Because he was sucked into a horrible vortex. To replace him, the ministry of magic sent this large woman who likes kittens and pink sweaters so very much. We&#039;re going to be such good friends, I just know it!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;My detention wasn&#039;t so bad. I had to clean a school bathroom. I guess I cleaned it too well, because one moment I was rubbing this neat little snake carving; and the other moment, I was sliding down a super duper fun slide. Then I met my new friend, who I decided to call &#039;Big Blinky&#039;, or BB for short. Some would say that Big Blinky is a giant snake, but that&#039;s not true at all. BB is a basilisk and as such has a hinged jaw and eyelids, so that means BB is a legless lizard. With eye beams. I spent the rest of the night riding around the spooky forest on BB&#039;s back, hunting spiders while yelling out, &#039;Maud&#039;dib!&#039; Best detention ever!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;In conclusion, the end. Just kidding! I&#039;m sure more fun stuff is coming. As always, I&#039;ll let you know when a good time to visit. With lots of parties, Pinkie Pie.&quot;</i></p><p><i><hr></i></p><p><i>27.10 (masterweaver)</i></p><p><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">&quot;Jack. Sparrow.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion turned around. &quot;Twilight Spoirkle! Fancy seeing you on this fancy ship. Fancy, innit?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yes. It&#039;s very fancy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Flying ships, I said. Flying ships. You know, that&#039;s very clever, I&#039;m going to have to figure out this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you know who this ship belongs to?&quot; Twilight continued calmly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold up. Let me ask the crew. NAVIGATOR!&quot;</p><p class="double">A blonde pegasus saluted, swaying slightly. &quot;Yes Captain?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who does this ship belong to?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;d be you, captain!&quot;</p><p class="double">Jack smiled, turning back to Twilight. &quot;So, apparently, this is my ship.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bearer of magic sighed, rubbing her forehead. &quot;Cloudkicker, why are you helping him steal this ship?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Steal?&quot; The violet pegasus fluttered over. &quot;This. This isn&#039;t stealing. This ship is his, fair and square.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;THIS IS PRINCE BLUEBLOOD&#039;S PERSONAL YACHT!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Was,&quot; Jack said calmly. &quot;Right up till he gave me the deed, see, I&#039;ve got a contract.&quot; He rustled at his pockets, muttering something about fingers before he finally pulled out a scroll. &quot;Signature, legal mumbo jumbo, aaaaand... ah, seal of office. Which is his tattoo thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cutie mark,&quot; Cloudkicker corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what I said.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned. &quot;I&#039;d accuse you of casting some sort of spell if I could figure any of this out--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You hear that Berry? You&#039;re a witch!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch stumbled up from below deck. &quot;Really? Want some of my brew?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it rum?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;MOSTLY rum!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bring it on up witch!&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple mare cackled as she descended again.</p><p class="double">&quot;We totally need to have a threesome with her,&quot; Cloudkicker commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;I agree. Twilight, care to join us?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn let out a tortured groan. &quot;Why are you being so... so childish?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Jack tilted his head. &quot;I take it, that&#039;s a no.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HOW DID THIS EVEN HAPPEN?!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pirate shrugged. &quot;Funny story, really...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Blueblood moaned as the light assaulted his eyes. &quot;Ugh. That is the last time I ever drink... any. Any peasant drink.

<p>28.1</p><p class="double">“Sis?” Big Mac said, worried. She’d been like this – very tired – since the reunion and that thing with the Nightmare Moon or whatever, and he couldn’t see a reason for it.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah, Mac,” she replied woozily. “Ah got it.”</p><p class="double">She stamped a hoof on the floor, and the earth rippled out from the impact point.</p><p class="double">And every single tree in the orchard dropped all its apples.</p><p class="double">Amazed, Mac watched as the ripple spread out, reaching the picket fences marking the boundaries of the Apple orchard, and then back in again carrying the just-dropped fruits.</p><p class="double">Humping up into a curler, the earth poured them neatly into boxes.</p><p class="double">Still with her eyes half closed, Applejack closed the boxes and stamped them with the Apple family proof mark. “Am ah done?”</p><p class="double">“…eeyup,” he replied quietly.</p><p class="double">“Good.” The earth pony mare walked into the barn, and collapsed onto a hay pile before starting to snore.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Sorry…” Applejack said, wincing. “Ah know ah was supposed to join th’ discussion yesterday about what t’ do this loop, but after last loop… y’all know, with th’ army of airships and th’ police job…”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded sympathetically. “Yes, I know the feeling – I’ve slept through a loop before after an especially tiring one, though only with somepony else like Dash around to take up the slack… or at least I try to.”</p><p class="double">The Anchor smiled. “Still, at least you got the harvest done on time.”</p><p class="double">“…ah did what?”</p><p class="double">Twilight held up a photo.</p><p class="double">Applejack winced again. “Ah, ponyfeathers. So much fer a quiet loop, after that ah’m gonna get interviewed…”</p><p class="double">“What happened, then?” Twilight asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“Earthbendin’, it’s called. Seems it’s more instinctual than ah was expectin’.”</p><p class="double">AJ winked at Twilight’s blank look, then laughed as it turned into ‘swot mode’. “Easy, there, Twi. Ah’ll explain what th’ place was like when ah’m good an’ ready.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.2</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon walked out onto stage. “Well, well. It’s been so long since-”</p><p class="double">There was a snigger.</p><p class="double">“Who did that?” she asked, turning towards where the voice had come from. “Admit it!”</p><p class="double">That brought a smattering of giggles.</p><p class="double">“Stop it!” she shouted. The giggles died away. “Right. Now. My… <i>beloved…</i> subjects-”</p><p class="double">Somepony made a muffled snort sound, as though a hoof was desperately and imperfectly restraining the sound of hilarity.</p><p class="double">“Oh, this is ridiculous!” Nightmare Moon fluffed out her feathers and stomped on the floor, producing a roar of laughter. “If you will not take my return seriously, then I am leaving! You’re all horrid!”</p><p class="double">Silence gradually descended, with only the occasional strained giggle cutting through it.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon decided to ignore those brief spurts of hilarity, and got started on her speech. Unfortunately, when she got to the bit about the night lasting forever, it was too much to take and every single pony in the hall burst into uncontrollable guffaws.</p><p class="double">“Hmph!” she said, turning up her nose and flouncing out, chased by laughter.</p><p class="double">It took quite a long time. After all, she was only filly sized, and that meant a lot of steps to get off the stage.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How was that?” Nyx asked, reclaiming her glasses and hairband from Twilight backstage.</p><p class="double">“I think it went pretty well,” Twilight replied. “Maybe if you hadn’t had a squeaky voice as well it might have been touch-and-go, but that was the masterpiece.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed,” Luna said. “Actually, would you handle all my public appearances this Loop?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Would</i> I?” Nyx repeated, giggling.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There was a crack of thunder and a flash of lightning, and several ponies flinched back as the chariot came stooping out of the sky.</p><p class="double">Then they paused.</p><p class="double">“What?” Nyx asked, ostentatiously paying no attention to her pumpkin costume. “Oh, am I not scary enough? Grrr.”</p><p class="double">Somehow, it seemed like the ponies of Ponyville were not as terrified as they might perhaps have been.</p><p class="double">Nyx rolled her eyes, making the costume fluff out. “Oh, sure, it’s fine for a pony to dress up as a chicken, but you get the deity of the night coming to her own festival as a pumpkin and suddenly they’re ‘not in the spirit of the holiday’. Well, hmph.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, did I miss anything?” Nyx asked, wings whirring frantically as she landed in front of the Elements.</p><p class="double">Celestia just gave her a look.</p><p class="double">“…wow, the party must have been awesome to demolish half the castle like this! How come you didn’t wake me up?” Nyx looked upset. “Is it ‘cause I don’t look old enough to be allowed alcohol? And that’s a stupid rule by the way, I’m totally old enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I just…” Scootaloo shrugged desperately. “I want Dash to like me, but it seems like I just can’t get her to treat me how I want.”</p><p class="double">“Well…” Nyx frowned, clearly thinking hard. “In my experience, nothing helps you connect with a sister figure like turning evil, becoming corrupted by your own power, confronting your sister, fighting her, losing, being banished to the moon by the Elements of Harmony for a thousand years, shrinking, coming back to Equestria in a hilariously abortive attempt at a coup…” she paused. “I might have forgotten the next bit, but anyway it <i>does</i> work. Could be tricky to arrange, though. Do you have super powers?”</p><p class="double">“No,” Scootaloo deadpanned.</p><p class="double">“Well, we could start with that.” Nyx smiled encouragingly. “Maybe we could get Pinkie to make you a gyrocopter, and you could be Gyrocopter Pony, the Pony with a Gyrocopter.”</p><p class="double">At Scootaloo’s look, Nyx shrugged. “I don’t exactly have much to go on here, work with me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.3 (Nutjob)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...forever!&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare laughed maniacally as the ponies gathered below her cowered in her presence. It was over. Celestia was defeated, locked within her own accursed sun before the black alicorn halted the infernal orb below Equestria’s horizon altogether. Soon, she would be forgotten, and the sun would be nothing more than a old pony’s tale. Her subjects would learn to appreciate her night, and she would get the respect and adoration she <i><b>deserved! </b></i></p><p class="double">“Excuse me, Your Majesty?” a voice called out. The kingdom’s new monarch looked down at the crowd gathered below. A purple unicorn was smiling back up at her. “Hello! I&#039;m so glad to finally make your acquaintance, Your Majesty. My name is Twilight Sparkle, and I&#039;m positively honored to be able to offer my services to the crown.” The unicorn bowed respectfully. </p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon raised an eyebrow in confusion. This... Twilight Sparkle seemed unnaturally calm compared to everypony else in the room, as though she had been expecting her. And what services was she referring to? The alicorn shook her head. It didn&#039;t matter, one of her new subjects was already warming up to her. This presented an opportunity. Reward this subject for her loyalty and more would follow. &quot;Rise, Twilight Sparkle. Your new queen is pleased to see that there are ponies such as yourself that are prepared to embrace her gift of eternal night.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn looked up at her once again, beaming from the praise. Around her, Nightmare Moon could she the crowd glaring at her, and heard the word &quot;traitor&quot; uttered more than once, but the unicorn paid them no heed. &quot;Thank you, Your Majesty. That means a lot.&quot; Twilight produced a pocket watch, and glanced at it. “It looks like you arrived not a minute too soon. I think it&#039;s best that we get started right away.”</p><p class="double">&quot;Get started with... what, exactly?&quot; Nightmare Moon asked, cocking her head.</p><p class="double">This time, it was Twilight’s turn to look confused. “Wait, didn’t your sister tell you?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon blinked at that. Her sister? Come to think of it…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>A black alicorn appeared in a brilliant flash of light.</i></p><p class="double"><i>“<b>I… have… returned!</b>” she shouted into the air.</i></p><p class="double"><i>“Luna! There you are.” Nightmare Moon to face the voice. Her. Oh course she would be here, but she would not be victorious again. “Oh, I’m so glad to see you again. I have missed you so much, dear sister. Listen, I know you are angry with me, but you should know I scheduled an appointment with-”</i></p><p class="double"><i>The white alicorn disappeared when she was struck by a beam of dark blue magic. “<b>To the sun with you!</b>”</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“No, she did not mention anything about this at all.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn sighed and shook her head. “It’s just like her to leave me to explain everything. Alright, I’m sorry, you’re probably confused. Let me reintroduce myself. I’m Twilight Sparkle, Royal Psychologist.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...all those evenings I spent pouring my heart and soul into the sky, making the stars shimmer and sparkle and crafting beautiful constellations, and... and... *sniff* ...and they just slept through it! Every single night!&quot; Nightmare Moon sobbed. Twilight levitated over a box of tissues. The black alicorn pause her story for a moment to dry her eyes and clean her runny nose. “Thank you… *sniff* I just… I just wanted everypony to see what I created. My sister… she always got all the attention. Everypony thanked her for the sun and the light it brought. But nopony ever thanked me for the moon or the stars. I thought if I just kept trying to make it more beautiful, somepony would notice eventually but… but no matter how hard I tried I… they...”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon broke down into another tearful fit. Inwardly, Twilight was actually quite pleased with her current progress this loop. The hardest part of this plan, getting the Luna’s egotistical dark persona to submit herself to therapy, was already out of the way. Sure, while the black alicorn may have <i>initially</i> responded by trying to take her head off with a blast of focused magical energy for having dared suggest that her new queen’s mental state was anything short of perfection, spending several lifetimes replacing Celestia during her rule over Equestria had made her quite the diplomat.</p><p class="double">Talking her down hadn&#039;t been easy, but by playing the scared, helpless unicorn who was only trying to serve her new queen, she had managed to calm Nightmare Moon down enough to stop her destructive rampage. After that, coaxing her into attending the session had been a matter of careful word choices, ego stroking, a few hypothetical scenarios, and a cheerful attitude sprinkled with hints of adoration. Even under the dark influence of the nightmare, Luna, at her core, had still only truly desired some appreciation and attention. After she agreed, Twilight was actually surprised how quickly she opened up. It made her wonder whether or not Celestia had tried this <i>before</i> banishing her sister to the moon for a thousand years. Something to ask about.</p><p class="double">Either way, seeing the black alicorn sobbing in the middle of her tree (which she converted into a makeshift office) was something she wished her friends were here to see. Well, her looping ones, anyway. Their non-looping selves, Spike included, were peeking in through a window (she pretended not to notice), but it wasn’t quite the same. It would at least it would make for a good story, but things were starting to drag on, so it was time to make a move.</p><p class="double">“Luna… May I call you Luna?” She paused to let Nightmare Moon answer. The alicorn hesitated for a bit, but eventually nodded. Twilight smiled, this was a good sign. “I completely understand your desire to have your work validated. To see something you put so much work into completely ignored must have been devastating. You mentioned that your sister received plenty of attention for raising the sun. Do you think it would have hurt as much to have everypony ignore the night if that weren’t true?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was slow to answer. “Well it… it still would have hurt but… I… I suppose that seeing Tia getting all that attention might have made it worse…”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Would you say you were envious of the attention she was getting?” she asked, careful not to make it sound like an accusation.</p><p class="double">“M-maybe…” she said, but the way she sank into the chaise lounge implied a more definitive answer.</p><p class="double">“Did you ever tell her you were feeling neglected back then?”</p><p class="double">“She… she knew.”</p><p class="double">“Are you certain?” Twilight pressed.</p><p class="double">“Tia… Celestia knew everything... She... Nothing ever happened in the entire kingdom without her knowing about it… She had to know…” she answered, but her words sounded uncertain.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Perhaps that she was so busy maintaining a presence in Equestria’s politics was the reason she hadn’t noticed how you felt? Sometimes a pony can get so wrapped up in their work that they fail to notice how their friends and family are hurting.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon seemed to consider this, but didn’t respond at all. Objective one complete. Now for the other matter… “So then, this plan of yours, to make nighttime eternal, this is another attempt to get more ponies to notice the night sky?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon nodded. “Yes. They won’t be able to ignore the night anymore if it lasts forever.”</p><p class="double">“But don’t you think that could be counter-productive?” Nightmare Moon looked at her and raised an eyebrow. “What I mean is, ponies might <i>notice </i>the night sky, but since it comes at the cost of the day and the sun, it could cause them to resent it instead of admire it like you wanted.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon huffed. “Then so be it. They ignored me night after night and spent all of their time in the sun. They never cared about me, so why should I care about how they feel?”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a small smile. “You don’t mean that.”</p><p class="double">“You don’t know me.” she said, turning away.</p><p class="double">“No, but I know you care deeply about every one of your subjects. I know you were there fighting Discord alongside your sister,” she said. Nightmare Moon’s ears perked up, and she turned back towards Twilight.</p><p class="double">“You know about that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I do.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon stared at her for a moment, then turned away again. “Yes, I was there. And for a while, the ponies seemed to love me too. But years passed. Decades. Centuries, and I was forgotten. And as their love for me faded, so did mine.”</p><p class="double">“And yet, when you heard about King Sombra and the way he enslaved the Crystal Empire, you once again threw yourself against a powerful enemy in order to protect them,” Twilight added. “If what you say were true, you would have felt no obligation to help them.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon faced Twilight again with a disbelieving look on her face. “How do you know all this?”</p><p class="double">“Because I’ve been very thorough in researching my homeland’s history,” she said simply. It was at least partially true, but she felt it was best not to mention the whole truth for the moment. “You had no obligation to save Equestria from Discord. You could have left the ponies, my ancestor’s at his mercy and looked for a new land to settle in. But you saw ponies suffering under the rule of a reality-bending tyrant, and you, along with your sister, wanted to protect them. Not so you could rule over them, you did it because you couldn’t stand to see them in pain. It was the same for the Crystal Empire, am I right?”</p><p class="double">“I… yes…” she admitted. “But we failed. The Crystal Empire is gone.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe, but you protected Equestria from a potential invasion from King Sombra’s slave army. And more importantly, you fought for them. Your subjects, and the crystal ponies. You <i>did</i> care. And while the history books are vague on the exact dates of the events, the fall of the Crystal Empire and your rise as Nightmare Moon were what, a year apart? Two? Certainly not long enough for you to divorce yourself of that protective nature and empathy.” Nightmare Moon’s gaze met the floor. Twilight took that as a “yes”. “And your sister’s public presence? I’m willing to bet that one of the reasons that she managed to maintain such an outward image was because you were helping to keep Equestria running smoothly outside the public eye, correct?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was silent for a long while, then she spoke. “It doesn’t matter. I’ve already made my choice,” she nearly whispered.</p><p class="double">“But it does matter! It matters to <i>you</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Stop…”</p><p class="double">“You still care about them. About us, don’t you? You never <i>stopped</i> caring.”</p><p class="double">“I said stop!”</p><p class="double">“And that’s why it hurt so much. You <i>adored</i> your subjects, and yet they never seemed to return your affections. Even your sister didn’t seem to have as much time for you anymore.”</p><p class="double">“Please! Just stop talking!”</p><p class="double">“And that’s why you did it, isn’t it? The pain just became too much. You couldn’t hold it in any longer. So you thought, since loving them was too painful to bear, maybe you could try hating them instead. Scorning them. Replacing your unrequited affections with something less painful.”</p><p class="double">“<i><b>Be silent!</b></i>” Nightmare Moon boomed, getting to her feet and standing over the unicorn with a brightly glowing horn. She attempted to look as threatening as possible, and to a younger pony she may have. Twilight, however, was not young. She could see that the alicorn’s glare lacked a certain heat to it, her eyes were starting to well, and the subtle twitches of her mouth were clear indicators that she was struggling to keep her emotions under control. The floodgates were about to burst.</p><p class="double">“It won’t work, Princess. You can’t simply stop caring about them like that. Somepony like you, who loves her subjects with all her heart, could never bring herself to truly hate them, no matter how they wronged her.”</p><p class="double">“S-stop…” she said, her voice cracking. “I-if you don’t… I’ll…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “No, you won’t. Because you care. Because you would never forgive yourself if you did,” she spoke softly, and gave a soft smile. “And I care about you, too, Luna. So please, let me help you.”</p><p class="double">“H-help m-me?” she stammered.</p><p class="double">“Yes, help you. Please.” She stood up off her chair. “Let me be your friend.”</p><p class="double">Any hint of aggression melted away right there. Nightmare Moon opened her mouth, but only a small hiccup escaped. She tried to regain her composure, closing her mouth and squeezing her eyes shut to hold back the tears, but it was too late. Her legs buckled under her and she fell to the floor weeping. Twilight slowly moved beside her, and leaned down, gently stroking her back.</p><p class="double">“It’s okay. Let it all out.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn kept crying for several minutes, with Twilight by her side to comfort her. As the minutes passed, Twilight noticed that the black mare’s coat was disappearing, the corruption seeping down her coat like runny makeup onto the floor. Before long, all that was left of Nightmare Moon was a puddle of black on the floor and armor far too large for Luna’s redeemed form.</p><p class="double">“I’m sorry… I’m so sorry,” she whimpered, clinging to Twilight and crying into her chest. “I’m a horrible pony… I..”</p><p class="double">“None of that,” Twilight commanded, but kept her voice low. “You’re a wonderful pony, Luna. Equestria was worse off without you, and we’re lucky to have you back.”</p><p class="double">“Those ponies… they’ll never forgive me… Tia will never forgive me…”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “Oh yes they will. You haven’t done anything that can’t be fixed. And once they meet you, the <i>real</i> you, I know they’ll warm up to you, too.” Twilight turned towards her window. &quot;Right, everypony?&quot;</p><p class="double">Realizing they&#039;d been spotted, Twilight&#039;s non-looping PFFs and number one assistant ducked beneath the window frame. Twilight rolled her eyes. As if she hadn&#039;t already seen them and called them out. &quot;Come on girls. You were all so wonderful to me when I got here this morning. Princess Luna needs that now more than I ever did, you aren’t going to deny her friendship over a choice she regrets making, are you? And I <i>know</i> I taught you better than that, Spike. The door&#039;s unlocked. Come inside.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence once again overtook the library turned psychiatrists office. Luna gave Twilight a worried look, but the unicorn assured her that they’d come. After a few moments passed, but the group finally proved her right. They walked in slowly, and stood in front of the pair, their eyes wandering between Luna, Twilight and each other as they tried to decide what to say. </p><p class="double">Twilight decided to help move things along. “Princess Luna, these are my friends. The baby dragon is Spike, my number one assistant. He was raised by your sister until she put him under my care. The five ponies are my friends. I only just met them when I came into Ponyville, but they’ve been some of the kindest and friendliest souls I’ve ever met. They can help you win back Ponyville’s trust.”</p><p class="double">Spike stepped up first. “Well, I’m not sure how I can help but, I forgive you. You don’t seem like a bad pony to me, and Twilight’s right. Your sister helped raise me, and she taught me better than to hold a grudge against somepony that just made a bad choice.”</p><p class="double">“Ab-so-lutely!” Applejack exclaimed, moving forward and smiling at Luna. “Ah know Ah probably haven’t given the night the attention it rightly deserves, but Ah reckon without it, the sun would just shrivel everythin’ Ah try tah grow right up. Ah figure ah owe you big for that, so forgivin’ yah is just the start of it fer me.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, what she said,” Rainbow Dash added. “I’m uhh, I’m not too good at these kinds of speeches, but I totally get what it’s like to have something awesome you make go unnoticed. I mean, when I was a filly, I did a sonic rainboom, and nopony noticed.” She threw her hooves up. “It’s a <i>giant rainbow explosion in the sky!</i> How do you <i>miss</i> that!?” She let out a big sigh. “Anyway, yeah, I totally get where you’re coming from, so I forgive you, too.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed, I can only imagine how it would feel if every single one of my works were ignored,” Rarity stated as she walked up to Luna and inspected the oversized armor she was wearing. “Although I have to say, your taste in accessories could use some work.” She levitated the helmet and armor off of the alicorn. “Stand up, dear? Good, now let’s get you out of that tacky footwear. Yes, that’s better. Hmm, those ponies don’t know what they’re missing. Why, with a coat like yours, and a little work, I’m certain you could shine brighter than the sun. Figuratively speaking, of course.”</p><p class="double">“And I’ll throw you a big ‘Welcome to Ponyville/Welcome Back to Equestria/Thanks for Not Making Night Last Forever’ Party!” Pinkie shouted. To illustrate her point, she pulled a cord that released a bunch of streamers, balloons, confetti and a “Welcome to Ponyville/Welcome Back to Equestria/Thanks for Not Making Night Last Forever!” banner from the ceiling. Everypony stared at her in disbelief.</p><p class="double">“But when-” Twilight began to ask, but stopped herself. No matter how many loops she went through she would never get a satisfactory answer to Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued. “Don’t worry, everypony comes to my parties, and it will be a great chance for everypony to get to know you and have a great time doing it!”</p><p class="double">Luna stared at Pinkie for a second, then looked at the one pony in the room who had yet to speak. “And you? Do you forgive me, too?”</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus hid behind her own mane even as she answered. “Um… Yes. I wasn’t ever really angry. I was more worried about my animal friends. Some of them don’t see very well at night. But um, I’m glad you aren’t doing that anymore. Thank you.”</p><p class="double">Luna looked at each of her seven new friends and, finally, gave them a small, touched smile. “Thank you. Thank you all so much.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie latched onto her new Princess/friend in a big hug, surprising Luna. Twilight followed next, then Spike, Rarity, and eventually the whole group. With all her new friends embracing her, some fresh tears began to form in the night Princess’s eyes. Ones not of sadness, but of joy. Happier than she could remember being for millennia, Luna hugged them back. She finally had everything she ever wanted. Who would have known it would be so easy?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“I can’t believe what you’ve managed to accomplish today, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia and Twilight sat side by side as the Summer Sun Celebration went into full swing. Princess Luna herself was engaging in many of the festivities along with her new friends, as well as several townsfolk that had since taken a liking to her. Currently, that meant going head to head with Pinkie in a cupcake eating contest, with half the town cheering them on.</p><p class="double">“It was nothing, really Princess. You sister just needed a friend. I knew I could get to her.”</p><p class="double">“I have to admit, when you came to me saying you could redeem Luna without the Elements of Harmony I was very confused. You knew so much I thought I had hidden from you so well. I honestly feared for <i>your </i>mental state when you began to talk about these… time loops.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “But you always give me the benefit of the doubt. And look at the results.”</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled. “Indeed. If only I had known the answer was so simple.”</p><p class="double">“Speaking of which, I have you scheduled to join us at our next session on Tuesday.”</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked and looked down at Twilight. “Wait, <i>me?</i> But-”</p><p class="double">Twilight held up a hoof to cut her off. “Now, now, I won’t take no for an answer. I’m sensing centuries of bad air between you two, and I intend to see you two through it. The sooner we get this out of the way the better. Procrastination isn’t going to help anypony.” She said with finality. “I’m going to go and join my friends. Enjoy the festival, Princess!”</p><p class="double">With that, Twilight trotted away, leaving a shocked Princess Celestia behind her. Twilight giggled to herself. Sometimes looping could be so much fun. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>28.4 (NutJob)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>(Youngster Quartet, Part 1)</b></p><p class="double">“Okay, seriously, what the fluffy kittens is up with this loop?”</p><p class="double">Twilight managed to suppress a laugh, barely, to spare her rainbow-hued friend from further humiliation. They were walking through Ponyville in what was quickly becoming a contender for the most bizarre loop Twilight has ever experienced, and considering the weight that statement alone carried with it she could understand her friend’s aggravation.</p><p class="double">The loop itself seemed fairly standard at first. She awoke in Ponyville alongside Spike, and a quick check revealed that the other Elements were Awake as well. While it was unusual Awakening in Ponyville, she had certainly awoken to some far less welcome sights. Things only started to get weird when the other loopers started showing up.</p><p class="double">Twilight recognized many of them, familiar faces from past adventures and old friends she’d been hoping to see again for… Well, to be honest she wasn’t sure. Keeping track of time was difficult as a looper. Others were new faces, some eager to become friends, some new, inexperienced loopers, and some were kind of moody jerks, and every single one of them retained their original form. In any case, Ponyville quickly became flooded with them, and eventually Twilight had to inform Mayor Mare that Ponyville had apparently become the temporary home of several… hundred interdimensional travelers, each with a multitude of lifetime experiences with varying degrees of mental stability. All things considered, she took it quite well after Twilight pointed out granting them residency in Ponyville would secure the majority vote in the coming election. At the time, the looping unicorn thought her biggest challenge would be to prevent so many people from so many cultures from tearing each others eyes out.</p><p class="double">This was before she discovered the loops second oddity.</p><p class="double">“Oh, man,” Rainbow moaned, covering her face with her hooves. “I can&#039;t believe I said that to him. I’m never going to live this down.”</p><p class="double">On top of being the single biggest example of a fused loop she had ever seen, it was also an altered loop with some very strange rules. As far as she could tell no one, whether they be pony, human or otherwise, could say or perform any action that might be considered &quot;inappropriate for children&quot;. On top of that, some of the items the loopers had brought with them had been physically altered, as well. Weapons turned into toys or candy, for example, or cigarettes into lollipops. At first, Twilight thought that one of the loopers might have been responsible for everyone&#039;s uncharacteristic behavior, but after she got word of other parts of Equestria being affected, and several thorough tests of her new neighbors abilities, she concluded that none of them had the resources or power needed to pull off such a feat. At least not without using a massive amount of easily traceable energy, which there was no evidence of.</p><p class="double">It took some time, but eventually most of the loopers had found ways to deal with it. Most treated the loop as a vacation, as the universe was forced into a state of perpetual peace, and the Princesses (Thankfully, also Awake) and mayor helped see to it that each of them was well accommodated. Still, there were a fair amount of troublemakers that tried to “overload” the loop’s censorship, which usually just resulted in their words and actions being more heavily altered, but that didn’t stop them from trying. And when one such looper had started instigating Rainbow Dash, it quickly devolved into what would have been a heated argument between the two, had the universe not decided to make things awkward for them.</p><p class="double">“Oh, come on, Rainbow. It wasn’t that bad! Some of the other loopers have been thrown into far more embarrassing situations than you,” Twilight offered. “Remember when Laharl and Etna accidentally promised to start a circus?&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a smile out of the pegasus. Baby steps. “Yeah, that was great. Flonne wouldn’t let that one go until they made it happen. Gotta admit, Midboss and Pinkie were great on the trapeze.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I thought Captain Gordon made a great clown, myself. And how about that time Megatron transformed into a Carousel?”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash let out a chuckle. Almost there. “Okay, yeah. I don’t think anyone saw that coming.”</p><p class="double">“And need I remind you about the nine-tailed fox?” she snickered, pointing a hoof towards the Everfree forest, where the remains of the worlds biggest piñata was visible over the treeline.</p><p class="double">This finally seemed to get the pegasus’s thoughts off of her earlier humiliation long enough to share a short but refreshing laugh with her unicorn friend. “Okay, okay, yeah. I mean, I guess I don’t have it too bad compared to all that,” she admitted.</p><p class="double">“Exactly,” Twilight agreed, smiling. “Besides, I’m sure Wolverine knows you didn&#039;t actually mean any of that.&quot; Her smile suddenly transformed into a mischievous grin. &quot;Although I have to say I&#039;m sure it would have been quite the wedding.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus cheeks went from light blue to bright red and she shot Twilight a glare that could melt glaciers. Thankfully, as a countless number of loops had made her considerably more resilient and an oversized block of ice, the unicorn felt comfortable staring back smugly. Still, it was short-lived, as the second Rainbow Dash opened her mouth to retort she was blindsided by an orange blur that sent her crashing several yards through the ground.</p><p class="double">For an instance, Twilight worried that someone had actually succeeded in beating the universal censorship, but one look into the newly formed trench and those fears were lifted. She would recognize that black, spiky hair anywhere, and she knew its owner wasn&#039;t the type to attack someone out of the blue.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops. Sorry, Rainbow Dash. That was a little rougher than I was going for.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh, Goku!? What the happy meals is wrong with you? And what are you hugging me for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s because...&quot; the saiyan trailed off, his face twisting in confusion. “Actually, I’m not sure. I just felt like I really had to hug you, for some reason.”</p><p class="double">“What? But that-” she started, confused, before she put the pieces together and her expression morphed into one of irritation. <i><b>“Pinkie Pie!”</b></i></p><p class="double">“Yessssss, Rainbow Dash?” the pink mare responded, poking her head out from the mound of dirt that had been created beside the trench.</p><p class="double">“Did you write my name in the Hug Note again!?”</p><p class="double">“Mmmmaaayyyyyybe.”</p><p class="double">For the second time in five minutes, Twilight found herself resisting the urge to laugh. And judging from the snickering she heard coming from behind her, she wasn’t the only one. By this point a mass of ponies and visiting loopers had gathered around the crash site. She knew most of them had been drawn by good intentions, rushing over to offer help if someone had been injured, and although tempting as it was to let them stick around and enjoy the show, she felt Rainbow Dash’s ego had taken enough of a beating for one day.</p><p class="double">“Okay, everyone! Nothing to see here, move along now!” she called out, shooing the onlookers away. The crowd slowly started to disperse, with several ponies and especially loopers trying to sneak a few more glances before Twilight personally forced them away. Once they were free of any unwelcome onlookers, Twilight turned back and climbed into the trench to assist her friends.</p><p class="double">“Goku, you mind getting off me now?” Rainbow Dash asked with a hint of irritation in her voice.</p><p class="double">“Uh, yeah.” Goku sheepishly rose to his feet. After helping Rainbow Dash off the ground, the saiyan scratched the back of his head. “Heheh… Uh, sorry about all that.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash waved her hoof. “Don’t worry about it. It wasn’t really your fault anyway. I’m gonna have a talk with-” She was cut off as Goku suddenly scooped the pegasus off the and pulled her against his chest once again. The two stared at each blankly for a moment, before Goku offered Rainbow Dash an apologetic smile, and Rainbow Dash closed her eyes and gritted her teeth in irritation. “<i>Pinkie Pie.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Wud?” the earth pony asked, looking up from her notebook with a pen clenched in her teeth.</p><p class="double">“Pinkie, don’t you think poor Rainbow Dash has had enough hugs for one day?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“That’s silly, Twilight! Nopony can <i>ever</i> get enough hugs in one day!” Pinkie replied, causing Twilight to roll her eyes. “Besides, I know what you’re <i>really </i>asking. And don’t worry, I wrote your name in here right after Dashie’s!”</p><p class="double">“Pinkie!”</p><p class="double">“Also, I hope you don’t mind but I really wanted to see what would happen if I wrote someone’s name more than once.”</p><p class="double">“You wrote my name in the Note <i>twice</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Noooooooooooo.”</p><p class="double">“What? But then…”</p><p class="double">Twilight was distracted by the distant sound of rumbling. Suddenly, the meaning of of Pinkie’s words became all too clear. “Pinkie… How many times did you write my name in there?”</p><p class="double">“Um, I wasn’t keeping track. Oh, I know, why don’t you ask them?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie pointed behind Twilight. The unicorn almost didn’t look, as she had a pretty good idea as to who “they” were, considering that Pinkie had pointed in the direction of the rumbling. <i>I could just teleport away, right now, </i>she thought. <i>Maybe to Canterlot, or the Crystal Empire. Or the moon.</i> All seemed like, at this particular point in time, a much safer place to be. But realistically, she knew it wouldn’t help. Once her name was written in the notebook her fate was sealed, and with all the loopers and their means of transportation it wasn’t as though she could run, either. She took in a deep breath and turned around.</p><p class="double">And saw the entire population of Ponyville running at her as if someone cast the Want-It-Need-It spell on her.</p><p class="double">“Oh <i>fluff me</i>.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“...and I promise never to write anyone’s name in the Hug Note more than once at one time ever again. Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.” Pinkie finished, going through all the necessary motions.</p><p class="double">“Good, thank you Pinkie. Could you go let Spike know I won’t be home for a few days?”</p><p class="double">“Sure. Sorry again, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“That’s okay, Pinkie.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded slowly and left, and Twilight let out a sigh as Nurse Redheart finish adjusting her bed. Now this was something. How many lifetimes has it been since the last time she wore a full body cast? Of all the thousands of horrible loops she could have ended up confined to a hospital bed, this was about the <i>last</i> loop she would have considered this a possibility. Oh well, it wasn’t as though she was terribly busy this loop.</p><p class="double">“I don’t see why you don’t just Ascend or cast a bone-mending spell or something,” Rainbow Dash stated. “If you’re afraid that you’ll mess up your magic or something like that, I can do it for you. Just tell me how the spell works, I’ll go Ascend and have you back up in a jiffy.”</p><p class="double">“It’s not that, Rainbow, but thank you.” Rainbow Dash raised an eyebrow at this, so Twilight continued. “Right now, crazy as it sounds, Pinkie Pie is the most dangerous threat to Equestria. The Hug Note is one of the few things in this entire loop that’s capable of actually hurting someone, and Pinkie was treating it like a toy. In all honesty, I’m just glad that she learned this lesson with me and not someone else.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, well, she Pinkie promised not to do it again. Do you really need to stick around here now?</p><p class="double">“She Pinkie promised not to write anyone’s name more than once at one time, but she’s started experimenting with the notebook and that’s a problem in itself. What if she decides somebody needs a <i>really</i> big hug? You want to find out what it feels like to be hugged by a gundam?” Rainbow Dash answered with a wince. “I thought not. As for my decision to stay here, well, let’s face it. Part of Pinkie’s charm is that even despite being technically older than the Princesses at this point, she hasn’t seemed to grow up one bit. I don’t want her thinking that what happened wasn’t a big deal just because I can fix it right away. I’m hoping that staying here a couple of days will make her think her actions through a little better in the future.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash mused that over. “I guess that makes sense. Alright, well if you’re sure, anything you need me to grab for you before I head out?”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm… actually, now that I think about it, could you stop by the library and grab as many erotic books as you can find? I want to see how the loop affected them. It should be good for a laugh.”</p><p class="double">“Ha! That’s sounds like fun, maybe I’ll join you. Alright, I’ll be back in a minute. Don’t go anywhere!” the pegasus teased as she opened a window and flew out.”</p><p class="double">“Oh hah, hah!” she called back, knowing full well her friend was already well out of earshot. Still, an amused smile formed on her face. This was surely one of the stranger loops she’d ever experienced, but also easily one of the most peaceful. To be honest, it was nice to be able to just relax with no strings attached. One loop where she could just pretend she was a normal unicorn that didn’t have to constantly fight chaotic gods and eldritch abominations. She took notice a small glass of water on a table beside her, and telekinetically raise it to the air.</p><p class="double">“Here’s to you, you wonderfully bizarre flopping loop.”</p><p class="double"></p><p>28.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle walked down the stairs to the dungeons, shooting Celestia a worried look. &quot;And you&#039;re saying this... assassin wanted to talk to me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... to be completely accurate, she wanted to speak to Princess Twilight.&quot; The alicorn of the sun looked down at her student. &quot;I hardly know of any such pony, but given that you are my student I assumed there could be a level of... confusion regarding your rank.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn nodded, keeping her thoughts to herself. Celestia wasn&#039;t awake this loop, so of course she was unaware of Twilight&#039;s more powerful abilities. The fact that this prisoner <i>was</i> implied that she was looping, but being referred to as Princess by any of her friends was quite unusual. Therefore, it wouldn&#039;t be out of the question to assume that the assassin was a new looper...</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you ever figure out why she attacked you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia sighed. &quot;Apparently I&#039;m... some sort of tyrant that enslaves ponies. And I managed to escape from the moon and rewrite history somehow. I think she may be a tad delusional....&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced, remembering a rather disturbing loop. If the pony in question had woken up <i>then,</i> there was plenty of reason to distrust Celestia. &quot;So... what exactly is this pony like, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s the thing,&quot; her mentor said sadly. &quot;She&#039;s not a pony.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh raised an eyebrow, quietly refilling the mug with cider as Twilight gently patted the shoulders of a sobbing, heartbroken Chrysalis.</p><p class="double">He didn&#039;t exactly have a full understanding of the situation--it wasn&#039;t his place to pry--but from what he had gathered, the last loop that the changeling queen had been in had her married to Shining Armor, of all ponies. Shining hadn&#039;t been Awake, of course, but Chrysalis had been. In fact, if he was reading this right, that was her <i>first</i> loop, and she had interpreted her memories of the baseline loop as some horrific nightmare.</p><p class="double">And then she&#039;d woken up here, once again Queen of the Changeling Swarm and....</p><p class="double">&quot;I AM A MOOOOOOOOOOOONSTEEEEEEEEER!&quot; Chrysalis wailed. She heaved forward with another sob, her silky mane spooling around and into the mug. &quot;I don&#039;t deserve to live; I don&#039;t deserve any, any of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, Chrysalis, you&#039;re not really that bad.&quot; Twilight rubbed her shoulders gently, watching as she took another gulp of alcohol. &quot;As... aggressive as your invasion plan usually is, it&#039;s always started by a need to feed your hive. You just... have a few, um... sympathy issues, that&#039;s all.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shot Macintosh the look of the desperately flailing. He coughed and nodded. &quot;Family is family. Ah can&#039;t tell ya how many loops I fought off timberwolves or joined tha army to protect Apple Bloom and AJ. Ya&#039;ll were acting in tha best interests of yer kin, Ah can respect that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sniffed. &quot;You... you really think that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure as tha sun.&quot; The stallion nodded. &quot;You look after yer own. Ya just need ta learn ta look after others, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a vague nod, the queen of the changelings straightened slightly.</p><p class="double">Then she broke down crying again. &quot;But, but, but.... Shining. I loved... loved him, and... and it turns out that I, was just playing him--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>That</i> Shining Armor loved you too,&quot; Twilight interjected quickly. &quot;<i>That</i> Shining Armor was somepony that you... What I&#039;m saying is, you didn&#039;t hurt him. I was in that loop, Chrysalis, and I saw how deeply you two were....&quot; She sighed. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I really am. He wasn&#039;t awake that loop, so the looping version of him won&#039;t... remember. Just... you didn&#039;t hurt him, remember that. In that loop, you didn&#039;t--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance was awake, wasn&#039;t she?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn snapped her mouth shut.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis turned to glower at her. &quot;Wasn&#039;t. She.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, very reluctantly, gave a small nod.</p><p class="double">The changeling nodded back. &quot;I&#039;m a monster. I&#039;m a complete... complete monster...&quot; She reached for her mug again.</p><p class="double">Macintosh pulled it out of her reach with a snort. &quot;So what? Ya think just cause ya made a few mistakes ya&#039;ll can just take the monster label and run with it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. &quot;It&#039;s not like I have a choice.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya know what Ah saw when Ah started looping?&quot; Macintosh pointed at the unicorn. &quot;This pony right here transformed into a Nightmare. Called herself Eternal Twilight, turned Spike into a massive dragon... Ah was completely terrified. Turned out ta be a one-loop prank she was pulling.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aheh heh heh.&quot; The mare inched away from Chrysalis&#039;s incredulous look. &quot;Looping does kind of make ponies a tad crazy...&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh rolled her eyes. &quot;It wasn&#039;t till a lot later that Twilight even figgered Ah was looping. And that was only cause she noticed a lot of things that weren&#039;t happening that shoulda been. Ah&#039;d been so terrified of her that Ah&#039;d tried ta keep mah whole condition secret... and it turned out she was, well, Twilight. Not some evil monster, but just a pony that happened ta have been living tha same period over and over again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shut her eyes, rubbing at them with a hoof. &quot;What exactly are you trying to say here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;m saying... Look. Even if ya <i>are</i> a monster, you can change. Ah mean, even tha baseline has Nightmare Moon and Discord reforming.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because they made friends,&quot; the changeling queen grumbled. &quot;Or got shot in the face with the Elements.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then make some friends!&quot; Twilight said brightly. &quot;Heck, I&#039;m sure Pinkie will warm up to you quickly. And Fluttershy <i>ascended</i> because of you, so now that you&#039;re looping she&#039;d love to chat.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. &quot;What do you mean Fluttershy ascended because of me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um... long story, but basically you can&#039;t turn into an alicorn unless you&#039;ve become an alicorn in a previous loop, and that kind of requires specific things for each pony, and Fluttershy is the element of Kindness so...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See?&quot; Macintosh pressed. &quot;Ya have some friends already. Heck, Twilight busted ya out of jail to drag ya here for a drink.&quot; He offered the mug back to her. &quot;That there takes some real nerve.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, technically I claimed she was my cousin who ended up messing with an experimental spell and, um, Celestia agreed to release her to my care.&quot; Twilight rubbed the back of her head. &quot;I&#039;m amazed she bought that.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen looked at the proffered cider. &quot;....I... I still love Shining. My version, anyway. The one in that loop, I don&#039;t know if the looping Shining is different... I&#039;m never going to get to find out, am I?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;No, I... I&#039;m afraid you won&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded slowly. &quot;Are... either of them awake this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn took a moment to consider the question. &quot;...Chrysalis... you&#039;re not going to be able to maintain a relationship with ponies when they&#039;re not awake. It just.... doesn&#039;t work, there&#039;s not a deep connection.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You didn&#039;t answer my question.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t want you to get hurt.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen took the mug and sipped it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look... let&#039;s just take it slowly, okay?&quot; Twilight smiled gently. &quot;Me and the other elements will deal with Nightmare Moon and Discord and Sombra and all those other things, but other then that this loop is to help you ease in. Alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I suppose I have to start somewhere,&quot; Chrysalis replied glumly. &quot;I doubt I could ever redeem myself...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.6</p><p class="double">“…I’d like to show you something…” Fluttershy said quietly.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis cocked her head, trying not to wince as another memory ran through her. She’d have to get used to them sooner or later, it wouldn’t be possible to have a conversation if every reminder of what she’d lost threw her off.</p><p class="double">Not to mention how much it might confuse the rest of the hive mind.</p><p class="double">“What is it?” she asked, pushing her reminiscence aside as best she could.</p><p class="double">“Watch.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy’s eyes closed, and she exhaled deeply and evenly.</p><p class="double">There was a moment of timeless fluidity, and then there was a wolf standing there.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis jumped, her wings buzzing. “What-”</p><p class="double">The wolf’s tongue lolled out for a moment, and Chrysalis noticed the laughter in its eyes.</p><p class="double">“It’s still me,” the wolf said in Fluttershy’s gentle soprano. “I picked this up somewhere. It’s called Wild Shape.”</p><p class="double">“…huh, it is,” the Changeling Queen said slowly. Now she was concentrating, her empathic sense could still detect the sunny warmth of Fluttershy’s emotions. “Where’d you learn that?”</p><p class="double">“Oerth.” The wolf sat back, gesturing with a paw, and Chrysalis landed again before stepping forwards. “It’s part of being what’s called a druid. I’m more… in tune with nature.”</p><p class="double">“Neat.” </p><p class="double">“Actually,” Fluttershy looked down, “I was wondering… what are the limits of your shapeshifting?”</p><p class="double">“I’ve never really tested them.” Chrysalis shrugged. “As far as I know, I can’t do much more than taking on the shape of a pony, though <i>what</i> pony is quite malleable.”</p><p class="double">She winced again. Even the smallest things seemed to be making her remember her loss. It wasn’t even clear <i>what</i> had done it that time…</p><p class="double">“Well,” there was another fluid moment, and Fluttershy was back to being a pegasus. “I think I know a project for us to work on. We could try and push the limits of what you can pull off, changing shape, I mean. If that’s okay with you.”</p><p class="double">“That does sound like a good idea,” Chrysalis nodded. “But why are you helping me?”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Fluttershy replied, genuinely puzzled – Chrysalis could sense the polite confusion like a pure musical note.</p><p class="double">“I… I invaded your country! Hundreds of times!”</p><p class="double">“No you didn’t.” Fluttershy reached out a hoof. “<i>You</i> haven’t. A not-Looping version of you did. You’re not guilty of her crimes.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. “I have to believe that you think that – I can <i>sense</i> that you believe that – but <i>I</i> don’t believe it myself.”</p><p class="double">“That’s okay.” Fluttershy giggled. “I used to be <i>terrible</i> at that. Okay, shall we do this?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shook her wings. “Not as though I have a choice, is it…”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no, I wouldn’t dream of forcing you.” Fluttershy backed off. “But you really <i>would</i> enjoy the challenge, I’m sure…”</p><p class="double">Then she got a mischievous glint in her eyes. Faint, but one that would startle somepony from the baseline loop. “And I do think that it might let you play a prank or two.”</p><p class="double">“Pranks?” Chrysalis repeated, feeling vaguely silly in having to ask so many questions.</p><p class="double">“Well, I don’t do them much myself, but I understand that Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie enjoy them, and they’re good to let off steam, and they don’t hurt anyone, and…”</p><p class="double">“Alright, I get the picture.” The Changeling Queen held up a hoof, cutting off Fluttershy’s long list. “Right, let’s get started. How is it that you’re changing the shape of the ears?”</p><p class="double">“Oh!” Fluttershy rummaged in her mane for a moment, and pulled a biology textbook from her subspace pocket. “Right, here. You see how the attachment of the muscles differs? Aside from that, the main issue is…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">28.7</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle sat back, kicking the table leg. It wasn’t much fun when the other Crusaders weren’t Looping, though on comparing notes they’d more or less mutually agreed that whichever one of them <i>was</i> looping should act like a cool big sister type of person. (Based on the reactions of the non-looping others, being around a pony their age who was clearly more self confident and yet who <i>wasn’t</i> condescending was actually pretty cool.)</p><p class="double">But the important thing was that she was waiting on her sister. Rarity had decided to upgrade their cloaks, and had asked Sweetie to take her next test examples over to their clubhouse… once they were finished with, anyway.</p><p class="double">There was a knock at the door.</p><p class="double">Sweetie glanced at the clock as she walked over. Five P.M. <i>Huh, must be taking her longer than she planned… it’ll be dinner soon, and if I’m going to go over to ‘bloom’s house for tea like I was going to then I’ll need to leave fairly sharpish.</i></p><p class="double">As she turned the handle, she rattled off the well-memorized message Rarity had taught her to. “Hello, welcome to Carousel Boutique. I’m afraid we’re not open right this moment, but we’ll take orders outside hours if… possible?”</p><p class="double">She trailed off, staring.</p><p class="double">“Spike? What are you doing here?”</p><p class="double">Spike looked down at Sweetie for a few seconds, then his eyes widened and he swept a bunch of lilies behind his back to hide them. “Oh, uh, Sweetie. Nice to see you.”</p><p class="double">“Do you have flowers behind your back?”</p><p class="double">“No…” Spike said slowly, in the face of evidence.</p><p class="double">“Whatever.” Sweetie shrugged. “Hey, sis! Your date’s here!”</p><p class="double">Rarity appeared with a flash of light. “Oh, sorry, I didn’t realize the time… wait, my what?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie rolled her eyes. “You two are <i>not</i> subtle. I’ve known for ages.”</p><p class="double">“You have?” both of them repeated in unison.</p><p class="double">“Hey, that was cool,” Sweetie said. “Anyway, yeah, it’s just <i>obvious</i> by now.”</p><p class="double">A grin stole across her face. “Wait, did you think you were managing to keep it secret from me?”</p><p class="double">“Er…” Spike scratched the back of his head with the hand not holding the flowers. “…yes, actually.”</p><p class="double">“I wasn’t sure what you’d think, Sweetie,” Rarity said with a blush. “I know I should have mentioned it, but…”</p><p class="double">“You were worried about that?” Sweetie looked Spike up and down. “He’s a dragon. That’s about as cool as potential brothers in law <i>get</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Fine, then…” Spike brought the flowers out. “Here, Rares. I know you like them.”</p><p class="double">The bouquet rose out of his hands wrapped in alabaster light. “I do, you’re right.” Selecting one from the centre of the bunch, Rarity nibbled it delicately and put the rest in a vase for later. “Much healthier than chocolates. Now, where are we going?”</p><p class="double">Spike produced a pair of tickets. “Well, it’s getting harder to find a new place to go, but… how do you feel about a classical music performance with Trixie doing a light and magic show?”</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked. “How did <i>that</i> come about?”</p><p class="double">“I am not entirely sure…” Spike shrugged. “Could be that Twilight sent Trixie off to that classicist-”</p><p class="double">“Octavia,” Rarity supplied.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that’s right. Twilight sent Trixie off to Octavia and her friend Vinyl after she turned up here. In any case, the programme says they’re doing Beethoofen, so that should be nice.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, that sounds fine.” Rarity paused. “I know it’s probably not as low profile as it could be, but… I’d actually like to fly there.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” At her nod, Spike tapped his chin. “Fair enough, then. Pegasus or alicorn?”</p><p class="double">“Pegasus.” Rarity matched deed to word, flashing through ascension and then down the other side with wings instead of her horn. “I do still feel nervous flying alone, I don’t think that’ll ever go away entirely, but… not with you.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie ostentatiously turned her back as the others shared a long look.</p><p class="double">“Hey,” she said, after a minute or so, “should I just head off to Applebloom’s, then?”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Rarity replied, distractedly. “You’ve got your key?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn filly got out of there in case they started kissing.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<br /><p class="double">29.1 (TiaC)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, Dash, now that we&#039;ve dealt with everything important for the foreseeable future, what are you going to be doing next? I don&#039;t spend much time on Earth as a pony myself, so I thought I&#039;d try travelling to the Amazon.&quot; asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m gonna practice my weather handling. I&#039;m good, but I could be better and this is just the loop to get there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dash! &#039;Ten seconds flat!&#039; now describes you dissipating a hurricane. Any storm that could challenge you would devastate the planet! Please tell me you don&#039;t plan to conjure up super-storms to practice. I don&#039;t want to have to clean up after you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Chill Twi, I got this. It won&#039;t be a problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll trust you Rainbow, but I will be very upset if you end up hurting someone.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You did what!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Told you I could get some practice here. Beautiful, isn&#039;t it? Definitely one for the scrapbook.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two ponies looked down at the headline. <b>Great Red Spot Vanishes! Astronomers Baffled!</b></p><p class="double">&quot;How did you even… It&#039;s larger than Earth!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Was</i> larger than Earth.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.2</p><p class="double">“Right, that looks about done,” Trixie said, double-checking the calculations. “Right there.”</p><p class="double">“Cool,” Gilda said, bouncing a ball off the wall. “So this’ll work?”</p><p class="double">“…probably.” Trixie shrugged. “Not as though Trixie can test it ahead of time, is it?”</p><p class="double">“Fair point.” Flaring her wings, the griffin slapped the ball off to one side and pinged it with her tail. “So, when do we start?”</p><p class="double">“Tomorrow morning.” Trixie reached into nowhere, and pulled out a mini-barrel of beer. “One each for luck?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Gilda got the glasses out, and Trixie cracked the top to pour it.</p><p class="double">“I don’t remember seeing these before…” Gilda mused.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Trixie shrugged. “Applejack introduces them sometimes. They’re based off beer <i>cans</i>, which humans often use – but we just don’t have the aluminium extraction capacity to manage them easily, and we ponies prefer wood anyway.”</p><p class="double">“Huh. Cool.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, it is, isn’t it?” Trixie grinned. “Trixie cooled them down before putting them in her pocket, and put them in stasis. Cold beer on tap!”</p><p class="double">“…no, I meant the concept.”</p><p class="double">Trixie shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Queen Chrysalis smiled, her triumph at hand. Celestia was defeated, the Elements lay before her in various states of abject defeat… it was good to be the queen.</p><p class="double">“Well, so much for the mighty land of Equestria-” she paused, and frowned. “Who is that?”</p><p class="double">Everypony and every… ling, looked.</p><p class="double">There was a griffin standing against one wall, trying without much success to whistle nonchalantly.</p><p class="double">“What are you doing here?”</p><p class="double">“Playing.” With that one word answer, the Griffin picked up a dice and threw it. “All right, six! Perfect!”</p><p class="double">Stepping back, she revealed a large crank on the wall, and turned it.</p><p class="double">With a clunk, something came shooting out of the wall. It looked like…</p><p class="double">A stop sign.</p><p class="double">It hit a bucket on a stick which was hanging from one of the rafters. That in turn fell over, releasing a large metal ball, which went rolling down the steps outside in a long series of rumble-<i>thuds</i>.</p><p class="double">Something went <i>ping.</i></p><p class="double">Part of the palace plumbing collapsed, and a bathtub erupted through the roof in a shower of plaster. Through it fell a marble, which hit the firing catch of a guard’s crossbow, and that sent the bolt bouncing off three walls to cut through a rope.</p><p class="double">Every eye had been following this increasingly bizarre series of events, Chrysalis among them, and it took her a moment too long to realize that the rope was connected to a <i>very</i> large cage.</p><p class="double">“Mousetrap!” Gilda shouted. “Brilliant!”</p><p class="double">“…I feel terribly stupid…” Chrysalis muttered. Celestia made a noise of commiseration.</p><p class="double">Trixie walked into the hall from a side door. “Okay, you win. Want another go?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Gilda looked around. “Might need to find a different castle, though…”</p><p class="double">“There’s a nice one in Trottingham.” With a blue flash, both of them vanished.</p><p class="double">The bedraggled Princess Cadence looked at where the duo had been. “Wait, isn’t that the castle you gave Prince Blueblood?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.3</p><p class="double">Twilight looked back and forth across the group.</p><p class="double">“Right. How on Equestria are we going to sort this one out?”</p><p class="double">“Rotating evilness again?” Rarity suggested. “I know I’d like to see what we’ve all come up with since…”</p><p class="double">“True, true.” Twilight set up an easel, and took out cutie-mark markers. “Okay, there’s a total of…” she looked across the rest of the alicorns, counting under her breath. “I make it twelve, since Nyx and Trixie have joined us since the last time.”</p><p class="double">“Well, thirteen actually…” Dash put in. “Spike’s on the way here, he turned up the other side of the world. He’ll take a few days to get here.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight shrugged. “Who knows. Anyway, who goes evil first?”</p><p class="double">Nyx screwed up her face, her horn glowed, and with a <i>bang</i> she was eight feet tall and clad in spiky armour. <b>“Me please!”</b></p><p class="double">“…that’s very impressive,” Luna said, tilting her head. “How do you do the reverb?”</p><p class="double"><b>“This isn’t really armour,” </b>Nyx said helpfully. <b>“It’s my stereo from my subspace pocket. I just put an illusion on it. The volume knob’s the fourth spiky bit down on the left, and the bass is the one below it.”</b></p><p class="double">“Anyone else want to go first?” Twilight checked. “No? Good, looks like you get the slot then. Just one question, what’s your villain name?”</p><p class="double"><b>“Oh, that’s right, isn’t it, Nightmare Moon’s kind of redundant…”</b> The newly nominated villain trailed off. <b>“What about Dark Side?”</b></p><p class="double">“Could work,” Applejack allowed.</p><p class="double">“Yes, it sounds good,” Rarity added.</p><p class="double">The general murmur of agreement continued for a moment, then died away.</p><p class="double">“Well, that’s settled, then.” Twilight nodded to her. “Okay, here goes.”</p><p class="double">They all dove for cover.</p><p class="double"><b>“Muahahaha!” </b>the newly designated Dark Side laughed. <b>“I will… er… hang on, time out, I forgot to have an evil plan.”</b></p><p class="double">Trixie pulled off a sheet which had been disguising her as a rock. “I’ll help. I need some ideas myself… do you have a position open for a minion?”</p><p class="double">Nyx rubbed a hoof against her chin, pondering. <b>“Do you have experience in evil?”</b></p><p class="double">“I did once take over a town by using an evil amulet to gain dark powers?” Trixie volunteered helpfully.</p><p class="double"><b>“Hmmm…”</b></p><p class="double">“And I’ve got an evil plan for you to do.”</p><p class="double"><b>“Welcome to Team Evil!”</b> Nyx spread her wings welcomingly. <b>“We have dental.”</b></p><p class="double">“Really?” Trixie looked interested.</p><p class="double"><b>“It’s the fangs…”</b> Nyx trotted forward. <b>“What was this evil plan you were suggesting?”</b></p><p class="double">“Well-” Trixie began.</p><p class="double">There was a terrible screeching sound, and every alicorn clapped their hooves over their ears.</p><p class="double"><b>“Oh, oopsie! Sorry, I’m </b>having a bit of feedback…” Nyx shrugged, her spiky armour making popping noises. “I guess I broke it.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded sympathetically. “I once had a bad sound system. It went <i>really</i> wrong.”</p><p class="double">“How wrong?” Nyx asked, shrugging the repurposed stereo off and wrinkling her nose at the smell of frying insulation.</p><p class="double">“It played me really squeaky. I had to play it off as a comedy thing…”</p><p class="double">“Shouldn’t you have an evil plan by now?” Dash heckled.</p><p class="double">Nyx stiffened. “I think I just worked out my evil plan.”</p><p class="double">“What’s that, then, my lady?” Trixie said, turning to stand next to her.</p><p class="double">“Ooh, I like that…” Nyx shook her head. “Anyway, the plan is, smother Equestria in stage effects. The stage mist will last forever!”</p><p class="double">Lightning crashed.</p><p class="double">“You really are <i>very</i> good at that, by the way,” she added. “I can see this is going to work out well.”</p><p class="double">“Ye~es,” Trixie drew out the word, “but it does mean I have to come up with something for myself to do. Cover the sky in fireworks?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t words.</p><p class="double">Ponies wouldn&#039;t normally be able to understand, but... it wasn&#039;t words, exactly. Or images. Those cropped up sometimes, yes, when necessary. At its fundament, though, the Hive was raw self meeting raw self, communication on a basic level. All the changelings connected to it, and many that had been enveloped by it at their deaths, shifted and tumbled and understood each other in a vast ocean that somehow, itself, had gained an ancient, indecipherable intelligence.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed as the hive mind swirled around her. There weren&#039;t words, just... worry. Concern. They wanted to know if she was okay. They wanted to know why she had, very abruptly, cut herself off almost completely and charged right toward the heart of ponykind. They wanted to know what had happened, whether they could help.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d ignored it for two weeks. The concern had gotten stronger.</p><p class="double">Finally, she had politely excused herself back to the swarm&#039;s abode--Twilight had mentioned she spent a loop as the Changeling Queen so she understood the pressures of the Hive--and simply sat in her chambers. Then she let her memories flow.</p><p class="double">There was... some confusion. Some. But it faded quickly.</p><p class="double">There weren&#039;t words, but if there were the hive would be saying that she should have told them sooner so that they could comfort her.</p><p class="double">The drones approached gently, nuzzling at her as she once more sobbed...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there Chrysalis, Fluttershy wanted to know if... you...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared.</p><p class="double">In the centre of the room was Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings..... and Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">And Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">Aaaaaand Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">And, oh look, Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">And, yet again, Shining Armor</p><p class="double">And, of course, Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">.....and Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">Shining Armor was there as well.</p><p class="double">Twilight recognized her brother amongst the crowd.</p><p class="double">The captain of the guard looked back at her.</p><p class="double">A white unicorn with a blue mane had frozen at her entrance.</p><p class="double">Cadance&#039;s beau coughed, awkwardly.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis held up a hoof. &quot;I swear, this wasn&#039;t my idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, slowly.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Look, the hive mind was worried and I let them know what was going on and one thing led to another--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not like we did anything serious!&quot; the changeling queen reassured her. &quot;We just cuddled!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis would have been sweating bullets if changelings had sweat glands. &quot;Come on, after what I&#039;ve been through I think I deserve a coping mechanism that doesn&#039;t involve alcohol!&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shrugged. &quot;You may have a point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, okay? I just... I was weak, and I&#039;m sorry, and--&quot;</p><p class="double">A purple hoof cut her off. Twilight was giving her a sympathetic look. &quot;Hey. I know how it feels to lose somepony you love to the loops. I&#039;ve been awake for, oh, who knows how long now. I get it, you messed up, and... well, I&#039;m a little bit annoyed that this happened and I&#039;m going to keep it for blackmail but really, it&#039;s not nearly as bad as it could have been.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis drooped. &quot;I don&#039;t know how you can possibly forgive me for this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You need to have a chat with Nyx the next time you&#039;re both Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn giggled. &quot;Nope, not spoiling the surprise. Seriously though... Trust me. You&#039;re in the clear for now, okay? We can keep this our little secret for now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis took a moment to compose herself. &quot;I... thank you, Twilight Sparkle. I hope to prove your trust is not misplaced.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sure that you&#039;ll succeed. By the way, you ever do this again and I will let Pinkie <i>have her way with you.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen gulped. &quot;Understood.&quot; The sheer storm of emotions coming from that particular pony had nearly convinced her the world was ending.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.5</p><p class="double">“Okay, that looks good…” Fluttershy whispered, looking the latest attempt over closely. “Can you swivel them?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis crossed her eyes, and the small cat ears which were replacing her normal ones obediently moved first left, then right.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Fluttershy nodded. “Looks like you got the muscles down properly. Now, er… I had an idea for a prank…”</p><p class="double">The Changeling Queen looked at Fluttershy. “Let’s hear it, then.”</p><p class="double">“Well, er…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Be on watch,” Luna reminded her sister. “We have heard that there is an evil abroad in the land.”</p><p class="double">“I am, Luna,” Celestia assured her. “I am ready for anything. Nothing will interfere with this wedding.”</p><p class="double">Luna swung her telescope groundwards. “Who might that be?”</p><p class="double">Celestia stepped up to the railing. “I… don’t know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Ohayo!” came a bright, cheerful voice.</p><p class="double">Cadence looked over. “Who are you?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, gomennasai.” The pony she was addressing looked terribly downcast, and her ears flattened against her head.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait, they did what?</i> Cadence looked closer.</p><p class="double">The pegasus in question had ears that were distinctly… feline.</p><p class="double">“Oh!” As Cadence looked, the ears perked up again. “Oh, ah… can I have your autograph, Cadence-chan?”</p><p class="double">The princess of love blanked. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">That didn’t seem to dissuade the strange pegasus, who thrust a notebook and quill into her hooves. “Please?”</p><p class="double">Numbly, Cadence scribbled down her signature and offered it back to the black-coated pegasus, whose face lit up.</p><p class="double">“Ariagato!” The… cat-pony shot off, practically bouncing along the corridor.</p><p class="double">Cadence turned to Twilight, who was stuffing a hoof into her mouth to avoid laughing. “What just happened, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Slowly and carefully, Twilight took a deep breath. When she was sure of being able to speak without giggling, she began.</p><p class="double">“I think that was probably a Neighponese fangirl,” Twilight explained. “You can tell by the cat ears.”</p><p class="double">From down the corridor came the sound of a fairly successful glomp, and some shouting from Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">“I’ll go sort that out,” Twilight excused herself.</p><p class="double">She supposed that, on balance, it was probably a good sign if Chrysalis was able to do this kind of thing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.6 (Anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle had a list.</p><p class="double">Actually, she had <i>lots</i> of lists, but somewhere between The Official Summer Sun Celebration Overseer&#039;s Checklist (version three, from a loop where Celestia had complicated the usual scenario with a truly inordinate fondness for carrots, heavy metal music, thunderstorms, and clashing color combinations) and The Official List of Things Looping Pinkie Pie Is Not Allowed To Do Volume XXIV, was a list of experiments to run, experiences to seek out, and pranks to play when the loops allowed. Twilight being Twilight, this list was neatly sorted and cross-indexed by the prerequisite fellow Loopers and loop conditions.</p><p class="double">So, when Twilight found herself in a baseline loop with a start point prior to the Sonic Rainboom with Rainbow Dash Awake, she was quickly able to remind herself of what she wanted to try.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle wanted to earn a cutie mark. Specifically, she wanted a different cutie mark. She&#039;d attempted this before, but time and time again had only received her own starbust mark. (She had looped into alternate selves with different marks a few times, but that didn&#039;t count.)This time, though, Twilight had a special <i>sub</i>list of steps to prevent many of the pitfalls she had encountered in past experiments.</p><p class="double">Step One, asking Rainbow Dash to not do a sonic rainboom, was necessary because Twilight had found that, if her many-colored friend performed one close to the appropriate time, no matter what precautions Twilight took, it would trigger a magical surge and her normal cutie mark. This required only a promise to arrange a <i>sextuple </i>sonic rainboom the next time everypony was Awake in a baseline loop early enough in the timeline.</p><p class="double">Step Two was to prevent her parents from applying her for entry to the School For Gifted Unicorns. This loop was early enough, thankfully, that all it would take would be to “lose interest” in the obsessive magical studies her pre-loop self had just begun, and find something non-magical to occupy herself with over the summer. Probably pranking Cadance and Shining Armor, if they weren&#039;t Looping. Seeing them with adult eyes, it was always hilarious how desperate they were to hide their budding relationship from both Twilight and her parents.</p><p class="double">Step Three, enjoy a life as an ordinary unicorn filly (or at least as “ordinary” as one being foalsat by an alicorn princess could be), avoid magic as much as possible, start school in the fall, and see what happened.</p><p class="double">It was a simple plan. Nothing could possibly go wrong.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Upper East Canterlot Elementary was not much like the School For Gifted Unicorns or even that most terrible of tortures, Magic Kindergarten. For one, there were earth ponies and pegasi attending, though they were a minority of the herd of students. For another, Twilight Sparkle was neither the famous personal student of the Princess, nor a bullied outcast who couldn&#039;t control her weak magic.</p><p class="double">It was actually rather refreshing to just be a background face in the crowd, and for the first few months of class Twilight just drifted while pondering what kind of cutie mark to seek out, carefully doing just well enough in classes to be counted as a good student, but not enough to make a name for herself as exceptional. She made many acquaintances but no friends, but also no enemies. There was still a sizable enough mass of students in her year without cutie marks that her own blank flank normally attracted no comments.</p><p class="double">Today was one of the exceptions, but not due to the (sadly for the most part inevitable) bullying that late blank flanks endured. During P.E., Twilight had – quite accidentally – managed to score the winning goal in a game of hoofball, from over halfway across the field. Her own team, half the opposing side, and even the coach, had immediately clustered around her, and the groans of disappointment as they&#039;d found her lavender fur unmarked had been audible.</p><p class="double">While it <i>would</i> have technically met her goals, Twilight Sparkle could not be disappointed that she&#039;d failed to reveal a special destiny of being good at kicking balls into nets. She was certain there were ponies that would find that a happy and fulfilling hobby, but it wasn&#039;t really <i>her</i>. Which was probably why she was still a blank flank, actually. Twilight had been so focused on avoiding anything that even hinted of magic that she&#039;d deliberately avoided doing pretty much anything she loved. She wasn&#039;t going to get a cutie mark that way.</p><p class="double">As she headed home (P.E being the final class of the day for her class section), Twilight was lost in thought. Maybe she should start showing her enjoyment of reading and aim for a librarian cutie mark, she wondered as she turned a corner, or would it be better to try new things and find something she didn&#039;t know she enjoyed yet? Then she stopped dead. Somepony was <i>following</i> her! Why would anypony do that?</p><p class="double">“Come out, whoever you are!” Twilight yelled, glancing up at the trees that lined the narrow cross-street she usually took on her way home.</p><p class="double">Not completely surprisingly, it was one of her classmates who came down to street level in clumsy, hesitant flight.</p><p class="double">“Um... hi?” the orange pegasus colt said awkwardly as he landed in front of Twilight, his wings closing on his sides.</p><p class="double">Twilight glared at him for just a moment. “Flash Sentry, right?” she asked. That had actually been a surprise, that the stallion who frequently became the captain of her guard when she became a Princess had grown up in the same neighborhood as her.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” he said nervously, shifting away a little, like he was about to bolt. Whatever he might become in the future, right now he was still a little blank flank colt that she&#039;d caught stalking her.</p><p class="double">Twilight decided to just raise an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry shifted again before answering the unspoken question. “You ran off so fast after P.E., Twilight. I just... I wanted to let you know I think you&#039;re really -” He stopped suddenly, turned bright red, and started stammering. “I... I... mean I... I wanted to say I thought that <i>kick</i> was really awesome, that&#039;s all!”</p><p class="double">Twilight was only able to hold her stern expression for a moment before she started to giggle. Okay, the stalking was a bit creepy, maybe, but it was almost certainly innocent, and more importantly adorable. Maybe a little harmless schoolyard romance was just the thing to make her push her limits and find something unmagical to...</p><p class="double">That was when somepony rammed into her from behind. Twilight let out a surprised yelp as she stumbled forward into Flash Sentry, sending both of them tumbling over.</p><p class="double">“Excuse me,” the filly behind them said, choking back a sob and pushing past the two young ponies, her eyes fixed on the ground.</p><p class="double">“Hey, wait!” Flash Sentry called out as he stood, disentangling himself from Twilight.</p><p class="double">Twilight rose as well, studying the pink-maned white unicorn, tall for her age, who had stopped dead a yard or so away. It took only a moment to place her as a student in the same year but another class. “Your name is Fleur, right?” she asked. Another pony she remembered from other loops, though only vaguely. She became friends with Rarity sometimes, didn&#039;t she?</p><p class="double">Fleur just nodded, not even turning to face Twilight and Flash.</p><p class="double">“Are you okay?” the pegasus asked worriedly. “It sounded like you were cry-”</p><p class="double">“Shut <i>up!</i>” Fleur interrupted. “What do you care? Leave me alone and go back to flirting with the hoofball star!”</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry took a step back, his wings flapping wildly. “It... it isn&#039;t like that! Twilight, I swear -”</p><p class="double">Twilight ignored him for the moment, walking past him and up to Fleur. “Blue Belle, right?” she asked. Schoolyard politics were not terribly hard for her to sort out, though they actually were more mature than the adult version sometimes.</p><p class="double">For the first time, Fleur turned her head back to look at Twilight. “Yes, all right?” she snapped, while she talked revealing silver braces on her teeth. “She called me an ugly, clumsy blank flank who can&#039;t trot five steps without tripping over her own four hooves, and I want to go off and cry about it like the crybaby I am, so just <i>go away</i>.”</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry looked angry, and Twilight decided to say something to derail the train of thought the was almost certainly going through his mind before he said or did something stupid. “We&#039;re all blank flanks,” Twilight said quietly, slowly stepping closer to the other filly, “and...” she trailed off, then with an exaggerated glance back at Flash pressed against Fleur and whispered in her ear, “if my brother&#039;s magazines are any sign, in a few years the colts will find long legs <i>very </i>attractive.”</p><p class="double">Fleur blushed, the scarlet flush easily visible through pale fur. “Shut up,” she said, though far less harshly, though she still stepped away. “That&#039;s gross.”</p><p class="double">Flash Sentry looked confused. “What did you say, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled, and after a moment Fleur joined her. Twilight offered a hoof. “I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle,” she introduced herself.</p><p class="double">Fleur gingerly touched hooves, giving a weak shake. “Fleur Dis Lee,” she said.</p><p class="double">Not to be left out, the lone colt offered, “Flash Sentry.”</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced at her two companions, a thought occurring. Well, for the parallel to be exact she&#039;d have to turn Flash into a filly and Fleur into an earth pony, but those were minor details. A wicked grin appeared on her face. “I have an idea...”</p><p class="double">Fleur looked nervous. “What?”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re all blank flanks, aren&#039;t we?” Twilight asked, and started to explain. As she did, Fleur&#039;s eyes widened and Flash started to grin. “...and we could form our own secret society!” Twilight finished excitedly.</p><p class="double">“It needs a name, though,” Fleur observed, her distress apparently forgotten in the wake of Twilight&#039;s proposal.</p><p class="double">“Triple Cutie Threat!” Flash Sentry proposed.</p><p class="double">The two fillies shared a look and a giggle, then Twilight smiled. Trademarks didn&#039;t persist between loops, so she might as well go all the way. “The Cutie Mark Crusaders.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When the three young ponies knocked on the door of Twilight&#039;s home a couple hours later, Twilight&#039;s mom gave them one look, then sent them around back to rinse off with the garden hose before coming inside.</p><p class="double">“That kind of tree isn&#039;t even supposed to <i>have</i> this much sap,” Twilight said sourly as she pretended to struggle with her magic to loosen the stuck valve and turn the water on.</p><p class="double">“And we&#039;re banned from <i>every</i> bowling alley in Canterlot!” Fleur wailed. “It&#039;s terrible.”</p><p class="double">“Let me get it,” Flash said, reaching for the valve. Twilight let him have it. “It was a lot of fun, though,” he said, grunting as the stubborn metal refused to budge.</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Fleur said softly. “It was. I... I really liked it. Thank you.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “What are friends for?” she offered.</p><p class="double">“Are we friends?” Fleur asked.</p><p class="double">Flash glanced at her. “Of course we are,” he said, sounding confused that it was even a question. Twilight just grinned and nodded.</p><p class="double">Fleur was still a moment, then suddenly engulfed the other two in a hug.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Flash protested, struggling a little to get free.</p><p class="double">Twilight just returned the hug, smiling. Even if the experiment failed – again – this loop would be worth it just for the chance to make new friends.</p><p class="double">There was a familiar tingling on her side, and Fleur gasped suddenly.</p><p class="double">“Wow, Twilight,” Flash said. “You&#039;re really good at this whole earning cutie marks thing!”</p><p class="double">Twilight started to wrestle herself free. “What is it?” she demanded, and when she finally could she twisted her head around to see for herself.</p><p class="double">A familiar starbust stared back at her, and Twilight froze. How? She hadn&#039;t been doing anything even remotely magical... <i>oh</i>. “Ponyfeathers,” she swore, drawing a scandalized gasp from Fleur and a puzzled look from Flash.</p><p class="double">Ignoring the two for a moment, Twilight planted her hoof in her face. It was something she, of all ponies, should never have forgotten to take into account.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s wrong with it, Twilight?” Flash asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned before answering, not that he was likely to understand. “Friendship <i>is </i>magic.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.7</p><p class="double">“Right.” Applejack looked across the kitchen counter. “Ready?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Pinkie chirped.</p><p class="double">They both looked down at the ingredients strewn all over the kitchen. Apples, flour, milk, apples, sugar, apples, a little chocolate, apples, apples, yeast, apples, eggs, butter, cinnamon and apples.</p><p class="double">“We’re gonna get this whole buffalo business sorted out once and for all,” Applejack said grimly. “Now… go!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie grabbed a whisk and poured the flour, some of the sugar, the eggs and some butter into the bowl. “Working on the pastry, cap’n!”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha,” Applejack replied, picking up a knife and getting to work on the apples, the apples and the apples. “Pass me that cinnamon, would’ya?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Pinkie spun her head as she worked, which flipped the cinnamon into the air. It bounced off the ceiling, the lid came off, and just enough cinnamon to flavour the apples spilled onto them before it hit the workbench and the lid landed right back on top of it again.</p><p class="double">Applejack blinked. “Okay, how’d y’all do that?” she mumbled around the knife handle.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged, still enthusiastically mixing.</p><p class="double">“Eh, whatever.” After a suspicious look, Applejack got back to the apples.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Slowly and reverently, Pinkie withdrew the baking tray from the oven.</p><p class="double">Resting on it were six Apple-Pie Apple Pies.</p><p class="double">With a series of <i>thuds</i>, two of the Crusaders and Winona crashed into the side of the house.</p><p class="double">“Guess you like the smell, do ya?” Applejack said, leaning out the window. “Hey, where’s Scootaloo?”</p><p class="double">“Dunno,” Sweetie replied, standing still and sniffing at the delicious aromas coming out of the window.</p><p class="double">Then there was the sound of a crash on the roof.</p><p class="double">“I’m okay!” Scootaloo shouted. “But my hang glider isn’t… wow, that smells <i>good</i>.”</p><p class="double">“They ain’t for you,” Applejack said sternly. “Maybe the next batch, but not this one. These are gonna head off a war.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So.” The buffalo chief stared across a table at his opposite number. “You wish to bargain with us?”</p><p class="double">“We do,” Silver Star answered. “We would prefer peace to war.”</p><p class="double">“You think you are the only ones?” Thunderhooves shrugged. “But no matter. Posturing will not bring peace.”</p><p class="double">Applejack sidled up to the table. “Ah think it might calm tempers if y’all had some food while you’re negotiatin’.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good,” Silver Star said. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Apple Pie.” Applejack trotted over to a cart and took two covered dishes from it. Putting them in front of the dignitaries, she swept the covers off in one motion.</p><p class="double">Then she noticed Pinkie had got out a banjo, and tackled her before she ruined everything.</p><p class="double">“This… smells good,” Thunderhooves said slowly, looking down at the Apple Pie.</p><p class="double">Then, as though on an invisible signal, both he and Silver Star dove into their Pies.</p><p class="double">Thirty seconds later, they were done.</p><p class="double">“That was <i>very</i> good,” the sheriff said, licking his lips. “Er… are there any more?”</p><p class="double">Applejack and Pinkie exchanged glances. Then looked around at the large, curious herds of buffalo and ponies.</p><p class="double">“We may have made a teensy amount too few…” Pinkie suggested. “I suggest we run.”</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded solemnly. Then both of them broke into a gallop, headed for the train line.</p><p class="double">“Well, on the bright side, at least they’re not fighting any more!” Pinkie said chirpily.</p><p class="double">“Yay,” Applejack deadpanned. “Next time, we make as many of ‘em as we can fit in a train!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.8</p><p class="double">“I can’t believe this,” Rarity said, shaking her head.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Spike replied, blinking. “<i>This</i> is becoming a big deal?”</p><p class="double">“Of course it is!” Rarity frowned. “This is a very important… issue…”</p><p class="double">She trailed off.</p><p class="double">“On balance, the fact that you keep eating the spoons isn’t all that major,” she allowed. “But I don’t like your blithe dismissal of my concerns.”</p><p class="double">“So… I’m right, but you don’t like how I was right?” Spike checked.</p><p class="double">“Not quite. You should give my opinions the weight they deserve.”</p><p class="double">“Again, what I was saying, but casting me in a more negative light. That’s got <i>me</i> annoyed now.” Spike tapped a claw on the floor. “Okay, look. We’re just going to keep finding excuses to snarl at one another if we don’t work this off. I suggest the Frozen North. Two hours, full battle rattle, first one unconscious has to wash up.”</p><p class="double">Rarity looked over at her sink, despite herself. “There’s nothing <i>to</i> wash up.”</p><p class="double">“Which is why I’m going to let Pinkie Pie make a making up cake in here,” Spike replied with an evil grin.</p><p class="double">“You wouldn’t!” Rarity gasped.</p><p class="double">Spike waved a paw. “On reflection… I think I would, actually.”</p><p class="double">“Spike, if you <i>dare-”</i></p><p class="double">“Well, you’d better beat me, then, hadn’t you?” he challenged. “I mean, if you do, then the net result is cake.”</p><p class="double">Rarity scowled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why am I involved in this?” Twilight asked, seemingly to herself.</p><p class="double">“In case we are both knocked out and need to be transported back to Ponyville,” Spike replied, now about fifty feet long.</p><p class="double">“And so that you can bear witness that I’ve won,” Rarity added. She had her wings out, and was wearing something made out of woven diamond and magic, which still bore the faint proof-scarring from when she’d tested it.</p><p class="double">By jumping between Chrysalis and Celestia’s beam war at the Canterlot Wedding.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight rolled her eyes. “Seriously, can’t you two have <i>normal</i> couples’ spats?”</p><p class="double">“No,” the other two replied in unison.</p><p class="double">“Right. Okay, the rules are, nothing fatal. Though given what you two are like, I didn’t need to tell you anyway… go!”</p><p class="double">Twilight slammed up a bunker shield, and watched the fireworks.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oooh…” the population of Manehattan breathed, watching some particularly energetic northern lights.</p><p class="double">“Aaaahhh…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna opened the door to her bedroom, ready for a well-earned day’s rest.</p><p class="double">Then she paused.</p><p class="double">“Sister? Didst thou install a dragon in mine room when I was not looking?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight…” Celestia said, her voice slightly strained, “Why is Spike asleep in my sister’s bedroom? For that matter, why is he fifty feet long and covered in scorch marks?”</p><p class="double">Behind them, Luna poked at the slumbering dragon with the butt of a guard’s spear. Occasionally, she muttered something under her breath.</p><p class="double">“It’s a long story,” Twilight said weakly. “Luna’s bedroom was the best place I could find for them to sleep it off.”</p><p class="double">“Them?”</p><p class="double">“Aha!” Luna said, with an air of triumph in her voice. “I have found another interloper!” Then her tone changed. “I was aware of Cadence, but her cutie mark is not much like the one you vouchsafed to me. That is a diamond repeated three times, not the Crystal Heart…”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Okay, I’ll start from the beginning. Can you send for cocoa? This could take a while.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Barely-within-rating omake (Stainless Steel Fox):</p><p class="double"><u>Omake</u></p><p class="double">Rarity stirred, and snuggled against Spike&#039;s neck. &quot;Ohhh Spike! You&#039;re so strong and tough. I love the way your scales shine like diamonds when you swoop...&quot;</p><p class="double">The big dragon rumbled happily, shrinking down a couple of age categories until he was Big Mac sized. &quot;I have the most beautiful and most amazing filly in the world as a girlfriend. Have I told you how incredibly sexy you are when you&#039;re angry?</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Spike!&quot; &quot;Oh Rarity!&quot; &quot;Oh brother!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pair suddenly realised they weren&#039;t alone and stopped what looked to be the start of an epic makeout session.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot; Rarity looked up, and noticed the purple unicorn standing there, and behind her, Princess Luna and Celestia. &quot;Eep!&quot;</p><p class="double">She hauled up the bedsheets around herself, noticing for the first time that they had Luna&#039;s cutie-mark. &quot;This isn&#039;t what it looks like!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually it sort of is...&quot; admitted Spike.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.9 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Pinkness</b></p><p class="double">Applejack took a deep breath and ran a hand through his short-cut hair. There were at least two things wrong with that sentence in his opinion, but the universe seemed to care even less than usual. &quot;Alright, let&#039;s review. Twilight, yer… what exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">The rather short girl adjusted her glasses. &quot;A humanoid interface for the Integrated Data Thought Entity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s local memories offered a literary reference she didn&#039;t recognize. That seemed to be a habit this Loop. &quot;Right, an&#039; that is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Basically, imagine the end result of a Loop if Apple Bloom were the Anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">After pondering this for a moment, Applejack asked, &quot;So mah baby sister&#039;s gonna invent magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. &quot;Well, it&#039;s not magic so much as manipulating the metadata of existence through—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, magic.&quot; Applejack turned to the other boy in the group. &quot;Rarity, yer—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Elusive in this context, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">It just wasn&#039;t fair, Applejack thought. Even when they were both stallions, Rarity was still prettier. &quot;Right. <i>Elusive</i>, yer still sort of a unicorn?&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a nod. &quot;Yes, but my magic only works in certain locations. &#039;Closed spaces,&#039; as they&#039;re called.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; we ain&#039;t in one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Elusive&#039;s mild grin shifted to utmost seriousness. &quot;Believe me, Applejack, if we were in a closed space, you&#039;d know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, right. Good to know.&quot; Applejack shifted focus to Fluttershy. He wasn&#039;t afraid. It just seemed prudent. If there was an element of haste, it was simply to get this review over with all the faster. &quot;Now, Shy, yer a time traveller?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. &quot;From classified information years in the… oh.&quot; She blushed. &quot;Sorry. This is a very powerful mental block. I&#039;d have to Ascend to bypass it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The idea was tempting, but Applejack shook his head. &quot;Let&#039;s save that &#039;til we really need it.&quot; He moved to the last person in the room. &quot;Rainbow, yer a mob boss&#039;s daughter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apparently.&quot; Dash grinned, revealing rather prominent canines. &quot;Whoever I am doesn&#039;t normally hang out with you guys, but that&#039;s not gonna stop me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t have it any other way, sugarcube.&quot; Applejack frowned. &quot;And meanwhile, here Ah am, not so much as a scrap of magic t&#039; mah name.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a puzzled frown. &quot;What are you talking about? You can still earthbend, access your dimensional pocket, Ascend—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Far as mah memories go, Ah mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; The interface had the decency to blush. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And then there&#039;s Pinkie Pie,&quot; noted Elusive.</p><p class="double">The door to the club room slammed open. Speak of the Nightmare, thought Applejack, and she will appear.</p><p class="double">Hand on her hips and smile on her face, Paizumiya Pinkuhi stood proudly in the doorway. &quot;Hello, SOS-Dan! Are you ready to find the impossible?&quot;</p><p class="double">The five humans stared at their friend, knowing that the question was entirely rhetorical. No matter what they said, she&#039;d browbeat them into helping her saving the world by overloading it with fun. Even if she couldn&#039;t do it directly, subconscious reality distortion would make it so.</p><p class="double">Twilight broadcast a message to the other Awakened members of the brigade through something distinct from telepathy in ways only she cared about. <i>I can honestly say I have never been more terrified in my entire existence.</i> The others could only nod.</p><p class="double">Pinkuhi took this as assent. &quot;Great! Hope you&#039;re all ready, &#039;cause I&#039;ve got a big, big itinerary planned. Kyon, you&#039;re paying.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed.

Ancient proto-Equestrian alternate history was never my strong suit in school. What was I supposed to think? Besides, even without going all ascendant alicorn on his flank, we&#039;re all more than a match for that Tirak by ourselves. Look at me! I was awesome before, but now I&#039;m so fast I can rip holes into other dimensions. You have even more affinity for jewels and stuff than you used to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s galled gemomancy; and yes, as Sparkler, I find that I can control them to a much higher degree,&quot; Sparkler said as she casually ripped out a sizable emerald shard out of the earth and sent it streaking into and through a nearby oak tree. &quot;That still doesn&#039;t excuse what you did.&quot;</p><p class="double">Firefly swallowed heavily, &quot;Come on! Look at what Pinkie Pie has become. She&#039;s up there flapping around as Surprise and shouting something about legendary super saiyans. Applejack may look the same, but she seems even stronger than she was before.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack tried to walk over to Firefly, but instead stumbled into a nearby sizable tree - knocking it down. </p><p class="double">&quot;Why the hay am I so clumsy in this form?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie in the form of Surprise was suddenly there, giggling and pointing towards the orange pony, &quot;Because you are a silly pony, Applejack. A very silly pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack snorted in annoyance, &quot;That&#039;s not even a real answer.&quot;</p><p class="double">Firefly/Dash continued, &quot;Posey is an earth pony, so she&#039;s even more in tune with all those forest critters than Fluttershy was, no matter how impossible that seems. And Twilight. Twilight&#039;s special talent is now being a bucking reality warper only a few levels below Discord. Once she pulls herself together, she&#039;ll have infinite wishes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sparkler looked over at the unicorn, who was lying on her side in a miserable ball, &quot;What is wrong with her?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight wailed in answer, &quot;I look just like my mother!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Technically if this world does evolve into the Equestria we know, you are probably your own great, great, great, great, etcetera grandmother!&quot; Surprise stated happily as she flew off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, right,&quot; Firefly said, &quot;So extra dimensional saviour or not, it doesn&#039;t matter. Besides, what would a pony like Firefly think? She punches a hole into another dimension looking for a saviour. The world is in peril. Time is critical. Who was she going to choose? A strange monkey-ape thing that she&#039;s never seen before, or this strong stallion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He is just a common human-world horse. He&#039;s not even sentient!&quot; Sparkler pointed to the brown equine. Said &#039;hero&#039; was currently grazing happily. &quot;How did you even carry him here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It wasn&#039;t easy. Whatever. Look, I&#039;m going to go punch a hole into an unpleasant dimension and toss that stupid looking centaurian abomination into it. I mean really? Darkness that lasts forever? Been there, done that, kicked it&#039;s flank. Come join the party if you want.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, oh! Me! I want to join the party!&quot; Surprise shouted as she flew after Firefly, followed by a smiling Posey/Fluttershy as she rode on the back of an armoured bear who was at the head of an entire waddling contingent of honey badger cavalry. </p><p class="double">Applejack gathered up Twilight and together they stumbled towards what would probably be the very brief and very final confrontation with Tirak.</p><p class="double">Sparkler watched them leave, briefly contemplating how her pale blue coat made her even more of a winter. As she started off after her friends, she gave one last look at the oblivious human world stallion, &quot;Ugh. You better not be the reason for how the Saddle Arabians developed.&quot;</p><p class="double">TJ, the brown horse idly flicked his ear at the odd pony before continuing to ignore everything that wasn&#039;t grass or a threat.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile on her family farm in the human dimension, Megan stood around in a daze. Earlier, a wondrous rainbow-looking rift opened up and a magical talking pegasus pony flew in, said she needed someone to help save her world from a monster; and before Megan could volunteer in what would surely be as grand and exciting an adventure as any teenage girl could dream of, the pegasus grabbed TJ, her horse, and flew off. </p><p class="double">&quot;Sis, what are you doing here? You&#039;ve been out here for hours. Where&#039;s TJ?&quot; Her sister, Molly, asked as she came near.</p><p class="double">Megan slowly turned her head towards her sister, &quot;I don&#039;t want to talk about it. Not ever.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.11</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The pegasus looked around. “Okay, where the hell am I now? Donald, was this your doing?”</p><p class="double">A unicorn trotted unsteadily over. “Wasn’t me,” he said, with a slight rasp to his voice. “I thought it was your clothes.”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” The pegasus shrugged. “How are you doing with walking?”</p><p class="double">“It ain’t easy.” Donald tripped and nearly faceplanted. “At least you’ve got wings, Sora. And experience at being four legged!”</p><p class="double">“Hey, that’s a point.” Sora spread them, and flailed at the air until he was aloft. “I’ll go look for Goofy.”</p><p class="double">“Sure, whatever…” Donald sat back, trying to work out how his magic had changed. And, for that matter, how to hold his staff.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Huh, new Loopers,” Twilight said, as Dash finished describing them. “Well, I don’t recognize them from the description. One of each type?”</p><p class="double">“Yep, same as usual.” Dash nodded. “Strange thing is, only the pegasus is finding, well, walking easy. And even he moves more like Gilda.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Twilight nodded. “Huh. Interesting. Well, I’d better go and meet them. Go let Princess Luna know, I think she’s Awake.”</p><p class="double">“Aye aye, Twi!” Dash saluted, and vanished in a <i>crack</i> of displaced air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, right…” Sora said, looking up. “So this is where <i>you</i> came from.”</p><p class="double">“It is indeed,” Luna replied. “You would be Sora, yes?”</p><p class="double">“That’s right.” The pegasus crossed his eyes, and a keyblade flashed into being between his teeth. “<i>There</i> we go, I’ve been trying to get that to work all morning…” he added in a mumble.</p><p class="double">“You know him?” Twilight asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“I Replaced one of the people from his Loop once,” Luna explained. “That was the same Loop wherein little Nyx did my job.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, yes, the sideways moon incident,” Twilight said, nodding. “Yes, you did tell me about that place. Keys, wasn’t it?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much.” Sora concentrated, and the keyblade flashed between a dozen different forms. “I’ve got a <i>lot</i> of choice by now. Anyway, what’s your world like?”</p><p class="double">“Mostly peaceful, actually…” Twilight said, shrugging. “We can handle most of the villains who show up just fine. Though, actually…” she trailed off, a grin spreading across her face.</p><p class="double">“What?” Luna asked, seeing it.</p><p class="double">“I was wondering how Sombra would react to being hit by a Keyblade.” Twilight shrugged. “Should be interesting.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.12 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vice principal Luna had called Twilight in and showed her the pictures of her wrecking the Fall Formal. However, this time she wasn&#039;t going to stand there and let the Vice principal steamroller right over her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Vice Principal Luna. I can state absolutely that these things never happened, and that these photos are as fake as something very fake. I can account for my movements the whole day, and most of the time I was even in the company of Pinkie Pie, the planner in charge of the Fall Formal. If I had wrecked it, she&#039;d be the last po-person to give me an alibi. I assume the motivation you felt applied was that I tried to delay it to buy more time to win my bid to be Princess of the Fall Formal from Sunset Shimmer? If so then you are out of date. My friends and I have already done an end run around her and her friends Snips and Snails. If you took the votes right now, it would be Sunset Shimmer who would lose. You can check all this for yourself.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Vice-principal looked at her sternly, but the teenager just stood there calmly, not defensive, just without a doubt.</p><p class="double">&quot;So how do <i>you</i> account for these photos?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took on a thoughtful attitude. &quot;Well, there are three parts to it, method, means and motivation. Method and means are intertwined. The background is real, and so are the images of me, but the whole is not, so somehow, someone got photos of me doing something energetic, like the game of football I had with Rainbow Dash, and added my image over the real culprit. I can think of several ways, either using the school computer and image editing software, or just cutting out a physical photo and running the altered image through a colour photocopier. So I&#039;d ask my friends if they saw anyone taking photos of my game with Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;As to motivation... Who would benefit most from destroying my credibility as a Fall Formal Princess entrant, and delaying the event to give themselves time to regain control of the vote? Someone who&#039;s already used sneaky tactics and disinformation to character assassinate me? If it was the same person who brought you those photos, I&#039;d definitely find them suspect. Out of interest, who is my accuser?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunset Shinmmer.&quot; Principal Luna&#039;s experession hardened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe you should ask her how she got those photos, and why the person taking them didn&#039;t try to stop me instead of just collecting evidence.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the door. Flash Sentry came in and gave her the doctored photos.</p><p class="double">&quot;Vice Principal Luna. I found these in a trash can in the library. Thought you should see them. Someone obviously combined these photos to make it <i>look</i> like Twilight was the one who trashed the gym.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see. Well that is a point for your theory. Of course it also seems convenient that that evidence came to light...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;A double bluff? Setting this up myself to make Sunset Shimmer look like the culprit? I did spend some time in the library, but my alibi still stands, and as I said, my friends did an amazing job of getting people on my side. I don&#039;t need complicated ploys or to take her out of the running. Simple honesty and bringing people together is a far better strategy than trying to cheat and con my way in. Like I said, take the vote right now, you&#039;ll see the truth. I suspect if you check the movements of Snips and Snails, Sunset Shimmer doesn&#039;t seem to be the sort to do her own dirty work, you will also see what&#039;s going on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vice-principal Luna nodded. &quot;Very well. I am afraid enough damage has been done to the gym that we will have to postpone the dance until tomorrow night. If you will excuse me, I need to let my sister know about this latest development. And to ask some questions of Sunset Shimmer.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;I will talk to Pinkie and see if we can get things together sooner than that. After all, I ran for Princess on a platform of helping out and coming together as a school, maybe I can get some people to follow up on that and help out.&quot;</p><p class="double">As they left she turned to Flash Sentry. &quot;Thank you! You have no idea how important this is to me&quot;</p><p class="double">He chuckled. &quot;What was I gonna do? Not prove your innocence? Wouldn&#039;t be much of a Canterlot Wondercolt, would I? So, uh, I was wondering. If you aren&#039;t already going with somebody, wanna go to the Fall Formal with me tomorrow night?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight had no intention of hurting his feelings, even accidentally this time round. &quot;It will be tonight, and yes, I would love to be your date.&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to face him, hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. &quot;If you have some free time, anybody you can round up to help fix the decorations would be good.&quot;</p><p class="double">She had to giggle at the complete experssion of brain-lock this resulted in. &quot;I&#039;ll see you later...&quot;</p><p class="double">As she turned around the end of the hall, she heard a &quot;YESS!&quot; and allowed herself another grin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">29.13</p><p class="double">“G4,” Shining Armor said, playing a card on the table.</p><p class="double">“Snap,” Discord replied, playing his own. “And that brings my score to a multiple of seven.”</p><p class="double">“One hundred and eighteen isn’t a multiple of seven…” Shining said uncertainly.</p><p class="double">Discord pointed to one of the other cards in play. “Bad mathematics. Lets me adjust the result or input of a calculation up or down by one.”</p><p class="double">Cadence flipped back and forth through the rulebook. “So that means…”</p><p class="double">Discord shifted a counter. “I put my own joker in check, and switch allegiances from Prance to the letter Q.”</p><p class="double">Celestia slammed a card down on the table. “Contingency card! I get the yellow marble.”</p><p class="double">“Then you have a beard,” Luna pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Drat, I do. That makes me vulnerable to the Queensburg Defence.” Celestia examined the table. “Baker Street.”</p><p class="double">“East Ham,” Luna replied.</p><p class="double">“Mornington Crescent!” Cadence collected four cards from the others around the table, then played two of them. “I change history so that the horse collar was never invented, and that triggers a cascade which leads to me getting four extra Lands and a brand of cheese.”</p><p class="double">“Drat,” Celestia said absently. “So much for my gambit. Luna, your turn.”</p><p class="double">“I’m cashing in my lands for an army,” Luna said, shuffling them into the deck. “That lets me take two of Discord’s lands and summon the Moon. Four turns until impact!”</p><p class="double">Cadence helpfully moved the moon counter to the number four.</p><p class="double">“Thank you. And now I’m going to purchase a manor at Trottingham, which puts me on a double word score.”</p><p class="double">After looking at the result of that for a moment, Cadence drew a card. “Yes, it’s my special! Crystal Heart, my holdings are immune to damage for the foreseeable future and so I trade across all my other defences for political power and waffles. Then I loot the room, which gives me treasure. Your turn, Shiny.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor stared at his hand, then at the board. “I have no idea what is going on.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>30.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><u>More Turning the Tables (at long last)</u></p><p class="double">“Careful with that cabinet!” Prince Blueblood called out. “It&#039;s Chippendale!”</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t know they went into furniture making after their detective career...” Pinkie Pie mused.</p><p class="double">The size of the party would push the carrying capacity of Blueblood&#039;s yacht to its limit, so all non-essential equipment was being off loaded under the eyes and fussy attitude of the Prince. Inside the Town hall, Shining Armour passed a scroll to one of the pegasus guards and said, “Concorde, take this to Princess Cadence with all speed!”</p><p class="double">“Yes sir!” The pegasus saluted and trotted out, flexing his wings.</p><p class="double">Shining Armour turned to Twilight and asked, “Okay, so why have I just sent a message that may end up creating another evil alicorn?”</p><p class="double">“The notes I included should explain how Cadence could use her love magic to &#039;burn out&#039; the taint of evil that the Alicorn Amulet casts on its wearer. Of course she doesn&#039;t have the theoretical background to understand them herself, unless she took a night school course I didn&#039;t hear about, but Spell Nexus or one of the senior lecturers at the school can help her put it into practice.</p><p class="double">“At the moment it&#039;s only a theory, but even so, the Amulet doesn&#039;t turn you evil instantly. From my research it&#039;s insidious, slowly twisting your perceptions, but that means that it&#039;ll take a long time to affect some-pony as good and decent as Cadence. As long as she only puts it on when she confronts Nightmare Moon, and takes it off as soon as possible, she should be fine.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t like the &#039;should&#039;.” Shining grimaced. “How did you come to be figuring out something like that anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Research!” Twilight grinned triumphantly. “I came across it while I was studying artificing techniques. Obviously, I wondered how you could get the power boost without the mental problems, and thought of Cadence&#039;s power. Admittedly the whole thing is a &#039;Hail Celestia&#039; play, but an alicorn with the amulet&#039;s power boost is about the only other thing I can think of that could stand up to Nightmare Moon. You remember what Von Clawswitz, the griffon general once said?”</p><p class="double">“&#039;Better a dozen unneeded plans than one unmade one.&#039;” Shining quoted. “Let&#039;s just hope it isn&#039;t needed.”</p><p class="double">He hadn&#039;t realised Twilight had retained so much of the studying she&#039;d done while helping him to prepare for his commission exam. But then, his little sister had been surprising him ever since they&#039;d met up again. He knew she was smart, not to mention powerful, but despite the breakdown she&#039;d had, now she was demonstrating a confidence and ability he&#039;d never seen before. These friends of hers must really be something.</p><p class="double">“Okay, we&#039;re ready to go, guys!” Rainbow Dash appeared at the doorway. They emerged from the town hall and out from under the day-light bubble to find the final preparations for their journey had been made.</p><p class="double">The &#039;Blueblood&#039;, named for the owner&#039;s grandfather, was a typical luxury air-racer. A sleek single deck hull, a dozen pony-lengths from bow to stern and a quarter that in the beam, it lacked the size of a full yacht like that of Fancy Pants. However its rakish lines and white and gold trim as well as the twin sets of powerful wing-sails at the stern screamed both style and speed, or would have done if it hadn&#039;t been far too sophisticated to do anything as gauche as scream.</p><p class="double">The envelope above was three times the size of the gondola, and decorated as a gold dragon with its wings raised in mid-flight. It was filled with lift-gas from reserves stored in the keel, and its interior surface had heating spells that could be activated to increase lift. Magic also powered the heating and cooling charms that drove the closed cycle steam engine under the stern. While more expensive than a regular coal fired boiler, it was far lighter and didn&#039;t require a stoker, both important factors on a small air-ship.</p><p class="double">Blueblood was already at the controls, dressed in a natty billed cap and yachting blazer. The rear part of the open deck lacked a true poop deck, but it was raised a few hoofs from the sweep of the main part, with a chest high combing protecting the wheel. The other ponies trooped aboard, several having to go down into the long cabin that took up the balance of the interior that wasn&#039;t occupied by the engines and lift-gas reserves.</p><p class="double">Big Mac was one of them, as the lower down his heavier wood body was the better it would be. Fluttershy had gone with him, her normal timidity around ponies apparently lessened by the fact that he had the appearance of a giant arborean predator who could rip her to pieces with a single claw swipe (Fluttershy had issues). Applejack was also down below with her brother, and a saddlebag full of apples and other supplies.</p><p class="double">Rarity was on deck, and dressed in her own yachting costume. She&#039;d apparently had one made for a long time, and she was going to wear it for all it was worth while she had the chance. Pinkie Pie was bouncing around on deck too, zipping back and forth to examine everything, while Rainbow Dash wasn&#039;t even on deck but above it, ready to fly escort and looking impatiently at the last two ponies to board.</p><p class="double">The gang-plank retracted as they stepped on deck, and Blueblood manipulated levers and hoof pedals. The wing-sails at the back began to flap in a complicated mechanical pattern, and the dirigible started to rise, very slowly, and move forwards at an equally arthritic pace. Rainbow Dash had started to fly off, and zoomed back when it didn&#039;t follow her.</p><p class="double">“C&#039;mon Blueblood, get the hail out! I thought you said that heap was fast!”</p><p class="double">Blueblood stared up at the annoyed pegasus, matching her expression. “It is, and I&#039;ll thank you not to call the Blueblood a &#039;heap&#039;! However, I normally don&#039;t have this many passengers. It&#039;s taking maximum heat to the gas-bag and additional thrust from the wing-sails to get us to rise at all, let alone make headway! And without some air speed, I can&#039;t angle the dragon wings to provide extra lift. We&#039;re too heavy!”</p><p class="double">“I knew I shouldn&#039;t have had that extra slice of cake!” Rarity bemoaned. “Tell me Twilight, has it gone to my flanks?”</p><p class="double">“You look fine to me.” Twilight replied. “But we shouldn&#039;t be that over-loaded... Well, I guess we&#039;ll just have to give it some extra omph!”</p><p class="double">“Oooh! Pinkie exclaimed, “I&#039;ve never had had oomph before! What flavour is it?”</p><p class="double">“Magic flavour!” Twilight grinned, and brought her horn down to touch the decking. A series of lines spread out from the tip, glowing as they etched a pattern into the wood.</p><p class="double">“Careful!” Blueblood cried out. “That deck is made of Zebrican teak!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure we can sand it out.” Twilight replied without taking eyes or horn from the deck where an intricate ritual diagram had been burnt, with a triangle as the central figure. “If you still want to after you see what it does. Shiny, Rarity, could you stand at the other two points of the triangle?”</p><p class="double">“Okay, Twily.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, dear... this won&#039;t hurt will it?”</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped onto the final point of the triangle and her horn started to glow as she looked between the other two unicorns. “Not a bit, it shouldn&#039;t even prove tiring... can you feel my magic?”</p><p class="double">“If you mean that fizzy, tingly sensation under my hooves, then yes!” Rarity looked surprised. “Yes, I can!”</p><p class="double">“Try to match it, you too big brother!” The three unicorn horns started to glow, and the diagram lit up in sympathy, glowing lines that mixed the colours of the three horns. Blueblood saw every dial on his control panel slam over to the maximum peg, and the Blueblood seemed to leap forward under his hooves. Suddenly she was as fleet and nimble as she ever had been or even more so. His air-speed gauge showed she was doing twenty percent over her maximum.</p><p class="double">“Woo hoo! Now that&#039;s more like it!” cheered Dash.</p><p class="double">“Careful! I&#039;m not sure the envelope can take it!” The dragon shell that decorated the gas bag was also a framework that added support, while the wings gave lift, making it more than a simple blimp, but Blueblood knew they weren&#039;t designed for this speed.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay, I&#039;m diverting some of the power into a structural integrity spell.” Twilight called back. “Or rather the rune-set is.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie was already at the bow, standing on her hind legs with her fore-hooves outstretched. “Hey! I&#039;m Princess of the world! Whee! Except for Celestia, and Cadence, and I guess Luna...”</p><p class="double">“Goodness, I hardly feel as if I&#039;m putting any effort in.” Rarity said.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s the triune. The total power is far greater than the sum of its parts... rather like friendship.” Twilight wasn&#039;t exactly lying. However, this was the perfect way to disguise the fact that she was putting in far more power than the other two. She could easily have carried the whole air-ship at even greater speeds if she tapped her full alicorn powers, and she really wanted to get this done.</p><p class="double">They&#039;d made a good start; they&#039;d already gone out over the Everfree and covered an hour&#039;s walk in a few minutes. Twilight could even see that they were not far from the clearing where Zecora lived. A flock of birds rose from the trees below, startled by the passing air-ship... No, not startled, as they swarmed up around it, black raptor looking things with glowing green slit-pupil eyes...</p><p class="double">Dash dived on the cluster coming up on one side and tried to scare them off, but they ignored her, other than trying to catch her with their talons and sharp edged wing tips.</p><p class="double">“Oh you want to do this the hard way? Fine!” Dash weaved and ducked the smaller creatures and lashed at one with a cloud-busting hoof. It connected, and the &#039;bird&#039; poofed into black smoke.</p><p class="double">“Eeek! Black Snooty!” Pinkie squeaked, but quickly recovered and pulled a long handled net from somewhere, sweeping it about to catch the birds.</p><p class="double">“All hooves on deck!” Blueblood called out, reaching up and setting his billed cap at a rakish angle. “Prepare to repel boarders!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy and the Apple family members came storming up, crowding the deck, and both Applejack and Big Mac took a side, Applejack bucking out apples with pin-point precision and knocking the birds back, while Big Mac just demolished them with wide swipes of his claws.</p><p class="double">“Please! Stop this, you don&#039;t want to get hurt...” Fluttershy tried to reach out to the birds, and recoiled with a whimper as she seemed to make contact with them. “They&#039;re not animals! They&#039;re... horrible!”</p><p class="double">“Oh you did <i>not</i> pull that kinda horse-apples with Fluttershy!” Dash growled and flew over the top of the balloon to swoop down on the offending birds. However, it was clear that the gondola wasn&#039;t their main target. Bird after bird swept past the envelope, cruel claws and razor wings slicing at the fabric, creating rent after rent. The cuts healed as they were sealed back together with bursts of purple magic, but it couldn&#039;t quite keep up with the damage.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m loosing lift!” Blueblood yelled, “I&#039;m trying to compensate by feeding in more lift-gas, but my reserves are almost gone! Do something!”</p><p class="double">The Blueblood started to sink and slow down despite the best efforts of the unicorns to support it. Dash and the others did their best to disperse the birds, but there were just too many of them. Twilight was once again trapped by her assumed role, but there were still things she could do. “Every-pony close your eyes!”</p><p class="double">Seeing they had, Twilight&#039;s horn glow changed colour and brightened. Then it suddenly flashed with a burst of brilliant light the other ponies could feel as well as see through their closed eyes. There was a chorus of pained screeches as the entire area was lit to day-light brightness. The birds broke and fled, but the Blueblood had lurched sickeningly and dropped into a free-fall as she diverted her power into the solar flare spell and the power to the triune became unbalanced.</p><p class="double">The ponies on deck grabbed onto whatever they could find, even Fluttershy, who grabbed onto Big Mac. All of them were screaming, though only Pinkie seemed to be enjoying herself. More importantly, Shining Armour and Rarity were lifted off the deck, out of contact with the diagram. Twilight decided she had to up her game and made her horn shimmer with layers of aura, duplicating how she&#039;d once looked when hauling an Ursa Minor around by the scruff of it&#039;s neck..</p><p class="double">The entire air-ship was enveloped in a purple glow as it slowed down, and the ponies were lowered to the deck. The envelope above was half collapsed, the semi-rigid support structure far more semi than rigid and clearly doing nothing to support them. They watched in awe as Twilight floated above the deck, sparks flying from the tip of her horn. The vision of magical power unleashed spoke to them. “Uh... guys? A little help here?”</p><p class="double">That had Shining Armour and Rarity leaping back to their posts. Twilight lowered herself down and re-established the triune. Rainbow Dash cajoled Fluttershy away from her grasp on Big Mac&#039;s giant wood form, and into helping her shove some clouds underneath the keel. Between them, they brought the Blueblood down relatively unscathed in the clearing Twilight had spotted earlier.</p><p class="double">“Whooe!” Applejack exclaimed, “I knew you had power, I didn&#039;t know you had that much!”</p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s do it again!” Pinkie whooped.</p><p class="double">“That was most impressive.” Rarity was checking over her costume to see the free fall hadn&#039;t carried away anything important.</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed, partly from embarrassment at the success of her ploy. “It was a team effort, all of you helped. Besides, I couldn&#039;t let you all get hurt. I&#039;ve hurt enough ponies already.”</p><p class="double">“My beautiful ship...” Blueblood was examining the collapsed balloon sorrowfully.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I&#039;m sure it can be fixed up, and if it can&#039;t, I&#039;m sure Princess Celestia will replace it. You&#039;ve already gotten us a good part of the way... We were on course, weren&#039;t we?”</p><p class="double">Blueblood sniffed, his depression forgotten at the questioning of his skills. “Of course, assuming those maps you found were accurate! We didn&#039;t have time to drift when those birds attacked.”</p><p class="double">“Those weren&#039;t birds. I think they were a manifestation of Nightmare Moon. We know she likes transformations.” Twilight replied, looking over at timber-wolf Big Mac. “That’s why I could drive them away with a solar flare spell.”</p><p class="double">“Oh great!” Rainbow exclaimed, “That means she knows we&#039;re here! Are we going to get more of those scary-crows?”</p><p class="double">To be honest, Twilight wasn&#039;t sure. The changes she&#039;d made had caused Nightmare Moon to react differently. However, she had a pretty good idea of the being&#039;s general mindset, and she could even justify her conclusions with in-loop knowledge.</p><p class="double">“Not those most probably, but she will keep attacking. However, I don&#039;t think she&#039;ll come at us directly, and not for some time. From what Shining told me, and what we saw at the Town Hall, she doesn&#039;t have massive amounts of power in reserve, not if she wants to keep Princess Celestia bound, and strengthen the bindings to make them permanent.</p><p class="double">“She seems to be a creature of illusions and deceptions, changing forms and twisting minds. Even that attack in the Town Hall was transmutation rather than a direct damage spell. She&#039;ll need to husband her power, building up a reserve to attack us each time, so we should have some respite. It&#039;s also likely she&#039;ll try and trick us, or attack us indirectly through a proxy, rather than wasting power with a direct magic attack.”</p><p class="double">She decided to pull in something else ahead of schedule. “Of course, now that we&#039;re down on the ground, I really wish we had a guide, some-pony who knows the hazards of the Everfree. No offense Prince Blueblood, but while I&#039;m sure you can navigate, navigating it safely is another matter.”</p><p class="double">“Sugar-cube, no-pony knows what lives in the Everfree forest!” Applejack exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Because no-pony that goes in, ever comes out!” Rainbow Dash added, stalking across the deck and making Fluttershy squeak.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked over at the far side of the clearing. Zecora&#039;s hut was just visible beyond a screen of trees. She pointed it out to the others. “Well some-pony lives here.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s crazy, who&#039;d live in the...” Applejack went pale, “Zecora!”</p><p class="double">All the Ponyville ponies shivered at the name. Blueblood and Shining Armour just looked confused.</p><p class="double">“Okay, who is this Zecora, and why does she have you all so scared?” Twilight asked, as if she didn&#039;t know.</p><p class="double">“Because she&#039;s eeeeevil!” Pinkie Pie said, waving her fore-hooves in the air.</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s mysterious and scary...” Fluttershy added.</p><p class="double">“All sinister in her cloak and stuff... Not that I&#039;m scared of her, I&#039;m just... worried, yeah worried about every-pony else!” Rainbow Dash added, though the way she had her wings wrapped around her demonstrated that whatever else, she wasn&#039;t the element of honesty.</p><p class="double">“And she has an absolutely garish colour-scheme! Black and white stripes, can you imagine?” Rarity put in.</p><p class="double">“She comes into town about once a month...” Applejack started, only to be corrected by Pinkie Pie. “... creeps evilly into town...” “... and hangs around the stores...” “... lurks around the stores...” “... and paws at the ground...” “... evilly paws at the ground...”</p><p class="double">Twilight scratched the back of her neck with a hoof. “Still not seeing why every-pony&#039;s scared of her. Doesn&#039;t she buy anything at the stores?”</p><p class="double">“Of course not! Every-pony closes up shop and hides when she comes into town!”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around at her friends. She hadn&#039;t liked this the first time she&#039;d heard it, and it didn&#039;t get any better with repetition. She preferred to think the best of her friends, and this was them showing less than their best selves. “So no-pony&#039;s actually talked to her?”</p><p class="double">There was a chorus of denials.</p><p class="double">“Then how can you know anything about her? Wait... when you said black and white stripes, you didn&#039;t mean her clothing, did you?”</p><p class="double">“No, she dyes her coat and mane that way.” Rarity responded.</p><p class="double">“Then she&#039;s a zebra.” Twilight nodded as if confirming a theory.</p><p class="double">“Is that some sort of evil spell-caster?” Pinkie asked.</p><p class="double">“No, zebras are a race of ponies who live in Zebrica, a land far away to the south, far beyond the Macintosh mountains. They&#039;re most similar to earth-ponies with magic that relates to the earth and growing things. However their saganomas, a combination teacher/healer/mage have learned to use their earth magic to cast spells.”</p><p class="double">“So I was right!” The pink pony exclaimed.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Hardly, saganomas are if anything the opposite. Lacking a horn, they compound spells from magical herbs and plants, or use them as a base to invest their own earth magic. Their magic is all about healing, protection and enhancing living things.”</p><p class="double">“Then why is she always creeping about so creepily?”</p><p class="double">“It sounds like no-pony&#039;s given her a chance to do anything else.” Twilight tried to find a way to get through to them. She decide shock tactics might work best. Her horn glowed and she was suddenly zebra striped, with her mane and tail highlights white against black. The Ponyvillians flinched away, but some-pony else laughed.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s so funny?” Rainbow growled at Blueblood, who was the source of the laughter.</p><p class="double">“Just that you Ponyville ponies can be just as judgmental and wrongheaded as Miss Sparkle claimed I was. It&#039;s refreshing, the light from your halos up until now was making me squint, and that does terrible things to the corners of one&#039;s eyes.”</p><p class="double">That got him annoyed looks from the six Ponyville residents until Twilight put in, “Pinkie, you know that it was your upbeat attitude and friendliness that helped me when I first arrived in Ponyville? I&#039;m just glad I wasn&#039;t wearing this as a disguise, you&#039;d have probably hidden under the counter or just bucked me back out.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour spoke up. “I&#039;ve got to admit I&#039;m finding this a bit strange too. Zebras don&#039;t commonly come to Equestria, they don&#039;t even have a full time ambassador in Canterlot, but I&#039;ve done escort duty for their envoys before now. They&#039;re just another type of pony, nice enough folks, nothing to get worried about. Though I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be too happy if I&#039;d been treated the way you say she has.”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to the others. “Guys, I <i>know</i> you&#039;re better than this, shunning some-pony just because she looks different!”</p><p class="double">Applejack chipped in. “T&#039;ain&#039;t so much that as the fact she lives in the Everfree. What sort of pony would do that?”</p><p class="double">That got relieved agreements from most of them, and Twilight dismissed the disguise. She&#039;d never actually explored why they were so scared of Zecora to this extent, and she was happy to know it was less that she looked different than where she lived.</p><p class="double">“A saganoma, as I said earlier. The Everfree has the largest and weirdest range of magical plants and creatures in the world. Saganomas use magical plants in their spells, it might be enough to tempt one to come here and research them.”</p><p class="double">“Or she could be here because she was cast out because she was doing evil things...” Pinkie suggested. “I even wrote a song about it... &#039;She&#039;s an evil enchantrress! She something something prances... enhances... chances... Francis?”</p><p class="double">She came to a stumbling halt as she tried out rhymes. “Well I started a song about her. It&#039;s a work in progress!”</p><p class="double">“Catchy…” Twilight sighed. “Y&#039;know, it&#039;s possible you&#039;re right, not likely, but I suppose any-pony could go off the rails. Even so, we have to go find out. If she was evil, or even has been turned evil as Princess Luna was by Nightmare Moon... after all, the best of ponies would feel a little unhappy at being shunned like that, and from what I understand, that&#039;s exactly the sort of thing a Nightmare exploits... well anyway, if she&#039;s a threat we have to deal with her before we go on, or risk her attacking from behind while Nightmare Moon comes at us from the front.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shivered again and hid behind Big Mac. “Do we really have to?”</p><p class="double">Oddly enough, it was Big Macintosh who answered her. “Eyup! Miss Sparkle&#039;s makin&#039; a passel of sense. Better to meet Zecora now on our terms, than later on hers, I reckon. Besides, I always figured those tales about her were a heapin&#039; helpin&#039; of hooey.”</p><p class="double">Twilight tried to reassure her. “I&#039;ll approach her. I&#039;ve studied zebra magic and know at least something about its capabilities and its limits. As long as I avoid getting hit by any potions or powders I should be fine. It&#039;s the same for every-pony else too. And it&#039;s not like we don&#039;t have magic of our own.”</p><p class="double">“Ohhh!” Pinkie exclaimed. “What if Nightmare Moon&#039;s granted her some of her power?”</p><p class="double">“I should be able to sense that, I got a pretty good read on her magical signature back in Ponyville. But I doubt it, even if Zecora is in league with Nightmare Moon, the Nightmare isn&#039;t the sort to share power, not when she needs it herself so badly. Hopefully she&#039;s just a regular pony and we can get her as a guide instead. That&#039;s how I intend to approach this.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s all well and fine, Twilight, but what&#039;s to stop her pretending to be all nice and then doing the dirty on us?” Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">“You!” Twilight replied. “Or rather your element. The spirit of the element of honesty is within you, and if you focus on it, you should be able to detect whether she&#039;s telling the truth.”</p><p class="double">“I thought we needed those dinguses from that palace to use the Elements?” Applejack scratched the back of her head with a hoof.</p><p class="double">“Uh huh, we need them reunited to activate their full power and create the sixth element, but the spirit already exists in you. Just concentrate on listening to everything that happens with a open and honest heart, and you should be able to sense the truth. I know it&#039;s a lot to ask for you to put aside your distrust of her, but I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t want to see any-pony treated unfairly.”</p><p class="double">Applejack made a scrunchy face. “If&#039;en you say so Twilight...”</p><p class="double">The group got down from the air-ship deck and approached the hut, which was built into a tree. There was light coming from the window s and a thin trail of multi-coloured smoke issuing from a vent in one of the branches, and masks and vials of various concoctions hung from others.</p><p class="double">Twilight gushed as they got nearer. “Oh my gosh! Real fetish masks! I&#039;ve seen pictures, but the real thing... score one for the good guy theory, some are greetings, and some are specifically designed to ward off evil spirits. Quite powerful too, I can sense them from here. I don&#039;t know if they&#039;d keep off nightmare Moon, but she&#039;d have to work for it. Pinkie, looks like you were half right at least, she&#039;s definitely a saganoma, an enchantress.”</p><p class="double">The others clustered behind her as she called out. “Hello? Is any-pony home?”</p><p class="double">There was no answer for a few moments, then a cloaked figure opened the door. The Ponyville ponies gasped or eeked as their natures led them, but Twilight stood firm. The figure pulled the cloak back to reveal she was Zecora. She spoke in a forbidding voice.</p><p class="double">“Leave this place you pony strangers, the Everfree is full of dangers!”</p><p class="double">“Unfortunately, we can&#039;t. I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle. I believe you are Zecora?”</p><p class="double">“You know my name but still come near me? Unlike these others, you do not fear me?” Zecora was questioning, now and sounded slightly surprised.</p><p class="double">“Should I have reason to?” Twilight asked. “You&#039;re clearly a saganoma, and everything I know about them say they&#039;re healers and teachers, who use their powers to help others not hurt them.”</p><p class="double">Zecora smiled. “You know our ways and speak the truth, but your companions clearly need more proof. When to the village I essay, every-pony runs away.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry you were treated like that, but I hope it won&#039;t prejudice you against my request. You&#039;ve noticed the sun hasn&#039;t come up on schedule?”</p><p class="double">“Even now I make a brew to scry the cause and what to do.”</p><p class="double">“I can help you there.” Twilight explained what had just happened in Ponyville. She gave Zecora the hoof-clipping version of Nightmare Moon&#039;s origin, and how she was defeated the first time. She did a quick and very obvious scan spell to detect if Nightmare Moon was anywhere in the area (which also encompassed Zecora) before continuing. </p><p class="double">“The only way to stop Nightmare Moon as far as we know is to find the Elements. According to our information the Palace of the Two Pony Sisters deep in the Everfree is the place to look. We were headed there by air-ship, but we were forced down. We will have to continue on hoof, but we need a guide, some-pony who knows the dangers of the Everfree and how to avoid them. Right now, the only pony who fits the bill is you.”</p><p class="double">The zebra looked thoughtful. “It&#039;s true those ruins I do know, and find the safest ways to go...” She glanced at the Ponyville mares. “...my presence though <i>they</i> won&#039;t abide, a grave shortcoming in a guide.”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle turned to look at the still nervous mane cast. “Guys, I&#039;ve scanned the area, no signs of Nightmare Moon&#039;s contamination anywhere. And Zecora is willing to help us. I think we should at least say thank you. Applejack?”</p><p class="double">The mare in question had done her best to quell her fear and listen to the exchanges. Twilight was setting great store by this element business, and while she was pleased by the complement, the farm mare wasn&#039;t exactly sold on the idea that she had some mystical magic power inside her... apart from the standard issue earth pony ones. However, Applejack had never been a quitter, and she prided herself on being dependable.</p><p class="double">So she&#039;d done her best to listen to what the striped mare was saying, and so far, it hadn&#039;t been anything like she&#039;d expected. Her weird way of rhyming wasn&#039;t normal, but the words held little of the rancor she&#039;d expected. Indeed, she sounded a lot like a younger version of Granny Smith, wise and self assured. Something inside Applejack resonated with that, made her want to trust the other mare, but she mentally shied back.</p><p class="double">What if it was a trick, what about the stories... Now she thought back on them, her stubborn sense of integrity was worrying at them. How exactly had they started? She couldn&#039;t remember, but they were things every-pony knew... of course, Granny Smith always said &#039;If every-pony knows it, but no-pony can prove it, there&#039;s a good chance every-ponies wrong.&#039;</p><p class="double">She made a decision. It wasn&#039;t an easy decision, or a comfortable one, but it felt like the right one. “Ah apologise Miss Zecora. I normally have better manners. I&#039;m Applejack and I&#039;d be only too glad to ask you to lead us through the forest.” She looked over at the others. “Folks, I think we&#039;ve been doing the lady a disservice, both here and in Ponyville. I intend to make amends. Miss Zecora, when next you come to town, please stop on by Sweet Apple Acres and I&#039;ll make you one of my special apple pies.”</p><p class="double">The zebra smiled. “Your change of heart is most insightful. The pie too would be most delightful.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shrugged and called down from where she was hovering. “I guess if Applejack thinks your on the level, I&#039;m okay with it. I&#039;m Rainbow Dash, Dash to my friends, awesome to every-pony else. Welcome aboard.”</p><p class="double">Rarity hesitated for a moment, then put on a warm smile. She&#039;d been a part of the gossip, but she knew how that same gossip could get out of hoof, and now she met the pony face to face, she was feeling more than slightly guilty over her part in shunning the zebra, especially as both Twilight and Applejack had given her the all clear. Not to mention it rankling that <i>Blueblood</i> of all ponies had called her on it. The generous side of her nature kicked in.</p><p class="double">“Rarity, maker of fine couture. I should apologise as well. If you are in need of a new cloak or something I would be only to happy to supply it.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy just squeaked &#039;I&#039;m sorry!&#039;, but gave a nod.</p><p class="double">Pinkie was the hardest sell. She gave an uncharacteristic frown, staring at the zebra but finally gave an equally uncharacteristic sigh. “Okie-dokie-lokie! But I&#039;ll be watching...”</p><p class="double">The zebra mare actually laughed. “Pink pony, what do you think I&#039;d do? Gobble you up in a big tasty stew?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie brightened up. “Hey, that&#039;s a good line! I can use that!”</p><p class="double">The stallions were a lot less trouble, they introduced themselves, and then Twilight looked around at the newly enlarged. Party. As Zecora slung a set of oddly shaped saddle-bags over her flanks, the purple unicorn asked, “Shall we get on then? We&#039;ve still got a long way to go.” </p><p><hr></p><p>30.2</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So... let me get this straight. Twilight walked in on ya with a bunch o&#039; duplicates of her brother?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis flinched. &quot;It wasn&#039;t like I planned it. The hive took the initiative to comfort me. And we didn&#039;t do anything, you know, I know how intimate you ponies think sex is....&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh raised an eyebrow. &quot;Ah&#039;d say it&#039;s more then just us ponies--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Basically, as Changeling Queen, I&#039;m in charge of having everyone else&#039;s eggs.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a quiet moment.</p><p class="double">Finally, the stallion managed a strangled cough. &quot;Why is it Ah&#039;m always tha one that people explain weird sex things to?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because you serve the best cider.&quot; Chrysalis held forth her mug expectantly, and he filled it without thinking. &quot;Anyway, my point <i>was</i> that I wasn&#039;t aching for a good rut. Frankly, I can get that anywhere, just shapeshift and flirt. But what I had with Shi--well, with <i>my</i> Shining was more then that, and that&#039;s what the hive mind tried to mimic. It kind of worked... in the same way that sugar-free chocolate replacement stuff kind of tastes like Pinkie&#039;s best brownies. So... they decided to multiply the experience...&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh nodded. &quot;Ah see. And that&#039;s when Twilight walked in on ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot; She threw back her muzzle, draining her mug in one big gulp. &quot;I wish I got drunk easier. Half of this is going straight to my mane...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... from tha sound of it... the hive mind <i>was</i> trying ta help ya. In its own way.&quot; The stallion shook his head. &quot;Never really understood it mahself, but from what mah sister and her friends have told me it&#039;s something real... deep.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis regarded him with a curious look. &quot;How would they know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Most o&#039; them have been changelings in one loop or another. Apparently there was even one time where they all were changelings. Heck, Ah&#039;d say tha majority of Equestrian loopers have been in tha hive, cepting mahself fer some reason. Oh, and tha nonpony loopers, like Spike or Discord.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. Discord?&quot; The changeling queen leaned forward. &quot;As in, primordial manifestation of Chaos Discord? He&#039;s looping? That explains so much--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No it don&#039;t. He was always like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...oh. Huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup, that was mah reaction too.&quot; Macintosh shrugged. &quot;Anyway, what Ah&#039;m saying is Ah don&#039;t really get tha hive mind. Yet. Ah&#039;m pretty much resigned to tha fact that Ah&#039;m going ta end up there in some loop. What&#039;s it like, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Didn&#039;t you just say that Twilight and her friends told you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... they were in it fer a few loops at most. You&#039;ve lived with it yer whole life. Makes sense ya&#039;d have a different take on it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. &quot;There is... an old adage. The hive serves the swarm, the swarm serves the queen, the queen serves the hive. It&#039;s... difficult to explain, but... while I have a level of control over the swarm, and I mean actual control and not just the political power that Celestia has over the nobles, the hive is something I... don&#039;t control. If a drone feels that something about what I want them to do is wrong, I can feel it no matter whether I order them to do it or not. Being a queen means you get to make all the decisions, but it also means you feel all the repercussions. Personally, I mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">She sighed. &quot;It&#039;s part of why... well, in my baseline loop, anyway, it was part of why I wasn&#039;t at all worried about attacking ponies. I could slap you right now and read your emotions, but... it&#039;s like the difference between reading a letter and talking to a friend, I suppose. Or maybe listening to a song instead of a speech... Something in that way. The others, they probably see the hive as more intimate, but from my view it&#039;s ponies that are less intimate. And when I was just a queen, I thought that meant you <i>cared</i> less then changelings did, that somehow you were... broken, and it was okay for me to consider you all basically talking prey that we could capture and raise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh realized where she was going with this, pouring more cider into her mug. &quot;But then Shining happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Not just him. He was a big part, but that whole loop was... different. Hives were smaller, and Celestia exterminated us when she could because she believed in preemptive strikes; the other nobles went along with it because the branding magical stuff didn&#039;t work on shapeshifters. And between that and all the slaves running through the underground, I realized that just because you can&#039;t... feel each other, that doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t care. In fact I found that your love can sometimes go deeper, exactly because you&#039;re so alone and want to let the other one know you care.&quot; Chrysalis brought her mug to her lips... and peered at it. &quot;See, this is what I&#039;m talking about right here. If you were part of the hive, you would feel what I was feeling and have filled this without me asking because you knew I was becoming emotional. But you&#039;re not, and you&#039;re not even empathetic... but you know me enough to predict I needed this. How do you do that? How can you read me when you don&#039;t even speak that language? How has your race survived this long without being able to communicate on that level, and yet somehow managed to form deeper relations in that void?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah ain&#039;t no philosopher,&quot; Macintosh began slowly, &quot;but if Ah were ta seriously consider that question... Ah&#039;d say that it&#039;s exactly because we don&#039;t have such close understandings of each other that we strive ta form deep relations. If&#039;n we knew what we&#039;d each be doing all tha time, we wouldn&#039;t be driven ta understand each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But... you could hurt each other. On accident, even.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.... and that&#039;s part of why we try to understand.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen sipped her cider. She still didn&#039;t quite understand... but that viewpoint would be one she would have to consider. </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">30.3</p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Shining Armor asked, frowning. “Is this correct?”</p><p class="double">“Is what correct, BBBFF?” Twilight replied, still scanning over the list as she helped things get set up for the Equestria Games.</p><p class="double">“Well, I was looking over the contestant list, and… you’ve only put down <i>three</i>.”</p><p class="double">Twilight craned her head to look. “Uh… yep, that’s right. That’s the only entrants we’re sending.”</p><p class="double">“For <i>all</i> the games?” Shining shook his head. “Twilight, I know that Ponyville is a small town, relatively speaking, but usually small towns take this as an opportunity for everypony to show off their talents. You know, have a bit of fun.”</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry.” Twilight shrugged. “We’ll be fine.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Rainbow Dash hunched down, grinning like a loon. Her wings flared up to give her a starter’s boost, and when the gate came down-</p><p class="double">She finished, sat down on the other side of the tape, and began eating a snack carrot.</p><p><hr></p><p>“Wait, what just happened?” the race marshal said, checking a stopwatch. “That was… did she seriously do the marathon in ten seconds flat?”</p><p class="double">“Nine point nine three,” Rainbow said, then frowned and threw her carrot away. “Man, I must be putting on weight… I’m getting slow.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight ticked the first box on her checklist. “Right, that’s swifter done…”</p><p><hr></p><p>Fluttershy looked up at the high jump, wings strapped. “Er… I have to get over that?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, you do,” a helper said helpfully. “Just do your best.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” The shy pegasus crouched down, then sprang…</p><p class="double">And just kept on going up.</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight ticked the second box, <i>higher</i>, as Fluttershy cleared the cross-bar. “Certainly helps if you’ve got literal control over the muscles in your legs… and weighing as little as <i>she</i> does can’t hurt either. Right, two down, one to go.”</p><p><hr></p><p>Applejack slammed her front hooves on the arena floor. “An’ who else is after a go at me?”</p><p class="double">All the other competitors looked at her. Then they looked at the huge pegasus embedded in a wall.</p><p class="double">“None of y’all? Aww, that ain’t fair on me…”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Twilight, that was a terrible thing you did there,” Celestia admonished, covering her mouth to hide a smile.</p><p class="double">“I know, I know…” Twilight shrugged, passing over the scroll with <i>stronger</i> ticked next to the other two. “Normally we sit them out, but I felt like they needed a go at least once. Especially Fluttershy.”</p><p class="double">“True, she’s not exactly the most confident of ponies…” the Princess allowed, accepting the scroll. “Strange how much ponies stay the same, in the loops.”</p><p class="double">“I think it’s because she actually <i>likes</i> being shy, you know…” Twilight ventured. “It’s a part of how she is, and it makes her more sure she’s not going to offend anypony. And she hates to offend…”</p><p class="double">“Most insightful,” Celestia said, nodding to Twilight. “Well, do congratulate your friends. And I might well award copper medals this Games, because otherwise it’s just going to not be fair on the ponies who <i>would</i> have been third place.”</p><p class="double">“I’m wondering how we’re going to get Dash home, actually,” Twilight confided. “That many medals might actually impede her takeoff.”</p><p><hr></p><p>30.4 (Elmagnifico)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed as he trotted through Ponyville, the day’s load of apples for market creaking along behind him. It was just after the start of a fresh reunion, and the denizens were just starting to get back to normal after the Summer Sun Celebration. Thus far, no-one had disturbed his routine. None of his sisters were Awake, and nothing remarkable had happened. He’d delivered the apple to the library on schedule. Nightmare Moon had been vanquished with a zebra potion, two pry bars and several metric tons of fruitcake. A slow day outside the bar, a good sign for the loop. </p><p class="double">Spike waved to him as he passed by on his way to Celestia-knew-where. The little drake was friendly enough, in fact the two of them were pretty close to brothers-in-arms, being the only male Loopers aside from Twilight’s brother, who was a decent stallion too. Overall, a good friend, and seeing as how he was Awake, not in need of Mac’s immediate attention. He was confident Spike could handle whatever the loops threw and if he needed assistance with something the others couldn’t help with, he’d seek Mac out. Even his ability to turn into a ten-story powerhouse hardly made Mac twitch anymore. </p><p class="double">It hadn’t always been that way though. </p><p class="double">When he’d first been introduced to the community of Loopers, he’d seen big things. The most obvious, of course, being the extra parts each of Applejack’s friends were able to sprout at will. Others included subspace pockets, glowing swords, hornless telekinesis and underground bases with flying machines and fusion reactors. So many things were different among the Loopers. </p><p class="double">Applebloom jumped off the cart and trotted away, as the way to school diverged from the route to market. She shouted a goodbye over her shoulder as Mac watched her, frowning in thought but paused to wave in case she looked back. Oftentimes the bullying on that front was solved in as simple a way as having a conversation with Filthy Rich, although it’d taken a few attempts to get the phrasing right so that Diamond Tiara would be chastised. Being too direct with the well-to-do pony didn’t get anywhere. </p><p class="double">At first, the Loopers had presented a problem. Applejack’s friends were important ponies, helping them helped all of Equestria, not only because they were Elements of Harmony, but because helping them headed off a lot of the larger problems around Ponyville during the loop. So, over the course of his Loops he’d gotten to know them rather well, helping each with their issues and getting it down to the point where, all other things being equal, Ponyville stayed rather quiet after the initial Nightmare Night bump. </p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash zoomed overhead, her contrail reminding Macintosh he needed to get in touch with her soon. Now that the Celebration was over, she’d be more obsessed with the Wonderbolts than ever. It would take a while to establish contact, and most of his help would be second or third-hoof. He really never came into contact with her unless something went drastically wrong, usually with one of her manoeuvres, either sending her crashing into something on the Acres, or himself. </p><p class="double">Naturally, each change he’d made had altered how things played out, which meant new issues would crop up from the fresh circumstances. Over time he’d honed his perception, allowing him to preempt trouble and head off developing problems before they hurt anyone. He’d gotten especially good at reading the Elements. </p><p class="double">He waved as he passed the unawake Rarity, doubtless on her way back to the Carousel Boutique. Her input would be needed later to alter how Applejack prepped her food stall for the Grand Galloping Gala, with fewer, more refined baked goods and the like. Blunting the unfortunate and unavoidable disappointment with Blueblood would come after. </p><p class="double">Only now, they were completely different. He knew almost nothing about these ponies, and they’d already solved their problems their own way. Moreover, with all the horns and wings showing up, he’d had a hard time keeping up with the Loopers. Getting under their masks when they were around Ponyville was hard, as, like him, they’d be trying to blend in. When they weren’t trying to keep things close to baseline, he felt left behind as the phenomenal cosmic power and strange magic started flying willy-nilly. Helping was hard when you were too busy dodging disintegration spells to watch anyone else. </p><p class="double">Fluttershy meeped in surprise as he left her a smile. He often wound up spending a disproportionate amount of time around her, as preempting the parasprites was easier said than done. She was a delicate case indeed, as increasing her confidence without doing the same harm as that Minotaur was a balancing act that left almost no margin for error. </p><p class="double">It wasn’t until Applejack awoke one loop and stayed in her bed, fitfully dreaming, through the whole Reunion, only to proceed down to the cellar and drink their entire stock of her namesake, along with the rest of the alcohol, that Mac found his place in the Loops. Being the queen of the Changelings had rattled his sister fiercely, and left her needing family and counselling, in that order. Twilight had been eager to assist Mac with his sister, and together they’d helped her cope. </p><p class="double">He responded to Time Turner’s query about Applejack’s recovery with an “Eeyup.” The Celebration usually left his sister fatigued, both physically and mentally, even if the Elements weren’t used to defeat Nightmare Moon. Having a Goddess of the Night dropped on the town tended to have that effect. Applejack hated being useless, and now she was taking it relatively easy at the Acres, just a few light chores. Of course, that meant he had to pick up the slack, but by now he knew just how much he could push himself before getting injured. </p><p class="double">It was during that session of post-hive-mind therapy that Macintosh realized these ponies needed his help just as much as their non-looping selves did. Of course, chasing them around to watch them and try to preempt problems was a fruitless dream. He simply didn’t Loop enough for that. There was too much separation for him to help the Anchor and her friends the way he did Ponyville. </p><p class="double">He returned Cherilee’s smile as usual. He normally kept his distance from the schoolmarm at first, although he did have to watch his beverages in February. That particular thread usually resolved itself with subtle changes in how he acted around Applebloom, with hints he was interested in this mare or that one, nothing blatant or false, but enough to keep him off the &quot;eligible bachelors&quot; list. Getting Cherilee to change the timing of the field trip until one of the Crusader’s less chaotic periods was the real challenge. </p><p class="double">So, he’d started a bar. Alcohol still held its allure even for Loopers, and Apples knew how to brew the best stuff. Moreover, its presence relaxed most ponies, allowing him to see under the barriers they had erected to keep out the strife and erosion of time. It also allowed them to come and seek him out if they needed help or guidance, even if initiating therapy was often disguised, or rationalized, as a request for booze. </p><p class="double">He passed Lily and her friends, which brought Zecora to mind. That, at least, was as simple as helping Applejack see through the rumours and hearsay surrounding the zebra. After her sense of truth was applied properly to the situation, his sister handled that well enough by herself. </p><p class="double">Nevertheless, the bar was a small thing. Everything had to be available at loop’s start in case of an emergency, so he kept the furnishings to a minimum. After all, he’d only made it a public establishment in three especially crowded loops, after which he’d decided it was better to keep things simple. The Apple cellar served just as well as an above-ground building for Looper purposes. Wooden furniture was simple and common, but also relaxing, homely and unassuming. A stone fireplace made the place cozy and required minimal modification of the basement, aside from the ventilation. Overall, it reminded him of the small pubs he’d seen the one time the Loops had moved Ponyville to the Northern Dales, albeit with a more varied selection on tap. </p><p class="double">He halted as Berry Punch teetered across the street in front of him, thoroughly sloshed as per normal. No helping that, unfortunately. </p><p class="double">Most loops the emergency stock of Hard Cider was enough to tide over thirsty patrons until he could start brewing for larger crowds, although there were a couple barrels and microbrews he asked Twilight to keep in her subspace pocket and drop off at her earliest convenience whenever he was Awake. He was saving those for a special occasion. </p><p class="double">He noted the extra spring in Pinkie Pie’s step as she passed him on the way to Sugarcube Corner. Looper or not, he wasn’t sure. Maybe she was just happy because of the baked-goods manner in which the Alicorn of the Night had been defeated. He could never be sure with her. </p><p class="double">The pink mare had always been an enigma to him, in some ways worse than Ms. Sparkle because she stood up to close scrutiny and remained just as unfathomable whether she was looping or not. He could tell the difference, it just didn&#039;t help any in predicting her. Distracting her on her birthday had been easy enough. Physically bumping into her, apologizing and then helping her with some baking seemed enough, although her sheer variability meant nothing was certain. </p><p class="double">Nevertheless, she proved an ally more often than not. After all, their missions were similar. Indeed, oftentimes there was little that would help ponies more than a smile or a good laugh, and that was something Pinkie Pie excelled at giving. Conversely, Mac was always happy to cater or host a party. Stress relief and games were a good way to blow off steam, and it lightened his workload when he didn’t have to pour every drink himself. </p><p class="double">He was almost to the market when he spotted Twilight Sparkle a little ways off, conversing with a pegasus he didn’t recognize. Spike and a small black dragon were behind them, apparently comparing notes of some sort. They all waved, and Twilight looked like she was moving to intercept, so he’d likely be introduced to these newcomers. A fused loop? </p><p class="double">Mac gave the oncoming party a welcoming smile and mentally sighed as he bid any hopes of a quiet loop goodbye.</p><p><hr></p><p>30.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...so why isn&#039;t Silver looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom gave Diamond Tiara a look as she drove in the next piton. &quot;Yer asking this <i>now?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you rather I whine about how hard this is?&quot; the purple filly countered, panting as she attempted to reach another hoofhold. &quot;Cause, you know, I could do that if you like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh. Point.&quot; Bloom stretched, barely managing to grab an outcropping of rock. &quot;But that was only a five.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tiara snorted. &quot;Oh darn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, so... ya know how Twilight&#039;s tha anchor?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah?&quot; The purple filly pushed herself up. &quot;That means she loops all the time, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah. More important, though, that means all tha looping... loopiness, Ah guess, flows from her. And if thar&#039;s enough loopiness, thar&#039;s a new looper. Ah think.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not sure?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom pulled another piton out of her backpack. &quot;Well, Ah&#039;m trying ta explain something that Twilight told me with all tha technobabble she explained. It might be that it&#039;s looseness in tha memory network of our reality or somethang... she has holographic diagrams, Ah&#039;m simplifying.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s back hoof slipped off. &quot;AAA! Ah, sorry, I&#039;m okay, I&#039;m fine.&quot; She panted as she recovered her footing. &quot;Alright, so... Twilight&#039;s the center of looping. Got that. And things get loopier over time....?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tha thing is, tha loopiness travels along... channels made by deep emotional impact. So, it went from her ta her friends first. Then it went from her to tha princesses. Then it went from her, through Applejack and Rarity and Rainbow Dash, to tha Crusaders....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.&quot; The rich filly nodded to herself. &quot;I&#039;m beginning to see the pattern. Friends first?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Friends, family... and some pretty personal enemies.&quot; The farm filly nodded at her piton, pulling herself up. &quot;Like Chrysalis, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, Chrysalis? As in the Changeling Queen? She&#039;s looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup. Took her a while, but tha fact is she did leave a deep emotional impact on Twilight in tha baseline, so all Twilight had ta do was focus on her a bit more. Ah hate ta say it but, well, tha reason ya probably started looping is cause ya bullied us so intensely. Silver Spoon was always just following yer lead, so we didn&#039;t care that much about her. She&#039;s got a deeper channel ta you, o&#039; course, but by tha time tha loopiness reaches ya--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m too far out from the center.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah. Fer now anyway.&quot; Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Could be she gets in, eventually. Heck, if ya like, me and tha other crusaders could try ta be her friends fer tha next few loops, it would give her a better chance of waking up... Ah think. Ah&#039;m not sure.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara considered it. &quot;I... don&#039;t want to force you to do anything you don&#039;t want to, but... well, she was my first friend. If you would try, that would mean a lot to me...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh. Ah&#039;ll bring it up at tha next Crusader meeting. Course, Loopiness is a tad bit random. Sometimes ponies start looping when it don&#039;t make no sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean like Nyx?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Apple Bloom lugged herself onto a ledge and pulled Diamond Tiara up. &quot;She&#039;s one example, yeah, but Ah was thinking more like Berry Punch.&quot;</p><p class="double">The rich filly blinked. &quot;Wait, Berry Punch? The town drunk? She&#039;s looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, once or twice. Doesn&#039;t make sense ta me either. By all rights Granny Smith shoulda been looping by now, and Berry oughta have been further out. Still... ya get what ya get, Ah guess. And it&#039;s not like it&#039;s anything as consistent as you or me anyway...&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>31.1 (Anowack)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis, Queen of the Changeling Swam, actually had been quite fond of tea.</p><p class="double">It was a habit she&#039;d picked up from one of the first ponies she had fed on extensively, a middle-aged divorced mare in Manehatten with a weak spot for young fillies with sob stories, too much spare time under her hooves, and a dangerously unquestioning nature. The scent and taste of the beverage brought memories of those simpler days to Chrysalis&#039;s mind, and in her personal chambers deep inside the hive could be found the battered tea set she&#039;d stolen after the mare had died, along with some small containers of carefully hoarded leaves.</p><p class="double">She hadn&#039;t drank tea since she had started Looping. The once fond memories were now tainted by the gnawing sensation of guilt. She half-feared, half-hoped that if she dared to dwell on those days too much she would find that she missed the aging pony who had always been ready to offer her a cup of tea, two chocolate chip cookies, and a shoulder to fake-sob on.</p><p class="double">“Would you prefer something else to drink?” the mare seated across the small table from the changeling queen asked.</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s fine,” Chrysalis answered, staring morosely at Cadance&#039;s reflection in the still, gently steaming liquid. That was the last form she wanted to take – she could have gone a thousand Loops without ever seeing that pink-furred face again – but her companion had offered it as a simple way for them to have their conversation in pleasant surroundings without attracting unwanted attention.</p><p class="double">Indeed the various ponies who passed by the balcony where they sat barely gave the two (apparent) alicorns having tea a second glance, but Chrysalis was fairly certain the suggestion had been a way to put her off balance, or a test, or both.</p><p class="double">If it was a test, she had probably failed, she concluded, but it was too late now.</p><p class="double">“I must admit I was surprised when Rainbow Dash brought you to me,” Princess Celestia said as she raised her own tea in golden light and took a sip.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t need to explain why. “I&#039;m not sure of the details myself. I didn&#039;t even realize what was happening at first.” Chrysalis caught herself before saying &#039;Princess Twilight,&#039; the habit of her second lifetime still hard to break. “Twilight Sparkle has an explanation for why I started to Loop that she is satisfied with, at least.”</p><p class="double">“Not that. After Nyx, I expect I shall hardly ever be surprised by who can start Looping again.” The true alicorn chuckled briefly. “Usually I&#039;ve heard of newcomers from Twilight several Loops before getting a chance to meet them myself.”</p><p class="double">There was an awkward silence for several moments.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve not spoken with her of me?” Chrysalis asked finally.</p><p class="double">“No,” Celestia said.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039;s throat was dry suddenly, and she forced herself to take a gulp of the tea before speaking. If Twilight hadn&#039;t explained, she could only imagine what Celestia was thinking, what she might do. The green aura engulfing her teacup flickered for an instant. “I swear,” Chrysalis said quickly. “I am no threat to Equestria, to your ponies.”</p><p class="double">Celestia put down her teacup. Chrysalis followed suit a second later, trying not to squirm under the Princess&#039;s piercing gaze. This was the real Princess Celestia, veteran of probably more Loops than Chrysalis could imagine. She was no doubt vastly stronger than either Celestia Chrysalis had fought before, fully capable of squashing her like... well, a bug. She certainly had done it, too, dozens or hundreds of times.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re terrified of me,” Celestia said, something in her voice the changeling couldn&#039;t identify.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked down, strands of Cadance&#039;s tri-colored mane falling through her vision. “Of course,” she whispered.</p><p class="double">“Look up,” Celestia ordered, and Chrysalis obeyed immediately. “Why?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis felt her mouth open in surprise. “Who wouldn&#039;t be?” she asked without thinking, dumbfounded.</p><p class="double">It couldn&#039;t be hurt she saw in the Princess&#039;s eyes. “I would think one of the very few who can say they defeated me fairly in single combat,” she said. Her mouth twitched briefly. “Over a dozen times from my perspective. You&#039;re shockingly powerful when well-fed.”</p><p class="double">The last thing Chrysalis needed was a reminder that Celestia had cause to seek <i>personal</i> revenge. She didn&#039;t dare look away, couldn&#039;t move.</p><p class="double">Celestia frowned. “You said you didn&#039;t realize you were Looping at first.”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Tears welled unbidden in Chrysalis&#039;s eyes. “I thought the... real timeline, was a dream.”</p><p class="double">“What happened?” Celestia asked. “<i>What did I do?</i>”</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight Sparkle had known this would be an interesting loop from the moment she&#039;d Awoken as a pegasus filly in the sky city of Cloudsdale. A memory check showed her family had been similarly transformed and transported, while a brief investigation discovered that Rainbow Dash – the only other Element Awake this time – and her family had taken their place as Canterlot unicorns.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re really doing better, Fluttershy,” Twilight encouraged her friend, gesturing with one wing to try and get the yellow filly to fly the short distance between her cloud and the one Twilight rested on. Twilight knew that in the original timeline Rainbow Dash hadn&#039;t befriended Fluttershy until some months down the line, but she hadn&#039;t seen any reason to wait. “You&#039;ll be ready for summer flight camp in no time.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy inched up to the edge of her cloud, peeking out from behind her hooves. “It&#039;s so far.”</p><p class="double">Twilight didn&#039;t know whether she meant the distance between them or the distance to the foundation cloud below, but neither was terribly long. “You&#039;ll be fine, Fluttershy,” she said comfortingly. “I promise.”</p><p class="double">Instead of taking heart, Fluttershy gasped and scooted back.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy? What&#039;s wrong?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Somepony&#039;s coming!” The yellow filly hunkered down, trying to sink into the cloud.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around and laughed when she saw the older, white pegasus flying closer. “Don&#039;t worry; I know her.”</p><p class="double">The mare settled onto the cloud next to her. “Hi, Twily; is this your new friend?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “This is Fluttershy.” The named filly let out a quiet whimper. “Fluttershy, this is my big sister, Gleaming Shield.” It wasn&#039;t the first time Twilight&#039;s sibling had been a mare, or a pegasus, but Twilight was fairly sure it was for both at once. (Twilight had checked, and Cadance was still female this Loop. That hadn&#039;t stopped her from getting together with Gleaming in a few past Loops, though the fact that Twilight&#039;s sister was currently dating a stallion she&#039;d met training for Wonderbolts tryouts suggested this Loop might be an exception.)</p><p class="double">“Hi!” Gleaming said, waving a hoof at Fluttershy, then looking at Twilight. “Twily, there&#039;s a filly named Sunny Skies at home asking for you. Says you need to work on a project for school?”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned, just long enough for Gleaming to notice, then quickly forced a smile. “I&#039;d almost forgotten that. I&#039;m sorry, Fluttershy, I have to go. I&#039;ll see you tomorrow, okay?”</p><p class="double">Twilight took the quiet noise from her friend as assent, and shortly thereafter was back at home, alone in her room with a pale-furred, pink-maned filly about her age. “Is something wrong, Princess Celestia?” she asked her visitor.</p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash brought me a surprising guest this morning,” Celestia said.</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“I had a very interesting and informative conversation over tea with Queen Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Twilight said again, a little more weakly.</p><p class="double">“Twilight, why didn&#039;t you tell me?” Celestia&#039;s voice was sad.</p><p class="double">“I was planning to play some kind of prank on you with her,” Twilight said. “She&#039;s... a little unsure of herself and her place now; I thought that would help break the ice.” And the look on Celestia&#039;s face would have almost certainly been priceless.</p><p class="double">Celestia just looked at the other filly for a moment. “That&#039;s not what I meant, and I think you know it, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">Twilight swallowed. “Oh,” she said one more time. She forced a laugh. “It&#039;s hardly the first time I&#039;ve had to fight a version of you in a weird Loop.”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Celestia agreed. “You&#039;ve stopped me as Infernal Blaze from roasting Equestria under eternal day and asked me to critique your strategy the next time we met. You teased me about the Loop where I was Discord&#039;s queen for what must have been a thousand years at least from your perspective. We dealt with that version of me trying to forcefully transform all of Earth into ponies together.</p><p class="double">“You didn&#039;t want to talk to me about this Loop.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sat back and tried to find words. She didn&#039;t want to talk about it, but she knew better. “Those ponies might have been Celestia, but they weren&#039;t <i>you</i>,” she said finally.</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled slightly. “We don&#039;t quite have the right words in our language for the Loops, do we?” she asked.</p><p class="double">“I have a paper I wrote one Loop somewhere,” Twilight said, eager to change the subject, and started searching her subspace pocket.</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s smile widened, but she turned serious again quickly. “I assure you, Twilight. If I had been Awake that Loop, you would have been well aware within moments.” Her voice promised cleansing solar fires that probably would not have actually ensued – as viscerally satisfying as it might have been, Celestia of course knew that destruction would not have really solved anything.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “That&#039;s not what I meant.” She glanced about her room for inspiration, finally hitting on a photo of her sister from her time at the Wonderbolts Academy. “In this loop, my sister is aiming to join the Wonderbolts, like baseline Rainbow Dash,” she said after a moment. Celestia nodded, and Twilight continued. “It&#039;s not so different from how Shining wanted to join your Guard. She and her coltfriend sneak around the same way Shining and Cadance did. She <i>is</i> Shining.”</p><p class="double">“I think I catch your meaning,” Celestia said, her small filly&#039;s wings shuffling slightly, “but I am not sure I like it.”</p><p class="double">“You think I <i>do</i>?” Twilight Sparkle asked, more harshly than she intended. “The Infernal Blazes, the tyrant Empresses, the crazed madmares; they aren&#039;t you. They are different ponies.”</p><p class="double">“And this Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“That Celestia bought me off the auction block at the Royal Canterlot Slave market, separating me from my family for what that me knew was almost certainly forever,” Twilight said, “but she also held me when I cried that night. When we fought she almost cried herself as she begged me to explain why I rebelled. She loved me, I think, maybe as much as you do.”</p><p class="double">“If she did,” Celestia said angrily, “she would never have allowed you to be a slave. Do you think so little of me, Twilight Sparkle?”</p><p class="double">“No!” Twilight said, too loudly. “It&#039;s... if she&#039;d been <i>evil</i>, it would have been easy. But she wasn&#039;t. She was almost you. I could look at her and see you. She spoke like you, acted like you, fought like you.”</p><p class="double">“Except she was a slaver,” Celestia said.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight said. “Except for that. And I loved her, that Loop&#039;s me. I hated her, but I loved her too, and I hated myself for loving her. And I... <i>this</i> me... I feel like I failed you somehow. She was almost you, and I hurt her terribly and...”</p><p class="double">Celestia reached over and hugged her. “I won&#039;t forgive you, Twilight Sparkle,” she said softly, and the purple pegasus sobbed, “but only because I know you did nothing that needs forgiveness. But I can tell you, that if that Celestia really was almost me, if she really did love you like I do, she forgave you in the end, no matter how badly you think you hurt her.”</p><p class="double">Twilight couldn&#039;t stop crying, burying her face under Celestia&#039;s wing. “I&#039;m sorry,” she said.</p><p class="double">“I told you,” Celestia said. “You did nothing wrong.”</p><p class="double">“I... we should have had this conversation Loops ago,” Twilight said, slowly disentangling herself. “I&#039;m sorry for that.”</p><p class="double">“For that, I do forgive you,” Celestia said, smiling gently.</p><p class="double">There was a knocking on Twilight&#039;s door. “Is everything okay in there, Twilight?” her father asked, a little worry plain in his voice.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight said, her voice steady. “We&#039;re fine now.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.2 (Masterweaver, Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Space.... the final frontier.</p><p class="double">These are the voyages of the starship Ponydrive. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life, and new civilization. To boldly go where noone has gone before.</p><p class="double">We join our crew as captain Twilight Sparkle strides onto the bridge.

You&#039;d need a lot more then a simple science survey to stumble a Positronic Intelligence Equestrian!&quot; The pink pony leans back. &quot;Truth be told, it&#039;s been kind of boring. Don&#039;t these loops usually have some sort of excitement in them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I agree with Pinkie.&quot; A blue pegasus glances up from her console, flicking her rainbow mane out of the way. &quot;I mean, I&#039;m the chief of security, and things look pretty darn secure!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That means you&#039;re doing your job right, <i>lieutenant.</i>&quot; An ivory unicorn gives her a serious look. &quot;Stay in character, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, fine Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Commander, sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirks. &quot;Apology accepted, Lieutenant Dash. Lieutenant Pinkie, keep up the scans.&quot; She sits in her chair, stretching out her hooves. &quot;So, Spike, anything on the comm channels?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not yet, Captain.&quot; A small dragon sighs. &quot;We&#039;re in a completely dead system, near as I can tell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were away from the bridge for a rather long time,&quot; Rarity comments. &quot;What kept you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, well... Fluttershy and Sweetie had a very interesting experiment going on down in the labs. Apparently they were attempting to standardize healing songspells.&quot; Twilight coughs. &quot;I may have gotten a bit carried away talking magic with the doctor. Sweetie tried to keep up, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">The commander chuckles and shakes her head. &quot;You really must keep a lid on those impulses or you&#039;ll drive our poor consular mad!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t help it! It&#039;s practical magic in a sci-fi setting, do you know how hard it is for me to study that kind of thing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow leans over the banister. &quot;I would have thought you&#039;d be more interested in the machines that Apple Bloom&#039;s whipping up down in engineering.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gives her security officer a worried look. &quot;She&#039;s experimenting that close to the warp core?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, the chief engineer is keeping an eye on her. I don&#039;t think AJ would let Bloom do anything <i>too</i> dangerous.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain?&quot; interupts a voice.</p><p class="double">The unicorn turns to her science officer. &quot;Yes Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You may want to see this...&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;An object is approaching us at high warp velocity, warp 9.8... no, it&#039;s slowing down, decelerating to rendezvous it looks like. I wonder if they want to be friends?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s hope so, but just in case... Leiutenant Dash, bring up our shields and go to yellow alert. Passive tracking solution only. Helm, slow to sub-light and be ready for evasion pattern Perseus One.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shields, yellow alert aye aye!&quot; Rainbow tapped the two holo-panels positioned within easy wingtip reach, and an alert sound started hooting.</p><p class="double">The object on their main screen expanded into a sphere and matched their velocity with trivial ease, then expanded into a checker patterned wall. Scootaloo slowed the Ponydrive and brought her round to skim the surface to avoid crashing into it. &quot;Smartly done, Ensign! Bring us to a halt at 10000 klicks from it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain! The object has expanded over one tenth of a lightyear in every direction almost instantly. My sensors can&#039;t read the material or forcefield type. At least the pattern&#039;s pretty.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s also familiar...&quot; Twilight sighed. There was a flash, and Discord appeared in front of the main screen, wearing a zoot suit, big sunglasses and a pimp cane.</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings! I am Q, Q to my friends, but you can call me Q.&quot; He raised the glasses and stage whispered, &quot;It&#039;s actually me, Discord!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, really? Your cunning disguise totally fooled all of us.&quot; Twilight replied deadpan. &quot;So this is your basic &#039;Alien super-being with time on his manipulative appendages decides to test the puny mortals?&#039; I assume?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Discord nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well.&quot; Twilight said. &quot;All hands prepare for Ponyfleet scenario 5C.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>31.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight shelved a book quietly. &quot;You know it has to happen sometime. She&#039;ll know something is up if you don&#039;t show up when you should.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think I&#039;m ready for this. Actually, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m ready to do anything this loop, I&#039;m just going to hide out in Macintosh&#039;s bar.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s not actually Awake,&quot; the librarian pointed out with a small smile. &quot;So the bar doesn&#039;t actually exist.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...does it have to be now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not right now. But... sometime this loop, you really should talk to her.&quot; After a moment, the unicorn smiled. &quot;Celestia is awake this loop too, you know. And, after your conversation with her--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, I know, she&#039;s... not <i>her.</i>&quot; After a moment, the black pegasus let her wings droop. &quot;Alright, alright. But... you have to be there too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fair enough.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia of the Sun sipped her tea, letting her gaze drift to the pink pony on her left.</p><p class="double">Princess Mi Amore Cadenza sipped her tea, examining the diplomat across from her.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, Magic&#039;s exalt, sipped her tea and glanced toward the diplomat sympathetically.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis, Queen of the Changeling Swarm, held the teacup in her magic nervously as she sipped, unable to look at any of them.</p><p class="double">Cadance put her cup down gently. &quot;A peace accord. Based on public integration of Changelings.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...yes. That is, well, why I approached Equestria. Diplomatically.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia and Twilight said nothing, waiting for one of the other two to make the first move.</p><p class="double">Eventually the pink alicorn sighed. &quot;You&#039;re looping, aren&#039;t you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis wilted even further. &quot;...yes. I... I just want to say, I&#039;m sorry and.... and really, that about covers everything I could say.&quot; She cringed. &quot;I can understand if you hate me--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look. The invasion, baseline... yeah, it left an impact on me.&quot; Cadance shrugged. &quot;But I&#039;ve had literally thousands of loops to deal with all that emotional baggage, and so long as you don&#039;t do it again--which you&#039;re probably not going to do, seeing as you&#039;re negotiating for peace--I&#039;m perfectly willing to extend the olive branch.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen&#039;s ears perked. Twilight relaxed.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, Chrysy--can I call you Chrysy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;.&quot; Chrysalis took a breath. &quot;Ah.... I... honestly prefer you wouldn&#039;t.&quot; For some reason she was flushing furiously.</p><p class="double">&quot;...oooookay.&quot; Cadance tapped her hoof for a moment. &quot;...Anyway, how long have you been looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um.... maybe... five loops?&quot; Chrysalis nodded. &quot;Yes. Five.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. By her count there had been six loops so far for the changeling queen, but she was quick enough to recognize exactly what Chrysalis was dancing around.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Well, I hope the loops so far have been, you know, kind to you.&quot; Cadance smiled. &quot;If there&#039;s anything I can do to help your transition--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That really won&#039;t be necessary! I&#039;m coping.&quot; Chrysalis smiled, trying to meet Cadence&#039;s eyes. &quot;Princess Twilight and her friends are helping me.&quot;</p><p class="double">An eyebrow was slowly raised. &quot;<i>Princess</i> Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah....&quot; Chrysalis coughed. &quot;She... can be a princess. It&#039;s a formality, really, if you think I should drop it I can.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I&#039;m fine with it, I was just curious...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s rather understandable,&quot; Celestia pointed out, &quot;given that Twilight had to overthrow me in Chrysalis&#039;s first loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm, yes. Apparently that version of me practiced slavery--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess!&quot; Twilight snapped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I understand that you were very shaken by--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait.&quot; Cadance blinked. &quot;Are you... You were <i>awake?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence slammed down at the alicorn&#039;s shout, the queen of changelings curling up in her chair as the princess of love panted, her hooves against the table. The reigning diarch stood from her chair; her student had buried her face in her forehooves.</p><p class="double">Cadance took a deep breath.</p><p class="double">She let it out.</p><p class="double">She took another breath, sitting back down. Slowly, Celestia retook her own seat, though her eyes never left the other alicorn.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Cadance composed herself. &quot;So. You were... awake for that loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked up, briefly. Twilight reached out and patted her shoulder.</p><p class="double">&quot;...yes. I...&quot; The changeling gulped. &quot;I... thought the whole, baseline loop was... a bad dream.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Cadance sighed and shook her head. &quot;Alright. Okay, I... I can see where you&#039;d be coming from. And I can&#039;t really blame you for Shining, there, that..... I just... argh.&quot; She rubbed her temples, her eyes screwed tightly. &quot;Did you know how I felt? Every time I looked at you two, I remembered the baseline and.... and I had to remind myself constantly that wasn&#039;t what was going on, that you hadn&#039;t actually stolen him--&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia looked between them, somewhat confused. &quot;Wait, what are you two talking about?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;In... that loop, Shining wasn&#039;t awake, he helped Chrysalis run an underground railroad... they fell in love...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I did sense those emotions from you,&quot; Chrysalis explained awkwardly. &quot;I... just thought it was a natural thing. You know, Alicorn of love, I eat love... I was actually very impressed with how you repressed your bigotry.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Except it wasn&#039;t bigotry, was it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not... well, maybe a little. But not really.&quot; Cadance sighed. &quot;Resentment, more like... and I could see you two were genuinely in love and... Ugh. This is just... Look, can we start over here? I don&#039;t, well... I&#039;m not sure how to feel about this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia brought her hoof to her forehead gently. &quot;Twilight... why didn&#039;t you mention this before?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It kind of ties in to why I never mentioned that loop at all,&quot; the unicorn offered, rubbing the back of her head. &quot;I mean, this whole situation is weird...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You really don&#039;t know how to feel, do you?&quot; Chrysalis tilted her head. &quot;There&#039;s flashes of anger and pity and... I... Um. Sure. Starting over sounds good...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, very good. So! I&#039;m Cadance, and... it&#039;s nice to meet you, I guess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Chrysalis and... I... am happy that you&#039;re happy to meet me...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia took a breath. &quot;Well, at least this ended up being peaceful enough. Maybe we should arrange for Shining Armor to--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; Chrysalis cried. &quot;No. I am not... <i>nearly</i> ready enough to handle that. No. Can we not tell him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess,&quot; Twilight replied with a shrug. &quot;He&#039;s not Awake anyway...&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen perked her ears. &quot;He... isn&#039;t?&quot; She turned to Cadance with an awkward smile. &quot;Um, would you mind terribly if--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re dating,&quot; the alicorn replied flatly.</p><p class="double">&quot;...ah. Oh, um. Okay...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance let out an annoyed grumble. &quot;This would be so much easier if I could actually hate you...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So... that went well!&quot; Twilight chirped brightly. &quot;I mean, all things considered.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis gave her a long, flat look.</p><p class="double">Then, after a moment, green flames burst up around her and she smiled. &quot;I&#039;ll go give Macintosh your love.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What--&quot; The unicorn blinked as she rushed out of the library. &quot;Chrysalis!&quot; Twilight ran after her double, trying to catch her before she made the loop more embaressing then it was, but already Chrysalis was nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um, Twilight?&quot; Fluttershy walked up timidly. &quot;Hello. What is, um, how are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quick, Shy, did you see me run through here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Well yes. Chrysalis went that way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, you&#039;re the--Wait, Shy&#039;s not awake this loop.&quot; Twilight turned to her friend and raised an eyebrow. &quot;Haha, very funny. You got me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy rolled her eyes and burst into flames, turning into a black pegasus. &quot;You&#039;re really too smart for your own good, Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, in all seriousness... it could have gone a lot worse.&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;I think this is good though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That whole thing was incredibly awkward.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not nearly as awkward as the time I killed Cadance and married Shining. Man, when she got back from the dead things were weird...&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. &quot;I... <i>what?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and snorted. &quot;Okay, so my preawake self was basically a sociopath in that loop, and the local Pinkie Pie somehow managed to bake a portal to the afterlife--no, I don&#039;t understand it either...&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p>31.4 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Academic Excellence - Epilogue</u></p><p class="double">Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash entered the Commandants office to find Spitfire already there. The two of them had rested up (much to Pinkie Pie&#039;s disappointment until Twilight reminded her that they still had the party to set up for later) and had received orders to report as soon as they&#039;d recovered. The yellow pegasus looked at them over her glasses as they came to attention in front of her.</p><p class="double">“Well. I have to say, when you bust clouds, you don&#039;t do half a job! You will be pleased to know that your entire group will be receiving commendations on their records, and the Silver Bolt, for actions above and beyond the call of duty.”</p><p class="double">The two pegasi couldn&#039;t help cracking at least a small grin. It wasn&#039;t the highest award the Wonderbolts could bestow, but it was respectable. Full fledged Wonderbolts had gone through their careers without getting it, and the number of cadets that had received it could be counted on one hoof, without the hoof.</p><p class="double">“However, the two of you require special attention. As the highest scoring wing pair in the group, you were its de-facto leaders, and that&#039;s borne out by my interviews with the other cadets. They followed your lead on this. That&#039;s why I&#039;m trying to decide whether to have you commended to the Princesses for bravery, or to kick you off the cloud for doing something so reckless!”</p><p class="double">The sudden change in tone caught both of them by surprise.</p><p class="double">“The Wonderbolts have their own records which I&#039;ve studied since we returned. The last time a Tempest emerged from the Everfree Forest, it was driven off from an attack on Cloudsdale, not destroyed, and doing so required the combined efforts of the Wonderbolts and the Cloudsdale Royal Guard contingent. Not without casualties either.</p><p class="double">“Cadet Dash, you apparently knew about this thing&#039;s capabilities. What in Equestria possessed you to attack it, and risk yourself and the other cadets?”</p><p class="double">“Ma&#039;am, we didn&#039;t start out intending to attack it. We received the distress call from Twilight, and set out to rescue her balloon. I explained what I knew, and all the other cadets agreed to the risk. But the initial plan was purely to distract it, play keep away to distract it while we got the balloon out of there then disengage.”</p><p class="double">“All the same, you put the other cadets in considerable danger.” Spitfire said sternly.</p><p class="double">“Permission to speak ma&#039;am!” Lightning Dust piped up.</p><p class="double">“Yes cadet?”</p><p class="double">“The information may have come from Dash, and the plan was developed by all of our group working together, but Dash looked to me for the final say go ahead. I&#039;m the Lead pony of the leading wing pair, which means it was my call. I gave the okay, so if there&#039;s trouble coming, it&#039;s my responsibility, not Dash&#039;s.”</p><p class="double">Dash couldn&#039;t help but look side-long at her lead in surprise. Then she felt bad for being surprised . Lightning Dust might have flaws, but lack of courage wasn&#039;t one of them. She wouldn&#039;t leave her friend hanging. “But it was my advice you followed. We went into that storm cloud together, you&#039;re not going into this one alone.”</p><p class="double">“Attention!” The two snapped back to attention to look forward at Spitfire., who took her sun glasses off and folded them deliberately.</p><p class="double">“Much as I enjoy watching the two of you play the reverse blame game, I will decide who is responsible for what, and what should be done about it. Rescuing civilians, I don&#039;t have a problem with. But you still have to explain why once they were out of danger, you didn&#039;t disengage. You correctly alerted the Officer on Deck, you must have known we we&#039;d scramble everything we had to come support you.”</p><p class="double">The two ponies glanced at each other, and Lightning Dust gave a slight nod, which Dash took to be a sign to take the question. “It was firing bolts of lightning ma&#039;am, not just short bursts but long streaks that homed in, but it could only track so fast. Close in, we could evade them, but if we&#039;d increased the range, we or one of the other wing pairs would have gotten hit.</p><p class="double">“We were trapped. That was my fault, I didn&#039;t know it could do that, but having seen it up close, sensed how the weather magic inside it held it together, I realised a large enough burst of weather magic to it&#039;s core could break it apart. But it took both of us to deliver enough energy to finish the job. I know it wasn&#039;t a good option, but at that point we didn&#039;t <i>have</i> any good options. At the very least, the disruption would have allowed the other wing pairs to get clear.”</p><p class="double">“And you agreed to this plan?” Spitfire looked over at Lightning Dust.</p><p class="double">“Yes ma&#039;am! Rainbow Dash is a skilled weather pony, and the only pony in Equestria able to do a Sonic Rainboom...”</p><p class="double">“Not any more.” Dash whispered, then shut up at a quelling glare from Spitfire.</p><p class="double">“... more than that, I trust her judgement. If she believed it had a good chance of success, I wasn&#039;t going to disagree. In truth she deserves to be Lead pony far more than I do. The entire group from Ponyville already works together like a Wonderbolt team, has blown away every group record they&#039;ve gone up against and she&#039;s never been anything less than supportive of any of them.</p><p class="double">“She even managed to get me turned around. I was heading for a bad place, but she never gave up on me, no matter what I did. She might risk herself, but she would never risk her team mates, or ask them to do anything she wouldn&#039;t do herself. With respect ma&#039;am, she showed me what being a Wonderbolt actually means, and if we do get kicked off the cloud, I can think of no finer company to be in as we fall.”</p><p class="double">Spitfire stared at them both for a long moment, then heaved a big sigh. “Very well, if that is your decision... Lightning Dust!”</p><p class="double">“Yes ma&#039;am!” The green pegasus straightened up waiting for the thunderbolt to hit.</p><p class="double">“As Lead pony of your cadet group, you will be awarded the Golden Bolt for Valour and you will be commended to the Princesses. If I don&#039;t get you a Monarchs Thanks out of it, I&#039;ll go back to crop-dusting. Not just for dealing with the Tempest either. A true leader takes responsibility, and in your defence of Rainbow Dash you showed moral courage to equal your demonstrated physical bravery. You are also promoted to the rank of Cadet Leader.”</p><p class="double">That rank was only ever given to cadets who came back for advanced training, and then only to a senior cadet who was in charge of a junior group. She broke into a wide grin at the thunderstruck expression on Lightning Dust&#039;s face. “However, if you ever pull a stunt like that again without orders I will pin your wings back so far you can clean your pinions with your tail! Do you read me Cadet Leader?”</p><p class="double">“Ma&#039;am, yes ma&#039;am!” Lightning Dust saluted so hard, she almost brained herself with her hoof. She glanced at Dash to see how she was taking it and saw only a wide grin as the rainbow pegasus reverse punched the air.</p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash, the position of Cadet Leader is already taken, however, I intend to see you wearing a Golden Bolt, though my sources tell me I don&#039;t need to commend you to the princesses. I do however have a position in mind, Assistant instructor Dash, if you&#039;re willing to accept it.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s wings almost lifted her off the ground. “Woo hoo... I mean, ma&#039;am yes ma&#039;am! I do ma&#039;am!”</p><p class="double">Spitfire polished a lens against her lapel and put her glasses back on. “Considering the job you&#039;ve done up till now, I figured why not make it official? Now, I believe you have a party to go to. Dismissed!”</p><p class="double">The two of them saluted again, and filed out. Dash hesitated in the door for a moment, looking back at the seated pony, silhouetted by the setting sun coming through the windows behind her.</p><p class="double">“Um... ma&#039;am?”</p><p class="double">“What is it Rainbow Dash?” Spitfire&#039;s response was short, but not unkind.</p><p class="double">“Would you like to join us? When you come off duty that is. There&#039;s going to be plenty of food for every-pony, and Applejack&#039;s only gotten better at baking since the Gala.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was as easy to read as a Wonderbolts promotional poster and for that Spitfire was glad. This wasn&#039;t an attempt to curry favour, though what more could she want? It was nothing more than a genuine offer for Spitfire to come and enjoy herself.</p><p class="double">“I have a lot of paperwork to do... but I&#039;ll make my way over as soon as it&#039;s finished.” She pulled the first report from a stack, running the Academy wasn&#039;t all hoof-printing autograph pictures, and sighed. “Thank the Princesses I&#039;m rotating back to operational duty next month. The paperwork only ever seems to stack higher.”</p><p class="double">“I hear you ma&#039;am. Cloud use reports, thunderstorm health and safety assessments, an earth pony could haul the water to Cloudsdale just by stacking up the weather patrol paperwork and climbing it.”</p><p class="double">“Go on!” Spitfire waved her away. “Go have fun, you&#039;ve earned it. Maybe when I get there you can show me how to do that Sonic Rainboom of yours. This chassis may not be the latest model, but I can still buck the blue with the best of them. And maybe this old pony can teach the two of you some new tricks.”</p><p class="double">“Ma&#039;am yes ma&#039;am!” With that Rainbow Dash closed the door behind her.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">The party had run well in to the twilight, and Twilight was well into running the party. Firefly tiki torches were scattered around the cloud it was being held on, and the Pinkie/Applejack buffet was being done great justice by the assembled ponies. Pinkie herself was part of the group playing cloud volleyball over to one side and a number of other ponies were just chilling with drinks and listening to a Victrola which was pumping out &#039;Good Striations&#039; by the Cumulus Colts. </p><p class="double">(Yes, it is your typical surfer beach party.)</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust and Rainbow dash were at the centre of this group, at least until they saw Spitfire approaching. Rainbow Dash greeted her with a grin and a wide wave of her wing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome to the party!&quot;</p><p class="double">Lightning Dust was a little more thoughtful. &quot;Uh ma&#039;am? Permission to speak freely?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spitfire gave a grin of her own. &quot;We&#039;re off the clock, so you can cut down the ma&#039;aming to a minimum &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The meeting, the whole getting kicked out, was it all a test?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Life is a test, and there&#039;s no retakes.&quot; </p><p class="double">Spitfire thought she heard a muffled snort from Rainbow Dash, and wondered what was so funny.</p><p class="double">She continued. &quot;In short, yes and no. I needed to understand not just what you did, but why. I knew you had courage, but did it make you reckless? In a regular Wonderbolt, a willingness to take risks isn&#039;t necessarily a flaw, if they&#039;re able to follow the chain of command, harness it to the overall plan, but a leader has to have something more. the ability to assess the risks, make the decisions as to whether they&#039;re worthwhile, balance the needs of the team with the needs of the mission, and put both ahead of their own needs.&quot;</p><p class="double">She tapped the younger pegasus on the chest. &quot;You demonstrated just that in the way you responded when I made the meeting adversarial. You got the good stuff because you exceeded my expectations once again. You&#039;re going to make one heck of a Wonderbolt, and that goes for you too, you grinning maverick!&quot;</p><p class="double">The last was addressed to the smirking Rainbow Dash. &quot;Okay, now if Soarin hasn&#039;t finished them off, I&#039;d like to get some of those pies, and then we&#039;ll see if I can buck out a Sonic Rainboom.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;So, um, Mom...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled to herself, still feeling her heart warm up a bit even after all these years. Then she turned around. &quot;Yes Nyx?&quot;</p><p class="double">The young black alicorn shuffled her hoof around in a slow circle. &quot;You know how, um... in my original loop, there was the whole Cult of Nightmare thing?&quot;</p><p class="double">The scholar nodded, wondering exactly where this was going.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... I just found out there&#039;s a <i>small</i> cult here too... but, um...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....but?&quot; Twilight prompted gently.</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re not... exactly... competent. Or sane, actually.&quot; Nyx shrugged. &quot;They&#039;ve got a clown, two other ponies... I&#039;m pretty sure one of them is a stoner, but I can&#039;t figure out which one. Oh, and their leader does manage the whole Evil Minion thing. That&#039;s actually all he does.&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian blinked. After a moment she nodded once. &quot;Okay, so you have some... strange fans. It&#039;s happened to all of us, Nyx, and if you ever need to talk about it--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, um...&quot; The reborn incarnation of Nightmare Moon, Embodiment of Eternal Night and Tyrant Usurper, let her eyes fall to the ground awkwardly. &quot;I kinda... sorta... maybe invited them over for dinner tonight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They were genuflecting! I panicked!&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Spike shared a look as the pie dripped slowly down the librarian&#039;s mane.</p><p class="double">It had turned out that Nyx had missed two members of the cult, resulting in a mad kitchen scramble to redistribute the portions while Twilight got to know her daughter&#039;s... stalkers, to be totally honest. Clippy Clop the clown was apparently mute, but made up for it with humorous japery... of which Twilight was a victim. He was probably only in the cult because of Screwball, who had ended up being the town fool in this loop instead of Diamond Tiara&#039;s mad sister... or mother.... or Discord&#039;s daughter, thank Celestia the chaos god wasn&#039;t awake <i>that</i> loop.</p><p class="double">A yellow stallion sighed and levitated the pipan off their host. &quot;I&#039;m... sorry about him, he takes his job seriously.&quot; He smiled apologetically, further cementing his status in her mind as the sane member of this group.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s fine mister Cosmic.&quot; Twilight shook her head, dislodging some of the cream as she levitated a towel out of the kitchen. &quot;I&#039;ve had worse, and I&#039;m sure mister Clop was only expressing his appreciation for my delicate care of your deity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed, bro, that&#039;s an awesome thing you&#039;re doing. Awesome like the wave I totes saw in my cereal this morning.&quot; The white pegasus mare stretched her wings. &quot;Like... whoa..&quot;</p><p class="double">Apparently Sunny Daze was an actual pegasus this loop, instead of just an alias, and Twilight couldn&#039;t exactly fault Nyx for thinking she was high; the surfer tone made sense, but the observations she made were rather... unusual. She&#039;d almost blown cover by accidentally calling her princess, but Sunny had assumed that Twilight was just referring to her position as the most radical of Nightmare Moon&#039;s followers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, miss Daze.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa, dude, miss Daze is my <i>mother.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Screwball screwed up her face. &quot;I thought your mother&#039;s name was Whipcurl?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus rolled her eyes. &quot;Totes being metaphor, dudette.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why is she a dudette when I&#039;m a dude?&quot; Twilight asked lightly. &quot;We&#039;re both mares!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa. You&#039;re a dudette?&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian blinked. After a moment, she took a breath and turned to the other pegasus in the room. &quot;So... um... Rocken Coconut. Those are some interesting colors you&#039;ve painted yourself...&quot;</p><p class="double">Coconut preened, brushing a black hoof through his mane and obliviously pulling some of the dried blue paint out of its blonde strands. &quot;Thank you. I felt it was only natural for me to emulate the Goddess&#039;s form. Of course I&#039;d never wear my horn in public, that would be blasphemous.&quot; Clippy Clop honked solemnly.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded slowly. &quot;That... makes sense.&quot; After a moment, she took a breath and turned to the final stallion. &quot;You&#039;ve been very quiet, mister...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tiiiiireeeeeeeeek.&quot; The whispered growl emerged slowly from the dark shadows of the hood. &quot;Bringer of tooooooormeeeent and looooooooyal servitor to her high empressssssss. I see no reeeeeeeessssson to speak to you.&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian rolled her eyes. &quot;Whatever you say. If you&#039;ll excuse me, I need to check on dinner....&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.6</p><p class="double">“Look, Dash,” Gilda said, “I don’t get why you’re so uptight about this. You were never this boring in Flight School.”</p><p class="double">Dash winced internally. It was tough, dealing with Gilda. Half the time she was reminding Dash of how much they’d been friends, and the other half the time she was being kind of a jerk.</p><p class="double">Yes, Dash could engineer a reconciliation or at least a less firey breakup, and stay in touch. But doing it over and over again got kind of wearying after a while.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy’s my friend, too, Gils,” Dash replied. “I mean, she’s… yeah, different, but…”</p><p class="double">“Heh.” Gilda looked down. “Different, yeah. Hey, watch this!”</p><p class="double">“Wait-” Dash was speaking to an empty cloud.</p><p><hr></p><p>Gilda landed just around the corner from where Fluttershy was, then walked out acting oblivious. It didn’t take long for the two of them to bump into one another.</p><p class="double">“Oi!” Gilda shouted, and roared at Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">The great noise sent ponies all around the area scurrying for cover.</p><p class="double">When it ended, Fluttershy cocked her head. “Are we having a roaring contest?” she asked, politely.</p><p class="double">“…eh?” The griffin blinked.</p><p class="double">“My turn.”</p><p class="double">Abruptly, there was a large wolf standing there instead. It threw back its neck, and howled to the sky at the top of its lungs. It went on, and on, for at least thirty seconds.</p><p class="double">When done, the wolf looked down, then blushed… somehow. “Oh, sorry…” Fluttershy said, transforming back and rubbing her hooves together, “…that wasn’t a roar, was it? I suppose you win…”</p><p class="double">Gilda breathed deeply, forcing her raised hackles to go down. Once she had them under control, she preened her wings a bit, then dropped the task until later. “What the buck just happened?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy just looked down and shuffled her hooves.</p><p class="double">For her part, Gilda looked conflicted. “…I mean, I didn’t imagine that, right? You just turned into a wolf?”</p><p class="double">“…yes…”</p><p class="double">“You know…” Gilda’s expression firmed. “That was actually pretty cool.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Some of the strength came back into Fluttershy’s voice.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.”</p><p><hr></p><p>From her cloud, Dash thought over how to take that.</p><p class="double">Apparently griffins <i>did</i> respect strength. Cool.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.7</p><p class="double">“Basically,” Twilight said, looking at Chrysalis over a pair of spectacles, “I think it would help you to move on a bit.”</p><p class="double">The Changeling Queen looked less than convinced. “I don’t know if it would. Or, for that matter, if that would be a good idea in the first place.”</p><p class="double">Then she pointed. “And what’s with the spectacles, anyway?”</p><p class="double">“I dunno,” Twilight replied, shrugging. “I found them in the library once, and they seemed to be a good thing to keep around. I’m thinking of getting them rose tinted. But back to my point. You can’t just pine over Shining forever – that’s not fair to yourself, it’s not fair to him, and it’s not fair to Cadence either.”</p><p class="double">“I know it isn’t,” Chrysalis replied. “But he’s still… he <i>was</i> still… my first real <i>love</i>. Up to then, love wasn’t something I fully understood, I think. It wasn’t the way the hive works – that’s an intense affection, but it’s like… a limb. Or something. You’re just so used to it being there that you have to take a step back to notice it. But Shining… it was something I <i>wasn’t</i> used to, and it was… wonderful.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I see. And I do have sympathy for you – the way you put it sounds a lot like how I first got friends. But… you don’t need to have just one love. Ponies move on from their first loves, and it doesn’t make the second any less sweet.”</p><p class="double">“And you’d know?” Chrysalis challenged.</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Twilight replied. “Not directly. But I’ve paid attention to how all this works.”</p><p class="double">After a moment, she pulled a scrapbook from her subspace pocket and turned to a double-page spread, full of photographs. “See this human?”</p><p class="double">“Yes…” Chrysalis replied, confused by the non-sequitur.</p><p class="double">“His name is Bran. I Looped here once, and… oh, never mind, it’d take too long to explain. But Bran’s a werewolf, one of several there. That’s his second wife.”</p><p class="double">“And he loves her?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked at her in astonishment.</p><p class="double">“He lost his first wife, and it hurt too much, so he deliberately picked as his second mate – and wife – someone who was too petty, too judgemental, to become part of his heart.” Twilight closed the scrapbook again. “That’s an option, too, but I really think you’re not the sort of pony to take it.”</p><p class="double">After a long minute of thought, the changeling nodded slowly.</p><p class="double">“On a completely different tack, though, you don’t <i>need</i> to find a special somepony straight away if you <i>do</i> decide to follow my advice. In fact, I’d advise against it.” Twilight shrugged. “Spike and Rarity are an extreme case – they spent over a hundred years getting to know one another again before they made it official – but the idea is sound. Don’t commit too soon, at least if you’re going to do more than what Bran did.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, then.” Chrysalis nodded to herself. “I’ll give it a go.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“So…” the disguised Changeling said awkwardly, shifting on the chair as her pegasus’ wings tried to flare in nervousness. “What do you do, then?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I give self help seminars, actually,” Iron Will replied, pouring them both drinks. “All about being tough and courageous. Very gryphonic philosophy, in a way.”</p><p class="double">“That’s interesting…” Chrysalis said, and then nearly got bowled over by a sudden rush of vehement, forthright emotion.</p><p class="double">“Don’t be half hearted! If someone’s being square, give them a nasty stare!”</p><p class="double"><i>Somehow,</i> Chrysalis thought, <i>this isn’t going to work out.</i></p><p><hr></p><p>31.8</p><p class="double">Twilight felt the Loop settling into place around her in a familiar way. Canterlot, just found out about Nightmare Moon, all that jazz.</p><p class="double">“Okay, Spike, take a-”…</p><p class="double">Something was wrong.</p><p class="double">“I… think you might have confused me with someone else,” a decidedly <i>female</i> voice said from behind her.</p><p class="double">Twilight scanned through her loop memories as she turned to the speaker. As it happened, she was a <i>blue</i> baby dragon.</p><p class="double">“…oh, hold on,” Twilight said, interested. “Are you a new Looper?”</p><p class="double">“Well, new to here. Hi, I’m-”</p><p class="double">“Saphira, yes,” Twilight nodded. The dragon seemed slightly surprised, and Twilight tossed her mane. “Loop memories tend to support a self-consistent reality, and since you’re taking the place of my assistant, Spike… that means I know your name.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, of course.” Saphira nodded. “I’m sorry, we’re not very used to fused loops. I think this is only the third or the fourth…”</p><p class="double">“Right. Oh, are you the Anchor?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Saphira paused. “Well, mostly no. My bonded human is, and we have a fairly close empathic bond, so we’re hardly ever <i>not</i> both Looping.”</p><p class="double">“Interesting…” Twilight dashed off a note with magic while she spoke. “Well, we’ll see how the first few days of the Loop go, and see if your Anchor is around.”</p><p class="double">Saphira held up a hand-paw. “No need, my link just started working. He’s here. And apparently a… lacemaker. Well, at least he’s good at that.” The little dragon carefully hid a good-natured chuckle.</p><p class="double">“…well, that answers the question of who <i>he’s</i> replacing,” Twilight said.</p><p><hr></p><p>The anchor in question, Eragon, sank back onto a couch in the library. Saphira walked over and sat next to him, and they exchanged a fond look before turning to Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Basically, where we come from, there’s this huge empire, then some elves, and rebels.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“My Loop starts right about when the elves try to send a dragon egg –“</p><p class="double">“That’s me,” Saphira said.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that’s Saphira, to someone who works for the rebels.” Eragon looked at Twilight with a sardonic expression. “I’m simplifying just a bit, in case you couldn’t tell. Anyway, I pick it up, then miss Blue Scales here hatches out and things get a bit… complicated.”</p><p class="double">“Complicated meaning,” Saphira said with a tart smile, “he and I become the single most valuable bargaining chip in Alagaesia. Dragon riders were the old rulers where we come from, so old Slow Feet here and I are champions and legitimizers all rolled into one – and it didn’t help that we were both breathtakingly naïve, politically, the first time. Add to <i>that</i> that I’m the only female dragon that entire world knows exists, and…”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced.</p><p class="double">“So, long story short, we’re looking forward to a loop as quiet as we can get.”</p><p class="double">“Right…” Twilight nodded. “Good news for you there, actually. Princess Celestia and Princess Luna declared Equestria’s Loop to be a sanctuary. You can have your quiet loop.” Then she paused. “By the way… what’s with the lace?”</p><p class="double">Eragon shot a glance at Saphira, who held up her hand-paws. “Guilty, guilty, I accept full responsibility.”</p><p class="double">“You’ll pay for that,” he warned, and she grinned. “Anyway, it’s actually how we fund the Varden – that’s the rebel group. Magic is costly of energy, more costly than doing the same thing by non-magical means, but it’s perfect for finicky detail work.”</p><p class="double">“So you work for the rebels?”</p><p class="double">“Sometimes.” He stretched his forelegs out on the couch. “Sometimes I try the Empire, sometimes the Elves, sometimes I go my own way. It’s a right bear trying to make my world actually work out.”</p><p><hr></p><p>“Well…” Spike said, looking down. “I didn’t expect this.”</p><p class="double">The alabaster dragon about the size of a small cat gave a wing-flipping shrug in response.</p><p class="double">“Hey, join the club,” Hiccup said. “I get about one loop in fifty where I’m the dragon, these days.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Spike snapped his fingers, summoning his lightsaber. “Well, I might need <i>this</i>… anyway, where’s Toothless?”</p><p class="double">“Officially, he’s dead. Unofficially…” Hiccup opened his jacket, revealing a six-inch fire lizard hanging from the inner lining.</p><p class="double"><i>Hey,</i> Toothless broadcast on a broad band. <i>You wanna buy a dragon?</i> </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">31.9 (misterQ)</p><p><hr></p><p>&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I reckon I do,&quot; said a despondent looking Applejack. She looked over at Twilight Sparkle, only to see that her friend was already in therapist mode. Every pony who was awake this loop decided to take this round off and go on vacation. Celestia was teaching her sister and Nyx how to surf. Most of her friends were enjoying themselves on the beach, along with Derpy and her daughters - who Applejack remembered should have also been in Ponyville at the same time. Of course, she remembered having seen Derpy at the young flyer&#039;s competition in three different places at the same time. Applejack just silently filed this fact away in her mental vault along with the memories of all of the non-euclidean mind-warping things she had encountered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why don&#039;t you start at the beginning of that loop, Applejack,&quot; Twilight said as she sat in her beach chair, &quot;I assume you mean the one where Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and myself went off to help a non-looping Spike with his dragon curiosity issues?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, that&#039;s the one,&quot; Applejack sipped from her large mug of cider and wondered if she&#039;d need anything stronger to tell the tale, &quot;I mean, things started off like they all happened originally. Then Princess Celestia called on me and Pinkie and Trixie, of all ponies, to help her deal with an issue.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is strange she would call on Trixie…&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Princess told us it was because we needed a unicorn, and you and Rarity were gone at the time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight contemplated that for a short while, &quot;Still, it seems odd that she would need Pinkie and Trixie, of all ponies, to accompany you on what was supposed to be a diplomatic mission.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed, &quot;That&#039;s because I reckon our princess has days where she done dumps a bunch of fuel on the fire to see how big the flames are going to get. And that&#039;s all fine and good unless the flames are suddenly consuming all the rational parts of my mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight sighed. She was very, very well antiquated with the mischievous side of Celestia. She looked over to see the grinning sun princess telekinetically pulled the surfboard out from under Luna, plunging her sister into the water and chastising her about keeping her balance, &quot;So.... seaponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack gave a small shudder and acknowledged, &quot;Yup. Seaponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">The was a long silence as the orange earth pony took a long sip of her cider, &quot;The first thing you gotta know about seaponies and mermares is that they&#039;re all insane. All the ponies under the water are completely crazy. Pinkie Pie said that they&#039;ve been battling undersea horrors for so long, they&#039;re on their last sanity point; whatever that means.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Pinkie was sent with you on a diplomatic mission to Aquastria?&quot; Twilight blinked, astounded, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">In answer, Applejack just pointed her hoof at the epic water fight erupting between the two alicorn sisters. Then she continued, &quot;Although it may be because Pinkie was the closest to their way of thinking. Anyways, Trixie cast the &#039;don&#039;t drown and die&#039;, or whatever it&#039;s called, spell on all of us and down we went.&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony took another sip from her mug, remembering, &quot;Do you know why King Leo is a seal?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sea Lion,&quot; Twilight Sparkle corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seal, sea lion; what&#039;s the difference?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Longer whiskers, longer flippers, and ear flaps to start with. Seals only have little ear holes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ear flaps? Seriously?&quot; Applejack sighed, &quot;Anyways, do you know why King Leo isn&#039;t a seapony? It&#039;s because someone rational has to be able to keep them all from blowing everything up or setting everything on fire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her mouth, but Applejack interrupted, &quot;And yes, I know that they live underwater. But trust me on this. Setting themselves and everything else on fire is a very real danger with unmonitored seaponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn debated with herself before asking, &quot;How?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The first thing you got to realize is that seaponies are all water-benders. For a people with no real limbs and only a tail, they are scary powerful. You&#039;d think you&#039;d be safe on land, but I&#039;ve seen them create water spheres around them and roll right on after their enemies. Then they can create water tendrils that can happily rip apart a lava demon and beat them to death with their own severed body parts while the seaponies all laugh and sing and harmonize.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That all actually happened, by the way,&quot; Applejack clarified, &quot;While the mermares and the seastallions had their annual no-holds-barred race, some lava demons all done decided to attack. The reason the actual seapony leader who - doesn&#039;t like ruling, and thank the herd for that; Queen Marina called for Equestrian help was to try to convince King Leo to open up their strategic reserves of both explosives and cheerleading outfits to fight the encroaching forces of the Squirk, the Kraken King.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheerleading outfits?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t rightly know. Only that it mightily disturbed King Leo to see Pinkie Pie when she found one. Then he called her over and whispered something to her about Squirk, and she quickly got out of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. see,&quot; And Twilight really, really wished she didn&#039;t; so she changed the subject, &quot;I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever met this Queen Marina.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s usually on the front lines, fighting them undersea monstrosities that Pinkie talked about. Elegant mermare, pretty tail and fins, but she gets a really scary grin on her face when she&#039;s all talking about explosives. She and Trixie got on like apples and more apples.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When Pinkie and I got back from baking our contribution to the victory feast, Pinkie latched on to the conversation about things that go all boom,&quot; Applejack finished off her cider in one long sip, &quot;They started resonating crazy, Twilight. The three of them, Trixie, Pinkie, and Marina, started scaring me real bad. I pulled them apart when I started hearing phrases like &#039;willy pete fiendfyre variant&#039;, &#039;everything explodes forever&#039;, and &#039;how difficult would it be to summon a chlorine trifluoride elemental underwater&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Applejack. Just enjoy this vacation loop, okay?&quot; Twilight gently hugged her distraught friend, &quot;Just do me one favor, alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What is that?&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn smiled, &quot;Don&#039;t go in the water.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack returned the grin, &quot;You don&#039;t have to tell me twice, sugarcube.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>32.1</p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Trixie said, in an urgent whisper. “I have something to show you.”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Twilight asked, looking up.</p><p class="double">“Sssh!” Trixie replied in a strangled tone. “Not so loud!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, you have my attention…” Twilight put her book down, with bookmark, and followed her friend out to Trixie’s wagon slash shed.</p><p class="double">(Trixie insisted it was still a wagon, but Twilight had her own opinions about something which had no wheels and was held down by guy ropes. And which had three extra rooms, including a bathroom and Jacuzzi.)</p><p class="double">Once inside, Trixie pulled up a hatch in the floor and trotted slowly down the steps. Twilight followed, already wondering by what possible means it was still a wagon when it had a basement.</p><p class="double">“In here,” Trixie said, hushed, opening a large metal door which turned out to be four inches thick.</p><p class="double">“What are you <i>doing</i> down here?” Twilight asked, still quietly.</p><p class="double">“Behold,” Trixie said, and made a grand gesture. “My laboratory. I am currently working on the most impressive purely non-magical pyrotechnics I can discover. Mere unavailability of magic will not stop me from making a loop exciting.”</p><p class="double">“And what you’ve created is?” Twilight pressed, with a sinking feeling.</p><p class="double">“Dimercuric tetraazide.”</p><p class="double">There was a pause, as the scholarly Anchor digested that for a moment.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that sounds like the most obscenely touchy explosive I’ve been fortunate enough to never encounter in my long life. Is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well… yes, actually,” Trixie admitted.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Before going any further, Twilight silently cast her brother’s defensive spell on both of them. “So, what did you want to invite me down here to see?”</p><p class="double">“The bit where I decant it, of course,” Trixie replied. “It took eight months to purify enough to make a small supply, and this is a historic moment. I have genuinely discovered something new, here…”</p><p class="double">Twilight strengthened the spell.</p><p class="double">Trixie moved over to the beaker. In slow, reverent, and very careful movements, she lifted it up in both forehooves and tilted it. Liquid dripped out, one carefully metered drop at a time, until some small crystals could be seen.</p><p class="double">Again moving with the utmost care, Trixie placed the beaker back down again. She telekinetically picked up a spatula-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike blinked, as the windows rattled and he saw the Books and Branches shoot into the sky on a trail of fire. “Hey, Rarity?”</p><p class="double">“What?” the fashionista mumbled around her mouthful of pins.</p><p class="double">“I think Trixie just blew up our house again. Can I stay here?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, if you must…”</p><p class="double">They exchanged a wry look.</p><p class="double">“Any excuse is a good excuse,” Spike shrugged. “How’s it going?”</p><p class="double">“I really need to invent a fabric that changes sizes properly,” Rarity finally replied, putting the pins down. “But if you don’t size-shift with it on, those should last you a while.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Trixie would like fries with that,” the blue unicorn muttered, and fell over.</p><p class="double">Twilight dug herself out of the remains of the antechamber. “What the buck just happened?”</p><p class="double">From her position on the floor, Trixie stuck up a hoof. “I know, miss! The compound turned out to be highly reactive to even very dim light in the dry state, so even simple magiluminescence caused a violent explosion.”</p><p class="double">Splinters and bits of wagon, tree and Jacuzzi began to rain down around them.</p><p class="double">“Hi!” Derpy said, flying over the hole. “Letter for you, Twilight. Oh, were you and Trixie doing home renovation? That always happens when I try.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “No… this was more along the lines of an industrial accident.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Derpy nodded and flew off, almost tripping over in the air and hence being missed by Twilight’s still-intact bed as it plummeted into the hole next to them.</p><p class="double">“You know,” Twilight added conversationally, as she opened the letter, “if this explosion blew up the books despite my protective spells there’ll be Tartarus to pay, Trixie… oh, that’s nice. It seems my application to visit the Griffin Lands got approved.”</p><p class="double">Twilight fixed the showmare with a stare. “And my house better be here when I get back. Understand?”</p><p class="double">Trixie had started snoring.</p><p class="double">“Oh, whatever.” Twilight shrugged, then teleported out of the crater where her house used to be and trotted off east.</p><p class="double">Maybe it was time to stage an intervention with that mare…</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.2</p><p class="double">Twilight was still unsettled by that “Astrid” pegasus. From what she’d said, it had taken not too long to work out that the foreign Looper was actually one of Hiccup’s friends. (Honestly, the dragon should have been a clue.)</p><p class="double">Indeed, there were those suggestions that she thought rather more of him… though given what she was like, Twilight felt more pity than anything.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” she said, a slight quaver in her voice as Astrid flipped a battleaxe between her wings, “the next thing that normally happens here is that Fluttershy tries to redeem Discord.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>him,”</i> Astrid said, scowling.</p><p class="double">Actually, it had been fascinating to watch her interaction with Discord. He’d turned her into a cringing, zero-confidence weakling who was scared stiff by bad language and had to be rescued out from under her axe.</p><p class="double">In other words, basically into Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">“Think you could give it a go?” Twilight hazarded, and was rewarded with a scowl.</p><p class="double">“Can I, hel! I’ll sort him out.” Astrid’s face set. “Hold on, I need to go get some helpers.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You actually released me?” Discord said, looking around. “How strange.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I’ll handle this,” Astrid said, and strode forward. “Look, goatface. You listen to me, and we’re all happy fun time friends.”</p><p class="double">Discord thought. “Nah. Now-”</p><p class="double">She darted up and took hoof-fulls of his hair and beard, dragging him around to look her in the eyes. “I. Wasn’t. Finished. Now, the easy way is the way I just described. The <i>fun</i> way is that you don’t listen to me.”</p><p class="double">“What happens then?” Discord said, interested.</p><p class="double">Astrid smirked, and beat her rear left hoof on the ground twice.</p><p class="double">An Ursa Major, Stormfly, a chimera and a manticore lumbered into view.</p><p class="double">Notably, the Ursa was carrying an axe the size of the town hall.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Astrid said, catching her own battleaxe as Applejack heaved it over, “in that case then we try what I like to call a trial separation.”</p><p class="double">“Separation of what?” Pinkie asked brightly. “Did you two get married without telling me?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, I was thinking more… head from body.”</p><p class="double">Discord took careful note of the way Astrid was hefting the battleaxe in one wing. Then, slowly and deliberately, he tracked across the manticore (which had a tail in strike position), the chimera (all three of whose heads were snarling), the Deadly Nadder (who was in the middle of taking an ominous breath), and finally stopped on the <i>big</i> axe.</p><p class="double">“What was that bit about listening to you?”</p><p class="double">Astrid let go of his hair, and pouted. “Nobody ever takes the fun way…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.3</p><p class="double">Twilight’s horn crackled, spitting out bolts of multicoloured light every time she saw a target. Return fire splashed off her shield, and she dove through a window to get out of the direct line of fire.</p><p class="double">“Twily!” her brother said, happiness in his voice. Then his tone became more serious. “How’s things?”</p><p class="double">“Not good, really…” Twilight admitted. “The west flank’s crumbling – they must have shifted their reserves around to hit us there.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, ponyfeathers,” Shining shook his head. “Sergeant, take our own reserve and shore us up.”</p><p class="double">“That won’t hold long…” the younger sibling warned, projecting a map. Blue ‘friendly’ dots were winking out rapidly, and the green of confirmed enemies just kept coming.</p><p class="double">“I know, but we don’t have a better choice,” Shining replied.</p><p class="double">“Fair point.” Twilight’s eyes flicked up for a second, as she changed frequencies on her shield. “This should be a bit better.”</p><p class="double">The ground shook, faintly at first, but then building to an incredible grinding rumble before finally dying away.</p><p class="double">“Well, so much for the <i>east</i> flank…” Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">“That was Trixie?” Shining asked.</p><p class="double">“The ground shook too much for it to be anypony else. Wonder how they got her…”</p><p class="double">Four guards backed into the room, lashing out with spells from their horns as magic flew past in return. “Sir, we’ve lost contact with-”</p><p class="double">Twilight’s eyes narrowed, and she stunned all four of them.</p><p class="double">They fell, flashing with green flame and reverting to their base forms.</p><p class="double">“Thought so…”</p><p class="double">More changelings appeared at the window, and then the ceiling broke open.</p><p class="double">Green magic flashed from above, and after twenty frantic seconds bolts got past both Twilight’s shield and her brother’s.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” came a shout from outside.</p><p class="double">Wings buzzing, Queen Chrysalis entered the room. “I win. At last.”</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Twilight said, rolling back upright. “Good game. Same time next week?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” They shook hooves.</p><p class="double">“I have to say, Twily,” Shining muttered, rubbing a bruise ruefully, “these changelings are <i>very</i> good at magic tag.”</p><p class="double">“Comes of the hive mind,” Chrysalis said, with a slightly brittle casualness.</p><p class="double">A blue unicorn trotted into the room. “Trixie thinks that was unfair.”</p><p class="double">“It was a shield…” Chrysalis rolled her eyes. “You do this every week. Shields, disguises, swarm tactics… no matter how we beat you, it’s somehow unfair by your lights.”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Trixie said, with the tone of somepony explaining a simple concept to a foal. “Trixie does not get defeated in a fair fight. Ergo, the fights she loses are not fair.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis threw up her hooves. “This is ridiculous!”</p><p class="double">“Hey, at least you only have to deal with this kind of attitude once per week…” Twilight countered.</p><p class="double">The Changeling Queen paused, and then nodded. “Fair point.”</p><p class="double">“Trixie chooses to reject that conversation and substitute one about how awesome she is!” Trixie shouted.</p><p class="double">“Oh, grow up!” Chrysalis shot back.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is the most unconventional plan you have come up with for integrating us yet,” Chrysalis said to Twilight, then took a sip of cocoa. </p><p class="double">“Well, playing sports does help ponies get closer,” Twilight said, shrugging. “It started as an idea after a Loop somewhere where wars are done by mutual agreement in special arenas, but the idea wouldn’t go away…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.4</p><p class="double">“Do you know, I find myself rather perplexed by you,” Celestia said, lightly.</p><p class="double">Nyx looked up from an ice cream. “Really?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed I do.” Celestia inclined her teacup at the filly. “You are, as far as I understand it, generated from a version of my sister. Endowed with life but none of her memories, and then you got an abridged version of Luna’s time as Nightmare Moon.”</p><p class="double">“That’s right,” Nyx said, going back to the ice cream for a second. Then she looked up, with big innocent eyes. “So what’s the problem again?”</p><p class="double">“Well – oh, goodness, but you do those well,” Celestia said with something like admiration. “I bet you could charm the whole parliament.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks!”</p><p class="double">“Anyway. My point.” Celestia made a small gesture. “You have, at my last count, had no fewer than forty loops in which I am also a participant. Based on what I know about the Loops, there must have been many more where I was not lucky enough to also be present.”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much. Ooh, there’s boysenberry ice cream in this…” Nyx carefully manipulated the ice cream. “You don’t see that much.”</p><p class="double">“And, well, there you rather make my point.”</p><p class="double">“I do?” Nyx licked her lips clean of ice cream.</p><p class="double">“You’re well over two hundred years old, you see…” Celestia pointed. “And you still act very much like a young filly.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked back at the oldest of the Princesses for a moment. Then she balanced her ice cream carefully on the point and hit it with an ice spell, keeping it from falling over. “Okay, I’ll explain.”</p><p class="double">“Please do,” Celestia invited.</p><p class="double">“First thing is… in my home loop, or, in my first loop ‘cause this <i>is </i>kind of a home loop… the only really happy life I had was with momma-Twilight, as a little filly. When I was grown up as Nightmare Moon I was… just miserable.” Nyx shrugged uncomfortably. “I don’t like to remember it too much.”</p><p class="double">“And now?”</p><p class="double">“Now is kind of the same thing… I still remember being, well, <i>Nightmare Moon</i>. I still remember faint echoes of that need to get revenge on an uncaring world… but it’s really kind of hard to have that super evil powerful hate when you’re going to school and doing homework.” The young alicorn shook her head. “I prefer being nice, really. And being a filly makes me feel much more comfortable generally.”</p><p class="double">“It seems we all have our burdens to bear,” Celestia said, with a nod.</p><p class="double">“There’s another side to it, too, of course,” Nyx said, grinning much more comfortably. “Fillies get ice cream and stuff.”</p><p class="double">“A fair point indeed!” Celestia chuckled. “Actually, that gives me an idea…”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Who’s this?” Pinkie asked Twilight. “She looks cute!”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded down at the filly. “She’s called Helia – one of Nyx’s pen friends. I’m looking after her for the week. No, I don’t know why she’s got wings and a horn either.”</p><p class="double">“Okie dokie.” Pinkie gave the young alicorn a conspiratorial look. “Hey, you want some ice cream?”</p><p class="double">“Do I?” Helia asked with a big grin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis grumbled to herself as she finished <i>another</i> tranche of paperwork.</p><p class="double">Why the buck had she ever agreed to fill in for Celestia for a week? The alicorn had enough paperwork to choke a dragon!</p><p class="double">“Your highness,” the seneschal said, motioning to the door, “the court is to be in session momentarily.”</p><p class="double">“Do you mean soon, or for a short time?” Chrysalis asked, mentally checking her disguise was perfect.</p><p class="double">“The first one, of course, your highness.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” Chrysalis echoed. “Silly me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And so, you see, I don’t know what to do…” the stallion trailed off into mumbling.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis tasted his emotions. He didn’t have all that much hope, which perhaps wasn’t surprising – the position he was trying to advance was that he had lost much of his life’s savings in a disaster, though he himself had come through as had enough to allow him to live reasonably comfortably.</p><p class="double">But the money he’d been saving up to start a newspaper, his life’s ambition, was not available from what remained of his assets.</p><p class="double">The disguised Changeling wondered how Celestia would have resolved this. She probably would have weighed benefit against loss, deftly reshuffled funds and personalities, and linked the stallion up with either a suitably rich noble or a public works project or… something.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis didn’t have nearly that expertise… but she could sense the stallion’s sincerity, and that was enough for her.</p><p class="double">“The crown will provide funds for your project, in exchange for a thirty percent share. See the treasurer for a draft on the vaults.”</p><p class="double">Surprise, then gratitude, blossomed in the stallion’s mind like a silent supernova, and approval – and the deep, abiding love that Celestia invoked in her subjects – washed in from the walls.</p><p class="double">And since they were aimed <i>at</i> Chrysalis, at the results of <i>her</i> actions, she could absorb them with no harm to the originators at all.</p><p class="double"><i>This is why</i>, she thought, as outwardly she nodded gravely for the next case. <i>Aside from anything else, it’s like eating a gourmet meal every night.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that was interesting…” Prince Shining Armor muttered, wiping cake off his muzzle with a napkin.</p><p class="double">Princess Twilight shrugged her wings. “Sorry, Shiny. I know you’re new to the Elements…”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. We could have practised, maybe?” Shining Armor lifted the Loyalty necklace off his head, carefully making sure it didn’t get too much icing on it. “One of the things I don’t want to hear when facing down Discord is ‘wait, you <i>can</i> use these, right?’”</p><p class="double">“I said I was sorry…” Twilight said meekly. “Anyway, we did it. So, now, how do we divide things up?”</p><p class="double">Shining shrugged. “You’re the expert.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’d say military and civilian, but we don’t actually <i>have</i> much of a military.” Twilight shrugged. “Nor do they normally have much to do, aside from keeping the peace.”</p><p class="double">“Nah, that’ll be fine.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at him carefully. “If you say so.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, that’s the patrol routes worked out.” Shining shuffled his papers and handed them to Corporal Rockhoof, who accepted them and took them out of the room.</p><p class="double">“What’s next?”</p><p class="double">Shining’s aide looked lost. “What do you mean, my prince?”</p><p class="double">“I mean, what’s next on the agenda?”</p><p class="double">“Sire, you’ve been off the agenda for six months. You’ve been doing everypony else’s work. For the sake of the founders, my prince, you just reorganized the patrol routes in a remote town near Stalliongrad.”</p><p class="double">“Not following you.” Shining tapped an office toy on his desk, which started clacking merrily.</p><p class="double">“There’s no work left to <i>do</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Check again,” Shining instructed.</p><p class="double">“I did. Twice.”</p><p class="double">“Well, then.” Prince Shining Armor adjusted his chain of office (something that his sister had looked askance at), and strode out of his office.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Twilight Sparkle knocked on her brother’s door. “Hey, Shiny?”</p><p class="double">“Come in,” Shining said, and Twilight opened the door.</p><p class="double">Paperwork was piled high on the desk, and Shining was flicking through it with every appearance of enjoyment.</p><p class="double">“Oh, what’s all this in aid of?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, there was a nasty couple of robberies last night. Big money stuff. So that means a lot of work for the guard, of course. I’m coordinating the investigation, so hopefully we’ll catch this pony before they do it again.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. “That’s terrible!”</p><p class="double">“Well, not really.” Shining shrugged. “For whatever reason, they only stole about a tenth of what was actually there, so…”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight said, frowning. “That <i>is</i> strange.”</p><p class="double">“Tell me about it… so, how are things going with you?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I’ve decided to subsidize authors heavily, and see just how many books get written as a result. There’s a lot of society-engineering experiments I only really get a chance to do in these loops…” Twilight grinned. “Besides, I need <i>some</i> new books to read.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, fair point.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What, another one?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Shining said, shaking his head. “We’re no closer to this stallion than before. He stole the penthouse off a Manehattan skyrise.”</p><p class="double">“He?” Twilight asked, interested. “You got <i>something</i>, then?”</p><p class="double">“Or she.” Shining corrected himself.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, thinking.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, this is just ridiculous,” Twilight said loudly.</p><p class="double">The black-clad figure on the floor below froze, then looked up slowly.</p><p class="double">“Er… your highness?”</p><p class="double">“Lay off it, Shining, I know it’s you.” Twilight glided down from the catwalk. “You’re faking crimes so you have work to do, aren’t you.”</p><p class="double">With a flash of purple magic, the costume disintegrated.</p><p class="double">“All right, I was,” Shining Armor admitted, dropping his sack full of stolen museum exhibits on the floor. “I was <i>so</i> <i>bored!</i>”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “And you were doing <i>so</i> well… right, I think it’s moon time.”</p><p class="double">“Does it have to be?” Shining asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, it might not have to be if your thefts were lower profile. But, one way or another, this investigation you started has got out of your control. I’m only about two steps ahead of the Guard on this one.”</p><p class="double">“So…”</p><p class="double">“So we pass it off as the Alicorn Amulet corrupting you, that’s what.” Twilight threw it to him. “One big battle over the city, and then you’re off to the moon until I’ve got an Elements team assembled. Look on the bright side, though.”</p><p class="double">Shining slipped the pendant on, and his horn began to glow. A reddish tinge started slipping into the magic. “Bright side?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. By the time you get back, Cadence is going to be an adult.”</p><p class="double">The Prince nodded thoughtfully. Then opened fire.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So we need to go sort out the arrangements for the mid-year celebration?” Twilight’s oldest student, Celestia, asked.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that’s right.” Twilight nodded. “I recommend that the three of you get going. Though, actually, could Cadence stay behind? I’d like a word with her.”</p><p class="double">Celestia and Luna nodded, and left. (As it happened, they were in the ‘slots’ normally assigned to Shining and Twilight respectively. Twilight had taken on more than one student because, well, why not.)</p><p class="double">“So,” Cadence grinned. “He lost <i>that</i> little bet…”</p><p class="double">“Yes, he did.” Twilight smiled back; it had been a surprise five years ago when Cadence Awakened, but also a relief. “Just a head’s up, though, he was using the Alicorn Amulet – that’s the official reason for his banishment, and you know what that thing’s like.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, stereotypical villainy mode.” Cadence got a light in her eyes. “Does this mean he’ll kidnap me?”</p><p class="double">“That’s entirely possible, I’m afraid,” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“Afraid?” Cadence shook her head. “I’m not <i>afraid.</i> I’m <i>anticipatory.”</i></p><p class="double">“…moving on,” Twilight said quickly. “I don’t know exactly how the Elements are going to break down this time. Just, well, make sure Luna doesn’t blow up at Pinkie or something…”</p><p class="double">“Will do, Twilight.” Cadence flipped up a wing in salute, then giggled. “Hang on, I have to go get some Cosmic Spectrum stone…”</p><p class="double"><i>Wonder what she’s up to,</i> Twilight thought absently.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You’ll never get away with this!” Luna shouted.</p><p class="double">“Actually, I think you’ll find I already have,” the dark stallion said with a menacing chuckle, his voice resonating with the walls. “Not only have I kidnapped you, I have also turned the lovely Cadence to my side!”</p><p class="double">“Muahaha and stuff,” Cadence said, trotting out from behind him.</p><p class="double">“You monster!” Luna struggled with the magical shields holding her down. “How did you corrupt such an innocent pony?”</p><p class="double">The alicorn’s eyes lost a little of their red glow. “I’m not entirely sure, actually. I was planning to use her as a hostage, but that didn’t pan out because hostages don’t normally take their captors side this fast. And now she’s an alicorn for some reason.”</p><p class="double">“Go Shiny!” Cadence said, waving pom-poms.</p><p class="double">Luna shook her head. “You’re really lowering the tone, here, Cadence.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry.” Cadence put the pom-poms down and kicked them away. “I’m enthusiastic, okay?”</p><p class="double">“Now, as I was saying. I am unstoppable!” The alicorn amulet gleamed redly below his neck. “The Elements of Harmony will only activate for a full six ponies, so with young Luna here-”</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Luna said, eyes suddenly intent. “They require six ponies?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Sundered Armor said, his voice still gleaming with malice.</p><p class="double">At that point, the door exploded in under a laser lance of sunlight.</p><p class="double">“Luna!” Celestia said, horn flaring, as she charged through the door with Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy and Rarity behind her. “Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“I’ve been better…” Luna said pointedly.</p><p class="double">“We’re here to save you!” Celestia waved the Element of Magic around, then put it on her forehead. The other five matched her with their necklaces.</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Sundered looked resigned. “Well, bu-”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Now for you,” Celestia said, pointing at Cadence. “Don’t worry, you’ll be alright soon.”</p><p class="double">“I’m alright now,” Cadence said, shrugging. “No actual corruption involved. Now sit down before you fall down, Celly, you look exhausted.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Celestia sank back onto the floor, keeping an eye on the collapsed and younger Shining Armor. “Why did you join him, then?”</p><p class="double">Cadence blushed. “He’s a hunk, that’s why.”</p><p class="double">“Well, then,” Princess Twilight said, flashing into existence. “Good to see that all worked out. Congratulations on the new horn, Cadence.”</p><p class="double">“Do you know <i>everything</i> before we do?” Luna asked, stretching.</p><p class="double">“Not quite.” Twilight winked. “Anyway, I see you’ve met my brother.”</p><p class="double">The Elements and Luna all paused.</p><p class="double">“Now y’all say it, yer highness, ah do kinda see the family resemblance…” Applejack ventured. “How come he went loco?”</p><p class="double">“Underwork,” Twilight summarized. “Now, shall we go and have that mid-year celebration? I think we all need to relax. And yes, Cadence, you can ‘keep him’, so long as he follows you home.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.6</p><p class="double">“For, you see, I am not in truth a skink,” the small reptile said. “I am a handsome dragon, turned thus by the spell of a witch. I need but a kiss to-”</p><p class="double">Twilight skidded into the garden. “Hi, guys, big problem. We – wait a second.”</p><p class="double">She looked between the skink and the suddenly blushing Rarity. “Were you two seriously reenacting the Princess and the Frog? No, on second thoughts I don&#039;t want to know...”</p><p class="double">With a moment of morphic uncertainty, Spike returned to his default size nowadays – about the same mass as Twilight, but bipedal instead of quadrupedal. “Ahem. What was that, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Twilight pointed. “Basically, have you guys ever heard of frost giants?”</p><p class="double">Both Spike and Rarity shook their heads.</p><p class="double">“Right. Well, neither had I until one came over the border. They&#039;re kind of like the bigger, meaner cousins of Windigoes.” Twilight counted on her hooves. “Four, five... and Dash isn&#039;t Awake this Loop... in fact, I think she&#039;s in San Equus or something. It&#039;s just going to be easier for you to sub in, Spike.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha.” Spike summoned his Element with a flash of red light.</p><p class="double">Rarity matched him, and transitioned up to Alicorn with the ease of long practise. “When do we go?”</p><p class="double">“Few minutes,” Twilight replied. “I&#039;ll teleport us all to Vanhoofer, that&#039;s where it&#039;s approaching.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe it just wants a coffee?” Spike suggested, stretching.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s Seaddle, of course, dear,” Rarity corrected him.</p><p class="double">“Oh, my mistake.”</p><p class="double">Twilight wove a net of magic about them-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">-and they were looking at a very distinctive mountain range being stepped on by something taller than said mountains.</p><p class="double">“Whoa, that&#039;s big...” Spike muttered. “I hope you don&#039;t want us to wrestle it...”</p><p class="double">“No, that&#039;s fine.” Twilight vanished again, then deposited Fluttershy, Applejack, Pinkie and Trixie next to them in quick succession.</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go.” Twilight went Alicorn, and the rest followed suit. “I&#039;ve got no idea how nasty this thing is, so we&#039;d better err on the side of overdoing it. Trix, you want to play defence?”</p><p class="double">“It depends what defence means.” Trixie began casting her own enhancement spells.</p><p class="double">“Explode it until we&#039;re ready.”</p><p class="double">“DIBS!” the blue alicorn shouted, and promptly broke about five Equestrian laws on responsible magic channeling levels. Then three more on excessive noise levels, two which governed what spell-types were permitted within metropolitan areas, and something to do with sunburn on top of that.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Guys, focus!” Twilight said sharply.</p><p class="double">“Sorry,” Spike said, shaking his head to clear it. “Trixie&#039;s impressive when she gets going.”</p><p class="double">“This is why I don&#039;t take <i>any</i> fashion direction from her...” Rarity confirmed. “She&#039;d try to make an exploding dress.”</p><p class="double">The ice giant slipped, its huge feet not finding proper purchase on a lake of lava. A tiny blue spark, shining like a star, flitted above it and began launching yet more attacks.</p><p class="double">“Okay, done!” Twilight said finally, and rainbow light sliced across the sky.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So...” Rarity said, uncertainly, once the press had been persuaded to leave them alone. “What was that all in aid of?”</p><p class="double">“I have no idea.” Twilight shrugged. “Suppose it&#039;s a Loop variant, that&#039;s all – I&#039;ve <i>been</i> to the Frozen North a lot before, if they were standard issue I&#039;d have met them before.”</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy raised a hoof.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” several of them said at once.</p><p class="double">“I think that was a... they turn up in stories on Oerth. It&#039;s a Xixecal.”</p><p class="double">“Say that again, but slower?” Applejack requested.</p><p class="double">“Xixecal.”</p><p class="double">“Nope, still no idea how t&#039; pronounce it...”</p><p class="double">“Okay, so what are they?” Twilight asked, to forestall the confusing argument she could see coming.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Er... sort of like half-made gods, or something. They&#039;re often a concept made material – like that one was cold. They&#039;re mentioned in druid training, but I forgot...” Fluttershy shrank back into her chair a bit. “Sorry. They scare me.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s fine,” Twilight reassured her automatically. “Can you tell if there&#039;s any others?”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Fluttershy closed her eyes for a moment, then they opened again.</p><p class="double">“Well?”</p><p class="double">She nodded. “Two. One called a phaheon – it&#039;s made of lava – and one called a Phane. The Phane does time dilation.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll handle him!” Pinkie said eagerly. “I can bring all my apprentices!”</p><p class="double">“Apprentices?” Twilight parroted.</p><p class="double">“Yeah! I wouldn&#039;t normally, but I&#039;m totally going to go and get the mirror pool going again!”</p><p class="double">“Well, we&#039;re doomed...” Spike said conversationally.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Wait, I just realized. Where&#039;s Trixie?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Trixie demands justice! Or she will swear everlasting vengeance. Or, on balance, simply insist Twilight pays for her lunch for a Loop.”</p><p class="double">The blue-coated alicorn looked down at Equestria hanging below her, and continued spellcasting.</p><p class="double">Intellectually, she knew it was just being so close to the monster which had caught her in a high powered use of the Elements.</p><p class="double">Emotionally, she was going to write something defamatory on the moon about Twilight Sparkle until she felt better. Then she was going to look into a non-magical method of lunar escape.</p><p class="double"><i>It&#039;s not like it&#039;s rocket science, right? Oops, bad analogy.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.7 (Grinnerz)</p><p class="double">Twilight Greenhilt had a very slight problem. “Why is it that I almost always wake up as human mid-stride? And how do the locals balance on such thin legs anyway? And WHAT am I wearing? …Okay, the purple top and pink skirt I get, but why the bare midriff? No matter, on to learning!” She was not going to pass up the first day awake at an academy of magic she hadn’t been to before after all.</p><p class="double">Walking through the halls of Warthog’s School of Wizardry and Sorcery she couldn’t help but overhear snippets of conversations. The speech bubbles took some getting used to though.</p><p class="double">“…and that’s why the d100 is a superior percentile than two d10.”</p><p class="double">“…so I told Stacy, like, I <i>rolled</i> my stats. This 17 Charisma: all natural. Not like that cloak she always wears.”</p><p class="double">‘<i>Okay this loop’s a bit outside the norm for me, but I can roll with it.’</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Suddenly the bell began to ring calling students to class. The seeing the stairway she needed already clogged by her peers Twilight ran down ways to speed her passage. “No, I will not be tardy the first day. Let’s see what local magic can do. <b><i>Dimension Hop.</i></b>”</p><p class="double">A bystander had this to say:”Ugh, <i>sooo not</i> a core spell.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sitting down at the back of the class Twilight took a moment to observe her classmates. She did a double take as a Harry Potter look-alike sat two rows up. A red-haired kid across the room seemed to be staring at her, though why he had a pointed ear on the right side of his head and no one else had visible ears at all she didn’t know. In fact none of the other students had visible anythings under their pulled up hoods.</p><p class="double">A grey haired woman walked into the room. “Welcome class to Necromancy 101. I’ll be your homeroom teacher Professor McDougal. Now I’m going to call roll.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Greenhilt.”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“Pompey.”</p><p class="double">“Here.” It was the red-haired boy.</p><p class="double">“Larry Gardener.”</p><p class="double">“Here, guvnor.” The Not-Potter said.</p><p class="double">“He Who Must Not Be Named”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“The One Who Must Not Be Named”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“She Who Must Not Be Looked At.”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“They Who Must Not Be Spoken To.”</p><p class="double">“…” “…”</p><p class="double">“Right, never mind. He Who Must Not Be Toilet-Trained…” *Sniff-sniff* “Pompey I believe you are on mop duty this week.”</p><p class="double">*Sigh* “Yes Professor.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">‘<i>And other loopers say Equestria is weird. Alright: diagnostic spell complete. Pinkie is here somewhere but not nearby. Other than that there is no one I can detect. Well, how much trouble can she get into anyway?’</i></p><p class="double">A flash of lightning and a crack of thunder interrupted her thoughts.</p><p class="double">“Don’t worry class: the druid college down the road is practising controlling the weather today.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“<b><i>Meanwhile, deep in the Redmountain Hills our intrepid band of adventurers: The Order of the Stick is camped.

There they saw a shift from the norm.</p><p class="double">Like usual, the figure’s clothing had an opposite colour scheme than Elan, or Pinkie in this case. But whereas Pinkie had wild pink hair the newcomer’s was strait as a razor, and the gleam in her eyes was less welcoming than Pinkie’s friendly insanity. And of course, the one feature they had been half expecting…</p><p class="double">“Wowie-zowie! I look good with a goatee!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.8 (Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie blinked.</p><p class="double">She was suddenly in her room Sugarcube Corner. She had Awoke again! What kinds of fun she&#039;d have this loop?</p><p class="double">&#039;Wait a little, let me check something first.&#039; And so she checked her surroundings: no access to worshippers for chaos magic, and her loop memories told her this seemed a baseline loop. Looking at the window she could see Matilda going a bit slower than usual (the news of Princess Celestia coming to Ponyville to raise the sun herself made her a bit melancholic for Cranky Doodle), which seemed to confirm this idea.</p><p class="double">Yep, baseline loop all right. Pinkie wondered if Big Mac is awake this time as she had a super special idea for the bar--</p><p class="double">Baseline loop? Pinkie Pie stopped and was reminded of something very important. Concentrating in her Element of Laughter she peeked to check which other elements were Awoke. With a happy feeling much like the Diet Cola volcano would feel when the Mentos stalactites fall in she received two answers: Magic and Loyalty.</p><p class="double">Dashie is awake? That changes all the plans: the Prank Wars versus Dashie start now! First one to force the other to use a non-baseline ability wins! Checking her loop memories Pinkie Pie realized the hidden town props were in pattern Cake-4-Tea. That&#039;d surely will give them a good head start! With some luck she might win even before Twilight arrives to Ponyville.</p><p class="double">Having set in her plan, Pinkie Pie trotted out of her room. She had to move quickly, after all early to Awake gets to dethrone Discord.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Wearing her Groucho glasses Pinkie Pie hid inside a cardboard box by the park pondered her next move. Rainbow Dash had been a thought cookie, like one stale for a few weeks: even when Pinkie put a statue near the town hall and starting advertising herself as a priest of the Church of Discord hadn&#039;t bore fruits. Well, Dashie knows Discord may be awake and all.</p><p class="double">Going for Anarchism again? Not too hard but not good for this time. Fluttershy isn&#039;t Awake and her nonlooper self is still too timid to help Pinkie in making an Equestrian revolution. Even if she had been awake, asking for looper help in the pranks was against the rules.</p><p class="double">Idea! She had to find Lyra while making her way to Sugarcube Corner to get a rope, meringue, her candy-copter, flour, a spell cast, a parasol and some frosting. To the Pinkie-cave!</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><i>One</i></p><p class="double">Pinkie saw a rainbow-colored streak of light going through the sky.</p><p class="double"><i>Two</i></p><p class="double">It looks like Dashie&#039;s meeting with Twilight is going as baseline, and now she&#039;s trying to clear the sky in ten seconds flat.</p><p class="double"><i>Three</i></p><p class="double">But Pinkie had counted on that, leaving a surprise on a cloud.</p><p class="double"><i>Four</i></p><p class="double">Asking looper help was off-limits, but nopony said Pinkie couldn&#039;t ask Lyra to cast a cloud-walking spell on her.</p><p class="double"><i>Five</i></p><p class="double">Then it was only a matter of getting to a cloud with the candy-copter. Pinkie almost looked like Applejack when she lassoed it!</p><p class="double"><i>Six</i></p><p class="double">Than Pinkie had to use her Earth Pony magic in the flour to make the cloud could hold as much meringue and frosting as possible, leaving the most sticky cloud since ever.</p><p class="double"><i>Seven</i></p><p class="double">Getting down was just a matter of jumping down and opening the parasol at a proper time,</p><p class="double"><i>Eight</i></p><p class="double">She&#039;s coming to the cloud, just in time and with a very fast dive. Perfect</p><p class="double"><i>Nine</i></p><p class="double">Aaaand... there! Just when she was going to pass through the last cloud in the sky she got stuck into it, and being unable to flap her wings she couldn&#039;t do other thing than fall to the ground. Perfect!</p><p class="double">Then Pinkie Pie walked to the grounds where Dashie had fell, She had to check when currently trapped pegasus surrendered the bet after all. It was then when she realized somepony purple in the corner of her eyes.</p><p class="double">Upon that Pinkie extended her hooves sideways as to block Twilight&#039;s path and looked at her unicorn friend. &quot;Wait a moment Twilight, we are in the middle of our Prank Wars. No help now until Dashie surrenders.&quot;</p><p class="double">Though to her surprise if wasn&#039;t Twilight who answered. &quot;You know, Pinkie,&quot; she heard Spike&#039;s voice and turned to the other side only to realize he was as tall as her, &quot;I don&#039;t think Rainbow is Awake right now.&quot; And then he concentrated a bit to make his own Element of Loyalty appear in his hand.</p><p class="double">Erm... &quot;Oopsie?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.9 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">&quot;Raaaahhhh!&quot; A vast blast of dragon fire burst from the cave mouth.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle walked out of the cave, mane singed in a humorous manner. &quot;Well that didn&#039;t work. I quoted all the relevant parts of the treaty of Lonely Mountain. While that dragon is allowed to use the cave as a stop-over, he&#039;s not allowed to set up a semi-permanent residence there. That&#039;s why we have dragon zoning in the Everfree Forest! Maybe I overdid it with the half hour presentation, and the slide show...&quot;</p><p class="double">An outside observer who knew of such things, would have deduced the entire mane six, plus Spike, were looping from the lack of terror at their fearless leader having been subjected to the equivalent of a blast from a ship mounted plasma cannon. Oh, and that Spike was snuggled up against Rarity, who was cracking open a geode and feeding him gems in the manner of a girl peeling grapes. She spoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, should I ask Spikey-wikey to act as my champion when I go in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like you need one, even without going full alicorn.&quot; Applejack commented, reshaping the earth into little dragon statues. &quot;You duke it out with Spike when he&#039;s cranked up to, what the hay was it, Great Wyrm? Big and mean and about the size of Buckingham palace anyhow.&quot;</p><p class="double">The little dragon cracked his knuckles. &quot;Okay, I won&#039;t crank myself higher than Young Adult. Beating that Old guy with an equivalent age category just isn&#039;t a challenge any more.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh!&quot; Twilight shook her head, smoothing out her mane with a cosmetic spell. &quot;Rainbow&#039;s got next place on the rota this time remember? After the thing at the place...&quot;</p><p class="double">The ponies shuddered, except for Pinkie, who grinned brightly. &quot;But it was such a cool way to use a dozen cubic hooves of liquid rainbow and a raw egg!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash recovered quickly, and flew up in the air. &quot;Aw yeah! Yo, big red, you in there! If you aren&#039;t going to play nice with the other foals, I&#039;m gonna fly in there and kick you right in the jaw!&quot;</p><p class="double">A blast of smoke engulfed her from the cave mouth. It blasted away to reveal the clear pocket of air she&#039;d wrapped around herself with her weather magic. &quot;Okay buddy, you asked for it!&quot;</p><p class="double">She shot off, away from the mountaintop, cracking out her first rainbow shockwave before she&#039;d gotten more than a few hundred pony-lengths. The rainbow contrail vanished into the sky, only to turn into the trail of a glowing polychromatic comet a few moments later. Twilight did some calculations based on the pegasus&#039;s rate of approach and decided she&#039;d grown even stronger since her friend last tested herself. The purple unicorn cast a structural integrity spell at range... on the dragon. This way it would only feel like he was getting his head ripped off by the impact, rather than it actually happening.</p><p class="double">Dash arrived at high mach numbers, encased in a glowing rainbow aura and vanished into the cave, rear hoof first in a flying kick. An instant later, the dragon flew out of the cave&#039;s rear entrace, newly created by it&#039;s body being smashed through the back wall. It fell a good way, then managed to right itself in mid-air, and blast her with superheated plasma, which split around either side of her as she guided the air-flow. The subsequent beat down was short and brutal, for the dragon. It dwarfed the pegasus fighting it to insignificance, and it didn&#039;t matter.</p><p class="double">Ultiimately Dash carried the dragon back by it&#039;s tail, which she held in her teeth, as the dragon was hurt too badly to still fly. She laid him out on the ledge in front of the others. &quot;Uh... that rainbow one kicked me!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy trotted over, showing only the slightest trace of her once fear. Becoming an Alicorn, staring down Discord a few hundred times, not to mention the God Emperor of Mankind had helped her overcome it... not to mention that as a high level druid, her will save was off the top of the charts. She laid her hooves to the dragon&#039;s fore-paw claw and cast Heal (not that the spell needed contact, but she felt it would be more reassuring.) &quot;I know, and I&#039;m sure she&#039;s very sorry about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually I&#039;m not.&quot; Dash stated, flexing her wings to get the kinks out. &quot;That was a great workout.&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon&#039;s injuries had vanished, in fact he felt like a vast hoard of gems. &quot;You caught me off guard. Next time you won&#039;t be so lucky.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rather than quailing, the rainbow pegasus seemed pleased. &quot;Wanna prove that? Best of three!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa Dash!&quot; Twilight called out. &quot;Sparring later. We&#039;re still sorting out the fact that he... I&#039;m sorry sir, I didn&#039;t get your name.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am Vantuvir the Mighty, Vantuvir of the Flaming Scale, Vantuvir the Wrath Bringer...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, Mr Vantuvir here shouldn&#039;t actually be sleeping here. Smoke covering all of Equestria, remember?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... actually Twilight, I cured the snoring while I was healing him. It was a symptom of the obstructive form of sleep apnoea. It can lead to all kinds of nasty secondary effects.&quot; She turned to the dragon and gave him a low level Stare. &quot;You should take better care of yourself mister!&quot; </p><p class="double">The dragon flinched and looked away, instead focussing on the flyer above. &quot;Now your friend healed me up, I can crush you!&quot;</p><p class="double">His head was forcefully turned to face Twilight by a grip of purple magic. &quot;Now just stop that! If you act up again, you won&#039;t face just her, you face all of us...&quot;</p><p class="double">She was blasted by another wave of dragon fire, which splashed back at him from the bowl shaped shield of purple force that formed in front of her. &quot;That didn&#039;t work last time, why did you think this would be any different? Applejack?&quot;</p><p class="double">The farm-pony nodded and placed her hooves against the outcropping, which reshaped itself into a stylised sculpture of a dragon. she then turned and kicked it with her hind hooves, splitting it off at the base and sending it flying away from the plateau. It was caught by Twilight&#039;s magic, and hauled back to hover in mid-air, without her releasing her telekinetic grip on the real dragon. </p><p class="double">&quot;We may not be as big as you...&quot; The glow around the statue brightened, and compressed to crush the statue to pebbles. &quot;... but we ponies have our own strength.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And they&#039;ve got us too!&quot; Spike said, moving into his line of sight. &quot;Me and Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A silly frilly pony and a wyrmling?&quot; Vantuvir exclaimed incredulously.</p><p class="double">Spike made a pose and flexed his muscles, which began to swell, and didn&#039;t stop. He exploded upwards until he towered over the dragon in full Great Wyrm form, with Rarity riding his shoulder ridge.</p><p class="double">&quot;You were saying?&quot; he rumbled. &quot;I suggest you apologise to my beloved. Rarity is the most precious of gems to me, more valued than a mountain of flawless diamond. She&#039;s beautiful, generous, beautiful, can find gems with her magic, beautiful, courageous, beautiful, refined... and did I mention beautiful? Well it&#039;s worth saying again!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Spikey-wikey, you&#039;re so sweet!&quot; Rarity nuzzled into his neck ridges.</p><p class="double">He leaned over the crimson dragon and glared at him, and the other dragon quailed again. He had enough quails by now to feed a banquet. &quot;I... apologise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Great Wyrm Spike grinned, which was only marginally less terrifying. &quot;By the way, I think you should know I&#039;m not the one you should be worried about. Even a romance for the ages such as ours has it&#039;s rough spots, and on the few occasions we fought, she&#039;s beaten me two times out of three. So, word to the wise, just do as they say, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon gave a huff and said, &quot;I don&#039;t have a choice, do I!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great!&quot; Twilight said brightly. &quot;Now as to the cave you&#039;ll be moving to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; The dragon looked completely non-plussed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just because you can&#039;t stay here, doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t understand you need somewhere to rest. Rarity found a cavern on the outskirts of the badlands, it&#039;s almost as big as this one, plenty large enough for your hoard, and it has a couple of gemstone veins so if you wake up after a few decades with a case of the munchies, you don&#039;t have to deplete it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie piped up. &quot;I even made you a cave warming cake!&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled a cake taller than she was, heavily decorated with gems, from her sub-space pocket.</p><p class="double">&quot;Trust me, Pinkie&#039;s cakes are not to be sneezed at.&quot; Mega-Spike added, licking his lips.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well of course not!&quot; Pinkie looked up at the big dragon. &quot;They&#039;re made to be eaten! Of course if you sneezed at it, it would be sent to Princess Celestia, and while she likes cake, I don&#039;t think she&#039;d enjoy the gemstones...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But then why didn&#039;t you tell me about that?&quot; The dragon asked.</p><p class="double">&#039;Because you generally won&#039;t listen until some-pony knocks the stuffing out of you...&#039; muttered Twilight, then said out loud, &quot;That was on the next slide, complete with a picture. However, you incinerated my slide projector before I could get to it. C&#039;mon, we&#039;ll help you pack.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">32.10 (misterq)</p><p class="double">Twilight woke up in a forest to the grinning faces of a blue unicorn and a pink unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twilight; wake up!&quot; said the smiling blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, you silly sleepy head; wake up!&quot; the pink unicorn was positively grinning.</p><p class="double">Twilight just blinked and stared at the two unicorns in front of her. This was all a little too disturbingly familiar.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re going on an adventure, Twilight,&quot; the blue unicorn exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! Come with us, Twilight! It&#039;ll be an adventure!&quot; the pink one chimed in, &quot;We&#039;re going To Candy Mountain!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight kept staring at the two, deep in thought; before making up her mind. She turned to the blue unicorn and slowly said, &quot;What did you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Me?&quot; The blue unicorn actually took a few steps back, &quot;I didn&#039;t do anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pink unicorn&#039;s eyes lost focus as her imagination ran wild, &quot;Candy Mountain! You fill me with sweet, sugary goodness!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just kept her accusatory stare on the blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;This loop is not the fault of the great and powerful Trixie,&quot; said the blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s certainty not the fault of unicorn Pinkie Pie,&quot; Twilight kept staring at Trixie. Idly, she wondered if Pinkie was actually insane this time or just pretending to be. &#039;Probably a little from both columns,&#039; she decided.</p><p class="double">The show-mare remained defiant, pausing only to look at Pinkie Pie; who had now started to sing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, when you&#039;re down and looking for some cheering up, then just head right on up to the Candy Mountain cave,&quot; the unicorn Pinkie Pie sang gleefully.</p><p class="double">Trixie broke down, &quot;Okay, fine. I mean, you try and alter the Giga Slave spell and accidentally blow up just one planet and suddenly, everything is Trixie&#039;s fault.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We were on the planet at the time, Trixie,&quot; Twilight deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;We were the only ones on the planet along with Pinkie Pie,&quot; Trixie defended herself, &quot;It was either experiment with spells or suffer a &#039;chimmi-cherry, cherry-changa&#039; level discussion until the loop ended.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued to sing obliviously, &quot;when you get inside, you&#039;ll find yourself a cheering land; such a happy and joyful and perky, merry land.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what, Trixie,&quot; Twilight said as she slowly got up while at the same time magically picking up a large oddly shaped rock, &quot;I&#039;m going to take this kidney-shaped rock and beat you with it until you learn not to cause extinction-level events ever again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on, there was no way I could have predicted that the unstable spell would backfire,&quot; Trixie started to backpedal away from a slowly, unflinchingly advancing Twilight. &quot;And I totally thought that thing was only a small moon, right up until I activated its superlaser. Also thanks to me, we now know that the accio summoning spell works just fine on large asteroids. And who knew that that would happen if Derpy&#039;s talent for entropy was amplified, right? No pony told me during that loop that her cutie mark represented a molecule with broken atomic bonds.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just kept walking at a steady pace, neither speeding up nor wavering. Trixie finally broke into a frantic gallop. Amidst the joyous singing of a mostly oblivious Pinkie Pie, the two other unicorns chased each other. </p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>33.1</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her eyes, and easily recognized one of the things which was clearly... a little off, about this loop.</p><p class="double"><i>Right, let&#039;s see...</p><p class="double"></i>Point one: she was human – to be precise, a young child. Not all that odd, but... notable, still.</p><p class="double">Point two: none of the other Elements were around.</p><p class="double">And point three: her loop memories had a severe overtone of phobia. For <i>horses</i>, of all things.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, I&#039;m a princess. Princess? No, small-p. The heir. But the heir presumptive, not the heir in law, interesting. Why? I&#039;m not a Herald. Mother – the Queen – is. And it&#039;s interesting that she&#039;s Queen Celestia, I must check if she&#039;s Awake.</p><p class="double">Heralds have Companions – magical horses, I think. I don&#039;t know much about that. Why am I scared of them?</p><p class="double"></i>To the child she was Replacing, it wouldn&#039;t have been at all obvious exactly what was behind the phobia. But to Twilight herself, with many years effectively spent as a politician... it was blatantly clear.</p><p class="double"><i>My nurse. Hulda.</p><p class="double"></i>Nothing to be done for now, except to get dressed and ready for the day. Whoever it was Twilight was taking the place of was a truly astonishing brat... that, at least, was easy to fix.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight stepped smartly out of her room, wincing internally at the cautious look a servant gave her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, your royal highness,&quot; Hulda said, walking up with a hint of surprise. &quot;You&#039;re up very early. And did you dress yourself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I did, Hulda,&quot; Twilight replied, with a carefully judged hint of deference.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you&#039;re forgetting yourself, your highness. After all, you don&#039;t have to dress yourself – that&#039;s what servants are for.&quot;</p><p class="double">This woman was setting Twilight&#039;s teeth on edge. She had been carefully and deliberately moulding the young princess into a disaster of a girl and even worse of a potential ruler.</p><p class="double">She did wonder why Celestia – or whoever Celestia was replacing – hadn&#039;t caught it yet, but the answer was simple enough. Chronic overwork, like usual.</p><p class="double">At least Celestia had the comfort of her Companion, this Loop. A large, robust mare whose coat was so dark that Twilight easily made the connection with Luna.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Hulda?&quot; Twilight asked, curiously. &quot;Why do you keep giving my other nurse that drink?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s medicine,&quot; Hulda said shortly. &quot;Come on, you have to-”</p><p class="double">&quot;But if it&#039;s medicine, why are you using magic to make her take it?”</p><p class="double">Hulda jerked as if stung, and Twilight fought down a grin. <i>Gotcha!</p><p class="double"></i>“Don&#039;t be silly,” the nurse said eventually. “Magic! You&#039;re imagining things.”</p><p class="double">“But I saw you cast the spell...” Twilight trailed off with artful uncertainty.</p><p class="double">At that point, the door opened.</p><p class="double">“Hello, Mother,” Twilight said, standing. “Did you know Hulda can do magic? She&#039;s so clever.”</p><p class="double">Celestia drew a slim sword. “So, you must be the accomplice.”</p><p class="double">“Accomplice?” Twilight parroted, slightly surprised at Celestia&#039;s willingness to draw steel.</p><p class="double">Hulda swore.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s hand crackled with electricity as she launched forward a stun spell, which smashed through a hastily raised shield and stunned the mage.</p><p class="double">“Well, I suppose that answers the question of whether or not you&#039;re Awake...” Celestia said, lowering the sword as guards rushed into the room. “A very nice touch, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks,” Twilight said, smiling. “I think the person I&#039;ve Replaced may have been supposed to have had a bit of magical talent herself.”</p><p class="double">Both of them paused.</p><p class="double">“That wasn&#039;t very easy on the tongue, was it...” Celestia remarked critically.</p><p class="double">“If I said she was sidestined to have magic, then you&#039;d have not understood me,” Twilight retorted. “I did invent this whole set of extra tenses, you know... Anyway, how did you know that fast?”</p><p class="double">“Give me credit,” Celestia said, sitting down on one of the chairs in the royal nursery. “One of my counsellors here was working against me. It took me a few hours to spot it, but they have a lovely spell here called the Truth spell. We should try to learn it...”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s notebook seemed to teleport into her hands (which wasn&#039;t a surprise, because it did.) “Truth spell? How much of a truth spell?”</p><p class="double">“Two levels. First level detects falsehood, second level forces truth.” Celestia smiled. “I suppose it might be a good one to teach Applejack.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, scribbling away. “Is Luna Awake?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, and complaining – a lot!” Celestia grinned, then shrugged. “Okay, Twilight, I&#039;ll go make sure the country&#039;s running properly. Fair warning – we&#039;ve got our work cut out for us here, this place isn&#039;t a great power like Equestria is and it has more enemies. That&#039;s why I went for the sword – I may as well start as I&#039;ll have to go on.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded soberly.</p><p class="double">It was hard to accept, sometimes, that there were Loops where friendship really couldn&#039;t fix anything. Not coincidentally, they often coincided with the Loops where Twilight was forced into human body shape and out of touch with most of her power.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, hello!” a familiar voice said, as Twilight plonked yet another book on the finished pile.</p><p class="double">She turned. “Wait, is that <i>Hiccup?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Exactly,” Hiccup said, strolling in. “We&#039;re seeing a lot of one another lately... I&#039;m the Queen&#039;s Own, by the way. That basically means-”</p><p class="double">“You have about the same job I did in my home Loop,” Twilight finished for him.</p><p class="double">“Just about.” Hiccup sat down opposite her. “Any good books?”</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed to one of them. “Good story, interesting ideas for what to try out later this Loop. Did you let Celestia know you&#039;re Looping?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, is she one of yours? And Awake?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and Hiccup frowned.</p><p class="double">“Well, great. She must have been laughing at me all through our meeting... anyway. Toothless is here, too, but he&#039;s a Companion.”</p><p class="double">“So is Luna.”</p><p class="double">“Bet she&#039;s taking it better, though.” Hiccup leaned back in his chair. “It&#039;s all moan whine complain I preferred wings.”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight watched as something pulsed in the Grove. By the looks of things, she was about to get a Companion...</p><p class="double"><i>What in the name of me?</i> A familiar mental voice asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Dash?”</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, well spotted...</i> Dash&#039;s mental tone was a bit snippy. <i>Now, why am I an earth pony horse?</p><p class="double"></i>“I assume it&#039;s the rules here.”</p><p class="double"><i>Rules, ha! At least I&#039;m still blue.</p><p class="double"></i></p><p><hr></p><p>Twilight looked up, frowning.</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I just have a... suspicion, about that mission you sent Hiccup on. You know, to that country next door?”</p><p class="double">“I assure you, I know the one.” Celestia said, then tapped her chin. “I wonder what it could be...”</p><p class="double">With a flicker of movement, Toothless – dragon, not Companion – materialized overhead. There were several gasps of surprise, and at least one Herald went for their bow before Twilight and Celestia could tell them to stand down.</p><p class="double">“That was <i>not</i> fun,” Hiccup said, shaking his head. “Hey, did you know the crown prince of that place is a blood mage? Well, I say is... more like was.”</p><p class="double">“What did you do?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Toothless burped.</p><p class="double">“Oh, shut up,” Hiccup said with a grin. “No, Toothless <i>didn&#039;t</i> eat him. We did blow him up a bit, though.”</p><p class="double">“How do you blow someone up a bit?” Celestia asked, concealing a grin.</p><p class="double"><i>I only got his trousers,</i> Toothless explained.</p><p class="double">Twilight steadied herself as Dash began laughing.</p><p class="double">“So, what happens now?” Hiccup asked. “I mean, I&#039;ve got a few ideas, but you&#039;re the one in charge. Apparently.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you.” Celestia closed her eyes for a moment, and Luna beneath her rolled <i>her</i> eyes at some unheard comment.</p><p class="double">“Right. Twilight, how are you doing at adapting your magic here?”</p><p class="double">“Not as well as I could be...” Twilight shrugged. “The magic system here is kind of bizarre, all lines and nodes. But in an emergency I can pull off a work-around.”</p><p class="double">“Please do.” Celestia pointed towards Ancar&#039;s kingdom. “I would like you and Hiccup to give us magical fire support. Non lethal, of course. I think it&#039;s time for a bit of an invasion.”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.” Twilight snapped her fingers, and produced a small bracelet with a coin, like an ancient Athenian Drachma, dangling from it. “Okay, OWL. Set up.”</p><p class="double">The coin flashed, and reshaped into a baton. Set up. Good morning, mistress.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hey, you <i>have</i> got an Intelligent Device,” Hiccup said, interested. “I did wonder...”</p><p class="double">“I hardly ever use him because he&#039;s a bit of a crutch,” Twilight admitted. “It&#039;s more interesting to reverse engineer Nanoha&#039;s spells to fit my own personal magical abilities. But since I haven&#039;t <i>got</i> my personal magic working here yet...”</p><p class="double">“I agree.” Hiccup nodded. “I, on the other hand, have had Raising Dragon for quite a while.”</p><p class="double"><i>Wait,</i> Dash mindspoke slowly. <i>Does this mean we&#039;re going to be the horse archers from Tartarus?</p><p class="double"></i>“Pretty much,” Twilight replied. “Owl, arbalest form.”</p><p class="double">Arbalest mode engaged.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Ancar put his head in his hands. “Where did it all go wrong?”</p><p class="double">“That would be when you declared war on Valdemar, sire,” his chief advisor said helpfully.</p><p class="double">The mage-king had nearly enough time to start throttling his chief advisor, but then the wall exploded inwards and the whole issue became sort of moot.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, that was fun,” Hiccup said. “What now?”</p><p class="double">“Now we relax... unless there&#039;s something <i>else</i> out there to be a problem,” Twilight replied. “I for one am looking forward to more than five years of continuous research without a political job.”</p><p class="double">“Actually,” Celestia said, voice wheedling. “I do have quite a lot of paperwork, and the heir should be experienced at-”</p><p class="double">“No.” Twilight held up a hand, flat with the palm. “Not interested, not listening. I&#039;m going to go research how magic works here.”</p><p class="double">The Queen shook her head. “If you&#039;re sure...”</p><p class="double">“Look, you&#039;ve got Hiccup and Toothless to draw on. They&#039;re older than <i>me.</i> By, well, a few thousand loops, I think...”</p><p class="double">“Stop trying to draw me into this,” Hiccup replied. “Hey, I wonder if I can pass Toothless off as a really big bird? I want into the Hawkbrothers.”</p><p class="double"><i>Bawk bawk?</i> Toothless tried. <i>It doesn&#039;t really fit me...</p><p class="double"></i></p><p><hr></p><p>33.2 (Caution: contains non-MLP headcanon)</p><p><hr></p><p>“Oh, thank you all for coming,” Fluttershy said quietly. “I&#039;m afraid that some of my animals have been acting... <i>very</i> strangely.”</p><p class="double">“And we all know what <i>that</i> means...” Scootaloo muttered.</p><p class="double">“Ssh,” Dash admonished her. “I kinda wanna guess <i>who</i> it is before we get told.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo nodded.</p><p class="double">“So,” Twilight said, brightly. “What alerted you?”</p><p class="double">“Well, it was two things. Mister Hedge and Mister Kiddy got into a race, and... I&#039;m afraid that I lost track of them. I don&#039;t understand it, they&#039;re normally very even tempered...”</p><p class="double">“Why do y&#039;all still give yer animals such cutesy names?” Applebloom asked. “Can&#039;t you talk to &#039;em now?”</p><p class="double">“She can,” Dash answered for her friend. “But we tend to call animals by what they&#039;re called anyway, here in Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“Huh...” Applebloom absorbed that. “Well, that explains some of those stranger fused loops...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, being a tortoise wasn&#039;t as fun as all that. Might explain why Rarity found her cat where she did, though...”</p><p class="double">“Really?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, she rescued Opalescence from a pit where she was planning to look for gems. I kinda think her gem finding spell might have locked on to the cat...”</p><p class="double">Sweetie nodded. “Now I think about it, I <i>do</i> remember that. Mom and Dad were a bit confused.” The filly then stopped, putting a hoof to her chin. “Doesn&#039;t explain why Opal&#039;s such an ungrateful, spiteful-”</p><p class="double">“Sweetie,” Twilight warned.</p><p class="double">“-Molly. What, what did you think I was going to say?” Sweetie winked.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo held up a hoof. “We may have gotten distracted. What was the other thing, Fluttershy?”</p><p class="double">“Well, the only other thing I&#039;d noticed when I left was that Snugglekins had started dismantling my dehumidifier...”</p><p class="double">For a few minutes, there was silence, as all the Loopers tried to solve the problem.</p><p class="double">“Hang on,” Dash said, frowning. “Isn&#039;t Snugglekins that fox-”</p><p class="double">“Sonic!” the Crusaders shouted at once.</p><p class="double">“I should have known!” Sweetie said, shaking her head. “Of course Mister Hedge would have to be a hedgehog!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is going to be awesome!” Applebloom enthused. “I&#039;ve wanted to meet Tails for the longest time!”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, this was a bust,” Applebloom muttered.</p><p class="double">The almost-perfectly-normal fox in front of her cocked his head, then flirted two tails (I did say <i>almost</i>) and got back to building something out of a dehumidifier, half of Fluttershy&#039;s fridge, a phonograph, and her alarm clock.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear...” Fluttershy said softly. “I should have reminded you that you can&#039;t speak with animals...”</p><p class="double">The fox licked something, pressed it onto a circuit board, then wrapped two wires together. A moment&#039;s work with a multimeter (and where that came from Applebloom wasn&#039;t sure, though she had a suspicion) and he slotted a final capacitor into place.</p><p class="double">“Okay, does this work?” asked the voice of an opera singer from Hockland.</p><p class="double">Applebloom blinked, then got it. “Cool, a translator?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” the opera singer continued, as Tails barked quietly into a small gramophone horn. “I&#039;d have been finished sooner, but my stuff in my subspace pocket is all pawprint and iris-locked, and I kind of don&#039;t have the same pawprint.”</p><p class="double">The filly thought about that for a moment, then did the mental equivalent of turning her subspace pocket upside down and shaking it to see what fell out.</p><p class="double">At least one handheld computer did, along with a soldering iron, two printed circuit boards which looked like maps of a tree&#039;s xylem, and a golden metal egg.</p><p class="double">“Whoops,” Applebloom said quickly, sweeping the egg up with a pair of tongs and dumping it back through her mane. “None of that, thank you very much.”</p><p class="double">“Can I use the computer? I mean, is it spare?” the singer asked, in what sounded like the second strangest opera ever written.</p><p class="double">“Sure, go ahead.” Applebloom pushed it over, turning the transmitter on and doing the same on her personal computer. “Not much installed on it... hey, is it weird that I&#039;m barely avoiding fangirling over you?”</p><p class="double">“Kind of...” Tails admitted. “Is it the fuzzy tail?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom promptly picked him up and hugged him.</p><p class="double">Several fox snarl-barks went unanswered, until Fluttershy raised a hoof. “Um... do you want me to translate now?”</p><p class="double">The filly blinked, shook her head, and put Tails gently down. “Sorry about that, mister Prower... the geeky-stuff kind of crossed with the fuzzies and I couldn&#039;t help myself.”</p><p class="double">“At least it&#039;s partly geek stuff...” Tails said via the translator. “Now I know why Dad gets all the girls...”</p><p class="double">“Wait, you have a dad?” Applebloom checked. “I actually didn&#039;t know. It never came up when ah was you.”</p><p class="double">“Sort of. You&#039;re familiar with my world, right? You&#039;re going to laugh...” Tails warned.</p><p class="double">“No, I&#039;m not!” Applebloom protested. “I kinda know about the whole missin&#039; parents thing...”</p><p class="double">“Well, mine isn&#039;t missing. You&#039;d know him as Dr. Ivo Robotnik.”</p><p class="double">Her jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">Tails sat back and shrugged, then went back to the gramophone horn. “I&#039;m actually kind of a genetic experiment, but Dad is Dad as far as I&#039;m concerned. You should see him on the days he&#039;s not going all mad with science, he&#039;s a nice guy.”</p><p class="double">The young fox dragged the palmtop over with a paw, and began typing as he talked. “Anyway. Yeah, that relationship predates the loops, but we kept it secret from Sonic. That&#039;s not exactly hard, you just don&#039;t tell him out loud and he never asks. Then, one day, when I was in my first time looping, he just up and told me he&#039;d found out about it twenty loops ago.”</p><p class="double">A supple shrug-like motion. “Of course, there&#039;s a major branch type for my loop which has me with a dad who gets abducted by aliens instead, or something... I can never keep it straight.”</p><p class="double">The palmtop made a <i>bing</i> noise.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s that?” Applebloom asked, interested.</p><p class="double">By way of reply, Tails yipped into the palmtop while typing. What emerged was far more like his natural voice. “Translator program I designed for handling aliens. Works for this, too.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded. “I think I see. So you got it to absorb our language via my computer&#039;s data storage, and then you&#039;re typing what you say as you say it so it can learn fox.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” Tails nodded. “I can see why you replaced me, nice work!”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well,” Braeburn said, looking into his bottle of whiskey. “Ah think this must be a li&#039;l too strong.”</p><p class="double">There wasn&#039;t really any other explanation than the whiskey for why two pegasi and two hedgehoggy... things, had just shot past his house...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">33.3</p><p><hr></p><p>“Welcome to our town, Twilight Sparkle,” the Mayor said genially.</p><p class="double">“Actually...” Twilight paused, digging in her saddlebags. “I was informed that I&#039;d be staying in the library. It looks nice, and I&#039;ve got, well, a bit of money...” she looked embarassed. “Put it this way, the most I&#039;ve spent it on in years is books. Anyway, I was wondering if it was possible to buy the library?”</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare blinked. “You want to what?”</p><p class="double">“Buy the library. Freehold.” Twilight pulled a bag out of her saddlebags, which clinked. “Here we are! I hope this is enough...”</p><p class="double">Recovering slightly, the Mayor thought it over. Especially important was the size of the bag.</p><p class="double">It <i>would</i> be nice to not be worried about the budget. “Well, if you insist...”</p><p class="double">“I do. Oh, keep the change.” Twilight passed over the bag. Mayor Mare took it, and was unable to keep her grip on it – resulting in a loud <i>thud</i> and a small crater in the ground.</p><p class="double">Both of them looked at the crater.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll fix that later,” Twilight said, blushing. “Anyway. I must be getting on, there&#039;s a bit of work I want to get done.”</p><p class="double">Fortunately, she had come prepared. All the relevant paperwork was already drawn up, filled out and signed by her last Loop – some of it was even already filed, that morning in Canterlot.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“We ought to do something about Nightmare Moon,” Applejack said.</p><p class="double">“Not my problem,” Twilight replied, kicking back on the sofa.</p><p class="double">“What?” came from several throats at once.</p><p class="double">“Well, as I see it, she&#039;s only invading Equestria, right? Not my problem.”</p><p class="double">“Er... we are <i>in</i> Equestria, darling,” Rarity pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Twilight pointed to the door. “Didn&#039;t any of you see the sign?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shot out the door, then back in again. “What does Federal Republic of Libraria mean?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Easy. I established this library, and the land around it to a distance of one fetlock, as an independent micronation. I am the President – for life – and Spike is the only other citizen.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m what?” Spike called from the other room.</p><p class="double">“Dual citizenship,” she called back.</p><p class="double">“Oh, okay then. Wait, I didn&#039;t elect you.”</p><p class="double">“The voting age in Libraria is two years more than your age, Spike,” Twilight replied. “Which leaves me as the only voter. Next election is whenever I step down.”</p><p class="double">“Awww...”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Dash shook her head, looking annoyed. “If you&#039;re going to give up like this, then we don&#039;t need you! We&#039;ll go stop Nightmare Moon by ourselves.”</p><p class="double">“Go ahead,” Twilight replied. Her horn flared as she mixed a mug of cocoa. “I&#039;d like to help, of course, but the Westfillian principle means I can&#039;t intervene in the internal affairs of other nations. This is basically a succession crisis, after all...”</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight did feel a little guilty about what happened to her friends.</p><p class="double">Just a bit.</p><p class="double">But, well, the dungeons in Canterlot Castle were frankly a bit pathetic. They just hadn&#039;t been used in a long time... and, of course, Twilight had sent a letter to Cadence about the whole thing, so the young alicorn had broken all five of them out already.</p><p class="double"><i>Right. It&#039;s about six A.M, so...</p><p class="double"></i></p><p><hr></p><p>Nightmare Moon stalked towards the brightly lit tree in the centre of Ponyville. “What treachery is this?”</p><p class="double">“Hi!” a unicorn waved from the top balcony, wearing smoked-glass shades and with a drink next to her. “Cordial greetings from the President of Libraria to the Princess of Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“Why and how do you break the Eternal Night?” Nightmare Moon asked, ignoring the comment.</p><p class="double">The unicorn grinned. “Actually, it&#039;s very interesting. See, it&#039;s a variation of a portal spell, where the portal only transmits light. I parked one end of the portal over open sea on what I suppose should be called the Dayside now, and so it lets through just enough sunlight to cover Libraria.”</p><p class="double">“Your impudence shall be punished!” Charging her horn, Nightmare Moon prepared to make an example of the insolent unicorn.</p><p class="double">“Actually, you <i>really</i> don&#039;t want to do that,” the unicorn replied, taking her sunglasses off. “Basically, if you do, then the Westfillian treaty doesn&#039;t apply any more.”</p><p class="double">The spell stopped charging.</p><p class="double">“The <i>what</i> treaty?” Nightmare Moon asked, frowning. “I know not of such a treaty.”</p><p class="double">“Essentially, it forbids interference in the internal affairs of other countries. And, since I&#039;m President Twilight Sparkle of the micronation of Libraria, that means I can&#039;t get involved in purely internal Equestrian affairs.” The unicorn – Sparkle – tossed over a scroll which Nightmare Moon caught by instinct. “Clause five, I think.”</p><p class="double">The Nightmare read it, slowly and carefully, looking for loopholes.</p><p class="double">“...I see. Well, then, there is just one problem.”</p><p class="double">“Do tell,” the &#039;President&#039; invited cheerfully.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t <i>care</i> if you get involved.” Nightmare Moon finished her spell, and fired it directly at the tree trunk.</p><p class="double">Then there was a flash of almost intolerably bright light.</p><p class="double">“Hello,” the purple alicorn standing in front of her said, as Nightmare Moon&#039;s vision returned. “I&#039;m the commander-in-chief. Also the army.”</p><p class="double">“Where did you come from?” Nightmare asked angrily.</p><p class="double">“Libraria has a system of volunteer service. All adult citizens are on the muster rolls and can be activated at any time-”</p><p class="double">“Well, then, why didn&#039;t I <i>sense</i> you?” The words were ground out through what seemed to be intense anger. “And where did your puling President go?”</p><p class="double">“Speaking,” the alicorn said. “Now, since the treaty no longer applies, I&#039;d like to ask you an important question. What is magic?”</p><p class="double">“I... <i>why?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Just curious,” the alicorn – apparently this Sparkle – said. “After all, it&#039;s sort of fundamental here.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t particularly care either to answer or what the answer is,” Nightmare said, already charging more magic.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m sure Cadence can tell us,” Sparkle said, nodding behind the Nightmare.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the oldest trick in the book!” Nightmare Moon retorted. “I am not a fool.”</p><p class="double">“Friendship is magic!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s ears sagged. “She <i>was</i> behind me, was she not?”</p><p class="double">Sparkle nodded, and then everything went rainbow.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Well, that was fairly successful,” Twilight said to herself that evening.</p><p class="double">First off, she&#039;d managed to engineer <i>Cadence</i> into being the Element of Magic. It would be interesting to see how that developed.</p><p class="double">Secondly, and much more entertainingly, the paperwork making her library into a micronation was now unassailable. And she was <i>sure</i> there was a lot of humour to be got out of that.</p><p class="double">The only downside was that, while most ponies had believed her that the alicorn was an elaborate illusion, Princess Luna was still on her case about it.</p><p class="double">Ah, well. No new loop pattern worked the first time.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>33.4 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><hr></p><p>Some Awakenings were less pleasant than others. Falling from a great height wasn&#039;t that bad, as long as the height was still great enough to cast a Levitation spell. Fight sequences generally had you so involved that your brain pretty much shunted the whole &#039;millennia of memories&#039; thing to one side until the risk of dying was less immediate. Though additional centuries of combat experience and the massive power boost usually helped.</p><p class="double">On a scale of one to ten, finding yourself in a giant white test tube with a bunch of humans in white coats and either combat androids or soldiers in advanced body armour watching you like a specimen through a large window was definitely a solid seven. Having two disks bigger than you were extruding on mechanical arms to envelop you bumped that to an eight, and the fact that they crackled with electricity made it a nine. Add to that the fact that there was some sort of suppressive field interfering with her attempts to push them away and it was probably a nine point seven.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle stabilised her telekinetic output from her reserves without upping the power to avoid a spike while she assimilated the in-loop memories. Okay, teleport accident, ended up on a n apparently human inhabited planet unconscious from a rough transit, captured by this bunch of paramilitary types. Her memories from the capture were too fuzzy to get anything like an organisation name, but it was quite clear that they&#039;d treated her as hostile from the very first. Attacked from the moment she started to move, captured, drugged and now this. Plus she ached all over. Well, if they wanted to make her an enemy, they were going about it the right way.</p><p class="double">Her force powers were almost completely suppressed, and her innate magical ability was impaired by whatever restraint mechanism they were using. She wasn&#039;t sure if alternative foci to her horn, such as her Hogwarts wand were affected, but it was clear purely technological devices were fine, and so was her sub-space pocket. Giving her surroundings a second glance, she made a mental checklist of the chain of spells she&#039;d be casting, then summoned an EMP bomb.</p><p class="double">Dr Vahlen watched dispassionately as the two electrodes closed in on the research project they&#039;d code-named Sparkle.</p><p class="double">“Load still rising,” the first operator spoke, “scaling up damping field to forty-five per cent… forty-six… forty-seven…”</p><p class="double">“Don’t let it stop the electrodes,” Vahlen commanded, “but continue to monitor the load. We need to know just how powerful this specimen is.”</p><p class="double">Suddenly the lighting flickered and died, along with the screens and the power inside the chamber. The lightning around the two probes died, and they ceased moving. The only light source was the intense purple glow haloing the subject. It flared, especially bright around the &#039;horn&#039;, and then there was a flash of white light and the subject vanished, leaving them in darkness.</p><p class="double">There were screams of panic and shock until the emergency systems cut in and the lights started to come on. The computer systems were a lot less stable, the displays flickering and cycling. The comntainment chamber was defiently empty. The Doctor overcame her shock and triggered her headset. “Case Omega, I repeat Case Omega! We have a containment breach! Subject Sparkle is loose in the base, present whereabouts unknown! Destroy it at any cost!”</p><p class="double">Captain William Walker, call-sign Viking hefted his alloy cannon, while Lieutenant Suchiro Saname, one of the Assault specialists from Strike 2 scanned the area, readying his plasma rifle. The subject had shown considerable ability at deflecting attacks, but with Dr Shen&#039;s psionic damper active, they should have at least a chance of hitting it...</p><p class="double">“Dr Vahlen!” The operator who&#039;d been monitoring the damper spoke. “The damper isn&#039;t functioning, I&#039;ve got an engineering team checking it.”</p><p class="double">He paused, looking up at her with a shocked expression. “It&#039;s wrecked, as if someone put an explosive charge in the middle of it! They&#039;re estimating several hours of work to repair it.”</p><p class="double">The blood of everyone in the lab ran cold, even Dr Vahlen&#039;s which most people believed was ice water anyway. The only equaliser they had against their ex-prisoner was gone, and it was almost certain that the subject was the one responsible, locating and acting against it in a fraction of a second.</p><p class="double">Red lights and sirens were the order of the day, as soldiers and security ran around trying to find the small purple unicorn. This was made redundant when the unicorn reappeared about a foot in front of the Doctor. She was hovering in mid-air, and had manifested wings that glowed with the same lambent violet aura as the rest of her. The small fragment of Dr Vahlen&#039;s mind that wasn&#039;t gibbering with terror noted that they were flapping too slowly to provide the necessary lift.</p><p class="double">Her world disappeared in a hail of alloy fragments and super-heated plasma as the two X-Com soldiers opened fire on the apparition. The attack should have shredded and vapourised the creature, and killed the unarmoured Dr Vahlen herself just from the effects of being on the edges of it, but it seemed to have no effect on either of them. It wasn&#039;t being deflected, simply vanishing when it got within a foot of them.</p><p class="double">It quickly stopped as the two soldiers were flung away, ending up stuck to the walls in a spread-eagled position, with their weapons hung up next to them like display pieces. From the way they were struggling they were both still alive, but unable to free themselves. Doctor Vahlen had other problems, she had tried to scramble away and found herself held gently but immovably as the creature approached.</p><p class="double">It&#039;s big eyes seemed to stare deep into her soul, while the glowing spiral horn, which had appeared so stubby and inoffensive compared to the usual run of claws and mandibles the aliens usually had, looked a lot sharper and more menacing when it was approaching your eyes.</p><p class="double">It brushed her forehead, and she got the sudden impression of a host of voices talking at once, and blurred images inside her head. Then it was over, and the creature retreated. It spoke one word in a feminine voice, then vanished.</p><p class="double">“Thank-you.”</p><p class="double">Commander Banford was still trying to co-ordinate a response to Doctor Vahlen&#039;s Case Omega when subject Sparkle appeared in the command centre, hovering in the centre of the massive holo-projection of earth that dominated it. The projection flickered and went crimson before vanishing altogether. At the same time the few soldiers and security guards who had made it there were borne to the floor, unable to rise, as was anyone who tried to raise a weapon against her.</p><p class="double">The controls for the base communications systems flashed as they opened a base wide channel and locked out further changes, then the hovering creature spoke.</p><p class="double">“I am Twilight Sparkle, protégé to Princess Celestia, the co-ruler of Equestria, student, magical researcher and astronomer. I also know who and what you are, X-Com, as I availed myself of the knowledge and memories of your Doctor Vahlen. Fortunately, unlike your own methods of memory extraction, it doesn&#039;t leave the subject a decerebrated corpse. Apart from a slight aftertaste of elderberries and a temporary decrease in mental acuity comparable to three units of alcohol, she should be back to her mean old self in a few hours.”</p><p class="double">She rolled her eyes and added, “And boy does she ever need a few units of alcohol, and a stallion... I mean, guy. Oh and a spell to lower her inhibitions, I&#039;ve been inside her head and Celestia, that mare is wound tight! I&#039;m not the most social of ponies myself, but she makes me look like Pinkie Pie! Oh, and the reason she&#039;s so into dismembering alien corpses? I think it&#039;s sublimation. Some-pony really needs professional help.”</p><p class="double">She gave a little internal grin. She might not intend to hurt any-pony, but embarrassing the person who&#039;d been quite willing to torture her into a mindless wreck and use her as a target dummy until she expired was perfectly reasonable. She cast a fascination spell with herself as the target to make sure no-pony interrupted.</p><p class="double">“I understand that you have just finished defending yourselves from an alien invasion, and that you&#039;d be naturally cautious about new alien forms, but you never even considered I might not be hostile from the very moment your goons saw me! One moment I was in my observatory in Ponyville, running a series of deep space scrying experiments, the next I ended up on earth, semi-conscious and with a massive everything ache. I could barely keep my magic under control!”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “That&#039;s what I get for using orichalcum rather than mithril to inlay the runes. But you know how it is when you&#039;re on a budget, and really, who would have expected a parametric thaumic cascade using Star Swirl&#039;s second formulation? Should have checked this system was clear of recently evaporated quantum singularities before I tried it...</p><p class="double">“Where was I? Oh yes, helpless and alone on an alien planet, in dire need of a friend and a Spa visit. So your heavy-horseshoe thugs surround me and ignore any attempt I made to communicate. Maybe I wasn&#039;t a hundred percent, but just because my horn was glowing, they didn&#039;t need to bombard me with plasma! Then there&#039;s the whole &#039;torture me into a mindless puppet and use me for target practice&#039; thing you had going. Not the best way to make friends with a representative of a new alien race.”</p><p class="double">She was about to insult them and give them a long winded description of exactly why it was a bad idea to tick off a being who could turn their base into a glowing crater, and had friends who were even more powerful, but she decided that would be too mean spirited. The engrams from that Vahlen female must be making her more aggressive than usual.</p><p class="double">No, it was a cardinal rule of both story telling and teaching to show, not tell. If she was going to troll them, she&#039;d do it pony-style, or rather Twilight style, with random acts of kindness and helping them out. After all, most of them were just trying to protect their world and loved ones, and this rather battered planet needed some major first aid. The trick would be to annoy the Tartarus out of them at the same time.</p><p class="double">“You know what, forget the lot of you! I&#039;m still mad about being experimented on, but I&#039;m not big on vengeance. I could go home right now, but I figure while I&#039;m here, I should take a look around, maybe help out a little. It&#039;s not like your planet couldn&#039;t use all the help it can get. Besides, these &#039;pina coladas&#039; and &#039;Japanese hot springs&#039; Doctor Vahlen&#039;s memories contain interest me greatly. I&#039;ll just pop off a message home telling them what happened, and that I&#039;m going to be home late. Bye bye!”</p><p class="double">She vanished, which broke the spell the watchers were under. It was almost five seconds later that the yelling started.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Casa Manyana wasn&#039;t one of Rio&#039;s most notable drinking establishments. However, Rio, being Rio, especially as even an alien invasion hadn&#039;t stopped the Mardi Gras, it wasn’t unused to unusual sights. A purple alicorn flashing into existence in the middle of the dance floor and making her way to the bar was at least in the top ten.</p><p class="double">Nobody actually moved to try and stop her, partly because she was something of an outside context problem for most of the denizens, and partly because most of them were still trying to decide whether she was real, or just some problem of their own. A few gentle touches of telekinesis to give her a clear path, and a manifested set of steps to bring her level with the bar, and she was facing one of the bar staff.</p><p class="double">“One pina colada please.” The barman looked at her blankly. Twilight face-hooved. Brazil, different language. She hadn&#039;t needed Vahlen&#039;s engrams for the language, English and Equestrian seemed to be interchangeable, but none of her previous loops had given her Portuguese. She cast a universal translation spell.</p><p class="double">“One pina colada please.” The man was still frozen. “C&#039;mon! I&#039;ve been involuntarily teleported halfway across the galaxy, been captured by a secret military organisation, been experimented on, undergone an involuntary evolution into my races most super-powered form, escaped a heavily fortified underground installation, and right now I need a freaking drink!”</p><p class="double">That finally seemed to break the paralysis. Maybe it was the fact her wings flared and her horn had started to glow. “Yes, right away! Do you want a glass or a pitcher?”</p><p class="double">“You do pitchers? I like this planet!” Twilight said brightly. “Yes please!”</p><p class="double">The inanity of the task of making the cocktail calmed him down, and nobody else was willing to prod the purple alien to see what it might do to anyone who interrupted it&#039;s quest for alcohol. He turned back with the pitcher and said automatically, “That will be twenty five reals.”</p><p class="double">He blanched as he suddenly realised what he&#039;d said, but before he could stammer an apology Twilight twitched her head, and a golden coin landed on the counter. “I don&#039;t have any local currency yet, but this coin from my home world is over an ounce of 95 percent pure gold. I&#039;m certain it&#039;s worth several times the value of that drink, even after an exchange fee. Would that be acceptable?”</p><p class="double">Since it was at least a hundred times the value of the drink he had no trouble in agreeing.</p><p class="double">“Great! Keep the change. Oh, could I have some of those little paper umbrellas in it. I understand they&#039;re necessary for the full experience.”</p><p class="double">He added the umbrellas, and found three more coins on the counter. “Oh, and would this be enough to buy the other people here a drink? Just because I&#039;m having a bad day doesn&#039;t mean I want to wish one on any-pony else.”</p><p class="double">It was, easily, and he only hesitated for a brief second to decide not to ask for more. He was already well ahead of the game on the first coin, and given what he&#039;d seen her do when she was in a good mood, he didn&#039;t want to risk what she might do if she found out later that he&#039;d overcharged her. The other bar patrons were cheering. A purple alicorn might be outside their frame of reference, but someone buying them drinks was well inside it, and definitely counted as a friend.</p><p class="double">The purple alicorn in question gave the barman another nod and a pleased smile, levitated the jug with a halo of purple energy, and flashed away as abruptly as she&#039;d appeared. A few seconds later the steps dissolved in a shower of sparkles that faded away to nothing.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile in Japan, a receptionist at a secluded onsen was having difficulty maintaining a suitable level of imperturbability. Part of her was scared of the alien creature that had appeared in the foyer of the hot springs bath towing a jug of something with no visible means of support, while the little girl part of her had taken one look at the adorable purple unicorn with wings and had the deep desire to jump over the counter squealing &#039;Kawaiii!&#039; and hug her.</p><p class="double">“Please could I get a private room, and do you have room service? I&#039;d like a vegetarian sushi selection. And of course, access to the baths. And, most of all, discretion.” Twilight didn&#039;t need a translation spell here. She&#039;d had plenty of loops that had taken her to Japanese or equivalent language settings. She pulled a bag from her subspace pocket and set it on the counter, open enough to show the mass of gold coins and gemstones within. “I believe can pay.”</p><p class="double">Politeness and large sums of gold were acceptable currency anywhere, and Japan was no exception. “I will get the manager. I&#039;m sure he will be happy to see to your needs personally.”</p><p class="double">Twilight levitated a flawless ruby the size of her thumb out of the bag, and placed it in front of her. “Excellent. Thank you for your assistance.”</p><p class="double">She had her drink, a place to stay and get cleaned up, and now she could start to plan...</p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>33.5 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p><u><b>Ponyville Unconventional</b></u></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>“So what do we do about the Foal Free Press?” Apple Bloom asked her Awake crusader buddies.</p><p class="double">“Do we have to do anything?” Sweetie Belle squeaked, looking surprised.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shook her head. “Never gonna do that Gabby Gums thing again. Rainbow Dash took weeks to warm up to me again. Hurting any-pony with gossip like that is just plain wrong.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom looked thoughtful as she paced around the Treehouse. “Of course you&#039;re right, I don&#039;t want to hurt any-pony, but you&#039;ve gotta admit Gabby Gums made ponies sit up and listen. None of us has a cutie-mark talent for writing, unless you count the way Sweetie pulls song lyrics out of the air, but somehow we managed to make it work anyway.</p><p class="double">“I just figure we could do something better than point out that Princess Celestia likes cake. Plus we can even put one over on Diamond Tiara in all her regular snarky, petty tin god minded glory. Why can&#039;t that filly pony on up and stop acting like a spoiled brat? We know she&#039;s better than that, or can be. Maybe by showing her how to help ponies rather than just making fun of them, we can get her to do just that.”</p><p class="double">“What do you have in mind?” Sweetie Belle followed her friend with her eyes.</p><p class="double">“Well, every-pony like to discuss things over an apple juice or something. Let&#039;s give them something to debate. I&#039;ve even got the perfect first topic, assuming Snips and Snails are their usual selves.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“&#039;Snips and Snails in Bubblegum Veils&#039;? I didn&#039;t think the three of you would produce anything usable, but it looks like I was wrong.” Diamond Tiara said grudgingly. “The picture sells it. Ponies always like to see some-pony else being embarrassed. And calling yourselves Gabby Gums, that should help give it some mystery.”</p><p class="double">“Uh, DT... I mean, Miss Editor-in-Chief, ma&#039;am...” Apple Bloom corrected herself as the tiara wearing pony gave her a nasty glare. “That ain&#039;t the whole of it. Look below the fold.”</p><p class="double">“&#039;Right or Wrong – Laughing at some-ponies misfortune is mean.&#039; What is this...” She read through the copy. “... everybody does it... ponies should learn to take a joke... even if it may not seem serious to you, maybe it is to the pony your laughing at... turn the tables, remember something that happened to you and imagine ponies laughing at it... A debate piece? Actually... this is quite good stuff.”</p><p class="double">“We figure we&#039;ll haul the ponies in with the first half, get &#039;em laughing, then buck &#039;em in the face with the question if what they&#039;re doing is right.” Apple Bloom explained.</p><p class="double">“Ponies have all sorts of opinions.” Sweetie Belle added, “Rarity loves to gossip and talk about stuff around town. When she reads this, whether she agrees or not, she will talk about it, and that will get other ponies talking...”</p><p class="double">“And all of them will want copies of the Foal Free Press!” Diamond Tiara finished. “Ha ha ha! It&#039;s brilliant! I&#039;m glad I thought of it... Wait, do you think you can do this again? We need controversy, things ponies can argue about.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t you worry, Chief,” Scootaloo piped up. “We&#039;ve got lots of ideas.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sister, this is intolerable!” Princess Luna stormed into her elder sisters rooms shortly after moon-rise. “We must beagle out the identity of this Gabby Gums is and punish her for her insolence!”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia noticed the papers held crumpled in her sister&#039;s telekinesis and shook her head. “I have to admit, that picture of me sampling the cakes for the Royal Canterlot Bakery Auction wasn&#039;t my most flattering, but I believe I can survive a little fun at my expense.”</p><p class="double">“But... &#039;Celestia – Just like us&#039;? That alone would be bad enough, but this second heading, &#039;Right or Wrong – Is the Diarchy the best way of ruling Equestria&#039;. Tis treason!”</p><p class="double">“Calm yourself Luna.” Princess Celestia gently unfolded the paper. “Have you read it through? This Gabby Gums wasn&#039;t questioning our fitness to rule, she was discussing flaws in the system itself. She actually makes some good points. If anything she is sympathetic to us. She highlights the point that we alone raise the sun and moon, and how that prevents us from taking a holiday, or how if something happened to both of us, how much of a disaster that would be. She even makes the point that you don&#039;t get as much exposure as I do, running the Night Court. You are my younger sister, but you should be my equal in authority. I am giving serious thought to the suggestion she made that we trade off duties. I raised the moon for a thousand years, and I know you could raise the sun. That way you would finally get the respect you deserve.”</p><p class="double">“Sister!” Luna exclaimed, then teared up slightly. “You mean it?”</p><p class="double">“I do. I should have thought of it myself, but my first though was to protect you.” Celestia hugged her sibling. “But most of all, she talks about us as ponies first, rather than princesses. Maybe if more ponies had seen us, seen you that way a thousand years ago and considered even an immortal princess might have hurt feelings, things might have turned out differently.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Have you seen the latest Gabby Gums?” Rainbow Dash asked, as she entered Rarity&#039;s shop.</p><p class="double">“My dear, I read all of Gabby Gums articles.” the fashionista replied as she annealed a gem into place on her latest ensemble. “I assume you&#039;re referring to the one entitled, &#039;Rainbow Dash – Super Speedster or Super Girly&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I don&#039;t know how they got the picture from when I was with you at the Spa. Was I ever steamed when saw that!”</p><p class="double">“Then you read the Right or Wrong piece, am I right?” Rarity smiled.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that kinda put things into perspective. I guess if I can read Daring Doo books without being any less awesome for it, I can get my hooves done too. After all, if I want to look the best for my fans, I&#039;ve gotta take care of myself right? Of course, seeing you were in it too...”</p><p class="double">“I rather liked the tag line, &#039;Can&#039;t a pony be both?&#039;. I don&#039;t know how Gabby Gums learned about my little contretemps with those Diamond Dogs, but it was actually rather flattering to be called a &#039;mare of action&#039; as well as a top fashion designer. It&#039;s like this Gabby Gums knows us both personally.”</p><p class="double">“You think it&#039;s Twilight? After all, she&#039;s always writing reports about everything under the sun. Which reminds me, I can&#039;t believe Princess Luna is subbing for Celestia at that.”</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s a wonderful idea myself, doing the same job for thousands of years must get pretty dull. And Nightmare Night showed Princess Luna needed to get out more.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, you don&#039;t really think of the Princesses as ponies, but they eat cake too I guess. So, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Rarity shook her head. “I wouldn&#039;t have thought she&#039;d write a piece like that about the Princesses, or send a copy of the paper to them afterwards. But I can&#039;t think of any-pony else. I asked Sweetie Belle but she said she&#039;s sworn to secrecy. Actually, I&#039;m meeting up with Fluttershy for another Spa session after I finish this dress. Shall we invite Twilight and see what we can find out?”</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Dash hesitated for a second, then gave a decisive nod. “Okay, and if any-pony gives me a hard time, I&#039;ll buck &#039;em to the curb! For that matter, you can help me, Miss &#039;mare of action&#039;.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I gotta admit, I was plumb furious when I read that headline.” Applejack looked around the breakfast table at her assembled family over an open paper. “I should have figured it was another one of those Gabby Gums tricks. &#039;Applejack – Asleep on the job.&#039; Of course I was resting, I&#039;d just finished bucking the entire South Forty.”</p><p class="double">“Well they did say just that.” Big Mac replied. “Never figured they&#039;d interview a cow to prove it.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom suppressed a smirk and said. “We don&#039;t often talk to the cows on anything, and we&#039;re the ones who maintain their barn!”</p><p class="double">“I figure that was the point sugarcube.” Applejack replied. “It was all a lead into this whole piece about how non-pony races are treated. At least Sweet Apple Acres came out of it looking good.”</p><p class="double">Granny Smith stirred in her rocking chair. “And so we should! I helped my paw talk the Buttercup herd into sticking around Ponyville back in the day. Cows ain&#039;t ponies, they do things their own way, and we ponies better respect that. They like living together, birthing their own calves, and having a secure range to graze on. That&#039;s what we promised &#039;em and that&#039;s what they got. We take care of &#039;em and that includes leavin&#039; them to their own devices.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, it wasn&#039;t just about cows, why do we even say &#039;stubborn as a mule&#039; when old Forest Gumption is as easy going a fellow as any-pony could ask for. Good solid worker too. Or why they only allow ponies in the Royal guard, and that how that whole thing with Zecora happened. She asks some uncomfortable questions, but I guess that&#039;s what makes her popular.”</p><p class="double">“Time some-pony did.” Big Mac was clearly in a chatty mood. “Reckon if no-pony asks if something is wrong, ponies are going to end up thinking it&#039;s right, or not thinking at all!”</p><p class="double">“What I want to know is how this Gabby Gums mare managed to interview them heifers in the first place.” Applejack turned to look at Apple Bloom, who was adding another scoop of chopped apple and honey to her oatmeal. “Bloom, you work on the paper, you must know her. For that matter, you were fixing the plumbing in the cow&#039;s barn yesterday afternoon, was that when she came to visit?”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. “Sorry sis, I made a promise not to tell any-pony. Diamond Tiara won&#039;t let us.”</p><p class="double">Applejack frowned. “That Diamond Tiara&#039;s playing you for a fool. She hasn&#039;t put a single piece by you in the paper, or your friends either.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay sis, there&#039;s more to life than getting your name in the by-line. They need all the help they can get just getting out more copies. We&#039;re delivering to news stands in Canterlot, Trottingham, even Manehattan! We may not get a cutie-mark out of it, but we&#039;re having fun, and ain&#039;t that the important thing?”</p><p class="double">Applejack glowered, not at the filly but at some unseen point in the distance. “I figured that whole business with the cute-caneara was just some silly filly boasting about getting her mark, but the more I hear about her, the less I like. If she gives you trouble, y&#039;all just tell me, y&#039;hear?”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned. “It&#039;s okay sis, we&#039;ve got it under control.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara was livid, and staring down the subjects of her ire from over the top of her desk.</p><p class="double">“Did you really think you&#039;d get away with this? I do read what goes in the paper, your column most of all. This piece about cutie-marks, it&#039;s practically propaganda for your stupid little club! Not to mention the way you make ponies who have an actual gift the bad guys!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s not what it says at all!” Apple Bloom protested. “It&#039;s just saying that while cutie-marks are good, there&#039;s more to a pony than their cutie-mark talent, and that they shouldn&#039;t be bullied about not having a mark. My cousin Babs is having a hard time with bullies at her school, and we reckoned she might not be the only one.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle added her two bits. “We just wanted to let fillies and colts like that know they aren&#039;t alone. Maybe we can even get some grown up ponies to remember how they felt about being bullied about being a blank flank, and even do something to help the foals who are.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, this isn&#039;t about you!” Scootaloo exclaimed. “Your lame attempts at nastiness barely even count as annoying! There are ponies out there who are really hurting!”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t care who&#039;s hurting! You will write something different for your next Gabby Gums piece, or I&#039;ll write my own story, using these! I told Featherweight to photograph everything, and he did!”</p><p class="double">The three of them knew exactly what the pictures showed, Sweetie Belle as a dressmakers dummy, one of Scootaloo&#039;s more spectacular nose dives, and baby Apple Bloom with a pair of diapers on her head. However, they pretended to be appropriately shocked. Featherweight was even visible up in the skylight taking another snap.</p><p class="double">“Hey! Give us those!” Scootaloo reached for the photos, only to have them swiped away and put back in an envelope. Diamond Tiara gave a nasty smirk. “Sorry girls, property of the Foal Free Press... just like Gabby Gums. Now get out there and write!”</p><p class="double">The three fillies trailed out, tails between their legs, heads down, and but with looks that were determined rather than defeated. They&#039;d given her a shot at playing fair, now the horse-shoes went on. Diamond Tiara might think she held all the cards, but they had an ace in the hole.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara came down to breakfast feeling on top of the world. Her brilliant scheme had utterly crushed those three losers. They would continue to produce Gabby Gums columns, starting with tomorrow&#039;s and she would get the credit for it. A win-win situation, as her father liked to call it, and both sides winning were Diamond Tiara.</p><p class="double">She found her father engrossed in the Canterlot Sun Chronicle over the remains of his own breakfast. He lowered the paper to look at her when he heard her enter the room, and that was when she realised something was wrong. His normal fond smile was replaced by a frown.</p><p class="double">“Diamond, what have you been doing at the school newspaper of yours?” he asked her.</p><p class="double">“Pushing it&#039;s circulation through the roof!” she replied, “More is better, you always say.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m fairly certain I didn&#039;t tell you to do this.” He hoofed over the paper. There on the front page were the three &#039;blackmail&#039; pictures she&#039;d used, and a fourth one of her confronting the three fillies in the newspaper office. While you couldn&#039;t see the pictures in detail, you could see three photos scattered on the desk, and it didn&#039;t take a genius to make the connection, especially with everyone&#039;s expressions.</p><p class="double">The headline was, “Editorial or Dictatorial&#039; with a sub heading &#039;When good stories get censored for bad reasons.&#039; and Gabby Gums as the tag line. There was also a note from the Sun Chronicle editor.</p><p class="double">&#039;Gabby Gums is no longer associated with the Foal Free Press, as the story below will relate. We are happy to announce that this is the first of many that will appear in the Chronicle.&#039;</p><p class="double">“Why those little ingrates!” Diamond Tiara raged, “I&#039;ll destroy them! I&#039;ll humiliate them so badly they&#039;ll have to go hide in Zebrica to escape the shame!”</p><p class="double">“With those pictures?” Her father asked sternly, and she suddenly realised he was listening.</p><p class="double">“But daddy, Gabby Gums is my bread and butter! They work for me, and they should do whatever I tell them to!”</p><p class="double">“Apparently not. I suggest you read the article.” She did as he told her, cheeks reddening.</p><p class="double">&#039;You may be wondering why the first three pictures above aren&#039;t accompanied by a snappy commentary and a Right or Wrong follow-up. That&#039;s because of who the three fillies shown here are. Individually we are Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom of Ponyville. Together we are the writing team that uses the pseudonym Gabby Gums.</p><p class="double">It started out as a bit of fun, but we found ponies were actually listening to us. It was awesome, so we used our column to comment on things we saw around us, questions we thought needed asking. As Apple Bloom&#039;s big brother once said, “If no-pony asks if something is wrong, soon every-pony will start thinking it&#039;s right, or not thinking at all.” We might not have gotten on with our Editor-in-Chief, but as long as we were helping to ship newspapers everything was fine.</p><p class="double">Then we wrote our latest column, and she decided she didn&#039;t like it. Not because it was poorly written or badly thought out, but purely on the basis that she believed it reflected badly on her. She ordered us to write something else, and backed it up with the pictures you see above. If we didn&#039;t fill her column inches with our writing, she&#039;d fill it with us, and a write-up designed to humiliate us. Her parting words were that she owned Gabby Gums. However, we&#039;d long since decided that Gabby Gums and getting out the truth was more important than even our individual reputations.</p><p class="double">She thought she had the whip hoof, as she had the only prints and controlled what went into the Foal Free Press. What she didn&#039;t know was that the photographer she&#039;d browbeaten into helping her still had the negatives, and that we&#039;d made contacts with other papers against the possibility that something like this would happen. She may think she owned our work, but we never signed a contract or were ever paid (any money we receive for future columns will be donated to charity).</p><p class="double">As far as we&#039;re concerned, she can publish her photos, and do her worst. The three of us would far rather be remembered as silly fillies for being caught on camera doing something embarrassing than for knuckling under to bullying tactics. We&#039;ll take whatever lumps are coming, we just ask that every-pony remember our very first column.</p><p class="double">As to the piece that caused this ruckus, or possibly even fracas, there isn&#039;t enough room left to publish it. Look for it in our next Gabby Gums column, now appearing in the Canterlot Sun Chronicle, the Baltimare Gazette and the Manehatten Times. We hope for your continued support. Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, writing as Gabby Gums.&#039;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s scream of rage could be heard in Canterlot. </p><p><hr></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>34.1 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><b><hr></b></p><p class="double"><b>Clone Mayhem</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, what have you done?!&quot;</p><p class="double">It was at six in the morning when Celestia teleported outside the Ponyville Library after receiving an urgent request for help from Spike. She had just raised the sun when the scroll begging for her immediate help appeared in a green fire. As soon as she appeared, the problem became apparent immediately. Two ponies stood inside the doorframe, both of their ears drooping against the sides of their heads.</p><p class="double">Oh, and both of them were Twilight Sparkle. The left one&#039;s ears raised as she spoke, &quot;Well...a couple months ago, I was doing some cleaning-&quot;</p><p class="double">The right Sparkle looked at her with a dirty expression, &quot;Wait, I was the one doing the cleaning and I&#039;m the original-&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia stamped her hoof, &quot;It doesn&#039;t matter at the moment. Please continue,&quot; she pointed her hoof at the left Twilight. The pony nodded, &quot;As I said, I, we, were dusting the bookshelves. As we passed the scroll wing of the library, we came across a number of scroll written in a language we had never seen before. We pulled it out and tried performing a translation spell. To our surprise, it didn&#039;t work, or at least, it didn&#039;t translate into Basic Equis!&quot;</p><p class="double">The Twilight on the right lit her horn as a scroll issued from within the library. Celestia took it with her own magic and unfurled it. It was a list of sorts as far as she could tell. Sure enough though, it was in a language she could couldn&#039;t read with words such as &#039;katon&#039; or &#039;ninjutsu&#039;. In addition, it also had pictures of ponies performing magic of some sort. The Twilight on the right continued from the one on the left, &quot;So, part of our project was to translate the words to Equis. We haven&#039;t made much progress on that front.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Twilight on the left shoved the one on the right over, &quot;The other part was performing the magic depicted on the images in front of us. We tried the first,&quot; she said, pointing to the image of one pony becoming two ponies. The foreign language over the picture said:</p><p class="double"><i>Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu</i></p><p class="double">She continued. &quot;And it worked really well! Unfortunately, we don&#039;t quite know how to end the spell. We tried the failsafe spell, and it didn&#039;t quite work.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia sighed, &quot;Twilight, you could have come to me immediately and I would have assisted you in this research. I&#039;m over a thousand years old after all, and have seen many a nation rise and fall. Perhaps if we had researched it together, I could have found some historic records of a civilization like this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pointed at the two of them, &quot;But then, you tried a spell you&#039;ve never heard of before and without knowing the consequences. It could have caused you to blow up for all you know when it made a copy of the pony in the picture.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia gave a stern look, causing both Twilights to drop their heads in shame, both saying together, &quot;We&#039;re sorry, princess...we didn&#039;t think that through all the way. After a moment passed, Celestia&#039;s stern expression faded into a sad smile. She trotted over and hugged one student, then the other, &quot;But you&#039;re alright, and we&#039;ll get through this together.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, the sound of Spike shouting from inside the library caused all of them to look to the entrance, &quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a good idea, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Another voice sounding suspiciously like Twilight&#039;s own echoed from within, &quot;But you just heard the princess. She&#039;ll be able to help us!&quot;</p><p class="double">The Twilight on the right, indeed the original Twilight, started sweating when Celestia&#039;s confused look turned towards the two standing outside, &quot;Well..uh...the thing is...the spell didn&#039;t...quite go according to plan...you see...&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike&#039;s voice echoed again, &quot;No, stay back! All of you! NO! Put me down Twilights!&quot;</p><p class="double">No less than 60 Twilights barrelled out the door with Spike held in one of their auras. Celestia&#039;s face was now in shock. The original continued, &quot;...There may have been an...accident in the magical release...and I may have produced...a few hundred...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eyes gazed over the mass of Twilights as more continued the pour out of the library. Her eyes began twitching as a moment later as her students surrounded her and started speaking at once. As result, she took the only logical action to preserve her sanity and passed out. Silence descended as the Twilights looked on in horror. Then one of the Twilights slapped the original in the back of the head, &quot;Nice going Boss! Now how are we going to explain this to all of Ponyville when they wake up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike maintained his horrified expression for a moment longer, then started chuckling, then laughing, then outright rolling on the floor roaring in amusement as tears poured down his cheeks. Moments later, the dragon shifted from Spike to Discord, &quot;Oh, I haven&#039;t had that much fun in years. Give my thanks to Naruto for teaching you how to do the Shadow Clone technique with your horn only!&quot;</p><p class="double">The original sighed, &quot;Not quite what I had in mind. I meant to have her speechless, not unconscious.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.2</p><p class="double">“...so,” Luna said, holding a bedside lamp. “What does this do?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a lamp, Luna,” Celestia answered kindly. “It makes light through electricity.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, a thunder stone!” Luna nodded. “I see! Well, I know how to work <i>these!”</i></p><p class="double">Celestia was thinking hard. <i>Thunder stone... thunder stone... oh, no!</i> “Luna, wait-”</p><p class="double">Luna quite deliberately dropped the lamp, which hit the floor with a <i>bang</i>. The glass shattered.</p><p class="double">“...because it&#039;s not a thunder stone,” Celestia continued. “It uses electricity which is generated at a dam, and then transmitted by cable to the palace and then to the lamp. You make it work by pressing the switch.”</p><p class="double">“...oh.” Luna hung her head. “My apologies, sister.”</p><p class="double">“Whaa-taa!”</p><p class="double">Both alicorns looked up. “What was that?”</p><p class="double">A cloud of black smoke puffed out from the fireplace, making them both cough.</p><p class="double">“I am, ninja!” somepony shouted, then there was a series of <i>whoosh</i> noises.</p><p class="double">When they had ended, the smoke had gone, there was no sign of soot on the floor or furnishings, and the lamp was neatly reassembled on the dresser.</p><p class="double">Celestia reached up to her ear, which was suddenly itching, and found a black card there. Words in white read:</p><p class="double"><i>Random acts of kindness a speciality!</i></p><p class="double">“...well,” she said, showing Luna the card. “I don&#039;t know about you, Lulu, but I&#039;m not complaining.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Haiii-ya!”</p><p class="double">Cranky Doodle Donkey blinked, and was somewhere else. In fact, he was in a dining room, with a table set for two.</p><p class="double">“What was that?” a voice asked, and-</p><p class="double">Matilda came in through the door, stopped, and put her hoof to her mouth. “Oh!”</p><p class="double">Cranky shrugged. “Don&#039;t know how it happened, but...”</p><p class="double">A black card fluttered to the floor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, this is a new thing for you?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Pinkie nodded, her black outfit somewhat obscuring her identity. (The voice was still obvious, though.)</p><p class="double">“Random acts of kindness, huh? I can see it working. Do you advertise?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked at her like she was an idiot. “No, silly. Ninjas work in shadows!”</p><p class="double">“Which explains the black paper over all your windows, I see...” Twilight nodded absently. “You hiring?”</p><p class="double">“Nope!” Pinkie shook her head. “The fewer ninjas, the better! I can get three times as much work done alone as I could if I had an assistant!” She dug in her subspace pocket. “Oh, hey, I made these!”</p><p class="double">Twilight examined it. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Joke bomb! Like a smoke bomb, but laughing gas. I&#039;ve only tested it once, though, and it didn&#039;t work out like I hoped...”</p><p class="double">“Not surprised...” Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">“It did make Trixie&#039;s show a success, though, so she&#039;s hired me as the opening act.” Pinkie shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Isn&#039;t that a bit unethical?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, she just wants me to gas her. Loads of pratfalls, basically.” Pinkie grinned. “She said it would stink of defeat, were the stink not obscured by the smell of so much money.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a direct quote?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Well, suppose if she&#039;s happy then that&#039;s all to the good. Happy unicorns don&#039;t try to take over Ponyville.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.3</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up. For some reason, this loop, she was an absolutely <i>tiny</i> unicorn – barely a half centimetre tall – but the world itself was fairly interesting. If built for normally sized humans.</p><p class="double">The sky looked marvellous, right now, with the young moon rising into the heavens, and Twilight worked busily on her sketchpad. (She had one this loop, and had decided to keep it up as a hobby. Perhaps it would, one day, let her get a cutie mark that wasn&#039;t the star of magic <i>again.)</i></p><p class="double">Then came the peal of a mighty bell, and the calm air went straight into a screaming, howling storm.</p><p class="double">Twilight was far too small to stay on the ground in that kind of wind. Startled, she went flying, and bounced off a shrine underneath a peach tree. (Fortunately, she ended up out of the wind, and a moment&#039;s work with magic got her pinned down properly.)</p><p class="double">Thus safe, she looked at the shrine...</p><p class="double">Which moved.</p><p class="double">A white alicorn shook her head, bits of stone falling all around her, and turned towards her.</p><p class="double">“Wait,” Twilight said, squinting. “Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, hello, Twilight, I didn&#039;t see you there,” Celestia said, waving a hoof. “I appear to... well, have more or less the same job as normal.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, levitating herself up to eye level with a mage&#039;s blithe disdain for a mere storm. “I see. Does this mean I&#039;m your sidekick?”</p><p class="double">“Probably.” Celestia shrugged, looking herself over. “Well, that&#039;s neat. I like the tufts in my coat... not sure about the black tail tip, though.” She twisted to get a better look at it. “Whoops!”</p><p class="double">The sun came up.</p><p class="double">“...do that again,” Twilight said, blinking.</p><p class="double">The sun came up again, briefly dipping below the horizon only to come up once more. </p><p class="double">“Actually, this is a lot easier than the way I normally do it,” Celestia commented. “I approve.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight hovered over, and took up a seat just behind Celestia&#039;s horn.</p><p class="double">“Are you going to stay there the whole time?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m not going to walk,” Twilight countered.</p><p class="double">“Very well, then. Let us see what this loop is about.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Spike said, handing over a large scroll. “I don&#039;t understand how this works myself, but basically now you can repair things with ink from your tail.”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. “That will be useful. I like the look, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know...” Twilight said critically. “Might be a bit too long and thin for my taste...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you going to help at <i>any</i> point?” Celestia asked, with perhaps a trace of irritation, as she swung a magic mirror like a bludgeon at two imps with guitars.</p><p class="double">Twilight kicked back, hooves wrapped in Celestia&#039;s mane. “I could provide vocals.”</p><p class="double">“I meant help <i>me.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Twilight considered it. “Not especially, no.”</p><p class="double">“...this is payback for the whole Sombra thing, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” the alicorn of the sun muttered. “Giant robot run by a fish. What to do now...”</p><p class="double">Twilight bounced on her head. “Summon the brush goddess of Bloom.”</p><p class="double">“Are you sure?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">Her inky tail moving in a single, precise circle, Celestia called on the magic native to this loop...</p><p class="double">And Fluttershy materialized on the battle field.</p><p class="double">Her eyes narrowed.</p><p class="double">“Mister fishy! You are a bad fish!”</p><p class="double">The whole giant robot of Yami flinched.</p><p class="double">“Okay, now the one for Power Slash.”</p><p class="double">Another flare of magic, and Gilda appeared.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Gilda?” Twilight shouted. “Fancy a fish dinner?”</p><p class="double">The aquiline predator perked up. “Buck yeah!”</p><p class="double">Yami looked from pegasus to griffin (the latter of whom was carrying a very large knife and a napkin)... and jumped off the platform.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not escaping that easily!” Gilda shouted, jumping off after it.</p><p class="double">Celestia and Fluttershy trotted to the edge, and peered down after them.</p><p class="double">“So...” Fluttershy said, after a moment. “Is that it?”</p><p class="double">“I assume so,” Twilight said. “Except for trying to paint an advert on the moon. Now <i>that</i> would restore faith in, er, you.”</p><p class="double">“I may need Luna&#039;s permission...” Celestia mused.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, we&#039;ve been friends for many loops now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn sipped her tea, giving her former teacher a polite, but confused look. &quot;I sense this is going somewhere...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Celestia sighed. &quot;Yes. It&#039;s nothing personal, just... a habit that irks me a bit. I&#039;ve lived with it for a while, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Twilight put her teacup down. &quot;If I&#039;m doing anything to make you uncomfortable, you can tell me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...it&#039;s really rather silly, and it&#039;s not really your fault – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia, don&#039;t make me break out the p-word.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a small laugh out of the alicorn. &quot;You&#039;d really do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. &quot;You&#039;re dancing around the subject, what works works.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...alright.&quot; Setting down her tea and taking a deep breath, the former mentor looked her former student in the eye. &quot;I want you to stop swearing by me.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a quiet moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;....that&#039;s it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to herself. &quot;Huh. Okay. Okay, sure, I&#039;ll... I&#039;ll try – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Also, could you pass the message on to the other loopers? It really is nothing personal, but when you can&#039;t tell if &#039;dear sweet YourOwnName&#039; is an expression of affection it tends to get on your nerves after a while.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, wow. Yeah, I get where you&#039;re coming from, all the Sister loops I did – &quot; The unicorn shook her head. &quot;Wow, I never even thought about it. It was just an unconscious habit. I&#039;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s fine. You didn&#039;t know.&quot;</p><p class="double">They sat amicably for a little while longer.</p><p class="double">&quot;...you know, we&#039;re still going to need to swear occasionally,&quot; Twilight pointed out. &quot;That might cause a bit of a problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Swear by trees,&quot; Celestia suggested. &quot;They&#039;re fairly reliable.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.5</p><p class="double">“Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned, already feeling tired. “What have you rigged to explode this time?”</p><p class="double">Trixie paused, then took out some notes and scribbled on them. “Nothing. Now, if you will excuse me, I need to go replace some hydrogen with helium. If something catches fire, please shout about &#039;oh, the equanity&#039; before coming to help.”</p><p class="double">With that, the blue unicorn left – not quite at a run.</p><p class="double">“Zeppelin?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“I think so,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“Right.”</p><p class="double">“You know what?” Twilight said, not precisely to Spike. “I think I&#039;m going to go get her productively employed on something. Preferably a long way off...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“A moon shot?” Trixie said, looking at the project proposal. “Very interesting, Twilight. Yes, I think this should be a good long term project. Should I work from Apple-loosa, or the Frozen North?”</p><p class="double">“Apple-loosa makes more sense.” Twilight pointed. “You&#039;d have the rail line. Though perhaps set up an day&#039;s canter or so away from any of the actual population centres, since keeping a buffalo tribe and a town-full of pioneers awake at night might not go well. Just put in a spur line, or something.”</p><p class="double">“That is true.” Trixie nodded. “Very well, I shall begin at once!”</p><p class="double">A flash of light, and she was gone.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s dealt with her for a few dozen loops...” Twilight said, then looked upwards with a frown. “Now, what do I do with this Zeppelin?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie trotted happily around her new work site. “Everything is in place! Fuel, launch bunker, control room... all that is needed is the rocket.”</p><p class="double">Picking up some sheet steel in her magical grip, she started an arc-welding spell.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Good enough,” the blue unicorn pronounced. “Now, where&#039;s that tritium...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie carefully wired up the last contact on her control board.</p><p class="double">“Done! Now, can everyone clear the launch area.”</p><p class="double">She chuckled at her own joke. She was the only pony in a hundred miles.</p><p class="double">“Launch in five, four, three, two, one-”</p><p class="double">Trixie hit the firing contact, and nearly tripped over a log on the road. Her wagon behind her didn&#039;t stop as quickly as she did, requiring two awkward half-steps and a skid to stop it overrunning her.</p><p class="double"><i>Hold on a minute...</i> she thought. <i>Where&#039;s the launch pad gone?</i></p><p class="double">A purple flash lit the wooded road in front of her. “Trixie! Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“Fine, thank you, Twilight,” Trixie replied, still frowning. “But someone has stolen my entire launch range.”</p><p class="double">The other unicorn shook her head. “Okay, clearly it all happened too fast. Whatever possessed you to use grav-pinch <i>tritium?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well, Trixie read a very interesting proposal for a project &#039;Orion&#039;, but it used weapons that were far too dirty. So she rebuilt it to use clean fusion weapons...”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “Ce-<i>Tree</i> damnit, you&#039;re myopic sometimes. Project Orion was designed for out-of-atmosphere propulsion, not liftoff!”</p><p class="double">“...oh.” Trixie paused. “So you have been checking for me ever since I blew myself off the face of Equestria?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight replied. “And next time, stick to chemistry. In fact, if you ever start getting involved in nuclear physics again, I may extract a Pinkie Promise.”</p><p class="double">Trixie shuddered. “Understood.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.6</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny kicked the spinner, managing somehow to convey total and utter disdain for all of equinity.</p><p class="double">Quite an erudite rabbit, really.</p><p class="double">“Green,” Fluttershy read off, and moved her left fore hoof carefully to touch a green circle.</p><p class="double">Angel kicked the spinner again.</p><p class="double">“Ooh,” Discord said, squinting. “Feline.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis frowned, and her ears shifted to cat ears.</p><p class="double">Another kick. By now, Angel was reading a book.</p><p class="double">“Blue!”</p><p class="double">Twilight entered the forest clearing. “Hi, guys – okay, what the hay are you all doing?”</p><p class="double">Discord grinned, which was quite impressive, seeing as he currently had the head of a crocodile.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shrugged, awkwardly. “Discord calls it Shape-Twister. Says it&#039;s good practise.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, fair enough. How&#039;s that going, by the way?”</p><p class="double">“Ears and tail, mostly,” Chrysalis admitted. “Biology is hard. Discord finds it easy, though...”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s because I basically ignore it,” Discord stage-whispered, changing his crocodile head back to normal before putting his right arm on red.</p><p class="double">Just the arm. Not the rest of him.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that <i>has</i> to be cheating,” Chrysalis said, scowling. “I – whoa!”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced as pony, changeling and draconequus collapsed in a heap.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.7</p><p class="double">Dash looked over the paper. “Twilight... you sure about this?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Well, organizing things worked so well when I did it at the Winter Wrap-Up, and quite frankly the whole weather schedule seems <i>very</i> complicated – quite unnecessarily, really – so here&#039;s my plan, and I&#039;d like to give it a go.”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Dash looked at her friend askance. “If you say so, Twi. But this ain&#039;t gonna go well.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Dash!” Twilight grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What&#039;s up with the weather, ah ask you...” Applejack muttered to Twilight, as she dragged a cart to market. “Four months o&#039; constant sun! The apples ain&#039;t gonna take much more of this. Let me tell you, ah have half a mind to track down Dash and...”</p><p class="double">Twilight coughed.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, dry throat and all, too,” Applejack said sympathetically.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright, everypony,” Dash said, consulting her chart. “That&#039;s a hundred and twenty-eight days, on the dot, so that&#039;s it for the sunny period.”</p><p class="double">Several pegasi sighed with relief. Derpy had her hooves hooked into a small cloud, and was dangling upside down from it to stay in the shade.</p><p class="double">“What now?” Raindrops asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, according to this plan, we&#039;re past what&#039;s called Garam, and into what&#039;s called Khalif.”</p><p class="double">Silence greeted that announcement.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I dunno either. But it looks like tomorrow is going to be a storm.” Dash flipped onto the next page. “As is the day after. And... hold on a sec, guys.”</p><p class="double">Flip. Flip. Flipflipflipflipflipflipflip...</p><p class="double">“Huh.”</p><p class="double">Thunderlane crowded around to look at the weather plan. “...wait a sec. That&#039;s three and a half months away.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Dash confirmed, contemplating the work ahead. Then clapped her hooves. “Okay, looks like we get to just shove a storm cell on top of Ponyville and keep refilling it for... basically ages.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is not working,” Dash said to Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Yes, thank you, I had gathered that,” Twilight replied, keeping a shield spell over her book collection.</p><p class="double">They had to be shielded. After all, they were on the balcony in pouring rain – because Ponyville was flooding.</p><p class="double"><i>Note to self. Ponyville is not suited for a monsoon climate.</i></p><p class="double">Maybe, rather than just becoming an alicorn on occasion, it would make sense to reverse engineer Star Swirl&#039;s spell and learn how to <i>un</i>transform. If nothing else, she might be able to make it turn her into a pegasus, and clearly learning how the weather worked was going to take practical experience...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Chrysalis sat together in a bar, Chrysalis having a folder in front of her and downing another shot of whisky. Twilight patted her on the back while smiling, &quot;Don&#039;t worry. So, who&#039;s the next person on your list.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis pulled out a set of papers on her next attempt. The image of the pony caused Twilight&#039;s cheerful demeanour to disappear faster than Pinkie when she went to set up her &quot;Welcome to Equestria Party.&quot; Chrysalis opened her mouth to speak, but Twilight lifted the file up with her magic and caused it to burst into flames, &quot;Not him. It won&#039;t work out, I promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked in horror as the ashes fell, &quot;But...he&#039;s a prince like Shining! And also, the papers voted him the most eligible bachelor in Canterlot.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed at the comparison of Shining Armor and Blueblood. Where was looping Rarity when she needed her? She resolved to have the two meet the next time they were looping together.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;we&#039;re going about this wrong.&quot; A smaller, thinner folder floated out of her subspace pocket. &quot;It&#039;s time you move onto a different class of pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen opened the folder cautiously. &quot;...Loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s the one thing we haven&#039;t tried yet...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie blinked.</p><p class="double">She blinked again.</p><p class="double">She took a moment to compose herself. &quot;You... are asking me out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...we are both <i>mares.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis coughed. &quot;Well, technically, you&#039;re a mare and I... don&#039;t actually have ovaries, I just lay the eggs – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, you&#039;re right, stupid me. You&#039;re a shapeshifter! Not a problem.&quot; The unicorn giggled. &quot;Nope, not a problem, I just – why me?&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen bit her lip. &quot;Well... you&#039;re looping... and, you know my, ah, <i>issues</i> with Shining – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, no. No I don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis winced. &quot;...look, it&#039;s complicated, but I&#039;m trying to move on. And – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. I&#039;m a rebound?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No! Not like that – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I cannot believe – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It wasn&#039;t him! It was a not-awake version of him and – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot; – I thought you were actually into me or something – &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;GAAAH!&quot; A holey black hoof pressed against Trixie&#039;s muzzle. &quot;Look, I have issues, okay? And it&#039;s been suggested that I try to find another pony, and... I&#039;m doing this wrong. Hold on, let me start over.&quot;</p><p class="double">She took a breath.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Trixie Lulamoon, you have caught my attention, would you give me a chance to catch yours?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn stared at her.</p><p class="double">After a moment, she shook her head. &quot;You know for a species that literally feeds on love, you are terrible at this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My last stable romantic relationship was with an escaped slave of an enemy nation while we were both constantly hunted. I... it kind of just happened, situation... thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie shrugged. &quot;Okay... you know what, okay. Sure. Why not, let&#039;s see where this goes.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.9 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once again, Homura&#039;s eyes flew open. Once again, she rose into a sitting position and sighed. Once again, she had failed Madoka.</p><p class="double">Then she noticed that she was naked. And had hooves.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t scream or boggle at the sight. She&#039;d seen far stranger within witches&#039; barriers. Instead, instincts honed by an endlessly repeated month of struggle had her reaching for her Soul Gem.</p><p class="double">Which she dropped. Because she had hooves.</p><p class="double">Homura took a deep breath. She wasn&#039;t sure what was happening, or why. There was a very real possibility she had gone insane, or had become a witch herself, or both. Still, she could get through this. She had endured far, far worse than fleeting annoyance, and no doubt there was worse yet to come before she could finally rest.</p><p class="double">Still, it would&#039;ve been nice if she hadn&#039;t collapsed <i>immediately</i> after getting out of her hospital bed. Stupid horse legs. Stupid hooves.</p><p class="double">After a few mortifying minutes of learning how to work her new body, Homura realized something that she&#039;d missed while caught up between her usual post-reset depression and the whole horse thing: she didn&#039;t recognize her room. It was different. <i>She</i> was different. If ever there was a chance to save Madoka, this was it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nurse Tenderheart entered the room and beheld one of the chronic patients, a filly who had barely been able to move for years, jumping up and down in joy. The nurse smiled. Such were the miracles of modern medicine. &quot;Congratulations, Daybreak!&quot;</p><p class="double">The purplish-gray little unicorn seemed to halt in midair. Once she landed, she put on a terribly serious, composed expression that did nothing to hide her furious blush. Tenderheart kept a straight face thanks to years of paediatric experience. Checking the clipboard she had in her fetlock helped too. &quot;Now, everything seems to be order. Get your things together and we can get you released.&quot;</p><p class="double">The answer was as stiff as the filly herself. &quot;Y-yes. Thank you. I won&#039;t be long.&quot;</p><p class="double">It was a bit harder for Tenderheart to hold in her laughter this time. She tousled Daybreak&#039;s ebon mane. &quot;Come on, now. No need to embarrassed. This is a big day for you. It&#039;s only natural to get excited.&quot;</p><p class="double">Daybreak&#039;s lips slowly curved into a smile, as if she were afraid her happiness would be taken away the moment she tried to enjoy it. She blinked – were those tears? – and nodded. &quot;Okay.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tenderheart matched her smile for smile. &quot;Attagirl. Come down to the lobby whenever you&#039;re ready.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Homura moved quickly. She needed to. She couldn&#039;t take the chance that Kyuubey wasn&#039;t still plaguing the planet, which meant that she only had about a day to keep a cat from dying. Otherwise, as in that first go-around so long ago, Madoka would resurrect it with her contract wish.</p><p class="double">Luckily, it seemed some part of her remembered this new room as well as she did the usual one, the same part that had spoken English with a fluency she&#039;d only felt in the classroom after a few dozen loops. She knew where everything important was, and in some cases, <i>what</i> it was. The twin pouches were apparently saddlebags, and they were where she stuck the few personal possessions that had made the room more than a place to wait for either recovery or death.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t until she reached her glasses case that she realized that her vision was still blurred. Homura whipped out her Soul Gem with an impatient snort and once again willed her eyes to perfection.</p><p class="double">Once the world came back into focus, she blinked. What she saw didn&#039;t change. Her Soul Gem&#039;s light seemed to have escaped the little jewel and was now surrounding it, making it float in midair. Then she noticed a matching light above her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um…&quot; The Soul Gem drifted back into one of the saddlebags, as if responding to its owner&#039;s unspoken thoughts. The light faded.</p><p class="double">Homura decided to take a quick detour. Old and new memories agreed that the room would have an attached bathroom, which would have a mirror.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Homura moved down the hallway in a mild daze, trusting the strange intuition to guide her to the lobby. She wasn&#039;t sure how to feel about being a unicorn. Deep under the layers of emotional scar tissue, whatever was left of the awkward girl she&#039;d been thought she was absolutely adorable. Another part of her was wondering about the marks on her rump. The diamond she recognized from her fingernail and Soul Gem, and the twisted loop overlaying it seemed to be the symbol for infinity. Her new memories knew it was important, but couldn&#039;t say what it meant. A third was wondering how being a tiny horse would affect her magic. A fourth came back to whether Kyuubey was even here. Would there be any witches to fight? If not, how long could she last if she kept her magic use to a minimum? A fifth…</p><p class="double">Well, in any case, it was entirely understandable when she walked into an adult horse&#039;s legs.</p><p class="double">Homura stumbled back. &quot;Sorry! I wasn&#039;t—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s fine.&quot; The horse – <i>pony</i>, her new knowledge insisted – seemed to be female, given her voice. &quot;I&#039;ve certainly been lost in thought before.&quot; She was also a unicorn, Homura noted, her coat a more vivid shade of purple.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I see you two have met,&quot; said Nurse Tenderheart. &quot;Daybreak, this is Twilight Sparkle. She&#039;ll be looking after you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; A second later, Homura realized she was physically younger than normal. Too young, it seemed, for an apartment of her own. She may not even have the funds available to afford rent.</p><p class="double">The nurse seemed to be expecting her reaction. &quot;I know, Mister Cueball had already volunteered to take you in, but, well, he&#039;s coming in as you&#039;re coming out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s sick?&quot; Homura gave a silent cheer. Sure, the name could be a coincidence, but she was willing to bet all the money she might not actually have that Cueball had red eyes, a white coat, and an obsession with thermodynamics.</p><p class="double">&quot;Injured. Can&#039;t say why. Or won&#039;t.&quot; Tenderheart shook her head. &quot;Stallions. In any case, Miss Sparkle offered to take his place.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded with a grin. &quot;I think we&#039;re going to have a lot of fun, Daybreak.&quot; Her voice had the cheery condescension found in most people&#039;s &quot;talking to children&quot; voice.</p><p class="double">Daybreak Heart. That was her name. Or, at least, it was what everyone… everypony? Seriously? It was what every<i>pony</i> would be calling her. Homura gave a small smile of her own. &quot;I hope so.&quot; She was already devising a plan for getting out from under Twilight&#039;s hooves.</p><p class="double">As the two unicorns walked out of Ponyville General, Homura asked, &quot;How well do you know the ponies here, Miss Sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m no Pinkie Pie, but I&#039;m at least acquainted with quite a few Ponyvillians. Why do you ask?&quot;</p><p class="double">Well, it was worth a shot. Homura considered how Madoka might appear in this timeline. &quot;Would you happen to know a girl about my age? Pink coat, kind to a fault, wears ribbons in her hair?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight considered this for a few steps before shaking her head. &quot;Can&#039;t say I do, but Miss Cheerilee might. She&#039;s going to be your teacher. I can introduce you to her after you&#039;ve gotten settled in.&quot;</p><p class="double">Homura held back a groan. Of course it wouldn&#039;t be that easy. &quot;I see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she a friend?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An old one, but we&#039;ve lost touch.&quot; Homura drooped a bit. &quot;I don&#039;t even remember her name.&quot; Not whatever she was called as a pony, anyway. Strawberry Ribbons, maybe?</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find her soon,&quot; Twilight assured her.</p><p class="double">Homura simply grunted. Empty words were about the best she could expect from adults.</p><p class="double">There was a flash of light, and the filly came to halt, her head darting up. A translucent sphere had sprung up around her, leaving the outside world a bit dulled and blurred, like a light fog.</p><p class="double">&quot;Walk with me, Daybreak.&quot; Twilight&#039;s voice had steel in it now. </p><p class="double">Homura started walking. It seemed like a very bad idea to disobey that voice. She turned to Twilight, whose horn was faintly glowing. &quot;What&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The spell?&quot; Twilight gave a wave of her horn in no particular direction. &quot;It&#039;s a privacy field. Anypony who might be eavesdropping on us will only hear the sort of empty chatter I was subjecting you to until now. The situation? You tell me. About an hour ago, a transequine entity manifested in my house and told me that a temporal energy burst would erupt in the foals&#039; wing of the local hospital, and that I should be there to pick up a very confused filly before she hurt herself or others.&quot;</p><p class="double">At least the mare sounded like she was speaking to an equal now. Still, there was a problem. &quot;I don&#039;t understand,&quot; admitted Homura.</p><p class="double">&quot;Neither do I. I was hoping you could tell me who she might be. She identified herself as &#039;Eternal Hope.&#039; Does that help?&quot;</p><p class="double">Homura shook her head. &quot;Even if I knew her, it wouldn&#039;t be by that name. Do you know of humans?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. &quot;I see. I thought that might be the case. What&#039;s your actual name?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Akemi Homura.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.&quot; Twilight nodded, as though this told her everything she needed to know. &quot;I have a theory. Are you familiar with the term &#039;memory leak&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, if a computer program—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what computers are?&quot; Homura hadn&#039;t seen so much as a pixel since she&#039;d woken up. It was honestly a bit disconcerting.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know a lot of things.&quot; Twilight resumed the lecture. &quot;Anyway, if a computer program requests memory but doesn&#039;t release it, that memory can stay tied up. If the program runs over and over, it leaves more and more memory locked up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Over and over… &quot;Is that why I&#039;m a pony?&quot; Homura asked. &quot;Because I looped too many times?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;No, no. Imagine the leaking program is deleted, but the memory it allocated finds its way to another program that can use it, but has to change the file format… well, the analogy kind of breaks down at that point.&quot;</p><p class="double">Homura wasn&#039;t listening. Her attention had latched onto one word. &quot;Deleted?&quot; She lurched to a halt. &quot;What do you mean, &#039;deleted&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her mouth, but decided against whatever she was going to say before she could say it. &quot;Well, it&#039;s probably best you get the explanation from the best source. We&#039;re here.&quot; She dropped the privacy bubble and opened the library door.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Homura trudged through, too lost in thought to notice that she was walking into a living tree. Her gaze stayed on the floor before her until a pair of hooves came into view. She looked up, her eyes widened, and she dropped onto her haunches, mouth agape.</p><p class="double">Eternal Hope was a full-sized horse, pink as strawberry ice cream. Her mane and tail were cascading streams of energy, shading from magenta at the roots through purple, reaching royal blue by the tips. She had both horn and wings, and her cutie mark was a teardrop overlaid by a fat red X.</p><p class="double">Despite all this, Homura recognized her smile in an instant. &quot;Madoka?&quot;</p><p class="double">Madoka nodded. &quot;Hello again, Homura-chan.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I…&quot; Tears welled in Homura&#039;s eyes, and she wasn&#039;t sure why. &quot;I&#039;m so confused. Are you a magical girl? Are you safe? Is Walpurgis—&quot; She fell silent as wide, pink wings embraced her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shh.&quot; Madoka held her friend in her forelegs. &quot;It&#039;s okay now, Homura-chan. You don&#039;t have to worry about me anymore.&quot; With a chaste kiss to the forehead and a quick spell, she guided the unicorn to sleep.</p><p class="double">Once Homura was resting, Madoka looked up at her hostess and gave her a grateful nod. &quot;Thank you, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; Twilight said sincerely. &quot;Friendship problems are something of a speciality of mine, after all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So it seems.&quot; Madoka&#039;s ears flattened, her smile taking on a melancholy cast. &quot;It&#039;s a shame you won&#039;t remember this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head. &quot;What do you mean? I&#039;m the Anchor of this Loop.&quot; She began casting the first memory spell she could remember, already thinking of others besides.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t leave much of an impression on people. You&#039;ll see when I leave. Or, rather, you won&#039;t.&quot; With no further preamble, the alicorn transformed into pink energy and imploded, taking Homura with her.</p><p class="double">Twilight paused midway through casting Antimony&#039;s Anamnesis Assistant. &quot;Huh. What was I doing?&quot; She pondered for a moment. &quot;Casting a memory spell. And I&#039;ve forgotten what I want to remember. That&#039;s a bit too ironic to be coincidental.&quot; She scowled and extracted a file marked &quot;In Case Of Memory-Proof Entities&quot; from her subspace pocket. &quot;Darn it, and this seemed like it was going to be such a peaceful Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Madoka manifested outside of Yggdrasil in a similar surge of pink, this time in human form. Well, humanoid. To those in the know, the blue marks on her forehead and temples spoke of her divine nature. In her hands she held a brightly shining purple Soul Gem. Homura didn&#039;t need to see how the cosmic sausage was made.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it&#039;s you.&quot; One of the sausage makers happened to be nearby, scowling at the embodiment of hope from her seat in front of the supercomputer.</p><p class="double">Madoka gave a shallow but respectful bow. &quot;Hello, Skuld-senpai.&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld&#039;s scowl deepened. &quot;Don&#039;t &#039;senpai&#039; me, troublemaker. Your haywire ascension has been the biggest headache I&#039;ve had since we had to start the Loops.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;My universe ceasing to exist would cause a magical girl to despair,&quot; answered Madoka. There was a slight singsong aspect to her tone from sheer repetition.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nevertheless, I wasn&#039;t just permitted to preserve it, I had to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever you say, Little Miss Force-of-Nature.&quot; The raven-haired Norn called up a smaller window and cross-referenced the younger goddess&#039;s movements. &quot;So, what should I tell Sleipnir when he finds your fingerprints all over one of his worlds? You know, other than &#039;Here&#039;s my hammer. Go nuts.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I was just cleaning up after myself,&quot; Madoka said with a smile.</p><p class="double">Skuld snorted. &quot;That&#039;d be a first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Madoka shrugged and manifested her bow. The living device extended itself, runic interfaces blooming along its surface. She held the Soul Gem to one, which uploaded the jewel&#039;s data. Homura would be having some odd dreams for a while.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know,&quot; she mused, &quot;I&#039;m no expert, but it seems like you should&#039;ve backed up everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;On what, that twig of yours? You can&#039;t back up a supercomputer on a laptop, and it&#039;s not like we had a grove of server-grade world trees on standby in case of the unthinkable.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you may want to think about that in the future.&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld leapt out of her chair, hovering eye to eye with Madoka, debugging hammer in hand. &quot;<i>You</i> do not get to talk to <i>me</i> about the future!&quot;</p><p class="double">The other goddess didn&#039;t even blink. &quot;Hope is a wish for a better future. Aren&#039;t goddesses supposed to grant wishes?&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld sputtered for a bit, her grip on her hammer tightening to white-knuckle intensity. A dark, especially Norse corner of her mind noted that a good, old-fashioned blood eagle wouldn&#039;t kill a goddess. Not if done properly.</p><p class="double">Ultimately, she huffed a sigh and muttered, &quot;I don&#039;t have time for this.&quot; She returned to her chair and hunched over the console, typing furiously. &quot;<i>Some</i> of us are actually trying to <i>fix</i> this problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll get out of your hair, then.&quot; Once more, Madoka shifted into a plume of pink energy, entering her bow. The world sapling hovered for a moment before vanishing into itself, an ontological paradox only possible with the smaller models.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, Skuld continued to assault her keyboard, muttering divine profanities in commented-out Yggdrasil Command Speech. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">34.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a flash, Twilight appeared in the room. &quot;We have a – Oh! I&#039;m sorry, I just, I&#039;ll be going....&quot; She backed out sheepishly, averting her eyes.</p><p class="double">Spike and Rarity shared a look.</p><p class="double">Eventually, the dragon sighed and put down the spatula. &quot;She&#039;s not going to believe we were just making cookies, is she?&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;No, I don&#039;t think so.&quot; Rarity sighed, removing her apron. &quot;To be completely fair, we were licking the batter off each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You started it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, well. Maybe we should go see why she&#039;s here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose,&quot; Spike sighed, taking off his own apron. &quot;I just hope it&#039;s something important...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and that&#039;s it.&quot; Twilight finished awkwardly. &quot;So... um... yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike and Rarity stared at her, eyes wide.</p><p class="double">Eventually, the dragon coughed and took a breath. &quot;So. If I were to flat out say no...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Political explosions, possible war with the dragons and the griffons, a chance that Celestia could be deposed...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And if I say yes, I lose Rarity, marry some stranger, and go rule a nation of jerks.&quot; Spike dragged his hands down his face. &quot;Errrugh. What is with Celestia this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;I think she was banking on being able to shape the dragons into a more agreeable race before you hatched and matured. She&#039;s not awake, so... you know, she didn&#039;t know about...&quot; The unicorn gestured between the two of them.</p><p class="double">Rarity finally managed to gather herself. &quot;Well... you&#039;re a prince though! That&#039;s... okay, that&#039;s no justification whatsoever.&quot; She groaned. &quot;Who arranges marriages centuries ahead of time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And why did it take me centuries to hatch anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. &quot;Dragons this loop hatch when they hatch. You&#039;re an early bloomer.&quot; She levitated over the copy of the treaty. &quot;Anyway, when Celestia heard about you two, she sent me this. If we find a loophole, you guys get to stick together. We&#039;ve got three months. Go.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike cheered, slamming down a lawbook. &quot;Aha! If I choose to abdicate in favour of my cousin, the treaty with the griffons will technically be fulfilled!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Except your only cousin that still qualifies is still in an egg,&quot; Rarity pointed out, &quot;and part of the treaty stipulates renegotiating the trade agreement within a year of coronation.&quot; She sighed, looking up from the genealogies splayed in front of her. &quot;I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going to be able to find a peaceful solution to this, Spike. It&#039;s been two and a half months!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve still got half a month, and I am <i>not</i> going to give up on this. I won&#039;t abandon you even if I have to divorce my fiancée after the wedding.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awww... that&#039;s so sweet of you.&quot; The unicorn stood and stepped over to him, giving the dragon a fond nuzzle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t work,&quot; Twilight offered distractedly. &quot;Royal marriages require consummation, at least by these laws.&quot; She remained oblivious of the other two&#039;s glares as she sorted through another stack of books. &quot;Outdated. Doesn&#039;t apply. Doesn&#039;t apply. Outdated. Immoral. Revolutionary. Doesn&#039;t apply. Revolutionary. Doesn&#039;t apply...&quot;</p><p class="double">She stopped suddenly. The book glowing in her magical grip had stopped flipping.</p><p class="double">Spike put a claw on her shoulder. &quot;...Twilight? Did... did you–?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;it&#039;s risky,&quot; she managed. &quot;Dangerously so. Fatal for a normal pony, but...&quot; She let the book levitate over to Rarity. &quot;You might be able to pull it off.&quot;</p><p class="double">The ivory unicorn took the book, reading down the page. &quot;...rather uncouth, don&#039;t you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, well... it&#039;s the only viable option so far.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;I&#039;ll keep looking, but you should start training now.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Selindavri wrapped her tail around Spike&#039;s, draping a blue arm over his shoulders. &quot;Don&#039;t be so nervous, darling.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please... please don&#039;t call me darling.&quot;</p><p class="double">She patted his chest in understanding. &quot;Of course, of course. My big strong drake doesn&#039;t need such frilly nicknames, does he? Relax. In but a few minutes the ceremony will be over and we can move on to... important things.&quot; A gentle smile graced her snout. &quot;I know how hard this is for you, leaving the ponies, but it really is the right thing. And don&#039;t worry, you&#039;ll be able to see them fairly regularly... oh, and of course I will help you adjust to life in the conclave.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike rose an eyecrest, giving her a look. &quot;Really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s why I&#039;m here, da – ironpecs.&quot; Selindavri rapped a fist against him. &quot;Really, though, those <i>are</i> impressive. Ah, that&#039;s our cue.&quot; She patted his shoulder gently and began to walk across the volcanic ash, a serpentine silhouette against the red and gold glow of the lava flows. After steeling himself, Spike walked after her.</p><p class="double">Some accommodations had been made for Spike&#039;s friends of course. The dragons had arranged for an area filled with cooling charms and magical shields repelling the molten rock, where the ponies could watch the glorious wedding of the dragon prince. It was oddly quiet in that region, a contrast to the thrumming of the dragons surrounding the crater. Rainbow Dash and Applejack where fidgeting in their seats. Pinkie and Fluttershy couldn&#039;t help but click their hooves together as they watched.</p><p class="double">Twilight and Rarity seemed oddly calm.</p><p class="double">Finally, the couple stopped in front of a massive dragon, black as the sky with wings large enough to wrap over the entirety of Ponyville. He turned his red eyes on spike, and from him to Selindavri.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm. A match between the line of Horvem and the line of Krin. A portent of things to come, perhaps.&quot; He breathed in, not noticing the significant glance between two unicorns. &quot;Who here would dare object to this match?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was rustling among the watching dragons as Rarity stood. She walked out of the protective circle, horn gleaming as light wrapped tightly around her. Selindavri turned to look at her, surprised and annoyed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I, Rarity Belle, Child of the line of Platinum, claim this match unfit.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I expected opposition,&quot; the blue dragon said, &quot;but not from you.&quot;</p><p class="double">A black claw waved her to silence. &quot;She is within her right to object... should an elder not.&quot; The red eyes scanned the assembled dragons. &quot;Does anybody else challenge this match?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There needs be no other challenge. I invoke the right of claim.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a murmur from the dragons watching the scene. &quot;It&#039;s a trick!&quot; one cried. &quot;She&#039;s a disguised alicorn!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I assure you, my good sir, I do not have access to any such power. I am nothing but a tailor.&quot;</p><p class="double">Selindarvi sighed. &quot;You are a pony, miss Rarity. To fight me is to die, and I do not wish to sully my wedding with an international incident.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then you concede?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I would... refuse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity shook her head sadly. &quot;The line of Horvem has truly fallen to produce a dragon so... frail.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blue dragon narrowed her eyes. &quot;Careful, pony. I am being merciful, and I know how much your kind values that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. We do value mercy. That is why I am invoking Claim instead of Treachery.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mutterings of the dragons behind them ceased at once.</p><p class="double">&quot;An... interesting statement,&quot; rumbled the black behemoth. &quot;A threat, perhaps.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity said nothing.</p><p class="double">Selindavri flicked her tail. &quot;...clear the field. She will have her Claim.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Oh sweet Celestia I&#039;m fighting a dragon.</i></p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s face was the picture of calm as she stared across the lava pit, where Selindavri was meditating. She wasn&#039;t nearly as brutish as the dragon who would take up residence in the mountain every loop; in fact, had circumstances been different Rarity could easily see her as a potential friends. Coupled with her long claws and, to Rarity&#039;s trained eyes, well toned body, the unicorn could only come to one conclusion.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh sweet Celestia I&#039;m fighting a <b>smart</b> dragon.</i></p><p class="double">Then her mind threw up a fact she&#039;d stumbled across during her research.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh sweet Celestia I&#039;m fighting a smart dragon <b>with magic.</b></i></p><p class="double">The unicorn took a deep breath, thankful for the environmental filter spell she&#039;d cast, and let it out. She&#039;d fought smart dragons with magic before, on rare occasions. True, those were usually fused loops, and she was usually an alicorn for those fights, where here she had to avoid becoming an alicorn in order to keep her claim legitimate. Still, this wouldn&#039;t be as hard as it looked. Now if only she could convince the part of her that was a quivering ball of horse of that fact, and concentrate on strategies.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m going to die. I&#039;m going to be immolated. I&#039;m going to cease to be.</i></p><p class="double">Rarity told her instincts to shut the tartarus up, death was temporary and anyway she could easily avoid it.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m going to be torn to bits.</i></p><p class="double">She told them to shut up <i>please</i> she was trying to concentrate.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m going be gobbled up.</i></p><p class="double">With a sigh, she mentally grabbed her instincts by the ear and slapped them repeatedly. This, in retrospect, probably explained the headache.</p><p class="double">The black dragon took a breath. &quot;The time of preparation has ended.&quot;</p><p class="double">Selindavri snapped forward and slammed her magically glowing claws where Rarity had been half a second ago. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jump. Run. Dodge. Cast. Look. Roll. Spell.</p><p class="double">And then, suddenly, Selindavri backed away, tilting her head. &quot;No... you are the smart one, aren&#039;t you? You&#039;re playing to your strengths.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Very well then.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity had less then a second to react before the fire hit her. The blue dragon let out a sigh. &quot;Tactics are important, but power is too.&quot;</p><p class="double">The fire suddenly <i>rippled</i> unnaturally, tightening and compressing until it wrapped around the unicorn in a fanciful, glowing dress. &quot;While I agree, I do think theatrics play a part as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....hmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two women circled cautiously around, now truly assessing each other. Occasionally, Selindavri&#039;s tail would flick a boulder at Rarity; she&#039;d destroy it, naturally, but always did so in a different way. Her return volleys were similarly countered, once by claw, once by wing, once by magic... and then again by claw, but not the same manner as before. The battle had become a series of small, tense tests as the two attempted to get a feel for each other.</p><p class="double">Selindavri suddenly feinted with a claw, so obviously that Rarity was already dodging her snapping jaws – itself another feint as the massive tail wrapped round and flung her into the air.</p><p class="double">With a glow of her horn, gravity was negated. She smiled, lounging in the sky as her flaming dress whipped in the upcurrents of the crater. &quot;I must say, the view is striking from up here! Very powerful. I can see why dragons chose this as a meeting place.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was something of an inspiration to me, actually.&quot; Selindavri nodded back, a small smile on her own face as her wings snapped out. &quot;I&#039;m glad I got to share it with you.&quot; A single flap propelled her toward the hovering pony.</p><p class="double">Of course she wasn&#039;t expecting Rarity to suddenly fall straight at her weighing as much as Cerberus himself.</p><p class="double">When they hit the ground, the unicorn rolled off, glancing at the dragon behind her. Still breathing... and much more surprisingly, attempting to get up. &quot;Are you alright, dear? I don&#039;t actually want to injure you permanently, just convince you to concede.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You... are quite good.&quot; Selindavri shook her head as she stood.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...but not good enough.&quot; The dragon&#039;s neck whipped about, circling them both with fire as she raised her claws and slammed down. Rarity couldn&#039;t help but let out a pained cry when she felt the magic around her being torn away as easily as a sheet of paper. Even with her own admittedly vast stores of power, it would be incredibly difficult to weave a spell without a field of magic around her. Then Selindavri swung a claw at her–</p><p class="double">Technically, her horn was glowing. Technically, she did forge the shield that protected her. Granted, she&#039;d forged it a while ago, in a loop where Mithril could be mail ordered – at a high cost – and she&#039;d just pulled it out of her subspace pocket... but if Selindavri drew the conclusion that she&#039;d just spawned it out of mid air, which judging from her expression she did, then Rarity wasn&#039;t going to correct her.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Why do you want him?&quot; the dragon finally asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I love him,&quot; the unicorn replied simply.</p><p class="double">There was a moment of quiet.</p><p class="double">Then Selindavri shook her head and, with a flap of her wings, put out the ring of fire. &quot;I concede.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity blinked, putting down her shield as her ears perked forward. She&#039;d... honestly expected that to be a lot more difficult.</p><p class="double">The massive black dragon tilted his head, confused as well. &quot;This is an unexpected outcome. Explain.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pride.&quot; Selindavri looked at the ones watching her. &quot;It is not power that drives a dragon. At our core, we are proud creatures. The purest of us, the ones remembered in fame and myth, are the avatars of honor, dignity, and confidence. And ponies, for all their differences, have among them pure hearts as well, but there core lies not in pride, but in love. I would never oppose a dragon whose pride was pure; I would be a fool to not extend that right to any pure heart, even if their purity is one I can never hope to have. And it is clear that in this matter, at the least, Rarity Belle of the line of Platinum has a pure heart.&quot;</p><p class="double">She smiled crookedly. &quot;Aside from which... I will still be an advisor to Spike, no matter the outcome. That is enough for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm.&quot; The elder drake pondered the words. &quot;Very well. Claim has been made, Claim has been taken. If another wishes to make Claim...&quot; His eyes peered at the watching dragons. &quot;Speak.&quot;</p><p class="double">None dared make a sound.</p><p class="double">&quot;....then we will reconvene in a fortnight for a proper union.&quot; And with that, the black drake shut his eyes and let his head rest on the ground, a clear dismissal. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well.&quot; Spike sipped his drink for a moment. &quot;That&#039;s that then.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, it was quite something, wasn&#039;t it?&quot; Rarity shook her head, relaxing on the couch. &quot;This whole fiasco has tired me out, darling, I just hope the rest of this loop&#039;s politics aren&#039;t as crazy as the Platinum Crown loop...&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon raised an eyebrow. &quot;The....?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Before your time. I was doing research on Blueblood for that loop and it turned out his actions were based off a childhood belief that since Celestia was, well, Celestia, he was essentially worthless.&quot; She waved a hoof. &quot;I helped him out, we fell in love, noble families tried to sabotage our relationship to get their hooves on ancient spells... There was the whole thing with Chrysalis, too, I&#039;m still not sure exactly how involved she was.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You fell in love with <i>Blueblood?</i>&quot; Spike sputtered incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Like I said, it was before you started looping. I was incredibly young back then... I thought I&#039;d changed him permanently. I didn&#039;t realize he&#039;d reboot.&quot; The unicorn sighed as her face flushed. &quot;I spent half the next loop a complete wreck. I...&quot; Rarity looked up at Spike, smiling gently. &quot;I&#039;m glad I learned that lesson before you started looping, darling. Don&#039;t hold on to that which is fleeting, but cling to that which truly matters.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike blinked. Then, slowly, he chuckled and shook his head. &quot;Well... thank you. Really, though, Blueblood? I can <i>not</i> figure how that one happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Looking back on it, I think it was just a strange loop. You have no idea how long Twilight teased me about it.&quot; With a dramatic swoon the unicorn fell back into her couch. &quot;And now you know my darkest secret! O please my dear sir, do not think of me less for it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For shame, Lady Belle! For shame!&quot; The dragon waggled a claw. &quot;Naughty, naughty!&quot;</p><p class="double">It only took three seconds for the both of them to collapse in helpless giggles, Rarity moving to make room for Spike to sit down. They leaned into each other, laughing for a good long while. Eventually they managed to collect themselves, looking at each other and sharing a smile.</p><p class="double">Then Spike took a breath. &quot;You know, we&#039;re lucky Cadance is awake this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Rarity tilted her head. &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because she would kill us both if I did what I&#039;m about to do while she wasn&#039;t.&quot; He stood up, wringing his hands.</p><p class="double">The unicorn&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;Spike... are you–?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When I saw you out there,&quot; the dragon began, &quot;I... I saw how you were beautiful even then. Even taking on a full grown dragon, one of the most dangerous and... and let&#039;s face it, dirty things anybody could do, you were absolutely radiant. And it wasn&#039;t just how you looked. It was how you moved... how you acted. You were... amazing. And... I thought about how were all the time, and how much you have given of yourself... Rarity, you&#039;re a wonderful pony. An incredible pony. And seeing you out there... I realized I didn&#039;t want to lose you, even as temporarily as one loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">He reached into his subspace pocket. &quot;Honestly, I&#039;ve been waiting for a loop where we&#039;re <i>all</i> awake. The girls, the princesses, Shining Armor, the Crusaders and their friends, Trixie, Gilda, Chrysalis...&quot; He scoffed a bit. &quot;I doubt Berry would be there even if that would have been nice. But... after this, after coming so close to having to give up the pony I love.... it&#039;s not something I can do.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike knelt down, taking the object in his hand and opening it. &quot;Rarity... will you please do me the honour of letting me claim you forever? Will you please give me the joy of... of becoming my... my wife?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><i>And lo, on that day did appear a smile so radiant that it came not solely from the heart, but from every fibre of the lady&#039;s being. Tears so tightly filled with joy that a single one could hath drowned Chrysalis herself ran freely down her face, a face blushing not from embarrassment but from the overwhelming emotion coursing through her. Her laughter was loud and graceful, dancing through the room in a glorious ballroom waltz which she could not join, for already she had leapt upon her partner and cried a single, pure confirmation. The knight, overwhelmed by his own emotions, could barely slide the ring he had forged and perfected o&#039;r lifetimes onto her waiting hoof before joining in her laughing tears. And they grew close, sharing a single deep kiss that spoke of the most complete union of souls any mortal could hope for.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....mmmmmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight walked into the room with a sheaf of papers. &quot;So, I think I&#039;m done with – Oh! I&#039;m sorry, I just, I&#039;ll be going....&quot; She backed out sheepishly, averting her eyes, but a smile danced upon her face. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='35'></a><h3>Halloween Special part 1</h3>
<p>With her usual dexterity, Pinkie Pie opened up her oven and pulled out her latest piping hot creation with her oven-proof hoof mitts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, how does this go?&quot; the pink-coated baking pony though to herself, &quot;There was something about chaos and degenerate suns...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, I&#039;ll just make my own thingy up!&quot; she happily decided, &quot;Oh great bust of Discord, which I have baked out of meringue. Hi! It&#039;s me, Pinkie Pie! Um, please make every pony turn into their costumes for this Nightmare Night, oh and also make sure no pony gets really hurt as a result, because I just want this to be a really fun surprise. If you do this, I will make you a tasty cake and other treats when you get freed from your stone prison-y thing. So I speak-eth, so mote it be. Heh, mote. That&#039;s a funny word. Moat. Moooote. Oh yeah!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie reared up and slammed her front hooves on the table to each side of the meringue statue, channelling as much earth pony magic into the ritual as she could. The sugary bust of Discord started to glow.</p><p class="double">Then she suddenly realized something. &quot;Oh no! My costume! There&#039;s no time to put on the one I wanted, and I don&#039;t have any good ones in my pinkie-storage-space at the moment. I don&#039;t want to take my ascendant form because Twilight could probably figure out what was going on. Oh yeah! I do have costumes hidden all over for just this kind of emergency.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie rushed over to her nearest stash, and then stopped. There were two costumes that she really, really wanted to wear. She whipped her head between them before deciding.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, there were two Pinkie Pies. One started struggling to get into the strange crab-like costume while the other one grabbed the various supplies and accessories and ran into the next room.</p><p class="double">A liberal, if messy application of temporary coat and mane dye, a fake cutie mark sticker, a bit of magic and willpower to straighten her mane and tail, some cardboard and felt wings, and the last bit... Then there was a brief pulse of magic as the tasty statue activated, and it wasn&#039;t Pinkie Pie standing there anymore.</p><p class="double">She looked around in confusion, tried to take a step and stumbled. After regaining her balance, she looked at her hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. I have hooves now? I&#039;m a... horse?&quot; The pony looked around at herself. Cream colored coat, although with a few faint pink splotches.</p><p class="double">She walked up to a nearby mirror and stopped. She had a straight brown mane and tail, but her gaze continued over to her flared wings and horn and, yep, there was a mark on either side of her.</p><p class="double">As she stared at small inkwell and quill, Lauren exclaimed, &quot;I have a cutie mark. I&#039;m a &#039;my little pony&#039;. Why am I not freaking out.. oh wait, there it goes.&quot;</p><p class="double">The new alicorn twitched a few times and collapsed into a shivering ball.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled to herself as she slipped the crablike claws over her front hooves, glancing at her barrel to reassure herself that, yes, the false pair of legs there still clung to her form. It had taken a bit of trickery to figure out how to pull that off; eventually she resorted to a tad of chaos magic in order to keep them from just dangling, which really was rather appropriate. The large pair of thestral wings slumping over her shoulder were counterbalanced by the thick foam tail she&#039;d slipped over her own poofy mange. Of course she had to spraypaint herself and her costume with a special adhesive, before rolling around in coloured powder that was a slightly darker shade of pink then her coat; the end result, though, looked satisfactorily fungal, and she was after all a fun gal to be around.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now for the final addition.&quot; The party pony reached up to her mane, shaking it forward and all about unto her entire face was obscured in a globe of twisted curls. &quot;Ha! Nightmare Night, here I c--&quot;</p><p class="double">Error.</p><p class="double">Shift.</p><p class="double">Chrksxcin twirled its antennae in confusion. This was not the Graceful Realm. If anything, it looked to be a home of a flincher, though the spectrum coming from the objects were varied. How had this individual come here? A stretch of its antennae confirmed that no other Mi-go were in the area... or at least none scenting.</p><p class="double">Something was... disturbing. The idea of something being utterly wrong, of course, was laughable; no Mi-go would ever submit to the idea that something shouldn&#039;t exist, because by existing it obviously should. But disturbing was a reasonable translation to the concept now fluttering through Chrksxcin&#039;s mind. Being alone, save for flinchers... it could possibly handle a small group, but the surroundings indicated a large number, and the lower vibrations did nothing to reassure it.</p><p class="double">With a flick of its wings, Chrksxcin glided to the top of the room, skittering out a convenient window and peering. A mirrorrock was above, although going by the plantlife obviously this world has a flaresphere as well. What confused the Mi-go even more, though, were the flinchers wandering below; more like flincher livestock in form, though obviously as intelligent as the flinchers and with more than a little aetheric manipulation. At the very least they were not looking for it.</p><p class="double">Not enough information. Chrksxcin decided to remain unseen for now, listening and watching.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight awoke the day before Nightmare Night. &quot;Well, this is different. Feels like a standard Loop, but why start this late?&quot;</p><p class="double">She checked her Loop memories more carefully and, finding nothing amiss, she began replanning her costume. As much as she loved her Starswirl costume, it was time for something more fun... especially if she could pass off an ascension as temporary spell work.</p><p class="double">Hopefully, if she was lucky, Rarity was awake and she would be able to get some help with a temporary coat, mane and tail dye. Her own spellwork tended to last longer than she really wanted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia shook her head in confusion. She recognized the Everfree Forest, but she didn&#039;t remember any towns this well-established so near her and ... Luna&#039;s ... castle. Additionally, from the pumpkins scattered around, it was harvest time. She frowned as she recognized the silhouettes of Nightmare Moon pinned in the windows.</p><p class="double">&quot;We thought We&#039;d told Our little ponies not to slander Luna like that...&quot; She paused as she passed a mirror. What had happened to her mane? It was still its normal, desperately soft pink, but why was it cut so strangely? She looked like a librarian, though it did look pretty good with the stripes her mane was beginning to develop as she overworked her magic, raising both her own sun and Luna&#039;s moon...</p><p class="double">Wait. Her connection with the Moon was gone. She glanced up at the rising orb and felt a pang of worry. &quot;Lulu&#039;s back? I&#039;ve got to find her before....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sister?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia spun around, and her heart caught in her throat. Luna was back, and so much taller than... wait, Luna had a full-blown aura in her mane? What?</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s gaze showed her own confusion. &quot;Twilight Sparkle? Your Nightmare Night costume is most splendid, but I would have thought you&#039;d have sent us a letter if you&#039;d ascended.&quot; She chuckled fondly, much as Celestia herself had when one of her little ponies had done something both amusing and amazing. &quot;Come, now, I&#039;m sure Tia will be flattered when we show her. And so proud that you did it without help!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna? What&#039;s going on? Who&#039;s Twilight Sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s good cheer evaporated into concern. &quot;Something is amiss....&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia quailed at the changes all around her. All of their little ponies were deeply bowing to her and her sister and the tall form approaching.</p><p class="double">&quot;M-mother?&quot; Her heart thrilled, and then stilled as the motherly alicorn approached and she saw her own Cutie Mark.</p><p class="double">She began panicking and adjusted the Element of magic on her brow. &quot;I&#039;ve been thrust into the future? I mean, obviously, I get back where I belong, or there wouldn&#039;t be a future to come to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, my faithful student! What a flattering Nightmare Night cost... are those wings real?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, who&#039;s this Twilight everypony keeps saying I am... my daughter? I mean how, if future-me is that tall... how&#039;d I find both the time and the stallion to have a foal?&quot; She couldn&#039;t help noticing the meaningful glance future-Celestia shared with future-Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your Highnesses!&quot; A guard strode in, bearing a filly alicorn on his back. &quot;Something is turning ponies into their Nightmare Night costumes!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia and her older self both turned and sent their magic to examine the filly. Their golden auras commingled, startling her elder self. &quot;Whatever has affected this filly seems to have applied a thaumic cascade resonance via similarity to the paper cone she&#039;d originally had for her costume. More disturbing to me is the fact I can tell her regalia was originally yellow painted cardboard, but it&#039;s now orichalcum. The Thaumic energy costs must be immense just for one shoe alone!&quot;</p><p class="double">Elder Celestia regained her composure, as Luna was keeping the transformed filly entertained. &quot;Alfalfa monster, Luna, really?&quot; She shook her head regally. &quot;I&#039;m frankly more worried about <i>you</i> though. My initial scan tells me that a similar effect is on you, but only to the degree of coat and mane dye being made real.&quot;</p><p class="double">Younger Celestia grimaced. &quot;My plan to get away from the nobles would have worked if they hadn&#039;t knocked my hat off. Nopony would seriously believe a princess would be <i>that</i> pink!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance strode in, looking every inch an Empress. &quot;Have I arrived at a bad time?&quot;</p><p class="double">Younger Celestia boggled. &quot;Oh come on! I can&#039;t believe what made me look ridiculous looks <i>great</i> on her! Who is she anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna looked between the two alicorns of the day, one true and the other ensorcelled. &quot;Tia...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Lulu?&quot; They both replied.</p><p class="double">Luna grit her teeth and attempted the calming exercise her &#039;niece&#039; Cadance had shown her. She raised her hoof to her peytral and took in a deep breath before exhaling and pushing her annoyance away. She then pointed at her actual sister. &quot;For convenience&#039;s sake, I think that I&#039;ll call <i>you</i> Tia...&quot; She turned her hoof to the younger &#039;Celestia.&#039; &quot;... and I&#039;ll call you &#039;Celly.&#039; Do not look at me like that, at least I&#039;m not calling you Sunbutt.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, this will be so much fun.” Letting out a barely audible squeal, Fluttershy finished putting on her wig.</p><p class="double">The rabbit beside her made some snuffling noises.</p><p class="double">“Oh, don’t be such a spoil-sport, Mister Angel Bunny.” Barely containing her elation – which, in combination with the timid pegasus, meant she smiled openly – Fluttershy pulled a druid’s charm out of her sub-space pocket and affixed it inside a midnight-blue-painted cone. “And with this, I can even make my ‘horn’ seem to glow when I am using a spell.”</p><p class="double">Angel gave her a sidelong stare and stamped a foot.</p><p class="double">“No, I promise. Only a few half-stares and some fog or creeping vines.” Lifting her mane out of her face with one wing, she fastened the fake horn to her forehead with the other. “It’s not like I-”</p><p class="double">For a moment, everything seemed to stop, as if the universe itself was taking a deep breath.</p><p class="double">“What is this madness!? Why are we not where we sensed our sister!?” Nightmare Moon whipped her head around to get her bearings. “You there! Tell us where this here place is! NOW!!”</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny looked into his friend’s eyes. <i>Never</i> having seen her frenzied like this, he did the only thing he remembered how to do. He ran.</p><p class="double">“Humph.” Turning around to the mirror in front of her, Nightmare Moon looked herself over. “It seems not only our magical powers have been diminished by a thousand years of banishment.” And in truth, her midnight blue coat seemed dull, the coloration off, like it was mixed with a bit of yellow, and her mane had lost much of its sparkle. “Well, it is of no consequence. Once we find our ‘dear sister’, we shall be the unchallenged ruler of Equestria. AhahahHAHAHAHAA!!” What animals there had been left in Fluttershy’s cabin made a break for it.</p><p class="double">The Mare of the Moon turned up her nose. “Ungrateful boors. Now, where would our sister hide?” Concentrating, she could feel the magic running through her... and then wink out. “What in Tartarus!?” Trying to turn into mist, she charged up, her horn glowing brightly... and then sputtering out. “WE DEMAND THAT THOU WORKEST!!” But again, all that happened was that her horn briefly glowed, after which nothing happened.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon’s left eye twitched. Then she got a hold of herself and a confident smirk spread across her face. “Impressive, dear Tia, we shall give thee that at least.” Turning to the door of the house she seemed to be in, the Mare of Darkness started cantering forward. “But this shall not save thee!” With a sinister laugh, she left the cabin and started moving toward the illuminated town in the distance.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Honestly, Dash, I don&#039;t see why you&#039;re complaining.&quot; Rarity swished her cape to the side as she sidestepped a young foal. &quot;You&#039;re fashionable <i>and</i> terrifying!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus grumbled, her bandaged wings fluttering slightly as she checked the exotic chestplate she wore. &quot;It&#039;s just a little bit confining. I thought I&#039;d get looser wrap.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya do pull off th&#039; Cleopatra look pretty well, though.&quot; Applejack smirked, her teeth unnaturally sharp. &quot;Ya sure ya didn&#039;t have ancestors in the Sphinx Empire or nothing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, it&#039;s been a couple of loops since I checked my family tree.&quot; Rainbow Dash shrugged. &quot;Maybe I do, maybe I don&#039;t. I&#039;ll do some research... later... ish.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m sure my dear Spiky-wikey would be happy to help with that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike smiled, nuzzling Rarity affectionately. &quot;Whatever you say, Mistress...&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn blushed. &quot;Spike! We&#039;re in public!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, just getting into character.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack gave a saucy whistle, which set Rainbow off giggling. Rarity shot them an annoyed look before turning back to the dragon. &quot;In that case, I might just have to suck your blood, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a smile out of Spike. &quot;Your wish is my command, Mistress.&quot; He managed to keep a straight face as Rarity turned red... before suddenly cracking up. &quot;Alright, alright. I&#039;ll lay off. Besides, I promised Twilight I&#039;d see who she dressed up as. I&#039;ll catch up with you gals later!&quot; With a wave of his shackled claws, the dragon walked away.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still, hahaha, can&#039;t believe you got him to dress up like that,&quot; Rainbow gasped, panting for breath. &quot;I don&#039;t, hahahah, don&#039;t know what you were thinking...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Ah&#039;m pretty dang sure she was thinking bout how sexy he&#039;d look as a genie,&quot; Applejack commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pfffhahahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity rolled her eyes, although her face was flushing uncontrollably. &quot;Honestly, Applejack, just because you decided to relive the pet loop doesn&#039;t mean you need to be so feral.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmpony waved a false paw. &quot;Yer right. Ah shouldn&#039;t leap on them sort of comments just cause Ah&#039;m a wild animal.&quot; Her smile widened. &quot;But yer just giving me so much opportunity--&quot;</p><p class="double">And then the world shifted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lady Belle would have recoiled if she&#039;d been a lesser being. As it was, her muzzle merely crinkled in disgust at the foul creature in front of her. &quot;What are you doing in my presence?&quot;</p><p class="double">The feral creature growled and raised its hackles, clearly disliking her as much as she disliked it.</p><p class="double">Then a third presence made itself known. &quot;يا شباب؟ ما أنت -؟ على عقد، ما هيك أنا أقول؟&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hey, guys? What are you--? Hold on, what the heck am I saying?</span></p><p class="double">Both of them turned to a rotted, decrepit creature covered in bandages and golden armor. Lady Belle raised an eyebrow. &quot;And what manner of being are you? Dressed as death, yet I feel great power...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;يا هيا الندرة، كما تعلمون لي! قمت بها هذا الزي! على محمل الجد، ما هيك أنا أقول؟&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Oh come on Rarity, you know me! You made this costume! Seriously, what the heck am I saying?</span></p><p class="double">The strange creature winced as the wolf pony snarled at her. Lady Belle shook her head at the foreign babble. &quot;So long as you do not interfere with me or mine, I have no quarrel with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her eyes narrowed as she turned to the orange beast. &quot;This one, however, is a plague on the night. If it does not submit, I will be forced to teach it... respect.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Derpy donned her costume, all five bags of it. It was, in her opinion, devastatingly clever. By using common household items as garments, she refuted the bourgeoisie preconceptions of what garments could be, forcing ponies to take a hard, unflinching look at the role clothing played in a society of habitual nudists. It transcended the base fright of ghouls and goblins, instead presenting the viewer with a deeper, more existential terror, the kind that only the satirist could inflict.</p><p class="double">Dinky was going as a firepony. She&#039;d certainly gotten enough experience when her mom got too high-concept in the kitchen for her own good.</p><p class="double">Derpy waved as Dinky joined her friends.&quot;Have fun, Muffin! Don&#039;t talk to strangers! Momento mori!&quot; A bit grim, perhaps, but nothing kept a filly from Crusader-level foolishness like reminding her of her morality.</p><p class="double">As the herd of sugar-seeking foals galloped off, the world <i>twisted</i> for a moment.</p><p class="double">After a moment of ontological confusion, Derpy found herself holding the bag she&#039;d perched atop her mane... except she&#039;d never written anything on it. The paper was supposed to be a blank canvas on which onlookers could project their insecurities. Instead, scribbled in what looked like correction fluid and smelled like marzipan, were the words &quot;I don&#039;t get it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fillystine.&quot; Derpy threw the bag to the ground in disgust. Or tried to. It was a paper bag.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, ma&#039;am.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot; Derpy looked up from her discarded headgear only to stop halfway. A tiny firepony stood before her. Not a filly in a cheap costume, but one outfitted in half-scale replicas of rescue worker gear, complete with smudges of soot and the smell of smoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Could you tell me where I am?&quot; asked the pint-sized impossibility. &quot;Last I remember, I was getting back to the station, and now everything&#039;s huge.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy fainted. She would later argue it was the only rational course of action.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Cutie-mark Crusaders were making their own arrangements for Nightmare Night. They had gathered in the Treehouse and were getting into their costumes.</p><p class="double">“I wish we could have done the three pony leaders, not the advisors...” Sweetie Belle said, adjusting her cloak. “Rarity could have helped me make an awesome Princess Platinum costume.”</p><p class="double">“Uh huh, no way I was doing Chancellor Puddinghead,” Apple Bloom shot back, adjusting her hat. “Besides, Diamond Tiara did Princess Platinum last year. And Clover the Clever is pretty cool.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn across from her wrinkled her muzzle at the reminder of why she hadn&#039;t gone princess.</p><p class="double">“Hmph!” Scootaloo looked out from under her crested helmet. “It&#039;s okay for you two, Clover the Clever and Smart Cookie are both great characters. I&#039;m stuck being Private Pansy.”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. “You do know that Fluttershy was playing her a lot more timidly than most versions? She was Commander Hurricane&#039;s bat-pony, and effectively his aide.”</p><p class="double">“Mmmm.” Scootaloo&#039;s eyes grew distant, re-imagining Private Pansy with a black cloak and cowl, silhouetted against a skyline. “I wonder if it&#039;s too late to put together a thestral costume... Wait, Commander Hurricane was a guy?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s what I heard.” Apple Bloom replied. “Twilight was talking with Miss Cheerilee about doing our own Hearth&#039;s Warming Eve pageant as a school play and I overheard. Seems doing the play at Canterlot last year got her interested in the story...”</p><p class="double">“Well we&#039;ve got Nightmare Night to get through first!” Sweetie Belle exclaimed. “The fire of friendship may live in our hearts, but I&#039;m more interested in lots of candy living in my stomach!”</p><p class="double">There was a ripple of discontinuity, which none of the trio noticed.</p><p class="double">“Pansy, Cookie? What just happened?” Clover the Clever shook her head to clear it. “For that matter, how did we get here, wherever here is!”</p><p class="double">“Well &#039;here&#039; looks to be some sort of wood cabin, up in a tree unless I miss my guess. Well used too. I&#039;d have said earth-pony, excepting the fine paper some-pony used for that scrawled map on the wall. And whatever happened turned us into fillies and messed with our memories!</p><p class="double">“I remember... stuff, the Fumblewinter, the Exodus, fighting the Windigoes, our meetings to hammer out the Alliance, trying to organise things and get the new towns like Mane Hat and that mining camp in the Canter Lots mountains set up. But when I try to remember how we got here, I draw a blank.”</p><p class="double">Lieutenant Pansy was already checking the windows and door, cautiously, as was her nature. She hadn&#039;t said anything, just went to work making sure no-pony was eavesdropping. Having completed the circuit, she came over to the other two. “I believe the area is secure, from eavesdroppers at least.”</p><p class="double">Clover&#039;s horn sparked and spluttered, than glowed feebly. “Argh! Whatever they did affected my magic. It&#039;s barely active – whatever effect de-aged us, it altered our abilities to match our new ages. But there aren&#039;t any scrying spells in the immediate area, that much I can tell.”</p><p class="double">“You thinking what I&#039;m thinking, Pansy?” Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">Compared to Commander Hurricane, or as the trio liked to call him in private &#039;the Great Bag of Wind&#039;, Pansy might seem diffident. But that retiring nature concealed a first class brain, skilled in tactics and strategy. Hence the name Pensee, which meant &#039;thought&#039; in an old dialect. “It&#039;s safe to assume that whoever, or whatever did this did not have our best interests at heart.”</p><p class="double">“Then we&#039;re all in agreement.” Clover nodded. “The &#039;how&#039; would require a group of unicorns working in concert to cast such a powerful spell. It&#039;s possible earth-pony magic could affect our growth, but our memories? Only unicorn magic could do that.”</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie gave a deep sigh and started pacing, as she often did when talking through a problem. “Chancellor Puddinghead anticipated some sort of reaction from some of the old guard unicorn nobles when the Council of Tribes put forward the newest proposals, but not this. If only forging the Fire of Friendship had burned away the old enmities along with the Windigoes.</p><p class="double">“But it isn&#039;t that easy. The great mass of all three tribes look to us as their saviors, and the ones who keep the Windigoes at bay. They are willing to follow our lead and let the Fire of Friendship into their hearts, or at least lay the kindling. But in too many hearts there is only the empty hearth of despair, or a hearth choked with the bitter ashes of hatred, or the bright flames of greed and envy, leaving no fuel for friendship to ignite...”</p><p class="double">“Smarty, you&#039;re preaching to the choir...” Clover interjected, to stop her friend&#039;s familiar rant. Smart Cookie was the politician of the trio, but that sometimes lead to speech-making even when with her friends.</p><p class="double">“Take us out of the political equation, and the old power blocks would have a chance to restore their power. Too many of the older, more powerful unicorns and pegasi find the new &#039;uppity&#039; earth ponies sit ill with them, as well as cordially hating each other. Even some earth ponies would be happy to see us gone, as they don&#039;t want equality, they want their own shot at being top of the pile, at vengeance for the generations of serfdom to the other races.</p><p class="double">“So even though you say it was unicorns that did the deed, the masterminds behind it could be from any or all of the three races. They might hate each other, but they might be willing to ally to stop us, figuring to diddle the other two later.”</p><p class="double">“I know Commander Hurricane isn&#039;t happy about the alliance, but I&#039;ve managed to keep him sweet so far by telling him how his decisive leadership makes him admired by the troops.” Pansy got a thoughtful look. “But if they wanted to remove us, why not just kill us? Why simply de-age us, but leave us with our memories?”</p><p class="double">“Maybe they made a mistake.” Clover said excitedly. “Think about it. Even if they wiped our memories back to our filly days, the bond of our friendship would still be there. Starswirl is certain that bonds can exist between ponies, even if the memories that created them are absent. So they could have us hidden away somewhere, brought up as friends from foal-hood, and all the while our friendship would provide the power to keep the Windigoes away. They&#039;d have the advantages of the Fire of Friendship without our inconvenient presence in the political arena.</p><p class="double">“However, the friendship bond between us may have shielded our long term memories, the memories of us becoming friends, and everything connected to it. The spell probably suppressed them and wiped out our short term memory, but our true selves came bubbling back up after a time. This is probably some way-point on the way to wherever we were being sent. That&#039;s probably why there&#039;s no guard. Three amnesiac foals aren&#039;t likely to go anywhere.”</p><p class="double">“So, escape, intelligence gathering, and then we hunt down whoever did this!” Pansy said, looking uncharacteristically fierce.</p><p class="double">“We can count on Chancellor Puddinghead for aid.” Smart Cookie stated. “If we can get to him without tipping our hoof.”</p><p class="double">“It sounds like a plan to me.” Clover said in agreement. “If we can get a message to my mentor, I&#039;m sure he can help us reverse the ageing spell. I know for certain that he wouldn&#039;t be a party to this scheme.”</p><p class="double">They headed out of the tree-house and Pansy tried to fly down, only to find that her wings didn&#039;t work properly. The best she could managed was a steep glide. She grimaced as she landed heavily, and called up to the other two. “Clever. They didn&#039;t want me flying to get help if my filly self panicked.”</p><p class="double">Clover joined her on the ground. “I saw a town from the balcony. There seemed to be a lot of lights for this late in the evening, coloured ones too. I suggest we go there first, we can get lost in the mass of ponies – especially if, as I suspect, there&#039;s some sort of festival going on.”</p><p class="double">“Well, we won&#039;t get any older standing here...” Smart Cookie said, then face-hooved. “You know what I mean!”</p><p class="double">The mistake was probably deliberate, but it still made her companions smile, which was almost certainly the idea. She wasn&#039;t called Smart Cookie for nothing. With their spirits lifted, the three trooped down into Ponyville.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The cream coloured alicorn extended herself out of the fetal ball position and ambled over to the nearest couch.</p><p class="double">&quot;Get a hold of yourself, Lauren. I&#039;m sure being a naked pony is some sort of strange dream or vision quest I&#039;m having due to the days of brainstorming to find a way to reboot that old cartoon without turning ponies into superheros,&quot; the mare glanced out of the window only to see an odd pony agilely hopping along the rooftops. It was dressed in a costume that could only be described as a fusion between batman&#039;s and darkwing duck&#039;s.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not helping!&quot; she shouted ineffectually at what could only be her subconscious delusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;So even if this is just some crazy dream, it does feel very real. Oh wait,&quot; the alicorn looked around frantically before spotting a discarded newspaper. She rushed over, picked it up, and stared at the articles.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! I can&#039;t read any of this. You&#039;re not supposed to be able to read in your dream, right? Or was that just a plot of a movie I saw? The point is that I&#039;m not crazy!&quot; Lauren smiled.</p><p class="double">Then the smile faded with a realization, &quot;Okay, I&#039;m going to take a mulligan on the whole talking to myself thing that I&#039;ve been doing, but I&#039;m still not crazy. Right?&quot; she asked a small alligator that had crawled up onto a couch cushion. Said alligator just blinked asymmetrically and slowly opened up his mouth, which was lacking any teeth whatsoever.</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you know? You&#039;re probably just a symbol of.. of my unfounded fears or something like that. Well I&#039;ll show you, you toothless fear-gator. I&#039;ll head right on outside and into this dreamworld.&quot; The alicorn swiftly trotted over to the door and opened it up on... complete pandemonium. A group of ponies were battling a mummy pony, a vampire pony, and a werewolf pony. None of them sparkled. Up on a nearby rooftop, a strange but somehow very familiar winged fungal crab creature scuttled across and out of sight.</p><p class="double">The front door slammed shut.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, I can do this. If I can handle screaming Powerpuff Girl fans at a convention, I can do this.&quot; Once again the door opened, but this time the alicorn pony stepped out into the chaos.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, you can do anything you want in a dream. That means...&quot; Lauren grinned as she flew upwards, her wings flapping instinctively, &quot;I take it all back. Flying is awesome! This is the best dream... well, the second best naked dream ever!&quot;</p><p class="double">Higher she flew. There were enough pegasi and other flying creatures in the air, that she wasn&#039;t noticed or stared at all that much. The alicorn set down in a peaceful corner of an orchard, near a child&#039;s tree house. That peace was interrupted when three fillies emerged slowly from the surounding trees and approached her.</p><p class="double">&quot;We mean you no harm. Who are you and what manner of pony has wings and a horn?&quot; said the small wingless, hornless pony cautiously. Whatever reactions the three fillies were expecting out of the strange winged unicorn, a girlish squeal wasn&#039;t one of them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the three got closer, Smart Cookie looked down at her clothes and up at the other two and rubber her chin with a hoof. “Huh, I’m wondering if we shouldn’t disguise ourselves. Change our clothes about and our manes. A pegasus filly wearing armour is definitely going to attract attention at least.”</p><p class="double">“A lot of the younger ponies are going around without anything at all, now that we no longer have to protect ourselves from the cold of Fumblewinter. I’ve done it a time or two myself.” Clover mused. “It felt… odd the first time, but it’s quite liberating once you’ve gotten used to it.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm… our emblems are not well known, but if there’s someone from the conspiracy in town, they may recognise them. Do you have enough magic in that horn to disguise them?”</p><p class="double">“That much I can do. I only have the power for cantrips, but I know quite a few that could be useful, including a cosmetic spell to change fur colour. It won’t hide them for long, but it’ll do the job.”</p><p class="double">Pansy was already removing her kirtle, but stopped and said in a strained voice, “I don’t think that will be necessary.”</p><p class="double">She showed her bare flank. The other two immediately checked their own hindquarters to the same result. Smart Cookie gave a strangled gasp, while Clover looked dumbstruck, and stuttered, “But that’s… impossible! Even if we were de-aged, we still have our memories, our knowledge. An emblem is connected to the pony’s spirit, not their body! I helped Starswirl do the research. This must be a side effect of the memory spell, but it would have to be very powerful to affect our souls as well as our memories.”</p><p class="double">“Another thing to fix, but at least it solves our immediate problem,” Pansy finally managed. “But I think we should wait until we can see the local ponies directly before we get changed. Speaking of which, this orchard seems awfully large.”</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie nodded, focussing on that to overcome the shock. “True, I don’t remember any this large or well developed in our latest survey, and look at the spacing of the trees, they were planted, not a natural orchard some-pony found.”</p><p class="double">They reached the edge of the orchard, and looked out over the town. There were yells and screams, and the impression of a lot of running about. “Maybe we won’t need to change clothing, it sounds like a wild party down there.”</p><p class="double">“More like a riot…” Pansy pointed at the sky. Look at all the pegasi in the sky, but why aren’t they in armour?”</p><p class="double">“And what is that!” Smart Cookie’s eyes widened as something approached, flying down towards the orchard, a pegasus as big as any they’d ever seen and oddly proportioned. “Take cover!”</p><p class="double">They did so and observed it as it landed, which only increased their confusion. It had an impressive horn, and an ink bottle and quill as an emblem.</p><p class="double">“A winged unicorn?” Clover said quietly, looking incredulous.</p><p class="double">Pansy smirked and whispered. “Or a Pegasus with a horn.”</p><p class="double">“Or a… okay, I’ve got nothing!” Smart Cookie quipped, but keeping her voice as low as the other two. “At least she doesn’t look hostile. And I can’t imagine any scenario where something like that would be allied with a conspiracy to keep the tribes separate. We need information, and she may be able to provide it.”</p><p class="double">They emerged from their hiding place and approached slowly, Smart Cookie in the lead. “We mean you no harm. Who are you and what manner of pony has wings and a horn?”</p><p class="double">Whatever reactions the three fillies were expecting out of the strange winged unicorn, a girlish squeal wasn&#039;t one of them.</p><p class="double">&quot;You three are adorable! You must be the dream representations of Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup.&quot;</p><p class="double">The fillies looked at each other in confusion. The earth pony spoke up again, &quot;We do not know any pony with those names.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren thought for a moment and asked, &quot;Do you know any ponies named Firefly, Posey, Sparkler, Surprise, Twilight, or Applejack?&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies shook their heads, up until the name &#039;Applejack&#039; came up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, we know of an Applejack. She&#039;s an earth pony who runs the &#039;Falling Apple&#039; tavern and inn. Makes great homemade liquor. But the rest of the names you mentioned are not familiar. And as I said, we have never seen a pony like yourself. &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The night shall rule forever!&quot; said a dark pony with a dark flowing mane, wings, and a horn as she flew by. Unlike Lauren&#039;s horn, this pony&#039;s horn was sputtering ineffectually, &quot;Why won&#039;t thy work right? What insidious curse did my own sister do to my magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No matter, I shall triumph despite this handicap!&quot; the dark pony said triumphantly right before she flew into a tree, &quot;Ow! I had believed that I was more able at flying than this. Truly, this is a fell curse Celestia has afflicted upon me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rubbing her forehead, the dark pony slowly flew away. Lauren pointed at the direction the other alicorn was heading.</p><p class="double">The three fillies looked at each other before Smart Cookie answered, &quot;We have never seen that pony before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t care about that,&quot; Lauren said, &quot;Is she trademarked? I think I just found the first season villain for my new show.&quot;</p><p class="double">“You are a writer, a playwright?” Clover asked, “I thought you might be from your emblem. But I do not think that pony was marked for a trade… A crescent moon emblem often implies some-pony skilled in magic, but she had the look of a pegasus warrior, and we heard her curse her lack of magical power. What’s more it sounds like she was using that modern slang that young ponies are affecting, badly. Even I know it should be ‘thou’, not ‘thy’.”</p><p class="double">Pansy snorted. “Any warrior that clumsy wouldn’t last a week. But we should be talking to the horned pegasus who didn’t fly off… stratus! We need a better name for ponies like her since they seem to be popping up all over the place.”</p><p class="double">“Alicorn?” Clover suggested. “She has traits of ‘all’ of us, after all.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe she has a name for her race as well as herself.” Smart Cookie suggested. “Maybe we should introduce ourselves first. I am Smart Cookie, advisor to Chancellor Puddinghead, leader of the earth ponies.”</p><p class="double">The other two agreed. “Clover the Clever, apprentice to Starswirl the Bearded and, a tutor and advisor to Princess Platinum of the unicorns.”</p><p class="double">“Lieutenant Pansy, aide-de-camp to Commander Hurricane of the pegasi. And I’m usually taller than this.”</p><p class="double">“We all are,” Smart Cookie added. “We were full grown mares, but some fearful curse has reduced us to filly-hood.”</p><p class="double">She examined the alicorn’s face for signs of recognition or understanding, and saw none. “We recently forged an alliance between our three races but there are members of all three who fear change and the loss of their existing power, and would return our peoples to three mutually suspicious, feuding tribes. They would consider you an abomination. So we may have common cause. May we know your name?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;May we know your name?” said the precocious little earth filly, Smart Cookie. The inner girl within Lauren almost squealed at the cuteness exuded by the three little ponies in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure. My name is Lauren Faust. It&#039;s great to meet you three. This is turning out to be the best dream I&#039;ve had in a long time. Although when I&#039;m not dreaming, I don&#039;t look like this.&quot; she gestured to her new body, &quot;I&#039;m human.&quot;</p><p class="double">Private Pansy and Smart Cookie looked confused, but Clever Clover spoke up. &quot;A Human? Strange hairless minotaur-apes from another dimension? Those are a myth.&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony and pegasus looked at their friend. &quot;You&#039;re an absolute mine of of useless information, aren&#039;t you Clover?&quot; Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I enjoy the reading of fanciful tales and mythical beasts in my spare time,&quot; Clever Clover defended herself, then grinned. &quot;Besides, it&#039;s not always useless, case in point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One for her side,&quot; Pansy quipped, and Smart Cookie shrugged, rolling her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;It doesn&#039;t mean I seriously think they exist though,&quot; Clover added.</p><p class="double">Lauren snorted in amusement. &quot;The magical unicorn doesn&#039;t believe in humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh you should read some of the stories written about them,&quot; Clover said. &quot;Ponies have claimed to have dreams, visions of other worlds, other times where these humans exist. Others believe that there are places in the world where the local magical field is so strong, it creates a weak point between different dimensions – pools, fracture planes of crystal, surfaces that reflect the light of other worlds. However, no-pony has ever shown them to exist, though admittedly such things would be unstable.</p><p class="double">&quot;That doesn&#039;t stop the stories though. Humans rarely seem to have magic, but they use tools even more than earth ponies. Wooden ships that sail through the roughest seas, armies in pegasus-like armour fighting ones in skins, or humans that wear unicorn-like plate, and ride horses who don&#039;t seem to object to the practice. Villages of mud brick or cities of stone. I&#039;ve even seen the writings of this one mad stallion who claimed there was a world where every pony had a human counterpart.&quot;</p><p class="double">She shook her head. &quot;I studied the stories when I got a scholarship to the Academy, before Starswirl took me as his apprentice...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can see where this is going,&quot; the alicorn said, &quot;but I can&#039;t write another high school drama, even one about a magic school. It&#039;s cliché, and after battling the kind of horrors they did in generation one, trying to master gym class seems like a vast demotion. Oh, you wouldn&#039;t know any horrible monstrosities for ponies to fight? Good villains make for good stories.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So you are a playwright,&quot; Smart Cookie said. &quot;If you are in need of monstrous villains, I can tell you about the windigos. The evil spirits of cold and hatred that brought about Fumblewinter. Only by standing united, did the three pony tribes manage to drive them off.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren thought for a moment. &quot;So, unkillable spirits of cold that could only be driven away? Nah, that&#039;s definitely too much like the dementors from Harry Potter. I guess I&#039;ll stick with using that silly bad dream pony.&quot; </p><p class="double">Smart Cookie looked ready to explode, but Pansy put a hoof on her shoulder, forestalling a tirade. &quot;Calm yourself. You heard her, she thinks this whole world is a dream she&#039;s having, she doesn&#039;t understand what we went through, you more than many.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie growled. &quot;Having the monsters that caused all that suffering , who almost killed us, dismissed so lightly...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;C&#039;mon, we have a mission to accomplish. She&#039;s clearly not interested in aiding us, and probably has no useful intelligence on the situation down there, so we had best leave her to her day dreams, and get on with finding some actual help.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover the Clever had put a hoof of her own on Smart Cookie&#039;s shoulder, but had turned back to the alicorn with a thoughtful expression on her face. &quot;Before we go, could I do a magical scan of you? It is just that I have never seen a pony like yourself, with both wings and a horn. I assure you, it is harmless.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Magical scan?&quot; That piqued Lauren&#039;s interest, &quot;Sure, go ahead!&quot;</p><p class="double">A faint glow formed around Lauren, causing her to twitch. &quot;Hey, that tickles!&quot;</p><p class="double">The faint glow swiftly cut off.</p><p class="double">&quot;I do apologize, ma&#039;am. It seems I was less than careful with my tests as I could not believe the result of the first one.&quot; Clover said in her most respectful tone of voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she a threat?&quot; the pegasus spoke for the first time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pansy, this alicorn; Lauren Faust, is several orders of magnitude more powerful than my mentor, Starswirl. If she wanted to, she could rotate the planet just by herself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie spoke up, astounded, &quot;But that takes hundreds of unicorns working together.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. And actually if what my scans tell me is correct; she has unicorn, pegasus, and earth pony magic all in harmonious resonance. If she so desired, I think she could rearrange the solar system.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies slowly looked over at the smiling, happy alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, this world is my dream. It makes sense that I could control the sun and the moon and the planets.&quot; Lauren swished her tail around in a complex circular pattern, and then stared at it, &quot;Oh my gosh! Did you know my tail is fully prehensile. Check this out!&quot;</p><p class="double">The smiling alicorn bent over to her side and promptly stuck the end of her straight brownish tail right into her left ear.</p><p class="double">Private Pansy gave a sigh, &quot;And to top it off, it appears that she is completely insane.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s why we can&#039;t leave her behind. You heard her, we&#039;re a dream, a fantasy, with no consequences for whatever she does. She could pull the moon out of the sky, or fling the sun away beyond recovery playing with her powers, or just by accident. She has has to come with us, so I can teach her at least the basics of controlling her power,&quot; Cover said quietly to the other two.</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie gritted her teeth, then schooled her expression into pleasantness.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ma&#039;am, or do you prefer to be called Lauren? Clover has offered to show you how to use that horn on your noggin. She&#039;s an amazing mage. and a capable teacher. All we ask is that you come with us, let me and Lieutenant Pansy deal with anything threatening, and not use your magic unless Clover approves it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can do magic?&quot; Lauren grinned. &quot;This keeps getting better and better!&quot;</p><p class="double">The group started down into town, with Clover going through a very brief explanation of how to focus energy in a horn, and shape it</p><p class="double">&quot;Every unicorn can do telekinesis, it&#039;s practically instinctive, and light spells are almost as simple. For more complex normally use spells, a matrix or pattern that embodies the most efficient way to shape the magical energies. However, if you have enough power, you can brute-force it just by willing the effect to happen. Though don&#039;t you try it yet, with your power you could hurt some-pony by accident. Now, watch me.&quot;</p><p class="double">She slowly built up energy in her short horn, and lifted a pebble from the side of the track, carrying it with her. &quot;You see what I did? Now you try it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren remembered the tingling sensation, and tried to build it up in her horn, as instructed. She picked out a pebble and willed it to rise. There was a whip crack and a vertical shooting star as the pebble shot up; a sheath of superheated plasma forming around it and reached escape velocity within a few hundred feet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops!&quot; Lauren blushed.</p><p class="double">Clover face-hooved. &quot;We&#039;ve gotta long way to go...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Curse our sister for robbing us of our magic!&quot; Fighting her sputtering magic, and still nursing a terrible headache, Nightmare Moon reached the town – well, more like a hamlet – and after checking her bearings, made her way toward the town centre. &quot;Oh well, we are sure it will suffice for these peasants.&quot;</p><p class="double">Just as she was going to approach for landing, her eyes fell upon her sister. &quot;’Tis thou!&quot; she cried. &quot;Tia, thou shalt PAY FOR THIS!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon swooped down from the sky like a bird of prey. Celestia’s ears drooped and her expression turned to horror. &quot;L-lulu!?&quot; Backing away, she was transfixed by the dark alicorn before her. &quot;B-bu-but I banished you away!&quot;</p><p class="double">The elder Celestia – as well as Luna, who had been talking to the Sun Princess’ smaller version when the alicorn of the night arrived – looked on, utterly perplexed by the scene unfolding before them. Because, however you looked at it, this impromptu piece was truly strange.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah!&quot; The Mare of the Moon stamped her hoof. &quot;Didst thou think it could hold us forever!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna leaned over to her sister and whispered: &quot;Did we- I! Did <i>I</i> really sound like this?&quot;</p><p class="double">‘Tia’ - the elder Celestia - nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;NO!!&quot; The smaller Celestia burst out, then caught herself. &quot;No! I was <i>hoping</i> for you to return some day, but...&quot; She trailed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;But what, <i>dearest</i> sister?&quot; Nightmare scoffed. &quot;Thou didst even lock away our magical abilities! We demand that thou dost return them!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Abilities?&quot; The other mare’s ears pricked up. &quot;I did not do a thing to them!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lie not, foul trickster!&quot; The midnight blue alicorn reared up on her hind legs and stomped back onto the ground. Then she lit her horn, which flickered briefly and then sputtered out. &quot;Does our magic look functional to thee!?&quot;</p><p class="double">‘Tia’ stepped in. &quot;Now, girls. Wh--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Interrupt not, fo-!&quot; Nightmare Moon’s pupils became as small as pinpricks. &quot;Tia!!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh dear.&quot; Luna face-hooved.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&#039;Celly&#039; tensed, and frowned at what her senses were telling her. Nightmare Moon was a pegasus, despite having a horn. The overlay spell that &#039;Tia&#039; had shown her – rather, reminded her of – showed an aetheric echo of a pegasus with some sort of odd charm under a false horn.</p><p class="double">It was a little fascinating how the charm interacted with pegasus magic to produce – she shook her head. Things were far too confusing to let herself go off on a tangent like that. She grit her teeth. &quot;Sister, please, more has gone wrong than you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;SILENCE!&quot; Nightmare Moon bellowed in the Royal Canterlot Voice, and Celly felt herself beginning to shrink under the intensity of her fallen sister&#039;s gaze.</p><p class="double">And that was when, deep down in the unconscious reaches of her being, she realized who her opponent was! Steeling herself, the diarch of the sun took a deep, calming breath... and stared right back. Her gaze was enough to force an entire griffon army into submission – yet it simply washed over Nightmare Moon as if it was nothing.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s quite enough, Nimmy,&quot; Luna said, and suddenly a wing came down over the Mare of Darkness.</p><p class="double">The false Nightmare Moon stiffened under the embrace. &quot;Nimmy?!&quot; she spluttered. Half-turning around, she glared at her alter ego. &quot;How darest thou call us pet names?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Simple.&quot; Giving a smirk, Luna pulled her closer and waved a hoof at her sister. &quot;While Tia and I have our suspicions, we&#039;re not quite sure who you are underneath this spell, but I am at least extending you the same courtesy we are extending to Twilight Sparkle while she thinks she is Celestia. Now, please, calm yourself and look around. What do you see?&quot;</p><p class="double">Calmly, Luna pointed out the decorations and that Nightmare Night was as much a celebration of the night as it was of fear.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon felt unsure. &quot;I just wanted them to love me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna gave a motherly smile as she said: &quot;They do, and I am pretty sure that they love who you are underneath as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Mare of the Moon blinked...</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess Celestia?&quot; Fluttershy turned her head. &quot;Princess Luna?&quot; She then examined her costume. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">‘Celly’ gawped. Then she started to smile. &quot;Huh. So there is a way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes hardened. &quot;<i>We</i> happened. And we do not intend to leave, yet!&quot;</p><p class="double">The smaller sun goddess&#039;s ears drooped. &quot;Or not.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cadance set back on her haunches in shock. She&#039;d been intending to visit Ponyville on Nightmare Night anyway this loop, just to see what it was like, but Twilight thinking she <i>was</i> Aunt Celestia was a bit much. As she numbly watched the attempted battle between &#039;Celly&#039; and &#039;Nimmy,&#039; she was interrupted by a gentle nudge at her fetlocks.</p><p class="double">She turned her head and found herself looking into a filly alicorn&#039;s bright eyes. &quot;Your Imperial Highness? Would you care for some tea?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance smiled. The Best Babysitter Ever™ was on the case.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrksxcin glided through the darkness, its wings humming quietly with aetheric energy as it observed the world below. There was a surprisingly large number of other flying creatures, but so far it had avoided being seen. Or the other flyers didn&#039;t care. Either way was acceptable--</p><p class="double">Suddenly its antennae burned, and it landed on a roof near a massive tree. With a quiet chitter, Chrksxcin peered over the edge of the roof.</p><p class="double">A collection of the odd flinchers were standing and conversing. Each one had a pair of wings and a stiff extension extending from the middle of their scanprods. More importantly, though, the sheer amount of aetheric power flowing through their bodies – except, oddly, the black one – was enough to level a planet. Had Chriksxcin had a concept of actual fear, it would have been utterly terrified. As it was, it was merely... cautious. Clearly one of them had to be responsible for transferring the Mi-Go to this world... or perhaps it was that <i>other</i> major aetheric power source Chrksxcin could feel coming up behind it.</p><p class="double">The fungus turned, observing the massive, manacled monster rising on a column of pure aether. That. That it did not wish to anger.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where is my Mistress?&quot; the creature thundered. &quot;Where is Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">Realizing that a confrontation between two massive sources of power was not something it wanted to get involved in, Chrksxcin scuttled to the other edge of the roof and glided away.</p><p class="double">[<hr>]</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, I was expecting a song cue back there...&quot; Lauren said, disappointed, as she held a boulder twice her size, and a ball of water from a convenient well in the air to either side of her. After several smaller rocks had achieved orbit, Clover had finally gotten her to tone her telekinesis down, by giving her something heavy so she needed less fine control.</p><p class="double">All three ponies looked at her oddly, but Clover was the one who asked, &quot;A song... queue? Only a few unicorns have the ability to focus their magic through music. It&#039;s a rare and powerful gift, and your emblem would surely show an affinity for it if you could.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren looked puzzled, &quot;Okay, what&#039;s an Emblem? I heard you talking about it earlier... oh, you mean my cutie-mark?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what some of the younger ponies are calling it nowadays.&quot; Smart Cookie said, &quot;Spear Shaker and his crowd, the same bunch that are coming up with that slang that idiot from earlier was spouting.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now that&#039;s a fun idea, Shakespeare as a teenage rebel...&quot; Lauren mused.</p><p class="double">&quot;How do you know of Emblems if you don&#039;t know of this world?&quot; Pansy asked, slightly suspicious.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve got stories about something similar at home. Cutie-marks show a pony&#039;s special talent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Partly right. Emb... cutie-marks show how a pony has decided to express their special talent. For example, my talent is learning and studying magic, and my cutie-mark is a four leafed clover with a book resting on it. Clovers, especially the four leafed kind, are magically powerful reagents and can enhance pretty much any spell or potion. I received it when I became Starswirl&#039;s apprentice. It represents how I can help enhance magic through study and research. If I&#039;d taken the instructor position at the Academy, as I loved teaching almost as much, my mark might have been different.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Can I see it?&quot; Lauren exclaimed.</p><p class="double">Clover sagged slightly. &quot;Unfortunately, these de-aged bodies have no cutie-marks. I still don&#039;t understand it, our memories and experiences are intact, so that decision, that expression of our souls should be too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Ware ahead!&quot; Pansy pointed up ahead where they could see a scene of chaos across the bridge that lead into the town square. Several ponies in outlandish clothing were running around, both adults and foals, and there was a lot of yelling and screaming.</p><p class="double">&quot;The hay!&quot; Smart Cookie frowned. &quot;What are those things!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Things out of old mare&#039;s tales!&quot; Clover replied analytically. &quot;A vampony, a wolf lycanthrope, and... I&#039;m not even sure what that thing in bandages is, but it looks like some old legend of undead creatures... and other ponies all mixed in! There&#039;s too much happening!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy was taking a more tactical approach. &quot;From the way they&#039;re placed, I think the vampony and the werewolf were fighting each other and the other undead is trying to keep them apart. I think the other ponies are just underhoof, too scared to get out of the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well some-pony&#039;s got to stop them before any-pony gets hurt!&quot; Smart Cookie exclaimed, and started forward.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait!&quot; Pansy&#039;s voice had a snap of command, and Smart Cookie froze. &quot;None of us are at our normal strength.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Pansy, we can&#039;t just do nothing!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus shook her head. &quot;No, but we need a plan. Clover, strengths and weaknesses?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If the old legends... vampony, can&#039;t cross running water, shies from magical light, killed by sunlight, staking or beheading. Lycanthropes, regenerate from anything except wolfsbane or silver, but there&#039;s a pony trapped inside, not in control of their actions, unlike the other two it&#039;s a living creature, could be knocked out. The other undead, magical light again. All three are tougher and faster than any regular pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm... Clover, you stay back, support us with cantrips to keep the other two from attacking us while we pony-pile them one at a time. Smarty, I need you to hit them low, buck things at them, while I drop in from above. Lauren, stay back here with Clover, your magic is too unreliable for a fight. If only we had some of those things you said...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Normally I could summon them without too much trouble,&quot; apologised Clover, &quot;or transmute your horse-shoes to silver temporarily.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you can&#039;t,&quot; Lauren stated as she gently set down her boulder. However, her massive orb of water was still in the air, &quot;You may have been mighty warriors in the past, but right now you are just three little fillies. That means you are not going out there to fight monsters that were made to scare adults. Besides, it seems to be a stalemate from what I can see. The mummy pony is keeping the vampir.. er.. vampony and werewolf pony from attacking each other. It&#039;s like better version of that Twilight series. It would have been at least kind of entertaining if Bella was secretly a mummy...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That what do you suggest for our course of action, Ma&#039;am?&quot; Clover asked, having gotten somewhat used to the alicorn&#039;s unidentifiable references.</p><p class="double">&quot;We wait. We watch. If anything tries to attack us, I&#039;ll gently throw my water ball at them. How&#039;s that for running water, hah!&quot; Lauren said to the three little de-aged ponies, before sitting down on the grass, &quot;Look, I just wanted to say I&#039;m sorry. Even if this is my dream, I should have been a bit more respectful of you three. I used to play with my little pony dolls as a child; I&#039;d stage elaborate adventures, and now I&#039;m in one. Who&#039;s to say that dream worlds are any less real than the one we live in. It could be just like in the Sandman books. In any case, I apologize.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clever Clover, Smart Cookie, and Private Pansy looked at each other. Cookie still seemed angry at her tribe&#039;s near extinction being dismissed so casually. Pansy was never a pony of many words, and that trait didn&#039;t seem to changing soon. Clover spoke up, &quot;I accept your apology, Ma&#039;am. Just do try to be more careful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll try, but it&#039;s not that easy.&quot; Lauren sighed. &quot;It&#039;s like someone telling you to take the smallest step you can, but when you try it&#039;s never small enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">No one really had anything to say to that. Instead, the three fillies crouched down next to the alicorn while watching all angles for possible attack. It was quiet for several minutes before Lauren spoke up quietly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m glad you girls don&#039;t look like my old dolls, though. Instead of being all chubby looking with long muzzles, you&#039;re more like sleek pony-cat hybrids.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... thank you?&quot; Clever Clover replied, &quot;There is actually a great deal of research and controversy on how we evolved traits more in common with predatory animals like forward facing eyes and...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not the time for this,&quot; Pansy interrupted.</p><p class="double">There was silence as the four ponies watched the stalemate. The mummy pony was still keeping the other two from fighting while constantly chattering in her strange language, but was getting more exasperated. Other ponies, dressed up in various outfits, gave them a wide berth as they ran around in the pandemonium.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still think this is my dream,&quot; Lauren pointed with her hoof to a pony dressed as a dentist who was threatening any other pony she saw with a giant levitating toothbrush. Also, her mane was made of toothpaste. &quot;How else can you explain that other than my subconscious telling me I should brush more often.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is an exceptionally odd sight,&quot; Smart Cookie admitted, &quot;as is that.&quot; She pointed to where two viking pegasus ponies were trading sword strokes with several pirate ponies who were led by a small colt.</p><p class="double">&quot;No band of undisciplined viking raiders can match up to the dread pirate Pipsqueak and his crew!&quot; cried out the high pitched voice of the pirate captain.</p><p class="double">The lead viking mare spoke up, &quot;But what if the viking raiders hired a ninja mercenary?&quot;</p><p class="double">And out of nowhere, a ninja stallion entered the fray.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot; Lauren stared at this. &quot;I got nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">That was when every pony&#039;s attention was drawn to an immense dragon-genie which rose up out of the centre of town with a mighty roar.</p><p class="double">The three fillies turned towards the alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t use that,&quot; Lauren said calmly as she stared ahead, &quot;Dragonball did it first.&quot;</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>Clever Clover just gave a long sigh. “You do realise we have no idea what you&#039;re talking about?”</p><p class="double">“I just wish I could power a translation spell. I want to know what that... mummy, you called it... is saying. For that matter, the town itself doesn&#039;t make sense!”</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie nodded. “I noticed that too, it looks like an earth-pony settlement, but fancied up by unicorns! All the windows are glazed rather than shuttered, the houses have multiple stories and they even have fountains! It looks long established, but... nothing in Equestria is yet. We&#039;ve been here less than a dozen years, but the roads here are all paved, the bridge is well crafted stone and there are all kinds of fancy decoration, even without those things for whatever festival they were having.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m more interested in the ponies,” Pansy said.</p><p class="double">“The fact that even I don&#039;t know what half of the costumes are supposed to be, or the fact that there&#039;s unicorns, earth ponies and pegasi all mixed in?” Clover asked.</p><p class="double">“Both, Pansy replied.</p><p class="double">“Arrgh! I hate just sitting here and not being able to find out what&#039;s going on!” Clover fumed. “If only I had more power... Wait!”</p><p class="double">She turned back to Lauren, a dawning realisation in her eyes. “If we could find a safe way to regulate the power flow, you could lend us some of your power. You have the powers of all three races in you, and in such quantity that you could empower us and never miss the difference.”</p><p class="double">She started pacing again. “The problem is your control. It&#039;s getting better, but it wouldn&#039;t take much excess to burn us out. Of course, you&#039;d have to agree in the first place. Let me see... applying Gutterhoof&#039;s fourth nume the parametric phase variance would modulate the power flow in phase... we&#039;d need some yellow chalk... reversing the polarity of the thaumic flow... would that make it a Singlestone trapdoor function? T equals H F squared where H is the harmonic factor and friendship... Adjusting for the incident light level... we could omit the dribbly candles.”</p><p class="double">“What on earth is she going about?” Lauren asked.</p><p class="double">Pansy shook her head. “She gets like this when she&#039;s doing her magic stuff. Just let her be, she&#039;ll come up for air soon enough. But if you really can lend us your power, please do so! I don&#039;t know how much you&#039;ve used those wings, but if you have, you must know what it&#039;s like for a pegasus to be grounded! I feel so... limited, unable to protect my friends!”</p><p class="double">“Likewise!” Smart Cookie added. “That giant creature seems to be coming closer, and it doesn&#039;t look friendly.”</p><p class="double">“... and a three eights Gripley!” Clover finished. “I&#039;ve got it! We use a triune ritual diagram, but we reverse it! We create a set of linked stones at the nodes for Pansy and Smart Cookie and I stay at the third node to act as the control element. Since I won&#039;t be channelling the power directly, I can avoid being overloaded. I can even help you control your power.”</p><p class="double">She noticed the approaching genie. “Uh oh... No time for more lessons, I&#039;ll need help setting it up, and you need some spells of your own. I can copy some of my own knowledge into your mind, it&#039;ll only work for a half hour before they fade, but at least you&#039;ll be able to defend yourself. Drop the water in the river...”</p><p class="double">Lauren still wasn&#039;t sure about acting as a magical battery for these three, but learning spells was something she was right behind. She dropped the water. “Okay! What do I do?”</p><p class="double">“Just touch your horn to mine.” Clover stepped in front of her, and lowered her head slightly to point her horn directly at the alicorn. Lauren lowered her own head to touch horns, and Clover&#039;s horn glowed slightly. “Darn! I don&#039;t have enough power even for this... will the knowledge to come to you, apply your power, but gently, gently.”</p><p class="double">Lauren took a deep breath, and tried gently – ever so gently, to will a copy of Clover&#039;s knowledge of spells into her mind. </p><p class="double">There was a <b>flash</b> of light. </p><p class="double"><i>She was nervous and it felt like there were butterflies in her tummy, all trying to escape. She had just been chosen by the great unicorn mage, Starswirl, to be his student after pleading to learn magic. She was determined, but still there was fear that she wouldn&#039;t be up to the task. She resolved to master as many aspects of magic as she could.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Tomes, books, and figures all spread out on an old oaken desk. A single candle burning away as she took a deep breath and cast the first spell she had created all on her lonesome. Waking up bleary eyed from the resultant explosion and crawling over to a scorched scroll to mark down not only another failure, but another step closer to success. Spell formulas and magical diagrams raced through her mind.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Making light of her teacher&#039;s new beard, calling it ridiculous. His reply was to laugh and something even more ridiculous to draw attention away from his facial hair, like putting silly bells in his hat.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Standing at her teacher&#039;s side as he tended to King Platinum&#039;s growing illness. Overhearing the whispers of the unicorn nobles as they planned their power plays and schemes. She didn&#039;t really think any pony would really start blaming the pegasi for the growing number of gryphon incursions or the earth ponies for the rising cost of food. It was only logical that the blame should fall on the gryphon marauder raids which the pegasi were fighting off. Therefore they could not manage the weather as efficiently, and thus the harvest wasn&#039;t as great.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Why weren&#039;t more ponies logical? At the gathering of the three tribes, she had met only two others who could see the truth – an earth pony and a pegasus.

She added another layer of enchantment on her cloak. They had a name now. Windigos. The current theory was that whatever spawned the horrid changelings, made their inverse. Beings who feed on hate and anger, rather than love and friendship. So far, there were no solid theories on how to defeat them.

The paradise state was no longer. The survivors made their decision. Taking only what could be carried or hauled in wagons, the ragged freezing members of each pony tribe started off in their own direction. The long exodus had begun.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>Cold. So many lost to the cold. And the windigoes seemed to be following them, gaining on the caravan. This meant the volunteers who stayed behind to distract them were no more. Her tears froze before they hit the ground.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>The leaders should protect their people. Starswirl stayed behind to research and coordinate the last effort – a mass teleportation spell that would require every remaining capable unicorn to cast. It would have the power to send only the foals and the surviving elderly to someplace safe. Someplace far away. Clover volunteered to go with her princess to draw off the windigos. She did not expect to see her two friends and their respective leaders attempting the same thing.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double"><i>A touch of harmony. That is what Starswirl called the harmonic resonance created by the three pony tribes. The earth ponies channelled their stamina, the pegasus ponies channelled their atmospheric control, and the unicorn spell tied them all together as each wished for the same thing with all their might. With all their hearts and with all their souls. And the windigoes were no more.</i></p><p class="double"><b>Flash.</b></p><p class="double">Lauren&#039;s horn slowly pulled away from Clover, who was staring at her in wide-eyed horror. What she had done was a crime of the gravest nature. A pony&#039;s mind was their own, a sacred refuge that should never be invaded; and that alicorn... she... she... she was hugging her.</p><p class="double">The alicorn cried as she tightly hugged the smaller filly. A barely audible whisper sounded in Clover&#039;s ear, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;m so, so sorry.&quot; </p><p class="double">Clover&#039;s shock melted away like snow under dragonflame, replaced by pity as she realised just what the other pony had experienced. She raised her fore-hoof and hugged back. &quot;No, I&#039;m sorry. I didn&#039;t think, if my own magic wasn&#039;t powerful enough to push the memories I wanted to give you, it wouldn&#039;t be powerful enough to limit what you&#039;d receive when you drew on them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe I wanted you to understand, and that makes it even worse. I wouldn&#039;t consciously forced any-pony to endure the memories of the hardships we went through, especially some-pony who clearly comes from a gentler place. But we must go ahead from what is, can you forgive me for any hurt I caused you? At least you should now have my spells, and the memories of my own training, which should make your control better.&quot;</p><p class="double">Genie Spike now towered over the square, his eyes lighting on the vampony who was still duking it out with the werewolf (a were-pony would imply that someone turned into a pony under the full moon... actually, sign me up!). He bowed his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;My Mistress Rarity, I am here to serve you. What is your command?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy winced. &quot;Oh frozen waste! This can&#039;t be good! I think the stalemate just turned into a checkmate!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash didn&#039;t know exactly how long she&#039;d kept Rarity and AJ from tearing each other apart, but she figured it was more then long enough for an amnesiac alicorn to fly to Sweet Apple Acres, learn magic, and return with the Cutie Mark Crusaders in tow. This was primarily based on her observation of a Fausticorn having a conversation with three foals while levitating a sphere of water; admittedly that wasn&#039;t a very accurate measurement of time, but the fact remained that whoever the Fausticorn actually was – definitely a looper, anyway – she wasn&#039;t acting as a creator of worlds but more like a very confused fangirl. Which kind of made sense in a way.</p><p class="double">&quot;هيا لكم اثنين، مجرد التوقف عن هذا. نحن جميعا أصدقاء هنا. كنت ما زلت لا أفهم كلمة وأنا أقول هل.&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Come on you two, just stop this. We&#039;re all friends here. You still don&#039;t understand a word I&#039;m saying do you.</span></p><p class="double">&quot;Wretched cur! Kneel before my glory!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AWOOOOOOO!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;هذه هي سابع معظم قصة رعب مبتذلة لقد سبق إختطف في,&quot; Rainbow muttered to herself. &quot;الفروع، واسمحوا يكون هناك نوعا من تطور مؤامرة ...&quot;</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">This is the seventh most cliche horror story I&#039;ve ever been shanghaied into. Branches, PLEASE let there be some sort of plot twist...</span></p><p class="double">&quot;My Mistress Rarity,&quot; boomed a voice, &quot;I am here to serve you. What is your command?&quot;</p><p class="double">Oh. Well that was probably bad.</p><p class="double">Mummy Dash, lady Belle, and Applewolf, all turned to see the dragon genie towering over the small town of Ponyville. Rarity and Applejack were slightly stunned, having apparently not remembered this among all the other things that their costumes had made them forget. Rainbow Dash, however, was working her mind furiously. What did she know about genies? Wishes, untold power, Twilight said they were Saddle-Arabian in origin--</p><p class="double">Wait. Wasn&#039;t Saddle Arabia near the old Sphinx Empire? Well, at least she remembered it being there in the loops where she raced around the world... And mummies were a Sphinx Empire thing. So maybe, just maybe--</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, I...&quot; Rarity composed herself. &quot;...am most happy to see you--&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash suddenly shouted, her strange words flying through the air.</p><p class="double">The dragon genie blinked. &quot;She wants to... truly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;نعم!&quot; Rainbow nodded quickly, emphasizing her words with a strange gesture.</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Yes!</span></p><p class="double">&quot;You can understand this mare?&quot; Rarity looked from the mummy to the genie. &quot;What is she saying?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She... claims you wish to...&quot; Spike blushed a bit, trailing off.</p><p class="double">The vampire blinked.</p><p class="double">She looked at the genie.</p><p class="double">There was a quiet moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... you do seem to have some talent in the arts of shapeshifting...&quot; she mused. &quot;And I do rather need some relaxation after dealing with this disgusting beast. Come then! We shall away to my castle!&quot;</p><p class="double">With a flash, genie and vampire disappeared. Rainbow Dash gave a musty breath of relief.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Apple Bloom or whoever she thought she was coughed. &quot;Well... that was... disturbing.&quot; She gave the mummy a look. &quot;Did you really...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash shrugged, shuffling a hoof and glancing away. &quot;مهلا، ما اذا كان يعمل يعمل.&quot; She hadn&#039;t been sure that the genie would even understand her; it was really a massive stroke of luck.</p><p class="double"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hey, if it works it works.</span></p><p class="double">After a moment, Applejack started rolling on the ground with a whuffling laugh.</p><p class="double">Ignoring the happy wolf-pony for a moment, Lauren turned towards Smart Cookie, &quot;Wait, you could understand that mummy pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cookie notched her head to one side, &quot;Not exactly. From the way they reacted I could get the general gist. Figuring out what the other pony&#039;s not saying is pretty much a key skill in my job. And at least one word sounded similar to something I heard from a camel trader who came up past the Southern mountains. He wasn&#039;t my type though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s just... Clover seemed so knowledgeable,&quot; the alicorn said.</p><p class="double">Clover sighed and rolled her eyes, &quot;Because you were talking about magical spells. You have my memories, you should know while I&#039;ve studied many things, languages aren&#039;t one of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Speaking of which, Lauren, do you think you can manage a translation spell?&quot; Pansy asked. &quot;It should prevent any other confusion.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren thought through her new memories for a moment before recalling Clover learning, practising, and managing one such spell, &quot;I think so. Hold on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gathering in her horn what to her felt like a tiny iota of her power, the alicorn imprinted the spell matrix of what she wanted the magic to do; linking concepts with spoken and written words. And in one pulse, she let the magic out. A wave of pale blue engulfed the nearby ponies, then the nearby buildings, then the nearby country side; then everything was pale blue for a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;That, may have been a little too much power,&quot; Lauren stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t say, you strange pony-bird,&quot; said the small blue jay that was sitting on a nearby tree, &quot;Oh, I smell food over that way. Maybe the nice yellow pony-bird left some out again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nuts, nuts, nuts. I got to find the tasty nuts and hide them before the cold comes,&quot; sang a nearby squirrel as it raced along the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot; happily greeted Winona the dog as she raced along. She spotted the wolf pony whose scent was almost the same as her old friend/master/alpha female, except she was a wolf pony now – which made her even better! &quot;Hey! Hey!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey!&quot; yipped Applejack, &quot;Play?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay!&quot; barked Winona as the two raced off together.</p><p class="double">Somewhere, a strange winged wasp/crab/mushroom creature suddenly understood the odd beings around it. It also seemed to possess a strange desire to compile all the recipes and desserts from its culture, for some reason. &#039;<i>To serve Mi-go&#039;, that it was a cookbook should be inherently understandable, right?</i> it thought.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can you understand me now?&quot; Mummy Dash asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;We can.&quot; came from Lauren and the three former cutie mark crusaders.</p><p class="double">&quot;Great! Finally!&quot; exclaimed the mummy, &quot;So... er... any ideas what&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We were hoping you could tell us,&quot; Smart Cookie asked. &quot;This entire town seems to have gone insane! As witness I&#039;m talking to a dead person wrapped in bandages.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, this is just a costume, remember?&quot; Dash looked quizzically at them.</p><p class="double">Pansy shook her head. &quot;Uh huh, I&#039;ve seen too many dead pegasi not to know one when I see one. Look at your wings, you can see the bones through the feathers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash grimaced, not bothering to look at her wing. &quot;I suppose Private Pansy would be an expert?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The name is Lieutenant Pansy.&quot; The younger pegasus looked up at the older one, surprised by the lack of recognition. &quot;You know, second in command to Commander Hurricane? For that matter, who and what are you, and why are you still moving around? Some weird magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw great! The same thing&#039;s happened to you three hasn&#039;t it?&quot; Rainbow Dash facehooved. &quot;You guys think you&#039;re really the three founders!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And who do you think we are? For that matter, who do you think you are?&quot; Clover asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well I&#039;m Rainbow Dash, most awesome flyer in Equestria, and I dressed up as a mummy for Nightmare Night, from &#039;Daring Do and the Pyramid of the Ancients&#039;. I was going to do Daring Do but the pith helmet I ordered didn&#039;t come in time. So I did the mummy instead. Pretty quick fix, just wrapped some layers of TP around myself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity and Applejack had just gotten into their costumes when the world went wobbly for a second, and then they <i>really</i> got into their costumes. Rarity was doing the whole &#039;Queen of the Night&#039; thing, and Applejack went to the dogs. I haven&#039;t seen them fight like that since... well, I wasn&#039;t actually around for Twilight&#039;s sleepover, but I heard the screams.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I ended up like this...&quot; She finally did examine her wing, and looked ill at the moth-eaten condition. &quot;It&#039;s like we&#039;ve all been changed into our costumes, only they changed inside as well as out, though maybe not completely if Spike and Rarity are still into each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re making no sense!&quot; Clover said in an exasperated voice. &quot;For that matter neither does this town, or this festival, &#039;Nightmare Night&#039; as you call it. It has been a scant dozen years since the Exodus, how could this town be so well developed? And you speak as if we should know those ponies. We woke up here only hours ago, having been snatched away and somehow de-aged and stripped of our emblems – our cutie marks. </p><p class="double">&quot;We must contact Chancellor Puddinghead, or my mentor Starswirl, as this must be some ploy by the old guard to try and split the three tribes by depriving them of the focus around which the Alliance is built. They tried to take our memories too, but our friendship must have protected them. They must have believed that bringing us up as unaware friends would maintain the Fire of Friendship while removing us as political figures.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash shook her head, dislodging some dust which made her sneeze. &quot;Celestia, you three have it bad. Still, you three spent enough time studying at Twilight&#039;s to get your costumes just right. I guess some of it rubbed off.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What in the frozen wastes do you mean?&quot; Pansy exclaimed, &quot;Are you claiming we are some sort of magical copies, created by some spell?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All I know is that the three of you still look like Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo under those costumes, and that the three of you were going to dress as Smart Cookie, Clover the Clever and Private Pansy for Nightmare Night. You do the maths.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celly pondered what she&#039;d been told, and the disturbing shift in Nightmare Moon&#039;s... <i>Nimmy&#039;s</i> personality.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t that the other personality was abhorrent. <i>By Ash and Elder, the sweet thing is not abhorrent at all.</i> It was the moments of struggle and the changeover that disturbed her most. Her own spike of curiosity and dry cataloguing of the symptoms, and the fact that her tiara was gently pulsing magic, letting her see a trio of spectral butterflies flitting across Nimmy&#039;s cutie mark. Celly felt the ache in her heart of not only fighting to save the &quot;Lulu&quot; at the heart of &quot;Nimmy&quot; but trying to save the pegasus inside as well.</p><p class="double">She also worried about the fact she wasn&#039;t as worried about the lost soul potentially within herself. What she was really worried about was that sudden surge of alicorn magic across town. Oh, and the apparent dragon genie.</p><p class="double">&#039;Here we go again, Celestia,&#039; she thought as the elder diarchs swung their own heads to search for the source of the disturbance. Celly frowned at the sarcastic bent of the thought.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">&quot;So...&quot; Faust said slowly. &quot;One of my creations who I haven&#039;t created yet dressed up like, and became a copy of, myself. So, I&#039;m probably writing this right now and threw in a self-insert as an in-joke.&quot; She groaned. &quot;I hate me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash sighed. &quot;Actually... how do I put this. Let me think.... You&#039;re kind of a metajoke. See, Celestia and Luna&#039;s mother was named Faust, and there&#039;s this recent sort of comedy series where...&quot; The mummy waved a bandaged hoof vaguely at the alicorn, well aware that mentioning the loops and a hub universe would probably make her lose all credibility. &quot;So... yeah, heh. Twilight could tell you more, she&#039;s the egghead.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie looked back and forth between the alicorn and the mummy incredulously. &quot;You can&#039;t possibly believe this load of horseapples! I&#039;m myself, not some ghost or shadow puppet created by some-pony&#039;s imagination! Clover, tell her...&quot;</p><p class="double">But Clover was standing very still, mumbling to herself. &quot;Emblems... memory... illusion... but that would mean...&quot;</p><p class="double">Her eyes widened and she swayed on her hooves. Then she turned to the other two and they were shocked to see tears in her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, by the Source! It makes sense, it&#039;s the only thing that makes sense! Look around you, this isn&#039;t our Equestria! You know I wondered why our emblems didn&#039;t restore themselves with our memories. Our memories and souls are intact, and an Emblem is an expression of our souls, our destinies. Magic capable of affecting that is beyond any-pony I know, and if some-pony had that much power, they wouldn&#039;t need to trick us, they could just rewrite the world to order. But if these bodies aren&#039;t our own, our souls and destinies can&#039;t affect them. That would explain why our emblems didn&#039;t appear.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her gaze grew distant, then focussed on something far away. &quot;Oh no, there was that, the whole time! Pansy, look up in the mountains!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy and Smart Cookie followed her gaze, where Canterlot blazed on the mountain above in it&#039;s own festival colours.</p><p class="double">&quot;But, there&#039;s no city like that anywhere!&quot; Pansy gasped. &quot;It&#039;s huge!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You lead most of the surveys, do you recognise the distinctive shape of that peak?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No... yes, Mount Canter, where the unicorns have that new mining camp! But there was nothing like that there, I swear it! And that would mean this is somewhere on the Everfree plains.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover turned to Dash, eyes dark. &quot;Two more questions. What&#039;s the name of that city, and how long is it since the exodus, since... us?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash didn&#039;t look happy about the way her comments had been received, and hesitated, but Clover&#039;s gaze held on her until she gave a sigh. &quot;Canterlot, the capital of Equestria. As to how long, I don&#039;t know, egg-head stuff isn&#039;t my thing, but more than a thousand years, a lot more.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie shook her head violently. &quot;No, I&#039;m not buying it! This has to be a trick, some kind of illusion to make us lose hope, this can&#039;t be the truth!&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover shook her head. &quot;I thought of that first, but it won&#039;t wash. There are too many unfamiliar things, too much change. Did you recognise even a tithe of those costumes, the styles of the housing? An illusion works by drawing you in, making your own mind do the hard work. Adding that many new elements would make it crack like cheap wattle, no matter how much raw power you threw at it. No, only reality hurts this much.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what about her, why does she remember what happened?&quot; Smart Cookie pointed at Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;From what she said, that &#039;mummy&#039; costume was a last minute thing, whereas our costumes were a labour of love. Maybe the more effort some-pony put into the costume, the deeper the change goes.&quot; She sniffled back her tears and asked Dash. &quot;If they made costumes of us, ponies still remember us, even after all this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash was feeling as rotten as she looked for how she&#039;d hurt them, and saw a way to make up for it a bit. &quot;Are you kidding? You&#039;re the Founders, the ponies who started it all! You saved every-pony, founded Equestria, we even have a holiday just to celebrate it, Hearth&#039;s warming Eve! You&#039;re the most famous ponies in the history of... history!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then we succeeded?&quot; Clover asked hopefully. &quot;The three tribes learned to live together?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just look at the three of you.&quot; Dash pointed at them. &quot;Scoots, Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom are the best of friends. They may fight occasionally, but I&#039;ve never heard them fight because they&#039;re not the same race. Just the idea that ponies could do that freaks most ponies out, it&#039;d be like ponies fighting because they had different coat colours or mane styles. Doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t have some problems, but yeah, you guys did it, big time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s something, at least.&quot; Clover sighed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She tried to hold it in. She really did. But at the highly emotional moment when the three fillies-turned-historical-legends were wrapped up in the joy of knowing that their mission was a success, that the three pony tribes not only managed to live together in peace, but thrive; it just came out.</p><p class="double">Lauren spoke out, &quot;Buffy did it!&quot;</p><p class="double">All eyes turned towards the alicorn who now had her front hooves covering her mouth.</p><p class="double">She slowly lowered her hooves and took a deep breath, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. It just came to me. People turning into their costumes. I remembered something similar happening in a show I saw, but it was years ago.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What caused such an event?&quot; Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">Pansy chimed in, &quot;And how was it ended?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me think. There was a statue to a chaos god or something.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord,&quot; Rainbow Dash almost growled. It had been many, many relative years since before the loops started... but she still hadn&#039;t <i>completely</i> forgiven him for taking away her wings, &quot;He&#039;s the big-wig spirit of chaos around here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren nodded, &quot;Okay, and there was a chaos mage who kicked off the whole thing. Is there a pony around here that likes or worships chaos?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mummy Rainbow Dash gave off a long, dust-filled sigh, &quot;Pinkie Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a pause as the pegasus collected her thoughts. &quot;Imagine the living embodiment of a sugar high who likes to party, dance, sing, do completely impossible things, and then party even more and you&#039;ll pretty much know what she&#039;s like.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren smiled, fondly remembering one of her old pony dolls. &quot;Great. Now we just need to find where she has the statue and smash it. Then everyone will be back to normal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what happened to the assumed personas on this show?&quot; Clever Clover asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t really know,&quot; the alicorn said, &quot;The fillies you all are possessing may retain some of your memories and skills. The show I saw never showed what happened to the ones who possessed the costumed people.&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover nodded in understanding, &quot;A pity our real selves will never know of this. It would be a comfort knowing we will succeed beyond our expectations. Still, we can help, agreed?&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked at the other two. Pansy just nodded, but Smart Cookie gave a deep sigh and said, &quot;It&#039;s not given to a pony how long they live, but we can control how we use that time, even if it&#039;s only a single night. Freeing this town would be a good use of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So where would this Pinkie Pie have the chaos statue?&quot; Pansy questioned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sugarcube Corner.&quot; Rainbow Dash motioned to the others to follow her, &quot;The bakery that looks like a giant gingerbread cookie house. It makes that unicorn who wants to be a dentist growl every time she has to walk past it. It&#039;s this-a-way.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the group turned a corner, they came upon the assorted Celestias, Lunas, and Nightmare Moons. They all turned towards the new alicorn, eyes widening in recognition.</p><p class="double">A chorus of voices called out in hopeful amazement, &quot;Mother?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mother, is that... is that truly you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, sister, it is not her,&quot; Nightmare Moon snapped. &quot;Lest ye forget, this is the night of costumes, of which We and thou art also.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her face softened considerably. &quot;There&#039;s no reason to be rude, Nightmare.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren took a breath. &quot;I... um... Listen, dear... I&#039;m not exactly your mother. I... don&#039;t even have memories of you...&quot;</p><p class="double">The younger Celestia wilted. &quot;...I see...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, um... hugs?&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Celly&#039; stepped forward, almost teary eyed, and took the proffered embrace.</p><p class="double">Nightmare moon scoffed, then slapped herself. &quot;Ow! That was not necessary! Yes it was and you know it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash gave Nightmare Moon an odd look. &quot;What&#039;s up with you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re not exactly sure how, but Fluttershy managed to somewhat break through the ensorcellment.&quot; Luna stepped forward and nodded to the founders. &quot;It is an honour to be in your presence once more, even if you are not truly... well. The fact remains, we do require some assistance in organizing a reaction to... are you aware of what is happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;According to the Metajoke Faust over there,&quot; Rainbow Dash pointed at the red maned alicorn giving &#039;Celly&#039; an awkward smile, &quot;some servant of chaos made a chaos statue and now everyone&#039;s become their costumes. Kind of. I&#039;m still Rainbow Dash, I&#039;m just a mummy now, but the crusaders have... they&#039;re the founders, mind and soul.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A statue?&quot; Luna tilted her head. &quot;That&#039;s an... interesting idea-&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow leaned in close and whispered quickly. Luna&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;Oh. Right. That makes sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Tia&#039; shook her head. &quot;So, from all that, I assume... Pinkie Pie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It would make sense,&quot; Rainbow replied. &quot;Let&#039;s just head over to Sugarcube Corner and...&quot;</p><p class="double">She blinked. &quot;Is... is that a fire over there?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;NO! You are not going in there, Dinky, and that&#039;s FINAL!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, miss, I have to make sure that nopony&#039;s trapped in there! It&#039;s my job!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOU ARE NOT A FIREPONY!&quot; Derpy yelled, tears streaming down her face. &quot;YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER! I&#039;M NOT GOING TO LOSE YOU!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe I am!&quot; the filly snapped. &quot;Maybe I&#039;m your daughter and I&#039;m transformed and I don&#039;t remember anything about it! That doesn&#039;t change the fact that there is a building on fire! Even if nopony is in there, I have to stop it! Who else can?! Who else here has the knowledge, ability, and let&#039;s face it <i>sanity</i> to handle this?!&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus looked up at the blazing sugarcube corner. &quot;I... I...&quot; She sniffled. &quot;Just.... please. Try not to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I promise I&#039;ll come back.&quot; The firepony hugged her gently. &quot;Don&#039;t worry. I promise that I&#039;ll come back.&quot;</p><p class="double">And neither of them noticed the pink form flying away from the blaze, an odd little statue gripped in its claws as it glided toward the Everfree.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As soon as she started to get close to the burning building, Lieutenant Quick Deployment felt the heat of the burning blaze that was consuming the building and weakening its structural integrity. Her oxygen tank was almost empty and the backup from the station hadn&#039;t arrived yet, leaving her without much time to think. She needed to act fast and look for anyone still trapped in Sugarcube Corner. </p><p class="double">She touched the front door handle with her hoof and found it burning hot. Her fire axe swung telekinetically through the air, making some holes for the flames start to burst through and equalizing the oxygen inside. Quick Deployment steadied herself, taking a few steps back.</p><p class="double">Then she charged the door, bursting through with a single swing of her axe.</p><p class="double">&quot;PONYVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT!&quot; she shouted through her oxygen mask. &quot;IS ANYONE HERE? PLEASE ANSWER OR MAKE SOME NOISE SO I CAN GET TO WHERE YOU ARE!&quot; Her experienced eyes scanned the front of the business, quickly determining that the fire had started in the kitchens. The flames and her small body made said room inaccessible, but the stairs seemed to be safe. She rushed up, pressing her hoof against the first door she found. The heat forced her to recoil; with a sad glance, she moved on.</p><p class="double">The next room, thankfully, wasn&#039;t hot enough to be consumed by flames. She announced herself with a quick shout--&quot;&quot;PONYVILLE FIRE DEPARTAMENT! SOMEONE PLEASE RESPOND!&quot;--and quickly entered. It turned out to be a basic bathroom, and a quick search found nopony hiding in the tub or the cabinets. The room after that, the master bedroom, had a minor blaze already; fortunately, it was unoccupied. As Quick Deployment headed to the final room, she spared a glance at the stairs; tongues of fire were already licking up. Time was running out.</p><p class="double">Quick Deployment approached the final door, pressing against it. &quot;PONYVILLE FIRE DEPARTAMENT! IS ANYONE THERE?&quot; Unlike the other doors, there was actually some kind of noise! But it wasn&#039;t just any kind of noise; it was the one kind of noise she didn&#039;t want to hear in this situation. It was the crying of an infant foal.</p><p class="double">Without thinking twice she opened the door as fast as she could, noticing that it was filled with plush animals and other didactic toys; in the centre of the room was a cradle with a small yellow earth pony foal. The baby was wailing with all his little lungs could give him; Quick Deployment could sense the flames getting closer as she carefully lifted the small bundle of joy out of the crib. But the flames were already covering the hallway and getting inside the room, she could even hear the sound of the roof collapsing in the other places of the house; the structural integrity of the building wouldn&#039;t last much longer.</p><p class="double">Quick Deployment&#039;s mind raced as she placed the oxygen mask to the foal&#039;s face, looking around quickly – there! A window! Clutching the foal tightly to her chest, she steeled herself and ran toward it, leaping out just before a burst of fire destroyed the room!</p><p class="double"><i><b>BOOOOOOOOM!!!</b></i></p><p class="double">The force sent her further then she expected, but already she was curled around the infant and rolling on the ground... into a set of bushes. She sputtered, spitting out leaves as she clambered out. &quot;I&#039;m not doing this ever again if I can help it!&quot; Her eyes drifted toward the foal, and she sighed in relief as she saw him look back with wide eyes.</p><p class="double">Moment later she was wrapped up in a tight hug.</p><p class="double">&quot;DINKY! ARE YOU ALRIGHT MUFFIN?&quot; Derpy couldn&#039;t hold back the tears as she brough both the foals close. &quot;DOES SOMETHING HURT? PLEASE SAY SOMETHING!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ms. Hooves-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;DID YOU GET BURNED? DID ANY PIECE OF DEBRIS HIT YOU?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ms. hooves, I&#039;m fi-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;PLEASE DON&#039;T TELL ME YOU&#039;RE DYING! I CAN&#039;T LOOSE YOU THE SAME WAY I LOST YOUR FATHER! PLEASE DON&#039;T LEAVE ME AND YOUR SISTER ALONE!...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;MS. HOOVES! I WAS TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT I AM FINE! FINE!&quot; The firepony broke out of the hug with an exasperated sigh. &quot;Geeze, it was just a few scrapes... and the temporal pain of hitting my back with the oxygen tank when I landed, nothing out of routine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy sniffed, giving her a worried look. &quot;...Are you sure?&quot;</p><p class="double">Quick Deployment took a breath, calming herself. &quot;Yeah I&#039;m sure of it. This is not my first fire, Ms. Hooves, and I don&#039;t think it will be my last.&quot; She looked toward the burning building. &quot;What it worries me right now is how to extinguish the fire before it propagates to the nearby houses, calm down this little tyke, find his parents, get some water to drink, and get to the hospital for a checkup after this mess. That is in order from the top priority to the least one Ms. Hooves.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Ok, I guess I can help you with the first one,&quot; Derpy finally replied. &quot;I may not be Rainbow Dash, but if there&#039;s one thing I can handle a little better than her it&#039;s storm clouds. That will put out the fire and keep the other houses humid enough to not catching fire.&quot; She gave Sugarcube Corner a glance. &quot;Or, knowing my luck, set half the other houses on fire...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, what was the last part?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NOTHING! NOTHING AT ALL! Don’t worry about it, just leave it to me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... I trust your judgement Ms. Hooves. Please be quick in gathering the storm cloud, I don&#039;t think my buddies of the station will arrive in time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy saluted. &quot;Don&#039;t worry muffin, Mom is on the case.&quot; She gave a little nuzzle to the infant – before backing off with an odd expression. &quot;Wait... is that Carrot Cake? No, never mind, I don&#039;t want to know.&quot; Shaking her head, she took to the air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Having another alicorn bow to you was a disconcerting thing for the three Founders, especially as there were four more besides, though two were clearly copies of two others. However the fire distracted every-pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;We should go there with all speed, see if we can render aid.&quot; Pansy said, trying to lift-off to see better.</p><p class="double">&quot;In our present state I&#039;m not sure...&quot; Clover&#039;s eyes alighted on a spilled bag that had once been part of a pirate costume. The candy gems inside had been transmuted into real ones, likewise the chocolate gold pieces, and her eyes brightened up. &quot;Or maybe we can!&quot;</p><p class="double">She forked through them with a hoof, and levitated three of the biggest and finest, a diamond, a sapphire and an emerald, as well as some other odds and ends. &quot;We can work on the move.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie had gone over by Princess Luna as they moved off. &quot;You seem to know us personally, but I for one have never met you. Our memories seem to extend until a dozen years after the Alliance. But from what we&#039;ve been told that was well over a thousand years ago. Also, from Rainbow&#039;s reaction you are native to this time and place. Who are you, and how can this be, if you don&#039;t mind me asking?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am Princess Luna, Ruler of Night and Guardian of Dreams, and my sister is Princess Celestia, Ruler of the Day and Protector of Ponykind. We now raise the sun and moon, rather than a team of unicorn nobles.&quot;</p><p class="double">Smart Cookie&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;But that would deprive the unicorn nobility of the largest portion of their power! That would be... it would change everything!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed it did... but that is not what you asked. You were very old when we met you, only alive because of Clover&#039;s spells, but even then you were an inspiration. We alicorns on the other hoof are immortal, or rather unaging.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean, you have lived that entire time from then to now? Then it is the two of you who are truly responsible for this world, not we... your highness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna shook her head. &quot;Only because we had your example to guide us. You, of all ponies need not use our titles. Indeed, the Elements of Harmony were a development of Clover&#039;s elaboration of Starswirl&#039;s original research into the nature of magic and it&#039;s connection to the minds and emotions of all three pony races.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Elements of Harmony?&quot; Smart Cookie asked.</p><p class="double">Fausticorn and Clover had been talking, and casting spells on the floating gems. Finally, Clover came back to the other two carrying two chokers. The third, containing a diamond, was around her neck. &quot;Lauren agreed to lend us some of her power, and I transfered my design for a way to relay it along with my other memories. She helped craft these, and it should give all three of us at least a measure of our adult powers. She even suggested an improvement. I was too wedded to the idea of a physical ritual diagram, drawn on the ground. These form a ritual triune, but the links between the vertices use our friendship as the conduit. It&#039;s a fascinating idea, I only wish my real self could benefit from it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her expression saddened for a second, but she quickly recovered, and she put the chokers around the other two&#039;s necks, the sapphire for Pansy and the emerald for Cookie.</p><p class="double">Pansy started flapping her wings like a hummingbrd, but this time she took off like a Harrier jump-jet. &quot;Now this is more the business!&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia overheard the comment Clover made and asked, &quot;Why do you say that? You are as real as any-pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No we&#039;re not, we&#039;re simply far better copies than most. The enchantment on the costumes made us unusually detailed, but we will vanish along with the spell.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eyes widened in surprise. &quot;So that&#039;s what you meant! You told me once, that if I ever found you doubting you existed, to tell you the following phrase. &#039;He should have been called Levelhead.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover giggled. &quot;Oh that old chestnut. Smart Cookie always said her boss should be... Wait, how could we know that if we&#039;re just gestalts created by magic! That was a private thing between the three of us, we swore never to reveal it...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s horn glowed slightly. &quot;I think the spell did something different in your case, brought your souls forward in time. I can sense the difference between you and Fluttershy or Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Does that mean when the spell ends we will return to our real bodies?&quot; Hope dawned in Smart Cookie&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. &quot;It would make sense. I don&#039;t know how much you will remember, but enough to tell me that phrase to use.&quot;</p><p class="double">They&#039;d reached the burning building, which had half collapsed, and Rainbow Dash yelled out &quot;Sugar Cube Corner!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Quick Deployment gave an exasperated sigh. &quot;Great, more civili–Your Majesties!&quot; She bowed quickly, careful not to let her magical grip drop the infant she was carrying. &quot;I can personally reassure you that the building is vacated, I went through and got everypony out. One of the local pegasi is... why are there seven of you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Costume curse,&quot; Clover explained simply. &quot;As far as we can tell, everypony became their.... Nightmare Night, was it? Nightmare Night costumes...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance picked the infant up gently, rocking him to sleep and giving a reassuring wing hug to the shivering alicorn filly she had been tending to. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, Erroria, this brave firepony managed to save everyone in the blaze.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t like fire,&quot; the filly sniffled, unaware of her glowing horn. &quot;I want it gone!&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire area was suddenly subjected to a three second deluge. Founder, alicorn, mummy, and firepony all stood, blinking the water out of their eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Quick Deployment said slowly. &quot;I... guess that&#039;s one way to put out a fire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy glided down, mussing up the firepony&#039;s mane. &quot;Did I do that? I&#039;m sorry! I didn&#039;t mean to!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aaaaaand now I&#039;m disintegrating,&quot; Dash deadpanned. &quot;Great.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice trailed off in a gurgle as she collapsed in a heap of sodden linen and bones before every-pony&#039;s horrified gaze. The pile <i>rippled</i>, and suddenly it was a regular blue pegasus swathed in soaking toilet paper. She spat out a mouthful. &quot;Ugh! The toilet paper should be on the houses, not me! Never doing that again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course!&quot; Clover exclaimed. &quot;The curse changes you into your costume, so damage done to your assumed form is damage done <b>to</b> the costume! So even if your costume form is killed or destroyed, all that happens is you revert to normal with a wrecked costume. Ingenious!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss,&quot; Smart Cookie asked the fire-pony, &quot;Did you see some sort of statue or bust in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to the group. &quot;What does this Discord creature look like anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy was up in the air, converting the steam rising off the smouldering wreckage into clouds and chilling them to suck the last remnants of heat out of the destroyed building. &quot;It must have been pretty durable to survive this, and it must have. We&#039;re still here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia was casting about with her horn, looking like a giant white bloodhound. &quot;It&#039;s possible it didn&#039;t need to. The aura of Chaos magic is strong, but it&#039;s not centred inside the building. It seems to lead off towards the Everfree Forest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, that about figures!&quot; grumbled Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sister, thou do believe some villain absconded with it and set the place afire the place to cover his tracks?&quot; Luna asked. &quot;Then we must give chase with all haste!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked at the wrapped up foal Cadance was currently holding which had been saved from the fire, and raised an eyebrow. Carrot Cake should be a full-grown stallion, baker, and warden... er... employer of Pinkie Pie; and yet there he was as an infant. She chalked it down to more weirdness from the spell.</p><p class="double">All the now dry alicorns and founders were setting up a spell to better locate the perpetrator of the fire. All the alicorns except the small filly which Rainbow had never seen before.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello. So, who might you be?&quot; The newly demummified pegasus asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Erroria,&quot; said the filly alicorn, &quot;Do you know where my mother is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who is your mother, little one?&quot; Quick Deployment asked after looking sadly at the wet remains of the bakery. She was used to working with a full team of mixed ponies to put out fires before they got this bad. Ideally, there would also be a few fully-laden rainclouds on hoof at the station.</p><p class="double">Erroria thought for a little while before remembering, &quot;My mother is Princess Skyla!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash spoke up, &quot;And do you know your grandmother&#039;s name?&quot;</p><p class="double">The little alicorn filly thought for a moment. Then she pointed at the alicorn who was holding the foal, &quot;Grandma Candy!&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Cadance stopped rocking the foal as her eyes shrunk down to pinpricks.</p><p class="double">Rainbow&#039;s wings fluttered as comprehension hit her, &quot;Right. Princess Cadence&#039;s granddaughter. From the future. With everything else crazy around here, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Any luck with tracing the statue?&quot; the actual Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">Luna turned around with a smile, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr><hr></p><p class="double">It had finished the cookbook it had been compelled to write, and cast the appropriate protection spells on the tome. Fluttering out of the window, the fungal creature had skittered around the chaos outside, casually pulling information of the local language from the minds of several of the afflicted. That was when it overheard what was happening. There was a chance it could simply stop existing once the aetherial conflagration was through; and that was unacceptable.</p><p class="double">Once it was back at the bakery, the focal point statue was easy to locate. Snatching it up in its claws, the Mi-go fluttered out the window. A brief burst of personal power later, and everything in the room, except the cookbook, was on fire.</p><p class="double">Half-flying, half scuttling in the wild magic forest with the statue, distracted by deflecting scrying spells; it never noticed that something was watching it.</p><p class="double">Right up until a small furry foot impacted it in the back of its head. Its last thought before losing consciousness was that of confusion. How was it possible that it was hit with far more force that a bandana and war-paint wearing white rabbit had any right to wield?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Quick, this way!&quot; Luna took off in the Everfree Forest&#039;s direction, and her companions quickly followed suit.</p><p class="double">The group of ponies, increasingly consisting of alicorns, soon reached the forest&#039;s outskirts, where a... creature, part fungus, part shrimp and part... something, was rising from the dirt, hissing and swinging its tail at-</p><p class="double">&quot;Angel Bunny!&quot; Nightmare Moon&#039;s gaze shifted mid-sentence. &quot;Well, done, master ra- No! Bad bunny! I mean, no! Well done, Angel! I mean- Oh, wilst thou DECIDE, ALREADY!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny gave the mare a confused look, but then puffed out his chest and adjusted his bandanna, after which he turned around to face the Mi-Go again – who was in the middle of trying to sneak away. For its trouble, it received a bunny kick to the shin – or... whatever that was – and doubled over backwards.</p><p class="double">While Nightmare Moon was still bickering with herself, Lauren stepped forward and looked the strange creature over. &quot;Nah, Lovecraftian horrors don&#039;t really fit a setting intended for young audiences.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ignoring their creator&#039;s avatar&#039;s shadow&#039;s comment, Tia stepped forward and took a telekinetic hold of the statuette of Discord in the Mi-Go&#039;s claws – or better tried to, as suddenly the creature leapt up and whipped around, its wings buzzing for take-off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Smart Cookie took a far more direct approach. &quot;Clover, give me a boost!&quot;</p><p class="double">She jumped, and a burst of magic flung her at the creature, dropping her on its back and bearing it to the ground. Lieutenant Pansy helped to pony-pile the thing, and a glow of magic pressed it against the floor, binding it to the ground as Clover added her efforts to restraining the thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s... still fighting!&quot; She said. &quot;Someone needs to destroy that statue now! Lauren, it&#039;s been a privilege and a pleasure. I hope the story you write brings joy to many fillies and colts. Princesses, I speak for us all when I say, thank you for continuing our work.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a chorus of agreement from the other two.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lauren picked up the statue in her magic. She giggled for a moment as it hovered and glowed. &quot;Hee hee, I&#039;m Jean Grey! Alright, alright, don&#039;t give me that look. Time for serious--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You would kill children?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lauren froze.</p><p class="double">&quot;I do not claim to find anything wrong in it,&quot; Chrksxcin continued calmly. &quot;But I know by your morality it is... odd. Destroying that statue would eliminate the personae that they have taken. The spawn, in particular, must concern you.&quot; It nodded toward Cadance, who was shielding her potential granddaughter and the regressed Carrot Cake with her wings. &quot;And that is only amongst those you are aware of. Certainly, it would be far less... disturbing to leave it untouched?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow snorted. &quot;Hey, I turned back to normal easy peasy. It&#039;s not going to kill anypony if she--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were still who you were,&quot; the Mi-Go countered, &quot;if different in form. And perhaps it could be argued that these three will return, so all the replicas of truth will be sent back with only confusion. But what of you and I?&quot; It turned back to Lauren. &quot;We have no home. We are constructs. And how many in that town are constructs themselves? We will melt away. Do you truly want that much of reality to cease?&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn looked at the statue in her magical grip.</p><p class="double">&quot;...If I had a choice,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I would take the constructed identities and make them separate bodies. But... I don&#039;t know how to do that. And if I could I would go out and ask every one of them if they would accept this. But... right here, right now... you and I are dangerous. In very different ways, yeah, but I don&#039;t...&quot; She shivered. &quot;I... I can&#039;t--&quot;</p><p class="double">Unexpectedly the statue sighed and snapped its fingers, metamorphosing into a multicoloured chimera with a grumpy frown. &quot;Let me just cut off all the drama here: The spell only lasts until sunlight hits the costume. The statue never had anything to do with ending it. Oh, and the constructed personae are actually facets of the costume makers and will rejoin with their mind when they disappear. Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I need to go see what chaos is happening in Ponyville. Ta-ta!&quot; He walked off from the stunned onlookers.</p><p class="double">Eventually Celestia facehooved. &quot;Of course Discord would pull something like that. Gruuugh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The solution is clear,&quot; Chrksxcin said calmly. &quot;You and I merely need to avoid sunlight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, sure, you know what?&quot; The red maned alicorn snorted. &quot;You do that. I&#039;ve just been put through an emotional wringer and then told it didn&#039;t even matter.&quot; She stomped off, muttering curses under her breath.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Smart Cookie cleared her throat. &quot;Does this mean we should let this thing go?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So it was true, after all,&quot; the false day alicorn said as she tested her wings after they started to brighten, realizing they had lost some sensibility and were much more difficult to move. &quot;I&#039;m just an illusion or an echo of a memory, am I not?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna and Celestia stopped and looked to the fake alicorn but she was looking at the moon in the sky, her eyes with unshed tears. &quot;Please, there&#039;s no need to hide it for me. I may recognize we are near the Everfree forest but there are so many things I don&#039;t understand about tonight, starting with both of you and this Ponyville. And since I&#039;m just an illusion then it means it won&#039;t matter if I do this.&quot; Then the fake Celestia threw herself to Luna, crying and hugging her fiercely. &quot;Lulu! I thought I&#039;d never see you again, sister. I&#039;m so happy to see you like this, so grown up!&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna just hugged and petted back.</p><p class="double">Letting go slightly of Luna, the ensorcelled Celestia looked to the real one. &quot;And you, real me, I don&#039;t know how much what&#039;s worth the opinion of your echo but thank you. I envy you so much but now I can disappear with no regrets.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia just shook her head. &quot;Don&#039;t thank me, I didn&#039;t do anything. It took a new set of Element bearers to help Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then please give my thanks to them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna contained her giggle into a lopsided smile, mimicking Celestia&#039;s own expression &quot;Will do Celly, we promise.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well that was certainly interesting,” Twilight muttered to herself. “It’s definitely going in my... hmm.. top fifty weirdest loops. Well, at least it’s over now.”</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the library door. She stood up and walked over, opening it to find the worried faces of three cutie mark crusaders.</p><p class="double">“Hey there girls! What’s going on?”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shifted a hoof, giving her an awkward glance. “You know how we... well, the founders made necklaces to boost their power?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Yeah... they didn’t transform back to candy, did they?”</p><p class="double">“...No,” Scootaloo confirmed. “They didn’t. But it gets weirder.”</p><p class="double">“Really? How?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle pulled the necklaces out of her saddlebags. “Well... when we wear them, we can hear... voices.”</p><p class="double">Raising an eyebrow, Twilight took the necklaces and ran a quick check over them for dangerous magic before slipping one on.</p><p class="double"><i>As far as I can tell, Cookie, that spell I had the alicorn cast that night dragged our souls forward after we died. No, Pansy, I don’t think it’s reversible! Oh, wait, I’m being worn. Hello there! I’m Clover, yes, that Clover, it’s a long story...</i></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='37'></a><h3>Loops 35</h3>
<p>35.1</p><p class="double">“Okay, I have a plan,” Twilight said, looking around at the assembled loopers. “Well, more of a competition, really.”</p><p class="double">“Go on...” Dash said, ears perking up.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Basically, we each take a turn handling all the big, important problems – solo. One Loop each.” Twilight paused for effect. “And we&#039;re only allowed to use our base-line abilities, plus the powers from at most <i>one</i> other loop.”</p><p class="double">Spike raised a claw. “Does my size-shifting count?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but it&#039;s that or the Force. Not both.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I think I see...” Rarity nodded. “You&#039;re trying to make it as equal as possible, dear?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Not fair that I have an advantage just for having looped so much longer than the rest of you – well, except in that I might be quite a lot more sneaky.”</p><p class="double">“As if,” Trixie said.</p><p class="double">That caused everypony, -ling, -dragon, -griffin and even -bunny to give her an incredulous look. (Discord was drinking upside-down tea, and didn&#039;t react.)</p><p class="double">“...I <i>might</i> not have been talking about myself,” Trixie said, slowly and carefully.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis hummed. “Do I count as automatically defeating myself?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but you don&#039;t get points for style unless you do it <i>with</i> style.” Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s going to be fairly normal for our loops,” Nyx said, nodding up at Luna. “Didn&#039;t you once take over the world, then give it back five minutes later &#039;cause there wasn&#039;t enough cheese?”</p><p class="double">Luna made a small gesture with one hoof. “I do try.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Shining Armor said. “Here goes.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned at him. “Go get &#039;er, B.B.B.F.F. I checked – she&#039;s not Awake.”</p><p class="double">“Good.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon finished her speech, cackled a bit, and flared her wings for effect.</p><p class="double">Two guards steadied their spears and prepared to charge-</p><p class="double">“Stand down, men,” a voice said.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll handle this.”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” she said, coming back to all fours and looking the unicorn stallion up and down, with a measuring glance. “One of Celestia&#039;s guard-whelps?”</p><p class="double">“Captain Shining Armor, at her service.” Shining saluted smartly.</p><p class="double">“How touching,” Nightmare Moon said, and launched a dark-bolt at him.</p><p class="double">Something very peculiar happened, and a dark-bolt hit her in the side, with enough power to smash her off her hooves.</p><p class="double">She came back upright with a fluid grace, and snarled. “What just happened?”</p><p class="double">Shining smiled. “I couldn&#039;t possibly comment.”</p><p class="double">“Insolent-” Biting off the word harshly, she gathered more power and fired a spread of over a dozen seeker bolts, paying more attention this time. His horn was faintly glowing-</p><p class="double">Seeker bolts hit her in all four kneecaps, then her flanks, both wings, and the last five shot holes through her mane.</p><p class="double">“How did you do that?” she asked, flaring her wings and righting herself.</p><p class="double">“Justice will be done,” he replied enigmatically.</p><p class="double">More magic. This time, it was a single overpowered electron ram.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon was less surprised than she felt she should have been when an overpowered electron ram erupted from the stage beneath her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Shining Armor checked his gleaming uniform, frowned, and rubbed at some of the brightwork for a moment to clear off a near-invisible stain.</p><p class="double">“Hm...”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the two of them, then sidled over to her brother. “What have you been doing?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon said something unintelligible, and fell over.</p><p class="double">“Justice field,” Shining said, proudly. “I managed to get it to work just a few loops ago – so that&#039;s the one I&#039;m using, by the way. Basically, it turns back any offensive act on the perpetrator.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight looked the exhausted, heavily bruised alicorn over. “Any limits?”</p><p class="double">“Magic cost, immobility and that it doesn&#039;t discriminate,” he answered promptly. “I&#039;m working on them.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry, Rarity!” shouted the non-Looping Spike, brandishing a shovel. “I&#039;ll save you!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, Spike, don&#039;t-”</p><p class="double">Spike hit Nightmare Moon square on the back of the head with the shovel, grinned proudly, and fell over.</p><p class="double">“...oops,” Shining said guiltily. “Perhaps I should have warned him...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“I hate clever ponies,” Discord mumbled, from his current form on the floor.</p><p class="double">He was a suit of armour, as it happened.</p><p class="double">Shining shrugged. “Justice just is.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. “How long have you been waiting to tell that pun?”</p><p class="double">“About five months.”</p><p class="double">“Aha!” Discord said abruptly, and turned back into his normal self. “If I do things to you, it rebounds on me! So if I try to turn you into a draconequus, I&#039;m back!”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Shining nodded. “That is a disadvantage of the field, I will admit. It should be noted, however, that you can&#039;t actually do anything to anyone else while it&#039;s up.”</p><p class="double">Discord shrugged. “I can wait.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t think you can, actually,” Twilight replied. “I mean, you&#039;re seriously telling me <i>you</i> can sit there quietly and not do anything for five minutes?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Discord said. “Just watch me!”</p><p class="double">Brother and sister watched him.</p><p class="double">Ten seconds later, he threw back his head, shouted “I can&#039;t take it any more!” and turned himself back into a statue.</p><p class="double">“...that ended well,” Shining muttered.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and flared her horn. The statue vanished.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d you put it?” Shining asked, dropping the field.</p><p class="double">“Pinkie&#039;s room. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll sort itself out one way or another.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Darling...” Cadence said, frowning into one of the side rooms. “Why is there a maid staring devotedly at her own reflection?”</p><p class="double">Shining shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, I give up. He&#039;s been doing the dark magic thing for ten minutes, and I can&#039;t see any difference in either of us.”</p><p class="double">With a flash of magic, Shining dropped the justice field.</p><p class="double">Sombra simply stood there, horn gently glowing.</p><p class="double">Then started to snore.</p><p class="double">Shining blinked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I <i>see</i>,” Twilight said, nodding. “I think he just drained his own energy to the point he fell asleep.”</p><p class="double">Shining trotted over and poked the King&#039;s flank. No response.</p><p class="double">“What should we do with him?”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought. “I tend to put him in the cellars and lock the door, really... those doors have good locks.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.2 (Mandemon)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">This new loop had been... strange. Twilight could not put her hoof on what was wrong, but something was. She had narrowed it down to Celestia and Pinkie Pie, who didn&#039;t seem to be themselves. Yet, she could not find any proof of that they were Awake or had been replaced by someone. This loops&#039; memories provided no information that would differentiate from a vanilla loop.</p><p class="double">In the end, it didn’t matter. Pinkie Pie might throw an extra party here and there, and Celestia might have been running few extra gambits. Nothing major, so she left it be. One major difference really in this loop was that her brother had embarked on some campaign that she could not find any information. At the moment, she was at the Grand Galloping Gala, having prevented the worst mistakes, and was letting the party go on smoothly. The orchestra was playing some music piece she was not interested in.</p><p class="double">Then everything went to Tartatrus.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie appeared on the window.</p><p class="double">“THIS QUIET OFFENDS SLAANESH!” She shouted on top of her lungs, causing everyone to look at her. A massive tank burst through the wall, carrying equally massive speakers. “THINGS SHALL GET LOUD NOW!” A loud music began play from the speakers, pushing ponies back. She was about to do something about the matter, when she noticed something... interesting.</p><p class="double">Celestia had just transported another massive set of speakers and DJ-equipment into the room. At the same time, Vinyl Scratch entered, listened for a moment before shrugging and moving to the DJ-booth and began to play her own music.</p><p class="double">“YOU INTERRUPT!?” Pinkie Pie shouted in surprise</p><p class="double">“You call that music? THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT!” Vinyl shouted back before starting to drown out Pinkies music. Pinkie Pie grinned and Twilight witnessed the begin of Grand DJ-Battle.</p><p class="double">She walked to Celestia.</p><p class="double">“Want to tell me me the truth.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe, maybe not?” Celestia merely said, grinning.</p><p class="double">“That’s Tzeentch, pink one is Slaanesh,” A voice answered next to Twilight. She looked next to her and saw Chrysalis. “Name&#039;s Nurgle, how do you do?” Chrysalis, AKA Nurgle, asked, sipping some weird drink.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tzeentch? Slaanesh? Oh, the Chaos Gods. I guess that means Lemon Rush is somewhere too,&quot; Twilight said. Both Nurgle and Tzeentch gave a laugh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lemon Rush? Is that what you call Leman Russ? Oh boy, he is not going to hear end of this ever,&quot; Nurgle said, offering Twilight a drink.</p><p class="double">“I would not drink the punch while Nurgle is here. There is probably AIDS in it,” Tzeentch commented.</p><p class="double">“You offend me, my friend. OF COURSE there is AIDS in there, Nurgle said, offended. &quot;I just want to spread my love for people!&quot; Twilight merely looked between two, before sighing.</p><p class="double">“Anything else I should know?” she asked.</p><p class="double">“Your brother is currently building a Skull Throne from the skulls of... well, pretty much anything,” Nurgle said, earning a glare from Tzeentch. “What? Did I throw a wrench into your plans?”</p><p class="double">“You’re impossible,” Tzeentch said.</p><p class="double">“Oh, shut up, newbie, I have been existing much longer than any of you,” Nurgle said, taking another sip.</p><p class="double">“A Skull Throne?” Twilight asked, mentally cataloguing alternative Element bearers.</p><p class="double">“He’s Khorne. Khorne disapproves the lack of wanton violence.” Tzeentch said, before smiling. “I wonder what he thinks once he realizes that things he has been hunting are actually merely illusions.”</p><p class="double">At the moment, Braeburn walked in.</p><p class="double">“Been looking for you idiots,” he said, walking up to Tzeentch and Nurgle.</p><p class="double">“Empy, how you do? Had a fun loop?” Nurgle said in delight. “Come on, give me a hug!”</p><p class="double">Some hours lat,er Slaanesh and Vinyl Scratch were staring each other down. Both music systems had burned out, though &quot;Empy&quot;, AKA Emperor, had mentioned that Slaneesh should have been able to fix his/her/its system, but apparently decided to be a good sport. The two brohoofed and swore to have another go in near future. After Vinyl left, Slaanesh walked to the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks Tze, that was fun!&quot; she said. &quot;I love these loops, you always find people who perfect their trade.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I did own you one for the aid pulling that prank on Chtulhu. The upstart needed a lesson.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just wished the loop would end soon. Having five gods running around with entirely different moral system was not going to be fun.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked to the garden, where she saw Tzeentch and Slaneesh watching over the statue of Discord.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no, you are <i>not</i> waking him up. We had a deal, remember? No funny business and I won&#039;t kick your butts,&quot; She said to the two Chaos gods.</p><p class="double">&quot;Funny business?&quot; Tzeentch asked. &quot;Oh, this isn&#039;t one of those. Just doing something she insisted.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on Tzeensy, you know we have responsibility?&quot; Slaanesh said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Chaos God of debauchery, excess, pleasure, pain and selfishness lectures me of responsibility. Clearly the multiverse has a sick sense of humour.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, time up. Please explain to semi-mortal what is going on?&quot; Twilight managed to get out before the statue of Discord disappeared and confused Discord sat in it&#039;s place.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm? I&#039;m free? FREE AT LAST! MUAHAAHAA!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem, Discord?&quot; Tzeentch said, causing Discord to freeze in his place, before his head turned 180 degree to meet the eyes of two Chaos Gods.</p><p class="double">&quot;Weird, I could have sworn I heard-&quot; Slaanesh and Tzeentch abandoned their pony forms and took their &quot;standardized&quot; forms. &quot;Oh... Hello?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings. I am Tzeentch and this Slaanesh. We are here to teach you about how to do Chaos.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot; Discord managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You see, we think you are quite too... euclidean with your thing. Chocolate rain, really? What&#039;s the fun in <i>that</i>? Now, Chocolate that rains clouds that do not exist, while at the same time sing ode to Ice Cream, now there is the thing. Though you still need to make so that they occupy at least four locations at the same time,&quot; Slaanesh said. &quot;Now, you come with me and I shall teach you a trick or two.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HEY WAIT WHAT THE LET GO OFF ME STOP THAT-&quot; Discord shouted, while being dragged by an ear by Slaanesh. Twilight merely stared at the spectacle in front of her, before turning to Tzeentch who once again took the form of Celestia.</p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a long story. Slaanesh and Cegorach had this... fight over the soul of Harlequin. So, this one of the Slaanesh demons decides to give a try, in hopes of advancing in the ranks and tries to bring Slaanesh some drinks. Too bad I mixed them.” Tzeentch winked. “So, after taking a sip, Slaanesh threw the remainders at Cegorach, both suddenly found themselves very hot and bothered and when two Gods love each others very much-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Skip please.&quot; Twilight made a face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, Cegorach came to me and asked me for a help to solve this mess, since I caused it. In exchange of some... shall we say, favours, I agreed to fool Slaanesh. So when Slaanesh comes, having worst hangover <i>ever, </i>I took responsibility, making Khrone <i>very</i> pissed for no good reason.&quot; Tzeentch gave a snicker at this. &quot;Anyway, few millennium later we got this tiny Chaos God running around. However, Khrone got tired of the little runt after that incident with Slaanesh toys and his weapons and threw him into a rift in Chaos. Since then, for who knows reason, Slaanesh has claimed every single chaos elemental as her &#039;children&#039; and wants to teach them. And somehow I am to help her. Because I am the Daddy. I guess it&#039;s one those... well, can&#039;t really say &#039;Lady things&#039; but you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that explains... actually quite a lot.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, how much you are ready to pay to me that I don&#039;t reveal this to Slaanesh?&quot; Twilight said with a grin. Tzeentch face fell.</p><p class="double">&quot;You wouldn&#039;t dare?&quot;</p><p class="double">“Try me.&quot; </p><p class="double">The two stared each other for a moment, before Tzeentch gave a chuckle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remind me to show you around the Black Library next time you visit.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Four young children walked through the snowy pine forest, faces alight with wonder.</p><p class="double">This was really inside a wardrobe?</p><p class="double">A purple flash lit the snow in front of them.</p><p class="double">“Hello,” said a strange being, like a horse but with both wings and a horn. “Sorry I took so long, I don&#039;t know my way around here very well... aherm.”</p><p class="double">The apparition fluffed her wings – for the voice was clearly that of a her – and cleared her throat again. “Welcome, human children. I am Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re what?” asked the younger of the boys. “That&#039;s an absurd name.”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle looked at him, then examined her own wings. “Fair enough. I&#039;m a bit of an absurd being, by your standards. Anyway... as one of your number has already noticed, this world contains creatures with wit and voice, unlike your home. Long story short, I&#039;ve finally got here, and I&#039;m about to fix the weather.”</p><p class="double">She spread her wings, and light gathered itself about her horn.</p><p class="double">The sun rose, and it felt like a warm balm. It reminded the children more of midsummer than midwinter.</p><p class="double">“That should do it,” she muttered. “Now, where&#039;s Jadis... oh, where are my manners? There&#039;s a family of rather hospitable beavers around two hundred and fifty feet that way.”</p><p class="double">With that, the strange horse took to the air and winged away west.</p><p class="double">The children exchanged looks.</p><p class="double">“Well, I suppose we should have a look,” the eldest finally suggested.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Jadis looked out from her sled. “Where is that Son of Adam?”</p><p class="double">There was a ping next to her.</p><p class="double">“Yoink, yoink, yoink,” a voice said, accompanied by three pops, and then a final loud pop sounded just as she turned with wand raised.</p><p class="double">Something seemed wrong.</p><p class="double">“...where did my reindeer and drover go?”</p><p class="double">Gathering her power, Jadis prepared for battle. The response was near-instinct after a hundred years of ruling Narnia – for she was but one woman, be she ever so powerful, and Narnia did not take to the yoke well.</p><p class="double">It was time for another sweep with the wolves, if some resistance movement or other had begun again...</p><p class="double">At that point, a rock the size of a large house and travelling at two thousand metres per second arrived, which rather put an end to the plans Jadis was making in an emphatically final way.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>And that should take care of that,</i> Twilight thought to herself.</p><p class="double">Admittedly, she wasn&#039;t sure on whether Jadis was capable of coming back – the fourth book suggested that she never really entirely died even when eaten by a lion – but this should be good enough.</p><p class="double">One thing Twilight was not willing to allow was for that woman to be capable of her usual magic. She didn&#039;t know, nor want to know, how the Deplorable Word worked, but since the last time Jadis had killed that spell everyone else in the same reality had died...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, anyway, she&#039;s not coming back,” Twilight explained to a number of large, well-armed monsters.</p><p class="double">“You have killed the White Witch?” a dwarf asked.</p><p class="double">“Not entirely sure,” Twilight admitted. “But no matter how powerful the witch, a meteorite between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp her style.”</p><p class="double">She paused. “Basically, at this point I think there&#039;s supposed to be a big battle, but I think we may as well just skip straight to the peace treaty. I&#039;m going to go ahead and offer equal citizenship with a four year delay. Two years if one of the animals or other creatures not involved with Jadis vouches for you.”</p><p class="double">They mulled that over.</p><p class="double">While they did, Twilight fired off another spell. “Mass stone to flesh!”</p><p class="double">She consulted a mental check list. Sort out the winter, check... White Witch, check... her army, check... stoned statues, check...</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Anyway,” Twilight said, standing on a dais in Cair Paravel a week later as the songbird orchestra died away. “I have no particular desire to make myself ruler over you all without consultation, and it is also known that prophecy says Narnia does well with human rulers...”</p><p class="double">She winked. “But I have certain issues with prophecy. So, I will introduce to you an idea with which these human children are well familiar. It is called a constitutional monarchy.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh great Tisroc (may your name be blesséd), we have the Narnian reply to your entirely reasonable suggestion that their barbarian nation submit to your blessed rule and become part of Calormene,&quot; a functionary droned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, let&#039;s have it, you unworthy worm!&quot;</p><p class="double">The heavily bejewelled potentate read the scroll out loud.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;From the United Kingdoms of Narnia, Archenland, Terebithia, and the Lone Islands to the Tisroc, Ruler of all Calormene.</p><p class="double">Go outside on your balcony and look up...&#039; What foolishness is this?&quot;</p><p class="double">The light from outside dimmed slightly and he looked out, and up at the sky. The reason for the darkness was obvious enough, a solar eclipse was hardly inconspicuous. White faced, he read the rest of the scroll.</p><p class="double">&#039;That&#039;s our answer. Any questions?</p><p class="double">High King Peter, King Edmund, Minister of Justice, Queen Susan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Queen Lucy, Minster of Health</p><p class="double">PP Secretary Twilight Sparkle, Royal Archivist and part time magical super-weapon.&#039; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Goodness,” Susan said, as the four Pevensies picked themselves up from the beach. “So, we are back in Narnia.”</p><p class="double">“It hasn&#039;t changed a bit,” Lucy sighed, looking up at the castle of Cair Paravel towering over them.</p><p class="double">“Are you sure?” Edmund asked, in a strange voice.</p><p class="double">The others turned to see where he was looking.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Peter said in a small voice, as two airships dumped ballast and set out east for the Lonely Islands.</p><p class="double">“Hello!” Twilight said, cantering over from the beach stairs. “Sorry, I should have been here sooner. And sorry for the culture shock, as well – I&#039;m afraid we rather kept inventing things without you. There&#039;s good news, though – you&#039;re not the only humans here any more. Come along, the Parliament will want to meet you!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Well, that was... exhausting,” Peter said, flopping down on the grass of the tourney field.</p><p class="double">“Who was that you were fighting?” Edmund asked.</p><p class="double">“Caspian, of course.” Peter rolled his eyes. “This new royal family is like the French Kings from our world – they always have the same name.”</p><p class="double">“I like him,” Susan said, looking across the field. “Much nicer than that Rabadash fellow from last time. Oh – where is the archery tournament?”</p><p class="double">“The next field over, I think,” Edmund replied promptly. “Lu already went over there.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">A boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb – and please do not laugh, though he is used to it – hurried towards a cave as rain began to fall.</p><p class="double">With a loud pop, Twilight appeared in the valley. “Oh, hello! Sorry, we haven&#039;t met. My name&#039;s Twilight... sorry I couldn&#039;t meet you sooner, I&#039;m afraid there was a terrible argument going on with some giants.”</p><p class="double">Eustace stared at her.</p><p class="double">Twilight waved, blushing. “Yes, I know, it can be a bit overwhelming. Anyway. I should warn you that sleeping on a dragon&#039;s hoard – like the one in the cave – will turn you into a dragon. It can be undone, but... I just thought I&#039;d warn you. Later!”</p><p class="double">She vanished with another pop.</p><p class="double">Eustace sat down just inside the cave, and thought carefully.</p><p class="double">On the one hand, he was quite overwhelmed by this Narnia place. From the strange, creaking paddle wheels and sails of the Dawn Treader – and should those really go together? - to the casual acceptance amongst the crew of that ship that a phoenix sat under the boiler and three naiads controlled the sails, Narnia was very foreign to his picture of how the world should work.</p><p class="double">On the other hand, dragons were pretty cool.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">With a series of skittering splashes, a lot of dragon landed in the surf.</p><p class="double">“Hullo!” he said, sculling over to the frigate as it rode at anchor. “Flying is super!”</p><p class="double">“Is that Eustace?” Caspian asked, staring over the starboard paddle.</p><p class="double">“Yes.” The dragon waved. “It&#039;s a little strange, but I like lizards. Would anyone like a ride?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight ticked two more boxes on her checklist.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Oh, so that&#039;s how it works!” Twilight said, slamming a book shut. “Oog. Well, at least that explains a few things...”</p><p class="double">She lit her horn, and got casting.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">An extremely irritated-looking mouse glared balefully up at Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Oh, don&#039;t give me that,” Twilight admonished. “I did revive you... eventually... and given what you were going to do I think I was rather nicer than you deserve.”</p><p class="double">The mouse flipped a claw at her.</p><p class="double">“None of that.” Twilight spun the cage and gave its occupant a look. “Or can you honestly tell me you wouldn&#039;t cast the Deplorable Word the moment you had a functioning voicebox?”</p><p class="double">Jadis the otherwise-normal mouse (who was most definitely not a Mouse) squeaked something which was probably her best attempt at obscenity.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“See the lantern?” the lady of the green kirtle said, as thick, sweet smoke wove around the heads of the friends. “The sun is just what you think of when you think of a big lantern. There is only the lantern, there is no real sun.”</p><p class="double">Eustace nodded heavily. “That&#039;s logical. What about the flying unicorn?”</p><p class="double">The lady of the green kirtle frowned. “Er... a big pony?”</p><p class="double">“Little pony, thank you,” Twilight said, walking in the door and coughing. “Faugh, this is awful stuff.”</p><p class="double">She pointed a hoof at the lady, clearing the air with two powerful wingbeats. “You lot. People like you are why running this place is a full time job, I swear.”</p><p class="double">The lady hissed, and turned into a giant serpent.</p><p class="double">“Now that&#039;s mature.” Twilight&#039;s horn flared, and both serpent and alicorn vanished.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">With a colossal splash, fifty feet of serpent landed in the sea to the east of Dragon Island.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Twilight ported back into the Lady&#039;s chambers. “Okay, done. Anyone who doesn&#039;t want to get straight back to Narnia, please leave the room now.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">With a certain proprietary pride, Twilight watched the pillar of flame climb skywards from Cape Paravel.</p><p class="double">Certainly, Celestia might have taught her, and she might have had experience with Equestria, but this was her first time with responsibility for an entire country that she hadn&#039;t had the experience with being a subject of first.</p><p class="double">All things considered, a space program was a pretty good achievement for a first try.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.2 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy closed her eyes for a moment, flinching at the sounds coming in the window, then her expression firmed.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m not just cowardly Fluttershy. Not any more.</i></p><p class="double">She pushed off the covers and got out of bed.</p><p class="double">“Angel? Be a dear and ask the ponies trying to destroy the town with pure music to turn it down a bit?”</p><p class="double">Several lapine stomps tracked across the floor, followed by a bang which shook the house.</p><p class="double">The pegasus smiled gently. Angel was such a grumpy bunny sometimes.</p><p class="double">“Okay, who&#039;s hungry?”</p><p class="double"><i>“Not me, thanks,” </i>the pelican said.</p><p class="double">Several hummingbirds started piping for nectar, speaking over one another in their high voices.</p><p class="double">“All right, I&#039;ll get to you in a minute,” Fluttershy said, rapping the ground with her hoof and causing a vine to burst forth. Moving at walking pace, it spread over the eaves of her house before budding and flowering in a pulse of honeysuckle scent.</p><p class="double">Most of the animals stared at her. (The hummingbirds, more pragmatic or just hungrier, got stuck in.)</p><p class="double">She waved back with a broad smile, and began boosting her herb garden.</p><p class="double">Druids were really good at gardening.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Whistling an old song Spike had taught her once about a harper and her dragonets, Fluttershy packed together some lunches for whenever they were needed in the coming loop.</p><p class="double">As she rolled up a pancake with slices of cucumber and lilypad, there was a knock at the door.</p><p class="double">“Coming,” she said quietly, putting the food down and trotting over.</p><p class="double">Upon opening the door, she saw a bright yellow earth pony colt flanked by two adorably fuzzy wolf cubs.</p><p class="double">She blinked. “Is that...”</p><p class="double">“Little mother!” The colt crouched down and launched himself at her, throwing his forelegs about her neck. The two wolves joined him, and all four went over in a tangle of limbs.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled. “Lemon, it&#039;s good to see you.”</p><p class="double">“And you, little mother.” Lemon Rush – normally Leman Russ, primarch of the Space Wolves – clambered off her, and looked around her house. “It&#039;s been too long since I&#039;ve been here.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus rolled over and pushed herself upright, then nuzzled him. “I haven&#039;t seen you in too long either, Lemon. How are you?”</p><p class="double">Rush sighed. “Well, we&#039;ve picked up a lot more loopers recently. Father, or the Emperor, or whatever his real name is, started looping a few thousand ago... and all that&#039;s done is make it weirder.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy made some tea. Black for Rush; herbal for her; and Freki and Geri got gravy. (She&#039;d designed it herself. The wolves certainly seemed to give it their approval.)</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Rush said with a grateful smile, taking a sip. “Nobody does it like you do. Anyway, at least one of my brothers started looping soon afterwards – do you remember Vulkan?” Fluttershy nodded, and he went on. “That was a huge help. And I needed it...”</p><p class="double">After a long sigh, and some more tea, he looked up.</p><p class="double">“The four Chaos Gods started looping.”</p><p class="double">The gentle pegasus winced.</p><p class="double">“I know! Sure, they&#039;re not nearly as bad, now... I think they&#039;re suffering the reverse version of... what did your friend call it, Sakura syndrome?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. “Reverse version? So they&#039;re just... bored of all the chaos?”</p><p class="double">A shrug. “Basically. Or at least mass-death chaos. The galaxy&#039;s a safer place, now, but it&#039;s also a lot harder to keep track of – and when you consider normal for us, that&#039;s saying a lot...”</p><p class="double">Freki padded over to Fluttershy and gave her a pleading look.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” she said, and mixed up another two cups.</p><p class="double">Once that was done, she smiled. “I have something... nice, to show you.”</p><p class="double">She blurred, and once that was done an adult wolf stood where she had.</p><p class="double">Rush looked the wolf up and down, slowly and carefully. “Little mother?”</p><p class="double">The wolf nodded.</p><p class="double">“...that&#039;s so cool! Come on, boys, playtime!”</p><p class="double">Freki, Geri and Rush all pounced.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy skipped back, letting the wolves miss, then caught Rush&#039;s mane gently between her teeth and plopped him on the ground again.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not winning that easily!” Rush laughed, spinning to face her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Angel Bunny tromped home.</p><p class="double">On hearing the barks and laughter coming from inside his nominal owner&#039;s cottage, he decided she didn&#039;t really need to learn about his failure just yet.</p><p class="double">(It was surprisingly hard to make ponies turn their music down when the music made the ground act like a springy trampoline.)</p><p class="double">Maybe the manticore would be up for a thumb-wrestle...</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.1 continued</p><p class="double">“Are you sure you&#039;ll be okay with this, Gilda?” Twilight asked quietly. “I&#039;m sure none of us would blame you if you took a raincheck for the next few loops and worked with Dash to build something useful.”</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged, full of bravado – which both knew at least partly feigned. “I got this.”</p><p class="double">“Sure?” Twilight double-checked.</p><p class="double">“Sure.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, then.” Twilight nodded. “But, you know, introduce yourself to Dash first, we&#039;ve got a good few hours before the Summer Sun celebrations start.”</p><p class="double">“Good idea.” Gilda looked up, eyes flicking across the sky, then took wing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“Hey, slowpoke!”</p><p class="double">Dash jerked awake. “Wha-”</p><p class="double">A familiar griffin flew into sight. “Hi, Dash. Bet you didn&#039;t expect to see me around here!”</p><p class="double">“Gilda!” Dash&#039;s face lit up. “Celestia&#039;s muzzle, I haven&#039;t seen you in... must be <i>years</i>. How are you doing?”</p><p class="double">“Eh, you know me.” Gilda flared her wings, and landed on Dash&#039;s cloud. “Snorting fire at every pony who pisses me off, mostly. What about you?”</p><p class="double">Dash grinned. “I&#039;m in charge of the weather around here.”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Gilda looked around, contemplatively. “That explains all the clouds.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, I could clear those in ten seconds flat!” Dash protested. “It&#039;s totally a legit use of time to rest up. Fliers need their rest!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure.” Gilda flicked her tail. “Hey, watch this. Some pony taught it to me a while back.”</p><p class="double">She flicked her tail again, and a cloud fell in half.</p><p class="double">“Cool, huh?”</p><p class="double">“What the...” Dash blinked, and focused. No matter whether she was looping or not, the blue pegasus was an expert at practical applications of weather magic. “Was that... some kind of air blade?”</p><p class="double">“Basically,” Gilda agreed easily. “Anyway, enough about me. So, who else is awesome around here?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“...the night will last forever!”</p><p class="double">Gilda raised a clawed foot. “Point of order.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Nightmare Moon turned to face her.</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Well, I&#039;m basically wondering... if it&#039;s eternal night here, what does that mean for the griffins?”</p><p class="double">“...I do not follow, subject,” the dark alicorn said.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m a free citizen of the Gryphon Lands, thank-you-very-much,” Gilda corrected. “Anyway, the griffins are, what, well into the twilight zone. So, if you&#039;re going to just have a bit of libration going on, then we&#039;ll be perfectly happy with that. Just a suggestion.”</p><p class="double">“What is libration?” Nightmare Moon asked, puzzled.</p><p class="double">Gilda waved her feet in the air. “Basically, it&#039;s when a world sort of... wobbles, I think? Kind of like a drunk bloke heading back to his house. He always faces towards it, but sometimes he&#039;s looking nearly straight at it and sometimes he&#039;s nearly staring into a shop only two doors down from where he&#039;s walking. So, for us, it&#039;d mean the sun goes up, and then goes down again on the same side. Nice and regular.”</p><p class="double">“...I may choose to ignore that,” the Nightmare said, with a flip of her wings. “What concern are the Gryphon Lands to me?”</p><p class="double">“We-ll,” Gilda said, cricking her neck and taking a deep breath, “I couldn&#039;t possibly comment.”</p><p class="double">Her tail lashed for a moment, then described a lazy arc behind her.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon winced, and the moon wobbled a bit. “What did you just do?”</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged, her tail swirling again. “Nothing.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn looked closer, still frowning as she held her moon steady. “Why has your coat gone white?”</p><p class="double">Then her eyes flashed with dark lightning. “Lap-cat of Celestia!”</p><p class="double">Gilda grinned. “Oh, hey, a challenge. Official and everything.”</p><p class="double">As a magical glow built on Nightmare Moon&#039;s horn, Gilda whipped her tail across in a flat arc. Something seemed to linger behind the path it took-</p><p class="double">-and, with the sound of clashing metal, Nightmare Moon&#039;s horn glow vanished.</p><p class="double">“What?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s called a power slash,” the griffin informed her opponent. “Hey, watch!”</p><p class="double">The little tuft of fur at the end of her tail flickered in four distinct arcs, and the stage fell in under Nightmare Moon in a neat square.</p><p class="double">Startled, the returned goddess fell into the basement in a cascade of splinters.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Gilda shouted into the hole, conscious of the awed gazes of about half of Ponyville. “Do you surrender yet?”</p><p class="double">She danced back from the hole with wings flaring. “Whoa, guess not!”</p><p class="double">With a crash, Nightmare Moon emerged from beneath the floor, horn blazing. “Insolent, insignificant little <i>sparrow!</i>”</p><p class="double">Then all her feathers came off in a cloud of cut pinions.</p><p class="double">Gilda winced at the <i>thud</i>.</p><p class="double">“What about now?”</p><p class="double">A cloud of dark, starry smoke boiled up through the hole.</p><p class="double">One final tail-movement. This time, a five hundred and forty degree spiral arc. As she finished it, Gilda reared up and beat her wings once.</p><p class="double">Sudden, gale-force winds blew down the back wall and carried the cloud with them into a nearby house.</p><p class="double">The cloud hit with an incongruous <i>thud.</i></p><p class="double">As the bamboozled Empress of Darkness coalesced, Gilda strode over and grabbed her helm. “Yoink.”</p><p class="double">Turning to the stunned ponies, she put it carefully on her head. “Hey, this makes me the ruler of the night, now, right? ...wait, hang on, or is that a thing only griffins do?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Laughing and joking, Gilda walked slowly back to Twilight&#039;s house in the gathering dawn, with a dozen or so ponies asking questions of her almost non-stop.</p><p class="double">“Hey, it&#039;s Gryphonic law, I thought she was challenging me to a duel! Well, she kinda was – just, less duel more splat. Or so she thought...” a wink.</p><p class="double">This time, Rarity asked a question.</p><p class="double">“The coat? Heh, bit of a trick I picked up. It&#039;s just when I do the painting thing with my tail, though, not sure all the details. It looks cool, though. Come on, guys, I need my beauty sleep.”</p><p class="double">Reluctantly, the crowd drew back, and Twilight let Gilda in through the door.</p><p class="double">The griffin didn&#039;t look back until the door was closed.</p><p class="double">“Are the curtains shut?” she asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Gilda flopped onto a couch.</p><p class="double">“...bucking <i>haybale</i>, I must be crazy...” she said, in a distant tone. “I just fought an honour duel with an alicorn princess...”</p><p class="double">Sweat was running down her face, and her forelegs were trembling as reaction set in.</p><p class="double">“I did just do that, right?” she checked. “It wasn&#039;t just some crazy dream?”</p><p class="double">“No, it was pre-tty cool,” Twilight confirmed. “I didn&#039;t realize you got the Brush powers working, that was great!”</p><p class="double">“Cool. Hey, can I get a flannel?”</p><p class="double">Twilight pulled one down from her bathroom and wetted it. “Here.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.” Gilda rubbed her eyes, then her beak. “Ah, I needed that.”</p><p class="double">There was a silence.</p><p class="double">“...you know, it wasn&#039;t all bravado,” the griffin said in a quiet voice.</p><p class="double">“Oh?”</p><p class="double">“All that posturing. Pretending I didn&#039;t have a care in the world.” Gilda shrugged. “Partly it was – Dash and I are like that – but not all of it. I was...” Gilda&#039;s voice husked for a moment. “Terrified. I had a plan, but...”</p><p class="double">She rubbed the flannel over her face again.</p><p class="double">“Right. Basically, I had to keep her off balance. I&#039;m not bad, I like to think, but I couldn&#039;t beat an alicorn princess in an actual fight.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded along.</p><p class="double">“So, I relied on the brush stuff being too... different, really, for her to understand.”</p><p class="double">“I know what you mean,” Twilight assured her. “I&#039;ve used it a lot. The trick is to not let the enemy refocus – make sure they&#039;re trying to work out what your terms even are, not let them realize they could ignore them.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” Gilda took a deep breath. “Phew. Okay, I&#039;m hungry. Any ideas?”</p><p class="double">“I think I can do an omlette,” Twilight said, already flipping through files on a PADD. “I learned because it&#039;s just polite to give human visitors... well, recognizable food...”</p><p class="double">She paused. “Oh, just so you know, we generally consider it impolite to seriously damage town property unless necessary. But, then, we actually wreck the place once every six <i>months</i> on average, so no harm done. Just something to remember.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Gilda nodded. “I can try – well, that or work on Rejuvenation. Anything else?”</p><p class="double">“Learn a defensive technique. Seriously, you&#039;re going to <i>need</i> one if you keep going up against alicorns...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.4</p><p class="double">“So, how is this... gonna work?” Applebloom asked, prodding her new necklace.</p><p class="double"><i>Hay if I know.</i> Cookie sent a mental version of a shrug. <i>Last we remember was basically dying of old age, and then here we were. Don&#039;t ask us...</i></p><p class="double">“Right.” Applebloom looked up at Twilight. “Are they gonna start Looping?”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. “I doubt it – not on their own, anyway. I mean, they don&#039;t have anypony to be in a normal loop...”</p><p class="double"><i>Loops?</i> Cookie&#039;s mental tone sharpened with interest. <i>What are &#039;loops&#039;?</i></p><p class="double">Earth pony filly and sometimes-alicorn librarian mare exchanged a look.</p><p class="double">“&#039;Bloom, can you go get your friends and their, er... new... friends? I think it&#039;d be easier to explain all this just once.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">“...so, anyway,” Twilight finished, clicking her slide projector past the end of the carousel, “that&#039;s the jist of it.”</p><p class="double">The Crusaders snored.</p><p class="double">“It wasn&#039;t <i>that</i> boring,” she said, sounding slightly hurt.</p><p class="double"><i>No, it wasn&#039;t,</i> Cover broadcast. <i>But I think they&#039;ve heard it all before...</i></p><p class="double"><i>What does this mean for us?</i> Pansy asked, getting right to the heart of the matter.</p><p class="double">“I honestly don&#039;t know.” Twilight frowned. “My daughter&#039;s about the only being I know of who loops despite not having existed during the core loop – for her it&#039;s kind of a loophole, because she&#039;s an actualized alter ego... anyway. From what I know of the matter, you might just... stop existing once the Loop ends.”</p><p class="double">The three disembodied founders conversed amongst themselves for quite some time.</p><p class="double"><i>You are sure that a looper must inhabit their own body?</i> Cookie said, carefully.</p><p class="double">“Well... we&#039;ve never known it to happen otherwise, except in particularly strange fused loops...” Twilight rubbed her chin. “Sometimes we turn up as other kinds of body, or even in one another&#039;s bodies, but then we&#039;re established as loopers...”</p><p class="double"><i>And no non-looper may </i>share the body of a looper? continued the earth pony, methodically working down a mental list.</p><p class="double">“Aha!” Twilight&#039;s eyes lit. “I may have something!” She cleared her throat, and held out her hoof. “OWL?”</p><p class="double">A bracelet appeared around her lower leg.</p><p class="double">Stand by, ready.</p><p class="double">“This is Owl, I picked him up in a Nanoha Loop. He&#039;s an Intelligent Device, technically bonded to what may be my soul – I&#039;ve lost the bracelet to a Loop two or three times, before, and it&#039;s always been the same Owl once I reconstructed another one.”</p><p class="double"><i>Ah. Yes, that does have potential.</i></p><p class="double">Cookie paused, and Clover took up the slack. <i>How does one bind an Intelligent Device?</i></p><p class="double">“I can do it fairly easy, providing both halves of the bond are willing and I have the devices...” Twilight said, thinking. “I did it for Trixie and her Device, Loki, and that seems to have stuck. Yes, I should be able to.”</p><p class="double"><i>Good,</i> Pansy commented. <i>Now, er... how long until they wake up?</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and after we managed to find away around the spider eggs, we stuck the key in the chest... and it turned out to be the wrong key! Daring basically just threw up her hooves and dragged the entire chest out of the ruins all the way to Fillydelphia.&quot; Trixie grinned, leaning forward. &quot;Guess what was inside.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis tapped her chin. &quot;I&#039;m thinking.... another riddle map?</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep! Another riddle map!&quot; The unicorn laughed as she leaned back in her chair. &quot;All that for another bucking riddle map, but that&#039;s not the best part. The temple that riddle map led to had been excavated and thoroughly plundered DECADES ago!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh <i>no,</i>&quot; Chrysalis gasped dramatically, her eyes wide as she brought her hooves to her mouth. &quot;Dealing with bureaucracy?! That had to be terrible for her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, yeah. She was lucky I was around.&quot; Trixie sighed. &quot;That was... a completely crazy loop. And that was before Discord got involved.&quot; She let her eyes drift across the plates of hay fries to the black pegasus sitting across from her. &quot;What about you? What&#039;s your craziest Loop story?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rubbed the back of her head. &quot;Well... I&#039;m still fairly new as a looper, and most of my loops tend to start baseline. I mean, I don&#039;t invade Canterlot, I usually go straight to Celestia and negotiate an integration, but aside from minor differences in how ponies view changelings it&#039;s all mostly routine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on, you&#039;ve got to have something!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...there was this one loop where Celestia was the only pony. Everyone else was secretly a changeling.&quot; The black pegasus rolled her eyes. &quot;I know it sounds a lot less dramatic then your Daring Do loop, but with all the hives and the subterfuge it was just... wild. Even after I made peace with Celestia....&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Honestly, Twilight had to keep a chart on her at all times to keep track.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle was actually confused?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow, that... wow.&quot; Trixie shook her head. &quot;That had to have been stressful. Still, all changelings, huh? Shape Twist must have been popular!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blushed a bit. &quot;You... know about that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My special talent is stage magic. Illusions aren&#039;t <i>quite</i> the same as shapeshifting, but...&quot; Trixie shrugs. &quot;I think I&#039;d be fairly good at it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not, actually. I can do ears and tail, but... Biology is hard.&quot; Chrysalis shrugged. &quot;Well, nonmagical biology. The more magical a creature is, the easier it is for me to pulse into it. Unless it&#039;s unstable magic. It&#039;s really all rather complex.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie tapped her chin thoughtfully. &quot;Well... what if you pumped the aura of an ordinary animal with magic? That would make it easier to read, at least...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...That could work,&quot; Chrysalis mused. &quot;I mean... I don&#039;t know what would happen, but... yeah, that&#039;s an idea. I&#039;ll run it by Fluttershy when we have our next practice session.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy the werewolf... Werepone? Ponewolf? I mean, it kind of makes sense, but it&#039;s so unexpected.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apparently it&#039;s a fused loop thing.... I still haven&#039;t had one of those. Mostly just variant loops.”</p><p class="double">Trixie chuckled and shook her head. &quot;Trust me, it can get weird. Twilight&#039;s mentioned this one loop where she was a pet and a secret agent at the same time-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem.&quot; The waiter walked up. &quot;I am afraid, madams, that the restaurant is closing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie glanced at the clock. &quot;Wow, is it that late already? Huh. Well, um... this was fun, actually. I wouldn&#039;t mind doing it again... same time next week?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis smiled. &quot;Sure. Why not.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.6 (Nikas)</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked from the talking ferret to the jewel turned staff he gave her, to the surprised looking Cutie Mark Crusaders.</p><p class="double">The first was only... <i>mildly</i> strange; he did come out of the Everfree, after all. The second was a bit more head turning, but only because of a magical artifact responding to an Earth Pony. The third was jaw dropping, because the surprise was not &quot;What the Buck is That?&quot; The looks of the CMC were more along the lines of &quot;Why the Buck is that Here?&quot;</p><p class="double">She sighed. &quot;You girls know what this is.&quot; It was in no way a question. &quot;Something from another Loop I wasn&#039;t in?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom shook her head. &quot;Not us personally. Miss Twilight was in some loops like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Both fillies ignored Scootaloo&#039;s muttered &quot;Be easier to count places she hasn&#039;t been.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her fellow Earth Pony nodded. &quot;Anyway, she made us something along those lines, well the reasons are involved and we have a rampaging magical artifact to capture and seal first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara nodded as the Crusaders produced magical devices – and why the hay did they name them for the Founders, anyway? Was it the three-friends-three-tribes thing? &quot;Right, any pointers?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle piped up. &quot;Well, Equestrian Magic runs on Friendship. Mid Childa Magic runs on <span style="color:pink;">Befriending</span>. At least you have the right coat colour for it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara shook her head wondering why she could hear the capitalization and color of that word. &quot;Right, more stuff to explain later. HEY UGLY, STEP AWAY FROM THE SWEET SHOP!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked in, giving Macintosh a weary look. &quot;Thanks for setting up the bar early this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a problem.&quot; The stallion slid her a mug. &quot;Let me guess: something about yer last loop got under yer skin?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Twilight had never been one to quaff back cider; even now, it was just a small gulp. &quot;Strange thing is, I didn&#039;t pick up on it. Thought it was a normal lonely loop. I went the route of, well, basically being Pinkie Pie the Nerd. It&#039;s a lonely loop thing.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Nothing seemed off at all, and then the wedding rolled around.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed. &quot;Did Cadance turn out ta have been a changeling all along again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no. No, Cadance was still in the caves.&quot; Twilight laughed wryly. &quot;Thing is, she got replaced before Shining even started dating her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; The unicorn took a sip of her cider. &quot;Poor ol&#039; Cadance, trapped in there almost a year, while Chrysalis fell in love with my brother. Neither of them were awake, so that&#039;s something, but when I brought her to the wedding she was completely shocked. Apparently she only thought of Shining as a brother.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... Shining can&#039;t have taken that well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh it gets better.&quot; Twilight finished off her cider. &quot;Cadance took the opportunity to propose to her real true love... who, it turns out, was me! I mean, that came completely out of nowhere! And, somehow, she&#039;d gotten it in her head that alicorns were above good and evil. Actually, all of Canterlot thought that alicorns could do whatever they wanted, and Chrysalis managed to get them to forgive her for invading – forgive her for INVADING! Just because she claimed to be a cursed alicorn.&quot; The unicorn shook her head with a sigh. &quot;I mean that&#039;s true in some loops, but not that one...&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh chuckled to himself as he refilled the mug. &quot;Begging yer pardon, Twi, but most o&#039; Canterlot lack brains in certain ways.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha. You have no idea.... apparently, Celestia had spent so much on the wedding that the nobles insisted SOMEBODY get married. Me and Shining kept trying to pass the buck to each other for a day or two before I just went alicorn myself and got you and Cheerilee on the pulpit.&quot; She paused. &quot;Um, no offence...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not awake, not me.&quot; The stallion nodded amicably. &quot;Ah&#039;m assumin&#039; ya checked first. Did things cool down after that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh I wish.&quot; Twilight sipped her cider. &quot;Chrysalis and Cadance kept trying to seduce Shining and me... they started giving each other tips...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.6 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... Apple Bloom?

She&#039;s a computer, not...&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom stared at her for a while. Suddenly she sighed. &quot;Riiiiight, ya&#039;ll weren&#039;t Awake fer that first Nightmare Night loop. Um, how do Ah put this... this <i>is</i> Smart Cookie. The founder.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See, Cubic Zirconia there, she was made as an Intelligent Device, but...&quot; The farmer filly rubbed the back of her head. &quot;Well... see, there was this one loop where we decided ta dress up as the Founders fer Nightmare Night... but, um, because of magic we actually became the founders. And then, because of magic, the founders kind of stayed around after the costume thing was finished, only they were necklaces... We weren&#039;t sure if they&#039;d start looping...&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara shook her head in disbelief. &quot;That has got to be the third weirdest loop I&#039;ve heard of. Okay, so you guys have... actual people there, fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom narrowed her eyes. &quot;It&#039;s probably wise ta treat <i>all</i> A.I.s as people, least when yer first meeting them. Ah mean, it&#039;s really fifty fifty, and being polite makes it less likely they&#039;ll try ta overthrow &#039;organic masters&#039; and really just go for equality.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, alright... Um... Zirconia, do you think of yourself as a person?&quot;</p><p class="double">The staff in Diamond Tiara&#039;s hooves beeped and flashed for a bit.</p><p class="double">&quot;That <i>so</i> doesn&#039;t clear things up at all.&quot; Smart Cookie and Cubic Zirconia flashed erratically for a few seconds. Diamond Tiara rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, yeah, laugh it up...&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, she turned to Apple Bloom. &quot;So, uh... what were you two talking about anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">To her surprise, the yellow filly glanced away quietly. &quot;Ah&#039;d really rather not say.&quot; Smart Cookie beeped. &quot;No, it&#039;s... it&#039;s personal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apple Bloom....&quot;</p><p class="double">An aggravated, resigned sigh escaped Apple Bloom&#039;s lips. &quot;We were talking bout her family, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Alright...?&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them sat there for a while.</p><p class="double">&quot;...It&#039;s not bad fer her,&quot; Apple Bloom explained eventually. &quot;She was literally pulled from her deathbed to the... to our time, before we made her a device, she had all her affairs in order. It&#039;s just...&quot; She sighed, shaking her head. &quot;How many loops have Ah gone like this? The Apple family, well, we pride ourselves on family. And here Ah am, stuck right at the cusp of puberty. Sometimes Ah&#039;m older.... sometimes Ah&#039;m a LOT older, like Ah&#039;m where Granny Smith would be, normally. And those loop memories give me husbands and children and Ah know, right when the loop resets, there Ah am again being a blank flanked filly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Maybe you&#039;ll have kids someday,&quot; Diamond Tiara offered. &quot;I mean, Nyx--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Loophole. She already existed, just... not like that. The loops consider Nyx and Nightmare Moon ta be the same pony...&quot; Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Best Ah can really hope for is living vicariously through Cookie&#039;s past.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh... that... that sucks.&quot; Diamond Tiara shook her head. &quot;Wow. I never even thought of that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s why we can&#039;t have kids in th&#039; loops,&quot; Apple Bloom explained. &quot;They might not loop and.... well, whoever&#039;s running this thing isn&#039;t that cruel.&quot; She stood. &quot;Anyway, Ah&#039;m feeling pissy. Wanna go find some monsters ta befriend?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey mom, Luna&#039;s not Awake this loop so I thought I&#039;d just drop by to...&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx trailed off as her eyes landed on the unicorn who was... sitting at the kitchen table, a steaming teacup in front of her, staring out the window.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Mom? You okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle took a breath... and slowly let it out. &quot;Hmmm. Well... I&#039;m just a little melancholy.&quot;</p><p class="double">The black alicorn trotted up to the table, sitting in the chair next to her. &quot;Want to talk about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...no.&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;But it&#039;ll probably help... last loop, I Awakened in my childhood. See, I wanted to see if I could get a different cutie mark, something other then magic as a special talent. I had to bribe Dash not to do a rainboom... Lived in Canterlot for a while. A long while...&quot;</p><p class="double">She sipped her tea.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing was working, so I figured; why not make a crusader group all my own? I had my two blank flank friends, we had an adventure....&quot; A small giggle escaped her lips. &quot;Turns out Friendship is Magic. I got the same mark I always get...&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx tilted her head. &quot;So... you&#039;re upset you got the same mark?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. I <i>was</i> upset, but Fleur and Flash... they didn&#039;t understand why. They just kept pestering and asking until finally... I... I told them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her daughter took in a sharp breath. &quot;Oh... oh, I... I&#039;m sorry-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, if you&#039;re awake the loop&#039;s end is really beautiful. Terrible, but beautiful.&quot; Twilight nodded to herself. &quot;They were so afraid... I invited them over for one last tea party. They&#039;d never told anyone else, of course. I... I lied to them, told them they were loopers, that they might be Awake next time....&quot; She sighed. &quot;This morning I arranged to &#039;meet&#039; Fancypants, over a little matter at Celestia&#039;s school. Fleur.... she didn&#039;t recognize me. I don&#039;t know where Flash Sentry is now, but... he promised to send me a letter if...&quot;</p><p class="double">Without even a second thought, Nyx nuzzled her mother. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">35.9 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;The night shall last forever!&quot; the statement was followed by maniacal laughter on the stage. It was another weird loop, Twilight thought. Instead of Nightmare Moon, it was Tirek that came back from being banished by the two pony princesses.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, is it my turn to handle this?&quot; Fluttershy asked.</p><p class="double">Her purple unicorn friend nodded, &quot;Sure, it&#039;s all yours. Have fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus nodded from under her mane, &quot;Alright. I&#039;ve got to go, um, train.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she flew off, Twilight thought she had detected a hint of a mischievous smile on the reserved animal caretaker, druid, and fellow looper.</p><p class="double">Instead of doing anything herself, she just stood off to the side with the remaining elements of harmony as the evil centaur gloated and monologued about his plans.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, two green vines burst from one of the walls. They sped along the stage, passing Tirek on either side, before leaving through the far wall.</p><p class="double">&quot;What manner of trickery is this?&quot; the villain looked down carefully at the new plants.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the vines, &quot;Those almost look like..&quot;</p><p class="double">That was when a smiling locomotive-riding Fluttershy crashed through the wall at full speed and hit Tirek with the Ponyville Express.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tracks,&quot; Twilight finished in a deadpan.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie looked up with a smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;I get it now! She had to go &#039;Train&#039;!&quot; the pink pony started giggling until she fell down on the floor from laughter.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy landed next to a twitching hoof sticking out of a pile of rubble.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now no more talk about bringing eternal night or ruling the world, mister!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is only a minor setback! I will... what is that?&quot; the voice from inside the rubble pile sounded confused, &quot;Wait, no wait! They&#039;re everywhere!&quot;</p><p class="double">Vines had started to enter into the small cracks in the pile of debris. A lot of vines.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now what was that about giving up on your evil plans?&quot; Fluttershy asked patiently.</p><p class="double">Tirek growled with signs of struggle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t make me send in the squirrels,&quot; the yellow pegasus said, adding, &quot;and I know a lot of squirrels.&quot;</p><p class="double">The struggling stopped, &quot;... I&#039;ll behave.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s better,&quot; Fluttershy smiled.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, why a train, of all things?&quot; asked Rarity.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy just gave a shy smile. &quot;I like trains.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">35.10</p><p class="double">Twilight knocked on her assistant&#039;s door.</p><p class="double">“Come in,” Spike called, and she pushed it open.</p><p class="double">Inside was... well, a mess. Notes, sketches, designs and even a few mathematical formulae covered the desk, the bed, three walls, and... yes, there were a few clipped to the ceiling as well.</p><p class="double">“You look busy,” Twilight said lightly.</p><p class="double">“I <i>am</i>,” Spike replied. “Hey, is Cadance awake this Loop?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Twilight shook her head. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Wedding planning.” Spike moved a few sketches and sat down.</p><p class="double">“Ouch.” Twilight winced.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Spike shrugged helplessly. “I want it to be the best I can make it... she deserves it. But... well, we&#039;ve seen things which would make the most jaded pony just stand and stare. How can I measure up to that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought for a good long while.</p><p class="double">“I admit, I&#039;m not all that good at this,” she said, slowly, “but it seems to me you have two options.”</p><p class="double">“Two&#039;s better than none,” Spike said, clapping his hands. “Let&#039;s hear them.”</p><p class="double">“Okay. Option one is that you two go and have a private wedding.” Twilight smiled gently. “I may not be good at this kind of thing, but I&#039;ve seen the two of you together – she wouldn&#039;t <i>care</i> if you got married in an epic cathedron or a... a hedge, really.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded.</p><p class="double">“The other option is to ask for help. From <i>all </i>of us, not just Cadence and I. If you&#039;re planning to wait until we&#039;re all here at the same time, then do – I&#039;ll let the others know you&#039;re after help when I see them.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Spike nodded again, and frowned. “I... don&#039;t know,” he confessed. “Part of me wants to show the world how lovely Rarity is... I&#039;m just not sure, Twi. Sorry.”</p><p class="double">Twilight bowed her head. “You don&#039;t need to make a decision now. Think it over.”</p><p class="double">“I will,” he promised.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Spike, there&#039;s no reason you can&#039;t do both.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought of that but... I don&#039;t know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It might be for the best, you both get a private intimate exchange of vows – you could be by yourselves or perhaps a few select witnesses. Then you can have a big event that will be the envy of the Looper&#039;s everywhere. Remember we functionally have eternity, myself more so. Anything Rarity and you want for this tell me and I&#039;ll get it.” Twilight grinned at him. “That&#039;s my wedding present to you.”</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s really tempting, but the big – the main reason I don&#039;t know if a big event is a good idea is that I... I don&#039;t want our first years together spoiled by ponies or... or, hay, <i>anyone,</i> complaining that Rarity&#039;s marrying a child. The &#039;Big Circles&#039; in Canterlot all <i>know</i> I&#039;m well under age and by the time I&#039;d be old enough our loop is usually over...&quot; Spike kicked the chair, sounding surprisingly bitter. &quot;I know it&#039;ll happen eventually, but I don&#039;t want it to happen – I want it to <i>not</i> happen for as long as possible, and definitely not at or just after our wedding.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;That, at least, isn&#039;t a problem that&#039;s going to be hard to solve.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not?&quot; Spike asked hopefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh No!&quot; Twilight cried out theatrically, &quot;Twilight&#039;s lost control of an experimental spell and The Elements, Spike and a bunch of others have been sucked into a magical portal! What ever shall we do! The portal has disappeared! Oh wait another portal is appearing! The horror! The HORROR! Yay! They&#039;re all back! Wait do they look older to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">She grinned, &quot;We say we travelled to a bunch of different worlds over fifteen to twenty years or so before managing to come back and that gives us an excuse to use <i>anything</i> you and Rarity want without raising more eyebrows. What do you say?&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>36.1 (Richardson)</p><p class="double"></p><p>The sea babbled at the hull of the boat. It should have been a good sound, a welcome sound. So why did her head hurt so much? Her loop memories trickled in, tip-toeing around her semi-conscious mind.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oi, luv, my rum.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her eyes snapped awake. Bad mistake, hangover plus mid-day sun reflecting off of the sea did not a charitable equation make. &quot;Ooooh. My head.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s what you get for drinking all of my rum. Here, take a bucket.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To-URK- ugh, that in?&quot; Twilight took the bucket, hiding it under her chin as her feet grew oddly wet.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, to bail out the boat it, though I have found it to be most delightfully useful for the first. We&#039;re sinking, and I would rather that we make our entrance to Port Royal in dryness and style. One must have a proper sense of showmanship in this line of work.&quot; The mysterious figure talked to much. Twilight tried to brain of who he was, but her think was broken and she had a case of the dumbs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you again? Everything is all-JACK!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain, Captain Jack Sparrow. Good to see you&#039;re finally awake-awake. Ever since we met, this confoundable loop has kept on- what did your friend call it? Ah, yes, it kept on shipping me with you. My Rum please.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The wha-? I was drinking this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quite fond of it.&quot; Jack took the bottle from her, distractedly pitching it overboard to her confusion. &quot;You drank it all, love. Rum&#039;s gone. Now start bailing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bailing, why-&quot;Twilight stopped talking as a jet of water started hitting her in the face. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">36.2 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&#039;I have paws.&#039;</p><p class="double">After a couple thousand loops, such things usually wouldn&#039;t upset Twilight Sparkle, but then her loop memories hit, and she was a bit weirded out. They were telling her she was a dog named Sparkplug, owned by Luna, who now a wacky inventor. &#039;Was that trip to the moon for real? Is it really made of cheese?&#039; Granted there had been that one loop back then where Luna had deliberately turned the moon into cheese, but it had been rock before. Also, that one had tasted like Brie, while the one here tasted a bit like Wensleydale, but not quite. &#039;When did I get so obsessed with cheese?&#039; Must be a property of the loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>We were running low on cash, so Luna had decided to rent one of spare rooms out. It was late morning when someone applied. Luna went to answer the door, and I remained in my chair where I&#039;d been knitting.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, its about the room, then?</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you like to inspect?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m asking 20 a week, including breakfast.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot;</p><p class="double">Despite only hearing Luna talk, it seemed like there was conversation going. What was even the person she was talking to stepped into view. If I didn&#039;t know this was going to be a weird loop before, this certainly clinched it, as a penguin walked into view. I took a double-take, and the penguin stared at me for a few seconds before walking up to the second floor.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>I found myself a half hour later wallpapering our spare room. The penguin had took my room! &#039;Love and tolerance&#039; I told myself. Looking up at the drab ceiling, I could definitely see it needing paint. Instead of getting ladder, I got a brilliant idea. Luna had gifted me, well more like, Luna had gifted herself, with something called Techno Trousers. Basically, mobile, autonomous pants. The neat thing was, they could climb walls and ceilings. It wasn&#039;t long before I&#039;d slipped into them, climbed the walls and hung from the ceiling, painting it. <i>Michaelangelo, eat your heart out.</i></p><p class="double">The clicking and clacking from the pants eventually caused our penguin friend to investigate. It was a bit unnerving, as he just stared at the me and the pants, not saying a word. Granted, I couldn&#039;t talk in this loop myself, but this was a bit unnerving.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>What was even more unnerving, after settling into the newly painted and wallpapered room, was the loud music coming from what was previously my room. Seemed that penguin really liked &quot;Tie A Yellow Ribbon&quot;, and played it constantly on the radio. I looked at the clock, with 12:20AM staring back at me. Love and Tolerance aside, you don&#039;t interrupt a girl&#039;s beauty sleep. I used a bit of PK and flicked off the radio as subtly as I could, dislodging some of the internal mechanism, so it couldn&#039;t be turned on again. The music sputtered and died, leaving a bit of static behind, and then, blessed silence.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>After last night, and the events of the morning; the penguin, I had never gotten its name and he couldn&#039;t talk, had fetched Luna&#039;s slippers and newspaper. Normally, this was something I, or at least Sparkplug did in the past. Was the penguin simply being nice? I took a walk to clear my head.</p><p class="double">As I was walking by the post office, something caught my eye. A wanted poster for a chicken named &#039;Feathers McGraw&#039; and a sizeable bounty underneath it. Something seemed very familiar about the picture. I put my paw over the rooster comb to cover it, revealing that our boarder, the penguin, was actually Feathers McGraw, a notorious criminal. I rushed home.</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Thankfully, Feathers was out, though I didn&#039;t know when he&#039;d return. I entered his room, my room, I thought ruefully. Yes, I can be very petty in my thoughts. Looking through his belongings, I found two very suspicious things. A map of the City Museum, and the Diamond Exhibition highlighted and labelled, and a handgun, very highly restricted in the UK. I had all the evidence I needed.</p><p class="double">I waited for Feathers&#039; return.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>I hauled the trussed up penguin into the kitchen where Luna was.</p><p class="double">&quot;What have you done with our paying customer?&quot; I took out the penguins bag and removed from it blueprints of the city museum with the diamond exhibition clearly marked.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right suspicious.&quot; said Luna tapping her chin.</p><p class="double">I produced a gun from his bag, and Luna leapt back in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Those&#039;re illegal!&quot;</p><p class="double">Finally, as my clinching evidence, I produced the wanted poster with Feathers face on it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold on there a second! That&#039;s a chicken, not our penguin!&quot; I smacked my forehead. I searched around in Feathers&#039; belonging until I found a red rubber glove, and slapped it upon his head, turning our penguin into a chicken.</p><p class="double">Luna gasped! &quot;It was in disguise all this time.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Well, we nabbed a notorious criminal, our money problems were solved for the foreseeable future, and the diamond on display at the city museum remained safe. As for the Techno Trousers? Well... maybe Applebloom will like them. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">36.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight relaxed in the waters of the out-door hot-spring. She might not have tried this if she hadn’t already consumed a good portion of the jug of pina colada, but it seemed to be working out. The manager of the onsen was a Mr Urashima, a thirty-something male who moved with authority and the aid of a walking stick. She’d expected some resistance, despite the fact that Japan had never gone to more than level two alert, but after a quick explanation, he’d just shrugged his shoulders and treated her like any other customer. She heard him muttering something about Hinata House and how compared to that, this was nothing, but he’d treated her with the utmost courtesy.</p><p class="double">Twilight had set an Apple Bloom built universal data-pad to download X-Com’s main database before she’d appeared in their main control and distracted them. Having Dr Vahlen’s clearances and not giving her time to change them before Twilight accessed them had meant the entire system had been pretty much an open book. She hadn’t had time to review it fully, but a quick-learn spell had given her the gist, covering the gaps in Dr Vahlen’s knowledge. It was how she’d decided where to go, though Japan would have probably been on her list anyway.</p><p class="double">At the moment she was the only one in the women’s side of the bath, though most of the (female) staff had been cycling through, supposedly checking if she needed anything, but she suspected just to see she was for real. She had no doubt at least one of them had taken some camera phone footage of her in the corridors, but she’d rigged her data-pad to monitor any outgoing data or calls for certain patterns, and set up an area alarm spell covering the resort to identify any approaching soldiers or police.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately though from the many futuristic loops she’d been through she had command of technologies that X-Com would give their collective eye-teeth for, she couldn’t use it openly – as in-loop Equestria was its usual tech level, roughly 1930’s base-line earth with magic buffing it in places and a good dollop of magitek outright blurring the lines. Later on she’d be able to justify some knowledge through local study and genius, but she was still limited. Magic, on the other hand, she could go to town on.</p><p class="double">Still, for the moment she was just relaxing. She’d had half an hour in her room to rest before the bath was empty, but the vegetable sushi they’d delivered had been delicious, and went well with the rest of contents of the jug. There had also been a cotton yakuta, a simpler version of a kimono, on the bed for the use of a guest. While it hadn’t been much use in its base state, a few spells learned from Rarity had adapted it to her body shape, and changed the structural colour of the white cotton to purple, with her cutie mark emblazoned on the flank. As a joke, she even enlarged one of the umbrellas from the pina colada as an accessory.</p><p class="double">Umbrella and yakuta both now lay in a basket in the changing area, along with soap and shampoo, which she’d used extensively with the shower before getting in the bath. The reactions of the staff as she’d emerged had been fun, and asking for toiletries had managed to calm any fears that she would mess up the baths proper. </p><p class="double">She could see why. The bath was an area the size of a small swimming pool, a mostly natural bowl in the hillside surrounded with pumice and screened from the outside by bamboo walls. The whole effect was pleasing, and the warmth and minerals in the water washed away her cares and aches as effectively as any of Aloe and Lotus’s herbal formulas. In fact, she could tell that someone, probably a Shinto priest with at least some degree of talent, had blessed the place once. The spell had decayed, but it was a good effort for someone who’d basically been working by guess.</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed as she renewed the spell and tidied it up, making it self-sustaining off of the natural geo-thaumic energies that the hot spring produced. It was roughly equivalent to taking a dug-out canoe made by someone who had no knowledge of physics beyond what he could see, and using a degree in nautical engineering and all the right craft skills to rebuild it as a speed boat.</p><p class="double">After all, she felt she owed the staff here for how accommodating they’d been, and it should fix the chronic damage she’d detected in the manager’s leg, and the many other old injuries. From the jigsaw puzzle his bones were, it was a wonder he’d survived whatever had caused it.</p><p class="double">She had a plan to obtain some operating capital, while she had tonnes of gold and valuable materials stored in her sub-space pocket, as always she didn’t intend to do anything that broke her in-loop persona. Having that one bag of gold and gems, no more than 20 kilograms as her ‘official’ starting cash would make things slightly more challenging. It would be a definite good deed while also announcing her presence in no uncertain terms, and net her some cash and another couple of hundred kilos of gold.</p><p class="double">More healing spells on hospitals where casualties from alien attacks were still recovering, maybe raising her own small island to grow potions ingredients, repair spells to speed up the rebuilding, donations to aid organisations once she got some revenue producing activities going, and of course some Mysterious Mare-do-Well antics when and where the opportunity presented itself, yes she’d have plenty to keep herself occupied.</p><p class="double">It should go to redeeming the idea that aliens were not necessarily evil, and raising X-Com’s collective blood-pressure, which gave her a warm little glow… No, that was her perimeter alarm triggering. But it wasn’t X-Com or even the JSDF, it was some of the invaders, and they were heading towards the onsen!</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Of course they were little threat to Twilight herself. Calling a match up between a dozen of the invaders and an alicorn of Twilight&#039;s age and power a curb-stomp was like calling the interaction between a snail crawling on a curb and a descending foot a curb-stomp. Technically accurate, but somehow lacking the full measure of the mismatch.</p><p class="double">The question was, why here and now? Narrative causality? Then Twilight realised there was an easier explanation. She&#039;d found the after action report on her capture, and the reaction of the team&#039;s psychic to her uncontrolled magic. Using Doctor Vahlen&#039;s knowledge, she quickly had a pretty good working theory of what was happening. She lifted herself out of the water and dried herself off by creating a telekinetic shield flush to her fur and flicking away every droplet, which arced around to form a fist sized sphere that she dropped back in the pool.</p><p class="double">Now dry, she marched through the changing area to the doors, grabbing her yukata and stepping into it without breaking stride. She was still binding the belt when she opened the door and found the receptionist, Kimiko standing guard. “Twilight-san? Is there something wrong with the baths? The service?”</p><p class="double">“No, not the baths. You&#039;ve all been great!” Twilight smiled up at her, then sombered up. “But I have to see the manager, urgently!”</p><p class="double">As she entered the managers office she decided not to beat around the bush. “There are aliens coming, bad ones! I had an alarm spell out against unexpected visitors, but I didn&#039;t expect any this... er, unexpected. X-Com, that secret defence agency I told you about must have shot them down somewhere near here then lost them.”</p><p class="double">Kimiko gasped, but Urashima frowned. “There was a bright shooting star in the sky several weeks ago. It scared people, but when nothing else happened, people ignored it. Why now? You?”</p><p class="double">“I think so.” Twilight shook her head. “I swear, I had no idea this could happen, but I think my magic interferes with their psionic technology. I must be like a beacon to them. Now I know what&#039;s happening, I can damp it, but that won&#039;t stop them.”</p><p class="double">“What can?” The manager got up and limped over to the window. “There are only half-a-dozen guests, thankfully it&#039;s quiet, but there are twice that many staff. If you leave, will they follow?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but I don&#039;t know where I could lead them that wouldn&#039;t bring someone else into danger. I don&#039;t think you have time to evacuate and they&#039;re coming from the northwest.”</p><p class="double">“And that access road to the highway sweeps round that way... you think they will fire on our cars?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, but I think the safest option is for everyone to stay in the building while I put a force shield around it.”</p><p class="double">“Strong enough to stop these things from getting in?”</p><p class="double">“Strong enough to stop anything short of one of your heavy air-to-ground missiles.” Twilight tapped her horn with a hoof. “This isn&#039;t just for show you know.”</p><p class="double">Actually it would probably soak a tactical nuke, but she didn&#039;t want to give away her full power. Urashima just nodded and picked up his phone handset, punching an internal combination. Seconds later he spoke and Twilight and Kimiko could hear the P.A system relaying his instructions.</p><p class="double">“So, what will you do?” Kimiko asked. “Help keep the shield up until someone comes to rescue us?”</p><p class="double">“No, I have to go out to face them.” Both humans looked at her in shock. “Hopefully X-Com will respond, but they&#039;ll take time getting here. If the aliens can&#039;t get in, who knows where else they&#039;ll go, who else they&#039;ll harm? Besides, X-Com sees me as just another specimen, probably &#039;capture or kill at all costs&#039; after the way I escaped.”</p><p class="double">“But you said you&#039;re a librarian, a researcher, not a soldier!” Kimiko exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“I was also Princess Celestia&#039;s protege, and one of her go-to troubleshooters.” Twilight said, “I&#039;ve been in fights before. And that was before I became an alicorn. Trust me, I can protect you all.”</p><p class="double">Urashima put his hand over the mouthpiece and said, “Well, everyone&#039;s inside.”</p><p class="double">“Good!” Twilight&#039;s horn glowed fiercely, and a purple wash descended past the window. She made another small gem appear which glowed briefly, runes embedding themselves in it in lines of fire. She dropped it in the manager&#039;s hand. “To bring down the shield, press this against it and say the word &#039;release&#039; three times.”</p><p class="double">Her head turned slightly, as if she was looking at something only she could see. “They&#039;re here, I have to go.”</p><p class="double">Kimiko dropped to her knees and put her arms around the alicorn. “Good...”</p><p class="double">Both of them vanished in a flash of white light.</p><p class="double">“... luck?” Kimiko looked around. They were back in the ladies bath area, the surface of the shield rising behind them in a great dome, covering the entire complex of buildings, but not the gardens or baths themselves. Twilight shook herself free.</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and Kimiko was lifted and pushed back through the shield, which rippled and let her through. Meanwhile Twilight stepped out from the walkway onto the water surface closing her eyes and breathing deeply. Zecora&#039;s training came back to her, supplemented by later knowledge from dozens of loops, and the water supported her, stilling to a mirror surface under the ripples from her hooves.</p><p class="double">She had a dozen ways she could take them out, two dozen if she wasn&#039;t worried about damaging the scenery, but now the civilians were as safe as she could make them, she didn&#039;t have to go quick and dirty. Using massive over-power might also scare people. No, this was definitely the place for a more elegant form of combat from a bygone age, a long long time ago, in a galaxy far away. Besides, she needed the practice.</p><p class="double">She could justify it in loop as a lost form of unicorn martial art she&#039;d been recreating as a private project. Of course, she couldn&#039;t explain a light-sabre, but she&#039;d long since come up with a work-around for that. A purple energy blade extended from the tip of her horn with a low hum, then detached to hover in front of her in a guard position.</p><p class="double">Kimiko did what any modern person did when faced with something extraordinary, pulled out her phone and started filming. Three Sectoids, small humanoids, bulb headed and hunched, dropped over the edges of the bamboo screen between the bath and the forest outside, and immediately shot at her with their plasma pistols. The energy blade in front of her moved with almost lazy sweeps, intercepting the bolts and flinging them skywards or into the waters between them.</p><p class="double">Even as the duel started, three Floaters flew over the barrier, a form of barely humanoid cyborg who had a body made up of just a torso with a pair of jet engines built into it&#039;s back. Their plamsa rifles increased the odds to six to one, but Twilight&#039;s energy blade kept deflecting the bolts, slowly moving forward. As a Sectoid got to the water&#039;s edge she deflected a Floater bolt into the water in front of it, blinding it with a burst of steam, and then she moved, wings flapping once to shoot her across in front of it as it reeled back, her horn glowing.</p><p class="double">It was enveloped in purple light, and shrunk down as she overflew it, leaving behind a plant pot with a geranium in, plasma pistol lying beside it. She flipped over in mid-air and rebounded off part of the rockery wall, still deflecting the few energy blasts that were anywhere near target. Her wings swept again, drawing up steam from the hot waters below and flinging it in front of her, engulfing one of the Floaters. The cloud shrunk and condensed to the density of candy floss, darkening at the same time.</p><p class="double">Using its bulk as a screen from the other two she flew towards it and spun to give it a kick with both hind-hooves. Lightning flashed and crackled throughout the cloud, and the Floater dropped out of it to splash into the water below, engines dead and cybernetics shorted out. The cloud was instantly shredded by plasma fire from the other two Floaters, but not before Twilight had popped up from behind it and used it as a springboard to flip through the air over their heads.</p><p class="double">One got transformed into a Floater shaped balloon, while the other was hit by the plasma pistols of both remaining Sectoids as she ducked behind it and they frantically tried to register on her. It exploded, leaving her exposed, but the two aliens had no time to use this as they were grabbed by her telekinetic force and flung together, smacking their heads against each others. Twilight landed and dropped the two in front of her, changing them to a potted lily and a small spiny cactus.</p><p class="double">Twilight brought her energy blade up into guard position again, and gave a great downbeat with her wings shooting up to fly over the bamboo wall. There were flashes and the sounds of plasma fire, and then the bamboo screen was smashed down as Twilight was flung backwards through it, curled up and glowing with a purple aura. She hit the pumice spire that formed the centrepiece of the bath and went straight through it, smashing the spire to splinters. She finally uncurled and flung her wings out, arresting her flight and dropped down to stand on the water again.</p><p class="double">The Muton, a hulking humanoid in sculpted armour that had clearly back-handed her through the wall, raised it&#039;s arms and roared in triumph or to call it&#039;s allies. It found this was unwise when the purple alicorn flashed from where she stood to right in front of him and blasted him with magic. He was instantly transformed into a cherry tree. Unfortunately it didn&#039;t completely block the hole and a trio of Chryssalids, three legged mantis-like aliens with scythe tipped arms skittered through the gap, forcing her to fall back.</p><p class="double">She ran backwards out onto the water and one leapt in after her, splashing it&#039;s way through more slowly than it&#039;s initial rush. Her horn glowed and the water swirled up in a waterspout to engulf it, then froze, leaving it encased in a block of ice. The other two made massive leaps onto the now flattened central rock spire, getting behind her. The remaining rubble shot upwards with a purple glow of telekinesis, battering their undersides and giving her time to turn and face the threat.</p><p class="double">One Chryssalid&#039;s scythe arms swept down to spear her, but her energy blade flew up and extended to the length of a bo staff, horizontal in the air to catch them by the &#039;elbows&#039;. The other leapt again to get behind her, and intercepted a pair of hind hooves glowing with energy on the way down. It was thrown all the way back to crash into the cherry tree where it slumped, leaking ichor. Twilight&#039;s energy blade continued to duel with the twin arm blades of her opponent, finally feinting to make it over-reach itself.</p><p class="double">As the blades speared out to pierce her through and through, she down-winged and jumped flying over then and bringing her energy blade down in a sweep that sliced them off, leaving stubs. The Chryssalid creeled in agony, but was quickly cut short as it was transformed into a spider plant. The ichor leaking one was similarly transformed.</p><p class="double">But before she could take a breath, a series of explosions blasted away a good section of the wall, reducing the bamboo to smouldering splinters . Two more Mutons stood there, flanking a massive bi-pod war machine with a row of four glowing lights on it&#039;s main body like unblinking eyes, a Sectopod. Twilight was once again reduced to deflecting and dodging fire as the two humanoids fired their plasma rifles continuously.</p><p class="double">The frozen Chryssalid was hauled into the air and flung at the Sectopod by Twilight&#039;s telekinesis, but it blasted the block of ice and it&#039;s prisoner into shards and steam. A few seconds later one of the mutons dropped an alien grenade in the water underneath her and she was engulfed as it exploded, creating a huge dome of scalding steam even as the Sectopod fired again sweeping the volume with energy cannon fire that pierced it, and was absorbed by the dome shield.</p><p class="double">Kimiko, who had been recording the fight eagerly, screamed out in shock. “Twilight!”</p><p class="double">The Mutons strode forward as the steam started to disperse, spreading out to either side of the Sectopod and sweeping the area with their plasma rifles. One fired at Kimiko, causing her to shriek and hunch away, but the shield absorbed it without a ripple.</p><p class="double">Suddenly a massive burst of purple light from behind them blasted the other Muton forward into the air, flinging him against the shield to slump down like a rag doll. His plasma rifle was ripped away from him by a familiar purple glow. The other Muton spun on the spot to target Twilight Sparkle, who was standing behind and between the legs of the Sectopod, yukata ripped and smouldering and with her mane askew, but very much alive and very much annoyed.</p><p class="double">His plasma bolt was absorbed in mid-air by an incandescent indigo ball of force that continued on to strike him, throwing him back against the force field and earthing itself into the shield with crackles of purple lightning. He slumped down against it alongside his comrade. The Sectopod was now aware that it&#039;s opponent was right behind it, but had no time to do anything as it was hauled upwards as if on an elastic band, weapons facing upwards.</p><p class="double">Twilight flew up after it, her energy blade forming above her horn and extending to bo staff length. She came up underneath the robot and the indigo line of energy pierced it from back plate to front, right through it&#039;s main control nexus. The row of lights dimmed and died out, and the legs went limp.</p><p class="double">Twilight glided down, letting the wrecked robot land between the two Mutons, and transforming them into palm trees almost as an afterthought. She landed back where she&#039;d originally started standing on the water that stilled under her hooves, and looked around, her energy blade shrinking back into her horn. “Oh my gosh! What a mess!”</p><p class="double">She lowered her head and raised it, and three balls of water floated up from the bath to slowly orbit her. Her horn glowed with energy, golden this time, and the water exploded outwards in a wave that engulfed the entire area with golden energy. As it slid off the shield and Kimiko was able to see out again, she found that all the battle damage had vanished, the bamboo screening was once more intact, the bath clear of debris and the pumice spire was restored. Indeed the entire bath looked pristine, not so much as a leaf floating on the water. Even Twilight was once more in an immaculate yukata with not a hair in her mane or tail out of place. The secretary finally found her voice, though she didn&#039;t stop recording.</p><p class="double">“That was... amazing!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to face her, blushing. “Yes well, customers are expected to leave the baths in the condition they find it. It said so on the sign in the changing rooms.”</p><p class="double">“Not that!” Kimiko giggled. “Though that was awesome too! I mean the zapping and the kapowing and whooshing and the whole martial arts bad-ass Jedi spell-caster thing!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that.” Twilight said dismissively. I said I could take care of myself, didn&#039;t I? I&#039;ve been redeveloping an ancient unicorn martial arts style. It&#039;s a fascinating project, though even I didn&#039;t expect it to be so effective, though that might just be the extra power boost from being an alicorn. Of course I added some new elements to it, like water walking. I learned that from a wise zebra shaman, also precision control of my telekinesis.”</p><p class="double">“So I see. You&#039;re doing it right now.”</p><p class="double">“No I&#039;m... It takes great focus to maintain the increased surface tension...”</p><p class="double">She glanced down. There was the expression of horrified realisation, the frantic little fore-hoof dance, and the classic “Aaaahhhaaa!” Sploosh!</p><p class="double">Kimiko couldn&#039;t help it, she burst out laughing. It didn&#039;t help when a pair of ears emerged above the water and moved towards the edge of the bath like a pair of parallel sharks. One hoof, and then another grappled over the edge of the bath, and hauled up a very bedraggled Twilight, mane matted over her face with her eyes closed. She spit out a stream of water. Kimiko was by this time gasping for air.</p><p class="double">“Oh sure, laugh it up!” A glow formed around Twilight and she lifted herself out onto the walkway. “You recorded that too?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry, but it was very funny.” Kimiko calmed down. “Look, I&#039;ll edit that out. You don&#039;t mind me posting the rest to some sites I know?”</p><p class="double">Twilight repeated her instant drying spell and was once more neat and dry. “It&#039;s okay, leave it in. My ego&#039;s not so fragile that I can&#039;t take a joke at my expense. Besides, I want people to know I&#039;m not like those things. Humans are afraid of aliens, and from this lot, rightly so, but my friend Pinkie Pie taught me long ago that it&#039;s hard to be scared of something when you&#039;re laughing at it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped through the shield like it was open air. “Let&#039;s go tell Mr Urashima that the trouble is over.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, the way you killed those aliens...”</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t kill anyone!” Twilight huffed. “Well, I guess you could call destroying those golems, no robots, killing, but the ones I turned into potted plants are still alive. I could even turn them back, though I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be doing them any favours, as X-Com would probably just kill them for real. I first did it by accident on my entrance exam to Princess Celestia&#039;s School for Gifted Unicorns. Turned both my parents into plants. Thankfully they turned back soon afterwards.”</p><p class="double">Kimiko shivered. “They won&#039;t turn back by themselves, will they?”</p><p class="double">“Not with this version of the spell. Only I can reverse it, otherwise it&#039;s permanent.”</p><p class="double">“Well it was really impressive. You probably couldn’t hear me but I was cheering &#039;banzai&#039; the whole time.”</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “Shouldn&#039;t that be bonsai?”</p><p class="double">Kimiko groaned as they reached the manager&#039;s office. Keitaro called out for them to come in at the knock and slumped back in his seat when he saw it was the two of them. “Thank the kami, you&#039;re both safe! The aliens, they have been dealt with?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight took them all out, it was so cool!” Kimiko replied, and held up the camera. “I even have video! She even cleaned up afterwards!”</p><p class="double">Twilight added. “Not quite. There are a bunch of potted plants and some broken robots lying on the walkway outside the women&#039;s wash area. But don&#039;t worry, when X-Com get here they&#039;ll take them all away. Oh, that reminds me could I get a copy of that film?”</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t know you had a laptop?” Kimiko said, puzzled.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t need one. Just hold that phone against my horn.” She did as she was asked, and silvery threads slid down the grooves inn her horn as it glowed. “I originally developed this spell for reading books fast, pretty much any kind of paperwork where you didn&#039;t want to actually have to go through it. Based on a spell to share memories. Turns out it works just as well on other forms of stored information.”</p><p class="double">She took her horn away and pointed it away from them. A glow appeared at the tip, and a window formed in the air, showing a few seconds from the fight. “Got it!”</p><p class="double">Seh turned to see the two humans were gob-smacked. “What? I raise an energy shield over the entire place and this is what impresses you? Kimiko, I think you&#039;d better get that stuff uploaded as widely as possible, and as soon as possible, before X-Com take that too.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, of course!” Kimiko practically flew out of the room.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to the Keitaro. “I&#039;ve had enough of a bath for one night. Could I use my room until X-Com get here? I really don&#039;t want to stick around after that.”</p><p class="double">“Of course, Twilight-dono.” Keitaro bowed his head. “And thank you, for saving all of us.”</p><p class="double">“No need for that formal stuff, it was my fault you were in harms way in the first place.” The bag of gold appeared and she placed a stack of coins and a couple of small gems, maybe a half kilo worth on his desk. “I&#039;d better settle up while I&#039;m here, that should cover it.”</p><p class="double">The manager reached out and pushed it back. “I can&#039;t accept this. I meant what I said.”</p><p class="double">&quot;So did I.&quot; Twilight pushed it back. &quot;I need to pay my way, and show I have. Otherwise X-Com, or some other bunch that&#039;s scared of me, will claim I mind controlled you all, or something. Oh, and I&#039;d suggest you take a long bath yourself. I have a feeling it will be good for your leg, for all of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Keeitaro&#039;s eyes narrowed in thought. &quot;You did something to the baths?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well someone did, a long time ago. I may have... improved their work slightly. Healing spells aren&#039;t my speciality, but I am widely read in all fields of magic. I made it relatively slow acting, you need to bathe several times to get the full benefit.&quot; She looked around conspiratorially. &quot;Don&#039;t tell anyone, some idiot will probably get all freaked out about it. Just let the results speak for themselves.&quot;</p><p class="double">Keitaro finally accepted some gold, but only enough to cover the regular cost of a stay and the yukata she&#039;d modified. “If you want to do something more, make sure you say good-bye to Kimiko before you go. She seems to have taken a shine to you.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, if you&#039;re sure...” Twilight yawned and put a hoof to her face. “Oh my, I guess that fight took more out of me than I thought. I&#039;ll get off to my room. Goodnight, and if I don&#039;t get chance to see you again, farewell.”</p><p class="double">As she went up to her room, Twilight reflected on how well things had gone. She hadn&#039;t intended to be filmed, but when she realised she had she did do things slightly more flamboyantly then she might otherwise have. Still, the bit at the end had been pure serendipity, her concentration failing at just the right moment for maximum comic impact. That would do more to cement her reputation as non-hostile than a hundred heartfelt speeches.</p><p class="double">She stripped off her yukata and climbed up into the big, human sized bed and snuggled down under the covers. She had just enough energy left to reset her alarm spell before she drifted off to sleep. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>36.4</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped up to the hill overlooking Sweet Apple Acres. “So... I understand that these need to be picked, then?”</p><p class="double">Mac nodded. “Yup.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around. “There&#039;s a lot of them.”</p><p class="double">The stallion positively exuded agreement.</p><p class="double">“Okay. I think I can do this.”</p><p class="double">“Why you?” Mac said, turning to her and wincing. “Ah know why ah ain&#039;t doin&#039; it, but...”</p><p class="double">“Oh. I lost a bet with Applejack.” Twilight looked Mac over. “Are you all right? I heard you strained something...”</p><p class="double">“Ah&#039;ll be fine.” Mac grimaced. “Ah ain&#039;t goin&#039; t&#039; the doctor, anyways. Not after-”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough,” Twilight said. “I remember Spike shouting about his eyes burning?”</p><p class="double">Mac blushed. “Neither of us is much good at winnin&#039; bets with mah sister, ah&#039;d guess.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Okay... here we go.”</p><p class="double">The whole forest began to glow purple.</p><p class="double">Whistling something, Twilight corralled the thousands of apples into distinct streams and began decanting them into barrels. Each barrel was carefully packed in a cubic-crystal efficient packing arrangement, then sealed and stacked in the convenient nearby barn.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s done,” she said, five minutes later. “I fancy a coffee. Want me to get you something?”</p><p class="double">Mac thought for a moment about what he&#039;d seen, and quickly came to a conclusion.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d prefer tea, thank you.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, Fluttershy?” Raindrops asked. “Not seen you up here in a while. We thought you were afraid of flying...”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, and shuffled back to the centre of the cloud she was on.</p><p class="double">“Oh! Sorry. But, er... why?”</p><p class="double">“Bet with Dash,” Fluttershy whispered, then kicked the cloud uncertainly.</p><p class="double">It summarily failed to pop.</p><p class="double">“Er... how does this work again?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack whistled.</p><p class="double">Winona nodded to a covey of birds, which took off and headed over to the latest hoof-ful of grain the farmpony had set out.</p><p class="double">One of the geese tried to move forward out of turn, and Winona growled briefly.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Applejack said eventually. “Now it&#039;s y&#039;all turn, Angel.”</p><p class="double">The bunny gave her a dismissive look.</p><p class="double">“Well, y&#039; eat what ah give you, or y&#039; don&#039;t eat today.” Applejack got out a carrot. “Ah shoulda never made that bet with Fluttershy, ah can tell you...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Look,” Dash said wearily. “I can&#039;t do dressmaking, so this is basically the only option I had left.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo made a bizarre sound as she tried to hold in gales of laughter.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah...” the speedster muttered, shifting slightly in the huge, frilly white dress she was... <i>ensconced</i> in. “Take it from me, squirt. Only make a bet when you&#039;re sure you&#039;ll win it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...and that is how to make a cake with style!” Rarity finished. “With flair, with grace, with panache!”</p><p class="double">Carrot Cake examined it. “Is there... anything under the cream?”</p><p class="double">“Well, no...” Rarity admitted. “Is that a problem?”</p><p class="double">By way of demonstration, Carrot Cake took up a cake slicer and tried to cut a slice.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Rarity said, as the entire Rarity&#039;s Stylish Cream Puff Cake stuck to the slicer. “This is a lot harder than Pinkie makes it look...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess sunbutt!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Pinkie here! Hey, this week we all learned that Gambling Can Be Embarassing!

I know he wanted the Crystal Heart, but what he was going to <i>do</i> with it? No idea.” Spike shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Well, I know what to do next time,” Twilight said. “Hmmm...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight?” Celestia said, pushing open the door to the library. “Are you there?”</p><p class="double">No response.</p><p class="double">“How strange.”</p><p class="double">Celestia thought hard. Her messages via Spike had only received terse replies about some &#039;experiment&#039;, so she had come to check on her student in person, in advance of giving her the first &#039;solo&#039; mission she would have.</p><p class="double">Her eyes alighted on a note resting on the table.</p><p class="double">“Dear Princess,” she read. “I have recently discovered that the Crystal Empire has returned. I have made haste to their capital, in order to assess the situation.”</p><p class="double">Celestia frowned, then her eyes widened. “She doesn&#039;t know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“So, King Sombra, we deliver unto you the Crystal Heart,” Twilight finished, putting the large hunk of crystal on the floor.</p><p class="double">Sombra looked at it. “<b>Crystal</b>?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Crystal,” Twilight agreed.</p><p class="double">“Are you sure this is okay?” Spike asked, looking nervous. “He looks evil...”</p><p class="double">“So did Nightmare Moon,” Twilight pointed out.</p><p class="double">“She <i>was</i> evil!” Spike said. “Luna isn&#039;t, but that&#039;s not the same thing...”</p><p class="double">“Sssh, I want to see what happens.” Twilight pointed.</p><p class="double">Sombra arose from his throne, darkness drifting around him, and approached the great relic...</p><p class="double">Then paused.</p><p class="double"><b>“What now?”</b></p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “Oh, you must be joking.”</p><p class="double">Sombra tapped the crystal heart, which went <i>tink.</i> <b>“Crystal? Crys-tal?”</b></p><p class="double">One wall exploded, admitting Celestia. “Twilight! Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“Fine, thanks,” Twilight said, dropping a reflex-quick shimmershield. “I wanted to see if King Sombra could do anything with the Crystal Heart. It turns out... not.”</p><p class="double">Celestia took in the situation. Twilight, fine... Spike, scared but fine... the Crystal Heart, unscathed but dusty... and King Sombra&#039;s horn sticking out of a pile of rubble.</p><p class="double">“I see. Wasn&#039;t that awfully risky?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “I keyed it to a teleport, so I <i>could</i> technically summon it to me if needed. It&#039;s a tricky spell, involves writing a runic form of my name on the object in magic, but useful.”</p><p class="double">Celestia poked the pile of rubble, which mumbled something about crystals.</p><p class="double">“I remember him being more dangerous...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">36.6</p><p class="double">Twilight could just about <i>taste</i> something off about this Loop.</p><p class="double">She wasn&#039;t sure what, she wasn&#039;t sure how, but this loop was NOT standard.</p><p class="double">All that said, though, it certainly <i>looked</i> normal. Twilight and her friends (all six of them Awake) were in Ponyville, as normal. The Summer Sun celebration had proceeded as planned, then not as planned, then as normal for a standard-issue loop.</p><p class="double">(They&#039;d gone with the old standby of Twilight getting the Elements working first try, and all six of them blasting Nightmare Moon&#039;s smoke-form as she tried to kidnap Twilight.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Applejack gathered up her crop for the year (the hard way, relatively speaking, to test out some mental trick or other she&#039;d picked up to help with tiredness), Twilight wondered if she was just imagining things.</p><p class="double">Then she vanished in a puff of smoke.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She materialized, horn flaring and muscles tense with alarm, in a grassy field.</p><p class="double">With a human (boy, but with white hair) looking at her.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">The boy stared for another moment, then jumped into the air. “Awesome! Maybe not as cool as I was hoping, but the chicks will love it!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, what&#039;s going on?” she asked, confused.</p><p class="double">“Oh.” The boy stopped jumping. “I&#039;m Jiraiya. Your new summoner!”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at him for another moment, then facehoofed.</p><p class="double">So much for normal loop... they were replacing the <i>toad summons.</i></p><p class="double">Sighing, Twilight looked up. “Okay, then. My name&#039;s Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">Jiraiya winced. “Yeah, that&#039;s not going to win me any manly points with Orochimaru... but I&#039;m pretty sure Tsunade will love you guys!”</p><p class="double">He sidled up to her. “Women like fuzzy animals, right?”</p><p class="double">Twilight felt like facehoofing again. This was <i>definitely</i> Jiraiya.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Wait,” Pinkie said, raising a hoof. “Does this mean we&#039;re way back in time from when Naruto normally kicks butt and stuff?”</p><p class="double">“It... does, actually,” Twilight confirmed. “Tell you what. Let&#039;s try and work out how to seriously reduce the scale of problems the ninja world has. Any thoughts?”</p><p class="double">Dash slammed a hoof onto the table. “We gotta turn the country of Rain into the country of pleasant weather! Maybe then they&#039;d be less of jerks all the time.”</p><p class="double">Rummaging in her pocket, Twilight withdrew one of her trusty PADDs. “Let&#039;s see... yep... yep... that can be blamed on him too... that may be a plot hole... yep... no... and yep.”</p><p class="double">She looked up. “Well, I found the source of about eighty percent of all the problems in the Ninja world ever.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, let me guess,” Applejack said sarcastically.</p><p class="double">“Exactly. Madara Uchiha.” Twilight projected an image onto a wall. “This guy is responsible for just about everything.”</p><p class="double">“So, what&#039;s the plan?” Dash asked. “We hit him until he stops?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Twilight replied, projecting up another picture. “This is, as we know, Orochimaru. He&#039;s responsible for most of the remaining twenty percent.”</p><p class="double">Rarity shivered. “The snake motif is <i>not</i> doing it for me. There&#039;s such a thing as going too far.”</p><p class="double">The others gave her sidelong glances.</p><p class="double">“What?” she asked, looking back at them. “Spikey-wikey is a dragon. Completely different.”</p><p class="double">“<i>I&#039;m</i> not arguing with you.” Twilight shook her head. “We&#039;re getting off track. Anyway, I think I see an opportuinty for societal engineering. We&#039;re between Ninja Wars right now, so... who in Equestria do we know is an experienced psychologist?”</p><p class="double">“I learned!” Pinkie said, raising a hoof.</p><p class="double">“...I think we&#039;ll put that in the emergency folder,” Twilight decided. “You&#039;re a little... exuberant at times.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy cleared her throat. “I am qualified and have doctorates.”</p><p class="double">“That works,” Dash said.</p><p class="double">“I think Luna can do it by dreamwalking, too...” Twilight mused. “I&#039;ll ask her.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p><b>“So,”</b> Kurama said, lying back on a gigantic couch. <b>“Part of it is, I feel like the Sage just... abandoned us. We were only just created, and he left us – and his sons were complete-”</b></p><p class="double">Luna shook her head. “We can relate, in a sense. Did We tell you the story of Our banishment?”</p><p class="double">The huge fox twisted to look at her. <b>“No, actually.”</b></p><p class="double">“Perhaps &#039;twill prove useful for thy own actualization.” Luna closed her eyes. “Ere long ago, perhaps so long as the time thy Sage had so recently made the moon...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So...” Madara said slowly. “You want to &#039;cure&#039; me, little summon?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t think I have a problem in the first place.” His eyes twisted into the Mangekyo. “So-”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy met his gaze.</p><p class="double">To an onlooker, it would have been as though little explosions of pure optic intent were going off between them.</p><p class="double">“...why did Izuna always manage to do everything right?” Madara asked plaintively. “I tried as hard as I could...”</p><p class="double">“There, there,” Fluttershy said, trotting over. “Just let it out, you&#039;ll feel better.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the book in her hooves.</p><p class="double">It was one of Jiraiya&#039;s. It was also rather better written than normal – though the subject matter was about the same.</p><p class="double">“I never should have let him and Dash collaborate...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">36.7</p><p class="double">“Oh, gods, where are we <i>now?”</i> a somewhat scruffy unicorn asked, adjusting his floppy hat. He then paused.</p><p class="double">“And how did I do that?”</p><p class="double">The glasses-wearing earth pony next to him shrugged. “I don&#039;t know either. Still, this looks like another one of those Fused Loops.”</p><p class="double">“Great. More exciting things to run away from.”</p><p class="double">A large pegasus flapped down to land next to them in a whir of wings. “Greetings!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, not <i>you</i> again,” the unicorn muttered.</p><p class="double">Looking down at himself, the pegasus frowned. “I am fairly sure it <i>is</i> me.”</p><p class="double">“Wait – what&#039;s that on your, er... arse?” asked the unicorn, pointing.</p><p class="double">“It looks like...” the earth pony squinted closer, adjusting his glasses. “A carrot.”</p><p class="double">“How appropriate,” the unicorn said, then his eyes widened and he turned to look at his own flank. “What in the gods&#039; name is <i>this?”</i></p><p class="double">“A dotted line around... a staff-shape, I think.” The pegasus shook his head. “No idea.”</p><p class="double">“And mine is... a pair of flowers.” Shrugging, the earth pony looked around. “Do you think we should try and find out where the nearest town is?”</p><p class="double">“No,” the unicorn replied promptly. “I like the sound of quiet.”</p><p class="double">“I believe there is a town on the horizon,” the pegasus said, pointing. “I don&#039;t know exactly how far, though.”</p><p class="double">“I can handle it.” With a shy smile, the earth pony closed his eyes.</p><p class="double">Abruptly, there was <i>something</i> there. The <i>something</i> was very, very big, a gorgeous gold in colour, and possessed of many scales.</p><p class="double">“Hello, Ninereeds!”</p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t know how you keep doing that,” the unicorn muttered. “Twoflower, do you really want us to go flying into the air on him?”</p><p class="double">“You didn&#039;t have a problem with it before, Rincewind,” Twoflower pointed out.</p><p class="double">“I have come to terms with a fear of heights,” Rincewind defended. “It is an old friend, who I meet most weeks. However, the fear of <i>falling off</i> is rather stronger than normal, on account of my uncharacteristic lack of hands.”</p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t wizards cast some kind of spell to stop them falling?” the pegasus asked, frowning faintly.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ve been over this before, Carrot,” Rincewind said with a wince. “Even <i>if</i> other wizards can do it – and I&#039;m not at all certain they could – I... sort of can&#039;t. I&#039;m not what you might call <i>good</i> at casting spells. I&#039;m more of a theoretician.”</p><p class="double"><i>Do not worry, Rincewind,</i> Ninereeds projected. <i>I am quite good at catching falling wizzards. Surely you remember the many times I have been able to practise?</i></p><p class="double">“I&#039;d rather not, thank you...” Rincewind grimaced. “Oh, well, why wait for trouble to find us? We may as well meet it while there&#039;s still daylight to run away in.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“...well, that&#039;s quite an entrance,” Twilight said, as the huge dragon gently glided down to rest in the main square.</p><p class="double">A unicorn clutching a hat to his head with one hoof staggered down from the dragon&#039;s side, and collapsed on the floor.</p><p class="double">“I never want to go flying again.”</p><p class="double">“You said that last time,” said the dragon&#039;s... well, presumably rider, based on stance.</p><p class="double">“I mean it this time.”</p><p class="double">Trotting over, Twilight raised her voice. “Hello! Welcome to Ponyville. My name&#039;s Twilight Sparkle.” As she got closer, she lowered it again. “I&#039;m the local Loop Anchor, if that helps.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re the local anchor?” Hopping down from his perch, the earth pony fumbled around for a moment and brought out... a camera? “Can I get a photo? I like to have one of each anchor.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight answered. “Oh, who are you?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Twoflower,” the earth pony replied, checking on his device. A small lizard blinked sleepily at Twilight from the flash pan. “My friend there is Rincewind – he startles easily.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, so <i>you&#039;re</i> the loopers for the Disc?” Twilight smiled. “I have to say, it&#039;s nice to meet you.”</p><p class="double">“Pleasure,” Twoflower returned. “This is Ninereeds – though if you know about the Disc, you might well have guessed that.”</p><p class="double"><i>Hello, Twilight Sparkle.</i></p><p class="double">“And hello to you as well, Ninereeds.” Twilight looked directly at the dragon as she spoke. “I seem to remember Hiccup mentioning you once?”</p><p class="double"><i>Ah, that one. Toothless is most fun.</i></p><p class="double">“They certainly made me welcome,” Twoflower said. “Say &#039;butter!&#039;”</p><p class="double">FLASH.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Ah, so you&#039;re a looper as well?” Twilight sat back in her chair, as Spike passed around tea. “Thanks, Spike.”</p><p class="double">“No problem.” Spike handed Carrot his, and pulled over a spare chair.</p><p class="double">“I am,” Carrot nodded. “It&#039;s been... interesting.”</p><p class="double">He grimaced at his new hooves. “I certainly have new understanding of some of Angua&#039;s troubles...”</p><p class="double">Twoflower peered under a bookshelf. “Come on, Rincewind. Stop hiding under there.”</p><p class="double">“I am waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Rincewind said indistinctly. “It always does.”</p><p class="double">“Well, unless things not related to your arrival are seriously askew, then we should be fine.” Twilight grinned. “There is the matter of the dark goddess who should show up tomorrow morning-”</p><p class="double">Rincewind tried to get further under the bookshelf.</p><p class="double">“-but since we can handle her without breaking much of a sweat, I think we should be fine. And the same for the...” Twilight paused and counted. “Three other Princess-level or higher threats, half-dozen or so large monsters, and sundry minor catastrophes.”</p><p class="double">She chuckled. “I&#039;m teasing. Equestria is actually sort-of officially designated a sanctuary loop. We&#039;ll try to make your stay as comfortable as possible.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Twoflower walked back over, apparently abandoning Rincewind to his position under the bookshelves for now. “Don&#039;t worry, he&#039;ll come out eventually.”</p><p class="double">“Try me!” Rincewind called.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Whistling, Discord slid the book containing the Elements back into the bookshelf.</p><p class="double"><i>Hide it in plain sight.</i> Hilarious!</p><p class="double">As he turned to go, the bookshelf moved.</p><p class="double">“Oh?” he asked, peering under the bookshelf with one eye. Then he put the eye back in and bent down. “Hello, little pony.”</p><p class="double">“Wizzard, thank you!” a voice said back.</p><p class="double">Reaching in, Discord pulled out a blanket, a bathtub and three sets of goggles before finally towing a somewhat-scruffy unicorn out by the tail.</p><p class="double">“What were you doing in there?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn closed his eyes. “This cannot go well.”</p><p class="double">“How astute!” Discord poked his new prey in the cutie mark, which flashed, and grey spread all over his body.</p><p class="double">Then the building exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...oh, I almost forgot about him. Whoops...”</p><p class="double">Twilight and the others watched Discord flee across the fields, pursued by about fifty high-grade spells and a unicorn whose eyes blazed with eight-coloured fire.</p><p class="double">Twoflower winced at a particularly bright Ultima. “You know, I think Rincewind would be quite good at spells by now, if he just used a system other than the UU standard. He certainly knows <i>all</i> the theory.”</p><p class="double">They sat back to watch the fireworks for another few minutes.</p><p class="double">“Should we help him?” Carrot asked. “I mean, I know he&#039;s a criminal, but that <i>can&#039;t</i> be due process.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>36.8</p><p class="double">“Okay, boy, ready?” Spike said, bouncing on his claws.</p><p class="double">Peewee nodded.</p><p class="double">“Play dead!”</p><p class="double">The little phoenix chirped once, then erupted in a searing column of fire.</p><p class="double">Twilight chose that moment to walk in. “...okay. Spike, what am I looking at, and what&#039;s the reasonable explanation?”</p><p class="double">“Well, you&#039;re looking at a pillar of smoke and flame in the middle of the library,” Spike summarized.</p><p class="double">“Right. And the reasonable explanation?”</p><p class="double">The pyre died down, revealing an adult phoenix. Taking a single circuit around the room, singing, he then settled on Spike&#039;s shoulder and began to preen.</p><p class="double">“...that.” Spike pointed. “I taught Peewee a new trick.”</p><p class="double">“And you absolutely <i>had</i> to try it out on the library table?” Twilight asked, conjuring a dustpan and brush out of what had been a set of plaster ducks.</p><p class="double">Her assistant winced. “Oops. Well, in my defence, there <i>are</i> cookies cooling in the kitchen, and we might have got ash on them.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “Well, I suppose I can forgive a lot for a cookie. But we have a laboratory for a reason!”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged. “Trixie&#039;s in it, I think.”</p><p class="double">“...fair enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>36.9 – Elmagnifico</p><p class="double">Macintosh poured the fermented liquid into a carefully measured, reinforced container. It fizzed there for a second before settling down. He slid it next to two glasses of more mundane cider, where it would stay unless it was needed. </p><p class="double">This was one of those special occasions. </p><p class="double">&quot;So, this was ya&#039;ll&#039;s first kill?&quot; </p><p class="double">His customer sighed at her cider, her purple bangs almost hanging into it. </p><p class="double">&quot;No, but it&#039;s troubling me. There are so many questions. Jadis was a powerful witch, and in that world, those can always come back – she did, I brought her back. Probably guilt... So does it count? Could I have prevented her from using the Deplorable Word some other way? Would she have done so if I hadn&#039;t? She didn&#039;t use it in the books when she was getting overthrown. I&#039;ve had these arguments with myself often since then. I&#039;ve hurt things in self defence before, and fought eldritch horrors and creatures with terrible power, but this time I premeditated the destruction of a sentient being.&quot; </p><p class="double">The silence hung there for a second as Twilight paused. </p><p class="double">&quot;I wonder sometimes if there was a way to do it differently. I&#039;ve stopped evils with phenomenal cosmic power before without resorting to killing, and I had all the advantages of surprise and time. Perhaps a petrification spell, or illusion or transmogrification. I don&#039;t know. It was the only way I knew for sure would work.&quot; </p><p class="double">Macintosh wasn&#039;t sure what to say to that. He&#039;d never dropped a meteorite on someone&#039;s head. </p><p class="double">Quiet returned like a disapproving spectre. </p><p class="double">Twilight seemed content to stare at her drink despondently. </p><p class="double">Macintosh thought back.</p><p class="double">There was, in fact, something similar he&#039;d done. </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah remember mah first.&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight looked up at him, her expression urging him to continue. </p><p class="double">He hesitated. </p><p class="double">This wasn&#039;t like sharing the fact of his army experience, or even his looping. This was something deeply personal. A glimpse into his psyche, that could be used against him if shared recklessly. </p><p class="double">The violet eyes asking for elaboration reminded him that not only was he helping someone, this was a friend of his. One he could trust. </p><p class="double">&quot;It was one of them longer loops, just after th&#039; changeling invasion. A buncha them wound up scattered around tha countryside an&#039; started trouble. Royal guards arrived ta find an&#039; deal with &#039;em, but they musta missed one or summat. </p><p class="double">Mac realized he was rambling, and shook his head. </p><p class="double">&quot;The point being, one night ah just couldn&#039;t sleep. Took ta walkin&#039; tha grounds, checkin&#039; ta make sure everythin&#039; was tidy. Ah found it in one of the barns. It had taken the form of mah sister, probably waitin&#039; ta replace her that mornin&#039; or summat. It took me a minute to realize though. Ah thought ah was safe that loop. That Applejack was there, not some other mare.&quot; </p><p class="double">A tiny smile threatened Macintosh&#039;s face for a second. </p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;d probably kick mah shin but good if Applejack knew ah was talkin&#039; about her that way, but that&#039;s how ah thought back then.&quot; </p><p class="double">All trace of the smile vanished again as he got back on task. </p><p class="double">&quot;It tried to play it casual, like it couldn&#039;t sleep either. Wanted to make me think it was just makin&#039; sure the apples were growin&#039; right.&quot; </p><p class="double">He poked at his glass of cider with a quiet a sigh. </p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe ah took it as an insult. Ta imitate Applejack so well, and still be so off. To mock mah sister&#039;s depth of character that way.&quot; </p><p class="double">His voice took on a solemn, grim tone. This was no wistful matter. </p><p class="double">&quot;In any case, it made mah blood boil. Ah bucked it but good. Sent it sailing across the room an inta&#039; one of the barn&#039;s support beams. We built that barn to stand up to Rainbow Dash. Changeling snapped like a twig.&quot; </p><p class="double">Macintosh&#039;s frown deepened as he thought back, dredging up old excuses. </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah tried to rationalize it. That thing was gonna insinuate itself with mah family, cause no end of harm. No telling how it woulda reacted if ah tried to take it out nonlethally. Ah had no clue what kinda mumbo-jumbo them things could get up to. Better to neutralize it then and there. Ah liked that. Made it seem like a good thing. Like ah&#039;d helped. But it didn&#039;t stick.&quot; </p><p class="double">He looked the other looper in the eye. His voice softened. That wasn&#039;t Her, but it didn&#039;t change what he&#039;d thought then. </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah figured where that kinda thinkin&#039; might lead me.&quot; </p><p class="double">Then he switched his gaze to his cider, the heat in his ears drawing his eyes to the drink, and his mind back to the story. </p><p class="double">&quot;That night, ah made a vow. Ah would remember that changeling. Maybe what ah did was necessary. Maybe it wasn&#039;t. Didn&#039;t make it right. From that day forward, ah promised mahself ah would never be proud of what ah had done, whether ah did it again or not.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Ah know it&#039;s not the same, but ah figure hearing about somepony else&#039;s problem&#039;d help get your mind of yours.&quot; </p><p class="double">Twilight spread a thin smile. It had no teeth, just a lip-quirk of appreciation. </p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re right. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s quite the same, but thank you. It&#039;s the thought that counts.&quot; </p><p class="double">The silence stretched on from there, but it was a different silence. Both Twilight and Macintosh watched the alcohol swirl in the glass between their ciders. A meditative scene. Two Loopers sharing a moment to contemplate their actions in the company of someone who understood, at least a bit. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='39'></a><h3>Loops 37</h3>
<p>37.1 – Bobnik</p><p class="double">Princess Luna stood on the deck of her new ship, and watched as it tacked neatly about Equis and her sister&#039;s sun under the expert hooves of Twilight Sparkle. She marvelled at the view, the crisp clarity of the vacuum combined with the lack of any visible barrier to keep the air in. She turned her head upwards, and saw the patterns of light flow across the sails into the mast and down into the engines below.</p><p class="double">&quot;I assume it&#039;s some manner of force field holding the atmosphere?&quot; she asked the helmsmare.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. The inspiration came from a pretty weird loop though. In that universe, all of space had an atmosphere and an <i>ecosystem</i>. Strange, but very pretty. I hope you get the chance to see it.&quot; replied Twilight.</p><p class="double">Luna sighed. &quot;I hope I do too. The ride is so smooth, is the wind from the Sun normally so constant?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, but I challenged Rainbow Dash to control the solar weather over the entire surface of the Sun, all at once. This is for training, you&#039;ll have to get used to the chop later. Speaking of which, you&#039;re up, Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight moved aside and let Luna take the wheel. The Princess of the Night lit her horn and took active control of the helm. &quot;Celly has her surfboard, but I think I prefer this. For the moment at least, I&#039;ve had enough of being alone.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you hear that, you lollygaggers?&quot; yelled Twilight at the crew. Most of the local loopers were along for the ride, as well as a few specially selected guests. &quot;Your Princess actually likes your company! Look lively there, and trim the foresail! Lookout, are the skies clear?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Clear as a bell, Ms Sparkle!&quot; called back Pipsqueak from the crow&#039;s nest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then what course, Captain?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna straightened, the flowing of her mane in the ethereal winds matching the billowing sails above. She remembered a phrase from a loop that Pinkie (and apparently Gummy) had been in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Second star to the left, and straight on &#039;til morning.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.2 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p>X-COM loop</p><p class="double">Twilight came awake (with a small &#039;a&#039;) instantly as her proximity alarm spell went off. A Skyranger was incoming, which meant she should be going. Hopping out of bed, a quick brush spell and a bit of telekinesis and she was kitted out and ready to go. But first she had to keep her promise. She threw a scrying spell out to check where she was going, and went in a flash of teleportation.</p><p class="double">Kimiko was back on the front desk. Manager Urashima had offered to let her go off shift early to recover, but she&#039;d insisted on staying the course. Besides, she wanted to be there to say goodbye to Twilight. It was almost the end of her shift anyway, and certainly a quiet time in the lobby, so she wasn&#039;t exactly stressed. She pulled up the posted video and grinned to see the views were in the tens of thousands already. Let those awful military types try to hush that up!</p><p class="double">When she looked up Twilight was there. &quot;Just wanted to say goodbye. An X-Com team is almost here, and considering I&#039;m probably still top of their &#039;capture or kill&#039; list, best not to give them the chance.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kimiko came out from behind the desk and knelt down in front of her, offering a hug. &quot;I understand. When I think of what they did to you I get so mad...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight leant into the hug and returned it with a fore-leg over Kimiko&#039;s shoulder. &quot;It&#039;s okay, don&#039;t be too hard on them. You saw the sort of things they&#039;ve been fighting. Did they over-react in my case? Yes. Can I honestly blame them? Not so much. Those soldiers who are coming here put themselves in danger to protect people like you from those invaders on a daily basis, and I can respect that, even honour it. My big brother&#039;s a Royal Guard so I understands where they&#039;re coming from. However, that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m going to stick around and act as their target dummy. But I won&#039;t prank them, they&#039;re just following orders.&quot;</p><p class="double">She released the hug naturally, and stepped back. &quot;My issue is with their leaders, who seem to shell-shocked too adapt to changing circumstances. Still the best revenge is living well, and I intend to do just that while helping people out wherever I can. Just because they&#039;re going to be jerks doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m going to join them. You&#039;d better get back to your desk, they&#039;re on final approach.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she sat back down, she felt a slight warmth and tingle from the pocket where she&#039;d put the gemstone Twilight had given her, and saw the alicorn&#039;s horn glow gently. &quot;What&#039;s that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The stuff that dreams are made of.&quot; Twilight replied, grinning. &quot;Call it a good luck charm.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a roaring from outside in the half empty car park. &quot;Thank you, for everything, and farewell.&quot;</p><p class="double">She vanished in a flash of light just as the sound of jets died.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Operation Bring Night.</p><p class="double">Mission Brief.</p><p class="double">Site is isolated hot springss resort in Gifu province of Japan.

There&#039;s also a strong possibility that Target Sparkle is on the scene, possibly as a lead element.</p><p class="double">Mission Objectives</p><p class="double">Assess situation at site.</p><p class="double">Capture or destroy Target Sparkle if present.</p><p class="double">Destroy all other extraterrestrials on site.</p><p class="double">Rescue any survivors.</p><p class="double">Additional</p><p class="double">Use of portable Psionic Damper has been approved. Use it to suppress Target Sparkle&#039;s abilities. Attempt capture only if there is no significant resistance, otherwise destroy it. This objective has priority over all others.&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lieutenant Suchiro Saname was the low man on the totem pole in team two, and the only native Japanese speaker. Combined with the fact that he was an assault specialist, trained to get up in an alien&#039;s face and blow it out the back of their head with his alloy cannon, it made him the obvious point man for this operation. As he approached the front doors of the hot springs, he checked the parking area. For a place that had supposedly been wrecked by aliens, it looked surprisingly intact, but the aliens had been approaching from the far side, where the actual baths were. </p><p class="double">The rest of the team spread to search the area, Major &#039;Ramrod&#039; Wallace, the team leader and sniper was behind him, covering his approach. He hadn&#039;t lit off his thrusters to take aerial overwatch, and probably wouldn&#039;t until they had something to fire at. Suchiro dashed forward to take cover behind one of the door lintels, and waited for the rest of the team to reach position before entering. Captain Irwin Goldfarb, one of the team&#039;s two Heavy Weapons specialists came up and pressed himself flat against the other lintel. In place of his normal heavy plasma cannon, he carried the newly built mobile Psionic Supressor.</p><p class="double">Ramrod spoke in English over their comm system. &quot;Saname, this is Ramrod. I&#039;ve got overwatch. Take the door.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suchiro spun round in a practised motion and went through the double doors, shoving them back as he scanned the lobby interior. He didn&#039;t know what he expected to see, but a receptionist calmly sitting at a desk wasn&#039;t it.</p><p class="double">She also didn&#039;t seem to be phased by a guy in plated body armour crashing therough the door, gun in hand. &quot;Good evening sir. I&#039;m afraid the sentai fan convention was last week. Do you have a booking?&quot; Kimiko might be willing to forgive these guys if Twilight so obviously had, but that didn&#039;t mean she wasn&#039;t going to have a bit of fun of her own.</p><p class="double">The soldier put up his gun and spoke in English, &quot;Lobby is clear sir. In fact, it looks like nothing&#039;s happened. The receptionist is still at her desk, and making jokes! I&#039;m going to talk to her.&quot; He turned his attention directly to her and replied. &quot;I&#039;m not here for the baths, miss. We had a report of... hostile activity. Have you seen or heard anything unusual?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you mean that group of aliens that attacked us, what&#039;s left is by the recycling bins around the side of the building, along with the other rubbish.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT!&quot; Suchiro&#039;s exclamation brought an immediate response. Goldfarb barreled in, side-arm out and free hand on the trigger for the Psionic Supressor. He might not know much Japanese, but he was enough of an anime fan to understand the loudly shouted, &quot;NANI!&quot; </p><p class="double">Kimiko kept her seat, and her composure. &quot;Do you need a double room, or two singles?&quot; Suchiro finally got his brain back in gear and called over the comm, once again in English, to silence the chatter.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is Suchiro, I&#039;m fine, everything&#039;s fine. The receptionist just claimed that the alien attack has been defeated, and the remains are around by the service area. I&#039;ll try and find out more.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kimiko&#039;s English was Japanese high school level, and had never been her strongest subject, however she understood the sentence perfectly. She tried to frame a comment in English, and found the words coming to her as easily as Japanese. &quot;I am right here, you know. The aliens came, Miss Twilight put up a shield over the Hot Springs and went out to fight them. She beat them like a Taiko drum, and Manager Urashinma had what was left put outside for collection.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight? A purple pony with wings and a horn?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now you come to mention it...&quot; Kimiko nodded, pretending to think deeply. &quot;Yes, yes she was.&quot;</p><p class="double">She noticed the way the two soldiers tightened their grips on their weapons. Suchiro continued to speak for them.</p><p class="double">&quot;So she was here? Where is she now? It&#039;s vitally important that we find her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She left just before you got here.&quot; Kimiko replied, her voice hardening. &quot;It seems she didn&#039;t want to give you another chance to shoot at her.&quot; That got them to look down and loosen their grips, looking slightly shame-faced.</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t understand Miss...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Kimiko Mizuno.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Miss Mizuno. I&#039;m Leiutenant Saname, Special Forces. She may look harmless, even cute, but she is a powerful and dangerous alien creature. We need to recapture her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is that what the pachinko machine your friend is carrying is for? To distract her while you sneak upon her?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not a...&quot; Suchiro glanced at the device Goldfarb was carrying, and found it had been replaced with a pachinko machine. Goldfarb unslung it, and a note fluttered off it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear X-Com soldiers. Don&#039;t worry, the real device is back in the Skyranger. I had said to Kimiko I wouldn&#039;t prank you, but I couldn&#039;t help myself when I saw that. A Psionic Suppressor? Really? That didn&#039;t stop me last time, so why did anyone think it would work this time? I can see this is more powerful, like a strobe rather than a searchlight, but it wouldn&#039;t work on me any more than the other one in my current form. I understand the technology at least as well as Doctor Vahlen (unsurprising, as it was her memories I copied) and I can assure you it&#039;s about as much use against my powers as that gambling machine.</p><p class="double">&quot;I bear no ill will towards the team that captured me, they were only doing their duty as they saw it, and I&#039;m even willing to make peace with your top brass. Tell Doctor Vahlen I apologise for copying her memories, but I needed information in a hurry, and unlike her method, her brain didn&#039;t need to be peeled like an onion, and chopped and fried like one at the same time. However, matching her knowledge of the aliens and their technology with my own of magic has brought up some surprising insights. I&#039;d be perfectly willing to give her them, and some of my memories of Equestria and my magical research in return as an apology. Yours, Twilight Sparkle.&#039; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u>Operation Bring Night - After Action Report</u></p><p class="double"><b>Mission Status</b></p><p class="double">Objective 1 - Complete</p><p class="double">Objective 2 - Failed</p><p class="double">Objective 3 - Complete (13 kills?)</p><p class="double">Objective 4 - Complete (0 casualties)</p><p class="double"><b>Team Status</b></p><p class="double">Major James &#039;Ramrod&#039; Wallace (UK, Sniper, 51 kills, 43 Missions) - Active</p><p class="double">Captain Astrid &#039;Valkyrie&#039; Bergstrom (Sweden , Heavy, 36 kills, 40 Missions) - Active</p><p class="double">Captain Jaques &#039;Backstop&#039; La Fourette (France, Support, 38 Kills, 33 Missions) - Active</p><p class="double">Captain Irwin Goldfarb (Israel, Heavy, 27 kills, 25 Missions) - Active</p><p class="double">Lieutenant Namara Macrae (USA, Support, 24 kills, 25 Missions) - Active</p><p class="double">Lieutenant Saname Suchiro (Japan, Assault, 26 kills, 12 Missions) - Active</p><p class="double"><b>Alien Artifacts Recovered</b></p><p class="double">Floater Corpse x1</p><p class="double">Floater Corpse (Damaged) x1</p><p class="double">Sectopod Corpse x1</p><p class="double">Chrysalid Corpse (damaged) x1</p><p class="double">Potted plants? x8</p><p class="double">Shaped Helium Balloon x1</p><p class="double">Plasma Pistols x3</p><p class="double">Heavy Plasma Rifles x2</p><p class="double">Gold coins x3</p><p class="double">Pachinko Machine x1</p><p class="double"><b>Notes</b></p><p class="double">Witness testimony relates that Target Sparkle (See Project REDACTED) engaged the other aliens before X-Com could respond. Video footage confirms this, and demonstrates Target Sparkle has a number of extra-normal abilities beyond those demonstrated during REDACTED. The uncertainties in kill totals and aliens recovered come from one of these, where the target appeared to transmute aliens into potted plants and in one case a helium balloon. </p><p class="double">Preliminary examination of genetic data shows the plants to have close similarities in form to terrestrial plants, but no exact matches. The possibility exists that the target was merely using it&#039;s teleportation ability to exchange them, and place them in a holding area for further use, but no confirmation can be had. It has further been suggested that the entire attack was staged by Sparkle in order to appear heroic, heretoafter referred to as the Trojan Horse Hypothesis, but that can not be confirmed or denied at this time.</p><p class="double">Other abilities demonstrated included gross telekinesis in the tons range, manipulation of inter-molecular forces, energy projection and manipulation ability on the order of fighter mounted weapons, high degrees of kinesthesia and situational awareness and tactical skill. Target claimed some or all of these abilities came from it&#039;s studies of &#039;magic&#039; and &#039;redeveloping an ancient unicorn martial art&#039;. Target&#039;s threat level has been increased to Extreme Plus, a new threat level promulgated specifically for the target.</p><p class="double">Specific abilities to study include the manifestation of an energy-based weapon that was used as a melee weapon, changing to act as a sword, staff and lance at various times, and was capable of deflecting plasma fire. Any personnel using the term &#039;Poni Knight&#039; to describe this will be subject to 10 days detention and loss of privileges.</p><p class="double">Subject also created an indigo force field dome that covered an area of several thousand square metres and was recorded blocking multiple blasts from a Sectoid&#039;s primary weapons, but from witness reports was selectively permeable to matter. Duplication of this effect has alpha priority.</p><p class="double">Subject has been described as using a &#039;perimeter alarm spell&#039; to detect the approach of the aliens and the X-Com team. Whether it was true or not for the aliens (see Trojan Horse Hypothesis) it is evident that Target Sparkle became aware of the approaching team at a range of dozens of miles. The methodology of this effect is unclear, but it suggests that Target Sparkle will have advance warning of any overt move against it.</p><p class="double">The gold coins recovered from the site are artefacts left by Target Sparkle in payment for the services of the Omachi Hot Springs. A separate analysis of these artefacts is under way under the project title &#039;Cortez&#039;. Remuneration for the confiscated artefacts is strongly suggested to obtain continued assistance of locals. Invoice Cortez 0003 has been sent to REDACTED. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am only going to ask this once. I want a reasonable answer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Why are we cuttlefish?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have no idea.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.4 (Richardson)</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara wondered what unspeakable act she had committed to deserve such karma. It was her first loop &#039;outside&#039; of Equestria, and judging from the pitying looks everypon- everybody kept giving her, it would be a &#039;doozy&#039; to use Pinkie&#039;s colorful commentary. She was in some kind of loop where ponies had fled to another world to escape some catastrophe on Equestria, ending up on another planet that sounded a lot like the &#039;hub&#039; world she had been told of. They had joined forces with the local humans to form a grand Earth Alliance that had taken to the stars.</p><p class="double">A pity her part in it wasn&#039;t so good. Since she had woken up, she had seen the local version of her father die, had been put through five different kinds of hell, especially by that annoying twit Mollari and the local loopers. She was replacing the normal second most common looper, one Cmdr. Ivonova, second in command of some kind of crazy diplomatic station called B5. Her best friend in the multiverse had been brainwashed and twisted by the really creepy local group known as the Psicorps. There was almost nothing left of the filly she used to love to hang out with.</p><p class="double">And she wasn&#039;t even allowed to smack somepon- somebody upside the head when they did something really, REALLY stupid and forced her to work overtime to fix it.</p><p class="double">Like right now. All the local loopers seemed to be running around trying to patch something up, too busy to even bother telling her what in Tartarus was going on, and here she was having to deal with a survey team that had somehow ticked off the supposedly dead planet below them. Yeah, right. Dead enough to launch enough missiles to blow a crater where Mt. Canter used to be. Ah, screw it. Screw decorum, screw playing her part as a good little officer. Screw being nice!</p><p class="double">&quot;And one other thing to contemplate on your way back here; the Babylon 5 Mantra.&quot; Tiara leaned onto the live microphone button, angling closer to the recorder. &quot;Lt. Tiara is Always Right. I will Listen to Tiara. Tiara is Next to Celestia. And, if this ever happens again, TIARA WILL PERSONALLY RIP YOUR LUNGS OUT!&quot; </p><p class="double">She looked around at the shocked expressions and crewmembers both leaning away from her and cowering behind their consoles. Was she... panting? Holy crap. Maybe a bit too much stress relief. She pulled herself away from where she had been hunched over, straightening her jacket as she hoped that the button hadn&#039;t broke. Gingerly, she tapped the microphone button again, speaking calmly. &quot;Have a nice day.&quot;</p><p class="double">Growling, she blew a stray lock of her mane out of her face as she wanted to cry. The slightest whisper of a thought brushed against the rather irritating new sense she had gained when she had arrived. Apparently, the looper she had replaced was a &#039;telepath&#039;. or at least a weak one. By the local scale, a P1, maybe a P2. Just enough to occasionally listen, not even enough to get into somebody&#039;s head. Ugh, another reason to hate the Psicorps, who made Twilight &#039;CLOCK! IS! TICKING!&#039; Sparkle look relatively sane. They would snatch her up in a second and brainwash her just like Silver Spoon had been if they found out.</p><p class="double">She turned to her fellow officer of the watch, who discretely covered his snickers with his hand. &quot;You have a problem with that, Corwin?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only that you didn&#039;t do it sooner, Ma&#039;am.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you saying I should start putting the fear of Tiara into the hearts of every man, woman, and filly on this station?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Respectfully, Ma&#039;am? Yes Ma&#039;am. It wouldn&#039;t be the same without it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great. I spend forever trying to forget how to be mean, and now people WANT me to be mean. What&#039;s next? Luna herself gracing CnC with her presence after a thousand years? At least the planet&#039;s not going to blow up on us or something else stupid like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uhhh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Damnit.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.5 (FanOfMostEverything):</p><p class="double">Twilight came to a halt in the doorway of the bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;Close th&#039; door, please,&quot; Big Mac said gently. &quot;Don&#039; want flies in here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;R-right...&quot; Was this a prank? Nopony else was here, so there were no expressions to gauge but Macintosh&#039;s own intense, focused serenity. It also meant that Twilight was the only one to address the elephant in the room. &quot;Is that a...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">If Twilight hadn&#039;t needed a drink before, she certainly did now. &quot;<i>How!?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Funny ol&#039; fella showed me this trick.&quot; Big Mac stuck his tongue out a bit as he arranged a tiny pile of scree on the north face of his bonsai mountain. &quot;More t&#039; earth pony magic than helpin&#039; plants grow, y&#039;know.&quot; He blinked, then looked up from his work. &quot;Ah&#039;m sorry, Ah&#039;m bein&#039; awful rude. What kin Ah get ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight collapsed onto a barstool, eyes still locked on the tiny peak. &quot;Whatever will make this make sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion considered this for a moment. &quot;Ah&#039;ll go find that one batch Trixie helped me make.&quot; A beat. &quot;An&#039; some tongs.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.6 (Masterweaver):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh are you so sure about that?&quot; Trixie challenged with a smirk, smacking down a card. &quot;Well, I spent my Ice Cream Truck profits on a walrus!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. &quot;Welp, there goes my west fort.&quot; A feral smile formed on her face as she slid a card out from under her miniature. &quot;Shame, too, it was guarding the Breakout Character.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? No!&quot; The unicorn looked the board over in dismay. &quot;The walrus can&#039;t be my flagship, not this late in the game!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aaaaand now it&#039;s my turn.&quot; With a flourish, on final card was placed in front of the pegasus. &quot;Musical number! All those who don&#039;t participate get deported.... oh, look at that, Walruses don&#039;t dance. Who would have thunk it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie shook her head and leaned back, dropping her cards with a sigh and a smile. &quot;Well well well. Good game, Chrysy. I have to admit, I thought I had it in the bag after I took out your Tome of Eldritch Lore, but....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord is a devious game designer...&quot; The pony across from her flipped her mane. &quot;And I am a devious game player. It&#039;s only natural I should <i>oh no he&#039;s here just act natural.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave her a look of confusion before glancing at the coffee shop entrance. Shining Armor was walking in, humming to himself as he trotted up to the counter. Trixie turned back to her date with a half amused grin. &quot;Oh fine, I won&#039;t let your old flame see you--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He doesn&#039;t know I&#039;m looping!&quot; Chrysalis hissed. &quot;I don&#039;t even know if he knows about the slave loop and... just, please, don&#039;t tell him!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait... he doesn&#039;t know?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis slumped in her seat. &quot;I... it&#039;s not him, but... it looks like him and... I don&#039;t know, I just can&#039;t. Please, Trixie, don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie?&quot; Shining Armor walked up. &quot;Wow. Small world! And who&#039;s your friend?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This? This is... Crys<i>tal</i> Shard.&quot; Trixie laughed. &quot;Yeah, she saw one of my shows and couldn&#039;t get enough of me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...m&#039;llo,&quot; mumbled the pegasus.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there!&quot; The captain of the guard gave her a gentle smile. &quot;Don&#039;t let me intimidate you. Just a servant of the country.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...m&#039;kay.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining gave her an odd look. &quot;...okay then.... Trixie, sorry for interrupting. I didn&#039;t realize you were on a date!&quot; The stallion nodded politely before taking his coffee and trotting out.</p><p class="double">Trixie took a breath, counting quietly as she refocused her mind.</p><p class="double">Then she glared at Chrysalis. &quot;Why didn&#039;t you tell me you never broke up with him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It – It&#039;s not him I-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh.” Trixie waved a hoof. “You know what I mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus wilted. &quot;I... I just... I can&#039;t. It was eighteen years, from my perspective. Eighteen whole years, and, and that was before I knew about the loops...&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I... I want to move on, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed, her anger melting away. &quot;I see... You&#039;re going to have to deal with this eventually you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know. I just--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. No excuses.&quot; The unicorn looked away. &quot;I put on the Alicorn Amulet because of excuses. The first time, anyway. Just... if you want, I&#039;ll be there, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you. Twilight said she&#039;d be there too, but...&quot; Chrysalis smiled. &quot;I... would feel better if someone who <i>wasn&#039;t</i> at the wedding was there too. Just... not right now...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.7 (Misterq):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike looked at his body. Purple coat and horn, lime green mane and tail. That meant one thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m a pony this loop!&quot; the new unicorn colt exclaimed, &quot;Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">As the former dragon raced out of the library, he missed several details. The books were all very large and shelved on elegantly carved marble shelves. The piles of gems, meticulously sorted by size, shape, clarity, etc.. The fact that the entrance way was a series of magical barriers in a cavern-like hall.</p><p class="double">All these details came rushing back to him as he stood on the baloney-like ledge overlooking a series of crags and rocky spires. And there was Twilight and her friends. In the air. As giant dragons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on!&quot; Spike shouted as the memories integrated. He was still Twilight&#039;s helper, but now every pony was a dragon. Twilight and him lived in the town of Dragonville.</p><p class="double">Rairty was still white and very elegant in her dragon form. Twilight was still very recognizable as a relatively smallish purple scaled dragon. Rainbow Dash was a sleek looking flyer, the colour of a cloudless sky with rainbow-colored spikes. Applejack was an orange muscular dragon who would be a nightmare to battle. Fluttershy was busy hyperventilating, and Pinkie Pie was...</p><p class="double">Spike turned around slowly to stare into a wide grinning pink-scaled maw with far, far too many sharp pointy teeth in it.</p><p class="double">Yep. Pinkie Pie was still Pinkie Pie. On top of her head sat a small greenish goat - Gummy presumably.</p><p class="double">A shadow fell over everything. Spike looked up at the mind-bogglingly immense dragon body of Celestia as she gracefully glided in for a landing.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s it. If any dragon needs me, I&#039;ll be in the library,&quot; Spike said and turned around.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Spike,&quot; Rarity gently landed next to him, &quot;if memory serves correctly, most dragons in this loop have the ability to do one thing in particular.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, Rarity&#039;s body shrunk in on itself further and further until there stood Rarity, the unicorn. &quot;We can shapeshift.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike smiled. &quot;I can work with that.&quot; </p><p class="double">37.8 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. &quot;Pinkie, there is no Pink Lantern! Pink doesn&#039;t exist on the electromagnetic spectrum, it&#039;s basically negative green.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie just smiled. Not her usual lip-straining beam, but a content grin. &quot;Twilight, what do the various Lantern Corps channel, again?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn retrieved the notes she&#039;d prepared in the event of this Loop. &quot;Going in ROYGBIV order: anger, greed, fear, willpower, hope, compassion, and love.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded. &quot;Notice anything missing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it doesn&#039;t match Poll Ekmane&#039;s basic emotional classifications or Bobbin Plush&#039;s &#039;wheel of emotion.&#039; In fact, in Plush&#039;s model—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Happiness, Twilight. There&#039;s no happiness.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight did not pout. She was far too mature for such petulant displays. &quot;I was getting to that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie held the hoofring — more a bracelet, really — up to the lantern. Twilight couldn&#039;t help but think that it would probably seem a lot more momentous if the ring wasn&#039;t cheap plastic and the lantern wasn&#039;t an immense hard candy. Still, Pinkie recited the oath she&#039;d made up with utmost seriousness:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;For every sorrow large and small,</p><p>My laughter will bring joy to all.</p><p>As long as someone has a ball,</p><p>Pink Lantern&#039;s light will never fall!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Rosy light bathed the room. For about a minute afterwards, Twilight just sat in place, boggling at the floating mare. Pinkie bided her time by playing a pair of marionettes she made from coherent joy.</p><p class="double">Finally, Twilight got up and made for the door.</p><p class="double">Pinkie drifted alongside her. &quot;Where you going?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To find Discord. Then, if he isn&#039;t responsible for this, the bar.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.9</p><p class="double">Blinking, Twilight looked up from her book.</p><p class="double">At least for once – for <i>once!</i> – she&#039;d not woken up mid-stride. Pity she was human, though, those usually tended to be the more problematic loops.</p><p class="double">And, scanning her loop memories, this was no exception.</p><p class="double"><i>Right... that little problem can wait. Now, what&#039;s going on?</i></p><p class="double">There was a ceremony in progress... something about summoned familiars.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around surreptitiously, pulled out a PADD, slipped it into her book, and got to text searching as names firmed in her memory.</p><p class="double">Her own familiar waved to her, prompting her to check her loop memories again – which distracted her for a moment, since she was fairly sure the normal issue familiar for her here wasn&#039;t Saphira... but this was a public place, so there was no chance to double check.</p><p class="double">Well, she could get on quite well with Saphira. All things considered, it could have been worse.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Kyuui...” Irukuru&#039;s head drooped. “Sowwy, Ewagon. Iwukuwu didn&#039;t mean to.”</p><p class="double">Eragon looked at the hole in his roof, and sighed.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry. I&#039;ll get it fixed.”</p><p class="double">As he turned for the saw, the blue Rhyme dragon squee&#039;d and glomped him.</p><p class="double">A grin stole over the Rider&#039;s expression, as he disentangled himself carefully from Irukuru and headed out to chop some new timber.</p><p class="double">For some reason, he wasn&#039;t at all resentful towards the Replacement for his normal dragon. She was just like an over-excitable little sister...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Done.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight closed her book with a quiet twik, and began to pay more attention as the girl she&#039;d identified as the main character stepped up to the podium.</p><p class="double">Here was where it would all get interesting...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Louise swallowed, and began to speak, hoping against hope that for once – for once – she would get the spell right.</p><p class="double">&quot;I beg of you… My servant who lives somewhere in the universe! Oh sacred, beautiful and strong familiar spirit! I desire and here I plead from my heart! Answer to my guidance!&quot; </p><p class="double">Her wand sparked to life... then there was a loud bang.</p><p class="double">In other words, more or less normal for Louise&#039;s magic thus far.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight frowned through the smoke. Something seemed... familiar.</p><p class="double">Then she heard a voice. A very familiar voice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Who summons Trixie?”</p><p class="double">As the smoke cleared, Louise saw who was speaking.</p><p class="double">A moderately sized... blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">Louise sat back hard, suddenly filled with euphoria. She&#039;d done it! She&#039;d summoned a familiar! She...</p><p class="double">Wait.</p><p class="double">Did that unicorn just talk?</p><p class="double">And why is it wearing clothes?</p><p class="double">The unicorn turned to her with a graceful movement, sending her cloak sweeping out in an impressively billowy arc, and looked her up and down.</p><p class="double">“Hm. Trixie supposes you may do.”</p><p class="double">“Aherm,” Mr. Colbert interjected. “Miss Louise, you must complete the binding.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow as the binding completed. Mjöðvitnir?</p><p class="double">Well, at least it made a little more sense than to have Trixie wielding a sword.</p><p class="double">Though, if Derfflinger was going to be free this loop...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So.” Trixie looked her new... &#039;master&#039; up and down. (She had her own opinions on who the apprentice was and who the master was). “Your magic is?”</p><p class="double">Louise hung her head. “Not very good. Everything I try just makes an explosion.”</p><p class="double">Trixie stood bolt upright. “And that is <i>not good</i> by the standards of this land? These foals are fools!” Louise actually saw the faint stars gleaming in Trixie&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">Trotting over, Trixie laid a hoof on her shoulder. “Trixie will teach you the number one tenet of her philosophy. There is <i>nothing</i> that cannot be solved with a sufficiently large detonation.”</p><p class="double">Dubiously, Louise looked at her familiar. “You think so?”</p><p class="double">“Trixie has made machines that go into <i>space</i> based solely on how big the explosion inside them is!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as Saphira walked calmly off the stage. The now-a-diamond stage. “I didn&#039;t actually know you could do that.”</p><p class="double">Saphira shrugged, and bent down to whisper. “It took me Loops to work out how to do it consciously.”</p><p class="double">Sitting back, they watched the final pair of master and familiar come on stage for the talent show.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Twilight added, pulling out two pairs of sunglasses. “You might want these. I know Trixie&#039;s style.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The shower of fireworks, explosions, sound effects and even illusions was so complex that it took the faculty almost five minutes to notice that the school was being robbed by a giant rock monster with a mage on top.</p><p class="double">Of course, Trixie and Louise noticed at about the same time. And then the golem exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...ta-da?” Trixie said, uncertainly, as the bits of rock and earth stopped raining down.</p><p class="double">Then, getting back into the groove, she slammed her hooves on the stage. “We hope that you enjoyed the show – despite the unexpected intrusion by...?”</p><p class="double">“Foquet, the Crumbling Dirt,” Louise picked up on the conversation. “It looks like even master thieves can&#039;t handle us!”</p><p class="double">Trixie laughed. “<i>That</i> was a master thief? Where I come from, master thieves will add locks to doors if they did not consider the locks already there enough of a challenge!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight facepalmed.</p><p class="double">“What?” Saphira whispered.</p><p class="double">“<i>She&#039;s</i> the one who did that.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie walked slowly up the steps, and into the room where Guiche and his girlfriend were.</p><p class="double">“You. The herbalist.”</p><p class="double">Montmorcery looked up.</p><p class="double">“Fix this.” Trixie gestured back at her apprentice, who was clinging to her right rear leg and muttering something about fuzzy ponies.</p><p class="double">“Oh, so <i>that&#039;s</i> where the love potion went...” Montmorcery mused. “Sorry, no can do.”</p><p class="double">“Louise?” Trixie said calmly.</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Louise said, looking up.</p><p class="double">“It would make me happy if you did that to Montmorcery.”</p><p class="double">“What are you-aaagh!” THUMP.</p><p class="double">Surprisingly, having Louise be <i>her</i> problem instead of Trixie&#039;s made Montmorcery very cooperative indeed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Albion are invading!”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Trixie said loudly. “Twilight, we require your dragon.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked over. “For what? I <i>could</i> handle the air fleet by myself, you know...”</p><p class="double">“We require... a firing platform.” Trixie grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">That day went down in history as the Great Albion Turkey Shoot.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, to cut a very long story very short,” Trixie said, flicking absently at her singed hat, “it was the fault of the king next country over – Joseph, I think.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Are you two alright?”</p><p class="double">Trixie looked over at Louise. “We had to fight a giant robot. It was interesting.”</p><p class="double">Louise was still clutching her wand, in a grip that didn&#039;t look likely to slacken any time soon.</p><p class="double">“I still wonder how Eragon&#039;s doing...” Saphira said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Kitty!”</p><p class="double">“Please get off me,” the werecat leader muttered.</p><p class="double">“But you&#039;re so fuzzy!” Irukuru enthused.</p><p class="double">“I am so sorry,” Eragon said, sniggering. “She does this to everyone.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.10</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said, looking over the papers and artefacts in front of her. “Spike? I think we know what this Loop&#039;s &#039;thing&#039; is.”</p><p class="double">Spike walked in, balancing a fire ruby on his claw. “Oh?”</p><p class="double">“Basically, urban fantasy sort of thing. Werewolves, vampires, that sort of thing.”</p><p class="double">“Not... the Cullens?” Spike asked, shivering. “Loops with them in are never nice.”</p><p class="double">“No, no sign of them.” Twilight sighed. “The bad side of that is that it&#039;s likely at least one of our friends is one or another of them.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that is bad,” Spike agreed. “Let&#039;s hope we can get this done without too much bloodshed.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“It came in the window!” Daisy said, shivering. “A great big furry monster!”</p><p class="double">“<i>We</i> have fur, Daisy,” Twilight pointed out, taking notes. “It&#039;s just called a coat. Anyway, you were saying?”</p><p class="double">“It opened the window, climbed in, and took one of my flower arrangements!”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s pen paused. “It did what?”</p><p class="double">She looked over to the window. “Huh. So it actually reached in and opened it, rather than breaking the glass?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Daisy gulped. “And then it picked up one of my flower arrangements in those huge, fanged jaws, dropped something, and jumped out the window again!”</p><p class="double">Spike held up a small drawstring bag. “Was it this?”</p><p class="double">“...yes, it must be. I don&#039;t recognize it.”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s about five bits in here,” Spike reported, opening the bag carefully.</p><p class="double">“So, we have a werewolf who opens the window, takes a flower arrangement, and pays for it...” Twilight summarized. “I may know the solution.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How did you find me?” Fluttershy asked, covering her face with her wings.</p><p class="double">“Actually, it was pretty obvious...” Twilight said, shrugging. Though she had no intention of actually <i>explaining</i> her reasoning, given that Fluttershy wasn&#039;t awake, and &#039;another version of you likes to turn into a wolf&#039; would sound just a little bit insane.</p><p class="double">“I swear I ask before I drain them...” the pegasus muttered.</p><p class="double">“Wait, back up.” Twilight blinked. “You&#039;re the <i>vampire?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Fluttershy hunched over again. “I only go out on cloudy days, and because I have animal friends I can ask them for donations... Dash knows, she helps provide clouds when I need them...”</p><p class="double">“Well, don&#039;t I feel silly,” Twilight said in an aside to Spike, who shrugged.</p><p class="double">“So,” Spike said, frowning. “Who&#039;s the werewolf?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Whew,” Dash said, shaking her head. “That&#039;s pretty risky...”</p><p class="double">“I paid for it!” Scootaloo said indignantly. “People are nice if you pay for things!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but usually you buy them normally, not break in and leave money...” Dash touched the hyacinths, now sitting on her worktop. “I get that you wanted to be nice, but I wouldn&#039;t have needed to be bribed, Scoots.”</p><p class="double">“It wasn&#039;t a bribe...” Scootaloo said quietly. “I just wanted you to like me.”</p><p class="double">“Already do, squirt.” Dash walked over and laid a wing on the back of the pegasus filly. “But, wow, I&#039;m turning into some kind of secret-supernatural-pony-hiding-mare...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">37.11 (Nighzmarquls)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was obvious from the very instant Twilight Sparkle Awakened that this was turning out to be an odd one.

Of course, the job had some fringe benefits, such as hearty home cooked meals, and access to Apple Bloom&#039;s workshop. They were unaware that both she and Applejack were loopers, or that loops existed, but they knew a good thing when they saw it, and Apple Bloom&#039;s magitek inventions were far beyond anything they&#039;d ever come up with.</p><p class="double">The little filly had been friendly enough, but they&#039;d quickly learned she had a will of adamantine. Continued access to her lab, and the &#039;computer&#039; with all her ideas and information on had been dependant on doing a good job at the grunt work Applejack had set them. She&#039;d also forestalled any midnight expeditions by demonstrating that all the workshop&#039;s systems and access routes responded only to her. As a result they&#039;d been forced to stay true to their word, and found to their surprise that it wasn&#039;t all bad.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom might have been more knowledgeable than them in many areas (not to mention being able to kick both their plots together from what they&#039;d seen of her practising her martial arts) but she&#039;d also been willing, even eager to learn what they had to teach. As often happened, teaching what they knew had given them new insights, and ultimately they had managed to work out a way to replace unicorn magic with earth pony magic in her inventions. They&#039;d both been surprised to find out how good it had made them feel.</p><p class="double">However, they&#039;d put in their time, and now had a big trailer cart hitched to the back of the SSCS 6000, filled with some of Sweet Apple Acres finest. The machine itself had been rebuilt, sleeker and slightly larger. They hadn&#039;t even had to trick Apple Bloom into doing that, she&#039;d freely offered to help with the reconstruction and put the resources of her workshop to the effort. It was now as reliable as any device could be, and the thaumic boiler system had been redesigned to be self-sustaining, requiring only an initial zap of magic to activate it. Apple Bloom had also insisted on making a few additions of her own.</p><p class="double">The two brother stood in front of the machine, looking less lanky than they had when they&#039;d arrived. Days of farmwork and good solid farm cooking had added muscle to their limbs and a few inches to their waistlines. Applejack, at the head of the Apples grouped there to see them off, spoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I wasn&#039;t too sure about doin&#039; this in ther first place, but the two of you haven&#039;t stinted yourselves. Apple Bloom gives you a good report too, and reckons that contraption can put out cider worthy of the Sweet Apple Acres name. So, like I agreed to start with, you can sell under our brand, as long as you keep things honest.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gave them a stern look from under her hat brim. &quot;And trust me, we will know if you use cut quality or try to con your customers, there are Apples everywhere from Manehatten to Appleoosa. On the other hoof, they should be able to supply you with more apples when those run out. Playing fair and square may not make you money as fast as cheating, but it&#039;ll give you more over the long run.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry ma&#039;am,&quot; Flim said, &quot;We didn&#039;t have much of a choice when we first turned up here. Now we do, and the last thing either of us wants is to end up back where we started. Miss Apple Bloom, I hope we can keep corresponding. I have some other ideas that could use your input.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned at the respectful tone. &quot;Works both ways. I can always use a second opinion on some of my inventions. I hope you like what I&#039;ve done to the 6000?&quot;</p><p class="double">Flam had already climbed up into the steering sofa. &quot;We surely do! I can&#039;t wait to try it out in the open air!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack looked back and forth between them. &quot;Hey, what&#039;s this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom replied, &quot;Just something I came up with as a bonus for helping me work out how to use earth pony magic instead of unicorn magic in my inventions. It seemed a good way to test what I&#039;d learned.&quot;</p><p class="double">Flim climbed up alongside his brother. &quot;And we&#039;re glad to have helped. Okay brother, time to go!&quot;</p><p class="double">He plugged his horn into a socket on the control panel and fired a burst of magic into it before removing it bringing his head back up. &quot;Okay, thaumic boiler is running up to operating pressure... Ready Flim?&quot;</p><p class="double">Flim pulled a lever and there was a shrill whistle. &quot;Ready Flam!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa!&quot; Applejack called out. &quot;Y&#039;all just be careful backing up! You&#039;ll need some-pony to help guide you back out onto the road to Canterlot!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them grinned at each other, their horns glowed, and a pair of mirror shades appeared on each of them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where we&#039;re going...&quot; Flim started, and Flam finished, &quot;... we don&#039;t <i>need</i> roads.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 lurched gently and rose into the air along with the trailer as wheels folded up underneath it, glowing with levitation rune-sets. It glided forward and up, turning to get a clear run above the apple trees, then the vents at the back glowed with a flare of rainbow flame and it shot off into the sky with a cheery whistle. </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Took a while, but...” Sweetie shrugged. “Like I say, it&#039;s cool of you.”</p><p class="double"><i>Think nothing of it. It was an interesting little exercise.</i></p><p class="double">“Right. Anyway, I think I&#039;ve got an idea...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo walked around the... <i>thing</i>. “Sweets... what <i>is</i> that?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie looked over, with affected casualness. “Oh, that&#039;s mine. It&#039;s what&#039;s called a bicycle.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus filly looked dubious. “How do you use it?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it&#039;s sort of like a scooter...” Sweetie slipped her right forehoof into one of the grip loops. “You have to have a kinda strange posture when using it, but it&#039;s really fast!”</p><p class="double">“Okay, this I gotta see.” Scootaloo unhooked her scooter from the cart they often used. “Betcha can&#039;t beat me!”</p><p class="double">Sweetie just smiled, slipping the other forehoof in and latching one of her hind legs to a pedal. “Ready when you are.”</p><p class="double">“ThreetwooneGO!” Scootaloo rattled off, and kicked – hard.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Thirty seconds in, Scootaloo felt quite good about the impromptu race.</p><p class="double">No way was Sweetie going to beat <i>her</i> at what she was best at!</p><p class="double"><i>Ring Cycle.</i></p><p class="double">“Eh?” Scootaloo risked a glance back. That hadn&#039;t sounded like Sweetie&#039;s voice...</p><p class="double">Then what <i>was</i> Sweetie&#039;s voice rose above the rattle of wheels, singing something in a language Scootaloo didn&#039;t know.</p><p class="double">And where was the musical accompaniment coming from?</p><p class="double">Then Sweetie blew past her in a rush of wind, still singing and with the wheels of her... <i>bicycle...</i> blazing a bright gold that almost hurt to look at.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You cheated!” Scootaloo accused, as she skidded to a halt outside the Carousel Botique. “That had to be magic!”</p><p class="double">Then she blinked. “Wait, where&#039;d the bicycle go?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie lowered a silver flute from her mouth. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d it go?”</p><p class="double">“I put it away.” Sweetie grinned. “Though, yeah, it did use magic. So does this.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo looked at the flute, still panting. “A magic flute?”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” The unicorn giggled.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t get it...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.2</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Sir,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I hope that this letter finds you well.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Actually, I don&#039;t really. But it&#039;s a polite thing to write nevertheless. I simply make this clarifying remark in case you come to the wrong conclusion from the first remark.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I have, over the last few months, been a profligate spender on the products of your establishment. The variety of your product line, and the speed of delivery of your experienced delivery staff, know no equal.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Sadly, the user friendliness of your products does not live up to the same standard. In fact, the user friendliness, ease of use, and quality of the purchases I have made from your company are all so very low that they compare unfavourably to having one&#039;s hoof shut repeatedly in a drawer. Which is on fire. And full of rabid, flesh-seeking weasels.</i></p><p class="double"><i>To this end, I wish to inform you that I will be filing paperwork on the morrow to attempt to gain compensation from you and your company for the many burns, contusions, lacerations, blunt trauma, sharp trauma, general maiming, and sheer embarrassment brought about by my use of the products you supply.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I hope to see you in court,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Trixie Lulamoon.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">“Look, Trixie,” Twilight said, as she finished taking the dictation. “Nobody <i>ever</i> catches him.” A thought struck her. “And why do you want to anyway?”</p><p class="double">“The challenge!” Trixie announced from her hospital bed. “Now, put the address of Acme Corporation on the envelope and send it! Then get to drawing up the court case.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re still not going to leave it?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">A dark blue blur shot into the room, paused, selected a book from the nearest bookshelf and shot off with a cry of &#039;Meep meep!&#039;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared for a moment.</p><p class="double">“Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight?” Trixie replied, with a hint of triumph.</p><p class="double">“I am sorry I ever doubted you. That road runner needs to go <i>down.</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.3 (Bobnik)</p><p class="double">The door of Big Mac&#039;s bar slammed open, and an agitated alicorn came through it.</p><p class="double">“Hoofrot, poxes and mange upon budget meetings! May the inventor of the committee rest unquiet in Blessed Lands forevermore!” cried Princess Luna.</p><p class="double">Celestia came through the door behind her sister, and while she was quiet and seemingly serene, Big Mac could tell she was as upset as Luna. It had taken him a long time to get over his own awe and learn to read the Sun Princess, but her eyes were empty, not just calm, a sure sign she had locked her emotions inside herself.</p><p class="double">Luna stomped up to the bar. “Sir Macintosh, please, give us a beverage from far beyond. Something new and different to chase away the memory of tax proposals we have heard a thousand times and more.”</p><p class="double">“It is rather trying, but we can&#039;t get in the habit of just ignoring them all the time,” said Celestia, “but something fresh and different would be just the ticket.” She shuffled her hooves and sighed, replacing false calm with genuine weariness.</p><p class="double">“Ah know just the thing. Have seat, and I&#039;ll bring it out.” replied Mac.</p><p class="double">When he returned with a large bottle and two glasses, the sisters had taken up seats in a corner booth, side by side. The looping bartender put the glasses on the table, and carefully poured a measure into each one.</p><p class="double">“Rarity gave a couple of cases of this to me just a day ago, &#039;parently she picked it up when she was Queen of England for a loop. Supposed to be made by giants, haven&#039;t heard the whole story yet. Apart from the Bearers and Spike, you&#039;re the first to try it.” he said as he poured.</p><p class="double">The liquid was a pale transparent green, and the noise as it was poured indicated it was fizzy. It had a scent like summer just shading into autumn. Oddly, as it was poured, an opaque layer formed on the bottom of each glass.</p><p class="double">“Giants, you say? Perhaps &#039;twas Harry Potter&#039;s Loop?” asked Luna, as her horn glowed and the glass rose to her muzzle. “Up with novelty, and down with boredom!” The glasses clinked together and both sisters took a hefty slug from the large tumblers.</p><p class="double">The flavour was redolent with berries and cream, but had none of the texture of a dairy product, and the bubbles chased the flavour down the throat with remarkable speed. There was no burn of alcohol, but a faint tingle showed there was some manner of magic in the drink.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I do like that,” said Celestia. “Very refreshing, and it&#039;s chased the cobwebs right out of my head.” She raised the glass higher to peer at the liquid. “Why, the bubbles are moving downwards!”</p><p class="double">It was true. The layer at the bottom of the glass was actually a head of froth, and the fizz descended through the glass to meet it. As Luna began to shift uneasily in her seat, Celestia noticed that Big Mac had retreated behind the bar at speed. She knew a pony taking cover when she saw it.</p><p class="double">Before she could open her mouth to inquire, the natural consequence of the downward-moving bubbles hit both sisters simultaneously. The noise was indescribable, and so loud as to shake the building. Mac&#039;s wisdom in sheltering behind the bar became apparent as loose objects were hurled about the room like a tornado had been let loose inside.</p><p class="double">In short, the Diarchy of Equestria farted so hard it blew them out of their seats.</p><p class="double">Luna scramble d backwards off the table where she&#039;d been blown as Celestia staggered back across the floor. Both of them stared incredulously at the miraculously intact drinks, then at each other, and finally accusingly across the room at the bartender.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup, frobscottle will do that.” said Mac, as he shook his head to clear it. “Y&#039;all still bored?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed not!” cried Luna, as she swept up her glass once more. “A toast, to the Equestrian Revenue Department. May their anthem resound eternal!” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.4</p><p class="double">“Hey, Twilight?” Pinkie said, grinning.</p><p class="double">“I dread to answer... yes, Pinkie?”</p><p class="double">“I worked out how I&#039;m gonna beat Nightmare Moon!” The pink pony held up her Ring. “Oh, can you put that shield spell on me, though, &#039;cause I&#039;m not all that practised with this and I&#039;d prefer to find out I can&#039;t do a shield in a learn-from-this-and-keep-going way, not a whoops-back-to-the-loop-start way.”</p><p class="double">Twilight waited a moment, to be sure Pinkie was done with that sentence. “Yes. I&#039;m doing it for everypony, -ling, and so on... though it does of course count as points against you if the mountain gets too damaged.”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Pinkie concentrated, and the Ring flared, then settled back to her coat colour.</p><p class="double">“Wait...” Twilight pointed. “Did you just-”</p><p class="double">“One hundred percent recharge is go!” Pinkie winked. “I just need to think of yay-I-can-do-the-same-birthday-party-over-and-over!”</p><p class="double">After a long minute, Twilight threw up her hooves, staggered for a moment and dropped back down onto all fours. “You know what, fine. You invented it, so presumably you know how it works.”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Pinkie&#039;s grin flashed as bright as her Ring had.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...last forever!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie trotted in through the stage entrance. “Hiya moonbutt!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s expression was a sight to behold.</p><p class="double">“Insolence!” she shouted, turning, and lighting up a spell on her horn. “Give me one good reason I should not simply destroy you now, and spare myself further insult!”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm...” Pinkie rolled her eyes up, pondering, and tapped her chin with one hoof. “Nope, can&#039;t think of one.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon unleashed a bolt of black fire, which narrowly missed Pinkie and set the wall alight. “There will not be another warning shot, peasant.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “Oh, you know my family?”</p><p class="double">“...pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Momma Pie and Daddy Pie are certainly peasants – though, more of smallholders, I suppose, so I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the right term. But you must have met them, &#039;cause otherwise you wouldn&#039;t get it right?”</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s an... insult...” Nightmare Moon mumbled, then remembered herself. “Trouble me no more, and you <i>may</i> keep your life.”</p><p class="double">“Okie dokie!” Pinkie nodded. “Hey, Nimmie?”</p><p class="double">The dark alicorn had only just turned back to the rest of the town. Her eye was seen to twitch as she turned once more. “<i>What?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Think fast!”</p><p class="double">Something glowing pink shot out from behind Pinkie&#039;s back, and fired a blue globe at the floor.</p><p class="double">Then, with a <i>bwuum</i> noise, a two-meter diameter hole appeared in the stage. On the other side was space.</p><p class="double">And quite a lot of escaping air.</p><p class="double">And, within a second or two, Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">In both a literal and metaphorical sense, it was simply <i>not</i> her day.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie let the construct vanish, and it took the portal with it.</p><p class="double">“Ta-da!”</p><p class="double">In the crowd, Twilight shook her head with a wince. So, Pinkie could use her Ring to create a portal gun.</p><p class="double">That was going to be... interesting...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“<b>Cryyst-”</b></p><p class="double"><i>vwum</i></p><p class="double">Pinkie counted. “Four, five, six-”</p><p class="double"><b>“taaaaaals!”</b></p><p class="double"><i>vwum</i></p><p class="double">Twilight followed Sombra as he fell through the blue portal, then came sailing down through the air from the orange one hundreds of metres up.</p><p class="double">For about the fiftieth time.</p><p class="double">“How long are you going to keep doing that?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “Until it isn&#039;t funny any more.”</p><p class="double">“Is that by your judgement or mine?”</p><p class="double">“Theirs,” Pinkie replied, pointing to a number of Crystal Ponies.</p><p class="double">By now, some of them were making popcorn.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.5</p><p class="double">Fluttershy lay back in bed and sighed, an all-too-familiar melancholia stealing over her.</p><p class="double">A Fused Loop was over, and now it was back to Equestria.</p><p class="double">Nice, safe Equestria. Same old Equestria.</p><p class="double">Twilight had mentioned this to them, back after the first couple of fused loops. It was sometimes hard to maintain perspective after seeing the multiverse like that.</p><p class="double">They&#039;d gotten used to it, after a while. Friends helped – though Twilight often had loops alone, being an Anchor was awful sometimes – and so did the perspective that came with age.</p><p class="double">But sometimes... it was worse than normal. Sometimes she&#039;d lost close friends, so recently made. All Loopers prepared for the possibility, she&#039;d known it was coming, but...</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny cut into her mope by kicking her bed hard enough to leave a dent.</p><p class="double">“Naughty rabbit!” Fluttershy scolded, rolling off the mattress and giving him a tolerant look. “Keep that up and I&#039;ll make you dust the bookshelf!”</p><p class="double">The threat bounced off Angel&#039;s armour like a rubber ball. He shrugged and bounced off to... well, probably threaten a songbird or something.</p><p class="double">A moment&#039;s check on her Loop memories reassured Fluttershy that this Loop had begun at the normal time. That meant that the Summer Sun celebration was just around the corner.</p><p class="double">Now, was there a song she hadn&#039;t taught her bird friends?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The doorbell tinkled.</p><p class="double">“Come in,” Fluttershy called softly. “It&#039;s unlocked.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee pushed the door open, smiling. “Hello, Fluttershy. Sorry to intrude – I know you must be busy with the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it&#039;s no problem,” Fluttershy replied. “I was just making some tea. Would you like some?”</p><p class="double">The teacher frowned, considering it. “Maybe later.”</p><p class="double">“All right.” Nodding, Fluttershy put the kettle back on the stove, just to one side to keep it at the right temperature. “What brings you out here?”</p><p class="double">Now <i>that</i> was the real question. Cheerilee certainly never came out here in a normal loop, so...</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s quite a puzzle, actually,” Cheerilee admitted. “You see, there&#039;s a child who Nurse Redheart and I found wandering around Ponyville this morning. He seemed quite confused, but was insistent that he meet you.”</p><p class="double">She stepped fully into the cottage, and turned to the door. “Come on in, Lemon.”</p><p class="double">A bright yellow earth pony colt walked in, a little unsteady on his legs, and his eyes locked onto Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blinked, then gasped.</p><p class="double">“Leman?”</p><p class="double">“So you <i>do</i> know him?” Cheerilee asked, satisfied. “I&#039;ll want to hear all the details – but later. Can I leave you to take care of him for today? I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve got work to do for the festival as well.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s fine,” Fluttershy said absently.</p><p class="double">The moment Cheerilee was out of the house, she let her happiness off the leash. “Leman! I thought I&#039;d lost you.”</p><p class="double">She knelt down, spreading her forelegs, and the colt stumbled forward into her embrace.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on...” Lemon Rush said, looking around the cottage. “The last I remember, we were on Fenris.” Preparing for a delegation from the Light Eldar Empire to arrive, actually.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Fluttershy thought for a moment as she poured the tea. “Okay. There are things called time loops, and people from one sometimes end up in another. This is my home one.”</p><p class="double">“It certainly looks more peaceful than mine,” the colt said, glancing out the window. “And warmer.”</p><p class="double">He paused. “Didn&#039;t you used to have a horn, little mother?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, of course.” Fluttershy closed her eyes, let the Element of Kindness flash into being, and Ascended. “I forgot, you&#039;ve only seen me like this.”</p><p class="double">“Neat trick. Can we all do that?”</p><p class="double">“No, sorry.” Fluttershy shrugged, reverting the transformation. “It&#039;s... complicated. Come on, I&#039;ll introduce you to Twilight, and she can tell you what you need to know about the Loops.”</p><p class="double">“That works for me.” Rush stood up, and nearly fell over.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s hoof swept out to steady him, and he gratefully used it to stand back upright. “This is humiliating...” he muttered, face burning beneath his coat.</p><p class="double">“I had just as much trouble with walking on two legs,” Fluttershy smiled. “And with flying, actually. I still have a preference for walking where possible.”</p><p class="double">She nuzzled him affectionately. “It&#039;s good to see you, Leman.”</p><p class="double">“And you.” The normally-a-primarch laughed. “At least I didn&#039;t make <i>too</i> much of a mess when I arrived! If I&#039;d acted more like the Emperor would have then I&#039;d have thought this was some sorcerous trick!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy winced internally as she bumped into Gilda. Normally she was able to adroitly avoid the belligerent griffin, but she&#039;d just... forgotten. Too much else to think about.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Gilda said, scowling, and then roared.</p><p class="double">The roar was cut off within about a second, as two bright yellow hooves thudded into Gilda&#039;s torso. Air wooshed out in a strangled squawk, and the impact sent her beak over tail onto the road some distance away.</p><p class="double">“Let me make one thing clear,” Lemon said, sounding more predatory than the griffin he was standing on top of – in spite of his high-pitched colt&#039;s voice. “You can challenge anyone you like to a fight. I don&#039;t mind that. But you force a fight with someone who can&#039;t protect themselves, and you answer to me.”</p><p class="double">“Lemon!” Fluttershy said, sternly. “I know she&#039;s a bully, but that doesn&#039;t mean you can bully her back.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, little mother,” he said, shaking his head and stepping off Gilda. “I don&#039;t like seeing you hurt.”</p><p class="double">“I know you don&#039;t,” Fluttershy replied. “But still.”</p><p class="double">He nodded.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy bent down to talk more privately. “When did you learn to fight like that?”</p><p class="double">The colt smiled. “I&#039;m a <i>primarch.</i> We&#039;re <i>made</i> good at fighting.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">38.6</p><p class="double">“Sleipnir?”</p><p class="double">The horse deity turned from his keyboards. (Yes, keyboards. Eight legs is helpful if you can multi-task.) “Yeah, mom?”</p><p class="double">Loki winced. “Stop-”</p><p class="double">“-calling you that,” Sleipnir finished. “Did you expect that any of your children would lack a sense of humour? It&#039;s <i>hilarious</i> how you react.”</p><p class="double">Shaking his head, the trickster held up a hand. “A very good point. Though, speaking of my children, I&#039;ve got a... request, from Fenris.”</p><p class="double">It was Sleipnir&#039;s turn to wince. “I haven&#039;t forgotten when he chased me all around the room at his party.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re a horse, he&#039;s a wolf, it&#039;s natural.” Loki&#039;s grin was back on his face. “Anyway. One of the Loopers <i>he</i> keeps an eye on needs a break. Badly. Is there a slot in one of your worlds you can drop her into?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Sleipnir turned back to his computer, and started typing away. “There is one relatively controllable fused loop opportunity coming up for Equestria, so I can drop her into that when her next out-loop slot comes in.”</p><p class="double">“As soon as possible.” Loki paused. “Fenris is going to spend a <i>lot</i> of power on giving her this.”</p><p class="double">“Well, if it&#039;s that urgent...” Sleipnir tapped a few more controls. “There, done.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight...” Spike said, slowly reaching for his &#039;saber. “You might want to see this.”</p><p class="double">His tone of voice was warning enough. Twilight stepped quickly up to the window. “What?”</p><p class="double">All she could see was a fairly normal market day in Ponyville – the first following the Summer Sun celebration, true, so a little more nervous than normal, but nothing major.</p><p class="double">Spike pointed, indicating a pale blue earth pony mare. “Her.”</p><p class="double">Twilight squinted. “I still don&#039;t see it... is she a Looper?”</p><p class="double">“Must be. And not a local.” Spike shot a glance at Twilight, then his eyes widened. “Oh! Sorry, I keep forgetting you&#039;re not an empath.”</p><p class="double">“Just experience, that&#039;s all I have,” Twilight said with a shrug. “So, what is it?”</p><p class="double">“That mare is about a hoof-length short of snapping. The Force feels like... like lightning&#039;s about to strike.” Spike&#039;s expression clouded. “The last time it felt this bad was... well, suffice to say force psychosis was involved.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced, wondering if <i>he</i> had been the one involved. She knew Spike had had the occasional issue with control – every Looper had – but she hadn&#039;t pried. Courtesy.</p><p class="double">“So...” she mused. “What do we do?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Spike cracked his knuckles. “I&#039;m the one with battle precognition, so I&#039;ll go talk to her. You send for the others and then hang around in case I need support.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Excuse me?” Spike said, as calmly as he could with his reflexes on high alert.</p><p class="double">It was strange, feeling the fury and despair roiling from the mare&#039;s mind as she turned to him with a polite “yes?”</p><p class="double">Whatever else, she had impressive emotional control.</p><p class="double">“Well, I was wondering...” Spike considered, then went for broke. “Are you new to this loop?”</p><p class="double">Her eyes widened. “Loop? Do you mean-” The question went unfinished.</p><p class="double">“Time Loops, yes.”</p><p class="double">“Are there such things as vampires here?” she asked, the words almost tumbling over one another.</p><p class="double">“No,” Spike replied firmly.</p><p class="double">“Are there such things as <i>werewolves </i>here?”</p><p class="double">That one took a moment more thought. “No true werewolves, one hobbyist.” Fluttershy was Awake, after all.</p><p class="double">The mare exhaled. “Right. <i>Right.</i> Thank you for the help.”</p><p class="double">“Hold on,” Spike added, before she turned to go. “What&#039;s your name?”</p><p class="double">“Clear Water,” she answered, and left at what looked like a cross between a canter and a lope.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, any ideas?” Spike said, having finished reporting the conversation to the rest of the local Loopers.</p><p class="double">“I think I know.” Twilight winced. “And if she&#039;s who I think she is, then she is in serious need of help.”</p><p class="double">“Well, don&#039;t keep us in suspense, dear,” Rarity admonished.</p><p class="double">Twilight reached into thin air, rummaged for a moment, and plonked a set of books down on the table.</p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>me</i>,” Dash muttered, as they all looked at the front covers of the <i>Twilight</i> books.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Leah Clearwater sat back on her hind legs in the forest, not far from where she&#039;d... appeared.</p><p class="double">No vampires. No werewolves.</p><p class="double">For once, she was safe.</p><p class="double">Bending down, she bit off some grass. It tasted... bland, really.</p><p class="double">She could live with that. Boring was something she needed.</p><p class="double">Every rustle of a twig, every errant breeze... they set her off. Made her fine-tuned instincts scream warning, after hundreds of years of living on a knife-edge.</p><p class="double">It was a simple equation.</p><p class="double">Meet Edward Cullen when in human form, he finds out about her having travelled in time – and about her deep and abiding hatred of him.</p><p class="double">Get too close to the pack when in wolf form, they find out the same thing – and a less bitter but still intense dislike.</p><p class="double">Mistakes had gotten her killed before.</p><p class="double">But she was <i>safe</i> here.</p><p class="double">“Safe,” she murmured. Willing herself to believe it.</p><p class="double">It would take some doing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight finally said, some hours later. “I think that&#039;s everything.”</p><p class="double">Fifty or so suggestions had been pared down to the more realistic ones, and then again to the most important ones.</p><p class="double">Equestria was a sanctuary loop, but technically their responsibilities ended there... but none of them felt comfortable <i>not</i> helping someone in that much trouble.</p><p class="double">Stretching, the Anchor peered out the window at the long shadows of evening. Then blinked, and looked at a clock.</p><p class="double">“Your Highnesses...” she said, weakly. “You&#039;re late.”</p><p class="double">Celestia and Luna sat bolt upright in their chairs, exchanged a look, and changed day to night in seconds.</p><p class="double">“Sorry,” Luna said with a wince. “Lost track of time.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Happens to all of us. I think I forgot the first time I was a Royal Sister... something about a research binge, and then the guards started asking why it was still Tuesday.”</p><p class="double">Scattered chuckles greeted that remark.</p><p class="double">“Anyway...” Twilight turned to Spike. “Can you check?”</p><p class="double">He nodded, and closed his eyes. Three long, deep breaths, and they opened again. “I think she&#039;s asleep.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight nodded at the princess of the night. “You&#039;re up.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A pair of ice-cold eyes were staring down at her.</p><p class="double">She ran, but nothing she could do got them off her. They were digging into her, revealing all her secrets to a man who had killed in the past and would kill in the future if he felt it to his advantage.</p><p class="double">In a panic, she phased to wolf. The eyes closed, but nine other sets of pitiless golden eyes opened, all around her.</p><p class="double">A kind of pitying dislike battered her thoughts. Contempt for her skills. Fear of the outlier – the female werewolf. Resentment that she dared to phase in front of them, coupled with lingering images of her own body – attached to an unmistakeable emotional overlay that made her feel dirty.</p><p class="double">Hard to tell her thoughts from theirs. Impossible to keep secrets.</p><p class="double">Her father, dying of shock from seeing her change shape. Her brother, upset to see her. Her boyfriend, with eyes only for another – again, and again, and again.</p><p class="double">Self-loathing. What was wrong with her body? Why didn&#039;t it just <i>work?</i> Even when she didn&#039;t phase, it never... worked.</p><p class="double">Then the flood of memories... stopped, as though cut with a knife.</p><p class="double">A full moon shone gently down on her, in a calm and quiet forest.</p><p class="double">The images, wolves and vampires, melted away.</p><p class="double">“Leah Clearwater?”</p><p class="double">She raised her head, looking for the speaker, and shifted back to human. “That&#039;s me.”</p><p class="double">From a pool of moonlight, a... well, a winged unicorn... faded into view. “This is a dream – it was a nightmare, and a bad one. Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">She chuckled. “I&#039;ve been worse.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn nodded. “You are currently in Equestria&#039;s time loop, not your own. I have the ability to walk in dreamscapes, and wished to come here to extend an offer to you.”</p><p class="double">Leah blinked. “Okay. Sure.” She shook her head, as memory returned. “I&#039;m in horseland at the moment.”</p><p class="double">“Equestria,” the unicorn stressed slightly. “I am Princess Luna, younger of the diarchs of the nation you are in.”</p><p class="double">“Luna,” Leah repeated. “Well, you know who I am... so, why?”</p><p class="double">Luna pursed her lips – an interesting sight, on a horse. “We are familiar with the world you are from. Frankly, we feel sorry for you.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t need pity.” Leah&#039;s response was instant.</p><p class="double">“An admirable trait... but only if not taken too far.” Luna shook her head. “It is not pity, so much as...” she paused. “I have no personal experience with your world. But from what I have been told, that you are still sane is quite the accomplishment.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not convincing me,” Leah said, frowning. “Sorry, but...”</p><p class="double">Luna clamped down on what she was about to say, and mulled over her words for some time. Finally, she began again. “Please, consider it. Though I would not presume to bribe you, nor to offer you coercion, I think it would be good for you. And...” another silence. “One of our number, one of the younger loopers, has experience with how to construct a mental shield. One which remains operative no matter your form.”</p><p class="double">Leah tried to damp the incredible spike of relief which those words woke, remembering all the other times things had gone wrong. “That&#039;s a powerful incentive.”</p><p class="double">Silence returned, stretching for several more minutes.</p><p class="double">“Where would I find you?” Leah eventually asked.</p><p class="double">Luna sighed with relief. “In the town you were in earlier this day, there is a tree with a house built into it just off the main square. Two of us may be found within... along with a selection of library books.”</p><p class="double">The werewolf surprised herself with a chuckle. “Okay. I&#039;m not promising anything, but...”</p><p class="double">Luna bowed, then smiled. “Confine when you go to sleep to the hours of darkness, and I will do all I can to keep you from nightmares. That is a gift.”</p><p class="double">With that, she slowly faded from view.</p><p class="double">Now alone in the dream-scape, Leah shifted back into a wolf.</p><p class="double">Then she lay with her muzzle on her paws, and cried.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac walked into the Books and Branches, carrying a satchel of books on each flank. “Afternoon, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Hello, Mac,” Twilight replied with a smile. “Harvest done?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Mac started unloading the books – mostly reference books about alchemy, along with something about liquid rocket fuel. “AJ got lazy and did &#039;em with telekinesis. Thanks fer th&#039; loans.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s no trouble.” Twilight shrugged. “What were you doing with them, by the way?”</p><p class="double">“Tryin&#039; to come up with somethin&#039; potent enough fer a dragon.” Mac shook his head. “No go so far.”</p><p class="double">Twilight picked up the rocket fuel book and opened it at the first reference tab. “This is about hydrazine.”</p><p class="double">“Spike didn&#039;t even burp.” Mac chuckled. “One o&#039; these days ah&#039;m gonna invent a tumbler material that can handle Chlorine Triflouride. <i>That</i> should do it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced.</p><p class="double">The bell jangled as she flipped through Mac&#039;s notes. “Come in.”</p><p class="double">“Is this a bad time?”</p><p class="double">She looked up, and saw it was a somewhat-familiar blue mare. Leah.</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s fine. Mac knows.” Twilight flared her horn, flipping the door sign to closed. “Okay, let&#039;s get this sorted out.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How much do you know about the loops?” Twilight asked, offering Leah her choice of benches in the underground lecture room.</p><p class="double">(She had an underground lecture room this loop. Trixie had insisted on a suitably elaborate underground base.)</p><p class="double">“Not much,” Leah admitted. “I know I&#039;m – I was – stuck in some kind of sick Groundhog day thing, but years long.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight nodded, levitating a thin wooden stick and clicking to the first slide. “The Time Loops started when the computer that basically underlies all reality – Yggdrasil – got badly damaged. The Loops are a kind of fail-safe mode, which is how reality is being preserved as it&#039;s worked on and fixed.”</p><p class="double">She clicked to a second slide. “At first, just five worlds started looping, and the rest were static. Time passed, and the area being stabilized expanded – resulting in more looping worlds. We&#039;re in my home world, Equestria, several steps down the line. Yours is at least six more, but we haven&#039;t done a precise count – the idea of &#039;at the same time&#039; kind of blurs in this situation.”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused. “Oh, feel free to stop me if you have any questions.”</p><p class="double">Leah just nodded.</p><p class="double">“Now, each looping world has what&#039;s called an Anchor. They&#039;re the person who keeps it stable. Other people loop, but the Anchor is the one who always does – others may or may not.”</p><p class="double">“Does that mean that I&#039;m one of these Anchors, then?” Leah asked.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m almost certain you are,” Twilight replied. “I&#039;d be surprised if you weren&#039;t. Now, the reason you&#039;re in my world is what&#039;s called a fused loop. These are a bit more complicated...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After the lecture was over, Leah remained silent for a few minutes.</p><p class="double">“I see,” she said eventually. “So... does that mean the reason I can&#039;t have children...”</p><p class="double">“It might be partly due to your phasing,” Twilight hedged, “but no looper can have children anyway unless they did the first time around, as I understand it.”</p><p class="double">“Good to know I&#039;m not <i>that</i> much of a freak...” Leah muttered to herself. “Right. Okay. Just one question – how do you all know so much about me?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s... one of the stranger things,” Twilight said, picking up a set of books on a sideboard with her magic. “Every world we&#039;ve ever discovered in the loops, bar one, is like a version of some fictional material from another world. Yours isn&#039;t the lone exception.”</p><p class="double">She deposited the books in front of Leah.</p><p class="double">“Sorry to say, they&#039;re mostly from Bella&#039;s point of view.”</p><p class="double">Leah picked the first one up. “Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Twilight said, then winced. “Oh, that&#039;s going to happen a lot this loop...”</p><p class="double">“Wait, your name&#039;s Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle. Sorry I didn&#039;t introduce myself before...”</p><p class="double">Leah blinked, then burst out laughing. It was a slightly hysterical, desperate laugh in character – but it <i>was</i> laughter.</p><p class="double">“Oh, my sides...” she said, panting, as the fit wound down. “That&#039;s <i>bad</i>.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not usually a walking pun!” Twilight protested. “Just when this universe comes up.”</p><p class="double">“Mine, you mean.” Calming down, Leah opened the first book. “Ew... sparkly vampire.”</p><p class="double">She looked up. “Edward&#039;s a lot scarier than this in reality, though.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded soberly. “I can barely imagine. I&#039;ve actually been to your world, once, though I was actually in Bella&#039;s place – I don&#039;t think your world had started looping yet. I neutralized the Cullen&#039;s magic and had them arrested.”</p><p class="double">Leah&#039;s jaw dropped. “That&#039;s... that&#039;s perfect. That&#039;s the best revenge I could have come up with!”</p><p class="double">The unicorn shrugged, embarrassed. “I don&#039;t like killing.”</p><p class="double">“Neither do I,” Leah said, then shrugged. The gesture carried a deep weariness. “Not like I have much choice sometimes, though.”</p><p class="double">The silence stretched out after that.</p><p class="double">After a few minutes, they heard the library bell tinkle again.</p><p class="double">“That must be the others. I&#039;ll go tell them where we are.” Twilight stepped to the door, then paused. “If you want to, you can read those books to get some sense of how your world works from the point of view of Bella. I won&#039;t force you, though.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Leah nodded.</p><p class="double">“And – I want to make one thing clear, Leah. If we&#039;re making you uncomfortable, say so and we&#039;ll stop. If you want to go, we&#039;ll let you. We won&#039;t force you to do or think anything, and we&#039;ll make clear <i>what</i> we can do so you can make a judgement call.”</p><p class="double">For a moment, Twilight&#039;s eyes seemed to harden. “Equestria is a safe loop. And that&#039;s one thing we all know you need.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight waited until the others were seated, then sat down herself.</p><p class="double">“Everything going all right?”</p><p class="double">“Fine,” Spike replied.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara and Fluttershy nodded their agreement.</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s more of us than this,” Twilight added to Leah, “but these three are probably the ones you&#039;ll get the most help from first. Okay, guys, full disclosure.”</p><p class="double">Tiara spoke first. “My name is Diamond Tiara. I am a P-2 telepath and telempath thanks to a rather strange fused loop, though I&#039;m deliberately not trying to receive right now. I&#039;m trained in how to teach others to shield.”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded. “Yeah, that&#039;s going to be immensely helpful. That jerk Edward...”</p><p class="double">“And the pack,” Twilight added gently. “Shielding works both ways – project and receive.”</p><p class="double">The visiting anchor looked down for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was slightly raw. “Keep going.”</p><p class="double">Spike cleared his throat. “I&#039;m Spykoranuvellitar – I usually go by Spike. I&#039;m a dragon, and since one of <i>my</i> first fused loops was in the Star Wars world, I&#039;m basically a Jedi. That makes me a receiving empath by default, though again I&#039;m maintaining your privacy as far as I can.”</p><p class="double">Leah shook her head. “This is just...”</p><p class="double">“Overwhelming?” Twilight suggested. “I&#039;ve had that myself. We actually corresponded with the team who were our own sort-of creators once.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d like to give mine a punch to the jaw,” Leah said <i>sotto voce.</i> “What about you?”</p><p class="double">“Um... I&#039;m Fluttershy. I specialize in animals and vetinary work, and I&#039;m... sort of a shapeshifter.”</p><p class="double">“Huh. Well, fair enough.” Leah looked around. “What about... Luna, was it?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s asleep right now, I think,” Twilight said, checking the time. “She said she was helping you have dreamless sleeps.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. I&#039;d... like to thank her, if I can.”</p><p class="double">“Shouldn&#039;t be a problem,” Twilight said confidently. “Our loops tend to last several years, you&#039;ll have the time. Now, I&#039;d guess that you&#039;d like to learn from Tiara first. Is that correct?”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded. “Yes. I&#039;d... <i>really</i> appreciate being able to keep my thoughts mine.”</p><p class="double">Spike stood up. “Okay. D.T, do you want me as the other side?”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good.” Diamond Tiara stood as well, and frowned. “Wait, where&#039;s the side rooms in this place? I lost track of the corridors, I&#039;ve never been down here.”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ve never <i>had</i> this before,” Twilight replied. “Trixie built it. I&#039;ll show you the route.”</p><p class="double">“Right, gotcha. Suppose we&#039;re lucky she didn&#039;t build a space station...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, not bad. Now, try and hold it for a few minutes.” Tiara looked across at Spike and nodded.</p><p class="double">Spike reached out a hand, closed his eyes, and focused.</p><p class="double">There were a few seconds of silence, then Leah winced. “Ow. Who did that?”</p><p class="double">“That was me,” Spike admitted. “Tiara wanted me to test if you could pick up an attempt to read you. Looks like you can.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s something...” Leah rubbed her forehead with a hoof. “I&#039;m guessing you still got <i>in</i>, though?”</p><p class="double">“No, actually,” Spike said. “The shield held until you started talking. You&#039;re doing fine.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s been a week...” Leah said. “I know you have school and stuff, Tiara, but I feel like this is taking forever.”</p><p class="double">The filly thought about it. “Actually, taking into account all the meditation I&#039;ve been getting you to do when I&#039;m at school or at home, you&#039;re about average.”</p><p class="double">She made a face. “I know Bella takes, what, three hours to get her magical anti-mind-reading shield to cover an entire platoon&#039;s worth of people, but that&#039;s <i>not</i> normal. Hay, I&#039;ve got an advantage at this sub-field, and it took me ages to manage a group shield.”</p><p class="double">“Advantage?” Leah asked, trying to form a shield again.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve seen my cutie mark?” Leah nodded, and Tiara went on. “Well, one of the things we&#039;ve noticed in the loops is that they have a <i>lot</i> of interpretations. Mine&#039;s got a diamond in it, so... hard shields is the aspect of psionics I&#039;m especially good at.”</p><p class="double">Spike chuckled. “That and being a diamond-hard hard-assed b-”</p><p class="double">“Aren&#039;t Jedi supposed to be above name-calling?” Diamond Tiara asked archly.</p><p class="double">“Not that I&#039;m aware of!” Spike replied cheerfully.</p><p class="double">Leah chuckled, still concentrating.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sorry, guys,” Tiara said, getting up. “I&#039;ve got to head home now. Dad gets upset if I&#039;m out too late.”</p><p class="double">“That, right there.” Leah shook her head. “It&#039;s so... strange, I suppose. I mean, I&#039;ve been through hundreds of years and all that, but... it&#039;s strange to think of a kid doing that.” A shadow passed across her face. “Apart from that half-vampire one from my home.”</p><p class="double">“You think it&#039;s strange to think about?” Tiara asked. “Try living it. I&#039;ve been in charge of armies before, and now I&#039;ve got a bed time...”</p><p class="double">“Is that common?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m about Tiara&#039;s age, in one sense.” Spike shrugged. “But dragons can grow with strong enough emotion, and Twilight and I reverse-engineered it so I can basically change physical age at will.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;s about how everyone reacts.” Spike opened the door for Tiara to leave, then glanced back at Leah. “Should I get Fluttershy to come down?”</p><p class="double">“Sure, go ahead.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, what helps me is that... I don&#039;t think of it as being &#039;me and the wolf&#039;...” Fluttershy paused. “Or me and the panther, or me and the budgie, or... well, any animal – they&#039;re just me. I&#039;m sort of comfortable-ish in a lot of forms, but that&#039;s because of practise.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know what you mean in one way.” Leah lay back against the wall. “But... well, every time I see Imprinting, every time I get given an order by an Alpha, it frightens me. My wolf side has instincts – powerful ones – that it feels like could take over at any time. Stop me from being <i>me.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Fluttershy nodded. “Okay, let&#039;s have a look at this from a different direction. Could you transform for me, please?”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded, and erupted outwards into her lupine form. At a gesture, she padded out to the centre of the room.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy walked around her, muttering under her breath and occasionally casting a small spell.</p><p class="double">“I think I see,” she said, a few minutes later. “You&#039;re not quite a natural wolf – but we already knew that. The unusual thing about it seems to be linked to how you got the form in the first place... and yes, your instincts <i>are</i> misfiring. They&#039;re originally from a <i>male</i> wolf, and the conversion to female didn&#039;t go quite right. I think we can sort it out with a few weeks&#039; time.”</p><p class="double">Leah shifted back to pony. “Will that last?”</p><p class="double">“It should do. They&#039;re already trying to snap into the right shape, they just don&#039;t know what the right shape <i>is</i>... for an unusual interpretation of &#039;know&#039;, of course.”</p><p class="double">“Okay. Thanks.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s no trouble at all,” Fluttershy insisted. “Though I&#039;d like to get my hooves on the shamans who cast this spell. I&#039;d... give them a big telling off.”</p><p class="double">Leah laughed.</p><p class="double">“As for the two things you mentioned – neither of them is natural. They&#039;re like... some stupid <i>idea</i> of how wolves actually work.” Fluttershy frowned momentarily. “Wolves mate for life, but they don&#039;t instantly lock onto a mate. That&#039;s... silly. And if a wolf doesn&#039;t want to listen to the pack alphas, they just leave.”</p><p class="double">“You seem pretty angry about it,” Leah ventured.</p><p class="double">“I <i>am</i>. Well,” the pegasus backpedalled, blushing. “Cross. I&#039;m cross, because wolves don&#039;t behave like that and because all these changes do is hurt people. They&#039;re almost like curses.”</p><p class="double">“Now that I <i>can</i> believe.”</p><p class="double">“Though...” Fluttershy paced in a circle. “No, I can&#039;t be sure enough. I&#039;ll let you know if I get anything.”</p><p class="double">Leah nodded. “Sure. Now, what&#039;s for lunch?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy rummaged in a set of saddlebags. “Here we are. Watercress sandwiches.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sorry I&#039;m late,” Spike said, pushing the door open. “I had to help Twilight and the others with the Nightmare Night preparations.”</p><p class="double">Tiara nodded, and gestured to Spike&#039;s seat. As he sat down, she gave him a meaningful look and then pointed at Leah.</p><p class="double">He closed his eyes, and reached out with the Force. Gently at first, then with more and more power behind it.</p><p class="double">“Well?” Tiara asked some minutes later, when he sat back.</p><p class="double">“Couldn&#039;t get anything. In or out. You?”</p><p class="double">“Me neither.” Diamond Tiara grinned. “Well done, Leah. That shield should hold up against anything, so long as you can hold it.”</p><p class="double">Leah looked at them, still holding the shield. “What&#039;s next?”</p><p class="double">“Next, we make sure you can hold it when you&#039;re under stress.” Tiara tapped a hoof on the floor. “I was going to ask how we stress-test her, but the answer&#039;s simple. Trixie.”</p><p class="double">“...yeah, that&#039;ll work if anything will,” Spike agreed. “I&#039;ll let her know.”</p><p class="double">“Still, she deserves a week or so off,” Tiara mused. “What about Nightmare Night itself?”</p><p class="double">“Which is?”</p><p class="double">“I think the earth equivalent is an American-style Halloween. Lots of costumes, that sort of thing – and trick-or-treating.” Spike grinned. “I&#039;m going as Captain America!”</p><p class="double">Leah blinked. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Because it is <i>hilarious</i> to watch everypony trying to work out what the costume is,” Spike answered. “Want to join us? I&#039;m going around with Tiara, her friend Silver and the Crusaders, because they need someone to look after them.”</p><p class="double">“I could kill you with my <i>mind</i>,” Tiara said blandly.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but then Rarity would avenge me.” Spike shrugged. “How about it?”</p><p class="double">“So I&#039;d just, what, phase to wolf and spend the evening getting candy?” They nodded. “Sure.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s see...” Fluttershy said, pacing in a circle around Leah just outside a thin circle of wolf fur. “I think that&#039;s everything...”</p><p class="double">She looked at Leah. “If you want to back out of this, then now is the time. It will be... painful.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m ready,” Leah said promptly. “Do it.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus nodded, then erupted with light.</p><p class="double">Leah clamped down on her instinctive reaction to flinch, and forced herself to keep looking.</p><p class="double">When the light died down, there was a glittering necklace hanging from Fluttershy&#039;s neck – and she was an alicorn.</p><p class="double">Silently, her horn began to glow.</p><p class="double">The yellow fingers of magic spread out to fill the room, then concentrated into the fur circle. It took on a golden lustre, rose into the air-</p><p class="double">Pain lanced through Leah. Unbidden, she phased to wolf, and the magic jumped across from the fur to her.</p><p class="double">Foreign thoughts invaded her mind. Simple thoughts – the behaviour of a normal wolf. There was some sapience there, some ability to reason – some language – but not much.</p><p class="double">Then her own, old instincts awoke, rising from the depths of her mind to take over.</p><p class="double">She screamed as the two sets of instructions clashed, with a sensation like fire running down her spine and up through her head. Her personality – what made her <i>her</i> – was shunted aside, only able to observe. And hurt.</p><p class="double">For a moment, she seemed to be entirely <i>outside</i> her own body, looking down on it as it flailed in agony. Then everything went black.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you alright?” Fluttershy&#039;s voice woke her.</p><p class="double">Leah opened her eyes, and wished she hadn&#039;t. A migrane stabbed her in both eyes, and she closed them again with a yelp.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear...” Fluttershy said sadly. “Hold on, try this.”</p><p class="double">Soothing warmth spread through her. “There.”</p><p class="double">This time, opening her eyes just got her a headache. She tried to stand, and fell over when her paws didn&#039;t want to work properly.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry. You&#039;ll be fine in a minute.” Fluttershy&#039;s next sentence sounded apologetic. “I had to sort-of rebuild your instincts from the ground up, so they&#039;re still calibrating.”</p><p class="double">“Ow...” Leah muttered... then blinked. “Dihd aye jussst-”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy eeped. “Oops. I think this means you got the optional extra...”</p><p class="double">Shaking her head, Leah tried again. This time, it came out a little closer to intelligible. “How cahn I tallk?”</p><p class="double">“I might have made a mistake,” Fluttershy admitted. “I&#039;ve had to cast Origin of Species a few times before, but usually speech is just part of what goes into it. I think I included it out of habit.”</p><p class="double">“Well... no harm done, I suppose,” Leah said, feeling her jaw. “<i>Man</i>, but that&#039;s going to confuse the rest of the Pack.”</p><p class="double">She sniffed the air.</p><p class="double">“Oh, you must be hungry.” Fluttershy trotted over to the door, left for a minute, and came back in as Leah was trying to stand up again. Something big dragged on the floor behind her. “Here. It&#039;s venison.”</p><p class="double">“Are... you okay with that kind of thing? Hunting?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shrugged. “I fill up half my subspace pocket with ethically sourced meat whenever I get a chance, because – yes, animals here do tend to sapience. But this is fine. Roast, actually.”</p><p class="double">Leah needed no further instructions.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, so... how long did that take?” Leah asked, still slightly startled by how <i>much</i> food she&#039;d put away.</p><p class="double">“The magic?” Fluttershy checked. At Leah&#039;s nod, she went on. “Three days.”</p><p class="double">“...okay, wow.”</p><p class="double">“Epic-grade magic is like that.” Fluttershy shrugged. “I can&#039;t cast it very often, either, it drains me in ways which are permanent. But-” she held up a hoof, forestalling what Leah was about to say. “I don&#039;t mind.”</p><p class="double">“Well... thanks.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled.</p><p class="double">“Seriously,” Leah went on. “You guys have been great to me. I was a wreck when I got here, and...”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry about it.” Fluttershy stood. “Now, you still need to finish recalibrating your instincts... want to go for a run?”</p><p class="double">Leah stood, finding it much easier than even ten minutes ago. “Sure.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Two shapes, one larger than the other, loped through the uncertain light beneath the boughs.</p><p class="double">The smaller one changed course, bounding off a tree trunk to turn, and the larger one threw up divots of earth as she matched it.</p><p class="double">They emerged into a clearing where a tree had recently fallen, and the smaller one gathered herself before leaping at a startled bear. The impact bowled the bear over entirely, and the smaller wolf licked his throat before jumping off.</p><p class="double">“So...” the larger wolf said, amused. “Counting coup?”</p><p class="double">The smaller one nodded, with a trace of embarrassment. The bear, meanwhile, headed home in confusion.</p><p class="double">“Anywhere I can give that a go?”</p><p class="double">The smaller wolf nodded again and turned, tossing her head to tell the larger one to follow.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, this is it, huh?” Leah said.</p><p class="double">“Pretty much,” Twilight replied. “Our loop normally ends tonight.”</p><p class="double">“Well, in case I don&#039;t get another chance... thanks, all of you.” Leah smiled. “You&#039;ve been lovely.”</p><p class="double">The various loopers of Equestria shuffled, embarrassed.</p><p class="double">Leah looked again at the small bracelet she&#039;d been given. Well over a dozen silver charms dangled off it, most of them styled for cutie marks of those she&#039;d met here. (The rest were a little more allegorical – Spike, for example, was represented by a silver flame.)</p><p class="double">Then she dropped it into her new subspace pocket, where it wouldn&#039;t get lost. She could only keep one thing in it at the moment, but – well, one was enough.</p><p class="double">“How are you going to spend the last evening?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Leah shrugged. “Not got a particular plan, really. Why?”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Good. Pinkie?”</p><p class="double">Then a hundred party poppers detonated at once.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Leah&#039;s eyes opened, showing her the ceiling of her room.</p><p class="double">Her room at La Push.</p><p class="double">For a moment, she wondered if it was a dream – then she concentrated, and the bracelet appeared in a little flicker of light.</p><p class="double">She smiled happily, then put it away again. <i>Not a dream.</i></p><p class="double">Standing up, she contemplated exactly how to do things this time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the three new vampires emerged from the treeline, they arrayed themselves so that one of the males was in front of the others. Clearly, Bella reasoned, he must be the leader.</p><p class="double">And their eyes... were red. Sinister red.</p><p class="double">Then something very large and silvery-grey shot past her, cannoned into the other male, and tore him apart.</p><p class="double">Bella could hear Alice&#039;s exclamation of surprise, and tried to work out what that could mean. Could it be that Alice hadn&#039;t seen this?</p><p class="double">Beside her, Edward muttered something about being unable to &#039;read&#039; the newcomer.</p><p class="double">While that had been going on, the enormous thing – creature – wolf turned whiplash-fast and pounced on the female vampire.</p><p class="double">Glittering venom and chunks of vampire went flying.</p><p class="double">Several crowded seconds later, and all that was left of the newcomers was debris.</p><p class="double">Then the wolf snorted in satisfaction, and... flowed into the form of a young adult woman. Wearing nothing at all.</p><p class="double">Bella gasped. Esme put her hand over Edward&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” the woman shouted – by her features, she was one of the Quilettes. A werewolf? “Can one of you burn these tossers? I don&#039;t have a lighter.”</p><p class="double">With that, she blurred again, and loped off.</p><p class="double">Bella could swear she was laughing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>39.1 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Albus Dumbledore sat in his office, staring straight and unfocused at nothing in particular. If there was one thing he hated about getting older, it was how the perception of time changed. To those children in their beds, three months would seem like forever and a day. But for someone who had as much clutter in his mind as he did, three months can pass by almost in an eye-blink.</p><p class="double">So when everything changed in a perceived eye-blink, Albus was caught completely off guard. </p><p class="double">It was supposed to be an exciting year. Harry Potter was starting Hogwarts, as well as some of the prominent wizarding family&#039;s children. He should have expected something was wrong when Flitwick described the American-raised girl as &#039;lively&#039; and &#039;energetic&#039;. Dumbledore should have remembered that the charms professor, who gets so overexcited by the most trivial of reasons that he tends to fall out of his chair on a regular basis, and whose hyperactivity served him very well on the duelling circuit, usually sees most people as plodding and slow. Anyone he calls &#039;exciting&#039; should have instantly sent up a red flag of warning.</p><p class="double">Instead, the first sign that this would be a most unusual year came during the school song. Instead of a mismatched collection of young voices, there came a song and dance number that Albus would have been sure was carefully choreographed had he not been caught up in the spell, himself. New children sang about being excited to learn magic, but also a little bit scared. Older kids sang about how hard they would have to study for their tests. Professors Snape and McGonagall sang a very lovely duet. Dumbledore, himself, felt the pressure on his occlumency shields but gave in when he noticed that the compulsion to sing was harmless. </p><p class="double">After speaking with the girl he believed to be responsible for the entertaining song and dance, McGonagall relayed that such a thing had happened before in Miss Pie&#039;s presence. She had called it a &#039;Heart&#039;s song&#039;. Apparently, the girl was a natural auralmancer. It wasn&#039;t without precedence; and like the others, the light reddish-haired girl seemed destined for the stage and a life of harmless entertainment. </p><p class="double">And then came the problems. Miss Pie&#039;s magic was, in a word, odd. Especially if she had to cast a spell over any sort of distance. An imperfect analogy was that casting a spell successfully was like throwing a ball at a target. However, Miss Pie&#039;s spells came out with far too much force and on a completely random trajectory every time. It didn&#039;t matter how she pointed her wand, there was no predicting what would happen.</p><p class="double">And then came potions class. After a cursory surface scan during the first dinner, Albus noted that Miss Pie&#039;s mental defences resembled the outer surface of an over-inflated balloon. He decided it was a curious aspect that was due to her auralmancy and left it at that. If he had been thinking properly, he would have warned Severus. Mental backlash was usually a result of practising legilimancy on a mundane animal. The human&#039;s mind worked on a much higher and faster level, and connecting it in any significant way resulted with the animal&#039;s mind torn asunder and the poor beast in a drooling coma. That it had happened to an accomplished legilimancer like Snape made Dumbledore only speculate at what breakneck speed the odd little girl&#039;s mind worked. </p><p class="double">It also made Dumbledore take over the potion-master&#039;s classes for the rest of the year to the cheers of a great many students.</p><p class="double">The first flight training lesson resulted in Mr. Longbottom with a sprained wrist and dislocated shoulder when Miss Pie caught him inches from the ground. The rest of the unsupervised class was taken up with Harry Potter getting a spot on the Griffindor quidditch team by saving Neville&#039;s remembrall from smashing on the ground while Miss Pie laughed wildly as she spun as fast as she could around all three axes – as though her broom was some sort of a gyroscopic carnival ride. Of course after fifteen uninterrupted minutes of crazy spinning, she carefully landed on the ground, took a few steps, and promptly threw up all over Mr. Malfoy before passing out on the grass. Had he had not seen it himself from his window, Albus would have never believed such a little girl could have eaten so much. </p><p class="double">Then there was the party for the house elves, the party for her housemates, the party for the first month anniversary of starting magic school, the party celebrating Professor Binn&#039;s new permanent retirement, and so forth. Oh, and the party for the Troll. Can&#039;t forget that one. Of course, using legilimancy and seeing Professor Quirrel casting an imperius and leading said troll into the school on Voldemort&#039;s spirit&#039;s orders had said spirit angrily and violently detaching and fleeing the school. That resulted in the second professor to be placed in Saint Mungo&#039;s hospital in a bed right next to Severus. </p><p class="double">A few weeks later, they had found Lockhart gibbering to himself in the Forbidden Forest. He was completely covered in medium, large, and extra large sized acromantula. Lady acromantula, Hagrid said – and Albus really, really didn&#039;t want to know how the gamekeeper knew of this fact. They had placed the replacement defence professor next to the Quirrel, the professor he replaced.</p><p class="double">Seeing as how the defence against the dark arts curse had gone into overdrive, Dumbledore couldn&#039;t coax anyone else to take the position. That was when the Ministry sent their choice to fill the vacancy. Albus and the other professors had a bet going of how long she would last. It looked like Trelawney, amazingly, would win the hundred galleons for her predictably dire prediction of less than one day. </p><p class="double">But the worst thing, the worst thing was – that after Miss Pie had been questioned and set free about her perspective of the tragic case of accidental magic gone wrong, Albus habitually reached into his bowl of lemon drops only to find that they – were – all – GONE!</p><p class="double">So now, all Albus Dumbledore could do was stare blankly at the wall and count the hours until he could race out to muggle London to get more.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;All I&#039;m saying is that Quodpod makes Quidditch look like a bunch of old ladies having a picnic,&quot; Twilight heard Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice before she and Applejack entered her room. They were the last two of her friends to arrive.</p><p class="double">&quot;Quodpod is half football – American Footbal – half baseball, half hot potato, and half storming the beach at Normandy. How many explosions does Quidditch have in one game? Zero. It&#039;s all about prancing around on your broom and trying to catch a tiny artificial bird. Thus, it&#039;s so boooring,&quot; Dash continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;Four halves?&quot; Twilight spoke up. &quot;Shouldn&#039;t it be four quarters?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quarters? I&#039;m surprised an egghead like you didn&#039;t know that Quodpod doesn&#039;t have quarters. Quodpod only has three innings, like hockey.&quot;</p><p class="double">Exasperated explanation on her lips, Twilight looked up into the grinning, teasing face of her athletic friend. &quot;Alright, you got me. Now, are you ready for Pinkie&#039;s letter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is anyone ever really ready for Pinkie&#039;s anything?&quot; Rarity spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well..,&quot; whatever Twilight started to say was lost as space folded into itself before unfolding to reveal Gummy. The small alligator was serenely and impossibly floating in midair. He slowly turned to face the girls, opened his toothless mouth, and made a noise like a foghorn. Then he vanished with a pop, leaving behind only a pink envelope.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know,&quot; Twilight preempted everyone&#039;s questions, &quot;And I don&#039;t really want to know. Now let&#039;s see how much sanity is still left in the UK.&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender-haired girl unfolded the letter and started to read. </p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, faraway friends! It feels like it&#039;s been a month since I&#039;ve last written to you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It has been a month,&quot; Applejack interjected.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and continued, &quot;But so much has happened, I don&#039;t know where to start. How about at the end of the last letter? That&#039;s a good place, right? Well, I may have gotten a little ahead of myself when I said I wanted to be Dolores&#039;s new bestest friend. That was before she gave me.... the book.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was like all the worst parts of all the worst books in the world were stuck together with worst glue and bound in horrible, horrible awful boring boringness. And Dolores wanted me to read it. The whole thing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I tried to. I really did. I got to the second page before I closed it and raised my hand. When no one called on me, I started waving it around as though I just didn&#039;t care – but secretly, I did care. Finally, when I raised my second hand and was about to do a puppet-less finger puppet show (and I think Lyra was right. Fingers are really, really neat!), Dolores – or Professor Dolly as I decided to call her, finally asked me what I wanted.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I told her that my awful book was so overfull of boring that it exploded. To which she replied that my book was perfectly fine and on my desk, so of course I told her that my watch was fast. She said I wasn&#039;t wearing a watch, but I couldn&#039;t say anything else as my book rose into the air and exploded into confetti. At first, I was worried at what Hermione would say about a destroyed book, but then I realized that I was replacing Hermione! Her name sounds like Harmony and that kind of rhymes with Pinkie. I should see if I could make a song out of that. Oh right, back to what happened in class.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I told a speechless Professor Dolly that it was okay and I forgive her for making me buy such a horrible textbook. It gone and can&#039;t hurt my brain any more, now. Then for some mysterious reason, she turned an angry shade of purple and gave me a detention. I think she wanted some private time so she could apologize in private.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Instead, she gave me a quill pen and told me to start writing &#039;I will not be annoying&#039;. It was good advice. No one likes someone who is being annoying at a party. But when I started writing, the pen hurt my hand. Professor Dolly asked if there was something wrong, but I said don&#039;t worry about it, I can fix it. And then I channeled my magic really hard to fix the pen and make it scratchy write somewhere else than on the back of my hand.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The people at that Saint Mango hospital said some horrible person etched the words &#039;I will not be annoying&#039; into Professor Dolly&#039;s brain, and that she can&#039;t teach anymore or remember how to walk on two legs or use a bathroom. But I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll fix her all up in no time. At least she has a bed near Locky Heart, Squi-rel, and Spooky Snapey, so she won&#039;t be sad and lonely. I&#039;m also fairly sure she would have wanted me to have all her moving kitten plates as an apology for that book, so now I have a lot of moving kitten plates. I decorated them all along the walls of Big Blinky&#039;s home. Both BB and Hedwig enjoy the how the kitties pretend to be scared whenever they see a giant legless lizard monster and a hungry owl.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy made a small squeaky noise that sounded very much like, &quot;Oh those poor plate kitties.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, unfazed, just continued with the letter, &quot;Speaking of those two, you may have noticed that Hedwig didn&#039;t come and deliver the letter along with gummy. Well, that naughty bird and her friend got into my polyjuice potion stockpile. Apparently, they&#039;re married now and expecting three.. I don&#039;t know. Coatl? Snakey-owl babies that will probably have wings and claws and invisible death-beam laser eyes? I figure after Pound and Pumpkin, it would be a restful relaxing vacation to baby-sit (coatl-sit?) these three once they hatch.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Speaking of polyjuice, I showed Mr. Beaky – who used to be the giant squid in the lake here, to Ron. But even though he lost his rat, Ron didn&#039;t really want Mr. Beaky as his new pet. I don&#039;t know why. I think Mr. Beaky turned out great. I fed him polyjuice with tiny bits of every kind of magical animal I could find. Each change made him look more and more interesting. I thought he would be a great pet for someone who didn&#039;t care for a small and somewhat uninteresting rat. But on the other hand, Ron is now no longer scared of spiders.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not much else is going on. Someone threw my friend, Harry Potter, a magic teleporting rock that hit him in the head and made him take an unscheduled field trip to a real live cemetery. He said that old Moldy Voldie was behind the whole thing, and that he managed to return by grabbing the teleporting rock after old Moldy got a new body; but no one believes him except for Ron and Neville and me and Big Al Dumbledore. I should really prepare a fun &#039;Hooray on Becoming Corporeal Again&#039; party for when old Moldy visits the castle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re doing defence by independent study and I&#039;m learning so much! I got force push down pat and almost got force lightning to go where I want it to. I also got this screaming book at the library, and while it distracted the librarian; I grabbed a whole bunch of books on runes and enchanting. I thought about baking another Pretty Party Candy-copter again, but decided instead to figure out how brooms work and made all these for you girls! Just treat this letter like a storage scroll and enjoy your gifts from this Holly Jolly Pinkie. And come on over in exactly one month from now. If my Pinkie sense is right – and it usually is, there will be a party and cupcakes and a castle invasion and balloons and streamers and everything! This is Magical Girl Candy Enchantress Pinkie Pie, signing out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and sent a small amount of chakra into the letter. Five festively wrapped boxes popped out, each with an easily identified cutie mark for the intended girl.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now be careful,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I&#039;m sure whatever Pinkie sent us is..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, I don&#039;t care what anyone said or what I had privately thought about you before!&quot; enthusiastically interrupted Rainbow Dash. The girl was wearing light blue arm and leg warmers, each with her old cutie mark on them. She was also gleefully floating near the ceiling, &quot;Pinkie Pie, you are now best human!&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Rainbow Dash opened the window and happily rocketed out into the evening sky. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">39.2 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">(X-Communication)</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Doctor Vahlen slapped the after action report on the table in front of her. &quot;How could this debacle occur? What sort of idiots are you letting into your strike teams these days!&quot;</p><p class="double">She alone of the three around the conference table had an armed guard, at her own insistence against some delayed action mind-control effect left during her mind to mind contact with Sparkle. She&#039;d already put herself through every form of mental scanning and test known to X-Com short of going in the containment chamber herself, and the results had been uniformly negative. Apart from a slight dizziness and a taste of Elderberries in her mouth, the contact had left no physiological changes or mental alterations, other than converting her normal cool and dispassionate attitude towards her &#039;specimens&#039; to an icy hatred in Twilight&#039;s case.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t care for your tone, Doctor.&quot; Commander Benford said sternly. &quot;Every member of that team is a veteran of multiple missions. It is not their fault that the primary objective was able to escape. Her ability to teleport at will and long range perception abilities made her impossible to pin down, as the report states.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;It&#039; not her!&quot; Doctor Vahlen exclaimed. &quot;Applying a gender to an alien species is ridiculous. It isn&#039;t even humanoid! Despite any superficial similarities in vocal tone, it is a non-human monster, and anthromorphising it in that fashion may lead to confusion.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen, the head of Engineering, spoke up for the first time. &quot;Are we focussing too much on one thing? Other than capturing Sparkle the mission went well. No casualties on either the civilians or the team, 100% removal of the alien presence, even intact plasma rifles and pistols. It&#039;s even given us a lead on the location of the downed UFO they arrived in, which may yield more materiel. I&#039;m also a little worried about the mission goals, or rather their relative importance. Normally rescuing the civilians is our top priority.&quot;</p><p class="double">Benford shifted in his seat. &quot;I wasn&#039;t happy with it myself, but my orders came directly from the Council. When compared with the potential threat Sparkle offers, even protecting civilians had... reduced priority.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As it should have!&quot; Doctor Vahlen interjected. &quot;Mein Gott! You&#039;ve seen the footage! It took an entire alien terror attack to pieces by <i>itself</i>. And it&#039;s clear that it wasn&#039;t even showing it&#039;s full power! It has to be stopped whatever it takes!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shen sighed. &quot;And I think you and the council are missing one important fact. Is Sparkle a potential threat, possibly the greatest we&#039;ve faced? Absolutely! But the key word is potential. Look at <i>her</i> actions so far. She was captured, treated like a prisoner, no an experiment! The interviews with those people at the Hot Springs showed she was sure that the team sent there would have orders to kill her, not surprising if she was taking her cues from Doctor Vahlen.</p><p class="double">&quot;Turn it around, if you&#039;d been treated that way by her people and managed to escape, wouldn&#039;t you do whatever damage you could, take revenge once the balance of power was in your hands? I&#039;ve calculated the energy requirements some of those things she did would require, and I&#039;ve already worked out half a dozen ways she could have erased this entire facility. Stick a lump of iron in a force bubble with a vacuum and transmute it to anti-matter, then drop it in the middle of the base with the forcefield set to decay once you were safely away.</p><p class="double">&quot;If she does have Doctor Vahlen&#039;s knowledge she could have thought of that. And the team that went to get her? She could easily have destroyed them before they&#039;d even landed. That energy lance she displayed went through Sectopod armour as if it was tissue paper. Skyrangers are nowhere near as well armoured, and given her detection abilities, I have no doubt she could have registered on them from a kilometre away as easily as if she was standing on top of the wing. Or she could have done exactly what she did to those aliens.</p><p class="double">&quot;Instead when she left, the worst she did was make some smart remarks...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what about me!&quot; Vahlen snarled. &quot;She violated my mind, stole my memories!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Without harming anything other than your pride. She also saved your life, or do you think she needed to include you in her defences when the guards tried to terminate both of you? She&#039;s even apologised and offered to provide her memories in return. Just imagine it, knowledge of a whole different world with completely different technologies...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And so we come to it,&quot; Vahlen returned. &quot;You&#039;re letting your desire to find out about this creature cloud your judgement.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I think you&#039;re letting your fears see a threat where none exists, or at least won&#039;t unless we drive her into it. On the other hand, those same powers that make her dangerous could make her an invaluable ally. We know the Ethereals lived for millennia, and made plans on that scale. Do you think the loss of one capital ship, one invasion force, will stop them forever? Wouldn&#039;t it be good to have alien allies the next time we&#039;re attacked? She already proved she was willing and able to protect humans she&#039;d just met, those Japanese civilians think the world of her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When she was the one responsible for the attack in the first place, whether you believe it was unintentional or not.&quot; Vahlen&#039;s tone could have stripped paint, and made it quite clear what she believed. &quot;They should have been brought back here. I&#039;m sure more detailed debriefing would have demonstrated some evidence of mental tampering.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whereas I think the only form of mental tampering she demonstrated was politeness, honesty and a willingness to protect them. People tend to reciprocate when someone acts towards them a certain way. She acted as if she believed they would treat her as a person, and they did. She even insisted on paying her bill!&quot;</p><p class="double">Commander Benford finally decided to put an end to the wrangling. &quot;Now is not the time for discussing our strategy. We need more information. Speaking of which Doctor Vahlen, what is your analysis of the coins we recovered?&quot;</p><p class="double">With one last glower at Doctor Shen, the scientist pulled a set of notes up on a tablet computer. &quot;Firstly, they are almost pure gold, with just enough alloying metals to make them tough enough to stand wear, though there are some anomalies present. They weigh fractionally over a half troy ounce, and are about the size of a dime, but thicker. One side has the stylised &#039;face&#039; of a unicorn, profile on, possibly the Princess Celestia Sparkle mentioned or some other important person. The obverse has an equally stylised solar disk. There is lettering around the edge, presumably a value or legend. The edges are unmilled. The witnesses say she had a large bag of similar coins, maybe three decimetres in volume.&quot;</p><p class="double">Benford raised his eyebrows in shock. &quot;Wait, she claimed to be on a tight budget and yet she had...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Roughly 40 kilograms of near bullion quality gold as her pocket change. About one million US dollars. The unmilled edges also suggest that the issuing authority isn&#039;t worried about theft, which all point to the fact that gold is common on her world, far more common than on ours anyway. That could be explained by some of the impurities nuclear analysis threw up. There is almost no lead, but there are mercury isotopes and both lithium and beryllium present. By comparison, almost all gold deposits have lead as a major impurity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen caught on immediately. &quot;You believe it was transmuted from lead?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you explain that for those of us without a degree in nuclear physics or metallurgy, Doctor Vahlen?&quot; Commander Benford asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Doctor Shen is right.&quot; Vahlen didn&#039;t look happy at having to admit that. &quot; Lead has multiple stable isotopes, Gold has only one. Mercury is one of the end products of the decay of radioactive isotopes of gold, a side effect of imperfect transmutation. Transmutation would also release 3 protons and between 10 and 14 neutrons per nucleus. Those could be absorbed by forming lithium atoms, but only unstable isotopes which would further decay. Beryllium is an end product of some of those decay chains as well as stable isotopes of lithium.</p><p class="double">&quot;How they prevented themselves from dying of neutron exposure or targeted the reaction I don&#039;t know, but the composition is consistent with gold created through nuclear synthesis. Other isotope ratios confirm the gold isn&#039;t from any terrestrial gold deposit, or even one from the same accretion disk. The gold wasn&#039;t mined on any body in our solar system.</p><p class="double">&quot;This only increases her... it&#039;s hazard level, it not only has a superficially harmless appearance and a clear understanding of how to manipulate humans, but also money to sway the weak minded. Fortunately, even a million dollars won&#039;t buy that much safety, and most people will be less accommodating to an alien.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a knock, and a harried orderly came in with a sheaf of papers. Commander Benford skimmed them and sighed. &quot;Well she&#039;s trying something. Last night, sixty thousand dollars, or rather twenty in British pounds and twenty in Japanese yen were stolen from an international bank in downtown Tokyo, or rather taken, and a sum of gold coins worth a market value of sixty five was left in it&#039;s place, along with a letter accounting exactly what was taken and showing that the gold covered it including seigniorage.</p><p class="double">&quot;There were similar &#039;thefts&#039; at a business-wear store in the Ginza district of Tokyo, a pachinko parlour in Takayama, nearest town to the Okayama Hot Springs, a high end computer store in the Akihabara ward of Tokyo, a camping shop and several convenience stores. In each case money sufficient to cover the goods taken was left under a purple force field with a letter that itemised them and an instruction that the money would be released when they were rung up as sold, or in the case of the pachinko parlour, agreed to be replaced using the money.</p><p class="double">&quot;We still haven&#039;t been able to remove the records of the alien attack from the internet, too many off-line copies, and people in Japan at least are already starting to comment about the similarities. We&#039;ve managed to keep the official news channels from carrying it, but I don&#039;t know how long that will last. It&#039;s pernicious, it keeps reappearing no matter how much our techs remove it or try to &#039;out it&#039; as a CGI fake.&quot;</p><p class="double">He shook his head. &quot;But some of these items make no sense! Packaged long-life snacks and vegetarian food, obviously. Camping gear too. A high end laptop computer, okay, if Sparkle can figure out how to work it she could get a lot of information. But two female business suits? Black shoe polish? We know she can alter clothing to suit her form, but what does she expect to do, walk into an office somewhere and get a job?&quot;</p><p class="double">He shook his head. &quot;Until we have more information, all we can do is wait and see.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double">Dear Princess Celestia (and everypony else),</p><p class="double">I am alright! By now your forensic mages should have worked out roughly what happened, if not where I was sent to. My interstellar clairvoyance system went horribly right, due to the after effects of a recently dissipated quantum singularity in the target system. It caused a massive thaumic backlash that created a metaphasic planar inversion, obviously after the fact. I&#039;ve included the specifics in the form of arithmantic formulas which I have no doubt you, Princess Luna and a number of senior researchers at the university will find enlightening. For every-pony else, the basic idea that rather than bringing light from a distant star-system to me, the volume of space containing me was sent to the target star system should be easier to understand.</p><p class="double">I landed on a habitable world, inhabited by humans, right out of the old filly-tales. Well not quite, while their knowledge of magic is nearly non-existent, their non magical technology is in advance of ours in many ways, though it has some odd lacunae. For example, they invented steam engines before the germ theory of disease, despite having invented lenses centuries earlier, and that&#039;s just one of the oddities. Their world is far more heavily populated and industrialised than ours and there are no other intelligent races on the planet. Or weren&#039;t. They were recently attacked by an alien race from another star, and barely defeated them after much strife, even killing.</p><p class="double">This made my own position precarious, as they were predisposed to assume any non-human race was hostile. Hopefully I am working to change that point of view, but at this time, even if you manage to duplicate the interstellar teleportation effect, I would advise against sending any-pony else, even though this world needs help, not only to recover from the invasion, but from the damage that was being done by over-population, over-industrialisation and subsequent environmental damage. Without magic, recovering from that is far harder for them.</p><p class="double">As this letter proves, I have managed to develop a way to send back messages, and will continue to report back my progress. Recreating the full transportation effect will require more effort and alchemically produced materials that do not exist here, due to the lack of magical knowledge. However, I believe I can duplicate the magical processes needed, and supply the power required due to the other surprising development. I was placed under conditions of great stress in the aftermath of my arrival, and in the process something similar happened to me as to Princess Cadence.</p><p class="double">I was thinking of my friends, how I wanted to see them again, how I didn&#039;t want them to worry, how much they meant to me, and I felt a connection as if they were around me, supporting me. I believe that my link to the Elements of Harmony rather than the presence of Spectrum stone triggered my apotheosis into an alicorn. Suddenly some of the more puzzling aspects of the many tests you set for me make sense. You realised I had this potential, and did your best to develop it.</p><p class="double">I intend to use my newfound powers to help heal this world, to show them that unlike the invaders, pony-kind can offer a helping hoof rather than stomping them into the mud. I miss my friends and family terribly, and include a number of personal letters for them with this one. You should be able to target return letters given the arithmantic information I included, and I hope to hear from them. I will do my best to come home soon, but even with my expanded powers, developing the necessary materials will take time, and in the mean time, there is another world that needs the magic of friendship to recover from what&#039;s happened to it. Out of all the unicorns in the world you chose me as your protégée, and it is time once again to demonstrate your faith was not misplaced.</p><p class="double">Your faithful student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">James Bearing, Solicitor at Law and owner of Bearing Legal Associates prepared for his first meeting of the day. From the phone call yesterday this should prove to be interesting. The client, one Twilight Sparkle, was having difficulty establishing her legal identity and needed legal advice on how to resolve things. </p><p class="double">With a name like that, he could fill in the gaps. Obviously her parents had been New Agers in the 1990&#039;s or part of some other group who wanted as little to do with the rest of the world as possible. They&#039;d had a child, (and the confirmation over the phone that she didn&#039;t have either a birth certificate or school records made him think dark thoughts about their suitability as parents) and now she was a young adult in her own right she was trying to break away from her parents&#039; lifestyle.</p><p class="double">Despite everything, she&#039;d sounded both practical and educated which implied she&#039;d done the remarkable task of teaching herself rather than relying on a school. That was impressive, and the fact that she&#039;d wanted to keep the call short and that she had no number of her own suggested that she didn&#039;t have very much money. While he couldn&#039;t work pro bono (he had a payroll to meet after all) he decided to keep his fees to the minimum possible. The fact that she&#039;d also had a nice voice had nothing to do with it. </p><p class="double">After all this was the reason he&#039;d taken up law in the first place, to help people since his poor maths skill meant he couldn&#039;t study how to build spaceships...</p><p class="double">There was a scream from the outer office, and other noises of disturbance. He got up from behind his desk and strode over to the door, pulling it open. He wasn&#039;t prepared for the resulting view. Mrs Williams, his secretary, who up until today had been a pillar of adamantine steel against whom even the most furious or frantic antagonist had dashed themselves fruitlessly was scrabbling at her phone, which seemed glued to the desk with a faint purple glow. Of the two law students who worked for him part time, Alexis was similarly frozen while Jason was trying to open the main door which seemed similarly jammed.</p><p class="double">But the centrepiece to this tableaux, and the probable cause, was the small purple unicorn... winged unicorn... who stood in the middle of the main office with a pained expression. The fact that she was wearing a women&#039;s business suit tailored to her form, complete with white blouse, neat blue cravat, sensible grey pleated skirt and even white leg stockings on her hind legs, was just a counterpoint to the general bizarreness. Either her hooves were naturally a glossy black, or she&#039;d painted them somehow.</p><p class="double">He cut off a meandering mental question as to who would sell pots of nail polish that big and tried to re-establish some vestige of long fled sanity. &quot;What is going on here?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn spoke in a voice he recognised. &quot;My name is Twilight Sparkle. I made an appointment yesterday. I know I&#039;m a few minutes early, but I didn&#039;t want to waste your valuable time. I&#039;m also sorry if I startled people when I teleported in, but I didn&#039;t want to be seen entering the building for obvious reasons.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mrs Williams finally recovered enough to speak. &quot;But you&#039;re a... a...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I am an alien. That is point of fact the problem.&quot; She gave a weary sigh. &quot;Look, in a few seconds I&#039;m going to release the door and phones. At that point do what you will, call the police, the army, animal control, whatever! Just don&#039;t expect me to hang around after you do. I&#039;m trying to avoid trouble, either causing it or being in the centre of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The glow faded and the door opened, while Mrs Williams found herself holding her phone. Twilight Sparkle lifted a hoof and made what seemed to be a &#039;go ahead&#039; gesture.</p><p class="double">Now that the initial panic had worn off, the various people seemed at something of a loss as to what to do, and slightly shame faced. Aliens stomping around blowing things up were something popular culture had prepared them for. Aliens trying to be friendly by flashing lights and playing brass instruments or even trying to make interstellar collect calls were in there too, but not so much since the recent unpleasantness. Aliens making appointments to see a lawyer was not.</p><p class="double">James decided that he&#039;d never forgive himself if he didn&#039;t find out what was going on and said, &quot;I think it&#039;s best if everybody just continues what they&#039;re doing, while I talk to our visitor.&quot;</p><p class="double">He stepped back and gestured for her to come into his private office. </p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double">39.3 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in an endless sea of white.

I know your name because it is my function to know such things. As for what is going on, that is rather more complicated.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath and collected her thoughts. Okay, telepathic voice offering information. She&#039;d be a fool not to listen. &quot;Well, I&#039;m not going anywhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a psychic chuckle. <i>Indeed. You are currently a sort of living ideal.

An ideal what?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>An excellent question. You exist as the perfect leader, the soul of a nation, the guide to greatness.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve ruled nations many times, and I may be good at it, but I&#039;m far from perfect.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>We all have our faults. But even now, there is a tribe of hunter-gatherers who are discovering the link between seeds and plants, and they long for order, organization, and insight. They dream of you, Twilight.</i></p><p class="double">She was starting to feel uncomfortable. &quot;I don&#039;t want to be worshipped.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Nor should you. You are not a god. You are limited by your people&#039;s productivity, their happiness, their finances. But you can drive to them to heights of achievement that would otherwise be impossible. Their scientists will research what you deem worthy. Their armies will follow your every command. Their culture will be as you shape it.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight floated in the void, silent, considering.</p><p class="double"><i>Or you could float here for a few millennia, until the end of the Loop.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, when you put it that way…&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Excellent.

This is a sister loop--did you ascend without me knowing about it? Like, in a fused loop or anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeeenope.&quot; The red pony watched as an umbrella lashed a licorice whip and rode by on end table made of felt. &quot;So... this is tha Discordian era?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, it is, we&#039;re Celestia and Luna – I&#039;m sorry, I just... usually this only happens AFTER a pony becomes an alicorn on their own.&quot; Twilight narrowed her eyes. &quot;Are you absolutely one hundred percent sure...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, Ah&#039;ve been nothing but an ordinary earth pony afore this... cept when Ah was a human. Ah&#039;m as clueless as ya&#039;ll.&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender mare let out a growling sigh. &quot;We&#039;ll figure it out later, then. So, since this is your first sister loop--well, I guess it&#039;s a sibling loop, cause--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Macintosh blushed, fidgeting a bit. &quot;No, no, it&#039;s... it&#039;s a sister loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Oh.

Oh, yeah, okay, that could be awkward.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...&#039;while Awake?&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeeeeeeah, genderbending happens pretty often. There&#039;s around a two percent chance you&#039;ll wake up and, POOF!&quot; Twilight chuckled and rolled her eyes. &quot;Nothing to worry about, we&#039;ve all been through it. And hey, you&#039;re still pretty big!&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Anyway, we need to distribute the Elements between us now--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, AJ&#039;s been a stallion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mac.&quot; Twilight spread the necklaces, although she put the tiara on her own head. &quot;Elements.&quot;</p><p class="double">The red pony shook her head. &quot;Right, right.

Here, take Kindness instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">The former stallion eyed the pink butterfly warily for a moment. Then, with a shrug, she put it around her neck; might as well go full scale with this. &quot;Ah think Ah&#039;ll take Loyalty too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared as she wrapped the red lightning bolt around her thick ankle. &quot;....I am so jealous of you right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing.&quot; Twilight coughed. &quot;So, um... Generosity for you, then? And I&#039;ll take Laughter...

Before him was a young red haired girl with an excited gleam in her eye and energy to burn. &quot;I&#039;m surprised Twilight didn&#039;t explain this, she really seems to enjoy her loops here.&quot;</p><p class="double">The red haired girl simply grinned. &quot;Ah&#039;m more excited at the tech being used for all this. Your sayin&#039; that y&#039;all have holographic tech despite bein&#039; a baseline human world?&quot; She asked, playing down a face down card. Bloom Wheeler, or as Yugi had guessed earlier in the day, Apple Bloom, had replaced Serenity Wheeler for this loop. She had also proceeded to heal her eyesight in ways that not only had the doctors baffled but both Yugi and Joey knowing that she cheated, given that her own words to them when asked were: &quot;Ah&#039;m not missin out on a single moment in this loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorta. It&#039;s all being used for the purposes of enhancing Duel Monsters at the moment.&quot; Yugi stated, even as he flipped up a trap to counter her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, so advanced tech is being used for the sole purpose of-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, we&#039;ve heard that reaction before.&quot; Yugi interrupted with a nervous chuckle. Not entirely good memories in those loops. &quot;Still, with a few nudges, it gets picked up fast by pretty much everyone.&quot; He added, drawing a card and playing down Blackland Fire Dragon. The loop was still early, after all he hadn&#039;t even faced Kaiba yet and so still had his old deck. &quot;I attack.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom grunted, even as she mentally calculated. &quot;Right... then lets see if ah can do this.&quot; She stated, drawing a card... and grinning. &quot;Ah win.&quot;</p><p class="double">Yugi blinked. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah win. I drew Apple-Xodia.&quot; Bloom stated with a cheeky grin, flipping the cards around, to show each looked like an equine version of Exodia on an apple background.</p><p class="double">Yugi blinked... then grinned, even as golden light surrounded him. While he looked slightly taller and with a more serious look, Bloom could tell by his attitude that this wasn&#039;t the same Yugi. &quot;Well done, it takes a lot to get such blatant cheating past my partner.&quot; Atem commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheatin&#039;? Ah see no cheatin&#039; here, I won it fair an&#039; square.&quot; Bloom remarked as she retained the same grin.</p><p class="double">Atem just grinned. &quot;Just don&#039;t try it with the holograms, these cards have microchips in them for recognition and the Duel Disks especially can detect cheating&quot; He pointed out. He gathered up his cards into the deck and shuffled, Bloom doing the same. &quot;Now, if you want cheating, let me tell you the time I turned one of Kaiba&#039;s biggest monsters against him.&quot;</p><p class="double">They began again. Then Bloom laid down a spell card on her first turn, and Yugi&#039;s face met the desk. &quot;Honestly, Bloom...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? Ain&#039;t nothin&#039; wrong with the card, &#039;cept Ah&#039;m gonna win next turn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29924" rel="nofollow">Test of Endurance</a> isn&#039;t even from Duel Monsters!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pfft.

Three kunoichis together on a team wasn&#039;t very common, but it had happened before.</p><p class="double">What worried the jonin was that the pink-haired girl was excitingly pumping her hands up and down close to her body while chanting &#039;Ninja party! Ninja party!&#039;; while across from her, the blue-haired girl was doing the same thing, except chanting &#039;Explosive tags! Explosive tags!&#039;.</p><p class="double">Between them, the blond girl was staring at nothing in particular and occasionally shivering, as if anticipating some horrible future calamity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, my cute little students. My first impression of you..,&quot; Kakashi managed to say before being cut off by a pink blur that resolved itself into a girl, standing on a chair, whose face was only half an inch away from his own.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you our new sensei? Oh, what&#039;s your speciality? Do you like parties? Do you know how to make seals? They seem like a fun thing to learn. Do you wear that mask because you have horrible breath? I like balloons! Do you think I can make a taijutsu style based on that?&quot; Words poured from her mouth in a never-ending stream.</p><p class="double">Kakashi placed a hand over the girl&#039;s mouth to get a moment&#039;s reprieve, &quot;I think I hate you all.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blond girl snorted in amusement, &quot;Have a nice how do you do to you, as well. Welcome to team seapony diplomacy. Let&#039;s hope we all survive.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Survive? You won&#039;t be taking on hazardous missions until you pass training,&quot; Kakashi said.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was speaking of training,&quot; the blond girl said, adding, &quot;The name&#039;s Applejack. The pink thing licking the inside of your hand is Pinkie Pie. The one drawing explosive tag runes on everything is Trixie. Please take care of us and may whatever kami you worship have mercy on your soul.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi sweat-dropped and pulled his now moist hand away from the grinning girl&#039;s mouth.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next day at the training ground, Kakashi strode up to his new potential students. Applejack had made herself a small bunker using what looked like freshly uprooted trees. Pinkie Pie was running around arms outstretched, and making zoom-zoom noises. Trixie was reading a book on the sealing arts that Kakashi could have sworn was only available to ANBU members.</p><p class="double">This just cemented his planned course of action to fail this team and wait another year until the fourth&#039;s son and the last Uchiha graduated.</p><p class="double">One explanation of the test later, Kakashi was finishing up, &quot;All you have to do to be one of the two that pass is get one of these bells from me before noon. Starting now. Any questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie raised her hand, &quot;Do you mean these bells?&quot;</p><p class="double">She raised her other arm which was holding two very familiar bells.</p><p class="double">Kakashi blinked, then looked down at his belt. His bells were gone. &quot;What? How did..?&quot;</p><p class="double">He looked up to see Pinkie Pie now holding a very familiar book.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooh, what&#039;s this story about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not for children!&quot; Kakashi shunshined and grabbed his book before Pinkie could read any of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! Stand right there,&quot; Trixie exclaimed, &quot;I have no idea how sensitive my new motion detecting explosive tag is. That&#039;s why I made hundreds of them. I didn&#039;t have enough paper, so I used leaves.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi stood very still. His well developed danger sense was suddenly screaming at him. He looked downward, and yes, he was standing on a pile of seal-inscribed leaves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you said whoever gets the bells, passes, right?&quot; Pinkie exclaimed, &quot;So here you go, you two.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gave one bell to each of her team mates. &quot;I got the bells first, so I passed. Now you two have the bells so you pass! We all pass!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not how it works,&quot; Kakashi said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure it does!&quot; the pink-haired girl chirped, &quot;I even knew you were going to be busy so I forged your name on all the correct papers. We&#039;re a team now, so you have to get ready for the &#039;Kakashi passed a team&#039; party. It&#039;s in your apartment, sensei. I&#039;ve already invited all of your friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack casually lifted one of the enormous trees in her impromptu fort and walked out, waving, &quot;Thanks for the test. I mean, it&#039;ll be good to have one normal person on this team, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie waved also as she walked away, adding, &quot;No sudden movements, unless you want to let me know what the blast radius is.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi waited until the girls were no longer in sight, before sighing sadly, &quot;This is my life now. But with those skills; if I&#039;m lucky, I can get them to chunin before the year is out.&quot;</p><p class="double">A stray leaf fell from a nearby tree and drifted passed, only slightly brushing the jonin&#039;s nose.</p><p class="double">Kakashi sneezed.</p><p class="double">As he noticed all the leaves around him were now armed and glowing angrily, his last thought before waking up in the hospital was, &#039;Under no circumstances should that Trixie ever, ever meet Deidara.&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>Far off in the Land of Tea, Twilight put down her book as she heard a large explosion in the distance. She looked up at her mentor, Celestia, who was currently taking Tsunade&#039;s place in this loop, &quot;So who do you think that was? Trixie? Pinkie Pie? The Crusaders? They&#039;re all awake this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tsunade thought about it before shrugging, &quot;Who knows. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find out shortly. I think I&#039;m just going to take my winnings and try every one of the different teas they have here. So many blends. So many.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just sighed in exasperation and went back to reading her book of advanced medical jutsus.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile back at the academy, several voices rang out in unison, &quot;We&#039;re going to be the most famous super awesome ninja ever!

Once again, she was the advisor of a mare with far more brilliance than common sense, and so her duty was to sort the good ideas from the bad. And, as with Puddinghead, Cookie was frequently rebuffed, if not outright ignored.</p><p class="double">Of course, that didn&#039;t mean she was going to stop trying. &quot;Before we begin,&quot; she said to the clubhouse at large, &quot;I would like to say once again that this is a monumentally bad idea. I would say it&#039;s right up there with that time the chancellor wanted to put us on the potato standard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Weren&#039;t potatoes discovered after the Exodus?&quot; noted Clover.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. They were. Parliament was complaining about inflation, so Puddinghead made up the word one day and said that since it didn&#039;t exist at all, it was an even better choice than gold. <i>That</i> is how bad this idea is, and you&#039;re being <i>serious</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">Before the assembled Crusaders and Devices could consider this further, Apple Bloom waved a hoof dismissively. &quot;Aw, c&#039;mon, Cookie, quit exaggeratin&#039;. Ain&#039;t that bad. B&#039;sides, yer scarin&#039; &#039;em.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you&#039;re scaring me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What <i>is</i> your idea, Apple Bloom?&quot; asked Sweetie Belle. She wanted more information before she decided whether or not to be scared.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s real simple,&quot; Bloom began. &quot;See, we&#039;ve all gotten our cutie marks b&#039;fore, but they never stuck. But there is somethin&#039; that sticks from Loop t&#039; Loop once y&#039; pull it off.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Subspace pockets?&quot; guessed Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cool tricks from other universes?&quot; tried Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. &quot;Ascension.&quot;</p><p class="double">At first, the other Crusaders just boggled at her. That didn&#039;t last very long. &quot;WHAT!?&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth filly just smiled. &quot;Way Ah figure it, anythin&#039; that earns ya yer wings or horn or both has gotta be worth a permanent cutie mark!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle squirmed. &quot;Isn&#039;t that, well… drastic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Gotta be, if it&#039;s gonna last through th&#039; universe resettin&#039; itself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t we need something like the Elements of Harmony, though?&quot; Scootaloo thought back to the story of Rainbow Dash&#039;s ascension. &quot;Plus, we&#039;d need to do something that isn&#039;t just super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing, but related to our special talents.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly!&quot; Apple Bloom exclaimed. &quot;That&#039;s why it oughtta work in th&#039; first place.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you have feats in mind?&quot; asked Clover.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Sweetie&#039;s easy. Just gotta get &#039;er to start a big-enough heart-song.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn in question frowned. &quot;How big is &#039;big enough&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;I dunno. All o&#039; Equestria?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All of…&quot; Sweetie&#039;s mouth flapped silently as the very idea dropped stage fright on her like a ton of bricks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039; know which song&#039;d work fer that, though,&quot; Bloom admitted. &quot;Figured y&#039; might have some ideas, Sweetie.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pale filly had frozen in place at this point. She tipped over onto her side, totally stiff and unmoving.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo poked her. No reaction. &quot;Um, what did you have in mind for me, Apple Bloom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Less sure in yer case, Scoots. Somethin&#039; like that time with the weather-magic Blackbird might work, but it might not be enough. Maybe go &#039;round the world without flappin&#039; yer wings?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Without…&quot; Scootaloo didn&#039;t lock up. She did jump to her hooves, wings flared. &quot;Do you know how ridiculous that is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Ah&#039;ve hardly ever been a pegasus, so… nope!&quot; Apple Bloom smiled and shrugged. &quot;Ain&#039;t s&#039;pposed t&#039; be easy, Scoots. Otherwise, there&#039;d be a lot more alicorns.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, Miss Not-Supposed-To-Be-Easy. What about you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom scowled. &quot;That&#039;s th&#039; thing. Ah can&#039;t think of a darn thing fer me. Ah thought maybe inventin&#039; the Internet, but just gettin&#039; Equestria up t&#039; that point o&#039; technological advancement&#039;d prob&#039;ly take longer&#039;n one Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo settled back down and smirked. &quot;Seems perfect to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah guess, but… I dunno. It don&#039;t feel right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Does any part of this fool&#039;s errand?&quot; asked Smart Cookie.</p><p class="double">Sweetie shuddered and picked herself up off the floor. &quot;Um, maybe we should come up with ideas for one another?&quot;</p><p class="double">The other fillies considered this, nodding almost in sync. &quot;Meet back in a week?&quot; Scootaloo proposed.</p><p class="double">&quot;A moment, please,&quot; said Cookie. &quot;Pansy, Clover, please tell me you aren&#039;t actually encouraging them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re necklaces,&quot; noted Pansy. &quot;It&#039;s not like we can stop them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the concept is actually quite fascinating,&quot; Clover added. &quot;Applied apotheosis? Especially that of an unmarked filly? I&#039;m composing a theoretical framework as we speak.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine, then. Enjoy your folly, girls. If anypony wishes to be sane, you know where to find me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned. &quot;Well, you heard &#039;er, girls. See y&#039;all next week.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies brought raised forehooves together. &quot;<b>CUTIE MARK CRUSADER ALICORNS!

And so is FOOF. They don&#039;t <i>need</i> air. And since FOOF is a gas, the most I&#039;d be able to do is send the stuff flying all over the place.”</p><p class="double">She flared her wings as some of the smell came near them. “Ick. And I hope you&#039;ll notice I had to Ascend to handle it, so now I need to come up with an excuse for <i>that</i> as well. What were you trying to make, anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Mac drawled, “Ah thought it&#039;d make a good carbonated-type of beverage fer dragons, and Trixie thought it&#039;d be the ideal rocket fuel.”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>40.1 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;When mixing these two, you have to use a tiny bit of red mercury and a lot of earth pony magic to stabilize the whole thing. Then just add a touch of cinnamon, a dollop of orange juice for flavour, and garnish with a ruby and a tiny umbrella; and viola!&quot; Berry Punch held the enchanted glass container up triumphantly in one hoof. Suddenly, the tiny little wooden umbrella caught fire and burned away to nothing. The rest of the drink bubbled and shook violently but settled down in the end, &quot;One serving of Foofy, the magic dragon drink of doom. And I should probably think of a better name for it, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh and Trixie looked on in amazement from their makeshift bunker inside Big Mac&#039;s bar. Spike looked on eagerly at the drink as he sat at a nearby table. Twilight was maintaining a containment shield outside, as well as being – in her own words – ready to teleport any foolish pony before they start choking on the inevitable burning poisonous fumes.</p><p class="double">&quot;How the hay did you know how to make that?&quot; the red stallion asked in wonder.</p><p class="double">&quot;While you all have been going on adventures and being princess of the moon and everything, &quot; Berry gave Big Mac a knowing look, causing him to fidget uncomfortably at the memories of being an alicorn – a <i>female</i> alicorn. &quot;I have been perfecting my craft. I can mix any drink and make it better than perfect. I can brew the most powerful spirits known to pony-kind. I can make the most delicious wines I have ever tasted. I have learned long lost recipes from the ancient temples in the wild jungles to the ruins in the frozen valley. And several loops ago, I decided to study dragons to see if I could figure out a perfect drink for them. Do you know that their stomach is more like a magical fusion reactor?&quot;</p><p class="double">Every pony turned towards Spike. The baby dragon shrugged. &quot;I knew that. Then again, I also studied other dragons for many, many loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Here you go.&quot; The light purple earth pony carefully handed Spike the glass. &quot;Drink it quickly before the ingredients eat through the magical stabilization. On a scale of one to ten, this thing has a shelf life of nope, it doesn&#039;t have a shelf life. And never, ever serve it to a pony – or really, anyone other than a real equestrian dragon. Otherwise, the customer will explode. Then their remains will explode. Then, whatever is left will require Sparkle to hit it with another entire lake bed before it makes the surrounding area unlivable.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike gingerly held the glass before downing it all in one long gulp. He set down the empty container as his eyes widened and his pupils grew to twice their normal size.</p><p class="double">&quot;Duck and cover!&quot; Berry Punch shouted and ducked under a table. Big Red and Trixie wasted no time in flattening themselves in their bunker.</p><p class="double">Spike opened his mouth and burped out an immense gout of green fire.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, sorry about your bar, Big Macintosh,&quot; he said sheepishly. The ponies turned around and saw that there was a smouldering hole through the far wall, and one in the wall beyond that one, and another through the final wall. They could see a shocked Twilight outside still maintaining a shield around the establishment.</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem. I got a couple spares of my bar in my subspace pocket. I can use one of them while I repair this place.&quot; The red pony turned towards the stunned little dragon, &quot;So how was the drink, Spike?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It... was... the best thing I have ever tasted! Nectar of the universe!&quot; Spike said enthusiastically. &quot;You should totally give her a job.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, the results do speak for themselves, Berry. You&#039;ve got yourself a job,&quot; Big Mac said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. What? I never applied for a job here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh shrugged, &quot;As more ponies find out about this place, it starts to be too much for just me to handle everything. If you want it and can be all professional-like, you can have yourself a job here. So for the loops that you&#039;re here, Berry, you can make full use of your special talent and be appreciated for it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch took a few seconds before nodding with a grin, &quot;Alright, if you&#039;ll have me. I&#039;ve never worked for you before. Plus the whole, &#039;I can talk about the loops because you are a looper&#039; thing is handy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It sure is,&quot; Big Mac sighed. Gilda was great and even Chrysalis was nice once he got to know her, but he still wondered if Cheerilee would ever start looping.</p><p class="double">Loops made everything just plumb <i>confusing.</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;I recognize that type of sigh,&quot; Berry Punch said. &quot;So what&#039;s, or should I say who&#039;s on your mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac just smiled and shook his head, &quot;Eenope. It&#039;s only your first day. Customers first. The bartender&#039;s problems are something for much later on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fair enough. Just give me a tour of the place and I can start helping with the cleaning. I doubt we&#039;re going to get too many customers with all those danger ribbons cordoning off the place while Sparkle maintains a magical shield.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you guys done it there?&quot; came Twilight&#039;s voice from outside, &quot;What was that fire blast? Spike, are you okay in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike the dragon just rocked slowly in his seat, mumbling, &quot;So good,&quot; over and over.</p><p class="double">Trixie strode out and exclaimed &quot;Success! For my next attempt at a drink for dragons, I shall try to create magical cold fusion in a glass!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm,&quot; Berry Punch contemplated. &quot;I actually have several ideas about that using flavored deuterium, tritium, and lime juice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac watched as the two mares climbed upstairs, talking while they toured his place. Then he looked at the dragon-caused hole in the nearest wall that was no longer only smouldering, but was merrily on fire. Perhaps it was time to seriously reinforce his bar.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile, in Canterlot, Princess Celestia looked down at the three circular pieces of different walls that had appeared in front of her before falling on the floor with a clatter. She looked towards her sister for a possible explanation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope,&quot; Princess Luna looked up at her sister and shook her head slowly. &quot;We have got nothing.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.2 (anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna did not usually consider herself an experienced Looper. She knew that her sister had experienced more lives than her own count, let alone the sheer number that the Elements of Harmony had lived. She was slightly afraid to ask Twilight Sparkle how old she was, for she had little doubt that the (usually) unicorn Anchor was possibly her elder by now.</p><p class="double">Almost all of Luna&#039;s loops took place in an Equestria much like the long-ago baseline, so she had long since grown used to Awaking on the moon, a far cry from the horror and panic she had felt the first time she had been returned to her prison. Still, the rare instances where she found herself coming to anywhere else were a pleasant change of pace.</p><p class="double">Even when she Awoke in a dirty alley with a too-bright morning sun in her eyes, like this Loop. Although she was in her accustomed alicorn form, the architecture surrounding her was enough to tell that this was probably some variation on the human world.</p><p class="double">“...is that a horse?” The trio of human males staring at her may have also been a small clue.</p><p class="double">“Be quiet,” Luna ordered. “I am trying to figure out who I am.” Loop memories could be tricky sometimes, but these were fragmentary even for that and trying to figure them out was rapidly giving her a headache.</p><p class="double">“...a <i>talking</i> horse?” one of the humans asked.</p><p class="double">“I said, be quiet!” Luna roared, and the humans scattered. She took a calming breath and tried to make sense of her new memories. She was... a survivor of a lost, ancient kingdom on the moon? Fair enough. She had some kind of mission too... the old enemy that had destroyed her people was returning, and it was her duty to defend the Earth against them. Check.</p><p class="double">Now, how was she supposed to do that? Luna searched her scattered Loop memories.</p><p class="double">“...find the Moon Princess?” she asked herself aloud. A little worried, she turned her head and was relieved to see her familiar mark on her flank. “That was easy,” she said. “Now what?”</p><p class="double">A commotion at the entrance of the alleyway made her raise her head again. She took one look at the murmuring crowd of humans, then transformed herself to shadow and escaped. If this – maddeningly vague in her Loop memories – enemy really was out there searching for her, discretion would be the better part of valor for the moment.</p><p class="double">That discretion lasted only until the early evening, when Luna was stirred from her nap on a high rooftop after a long day spent searching without luck for Twilight Sparkle. There was the crawling sensation of a dark presence nearby, and it reminded her just a little of how her own magic felt when she was Nightmare Moon. Before she even had a chance to consider Luna was in the air, searching for the abomination.</p><p class="double">She had a duty to protect her subjects, after all. Even if they weren&#039;t her usual subjects, and even if they didn&#039;t know they were her subjects yet.</p><p class="double">It took only a brief search, and it was only a moment&#039;s work after shattering the gem store window with her hooves to dispatch the demon. She had perhaps over-estimated the monster&#039;s strength; she&#039;d hoped to interrogate it but was left with only a pile of magically inert dust. She felt a little guilty for a moment, but she was uncertain the creature had been sentient to begin with, and it <i>had</i> been threatening a young human filly. Girl. Whatever.</p><p class="double">She checked the human – fainted, like the other humans scattered about the store – and cast a simple charm to ensure restful dreams before she was interrupted.</p><p class="double">“Who... what are you?” the male voice asked from above.</p><p class="double">Luna looked up to the high window she&#039;d broken, and saw a male, masked human figure in a strange outfit. Possibly the human version of a tuxedo, she decided. “It is polite to give one&#039;s own name first,” she returned, stretching her wings. Perhaps this was the person responsible for the monster; she sensed magic on him, unlike any other humans she&#039;d encountered this Loop.</p><p class="double">“You talk!” the man exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“So do you,” Luna replied archly. She hated these Loops where equines weren&#039;t intelligent by default. Perhaps she should do something about that when she had a chance.</p><p class="double">“I... I am... Tuxedo Mask,” the man said.</p><p class="double">“I see,” Luna said dubiously. She was reasonably sure that wasn&#039;t how humans named themselves this Loop. “I am Luna, the Princess of the Moon.”</p><p class="double">The man staggered like he&#039;d been hit, raising one hand to his face. “But... you&#039;re a <i>horse</i>,” he protested.</p><p class="double">“Pony,” Luna corrected.</p><p class="double">“I... I need to go,” the man said. His cape swirled, there was a flare of magic, and he was gone.</p><p class="double">Luna nodded to herself. Tuxedo guy was <i>definitely </i>suspicious.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Many of her classmates held the strong belief that Ami Mizuno was not human. The debate raged furiously over whether she was a soulless cyborg from the distant future or an inscrutable extrusion of a vast alien intelligence, but even here at cram school there were only a few lonely voices that supported her claim to humanity.</p><p class="double">It was perhaps a shame that all the other students were unconscious, because this afternoon – confronted with the unimaginable circumstance of being rescued by what she didn&#039;t yet know to call an alicorn princess from an actual demonic monster – she proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that she was a flesh-and-blood teenage girl.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re a <i>pony</i>!” Ami squealed in delight.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I am.” The equine paused. “Excuse me.” There was a flash of dark blue light, and the demonic schoolteacher flew back into the wall she&#039;d been bucked into moments previously.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re a <i>magic unicorn talking pegasus pony</i>!”</p><p class="double">“Do human&#039;s foreheads normally glow in this world?” the pony asked.</p><p class="double">“...no?” Ami said, suddenly feeling a strange sensation there and being shaken enough from Pony Proximity Euphoria Syndrome into realizing that, perhaps, this situation was <i>slightly</i> unusual. Almost downright unscientific.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” the winged creature said. Another flash of blue light revealed a small... pen? “I am Princess Luna,” she said, “and if I can trust these cursed defective memories, you are supposed to be Sailor Mercury, one of the guardian soldiers of the Moon Princess.”</p><p class="double">Ami stared at the pony.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s me, by the way,” Luna added, apparently considering that the most pressing thing to clarify. Encased in dark light, the pen floated closer to Ami.</p><p class="double">There were plenty of really important questions she probably should have asked. “Will I get to ride you?” came out instead.</p><p class="double">Luna frowned. “I suppose,” she allowed.</p><p class="double">Ami&#039;s hand, without conscious direction, grabbed the floating pen. “Deal. Umm... Your Highness.”</p><p class="double">Behind Luna, the demonic monster stirred again. The equine princess stepped aside. “Show me what you can do,” she ordered.</p><p class="double">Ami blinked. Twice. Then the demon jumped for her and instincts she never knew she had made her raise the pen high, words she somehow knew by heart ripping from her throat.</p><p class="double">“Well, bubbles,” Luna said a few moments later. “I&#039;ve seen worse special talents. We can work with that.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For the first time in countless years stretching beyond the boundaries of this life, the four guardian soldiers of the Moon Princess were gathered. Perhaps they would have been more excited if they hadn&#039;t just been fighting for their lives against two of the Generals of the Dark Kingdom.</p><p class="double">“Well done, my soldiers!” Luna exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“...why do you have a talking horse?” the newly arrived Sailor Venus asked.</p><p class="double">“Pony,” Sailor Mercury insisted.</p><p class="double">“I am Luna,” the equine in question announced, “the Princess of the Moon.”</p><p class="double">Sailor Venus blinked several times. “The h-<i>pony</i> is the Moon Princess?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Luna</i>?” another voice interjected. A white blur came down from somewhere and landed on Venus&#039;s shoulder.</p><p class="double">“...why do you have a talking cat?” Sailor Jupiter asked, her arms crossing.</p><p class="double">“Sister?” Luna asked cautiously, staring at the white cat with a golden moon on its forehead. Her accursed, near-useless Loop memories throbbed, like she should have recognized the feline.</p><p class="double">Venus giggled. “Sister? I knew there was something you weren&#039;t telling me, Artemis.”</p><p class="double">The cat swatted at her face with one paw. “I <i>told</i> you, it&#039;s not my fault the Greeks got my gender wrong.”</p><p class="double">It had been a long shot, but Luna was still disappointed. As far as she could without explaining the Loops to the human girls, she&#039;d searched for any sign that anypony – or even any<i>one</i> – else was Awake, and had found nothing.</p><p class="double">Artemis was now staring at her. “You&#039;re... Luna?” he asked.</p><p class="double">Luna tried to force her Loop memories to tell her who this cat was supposed to be to her, but came up with nothing. “I&#039;m sorry,” she said. “I do not remember who you are.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not sure I remember who <i>you</i> are,” Artemis said. “I... I didn&#039;t think you were a horse.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Pony</i>,” Sailor Mercury corrected again. Really, she got more offended by that than Luna did herself.</p><p class="double">“More importantly,” Venus interjected, glancing at her passenger. “<i>Is</i> she the Moon Princess?”</p><p class="double">“Of course I am,” Luna answered. If there was anything she was sure of in this Loop, it was that.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Artemis sounded a little dubious. He raised one paw to his head, like he was warding off a headache.</p><p class="double">“I could lower the moon now to prove it,” Luna offered – there was no point getting offended, given that the cat&#039;s memories of the old kingdom were probably as bad as her own. “It would probably panic the populace though.” She <i>never</i> felt right in these – usually human – loops where the moon and sun just went up and down on their own. It was downright unscientific. “Maybe we could go visit the old castle again?”</p><p class="double">“Umm... I don&#039;t think that&#039;s necessary, Your Highness,” Sailor Mercury said quickly. Luna was a gracious enough ruler to pretend not to notice the warning signs her guardians were giving the newcomer and her cat. Really, forget one lousy oxygen spell and you never live it down.</p><p class="double">Sailor Venus seemed to think for a moment, then knelt. Artemis lost his balance, and leaped down to the ground. “I am Sailor Venus, or Minako Aino, Your Highness,” the blonde girl said.</p><p class="double">Luna smiled. “Rise, my guardian.”</p><p class="double">“Are you <i>sure </i>you&#039;re supposed to be a pony?” Artemis whined plaintively.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The time had come for the final battle. It would happen here, in the heart of the Dark Kingdom itself, buried beneath the North Pole. (When Luna recounted the story to Twilight in her next Loop, that bit would send the unicorn on a particularly entertaining rant.) Minor demons scattered, unwilling to face the furious alicorn princess.</p><p class="double">“Moon Princess,” the waiting queen said, shadows hanging off of her like physical things. She carried a tall staff, which she tapped on the onyx floor.</p><p class="double">“Release your hold on the sun and end this night,” Luna stated coldly, “and some mercy may be shown to you, witch.” The air was thick with dark magic, enough that Luna half-feared to see black corruption staining her flank just from being here.</p><p class="double">The ruler of the Dark Kingdom threw back her head and laughed. “Foolish Princess. You think that I <i>could</i> bring back the sun? It is our Great Leader&#039;s power that blackens the day, not mine.”</p><p class="double">“Then I shall destroy you both,” Luna said.</p><p class="double">Her enemy laughed again. “You seek to slay both I and Queen Metallia alone, Princess?”</p><p class="double">“Not alone,” Luna said grimly, and she spread her wings. In this place, for once her darkly colored magic shone brightly, and the four she carried hidden underneath them returned to their full size, two on each side. “The guardian soldiers of the Moon Princess,” she proclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Sailor Mercury,” one said.</p><p class="double">“Sailor Mars.”</p><p class="double">“Sailor Jupiter.”</p><p class="double">“Sailor Venus.”</p><p class="double">“And in the name of the Princess, we will punish you!” the four finished in unison. Artemis had been upset to be left behind, but this was no place for a cat.</p><p class="double">The woman they faced just laughed again. “Endymion... kill them.” The shadows surrounding her parted slightly, revealing the man who knelt at her left, kissing her hand.</p><p class="double">He rose, drawing a sword. “Yes, Queen Beryl.” Luna was pretty sure she recognized him, and she snorted. She&#039;d <i>known</i> that tuxedo guy was up to no good.</p><p class="double">Endymion jumped high in the air, raising his sword for a downward slash. “Girls,” Luna prompted, and her guardians acted.</p><p class="double">Sailor Mercury clenched a fist, and a cloud of bubbles shrouded the man&#039;s head. Sailor Jupiter met him in midair, dodging the wild, blind swing of his sword and tackling him to the ground, lightning crackling around them. Still blinded, Endymion managed to throw her off but lost a hold of his weapon. Arcs of fire from Sailor Mars&#039;s hands pushed him back, and then a golden spear of light from Sailor Venus punched through his chest armor.</p><p class="double">The dark warrior gasped, staggered once, then collapsed at his queen&#039;s feet. Beryl&#039;s hand tightened around her staff. “<i>You</i>,” she snarled.</p><p class="double">“He&#039;ll live,” Luna said, keeping her voice cold. This wasn&#039;t the time for sympathy.</p><p class="double">“Just <i>die</i>!” Beryl roared, raising her staff and a hurricane of dark magic swept the room. Luna had barely a moment to shield her friends and then she was caught up in the storm. “Die, Moon Princess!” Beryl shouted again.</p><p class="double">Luna called on her own power and the winds stilled. She steadied herself with a beat of her wings and fired a moonlight spear at Beryl. The woman blocked it with a wall of black lightning, but it was only a distraction.</p><p class="double">Luna landed smoothly and was relieved to find all four of her guardians standing. “Now,” she said. Each of the four girls pulled out a small, brightly colored gemstone, while Luna summoned the three she&#039;d kept for herself. (She would have to ask Twilight if there had been any Loops with seven Elements of Harmony, as these “Rainbow Crystals” were clearly the local equivalent.)</p><p class="double">Beryl&#039;s eyes widened. “What,” she started. With practiced ease, Luna called forth the gemstone&#039;s power, merging it with the magics summoned by her guardians. The whole vast throne chamber started to shake, and Beryl stepped backward, her staff falling from her hands. “No!”</p><p class="double">As if in answer, a ball of white light formed in front of Luna. The dark force saturating this place stirred, but too late. “This ends now,” Luna declared, and the bright magic consumed everything.</p><p class="double">It was a strangely intimate thing, and Luna wondered if this was what it was like for Twilight Sparkle when she healed Nightmare Moon. The dark power – the “Great Leader” – Luna scoured from the world, dissolving every last strand of its being; it was utterly inequine and beyond salvation. Yet when she looked in her foes&#039; hearts, she found something different.</p><p class="double">Endymion – the tuxedo guy – had been being brainwashed after all. Well, that was easily fixed with this power.</p><p class="double">Beryl, though? Madness and betrayed hurt, a lust for power and recognition, callous disregard for the lives of others... all of that and more Luna found. But down in her heart, deep beneath everything, Luna found a girl who wanted to be loved. “Be healed,” Luna whispered and then, more than aware of the irony, she sent the dark queen to slumber on the moon.</p><p class="double">The light faded, and when it did the seven Rainbow Crystals were gone. Instead, a single gem floated before her horn.</p><p class="double">Endymion, his wounds healed, rose to one knee, staring at it. “The Silver Crystal,” he breathed. “You <i>are</i> the Moon Princess.”</p><p class="double">Luna still didn&#039;t know why everyone seemed to find that hard to believe. “I am,” she said.</p><p class="double">“I... just don&#039;t understand,” Endymion said. “Why are you a horse?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s a <i>pony</i>!” Sailor Mercury declared, throwing up her hands. “Why am I the only one who <i>sees</i> that?”</p><p class="double">Luna snorted in amusement, but her mind was elsewhere. She had <i>still</i> yet to find a single other Awake soul in this Loop, and if she understood one thing from Twilight Sparkle&#039;s explanations, it was that there always must be an Anchor in every loop. Surely Twilight would have found a way to contact her by now, but Luna knew that it was possible for her to enter a fused loop with a different Anchor.</p><p class="double">So... where was this Loop&#039;s Anchor?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In her small bedroom, Usagi finished laughing and let the image die on the crystal ball she&#039;d stolen from Beryl... oh, at least a thousand loops prior. She reached down and was sad to discover that the bag of popcorn she&#039;d brought up here was empty.</p><p class="double">“I hope you&#039;re happy,” a familiar voice came from nowhere.</p><p class="double">Usagi turned and watched the green-haired woman step out of thin air. “Oh come on, Puu,” she said, sitting straighter on her bed. “This is <i>hilarious</i>.”</p><p class="double">Perhaps a smile flickered briefly on the woman&#039;s face, but it was gone a moment later. “You realize that she sets up Endymion with Beryl later.”</p><p class="double">Usagi shrugged. “Not the real Mamo-chan, not my problem,” she said. “<i>I&#039;ve</i> done that a few dozen times. They make a cute couple when she isn&#039;t evil.”</p><p class="double">Sailor Pluto just stared at her. “You <i>know</i> how much work this is for me.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll help?” Usagi offered. “Look, I was going to introduce myself, and then she just went and proclaimed herself the Moon Princess! I <i>had</i> to see what was going to happen.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, you&#039;re going to help,” Sailor Pluto hissed. “Do you have <i>any</i> idea what Crystal Tokyo looks like now?”</p><p class="double">“A lot more ponies, I guess?” Usagi proposed.</p><p class="double">“Thanks to Mercury&#039;s Equine Uplift Project and her Poniform Transformation Spell, yes.”</p><p class="double">“The mind boggles,” Usagi asked. “Dare I ask where we&#039;re going to get a Chibi-Horse-Luna?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna stood tall and proud atop one of the skyscrapers of this human city, her mane blowing in the wind as she watching over the dreams of the sleepers below. This Loop was still a little strange, but, setting aside the question of the missing Anchor, it wasn&#039;t bad, really. The victory party had been fun, even if she&#039;d needed to dust off an old spell for taking on human form to avoid attracting too much attention.</p><p class="double">After so many Loops of being the ancient returning villain, it was refreshing to be the prophesied reborn heroine. And now, with the Dark Kingdom defeated and its queen safely imprisoned – though from her sifting though dreams she already could tell that the humans were a <i>little</i> concerned about the sudden appearance of a female face on their moon – she could start making longer term plans. Perhaps she could rebuild those old ruins up there to give herself a more comfortable place to call home? Or maybe she should just go public... the options seemed truly limitless.</p><p class="double">That was when <i>something</i> opened above her head and deposited a creature on her back. Luna grabbed it with her magic and brought it to float in front of her.</p><p class="double">The pink-maned alicorn filly started back at her, then giggled. “Yay! Hi, big sister!”</p><p class="double">Luna broke into a smile. “Hello, Celestia,” she said. “I&#039;m glad to see you.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.3 (Stavaros_Arcane)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Mac put the finishing touching on setting up his bar for this loop. He&#039;d gotten enough practice doing it that he could have a full stocked, ready to go drinking establishment open for business quick enough that you could almost Awaken in a loop with a drink in your hoof.</p><p class="double">Big Mac polished a glass while he waited for whoever was awake this loop to arrive to plan out their summer sun celebration shenanigans. What he did not expect was the door to be almost kicked off its hinges and a massive mountain of an equine to storm in.</p><p class="double">Mac thought the newcomer resembled the Horses of Saddle Arabia but the comparison felt...wrong. While the Saddle Arabians conveyed the calm of a breeze through an oasis, the new comer felt like someone had strapped a blizzard and a typhoon together and then shoved them in the form of a horse made of iron.</p><p class="double">There was the clop of heavy hooves as the newcomer approached the bar. It was then that Big Mac noticed something. The number of hoof beats was wrong. As though two ponies were walking in instead of one. A glance downward showed why. Eight legs. The stallion had eight legs. That made him...</p><p class="double">Big Mac looked up to find the dark grey stranger – <i>Sleipnir </i>– had closed the distance from the door to the bar counter. While there had been ponies tall enough to force Big Mac to look up in order to meet their eyes, never had anypony make him feel so small, even the Princesses or Twilight during his early loops didn&#039;t make him feel quite like this. Like he was a tiny speck in the vast cosmos, and yet the cosmos had turned its attention to him. Even for a looper it was rather intimidating – and usually Sleipnir had better control of his presence. Much better. To the point it was hard to notice the eight legs at times.</p><p class="double">But Big Mac was a rock, as like an apple tree with roots tapping into the very core of the world. He had spoken with beings of great wisdom that knew how to make the world turn on something as small as a tortoise turned right side up. So he did what he needed to do. Bartend.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;ll ya have?&quot; Mac asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll find behind your counter a cask of thrice blessed Aesir mead. We&#039;ll start with that and drink our way through the rest of your stock until the memories are well and truly drowned.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac was about to ask about the use of the term &quot;We&quot; when the Swiftest of Horses moved two of his limbs and lifted the shivering form of Twilight Sparkle off his back to plop her down on a seat beside him. &quot;Actually, grab me one of your families&#039; famous ciders. I&#039;ll hopefully be too drunk to truly appreciate them later.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac poured the drink order, briefly studying the cask that he knew had not been part of his stock a few minutes ago. As he placed the drinks in front of the two he asked &quot;Rough loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">He watched as in perfect unison the Anchor and the deity slugged back their mead, slammed their mugs down and said, &quot;You don&#039;t know the half of it!&quot; in unison.</p><p class="double">As Mac moved to refill their mugs the eight legged stallion drank his cider. Unlike the previous drink he savoured the flavour of the beverage. &quot;Twilight has just been through one of the worse hells you could inflict on a sane being. I would never wish it on any of my little ponies. So we&#039;re going to drink until those memories are two hazy to hurt anypony anymore, and then the healing can begin. I will make it up to you Twilight. &quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut in &quot;I appreciate what you&#039;re doing. Like you wouldn&#039;t believe,&quot; the Equestrian Anchor said as she took a large swig of her second drink. &quot; But I keep telling you that...&quot; Twilight shuddered. &quot;Wasn&#039;t your fault.&quot; she shoved the second empty mug to Mac and the red stallion refilled it again.</p><p class="double">Big Mac was now morbidly curious. &quot;She go through something bad in your home loop?&quot; he asked, assuming that Sleipnir&#039;s mysterious home loop had gone a little out of kilter.</p><p class="double">A smile briefly crossed the newcomers face, &quot;Nay, the suffering she went through happened in Equestria although you are closer then you realize. I blame myself because I should have been able to stop the file corruption in Equestria&#039;s Yggdrasil branch before it spawned that abomination scenario.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac blinked at the mention of the computer he&#039;d been told ran the multiverse. &quot;Wait... that means you&#039;re...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sleipnir Eight-Legged, Wotansteed, Lokison, Divine Beast First-Class, and System Administrator of the Equestrian Loops.&quot; The Horse God said. “Yes, I may have misled you a little on my importance; it comes of being related to Loki.”</p><p class="double">Big Mac blinked at the God and looked at Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">She shrugged. &quot;I was surprised too. Did not expect my first meeting with the god in charge of our loop to go like it did.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I didn&#039;t start my day thinking I&#039;d have to fend off an insane horde of ponies wielding a dragon tied to a toothless alligator either.&quot; Sleipnir snorted. &quot;I&#039;ll admit that was the only part of that loop that was remotely not traumatizing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac refilled their mugs yet again and poured himself one. He felt that he needed it. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered, finding herself almost curling up into a ball on instinct.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir looked like he was about to put a comforting hoof on the purple unicorn&#039;s shoulder before catching himself. She needed a few more drinks first to dull the emotional pain of that loop. &quot;We won&#039;t share the full extent of what happened. But it all started when I found some corrupt files in Equestria&#039;s systems. While the loops are beyond the control of even the gods, those of us who work with Yggdrasil&#039;s systems have the ability to influence them in certain ways. Programming an algorithm to drastically increase the probability of one emotionally distraught looper to visit a specific loop for their first fused loop. To rewrite code and allow a child to stay with their adopted mother instead of being wiped clean by a resetting loop. You get the idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir&#039;s demeanour seemed to change, giving off an almost paternal feel to the ponies around him. &quot;Of course then some idiot can just as easily cause misery and woe with an act of stupidity and crassness. The corrupt files created some unpleasant loops, and I wanted to track the source of them to help keep Equestria the safe loop you&#039;ve worked to make it. Well I found it. Somebody thought it would be a great idea to hide their massive collection of porn on my office computer. And I swear I will geld the Olympian son of an incestuous titan for it once I&#039;m done repairing the damage. The stuff was not only vile in its own right but was full of corrupt data and viruses, and the end result was beyond the stuff of night terrors.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir emptied his mug again and Big Mac pulled out a row of shot glasses and a couple of bottles. Sleipnir raised an eyebrow as the farm pony turned bartender shrugged. &quot;Mead&#039;s out. And this sounds like it&#039;s about to get worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grabbed the bottles with her magic and started rapidly filling each small glass. &quot;Eyup.&quot; Twilight said, stealing the stallions catchphrase. The alcohol was doing its work, which was the only thing keeping Twilight from starting to cry. &quot;You&#039;ve heard the horror stories about the loops with the insanely depraved alternate Celestia we call Molestia, right Big Mac.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac shuddered, &quot;Eyup.&quot; He&#039;d been lucky enough to avoid being Awake those loops so far but knew it was bound to happen sooner or later.</p><p class="double">Twilight continued. &quot;Now imagine an Equestria where her being in charge made <b>sense</b>!&quot;</p><p class="double">As Big Mac paled, Sleipnir picked up where Twilight left off, &quot;Whatever you are thinking of... It was worse. Not only was she in charge but she was the pinnacle of what every pony strove to be, the <i>ideal pony </i>in the eyes of her subjects! And Twilight was the only one Awake, the only sane mare in this mad mad mad mad mad mad mad mad world. And then this corrupted world painted a target on her by making her the most desirable mare alive to everyone in said world.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh mah god...&quot; Big Mac said his imagination giving life to a shadow of the terror described to him.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hear you.&quot; Sleipnir said with a nod. He barely registered what the last two shots he tossed back were. &quot;And then it got worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone in the room shuddered. Big Mac barely managed to get out a word. &quot;How?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir shook his head, &quot;You don&#039;t want to know. Trust me. YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment of silence and more bottles being brought out, Sleipnir spoke again. &quot;So I entered the Loop, something I&#039;ve tried to avoid because you ponies can handle yourselves without my meddling. Fought my way to Twilight Sparkle and then we both fought our way to the gates of Tartarus, changed which side of the door the locks were on, locked ourselves in, and then I called down a Gungnir strike ending the loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Never has a planet cracking divine orbital bombardment been more welcome.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now I&#039;m going to make it up to her, for all the suffering. This is a healing loop, and we&#039;re going to start by sterilizing the metaphorical wounds with alcohol. So. Cheers, everypony,&quot; he said, raising a glass to the group that had walked in during the tale of woe. The gathered Equestrian loopers rushed to comfort Twilight.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir smiled, glad he&#039;d had the forethought to have Spike message everyone who was Awake to join them. Now the healing could really begin. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.4 </p><p class="double">“Well, I hope never to have to detox Zeus&#039; account again,” Sleipnir said, sitting back on his rear legs with a long sigh.</p><p class="double">Loki leant back against the comforting bulk of his middle son, Fenris, and collapsed down his spear. “Indeed. What <i>was</i> that thing at the end?”</p><p class="double">“Basically Scylla and Charybdis merged with hentai,” Sleipnir answered. “<i>Not</i> fun.”</p><p class="double">Hel and Jormugandr trooped in, Hel&#039;s living side looking nearly as decrepit as her dead side and Jormugandr&#039;s crest drooping with exhaustion.</p><p class="double">“At least you didn&#039;t have to chase the thing down to be sure it was dead,” Jormugandr hissed.</p><p class="double">“And was it?” Sleipnir tapped on air, and his barding dematerialized.</p><p class="double">The world-serpent grinned, showing his myriad teeth. “Once I was done with it... <i>yes</i>.”</p><p class="double">Hel sat down next to her father. “It&#039;s good to have that over and done with...”</p><p class="double">“Sorry for calling you all into it,” Sleipnir said, embarrassed. “But, well, given that it had fused with Twilight&#039;s loop last time, I wasn&#039;t comfortable going in alone to make sure it was cleared off.”</p><p class="double">“Good call,” Fenris growled. “Not often we get to cut loose.”</p><p class="double">“You ate the planet.” Sleipnir paused. “Sort of planet. Well, okay, drive partition.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s what I do best.” Fenris chuckled.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir kicked him affectionately with a forehoof. “Goof.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s <i>me</i>, I think you&#039;ll find,” Loki pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Right, I think we might <i>all</i> need a drink after that. Wonder if Mac&#039;s got the bar set up yet...”</p><p class="double">“Why not just check?” Hel grinned. “Wonder how I&#039;d look as a pony.”</p><p class="double">Sleipnir summoned a Yggdrasil terminal. “Well, it might...” he tailed off, then blinked. “Huh.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Loki asked, craning to see the screen.</p><p class="double">In reply, Sleipnir tapped on it and pushed it away from the small group, letting it expand to cover one wall. The &#039;days since start of loop&#039; number flashed blue, drawing attention.</p><p class="double">“That...” Fenris looked closer. “That&#039;s bigger than I remember it being...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up.</p><p class="double">That in itself was unusual, since she&#039;d gone to bed after the end-of-loop party fully expecting to snap to attention reading a book.</p><p class="double"><i>Razzen-frazzen fused loops...</p><p class="double"></i>And her loop memories were on the fritz, too. How truly good. And <i>not</i> what she needed after that nightmarish loop before last.</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Spike skidded into her room, alarm in his voice. “Get up!”</p><p class="double">“What is it?” Twilight rolled out of bed. “And are you actually normal Spike this time, or have I missed some formative event that took place in the past?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight...” Spike said, slowly. “This isn&#039;t a new loop.”</p><p class="double">“Impossible,” Twilight replied bluntly. “Loops have a maximum length.”</p><p class="double">“Well...”</p><p class="double">Spike pointed out the window.</p><p class="double">Trotting over, Twilight shook her head to try to get rid of the inexplicable hangover.</p><p class="double">Then stopped dead.</p><p class="double">The ruins of Pinkie&#039;s “far-too-many-to-bother-counting-loop-end-party” were strewn all over her house, and the square, and half the rest of Ponyville as well. Ponies lay in various states of comatose on the floor, having been thoroughly Partied Out.</p><p class="double">Pinkie was still on a DDR machine.</p><p class="double">“But...” Twilight winced, then remembered enough magic to erase her hangover. (Drinking at the end of a loop wasn&#039;t supposed to make hangovers, so she&#039;d gone a little overboard.) “That&#039;s... how?”</p><p class="double">A clattering of hooves sounded on the balcony, and then Sleipnir came in through the door – causing a little minor structural damage, since he wasn&#039;t quite small enough to fit. “Twilight, good. Sorry for the short notice, I just found that getting rid of that stash of Zeus&#039;s has caused your loop to start expanding to take up the slack. It looks like you&#039;re getting about a week&#039;s worth of new time each stage of expansion... I think.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, so you fixed things too hard?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“Basically,” Sleipnir said with a nod. “Okay, must dash. My siblings and I have to go let the Norns know, and see if this is happening anywhere <i>else.</i>”</p><p class="double">He wheeled on two hooves, strode back up to the balcony, and vanished.</p><p class="double">Spike took a deep breath.</p><p class="double">“...so, what now?”</p><p class="double">“Now,” Twilight said firmly, “I go and find something that hasn&#039;t been drunk yet.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s done...” Twilight said, panting.</p><p class="double">“Giving up the Elements suuuuucks,” Pinkie moaned. “I&#039;m the Element of Laughter! It&#039;s my Thing! Well, that and being a Pink Lantern, but they&#039;re kinda related...”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s got a point, Twi,” Dash said in an unusually subdued tone. “We&#039;re so used to having the powers of the Elements on tap that... well, what does it mean for us?”</p><p class="double">Trixie walked in, dragging a huge mass of burning rosebush-like thorns from her left rear hoof. “That. Was. Not. Fun.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you at least kept the tree contained until we could sort it all out...” Twilight consoled.</p><p class="double">“True. But-” Trixie&#039;s eye twitched, and she flailed her hoof until the woody detritus fell off. “Oh, this is going to give me a <i>complex</i> if it happens every time...”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy brought over some towels and gently cleaned the cuts. Looking up at Trixie, she smiled wanly. “They don&#039;t look too bad. You should be fine – no real need to even use magic to heal them.”</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed. “Well, Trixie will see you next Loop. She understands that this one will not be <i>much</i> longer than normal?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, Sleipnir said something about extending in discrete jumps,” Twilight agreed. “I think there&#039;s about another five days to go for this lot.”</p><p class="double">“Because the Tree of Doom is a <i>perfect</i> way to end a Loop. Alright. <i>Buck</i> keeping a low profile.” Trixie flared her horn, Ascended and flew off.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Wait a moment...”</p><p class="double">The six remaining loopers exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">Then Twilight looked up, mouthed something, and closed her eyes.</p><p class="double">With a flash of violet light, her Element of Magic burst into being on her forehead.</p><p class="double">“Did it work?” she asked, eyes still shut.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Rarity breathed. Then, with another soundless flare, her Element of Generosity materialized.</p><p class="double">Four more followed in quick succession, and then a relieved laughter chased away the last of their anxiety.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“As far as I can tell,” Twilight said, by now on her fourth blackboard of notes, “when the tree was said to require the Elements, it was only after the physical representations – you know, the stone orbs from the Sisters&#039; Castle, or equivalent. But because by now they&#039;re basically part of our souls, they <i>can&#039;t</i> be taken away in any meaningful sense. I should have realized!” She rounded on her audience. “We&#039;ve used this fact <i>so</i> many times before! Every time we&#039;ve conjured the Elements into being to mess with Discord!”</p><p class="double">“So...” Applejack raised a hoof. “What all does this mean for us in a real sense?”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned back to the boards, and made a few more annotations. “I think it means that we need to make a policy of retrieving the solid Elements from the Sisters&#039; Castle every single loop. We can&#039;t really sustain the magic needed to re-actualize the elements if the energy isn&#039;t going back into us once we&#039;re done with them – so we just give the tree the appropriate Elements from the same loop, and we&#039;re golden.”</p><p class="double">“I see,” Fluttershy said. “Thank you for the explanation, Twilight. And – would you and Pinkie be able to join me the next time she, Discord and I are all Awake at the same time?”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight replied. “What for?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes hardened. “I am a kind pony. But I am going to hit him with every form of confection that I can think of until he feels sufficiently sorry for not warning us about that tree in all the time he has had to do so.”</p><p class="double">The others shuffled away from Fluttershy unconsciously.</p><p class="double">“...yeah, sure,” Twilight said, nodding. Then she sat down on a nearby chair. “I hope this kind of thing doesn&#039;t happen every time the timeline extends...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>40.6 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>Trixie took in her marefriend&#039;s pacing, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Chrysy.... you&#039;re in a rut.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, I know!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I mean, literally.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen glanced down, blinking. &quot;Oh. When... when did this happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;About half an hour ago.&quot; Trixie hopped down into the ditch, tapping the dirt around her. &quot;I&#039;m amazed it didn&#039;t happen sooner, actually, you&#039;ve been at this for hours.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis flinched at the accusation. &quot;I... I&#039;m trying to steel myself for this, but, but--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you&#039;re frozen by fear and shame and don&#039;t want to cause a confrontation, and every time you push one pillar of your emotions away you get snagged by another.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling gave Trixie a weak smile. &quot;Are you sure you&#039;re not part of the hive mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, I just know what it&#039;s like to be there. Ol&#039; Great and Powerful having to apologize to mares she embarrassed and terrorized...&quot; Trixie shrugged. &quot;Not as personal as your situation, of course, but I&#039;m sympathetic. And I know how hard it can be to do something like this...&quot; She took a breath. &quot;Which is why I want to preemptively apologize.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. &quot;Apologize? I don&#039;t understand, what did--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on, honey, what could be so importaaaaaaaaa.....&quot; Shining&#039;s voice trailed off as he entered the room, his attention fully on the mare who stared back at him in utter horror. He didn&#039;t even notice Cadance&#039;s horn glowing briefly, infusing the tableau with a faint cyan aura. Trixie awkwardly clambered out of the rut, giving the alicorn of love a look; Cadance returned it with a sigh, flicking her eyes at her husband and shaking her head.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Shining Armor cleared his throat. &quot;Soooooooooooo. I, uh, take it you&#039;re looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis managed, barely, to nod.</p><p class="double">&quot;O...kay... Well, um, welcome to the loops, I guess...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis took a breath. &quot;This.... this isn&#039;t my, uh, first loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded. &quot;Yeah, I can see how that could work. Take some time to get acclimatized before.... well, meeting somebody who was basically prey.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I don&#039;t.... well, so long as you don&#039;t do it again, I figure the past is the past.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Yes, quite.&quot; Chrysalis nodded. &quot;Yes! Yes, I&#039;ll not be... invading... again. Nope.&quot; She smiled awkwardly, buzzing out of the ditch and landing. &quot;Um. So, uh... nice to meet you! Heh.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed. &quot;You need to tell him.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor looked toward the magician. &quot;Tell me what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039;s horn flared and she popped out of existence. A moment later she popped back into existence and stumbled into a wall.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anti-teleport field,&quot; Cadance explained, tapping her horn. &quot;Chrysalis, this is for your own good, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen glared at her... then turned her gaze toward Trixie. &quot;You... you planned this!&quot; Her eyes were wide and wet with tears of betrayal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... my plan involved rockets,&quot; Trixie admitted sheepishly. &quot;We went with Cadance&#039;s plan... I, uh, may have a small problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">A shaky hole-ridden hoof rose to point at her. &quot;NO SUPERFUN FOR, FOR A MONTH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining blushed. &quot;Did... did she just pull a List Trotter gambit?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, no. Superfun means explosives,&quot; Trixie explained. &quot;Happyfun means--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think that the point has been made!&quot; Cadance shouted. She took a breath, calming herself. &quot;Chrysalis is very upset that we&#039;re forcing this, even if it is for her own good. Anyway, Chrysalis...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just... just give me a moment.&quot; The ebony mare took a few deep, shaky breaths.</p><p class="double">Shining Armor leaned in toward his wife. &quot;Is... is this some sort of addiction intervention? Has she been draining my non awake selves or something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WE WERE MARRIED, OKAY?!&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis buried her head in her hooves. &quot;We were married, Shiny. For eighteen years, and... and that was my first loop. I thought the baseline was a nightmare because, because I, I couldn&#039;t even think of... I didn&#039;t want to think I could be that cruel. Not after fighting... well, the Celestia of that loop. Not after falling in love and freeing slaves... and... and then I woke up in the next loop and it was all a lie.&quot; She moaned. &quot;There you have it. That&#039;s my big secret. Now just... just go.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining stepped forward. &quot;Um, I--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Leave, all of you. Trixie too.&quot; The queen of changelings sighed. &quot;I.... need to be alone right now...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p>40.7</p><p class="double">Celestia carefully unlocked the door to her treasure chamber. “Thank you all for coming,” she said, as the magic released. “I fear that a great evil may have returned, and-”</p><p class="double">She stopped.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked at the ash-strewn ruins within, then she and the others started coughing as thick clouds of smoke erupted out.</p><p class="double">“Dash!” Twilight said, hacking and coughing in the smoke. “Clear this!”</p><p class="double">Dash answered with a pair of wingbeats, thinning the smoke enough to see through, and Twilight added her normal artificial-air-supply spell over the whole group.</p><p class="double">With the smoke clearing, there was a blue glow of magic visible in the air...</p><p class="double">“Trixie?” Rarity, Applejack and Dash asked together.</p><p class="double">“Ah, the Element bearers,” Trixie said, turning. She had Twilight&#039;s Magic tiara on her forehead, and no less than five necklaces on – all the Elements. “Surprised?”</p><p class="double">“Kind of, yeah,” Pinkie said, scratching her head. “I could swear this was supposed to be a <i>new</i> villain...”</p><p class="double">“There probably is.” Trixie tossed her head. “But the security on the Elements was no match for Trixie&#039;s advanced safe-cracking techniques!”</p><p class="double">Twilight sniffed the air, then looked up. “Wait a moment... did you seriously melt a hole in the ceiling?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed!” Trixie answered, pleased. “Iron oxide and Aluminium are excellent tools.”</p><p class="double">“So. Thermite.” Twilight shrugged. “Well, have fun, then.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Celestia asked incredulously, echoed by three of Twilight&#039;s friends. (Fluttershy didn&#039;t say anything, and Pinkie was too busy browsing through a book she&#039;d retrieved from somewhere.)</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed. “Look, if she wants to use the Elements on the new problem, that&#039;s fine.”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s eyes widened. “Trixie might have to <i>use</i> them?”</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah...” Twilight glanced aside at her mentor. “About the only things in history which <i>required</i> the Elements were... ooh... Nightmare Moon and Discord-” Celestia twitched, “and I suspect it&#039;s the latter. So if you want to keep them, keep them – just know that Discord will take them away again in about five minutes.”</p><p class="double">Trixie pondered this for a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“I want to keep the magic one. You can have the rest back.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Celestia said, shocked. “What are you thinking?”</p><p class="double">Twilight stretched. “That it&#039;s my element and I&#039;ll lend it out if I want to, she&#039;s probably the number two magical unicorn in the country, and that I was halfway through a good book. See you guys later.”</p><p class="double">She vanished with a flash.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How&#039;d it go?” Twilight asked, as Trixie walked heavily into the library with her hat askew.</p><p class="double">“Not particularly well,” Trixie admitted. “It looks like the baseline-loop magic show is <i>not</i> compatible with me using the Elements alongside the others. Well,” Trixie waved a hoof. “We got it going eventually. But the palace west wing is probably going to stay as boiled sweets for the rest of the Loop.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight nodded. “Well, it&#039;s good to know this sort of thing. More data points about friendship.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">40.8</p><p class="double">“Okay. Sure.” Chrysalis nodded. “I can do that. I think.”</p><p class="double">“Could you really?” Twilight asked, smiling. “Thanks. Normally I&#039;d be fine with it, it&#039;s just...”</p><p class="double">She tailed off, then tried again. “<i>That</i> loop.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I get the picture.” Chrysalis shifted to match Twilight&#039;s form... then frowned back along her body. “With wings or without? I&#039;ve lost track of if it&#039;s general knowledge you&#039;re a princess this time.”</p><p class="double">“With.” Twilight winced. “I lost track myself at the loop-start, and Sparkler saw me with them. I told her it was an accident and to keep it secret, which means that only Canterlot high society knows...”</p><p class="double">“Right, right.” More faint green light, and the Twilight-double had wings. “How&#039;s that?”</p><p class="double">“Looks good.” Twilight nodded. “<i>Shrub</i>, but that gala would have been awkward.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure.” Chrysalis turned in place, still looking back along her borrowed form. “Hey, I just noticed. Your hair doesn&#039;t have a... thing.”</p><p class="double">“You mean an aura?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“If I knew what an aura was, then I might be able to answer that...”</p><p class="double">Twilight summoned her element of magic and ascended in the same instant. “This.”</p><p class="double">Slowly, her mane began to glow with a soft orange light. The colour striping along it seemed to blur, slightly, and then become bands of backlit shadow.</p><p class="double">They looked like nothing less than two banks of cloud between sky and land, lit by a sun that had just set below the horizon. The angle of the light changed as she moved, never quite still.</p><p class="double">“...okay, that&#039;s cool.” Chrysalis turned her head on its side. “I think I get it. Twilight, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah...” Twilight shrugged, and then her mane was just coloured again. “It kind of attracts attention, though... and I&#039;m conspicuous enough already with wings.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; copy of Twilight&#039;s mane lit up. “Gah, that&#039;s hard to copy. Can any of the others do that?”</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah...” Twilight answered. “We&#039;re old enough and have enough power. But I usually see them in the more recent Sisters loops, because that way we at least have a reason to use them.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, now I&#039;m curious.” Chrysalis frowned. “Aren&#039;t most of the others awake this loop? I kind of want to see.”</p><p class="double">“...sure.” Twilight went from alicorn to pegasus, then slapped a glamour on herself which made her cutie mark a nebula. “You may as well use the chance to practise being me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, <i>that</i>,” Dash said with a shrug. “Yeah, use it all the time.”</p><p class="double">“You do?” Twilight blinked. “I&#039;d thought it was a rare thing...”</p><p class="double">“Well, sort of, yeah, but who&#039;s going to be able to tell when I&#039;m moving at supersonic speed anyway? Besides, it looks cool.” Dash ascended, then her mane began to...</p><p class="double">Finding words was hard. It was still the same rainbow of colours, and none of them moved, but it was as though one was looking at something going past at extreme speed parallel to the directions of the lines.</p><p class="double">“...that is giving me a headache,” Chrysalis commented absently.</p><p class="double">“Just go with it,” Dash tossed her head, and the colours... reacted after the mane itself, briefly resulting in a mane that was almost entirely red.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said brightly, tapping the facsimile of her shoulder. “Next?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they flew back down to Ponyville, Chrysalis looked Twilight&#039;s glamour over. “That looks fairly detailed. Standard form?”</p><p class="double">“Yes.” Twilight nodded, backwinging a little. “Starry Nights, a pegasus who goes stargazing on cirrus clouds at night. I made up a few of these one loop, for just this sort of thing.”</p><p class="double">“I approve,” Chrysalis said. “It feels less... impolite, taking a form you have permission for, and invented forms automatically result in permission. I have one who likes collecting rocks...”</p><p class="double">With a clatter of hooves, they landed in front of Carousel Botique.</p><p class="double">“And this is my friend Rarity&#039;s house,” Chrysalis added, knocking.</p><p class="double">After some muffled cursing and a loud <i>splash</i> noise, the door opened on a rather damp Rarity.</p><p class="double">“Oh, come in, Twilight,” Rarity said, her eyes flicking to the pegasus as she said the name. “Who&#039;s your friend?”</p><p class="double">“Starry Nights,” Chrysalis replied easily. “I met her at an astronomy meeting a few days ago.”</p><p class="double">As the door closed again, Twilight nodded to Chrysalis. “Very smooth.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Chrysalis replied with a nod.</p><p class="double">“So, what brings you two here?” Rarity asked, summoning a mop from the back room with her telekinesis and clearing off the floor. “Sorry about this, by the way, my attempt at creating a hat with fish in is still pending a stable but non-stasis containment spell for water in cloth form.”</p><p class="double">“Chrysalis is curious about our mane auras.” Twilight shrugged. “It&#039;s an opportunity to practise being me around town, as well.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that thing.” Rarity rolled her eyes. “That <i>does</i> look nice, but it <i>does</i> also force me into a very limited style of clothing. But I suppose you&#039;d like to see it, of course.”</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s mane aura was, as was becoming a theme, very different to that of anypony else. Where Twilight&#039;s had shone, and Dash&#039;s had flickered, Rarity&#039;s mane... refracted.</p><p class="double">It was see-through, though a deep purple in colour. But what you saw through it didn&#039;t match the edges up with what was visible past it. And when it moved, the whole thing acted like a funhouse mirror and distorted in unpredictable ways.</p><p class="double">“So, there it is,” Rarity said, before undoing the aura and going back to unicorn. “It&#039;s like I&#039;m wearing a giant, flexible gemstone – which doesn&#039;t work well if I want to wear a lot of colours. More colours do well <i>with</i> purple than do well <i>tinted</i> purple, and of course I can&#039;t mute the colouring of it with a well-done hairstyle either.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. “I see. So they... what, they reflect the magical signature of the pony?”</p><p class="double">“Partially,” Twilight replied. “But that&#039;s not the whole story. Let&#039;s go see Pinkie.”</p><p class="double">“...do we have to? I&#039;m still digesting the last Genocide By Toffee, and that was five loops ago...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Ta-da!” Pinkie said, shaking her pink curls. “Like it?”</p><p class="double">“...but that&#039;s just your normal mane-style, isn&#039;t it?” Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. With the air of one doing a magic trick, she ran her hoof along the edge of the mane.</p><p class="double">Some of it came off.</p><p class="double">“Here, try it,” Twilight offered. “It&#039;s delicious.”</p><p class="double">Tentatively, Chrysalis took a small portion with a spoon, and tasted it experimentally.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what.” The disguised changeling pointed, licking the spoon. “Your mane is literally cotton candy.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie beamed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s see...” Twilight said, as they came down to land outside Sweet Apple Acres. “Applejack next, then Fluttershy – Trixie&#039;s there as well, I think, so we can do her too – then we teleport to Canterlot to call in on Shiny and Cadence and finish up with my daughter.”</p><p class="double">“Do we have to do your brother?” Chrysalis winced. “I mean...”</p><p class="double">“I know.” Twilight laid a wing across Chrysalis&#039; back. “If you want, I&#039;ll ask them to do it and you can look in from outside. But they <i>are</i> important.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll-” Chrysalis swallowed. “I&#039;ll give it a go.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the spirit. Oh, hi, Applejack. I&#039;m showing Chrysalis all our mane auras.”</p><p class="double">The farm-pony nodded to both of them. “I&#039;m expectin&#039; you&#039;ll want to see mine, then?”</p><p class="double">“Please.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Applejack stamped on the ground, which produced a ripple and made the nearest field plough itself instantly. “Take a look, then.”</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s alicorn mode was the largest of all the Element bearers&#039;, when shapechanging magic or sheer age wasn&#039;t coming into the equation, and her mane was entirely in scale. After a moment, it took on the slightly unearthly quality which Chrysalis was starting to notice all mane auras had.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s... very yellow, actually,” Chrysalis said, walking all around Applejack. “Or... hold on, is the colour changing?”</p><p class="double">“It cycles through,” Twilight explained helpfully. “Applejack tends not to use hers because it actually changes her colouration – which is very obvious. It goes from yellow to red, then back through yellow to green. Apple colours.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, thank you.”</p><p class="double">Applejack took that as the okay to revert to her base form. “Right, where was ah... oh, yeah. Potatoes.”</p><p class="double">“New thing?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Ah heard th&#039; Prench called &#039;em pommes de terre,” Applejack said over her shoulder. “Worth a try.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That&#039;s really strange,” Chrysalis said, watching the pink shapes move over one another. “Are those butterflies or leaves?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shook her head, causing the shapes to shuffle around more vigorously. “I think it depends how you look.”</p><p class="double">“My turn!” Trixie said, her magic-circlet materializing on her brow. A flash of light, a puff of smoke, and she too was an alicorn.</p><p class="double">“Trixie&#039;s mane is a bit like Fluttershy&#039;s,” Twilight commented. “See the flashes?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t... wait, there we are.” Chrysalis squinted. “Like tiny little fireworks.”</p><p class="double">Trixie spun with a flourish, sending her mane flying out behind her – in a crescendo of bright, multicoloured light.</p><p class="double">“There we go,” Twilight said, smiling. “The faster she moves, the larger the flashes get – and they take on different colours, too.”</p><p class="double">“If only Trixie could get this to work without the wings,” Trixie said sadly. “That would be an excellent magic show.”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to Chrysalis. “Ready?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed. “...as I&#039;ll ever be.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, long story short, she&#039;s borrowing my form and she wanted to find out about how alicorn manes work,” Twilight said, keeping an eye on the pair&#039;s reactions.</p><p class="double">“Well, that sounds fine,” Shining said, looking a little uncomfortably at the faux-alicorn. Chrysalis shuffled her wings, and stepped back a bit. “That is <i>so</i> strange... she&#039;s even got your mannerisms down...”</p><p class="double">“The mane?” Twilight prompted.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Shining slipped his hoof into his subspace pocket, touched his spectrum crystal pendant, and flashed through an ascension.</p><p class="double">“Watch this,” Twilight said. Taking a comb from the dresser, she made to comb her brothers&#039; mane.</p><p class="double">With a <i>tink</i>, the comb bounced off.</p><p class="double">“Coherent forcefield,” she said with a wink. “Bit of a pain, though, because stallions find it harder to get away with a useful length of mane.”</p><p class="double">“And as for mine...” Cadence waved a hoof through her mane, which billowed and parted before reforming into the same curls as before. “Try to hold it and it&#039;s as tenuous as smoke. Leave it alone and it always comes back. Sort of like love, really.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, thanks.” Twilight turned to Chrysalis. “Can you teleport us back? Remember the horn aura ultraviolet spell, the fake horn aura spell, and the teleport as well.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Chrysalis frowned. “Let me know if it works.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Yeah, I hardly <i>ever</i> use mine,” Nyx said, looking back at her mane and tail.</p><p class="double">“Why?” Chrysalis asked. “What does it do?”</p><p class="double">“Nothing.”</p><p class="double">“...well, how-”</p><p class="double">“No,” Nyx blew her mane out of her eyes. “Literally nothing. Watch.”</p><p class="double">Mane and tail both went black.</p><p class="double">Completely black. Not just raven-black. Not even coal-black.</p><p class="double">Hole-in-space black. The black of the cold between the stars. So black that your eyes could tell that not a single photon of light was either coming from or being reflected from the hair in question.</p><p class="double">And then Nyx&#039;s mane was back to a dark purple colour.</p><p class="double">“So, yeah,” she said, shrugging. “Depressing.”</p><p class="double">“Right.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sat back to absorb that.</p><p class="double">After a few minutes, another question came to her. “Why are Celestia and Luna so similar, then? In their auras, I mean?”</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s because they&#039;re sisters, and because both of them have talents and magic associated directly with the light of celestial bodies.” Twilight half-spread her wings, then furled them. “I&#039;m not sure, of course, because a lot of this is based on observation, and if you find the definitive book on alicorn magic then please lend it to me as soon as possible.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>41.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, what.”</p><p class="double">Trixie grinned. “Like it? It&#039;s art!”</p><p class="double">Twilight rubbed her forehead with a hoof. “That&#039;s <i>not</i> art. That&#039;s a disaster slowly happening.”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s newest project sat between them. It was a metal framework about two lengths long and one high, with a cloud of finely-divided shrapnel and gas hanging as though frozen around the object inside it.</p><p class="double">“But it&#039;s cool!” Trixie pointed. “See, the lenses have fired, and the compression wave should reach the neutron-reflective core in another few minutes. When it does, the whole of the plutonium will crash through fission in just ten seconds, and-”</p><p class="double">Twilight <i>eep</i>ed. She grabbed the whole device and threw it violently upwards.</p><p class="double">“Awww...” Trixie raised a hoof plaintively towards the hole in the ceiling. “It took me weeks to transmute all that plutonium.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “While your interest in explosives is normally merely dangerous, that was just stupid. But, more importantly-”</p><p class="double">A star bloomed above for a moment.</p><p class="double">“...yeah, that,” Twilight finished. “Pro tip: stasis enchantments set like that may slow down what&#039;s inside them, but the gamma ray effect of the blast destroyed the material on which the enchantments were set in the first place...”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s jaw hung slack.</p><p class="double">“What were you planning to do with it, anyway?” Twilight added.</p><p class="double">“...I really screwed up,” Trixie admitted. “Sorry, Twilight. And I had been planning on putting it in orbit in another few months, but... yeah, that would have gone badly.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I&#039;m sorry, but you really kind of did mess up. Okay, I won&#039;t ask for a friendship report on this one, because Celestia might actually get violent if you tell her you nearly nuked part of the western desert. But I will insist that you use nothing more substantial than a Major Image for the next few loops.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha.” Trixie shook her head, shivering. Then she looked up, forcing a smile. “I suppose I <i>have</i> been relying on brute force a bit...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.2</p><p class="double">“Ah, that&#039;s the stuff...” Spike sighed, finishing off the tumbler of crushed opal in water.</p><p class="double">Just right to cool you off after a long, hot summer day. (Well, if you were a dragon, anyway.)</p><p class="double">Rarity slid onto the stool next to him. “Hello, stranger.”</p><p class="double">“Stranger still,” he replied, turning to her. “Did you escape the ravening horde, then?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, they took themselves off to the lake. Something about going boating.” Rarity shrugged. “They should be fine, they took four sets of that armour I made – with the contingent teleportation spell.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Good to hear. Hey, Mac? Something ponies can drink, large, and two straws.”</p><p class="double">“Coming up,” Mac replied, getting to work.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You four are just <i>nuts,</i>” Nyx said, shaking her head. “And how long did it take you to build these things anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Not important!” Diamond Tiara replied. “Steam up?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Apple bloom nodded, holding up a small stone. “Fire stone – they&#039;re used for camp fires. One large bag under each boiler, and they&#039;ll put out heat until tomorrow morning.”</p><p class="double">As she spoke, steam indeed began to ooze up from the four vessels moored nearby.</p><p class="double">Sweetie hadn&#039;t <i>quite</i> lied when she said they were going boating, when Rarity asked – but the more correct term would be <i>shipping.</i></p><p class="double">Or perhaps not.</p><p class="double">“Right, mine is the<i> Thunder Child</i>,” Tiara said, stepping briskly to the gangplank and walking up.</p><p class="double">The others spread out, heading to their own ships, and Nyx took to the air wearing a large striped referee&#039;s saddle.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Two hours later, as the sun hung past zenith over the deserted archipelago between Equestria and the Gryphon Lands, they were all in position. Each was at the corner of an imaginary square, ten miles on a side.</p><p class="double">Nyx double-checked the cloud solidity effect on her referee&#039;s platform, then fired off the first spell.</p><p class="double">On the bridges of four capital ships, the word “begin” drifted out of the air.</p><p class="double">Sweetie&#039;s <i>Ocean</i> kicked things off, heeling over with the muzzle-horsepower of four 12-inch guns and six 6-inch guns as she fired a volley towards Scootaloo&#039;s <i>Agamemnon.</i></p><p class="double">Then things got quite loud, as all four battlewagons began beating the snot out of one another.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx winced. “Ouch...”</p><p class="double">With a bright flash, Scootaloo appeared next to her. “Aw, that sucks. Apple Bloom&#039;s totally cheating.”</p><p class="double">“How so?” Nyx looked down, at the pillar of smoke marking <i>Agamemnon</i>&#039;s pyre and the other three huge ships dodging and exchanging fire.</p><p class="double">“Her ship&#039;s <i>faster</i> than mine, <i>better armed</i> than mine, and I think she put more armour on it as well.” Scootaloo shook her head. “I saw some of my twelve-inchers splash off the armour.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle appeared in another flash of magic. She landed on the cloud, bounced slightly, and checked with her hoof that it was indeed solid before taking the teleport-strap off. “So much for mine...”</p><p class="double">A loud <i>bang</i> came up to them.</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Scootaloo mused, as <i>Ocean</i> sank in two halves. “Looks like a magazine hit. That ship of &#039;Bloom&#039;s...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tiara&#039;s ship weaved through plumes of water and smoke, taking the occasional hit from the ten huge 12-inchers Apple Bloom was firing in broadside.</p><p class="double">On the bridge, Tiara slammed the enchanted engine-room telegraph to full ahead, checked her positioning, and kicked the torpedo release control with a certain satisfaction.</p><p class="double">Quick-firing guns depressed to shoot at the torpedo sprays, and Apple Bloom&#039;s <i>Dreadnought</i> turned to present a small target to them.</p><p class="double">That was fine by Tiara&#039;s merits. After all, the only place where the torpedoes would miss was-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A final huge explosion rippled the cloud layer.</p><p class="double">Both earth pony fillies appeared within a quarter second of one another, and landed in a heap.</p><p class="double">“Who won?” Tiara demanded, wriggling out from under Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">Nyx frowned. “I think it was probably you, Tiara. I mean, <i>Dreadnought</i> blew up before <i>Thunder Child</i> – if only because you pierced the boiler with the ram.”</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Tiara did a little dance. “Told you it was a useful design!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah...” Apple Bloom huffed. “The torpedo ram <i>is</i> effective under the right circumstances.”</p><p class="double">“Say it!” Tiara demanded.</p><p class="double">“Fine...” Apple Bloom took a breath. “You sunk my battleship.”</p><p class="double">Tiara made a squee sound.</p><p class="double">“So...” Nyx took in the floating wreckage, the three pillars of smoke, and the sinking remains of the last two battlewagons. “Can we get this cleared up before one of the others comes looking for us, or do we hope that the loop resets and removes the evidence before someone notices?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.3 (TheCentauress)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The eight-limbed Spirit Animal trotted over to his Admin Console and looked at his stand-in. &quot;&#039;Zup?&quot; he asked with a happy smile.</p><p class="double">Bastet gave the approaching fellow Admin a hoof/paw/manipulating-appendage/whatever-bump. &quot;Love the group you have here,&quot; she replied to him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh?&quot; he enquired interrogatively.</p><p class="double">The feline-leaning goddess giggled. &quot;Well, see...&quot; she managed around her mirth, &quot;there was this thing... and then...&quot; she gave up and pointed at the terminal.</p><p class="double">The divine equine took a look and saw what was funny...</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight sat there, staring at her paws, trying to figure out <i>what the fluff</i> happened.</p><p class="double">Spike hemmed, hawwed and generally tried to come up with anything. &quot;Ah, you look good as a cat?&quot; the youngling purple dragon finally tried, lamely.</p><p class="double"><i>Thank the Spruce he&#039;s Awake, at least,</i> she mused. &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure this is...&quot; she began before the Loop memories hit. &quot;Urrrk,&quot; she added intelligently, &quot;Great fuzzy yarnballs! Who made this Felinia? Housecats, Kittyhawks and PHASE-cats? Buh-wha?&quot; The last was due to her own feeler-arms unwinding in front of her muzzle in her agitation.</p><p class="double">Spike too one look and headed out the door. &quot;If you need me, I&#039;m going to be drowning my sorrows at the nearest Diamond Dog burrow,&quot; he muttered as the door swung closed.</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Sleppnir looked up at Bastet and snickered. &quot;Redo, but their morphic base being feline rather than equine?&quot; He chuckled at her answering bobble-head nod. &quot;Well, they do need to prepare for some of the &#039;odder&#039; non-Eiken stuff, I suppose...” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.4 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Rarity had long ago developed a habit of acquiring samples of intriguing materials whenever she was Awake. As a result, the Carousel Boutique&#039;s basement boasted a rather impressive material science lab and a dwarven magma forge retrofitted to work with alicorn magic. (Also, the Boutique had a basement. A little sorcery went a long way.)</p><p class="double">It was here where Rarity, in pursuit of a goal that had eluded her for countless Loops, discovered that Oerth adamantine and Earth-616 adamantium were far more different than their names would suggest. The former was a pure metal, but the latter was an alloy. Indeed, adamantine was closer to one of adamantium&#039;s ingredients, Vibranium. The two were still distinct from one another, and that was exactly what Rarity had been hoping to find.</p><p class="double">After almost two weeks of near-nonstop metallurgy and countless formulae, Rarity produced a promising sliver of material. It almost sang with stability in her field, even when molten. Once it cooled, it had a curious ocean blue hue, and proved unmalleable by any force of less than continent-shifting magnitude. Thus, the mare proudly dubbed her creation &quot;tectonium.&quot;</p><p class="double">Still, it needed to be put through its paces. Rarity crafted a needle of tectonium and began the battery of tests she&#039;d devised at the start of the enterprise. It went through titanium as easily as through soft cheese. It scratched a diamond like a stylus writing on wet clay. It could even be telekinetically hammered through both of its principal constituents and one of Spike&#039;s larger shed scales to boot, all with minimal wear and tear.</p><p class="double">Rarity beamed. &quot;It&#039;s perfect! I shall get to work straight away.&quot; She began focusing magic into the forge. She&#039;d need much more than a needle&#039;s worth for what she had planned. &quot;But it will all be worth it,&quot; she told herself. &quot;It&#039;s sure to work!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Why! Won&#039;t! You! Work! You! Stupid! Thing!?&quot; With every word, Rarity sent her creation careening through the air and anything else that got in the way.</p><p class="double">As such, Shining Armor kept on the other side of his Canterlot office, well away from the mare. &quot;Rarity, it really isn&#039;t important. I—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is <i>vitally</i> important!&quot; Rarity turned on the stallion, who realized too late how foolish it had been to draw her attention. &quot;I will not, neigh, <i>can</i> not allow Equestria&#039;s sole male alicorn to present himself as anything less than the ultimate gentestallion!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining sighed as he released his aura, his mane and tail reverting from impenetrable force to mundane hair. &quot;So I can comb my mane like this. It really isn&#039;t—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is the <i>principle</i> of the thing!&quot; Rarity ranted. &quot;Celestia does not subject her hoofmaidens to that pink mop of hers. Luna did not permit her mundane locks to remain any longer than necessary. Allowing your mane to be styled at anything less than its full regal splendor is a miscarriage of fabulosity!&quot;</p><p class="double">A unicorn-turned-alicorn mare was ranting at Shining Armor. He could be forgiven for trying to appeal to logic. &quot;That only applies if I&#039;m reigning Prince of Equestria, which has happened all of four times.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you need to be prepared for the fifth! But this useless piece of…&quot; Rarity gave an incoherent scream and threw the tectonium comb at the window. It missed, but went through the wall with minimal speed loss.</p><p class="double">Shining snared it just before it flew out of sight. &quot;You&#039;re lucky nopony was in its path,&quot; he noted as his magic dragged the comb back at a more reasonable velocity.</p><p class="double">Rarity sulked. &quot;I just wanted you to look like a proper prince, is all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, if nothing else, you&#039;ve made one of the most impressive alloys I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot; Shining opened the window to let the comb drift back inside. &quot;I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;d take a commission from the Guard armory?&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a sigh. Rarity didn&#039;t even feel up to summoning a fainting couch. &quot;No thank you. If you&#039;d like, I&#039;ll give you the formula, but…&quot; She groaned. &quot;I was just so sure it would work this time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, if nothing can get through my mane, I&#039;m pretty sure nothing can mess it up, either.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve had bad mane days as an alicorn, Shining.&quot; Rarity shuddered at the memories. &quot;Believe me, you <i>will</i> want some way of dealing with them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining just let his aura come and go in response. &quot;At least I don&#039;t have a pink mop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity did not snort at this. A lady does not snort when she laughs. And she had a row of very sharp teeth on hoof for anypony who might claim otherwise. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.5 (bobnik)</p><p class="double">&quot;... to which I replied, &#039;The clothes aren&#039;t matter.&#039; Of course, with my rusty grasp of Mayan, suddenly Cortez was faced with a nation of nudists when he arrived.&quot; finished Rarity.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle fell off her chair laughing. When Loopers got together to play &quot;What&#039;s the oddest....&quot; the results were either hilarious, tragic or more frequently both.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your turn.&quot; said Rarity. &quot;What&#039;s the oddest thing you&#039;ve ever said that had the furthest-reaching effects?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm. Furthest-reaching? That would be the time I founded a sub-cult of a religion that lasted for ten thousand years.&quot; replied Sweetie. &quot;Hold on a sec, I have to get in costume so you get the full effect.&quot; She hurried into one of the change rooms in the showroom area of Carousel Boutique, and Rarity felt the brief whisper of magic that meant her younger sister was using her subspace pocket. &quot;So did you know I was Awake in the 40K loop when Pinkie ascended?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, really? I hope you didn&#039;t get caught up in all that &#039;eternal war&#039;.&quot; said Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course not, didn&#039;t you hear? Pinkie Pie became an entity that didn&#039;t even have to pretend to obey causality. There was no eternal war. Sure, they started up and then BAM! Orbital party support, Eldar Disco Banshees, Shindigmonettes, the works. So in that Loop I was a Space Marine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Wait, aren&#039;t they always male? That must have been distressing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well yeah. This was fairly early on in the loops for me, and the first time I was male, let alone an adult. Luckily they&#039;re all, well, chemically neutered. So I plain didn&#039;t have to worry about it.&quot; said Sweetie. Her voice became muffled, as if she&#039;d put something on her head. &quot;So there we were start of the Great Crusade. Me and my squad had been given some experimental weaponry and we were part of the pacification force for a world called Lestethes. We landed as per the plan, and started making a base camp, when the scouts report we&#039;re surrounded. Out from cover pops half a million Eldar, and Pinkamena Diane Pie, Festival Incarnate, Warp Goddess of the Eternal Party descended unto us from on high. Then they all yelled &#039;Surprise!&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, yes, classic Pinkie. Even so, it must have been a sight to behold.&quot; Rarity made a circling motion with her hoof. &quot;Go on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So there&#039;s this long awkward silence. The Space Marines of that time had been raised to believe that any alien always was and always would be their enemy. Pinkie&#039;s hair was just starting to straighten out when I decided I wasn&#039;t going to let that happen. I hadn&#039;t been to a Pinkie Party for about fifty years by then, and no way was I going to let this one get away. So I stood up out of cover, fired up the blastmaster, and yelled...&quot;</p><p class="double">At this point Sweetie burst out of the change booth, dressed head to tail in strange pink armour. It had giant shoulder pads, a huge amplifier on the back and a balloon motif repeated all over it. Sweetie reared up on her hind hooves and hoisted a strange guitar looking thing before letting loose her warcry:</p><p class="double">&quot;THIS QUIET OFFENDS PINKIE! THINGS SHALL GET LOUD NOW!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.6 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You are our trusted elites. As such, we have a trusted elite mission for you,&quot; said the tall green floating alien with the red eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a very important mission!&quot; agreed the other tall green alien with the violet eyes that floated alongside the first one, &quot;The important-est kind of mission.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I hear and obey, my Tallests,&quot; Twilight said as her memories of this loop came rushing in. She blinked at the oddness of it all. A check on Elements showed that her friends were all awake, as well as Celestia and Luna. And they were all green aliens. Irkquestrians.</p><p class="double">&quot;To that end, we have crafted specialized SIR robot units for you all,&quot; said Tallest Cel, &quot;Invader Twi, as my personal protigee, I give you this modified SIR unit, codenamed Spike. His specialty is FTL communication.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can also set things on fire with my plasma breath of doom!&quot; A green and purple small metallic robot said as he walked in, adding, &quot;I also eat shiny rocks for fuel. Just thought I&#039;d mention that; hint, hint.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Tallest Lun said while staring at the odd robot, &quot;The new modified SIRs may be a little... quirky, but they are fully functional. FULLY FUNCTIONAL!&quot;</p><p class="double">The royal Irkquestrian voice knocked every alien backwards.</p><p class="double">Tallest Cel continued, unfazed, &quot;Invader Jac, you get the SIR unit codenamed Winona. Specialty is tracking and guidance.&quot;</p><p class="double">The orange eyed invader looked at her new robot. It looked pretty much like every other SIR unit. &quot;Well, howdy, little one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi!&quot; The SIR unit said in a high pitched eager female voice, &quot;I can&#039;t wait to go on this mission. Maybe.. maybe I can even wear a doggy suit?&quot;</p><p class="double">Invader Jac nodded, &quot;We&#039;ll work something out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tallest Cel motioned over the next elite invader, &quot;Invader Rare, you get SIR unit Opal.&quot;</p><p class="double">The all white robot sauntered in and looked over her new mistress, &quot;What can you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll have you know that my weapon designs and invasion plans are the most elegant anywhere,&quot; Invader Rare huffed.</p><p class="double">Opal nodded, &quot;I suppose you&#039;ll do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Invader Shy, since you&#039;re so... timid, we&#039;ve matched you with an appropriate SIR unit, codenamed Angel,&quot; the co-leader said.</p><p class="double">Invader Shy was one of the tallest invaders - which was how they measured status on the planet – but her shy and caring nature was at direct odds to most of the other Irkquestrians. Still, she made for an excellent medic and science officer, &quot;Oh my, he sounds delightful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;His specialty is..,&quot; Tallest Cel was suddenly interrupted when a small SIR unit came through the door - as in ripped right through the advanced metal in a fit of rage. He landed in the center of the aliens, roared, and ripped out a chunk of the floor. He raised it over his head and shook it angrily before biting it into tiny bits with his jagged razor sharp robot teeth.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was wrong,&quot; Invader Shy said quietly, &quot;He&#039;s even more adorable than I thought he would be!&quot;</p><p class="double">Said alien grabbed the omnicidal robot and hugged him in a caring, yet restraining hug while cooing over her new assistant.</p><p class="double">&quot;Invader Pie,&quot; Tallest Lun sighed as said invader appeared suddenly inches in front of her. </p><p class="double">&quot;Yesssss?&quot; said the pink-outfit wearing blue-eyed invader.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here&#039;s your SIR unit, codenamed Gummy.&quot;</p><p class="double">A small greenish robot walked out calmly towards his new mistress.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you like parties?&quot;</p><p class="double">The robot just looked at Invader Pie. His large eye sensors blinked one after the other.</p><p class="double">&quot;Awesome! Let&#039;s have one right now! To the spaceship storage container bin hanger thing! Alien Space Party!&quot; The two vanished in a flash.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Tallest Cel said to the last invader without a robot. She was hovering in the air as well using a makeshift jetpack that was attached to her backpack-like life support unit, &quot;Finally, Invader Dash. You get the one codenamed Tank.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alien leader pointed to the wrecked door. The aliens started at it as nothing came out. A moment passed. Then the wall next to it collapsed as a truly gigantic SIR unit strode in.</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s... so... awesome!&quot; Invader Dash exclaimed and zoomed towards her new assistant.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, my Tallests! My Tallests! I have... a QUESTION!,&quot; Twilight spoke up while gesturing with one upraised fist. She was wondering if everyone in this loop was a giant ham, &quot;What exactly IS our mission?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yeah. That,&quot; Tallest Cel said, &quot;You see, a while back, we sent our most destructive invader to a distant dirt ball named Earth.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We had hoped that the sheer amount of STUPID on that planet would contain him,&quot; Tallest Lun added, &quot;Or at least keep him busy enough not to bother us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s pretty much the definition of containment,&quot; Tallest Cel told her co-ruler.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, we know this. But even still, Invader... ZIM,&quot; the raw anger and loathing at the mere mention of his name was palpable, &quot;managed to destroy a full quarter of our invasion fleet with an out of control MOTILE PLANET!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And even with such looses, it is still an improvement over what he did to our Operation Impending Doom one. So much fire. How crazy is that?&quot; Tallest Cel asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty crazy,&quot; Tallest Lun answered, &quot;Anyway, you six are our elites. So it is up to you to prevent him from causing anymore problems. Do it! Do eeet!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right away, my Tallests!&quot; Twilight hopped on a hovering Spike, and together they took off towards the ship hanger.</p><p class="double">Tallest Cel looked over at her co-ruler, &quot;This is a very strange loop. You think they have a chance?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh? Good question,&quot; Tallest Lun said, &quot;but I don&#039;t care. I&#039;m going to go eat snacks and play video games. Want to join me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And have a vacation loop?&quot; her co-ruler said happily as they floated too into their chambers, &quot;You know it!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Please, Twilight?” Trixie begged.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">“Pleeeease?”</p><p class="double">“No. And no to the next one!”</p><p class="double">“But I have graphs!” Trixie brandished a sheaf of papers. “And calculations! And cited sources and everything!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned. “Okay, go on. Show me your working.”</p><p class="double">“Glad to!” Trixie happily laid the papers on a nearby table and pulled up a chair.</p><p class="double">“This is no guarantee that I&#039;ll let you, remember...” Twilight cautioned.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know...” Trixie shrugged, shuffling the papers. “Right. Here we are. Step one: device scale.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...and finally, step forty-three: the shields are made selectively permeable, permitting target to drop from within the outer shield bubble to the outer world. After this, the remaining contents of the shield are launched on a trajectory straight to the heart of the sun.”</p><p class="double">“Demonstrate the shield marked type IV, please,” Twilight requested.</p><p class="double">Trixie flashed to Alicorn, her wand-device Element on her brow, and <i>focused.</i></p><p class="double">A bubble of darkness bloomed out from a point between them. Twilight directed a half dozen spells at it, followed by a large industrial laser and finally a lascannon.</p><p class="double">None of them so much as got through enough light to see.</p><p class="double">“Right. That seems adequate, so long as the polarization scheme followed in appendix c is followed.” Twilight nodded. “Anchor points?”</p><p class="double">“Shield is anchored to itself, and treats the core of the planet and two nearby mountains as fixed points. The top of the shields are all slightly weaker than one another, ensuring that a vent would be along the line of least potential damage.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight took a deep breath. “Go ahead.”</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s grin lit the room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...will last forever!” Nightmare Moon finished.</p><p class="double">Trixie raised a hoof from the audience. “Hay.”</p><p class="double">“You question your liege?” the dark alicorn asked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, just wondering... how do you feel about sunlight in a can?”</p><p class="double">“This has been created?” Nightmare Moon looked a bit unsettled. “Demonstrate.”</p><p class="double">“Since you asked so nicely...” Trixie levitated a large metal cylinder over. The top of it&nbsp;&nbsp;was peaked, and it massed about as much as a torso.</p><p class="double">“How is this operated?” the alicorn queried.</p><p class="double">At that point, Trixie activated some shield layers. Layers one, two and three were around the object at close range, enclosing it at a radius of about four feet.</p><p class="double">Layers four to six were around the object, Nightmare Moon, and a little of the stage.</p><p class="double">Letting her illusion fade, Trixie revealed her wings and shining Element. “A spark shall awaken them.”</p><p class="double">“What? Treachery!” Nightmare Moon&#039;s voice came oddly muffled by the shield layers. “What sorcery encloses <i>me</i> in darkness?” There was a crackle. “My teleportation is hampered! Release me at once!”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t look directly at the blast,” Trixie quipped. “Initiation of device in two, one...”</p><p class="double">From outside, there was an almost anticlimatic flash, a little like a lightbulb burning out.</p><p class="double">As per her meticulous action plan, the showpony allowed a badly singed Nightmare Moon to fall through the bottom of the shield before carefully disposing of the rest of the contents. In the sun.</p><p class="double">“That, basically,” she said with a nod. “I&#039;ve got fun size packs, too.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Out of curiosity, how are you going to make sure that an atomic artillery shell will still initiate around Discord?” Twilight asked, watching with some trepedation as Trixie refreshed a device core.</p><p class="double">Inside an antiradiation shield, of course. Trixie wasn&#039;t stupid. Sometimes.</p><p class="double">“Not sure,” Trixie admitted. “I did think of painting it green, because that way if it fails at least I&#039;ll turn into The Hulk or something.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.8 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight awoke next to Applejack as they both sat around a large utilitarian table. The gunmetal gray walls and sparse decorations indicated that they were on board a ship - possibly a spaceship or submarine of some sort.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Applejack said, &quot;this all doesn&#039;t seem too bad, I recon. The memories should be retur.. oh, HAY NO!&quot;</p><p class="double">The orange pony&#039;s eyes widened even as her pupils shrunk. Twilight shortly knew why when the memories hit.</p><p class="double">Her and the element of honesty were brought on as consultants. Apparently a new pony mining colony had stopped reporting in. Applejack was to check on the status of the terraforming process, ecosystem, and tectonic stability; while she was there to help if any other more esoteric problems show up.</p><p class="double">They had just achieved orbit.</p><p class="double">And the cause of Applejack&#039;s problems, the captain of the ship and leader of the contingent of marines, had just walked into the room - flanked by ten more of the armored marine troops.</p><p class="double">The heavy armor somewhat resembled a mechanical centaur - with a large pony-style body with hard points that held an assortment of very heavy weaponry. The arms were long metallic tentacles that culminated in three long manipulator tendrils that could easily grasp around a pony&#039;s head. And in middle of the body, where the torso and head should have been; was a giant water-filled orb.</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome all you happy campers,&quot; marine captain Sealight merrily exclaimed from inside her orb. Twilight could make out that besides the grinning captain, there was also a tiny little castle and fake treasure chest on the bottom of it, &quot;I&#039;m sure this mission will be so much fun! Two weeks ago, the colony of Oreagon 12 stopped sending out any news or progress reports, so Princess Celestia called upon us seapony marines to look into it. We also have fun ponies Twilight Sparkle and Applejack to help us find out what happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a chorus of wet splashing sounds as all the marines did the seapony version of applause. Applejack&#039;s eye started twitching. Twilight examined the captain. She was the same shade of lavender as herself, but her mane was pale pink in color. The unicorn wondered if the reason seapony armor had so many limbs was because, not having any of their own, the seaponies were fascinated by them.</p><p class="double">The captain turned towards Celestia&#039;s student and continued, &quot;Miss Twilight, can you please scan the colony too see how many ponies are there, playing a rousing game of hide and seek no doubt.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right,&quot; Twilight said as she concentrated on a scrying spell. The distance to the planet from the ship was no great obstacle for her, &quot;Hold on. let me double check the results.&quot;</p><p class="double">The results came back the same. Twilight replied sadly, &quot;There&#039;s only one pony still down there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you could, please bring that pony up to the ship so they won&#039;t be lonely anymore,&quot; Sealight requested.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded and one burst of teleportation later, a dirty earth pony filly was suddenly crouched on the table. A quick calming spell stopped the screaming.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there! What&#039;s your name?&quot; Sealight asked, &quot;Do you know what happened to all the other ponies?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, my name is Newt. And the other ponies... there were these horrible monsters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Righty then. High Tide, if you can please take our new friend to a sleepy room?&quot; the captain waited until a yellow seapony in a giant robot suit led the little pony out of the meeting hall before turning to Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Already verified,&quot; Twilight interrupted. Her last scrying spell revealed creatures which she had heard about, but fortunately, not encountered before personally. She still couldn&#039;t help but be upset at the fates of the colonists, &quot;It&#039;s like she said. The place is full of horrible monsters. I don&#039;t think there is any way to befriend them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Without Fluttershy,&#039; Twilight added in her own mind.</p><p class="double">Sealight nodded and spoke into her intercom, &quot;You all heard the little filly. Nothing down on the planet but horrible non-befriend-y monsters. The poor things must be tired of always crawling around in the dark and gloom. Let&#039;s give them all a little sunshine to play with!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle and Applejack sat transfixed as a monitor showed a missile streaking down towards the surface colony before exploding in a titanic blast.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah! That&#039;s it! Game over, for you!&quot; gleefully exclaimed another seapony marine. The name tag read &#039;Suds on&#039;.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, campers, a new game has just begun,&quot; Sealight said, &quot;It appears this ship is full of happy sunshine missiles. And if we don&#039;t use them all this year, Queen Marina won&#039;t let us have new shiny ones to play next year. So we&#039;re going to turn this planet into a smooth glowy marble. Smooth marble planets are the best!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a large amount of cheering from the seapony contingent.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I recon that since the planet don&#039;t have no ecosystem any longer, that my job here is done,&quot; Applejack stood up on shaky legs, &quot;If you all need me, I&#039;ll be hiding in my bunk.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just sat and watched transfixed as the missiles rained down.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Hello again, happy campers. Captain Sealight here once again,&quot; Twilight looked up from her book when she heard the voice over the intercom. She had been in her bunk for the last day, feeling the ship rumble every time a missile was launched. This was followed by the cheers of the seaponies - as if they were watching a giant fireworks show. Applejack hadn&#039;t left her locked cabin in all of this time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Our resident tactical science pony, Sea Star, has expressed some concerns that some of the space monsters may be hiding deep inside the planet and had not seen any of our shiny gifts. To remedy this, we have sent them a few planet crackers, delightfully wrapped and complete with a greeting card. If you look out your windows, you can all see how a new asteroid belt is made. This is captain Sealight, wishing every pony a super fun day! Shoo bee doo!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shoo, shoo bee doo!&quot; came the chorus of answering voices of the seapony marines.</p><p class="double">Twilight debated whether or not to observe the spectacle. Since her friend&#039;s cabin was right next to hers, Twilight asked Applejack if she would watch, but all she heard back through the wall was a muffled, &quot;Eenope. Nope nope nope nope nope.&quot;</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;Shoo bee doo, all you happy campers,&quot; came the captain&#039;s voice from the intercom, &quot;As you all know, we have spent the last week in this system by playing the super fun &#039;let&#039;s drag the largest parts of the former planet and toss them into the sun&#039; game. But as all good times tend to do; this one has to come to an end for now. So with that, I&#039;d like to announce that we will finally be leaving this place and heading back home.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought she heard a faint &quot;Finally!&quot; from Applejack&#039;s cabin.</p><p class="double">&quot;So without further ado, &#039;The Sealaco&#039; will be exiting the system going into hyperspace,&quot; Sealight&#039;s voice said, adding, &quot;Right as soon as we blow up the sun. It&#039;s the only way to be sure. This is Captain Sealight saying &#039;shoo bee doo&#039;, every pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, are you all right?&quot; Twilight worriedly asked at the wall dividing their cabins. But all she heard was faint muffled whimpering.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.9 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">An alicorn, a showmare, a changeling, and a guard captain all went bowling together.</p><p class="double">There had been a bit of a kerfluffle, of course, when Cadance had announced the idea. But she had gone on to explain that right now the relationship between her and Chrysalis basically boiled down to &quot;I got him and you didn&#039;t&quot; which wasn&#039;t healthy for either side, and that was on top of the whole.... thing, between Shining and Chrysalis.</p><p class="double">&quot;But why bowling?&quot; Trixie asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I like bowling,&quot; Cadance replied. &quot;Not everything I like is about love and weddings.&quot;</p><p class="double">So here they were, all in bowling shoes and ponytailed manes, studiously oblivious to the freaking out of the citizens around them.</p><p class="double">&quot;STRIKE!&quot; Cadance shouted with a huge smirk. &quot;Three in a row!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rolled her eyes. &quot;Don&#039;t count your eggs before they hatch. You just have an early winning streak, that&#039;s all.&quot; She took her own ball and slipped it down the lane, grinning as the pins went down. &quot;See? Not hard at all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, this might actually be a challenge!&quot; Cadance giggeld. &quot;Shining, it&#039;s your turn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, yeah....&quot; The stallion stood up, grabbing a ball and lazily slinging it it down the lane. &quot;...A seven split. Okay, sure.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie rolled her eyes. &quot;You&#039;re not very good at this, are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really, no....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.10 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke as she normally did at the beginning of a loop in her room in Canterlot, but something was off. She took a look around as she waited for her loop memories to kick in. The most obvious was the honkin huge brass telescope she was perched beneath. Subtler details, like the Jakehoof&#039;s Ladder and Van Der Giraffe generator told her she was living, not in a library, but in a mad scientist&#039;s labratory.</p><p class="double">In fact, it kinda reminded her of that one loop where everypony suddenly got interested in Contraptionlogy, only this time she wasn&#039;t a disembodied brain up against the Great and Powerful Robo-trixie.</p><p class="double">Her loop memories confirmed it. One of her fondest memories had been when she had won a mentorship from Director Celestia herself with her egg laying machine. Granted, the fact that the machine had gone rogue and tried to eat the judges and her parents had been a bit of a dark spot, but it had turned out happily in the end.</p><p class="double">In fact, one of the subjects of that memory was walking through the door right now, carrying a tray with a teapot and cups on it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, old bean, you&#039;re awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, I&#039;m awake Spike, I&#039;m always awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That not what I saw earlier, when I saw you hunched over the astonoscope.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;So, Spike&#039;s not Awake this loop&#039; She paused and continued speaking.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike, can you take a letter for Director Celestia?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right-o!&quot; He moved to the single writing desk in the room and removed a piece of paper and grabbed a quill in claw, waiting for her to speak.</p><p class="double">&#039;Thats certainly an odd anachronism. Quill and ink, but mad science everywhere else.&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Director Celestia,</p><p class="double">As you know, I&#039;ve been observing the moon&#039;s surface these past few weeks and the increased activity there leads to be to believe that your sister plans to make a rather violent return after her 10 yr banishment. I humbly suggest mobilizing every able-bodied mare and stallion to meet her and whatever forces she&#039;s mustered.&quot;</p><p class="double">You&#039;re faithful pupil,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike rolled up the letter, placing it in a glass and metal tube and inserting that tube into a pipe, one of many that ran along the wall, where it was sucked away with a whoosh. A few minutes later, another tube returned through another pipe, somersaulting and landing in Spike&#039;s waiting claws. He opened the tube and unfurled the letter inside and began reading.</p><p class="double">&quot;My Faithful Pupil, Twilight,</p><p class="double">I&#039;m well aware of my sister&#039;s return, and have put in motion plans to counter her. However, for the moment, I&#039;d like you to go to Ponyville and look over the preparations for the Summer Sun Conference. And for heavens sake, please try to make some allies there.</p><p class="double">Your mentor,</p><p class="double">Director Celestia&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I suppose that went as well as could be expected.&quot;</p><p class="double"></p><p><hr></p><p class="double">41.11</p><p class="double">“O-kay, here we go.” Scootaloo kricked her neck one way, then the other. She itched to shake her wings out, getting them ready for what she knew was coming, but the dress didn&#039;t permit it.</p><p class="double">“Whoa, Scoots, we&#039;re just bridesmaids...” Applebloom said. “And ah don&#039;t appreciate you getting&#039; us all into this! We could be-”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo cut her off. “What if we get a cutie mark from it? This is a thing to try I don&#039;t think we&#039;d get another chance at!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah!” Sweetie said, nodding. “It&#039;s not very often that ponies we know get married.”</p><p class="double">“Right!” Scootaloo grinned. “So we&#039;ll be the best bridesmaids ever, so we get cutie marks for it!”</p><p class="double">“CUTIE-”</p><p class="double">“Sssh!” Rarity said, holding a hoof over her mouth. “We don&#039;t want to drown out the music, do we?”</p><p class="double">“Sorry...” the trio muttered. Then Scoots cocked her head. “Hey, I can hear it!”</p><p class="double">Sweetie nodded, her ears pricked to the faint strains of classical music.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo hid a smile, knowing that Sweetie most often got her mark for music or music related things.</p><p class="double">But it would be cheating to tell her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...speak now or forever hold your peace.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo perked up. This was about when things usually got interesting.</p><p class="double"><i>Mind Fog.</i></p><p class="double">“Thanks,” she whispered to Pansy. The spell in question would keep her emotions masked, because from now on they might start to get suspicious.</p><p class="double"><i>You are welcome,</i> the ersatz Device replied quietly.</p><p class="double">About then, a large door at the other end of the courtyard exploded.</p><p class="double">As flaming cinders and balks of gate timber crashed to the ground, the smoke eddied to reveal a unicorn wearing a cape.</p><p class="double">“I object!” Trixie shouted.</p><p class="double">“On what grounds?”</p><p class="double">“On what grounds?” Trixie stepped forward, slowly and deliberately. “On what grounds?”</p><p class="double">She gestured dramatically. “On the grounds of Canterlot Castle!”</p><p class="double">“Technically,” Twilight&#039;s voice came from behind Trixie, “we&#039;re not actually on the grounds. This is surrounded by buildings which aren&#039;t the curtain wall and which are connected to the castle itself – so we&#039;re in the castle.”</p><p class="double">“Despite the fact we can see the sky overhead?” Trixie asked, turning to face Twilight as she emerged from the smoke.</p><p class="double">“Yep.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that doesn&#039;t make much sense...”</p><p class="double">“Was there a point to this?” Celestia asked, frowning down at the two unicorns.</p><p class="double">“Indeed!” Trixie said loudly. “No fewer than seven! Firstly, and most importantly of all, this so-called fake knockoff Princess Cadence is Chartreuse. Everypony knows that the real one is a slightly duskier shade.”</p><p class="double">“Do we?” several ponies in the audience muttered.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t see it myself,” one donkey said, looking at the bride. “But then, how&#039;d I know? I haven&#039;t seen her before.”</p><p class="double">“I certainly don&#039;t know what you mean...” Shining said, glancing across the aisle then shrugging.</p><p class="double">“Well, of course you wouldn&#039;t, you&#039;ve been brainwashed, keep up!” Trixie slammed a hoof on the floor. “Second, which is an auspicious number, there is the matter of the hairstyle.”</p><p class="double">As Trixie began a long lecture on hair stylage as it related to alicorns, occasionally interrupted by Twilight correcting her on a minor point, Scootaloo just began shaking her head.</p><p class="double">“What in tarnation is goin&#039; on?” Applebloom whispered. “How long do we have to hold this dress up?”</p><p class="double">“Dunno,” Scootaloo admitted.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear,” Rarity said quietly from her bench near the front. The three fillies all listened intently. “I do hope Twilight gives up this silly notion of hers before the whole hour is up...”</p><p class="double">“We might have to hold it for an hour?” Sweetie said, eyes wide. “This is the worst thing ever!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And thus, do I conclude that the nature of the magic of the alicorn known as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is of the hue normally defined as &#039;pink&#039;, whereas the magic which has been witnessed upon this very day by my able compatriot Twilight Sparkle is a colour more normally known as &#039;green&#039;.”</p><p class="double">“Are you done yet?” Celestia asked, her eyes half closed. Most of the guests were snoring.</p><p class="double">“Almost!” Trixie set off a spell which produced a loud bang, jerking the guests back to wakefulness. “Seventh and last, we found the real one in a mine.”</p><p class="double">The smoke cleared.</p><p class="double">Several dozen ponies started kicking themselves that they hadn&#039;t noticed how unusual it was for a dramatic smoke cloud to linger for a full hour.</p><p class="double">And, through the wreckage that had once been a gate, stepped the real Princess Cadence.</p><p class="double">Celestia stared. “You couldn&#039;t have mentioned that first?”</p><p class="double">“I was having fun,” Trixie admitted. “Anyway. So. Imposter?”</p><p class="double">Hundreds of changelings dropped shapeshifts.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go,” Scootaloo said to herself as the wedding dissolved into chaos.</p><p class="double"><i>Set up. Fog cloud.</i></p><p class="double">An instant fogbank bloomed around the three Crusaders.</p><p class="double">“Stay with me, girls!” Scootaloo called, reaching out to the fog and gripping it with her weather magic. Then shaping it, so it compressed into solid objects.</p><p class="double">Normally this would take one hay of a lot of mental effort. When she was Bronze Wing, the occasional Jewel Scouts loops, the most she could manage even with the fuku-armour was a weapon and a hoplon-style shield.</p><p class="double">Of course, back then she hadn&#039;t had Pansy either.</p><p class="double"><i>Set up complete. Preparing to lock cloud forms.</i></p><p class="double">Cloud compressed into a suit of close-fitting armour, then flashed yellow.</p><p class="double"><i>Locked.</i></p><p class="double">A pair of shield, formed like bucklers and looking like they were made of bronze.</p><p class="double"><i>Locked.</i></p><p class="double">And, finally, a two-length staff.</p><p class="double"><i>Locked and ready.</i></p><p class="double">Rearing up on her hind legs, Scootaloo spun the staff around twice. Once at a low level, tripping two changeling mooks trying to close in on them. Then again, slightly higher, clouting them both on the head and knocking them senseless.</p><p class="double">“Whoa!” Sweetie Belle and Applebloom chorused.</p><p class="double">“Since when could you do that?” Applebloom added. “That&#039;s awesome!”</p><p class="double">Crouching down, Scootaloo slipped her staff under a changeling&#039;s body barrel and lifted... it? Him? Bodily into a stun spell from the dense pattern weaving out from Twilight.</p><p class="double">“A griffin showed me once – when you two were with your sisters, some time ago.” Scootaloo shrugged. “She was neat.”</p><p class="double">“What, the cloud shaping thing?”</p><p class="double">“Mostly.” Scootaloo intercepted a spell bolt headed for Applebloom, backing towards a corner with them behind her. “Hey, &#039;bloom? Punch any that get past me, okay?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.”</p><p class="double">Her staff glowed green, as a changeling got the idea to take her weapon away from her.</p><p class="double">It disappeared in a puff of cloud as Pansy released the magic maintaining it.</p><p class="double">More fog oozed from the Device, which Scootaloo quickly crafted into a shorter stick. With this, she clonked the enterprising changeling on the forehead.</p><p class="double">“Sooo cooool...” Sweetie Belle said with glee.</p><p class="double">In the distance, they heard Trixie&#039;s voice shouting something about “stun danmaku”.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">41.12 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">X-Communication</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">One explanation later, James was sitting there, rubbing his chin. &quot;I see, you do have a problem. But why did you come to me? Not that I&#039;m complaining. I like a challenge.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I read your article on the Meta law board of the Space law forum, &#039;The rights of an alien.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">The lawyer gave a lopsided frown. &quot;But my conclusion was that a non-human, even a sentient being capable of everything a human is, did not have any rights under any legal code, because every code assumes that &#039;sentient being&#039; and &#039;human&#039; are identical terms. Basically, they are considered a wild animal, no matter what degree of intelligence they show. Weren&#039;t you offended?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The fact offends me, but it&#039;s a natural consequence of you being the only intelligent race on your planet...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sometimes I wonder about that.&quot; James shook his head ruefully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Taking offence at you because you explained it in a clear and well thought out manner, that&#039;s just silly. It got me to researching your background. First from Cambridge, several years at Conham and Perks, one of the biggest and most prestigious law firms in your country, amateur science fiction writer and frequent poster on boards dealing with space law and metalaw... I just have one question, why leave to start up your own business?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Call me an idealist, or crazy,&quot; he grinned. &quot;I needed time with an existing law firm to tick the boxes for my own professional development, but most of what I was doing was corporate legal work. I became a lawyer to help people get fair treatment under the law, not to help them figure out ways to evade it.</p><p class="double">&quot;There was this one case where an oil company was going to buy some second hand tankers that weren&#039;t fully up to modern operating standards, rather than springing for new safer ones. Ultimately it would cost them more in maintenance and operating costs, not to mention the costs of the inevitable accidents, but those wouldn&#039;t show on that year&#039;s operating statement, and affect the directors bonuses. Our job was to figure out how to limit their liabilities, basically ensure that when something did go wrong, they&#039;d suffer as little as possible.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that it was all like that, or even mostly, but there were a couple of times I really didn&#039;t enjoy what I was doing. So I put in my time, made contacts, did the best job I could, and left as soon as I could scrape together the money.&quot; He made a gesture around the room. &quot;I don&#039;t make anything like as much money, but I sleep better at nights, and I get to help real people, rather than faceless corporations.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The problem is, while I&#039;m real enough, I&#039;m not a person.&quot; Twilight pulled a high end tablet/laptop from her saddlebag and placed it on the desk.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not going to be easy to change that, especially not in the current social climate... Where did you get that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I bought it, or at least paid money for it. I should have said, I had some gold coins with me in a sub-space pocket when I was shifted here. I teleported into a bank vault at night and exchanged some for legal currency, then I went and did the same at various shops, listing and paying for what I took. It&#039;s not like I could walk up to the counter during normal working hours, I&#039;d cause a riot. I mean, if I didn&#039;t have local money, how would I be able to pay for your services?&quot; Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;That is still technically breaking and entering, even if you didn&#039;t break anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not a person, remember? I can do wrong, but I can&#039;t commit crimes. Just crossing national borders without the right visas or a passport is illegal. But no-pony asks a migrating bird for their papers. And I&#039;m not on the list of animals that need a six month quarantine to enter the UK, so I&#039;m good there too. Not that I intend to use the loophole to do anything immoral or hurt anyone, it&#039;s just in my position, I have to take advantage of whatever I can to accomplish my goals.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And those goals are?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;First, build a way to get home. To be honest, I could just squirrel myself away somewhere in the wilderness or on a near Earth asteroid and set up an alchemical forge to produce the needed materials without ever interacting with humans again. But my second goal is to help out. Partly it&#039;s because you guys need it, even without the recent alien invasion. Not that I&#039;m saying what you&#039;ve accomplished on your own isn&#039;t amazing, but there are ways I can help without detracting from that. Also, I want to prove to those X-Com guys and everyone that Equestrians are not like those invaders you&#039;ve been dealing with. Aliens aren&#039;t automatically evil.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;However, without a legal identity you have one foot... hoof in a bucket.&quot; James mused as the tablet powered up. &quot;I assume this has your - oh, yes the obvious solution. That&#039;s kind of embarrassing, after I railed at big corporations.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, from what I&#039;ve read, a corporate entity can be set up to any end, and is a legal individual. I was thinking two actually, a private limited company to manage business investments, and a non-profit charity to funnel the profits into worthy causes. Have I got this right?&quot;</p><p class="double">The lawyer looked it over. &quot;Hmm... in rough, there are things I&#039;d have done differently, and things you&#039;ve missed out, but overall a good effort. You have legal training yourself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As Princess Celestia&#039;s protégé I studied the basics of Equestrian law, and I did some study in university libraries and on the internet over the last couple on nights, but that doesn&#039;t make me a lawyer especially in human law. However, I should be able to follow what a specialist says.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gestured to James with a hoof. Of course, she didn&#039;t tell him that she was a fully trained lawyer in multiple jurisdictions, because those had all happened in other loops and therefore didn&#039;t count. She&#039;d deliberately held her input to what could be expected from a relative novice, including a couple of minor mistakes. </p><p class="double">There may have been things she&#039;d actually missed, too... common law precedent could get annoying.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and the lawyer discussed what she intended to do with the organisations she was going to set up, which they decide to call Nightlight Industries and the Nightlight Foundation. The tagline was &#039;Better to light a candle&#039;, and the logo Twilight had designed using the laptop&#039;s graphics tool was a stylised conical candle, which if you squinted looked a lot like a unicorn horn.</p><p class="double">At the end James chuckled. &quot;So Nightlight Ltd will be going into the salvage business. Oh, this is going to be interesting! I&#039;ll need around £50,000 to get things rolling. Thankfully, the registration fees for setting things up aren&#039;t too bad. Fortunately you don&#039;t need one of the expensive slots. I can get some more of your gold, or some smaller gems exchanged to cover it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How long will it take you to organise?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;A couple of days. I do have other work to complete, and i can&#039;t abandon my other clients no matter how much fun this project will be. However, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, almost everything can be done via internet forms. I can hand off the details to my assistants. Of course that will mean I&#039;ll have to tell them everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;That&#039;s fine. It&#039;s not like they&#039;re not already eavesdropping at the door...&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a thump and a crash, followed by a pained &#039;ouch&#039;.</p><p class="double">James&#039; good mood evaporated instantly. &quot;No! I am so sorry! They know better than break client confidentiality, and I intend to remind them of it. How did you... oh, some sort of spell?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually I didn&#039;t until the noises. But it was a logical deduction.&quot; Twilight giggled, then sobered. &quot;Please, don&#039;t be hard on them. They were probably only listening because they were worried about you being in the same room as a monster from outer space. They were most likely ready to rush in here to rescue you at the first sound of trouble. Not that I can think of anything useful they could have done, but that just makes it more impressive. It&#039;s clear they consider you a friend, as well as a boss.&quot;</p><p class="double">James looked slightly embarrassed at the compliment. &quot;Yes, well... Let&#039;s go and discuss your plan with my overly protective employees, and get things moving.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>X-Com had calmed down in the last couple of days after mission Bring Night, but it was a tense sort of calm. There had been no further alien attacks, and nothing more from their current bête noire, Sparkle. Despite their best efforts, they still hadn&#039;t eradicated the video of Sparkle from the internet, or the many derivations with everything from Guile&#039;s Theme to Gurren Laggan incorporating the footage. Even the debunking of it as a CGI publicity stunt hadn&#039;t stopped it, and Commander Benford had censured further action against the spa or the originator, Kimiko Mizuno, as the damage was done, and doing so would simply attract more attention to her and neutering what little effect the countermeasure had.</p><p class="double">Currently he was in Command Central, looking up at the holo-globe, and wondering where in the world Sparkle was, and what she was planning.</p><p class="double">&quot;Commander, we&#039;ve got a problem!&quot;</p><p class="double">One of the monitoring techs looked up and he immediately activated his headset. &quot;What do we have?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not alien activity, at least not normal alien activity. NASA Orbital Debris Tracking reported it, and it&#039;s confirmed. Every tracked piece of debris within 1400 miles of Earth is moving, accelerating!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What about our satellites? The ISS? Are there any impacts?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not affected, we&#039;ve asked for reports from various other government and commercial tracking stations, so far not a single active satellite has been affected by this force, or hit by the affected objects. Only the debris, though we&#039;re getting reports that natural astrolites are affected too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is there a pattern?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re working on it!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was a tense half hour as the operations staff collated the data from the X-Com satellite net and dozens of other government and commercial satellite tracking stations, most of whom didn&#039;t even realise they were contributing to the effort. However, a pattern was emerging. Everything which wasn&#039;t an active satellite had been yanked out of it&#039;s orbit and hauled away.</p><p class="double">The holo-globe now displayed the new configuration of the junk, and clearly showed a pattern forming. Doctor Vahlen was summarizing the results her teams had been analysing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Everything below the 1000 kilometre height accelerated upwards, and at peak velocity was making around 50 kilometres per second, exceeding solar escape velocity. Similarly the objects above were driven down at similar velocities. Only debris was targeted, and there were three detected cases where a piece of debris was likely to intercept an active satellite, only to swerve at the last minute to pass by in the lee of their orbital track.</p><p class="double">&quot;That alone would indicate some intelligent agency controlling events, one which is able to detect and control every object within two thousand kilometres of Earth&#039;s surface in real time. What happened next is even more disturbing. On approaching the 1000 kilometre boundary, all these objects did a right angle turn to head towards a single point in Equatorial orbit. What is more,they started to slow down as they approached the coalescence point, and appear to have accreted into a body estimated to be around eighty metres in diameter and weighing around 5000 tons, based on the estimated amount of debris in those orbits.&quot;</p><p class="double">She shook her head. &quot;Objects in space don&#039;t swerve, and they most certainly do not make right angle turns! I would suspect this to be some telekinetic trick of Sparkle&#039;s, except that I can not conceive of any being that could keep track of so many objects, let alone accelerate thousands of tons at accelerations an air to air missile would be hard pressed to match. The very concept is terrifying.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen found himself in agreement with Vahlen, a rare occurrence. &quot;It took the processing power of our entire computer system and dozens of stations all over the world to just track the objects, and even then we had to rotate between groups to handle the data. A dedicated system could be built to handle the data, but it would need to be several times the power of our present system. </p><p class="double">&quot;However, whoever did it also did us a massive favour. At a best guess, over 90 percent of all the orbital debris around Earth and almost everything in low earth orbit has been swept away. The dangers of a collision have been reduced to almost nothing. As to moving the debris, Elerium could provide the power, but projecting and controlling it as some sort of tractor beam - the aliens use gravity control, but our own research hasn&#039;t even started to explore that sort of application. I find it fascinating.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well someone has.&quot; Commander Benford stated, looking up at the dot which now circled the translucent globe. &quot;We should be able to get a closer look, the US Department of Defense has sacrificed the station keeping fuel in one of their Keyhole observation satellites to put it into an orbit with an apogee that should take it above the object by a dozen miles at it&#039;s closest approach. We should be getting a feed soon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Vahlen poke up. &quot;With your permission Commander, I shall set up close monitoring of the satellite as it approaches the object. The deviation in its orbit may give us a better read of the mass. We have the details?&quot;</p><p class="double">As she set up her tracking watch, a video window opened up in front of the globe, showing a black sky, and a green illuminated date stamp and time as well as figures around the edge that showed attitude and orbital characteristics, all changing as they watched. &quot;We have satellite feed sir! They&#039;re bringing it around to align the primary optic on the object.&quot;</p><p class="double">A large grey white dot appeared on the edge of the display, and drifted towards the centre. It was too distant to see any details, but it definitely showed as a shape. When it reached the centre of the aiming reticules, it came to a halt. It seemed to explode outwards, and a magnification number that sat in the top left of the screen spun up.</p><p class="double">It now filled the central portion of the screen, a rugged mass of detritus, with several upper rocket stages lined neatly along one face, and a number of physically intact satellites suspended around it like a halo. There was also a small blob of purple that was the only moving object on the surface. The camera zoomed in again to show it clearly, and Vahlen gave an actual growl of frustration.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, apparently unprotected from the rigours of space, was picking her way over the variegated surface, carrying a number of objects along with her in a purple grip. The smallest, in front of her was possibly some sort of tablet computer from the glow, while the objects flanking her were a slightly larger box that appeared to have come from inside one of the satellites. The third was more mysterious, a large crystal prism, as large as she was, with some sort of golden pattern on it&#039;s surface.</p><p class="double">She suddenly stopped, turning her attention from the computer screen and looked up. She stared directly at the camera then gave a cheery wave with a hoof before going back to her work. The box was set in place on a large plate and welded there by a brief arc from her horn. She returned her attention to the computer, and although she didn&#039;t apparently do anything, one of the techs called out, &quot;We&#039;re getting a signal!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What does it say?&quot; Commander Benford demanded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... it&#039;s a standard spacecraft transponder, probably from one of those satellites, or more than one. Those things are built to last much longer than their mission lifetimes, just add power and you&#039;re good to go. I&#039;m checking the registry now...&quot;</p><p class="double">They waited a long moment as the tech and others entered commands and brought up information. The lead tech shook his head. &quot;Huh, it checks out alright, International Space Authority transponder code is valid, registration current... Transponder is registered to a Nightlight Industries, and they also registered a 1000 klick orbit, inclination... off-set... all the paperwork matches up. The spacecraft purpose even states orbital salvage and reclamation. It all checks out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t believe it!&quot; Vahlen exclaimed glaring up at the screen as if it had done her a personal injury. &quot;No-body noticed a purple unicorn wander into their office and fill out forms? Not to mention where did she... it get the money to set it up, or the knowledge?&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen replied. &quot;In reverse order: you, at least where to find the information; she still has most of that bag of gold; and a lot of the forms are electronic. No-body even sees them. It isn&#039;t like it&#039;s a sought after orbit, too high for earth sensing, too low for geostationary or GPS use. Even if someone did see it, there have been a couple of companies formed to develop ways to collect space garbage, and one even registered orbital slots. This would have looked like more of the same.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m more interested in what that other object is.&quot; Benford redirected their attention to the screen where Twilight was implanting the crystal in the body of the mass. Her head dipped to touch it with her horn, and it lit up from within with a purple glow, while patterns of golden light blaze don the sides. However nothing else seemed to happen. &quot;Hmmm... maybe it failed?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir!&quot; The lead tech caught his attention. &quot;I think you&#039;ll want to see this. We had the area under observation from the ground with optical telescopes in case the satellite failed, and... well, maybe it&#039;s better to show you.&quot;</p><p class="double">A second projected screen opened in front of them, and the mass of debris was once again seen from a distance. However, clearly circling it was a ring of glowing purple text. &#039;Crazy Twilight&#039;s Space Salvage&#039;. An inner ring proclaimed &#039;Out of this world prices!&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;A billboard.&quot; Doctor Vahlen exclaimed disgustedly. &quot;A giant holographic billboard!&quot;</p><p class="double">Doctor Shen was punching away at a calculator. &quot;Given those dimensions and if the brightness is... oh dear. It will be visible to the naked eye, obvious as a 2nd magnitude star. People are going to be looking, and even a hobbyist&#039;s telescope should be able to read the sign.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What does it think it&#039;s doing!&quot; Doctor Vahlen fumed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Advertising.&quot; Commander Benford replied. &quot;And making sure there&#039;s no way we can keep its presence quiet, I suspect.&quot;</p><p class="double">The control room was silent, in part because the occupants were still trying to come to terms with recent events, but mostly because no-one wanted to ask Commander Benford if he&#039;d just made a joke. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

YEARLING JUST ANNOUNCED SHE&#039;S GOING TO HAVE THE NEXT DARING DO BOOK OUT!&quot; Dash interrupted. &quot;Can you believe it?! After all these loops, finally, finally, A REAL SEQUEL!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;M SO EXCITED!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;M EVEN MORE EXCITED!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;OHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike raised an eyescale warily. &quot;So... when is this new book coming out?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In four months and three days!&quot; Rainbow cheered. &quot;Hahahahahaha!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And... you two do realize that the loop ends friday?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pegasus and alicorn stopped dead. Magenta eyes slowly swivelled to meet lavender, wings furling as excitement drained away to sombre horror.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;....Clorophyl,&quot;</i> Twilight finally mumbled. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.2</p><p class="double">“Okay, Cookie,” Applebloom said, cracking her elbows. “I&#039;m out of other things to do. I&#039;m getting It out.”</p><p class="double"><i>What, precisely,</i> Cookie asked, <i>is It?</i></p><p class="double">“Oh, right, you weren&#039;t there for that. One of the really old loopers was clearing out his Pocket of loads of junk he didn&#039;t want – something about needing the storage space for another fleet – and there was this little golden egg thing going free, so I snapped it up. It looked interesting...” Applebloom mused.</p><p class="double">She sat back on the roof of the Appleloosa home she shared with her sister and brother – neither of them Awake. In fact, she and Twilight were the only Awake ponies on Equestria.</p><p class="double">It was a rather bizarre variant, from what Twilight had told her. Without Applejack to take up Honesty, Twilight had decided to try an experiment, and Gilda had ended up the Element of Brutal Honesty.</p><p class="double">She, Dash and Pinkie were engaged in a three way prank war which was claiming their combined dignities as the first casualties.</p><p class="double"><i>So, what is it?</i> Cookie pressed.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s just it.” Applebloom took a pair of tongs, and lifted the golden egg from her subspace pocket. “I&#039;ve got no idea, except that touching it is a really, really bad idea. That was made pretty clear by the guy when I got the thing. And, well, when else am I going to get four years in a desert to work out what the hay it does?”</p><p class="double"><i>Right.</i> The Intelligent Device/Founder emitted an electronic sigh. <i>When you put it like that, it almost seems responsible.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay. Examination of the marbled patterns on the surface reveals that they are the macroscopic expression of microscopic structures. This trend continues all the way down to the...” Applebloom spun the wheels on her microscope. “...huh. Well, looks like time to break out the electron microscope.”</p><p class="double"><i>You have one of those?</i></p><p class="double">“Not yet.” Taking out tools, Applebloom went over to the gargantuan junk pile she&#039;d got Twilight to dump near her carefully-protected cave.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I dunno...” Mac said, frowning. “You want t&#039; be homeschooled?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;d give me more time to do what I really want to do, Mac,” Applebloom said earnestly. “Besides, I can already do the exams – I just want it to be official. Come on! Ask me somethin&#039; difficult!”</p><p class="double">“Well, if y&#039; say so...” Mac looked off into the distance for a moment. “X squared plus four x equals five. What&#039;s x?”</p><p class="double">“One or minus five,” Applebloom replied promptly.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Differentiate e to th&#039; x.”</p><p class="double">“Answer&#039;s the same as the question – e to the x – unless you mean differentiating by a different variable, in which case zero. Come on, something a bit harder.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Mac thought for a while longer. “Well, if y&#039;all say that you really know your stuff... what&#039;s e raised to the power of the square root of negative one times a linear variable?”</p><p class="double">“A cosine curve in radians.”</p><p class="double">Mac looked at her. Then he nodded. “Eeyup, that&#039;s right. And y&#039; say that you know all th&#039; subjects?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded.</p><p class="double">“Well, ah&#039;ll keep an eye on th&#039; scores y&#039;all get on th&#039; exams, but fer now you got yourself a deal.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is amazing!” Applebloom said, furiously tapping away at the controls which were moving the electron probe over the surface of the egg. “It&#039;s <i>all</i> machinery. Solid machinery, on an atomic scale.”</p><p class="double">She paused over a number of pits in the surface of the egg, one after the other. “This is some kind of sensor – visual. And this uses scent. And this can only be a physical contact sensor! This thing can detect more with a square millimetre of surface than most animals can with their whole bodies!”</p><p class="double">Carefully, she lowered the microprobe over a different kind of pit, and used the tunneling mode to peel back a tiny section of surface.</p><p class="double">“This is just so cool!”</p><p class="double"><i>What&#039;s that you&#039;re looking at?</i> Cookie asked, paying attention to the screen herself. </p><p class="double">“It looks like a kind of... nanotech stinging cell.” Applebloom sobered a bit. “Okay, <i>definitely</i> not touching this thing. But I can probably use some of the tech that goes into this...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay.” Applebloom checked the range safety; good. Then the eraser warhead, which was ready to go.</p><p class="double">Nanotech was scary stuff. But, with a few... perhaps slightly Trixie-flavoured precautions, a lot of the threat could be accounted for.</p><p class="double">Which was why Applebloom was telefactoring a drone from ten miles away.</p><p class="double">“Initiating mycelium.”</p><p class="double">The drone (which, for reasons of Applebloom&#039;s own, looked an awful lot like a motorized pine tree) dripped the contents of a small vial onto the surface of a chunk of volcanic rock.</p><p class="double">There was a froth of bubbles, which quickly died away, and then a mass of hair-fine filaments spread over the surface of the rock.</p><p class="double">Five minutes later, the rock crumpled in on itself. What was left was a set of twenty nodules of varying sizes, each a pure metal ore.</p><p class="double">Applebloom checked a couple of readouts, then exhaled. “Right. And it cleaned up after itself, too – good.”</p><p class="double">Given the tech in question, that hadn&#039;t been a certainty...</p><p class="double"><i>What now?</i></p><p class="double">“Well, ah think there&#039;s about three more months o&#039; work before that node is completely dismantled,” Applebloom guessed. “Good thing ah&#039;ve been takin&#039; it slow, too, &#039;cause of all the traps an&#039; all.”</p><p class="double"><i>True,</i> Cookie allowed.</p><p class="double">There&#039;d been at least one close call with a nasty computer virus – one seemingly implicit in the very design of a sub-component of the object, and almost sapient in the sheer sophistication that went into it.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, Applebloom had managed to catch it in time, and Cookie had fought it off within the computer system itself.</p><p class="double">“This thing&#039;s almost an entire nanotech ecology, is what it is...” Applebloom mused, then shrugged. “Well, ah guess we&#039;re harvestin&#039; the crops and tryin&#039; to kill the pests.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And...” Applebloom saved the final file on her handheld. “Done!”</p><p class="double">She grinned with the euphoria of finally having finished her self-appointed task, which banished the slightly muzzy feeling of two consecutive coffee-fuelled all nighters. The egg – which was, according to internal code snippets, something called a Jain node – had been completely dismantled, all the inbuilt traps avoided by a slow and steady approach involving a great deal of caution.</p><p class="double">Sure, about ninety percent of what she&#039;d learned was far too dangerous to use, but the remaining ten percent would let her finally crack the inherent problems involved with most nanotechnology.</p><p class="double">Well... if she had Cookie to run it, anyway. A dismayingly large portion of the software needed to run this Jain technology was written in a form that was as virulent as the rest of it.</p><p class="double"><i>Um...</i> Cookie cut in on her thoughts.</p><p class="double">“What?” Before she forgot, Applebloom slipped the handheld into her subspace pocket. She wasn&#039;t about to lose fully five years of effort when the Tree of Doom rolled around next week.</p><p class="double"><i>You appear to have... wings. And a horn.</i></p><p class="double">The filly went stock still.</p><p class="double">“Can you repeat that, please?”</p><p class="double"><i>You seem to have Ascended.</i></p><p class="double">“Oh.” Applebloom tried to get her head around that. “Huh, ah always thought we&#039;d do it together. Scoots, Belle and me.”</p><p class="double">Cookie didn&#039;t say anything.</p><p class="double">“Right. In about ten seconds, ah&#039;m gonna actually realize what just happened. So if you&#039;ll excuse me, ah&#039;ll freakout for a bit.”</p><p class="double"><i>Sure.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom took one more breath, then started running around in circles.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Just...” Applebloom shook her head, watching the sun go down over a mesa in the far distance. “Ah&#039;m still overwhelmed by this.”</p><p class="double"><i>I understand</i>, Cookie said. <i>I suppose it must be very confusing. I mean, I felt strange enough becoming a pendant, but I was at least ready for it.</i></p><p class="double">“Yeah, ah know what y&#039; mean,” Applebloom agreed. “Still, ah don&#039;t think th&#039; loops have ever blindsided me like <i>this</i>.”</p><p class="double"><i>Technically, this was all you. Not the Loops at all.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom directed a glower at Cookie&#039;s pendant.</p><p class="double"><i>Sorry, that was flippant,</i> Cookie said, with a tone of contrition.</p><p class="double">“I... no, ah understand,” Applebloom admitted. “Just... don&#039;t tell th&#039; other Crusaders, okay? Or your friends. Ah...”</p><p class="double">She kicked the ground.</p><p class="double">“Ah feel <i>embarassed</i>, is what it is, &#039;cause ah feel like ah&#039;ve left them behind. Like... well, we always wanted t&#039; find cutie marks, and... by the time we started loopin&#039;, we were told by Twilight that we&#039;d all got several different ones in different loops we weren&#039;t Awake for. But...” The filly scuffed at the dirt again, before slumping to the floor and rolling on her back, heedless of her new wings, to watch the stars come out. “Ah never gave a moment&#039;s thought to how we&#039;d all feel if just <i>one</i> of us got a cutie mark. Back before we got t&#039; Looping.”</p><p class="double"><i>I think I see. You feel like you&#039;ve lost one of the things which you shared with your friends.</i></p><p class="double">“Yeah.”</p><p class="double">For several minutes, neither of them made a sound.</p><p class="double"><i>You will have to tell Twilight eventually,</i> Cookie pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Probably, yeah,” Applebloom said quietly. “It&#039;d be best to get it done this loop, when there ain&#039;t any other loopers and she can help me get all this worked out. But... ah don&#039;t want to. At all.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow, I&#039;ve got some bad news.&quot; Twilight sighed, holding out a newsletter. &quot;Yearling&#039;s pushed back the release by two months.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;TWO MONTHS?&quot; The pegasus snatched the newsletter and opened it quickly. &quot;That&#039;s... that&#039;s eight more loops I have to wait!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eight more expansion periods,&quot; Twilight corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uuuuurgh, I wish she was looping so she could finish sooner.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s got a life of her own, Dash. We can&#039;t really force her to do anything.&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;All we can do is wait.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... I guess you&#039;re right.&quot; With a sigh, Rainbow Dash tossed the newsletter into the garbage. &quot;It&#039;s not like anything important will happen because of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember the old days where we&#039;d go on crazy adventures just because, I dunno, you wanted a book from the hospital or I was late for a friendship letter?&quot; The alicorn giggled and rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. We really got caught up by unimportant things. Well, loop&#039;s ending tomorrow.... wanna help me with a really stupid stunt?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Alright, but if I die then next loop you have to dress in style and give fashion tips.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I guess that&#039;s fair.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.3 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie <i>loved</i> this Loop. It had, in her opinion, everything. Epic battles for the fate of the universe; ninja; robots; aliens; mutant races nature probably never intended; an amazing back story of love, loss, and betrayal; the coolest non-deity identity she&#039;d looped into yet; and the bestest new friends ever!</p><p class="double">&quot;So he was an ancient ninja master who turned traitor over some woman his rival loved and left the country to start a megacorp to take over the world, but really all along he was some squishy brain alien criminal in a robot suit who had designs on taking over the whole galaxy once he manufactured an army of ninja robots and super mutants her of Earth and the only force that could stop him was a secret band of mutant ninjas, you all, living in the sewers! Oh, and the lovely science assistant and intrepid reporter, me, of course. And we beat him!&quot; Pinkie was practically vibrating with excitement. &quot;You know what this calls for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A pizza party!&quot; her companion in the orange mask yelled with equal enthusiasm.</p><p class="double">&quot;Two of them,&quot; the one in the red mask griped for the umpteenth time this Loop. &quot;Why in the wide, wide multiverse did there have to be two of them?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Statistics,&quot; the one with the purple mask replied with good humor. &quot;We were bound to run into someone like her in these Loops sooner or later.&quot;</p><p class="double">The leader in the blue mask just gave a long-suffering sigh. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Rainbow Dash landed in the middle of a desert, eyeing the strange fortress warily.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay.... how the hay did we not notice this before?&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn shrugged, reapplying the cooling charms on both of them. &quot;A week ago this was a heavily forested region. Granted, I&#039;ve been here a few times before, but....&quot; She chuckled awkwardly. &quot;Well, usually I was just out camping or doing one of my crazier schemes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Crazier.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did I ever tell you about the time I convinced Celestia and Luna that Equestria ran on Newtonian physics? I had to set up a secret lab to automate the weather and wrest control of the sun and moon from them... the looks on their faces, I&#039;m telling you, hilarious.&quot; She gestured around the blackened sands. &quot;Anyway, this is where I had my secret animal training facility. To... dedomesticate them... actually, yeah, this fortress was here then too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow sighed, ascending for a moment. &quot;Twilight, this fortress is practically throbbing with weather magic. The mystery of the heat wave? Right here. Frankly we&#039;re lucky to have found it before it melted itself down.&quot; She tapped the stone briefly before snapping back with a yelp. &quot;OH SWEET MAPLE LEAVES! Ow, ow ow.... huh, it doesn&#039;t hurt anymore...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Here, let me see that.&quot; The purple pony brought her face close to the blackened hoof, wincing in sympathy. &quot;Ow. Wow, okay, that&#039;s a <i>fourth</i> degree burn. I&#039;m going to have to use a localized time spell to reverse this, there&#039;s no way it&#039;ll just heal....&quot;</p><p class="double">The blue pony held her hoof out patiently while her friend tended to her. &quot;Fourth degree? It&#039;s difficult to burn a pegasus, what with our magic and all, and you&#039;re telling me that this fortress somehow managed to charcoalize an alicorn&#039;s hoof?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmyep.&quot; Twilight took a breath, shaking her head. &quot;Okay, before we go any further I&#039;m going to need to put more defensive wards on us.&quot; Her horn glowed even brighter, spells weaving through the air for a full minute and enveloping the pair in brightly shining runes. When she finally finished, she took out two pairs of goggles and handed one to Dash.</p><p class="double">The former pegasus put them on without question. &quot;I take it that this is serious?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m operating under the assumption that somebody tried to make a star in here. So yeah, super serious.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even with the shields on, the two could feel the blast of heat on their faces as they entered the fortress. Twilight cast a few spells and sagged in relief. &quot;Ha, I was wrong. No stars, just... apparently a reverse heat ray aimed at the sun. It&#039;s overloaded, but at least the safeties held.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash stared at her. &quot;What, exactly, would happen if the safeties didn&#039;t hold?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All the heat would have been released at once and the atmosphere would be set on fire.&quot; Twilight trotted up to a pillar of melted bronze and gold, kicking away an odd skeleton and flicking a spell or two around the metal. &quot;If I can just aim an exhaust spell at the sun, I might be able to send all the conserved heat back. I think this was meant to be a storm generator, you know, warm up the local air currents to cause a rainstorm or something.... who the heck pointed it directly at the sun?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahuizotl.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn rolled her eyes. &quot;Rainbow, I&#039;m pretty sure that the Daring Do series is labelled fiction this loop-&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash pointed at the big skeleton that Twilight had kicked away. &quot;No, that&#039;s Ahuizotl. I know from one of my Daring Do loops. That is, one hundred percent, the real deal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Twilight peered at the corpse. &quot;Well... okay, that&#039;s weird. I was sure we were in a baseline loop, and the Daring Do is labelled as fictional...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think she&#039;s around?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If she is...&quot; With a sigh, the Anchor turned to face her friend. &quot;She&#039;s dead. At least for this loop... should be ending soon anyway. This doesn&#039;t make sense! I&#039;m going to have to stake this area out next loop....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack broke out laughing, barely able to hold onto the mug that her brother had prepared for her. &quot;So Maccy ended up being yer sister fer the loop, eh? Ah gotta admit that cracks me up ta think about.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes, sipping her punch with a smirk. &quot;Biggest princess you ever saw, hooves as thick as his neck.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmer leaned over the table. &quot;So what did ya have ta banish Mac fer when it came time?&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian grinned slyly. &quot;I didn&#039;t, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait... what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, okay, get this.&quot; Putting her glass down, Twilight spread her hooves out. &quot;We&#039;ve just imprisoned Discord, and all the ponies are worshipping us as gods. Typical, so far. Mac decides he&#039;ll be in charge of the judiciary branch of the government, I&#039;ll get executive, and the lawmakers will be mortal. So of course right off the bat the Wardens are formed to be my church and the Sages go off to follow him. With me so far?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, so about seven years in a law is passed that only Wardens and Sages can see us, cause the mortal ponies still view us as gods. I&#039;m not happy with it, and Mac doesn&#039;t seem happy with it, but it does prevent some of the more constant genuflecting.&quot; The unicorn shook her head. &quot;But Macintosh has some of his Sages start a few rumours. A sentence here, an argument there.... I don&#039;t know, I was too busy carrying out my duties to even notice. In about two hundred and thirty years, nopony believes we exist.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack stared at her friend. &quot;Ah.... wait, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight burst out laughing. &quot;He, hahah, he managed to get us relegated to pagan gods! Yeah, the Wardens and the Sages still existed but aside from a core council, most ponies believed that the Blind Warden and the Silent Sage were just holdovers from less &#039;enlightened&#039; times! I didn&#039;t even know until five hundred years after Discord when I finally decided to take a walk outside and got compliments on, on my costume!&quot; She snorted. &quot;Of course I was a tad miffed at first but the more I thought about it... If I didn&#039;t need to banish Mac then I wouldn&#039;t lose the connection to the elements, and Discord&#039;s prison wouldn&#039;t weaken, and, well, things were actually a lot calmer. Mac and I took to travelling Equestria to help out where we could--we did check back into Canterlot every decade to remind the Councils we existed, but other then that nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmer stared at her friend. &quot;Seriously. That... he did that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I know! Craziest thing.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was pretty common knowledge throughout the multiverse that loopers were, practically speaking, near demigods. True, they didn&#039;t always use their power and a number of them actively restrained themselves from appearing out of the ordinary to the non-looping populace. But when a pony has subjectively lived a few hundred millennia, using their time to study magic and gather technological trinkets, it wasn&#039;t at all difficult to set up a network of invisible spies around an ancient fortress, sabotage a stack of magical rings without leaving a trace, and watch the whole thing from the comforts of a home in a tree shaped library.</p><p class="double">Twilight sipped her tea as the events on the magical screen played out again. Ahuizotl had his rant, left Daring in a death trap, and went to complete his evil plot. Daring struggled free, but not in time to stop Ahuizotl from placing the final ring.... which didn&#039;t do anything, thanks to Twilight&#039;s own sabotage. Then the creature would carefully examine everything about the ancient doomsday device, Daring would burst in, dramatic fight scene.... Daring flew away.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is the fifth loop this has happened,&quot; Twilight muttered, taking notes. She tapped her hoof thoughtfully, remembering her search of high end museums and being surprised to find &quot;replicas&quot; of artefacts from the series. The Sapphire Stone statue, the Griffon&#039;s Goblet – everything that the books said Daring had sent to a collection was actually <i>in</i> a collection, somewhere, though often a very secure and private one. Even stranger, though, were the people she encountered in her investigations; right out of the books themselves, Daring&#039;s extended family, various enemies and allies... Nothing for it but to say the books were true.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d have to ask Celestia about her cameo in some of them...</p><p class="double">&quot;Why would A.K. Yearling say this was fictional?&quot; Twilight pondered. &quot;I mean... who is A.K. Yearling anyway?&quot; That had been the single gap in her investigations. The author of the series was only known through her publishing company. Yes, there had been the biography snipped in the back, but they were generic and, upon investigation, had no supporting paper trail. That led to the inevitable conclusion that A.K. Yearling was a fictional persona... but whose? </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.5</p><p class="double">Keeping secrets from friends sucked.</p><p class="double">That, Applebloom was sure, was the truth in any universe.</p><p class="double">“So,” Sweetie said, grinning. “&#039;nother loop without us, huh? Do anything good?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom answered the grin, as well as she could. “Main thing was actually hundreds of miles away – ask Twilight about that. All I know is that, because we&#039;d moved to Appleloosa before the loop itself started, the Element of Honesty got a new bearer.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Scoots nodded. “Tell us more!”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not going to believe this...” Applebloom paused for effect. “Gilda.”</p><p class="double">“No!” Diamond Tiara covered her mouth with a hoof to hide her giggles.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Applebloom replied, shaking her head. “From what Twilight put in her letters to me, she and Dash and Pinkie were involved in basically a permanent prank war from the moment the Nightmare Night thing died down to the moment the Loop ended.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, what was her element like?” Scootaloo asked, curious. “You know, the whole user friendly thing. Twilight and Trixie tend to get crowns, the other girls get necklaces, Spike&#039;s one is a gorget with a flame on it... Gilda doesn&#039;t have a cutie mark, so?”</p><p class="double">“Necklace, I think.” Applebloom shrugged. “We only went back to Ponyville once for a meeting with Filthy Rich, so I didn&#039;t have much chance t&#039; look around. Could ask Twilight.”</p><p class="double">She sniggered. “Filthy looked a bit run ragged, actually. And there was a crater in the main square which I think was Pinkie&#039;s fault.”</p><p class="double">Diamond gave Applebloom a glower. It didn&#039;t work. “That <i>is</i> my father of whom you are speaking...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, so?” Applebloom winked. “We all laughed at Princess Maccie, didn&#039;t we?”</p><p class="double">She stopped, suddenly feeling uncomfortable.</p><p class="double">“Anything else happen?” Sweetie asked, after a moment.</p><p class="double">“Nothing really important.”</p><p class="double">After so long living with the Element-bearer of Honesty, the lie slid out as smooth as silk.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I did do a bit of research into nanotech, though,” she supplied, trying to get onto slightly safer ground without lying any more. “Should help in building my workshop without needing to keep half my pocket full of the heavy machinery.”</p><p class="double">“Neat.” Scootaloo nodded. “It&#039;d be good if we could get some aircraft carriers built next time we play battleships, actually.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m pretty sure that this stuff would let us build fleets if Cookie can run it right,” Applebloom mused.</p><p class="double">“So!” Sweetie clapped her hooves. “Did you get a cutie mark for it?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Applebloom said, clamping down on her nervousness. “Nothing special.”</p><p class="double">Another lie.</p><p class="double">The mark in question had been a golden spanner, with what looked like the same patterns-made-of-patterns that the Jain egg had had.</p><p class="double">It hadn&#039;t stuck around past the Loop refresh, though, which sunk that idea – but Cookie had just that morning confirmed that the ascension had, indeed, left a permanent mark on her magic.</p><p class="double">A little twist of non-native pony type magic – some pegasus, some unicorn – ready to expand out on command, and with the proper catalyst. A catalyst like Smart Cookie.</p><p class="double">Testing <i>that</i> would be a very, very bad idea. After all, she didn&#039;t know how to reverse it...</p><p class="double">“Okay, so, what&#039;s next for this loop?” Diamond Tiara asked officiously.</p><p class="double">“Ah vote we sleep through class an&#039; get perfect marks,” Applebloom suggested.</p><p class="double">“Good start,” Scootaloo allowed. “But needs something more. Diamond, any ideas?”</p><p class="double">“Is Chrysalis awake?” Tiara pondered. “If so, we could set up a kind of &#039;kid superheroes&#039; thing... you know, barely-there cover identities, interchangeable minions and one monster once a week...”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll supply the ridiculously conspicuous base,” Applebloom volunteered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you mean you can&#039;t take me to her?&quot; Twilight Sparkle boggled.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie smiled. &quot;Exactly what I said. I Pinkie Promised not to reveal her location or identity to anyone.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash growled in aggravation. &quot;And how many loops ago was this?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Doesn&#039;t matter! A promise is a promise is a promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, something IMPORTANT is happening here. And A.K. Yearling is at the centre of it. Can you... give me a hint, maybe?&quot; The alicorn smiled wearily. &quot;Please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Tell you what. Her birthday is in two weeks. If you can completely disconnect any sense of direction you have, no magic compass or anything, you can be the mare in the cake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll do it!&quot; Rainbow interjected.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</i> Twilight snapped around. &quot;SERIOUSLY?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, what&#039;s a little embarrassment compared to awesomeness?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, it&#039;s settled then!&quot; Pinkie quipped brightly. &quot;Oh this is going to be so much fun!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.6 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Harry King was a successful scrap metal merchant, in part because he was willing to take risks. For example, he&#039;d invested in recycling and benefited from ever increasingly strict laws. His yard could even strip down aircraft and handle the more exotic metals such as tungsten and titanium. As a result, he got a lot of specialist trade, and those same metals were worth a lot more than most.</p><p class="double">He was in his office, a double storey affair made out of 40 foot containers but upgraded considerably, overlooking the main yard. He was finalising one such deal, with an outfit that called itself Nightlight Industries. From his checks, a brand new company specialising in &#039;new developments in transportation and industrial processes&#039; according to their website. Looked like one of their first deals had involved acquiring some wrecked aerospace gear and now they wanted to sell what they couldn&#039;t salvage. There was always good stuff in those.</p><p class="double">The terms of the contract they suggested were agreeable, even generous, and they&#039;d even agreed to pick up the delivery costs and import duties. While there was always the possibility of some kind of scam when you got a juicy contract like this, the payment, a percentage of the profits was due only after he&#039;d processed and sold the materials. They were also liable for any disagreement over title. In short, he was golden, and he&#039;d sent through the signed contract only a couple of hours ago.</p><p class="double">Now he was on the phone with their deliveries staff, a girl by the name of Twilight. Crazy names some people hung on their kids these days, and not the sort of name you heard in connection with heavy transport vehicles. At least that&#039;s what he&#039;d assumed when he heard the interference on her mobile phone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, so where in your yard do you want me to deliver? The first load of 100 tons is ready,&quot; she said.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve cleared out bay 3 for your trucks, someone at the gate can direct you when you get here. You have the address in your GPS?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Got it up on Google maps, and I can see it clearly. Bay 3 is that one two down from the entrance?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, you people certainly seem pretty on the ball.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve found it doesn&#039;t pay to let the grass grow under your hooves. Okay, it&#039;s clear of obstructions...&quot;</p><p class="double">That made him do a mental double-take. &#039;Hooves?!&#039;</p><p class="double">There was a bright flash and a fading purple glow around a big pile of scrap metal with an undeniable high-tech look to it that had appeared in bay three. Exactly what it had been was unclear as it was made up of finely divided pieces. Hovering over it was a floating figure, a purple pony of some kind wearing an orange coverall and white hard hat. She glided down on outstretched wings and walked towards the site offices. He absently noted that the hard-hat had a hole for a spiral horn. Wait, hadn&#039;t he heard his daughter going on about something like that in Japan?</p><p class="double">The UK had suffered minimal raids by the invaders, but that didn&#039;t stop several of his workers from freaking out and running as fast as they could in the opposite direction. The rest just stood there in stunned surprise. The phone he&#039;d dropped in his distraction spoke, and he snatched it up, fumbling it before he finally got it to his ear.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, you can check it yourself, but there&#039;s a minimum of 100 tons of stuff there. Not sure how much natural debris got mixed in, but it&#039;s mostly nickel iron anyway, so it should be all good.&quot; It was the same voice, and as the purple alien approached, he could see a mobile phone held up against her head with no visible means of support, and her mouth moving.</p><p class="double">He responded in the most eloquent and concise manner he was currently capable of. &quot;Gaaah!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry? Look, I know I&#039;m not what you were expecting, but you signed a contract, I delivered on it, now I&#039;m coming up there to get your signature on the delivery receipt.&quot; The voice gave a long-suffering sigh. </p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, alien purple alicorn. I get that a lot. But I&#039;m not one of those invaders, I&#039;m just here to fulfil a business contract. If I was all &#039;Grr&#039; and &#039;Argh&#039; and &#039;kill, maim, destroy&#039; then you&#039;d have some comeback, but since I&#039;m not, can we both at least <i>try</i> to behave like reasonable adults?&quot; </p><p class="double">He could hear her climbing up the exterior stairs to the office level as she spoke, but it was the unvarying calmness of the voice as much as anything that kept him from panicking. The outside door clanged and there was a squeak from outside and the voice said, &quot;And your secretary fainted, just perfect! It seems legal secretaries are made of sterner stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was an echo to the voice which indicated the speaker was just outside. &quot;May I come in?&quot;</p><p class="double">He put down the phone. &quot;Could I stop you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, if you say &#039;no&#039;. But that would make it hard to get your signature on the delivery note. I could always just blind teleport it through the door to you, or just leave it out here and go off for a coffee if you feel uncomfortable. Celestia knows I could do with a cup. Having people run away in terror when you say &#039;hello&#039; can get kind of depressing.&quot;</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t sound like some ravening monster out to suck his brain out through his eyeballs, so he decided to once again take a risk. &quot;Okay, come on in.&quot;</p><p class="double">The door opened and the purple unicorn trotted in. Under other circumstances the big eyed creature in overalls would have been adorable. Her horn glowed, and an electronic tablet levitated out of a pair of saddlebags. It floated over to him, and she said, &quot;Sign in the highlighted boxes please.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dumbly, he took the stylus and signed under the eyes of the alien, who was watching with an expression of alert interest. &quot;I know this is a lot to take in, but hopefully you&#039;ll come to see that I&#039;m just a differently shaped person. One who you can do business with.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought I was doing business with Nightlight Industries.&quot; Harry was finally coming out of his state of shock, and wondering about what other surprises he&#039;d end up having to deal with.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are.” She tapped the coverall which he could now see had a logo similar to the contract he&#039;d signed. “Legally I&#039;m not a person, so I had to organise a company, a legal entity to act on my behalf. Well first I got a solicitor, a good one, and he fixed things up for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">That begged the question of why, but there was a more immediate concern. &quot;And is this even legal? Where did you get that stuff?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As of the Berne Decision of 2015, perfectly legal. As you saw I have powers, magic technically, and it allowed me to sweep all of low Earth Orbit clear of the junk that&#039;s accumulated, selectively to avoid active satellites and the inactive ones the Berne rules don&#039;t cover, but those are all intact and there aren&#039;t too many of them, so they&#039;re not a problem. I have all the rest balled up in an orbit 600 miles up, about 5000 tons in total; so if you&#039;re satisfied with this load, I&#039;ve got a lot more business I can do with you. I guess they haven&#039;t released the news yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">That had him reaching for the cabinet he kept his hospitality drinks in, then he decided he needed all his wits about him, and opened the side of the cabinet which had an instant percolator in. Almost automatically he offered, &quot;Coffee?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, thank you!&quot; There was genuine pleasure in her voice. &quot;Cream and two sugars please!&quot;</p><p class="double">He set the percolator going and turned back to face her, sitting down behind his desk. &quot;What&#039;s the Berne Decision?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d have thought you&#039;d know, it&#039;s more your field than mine. It used to be that even after a satellite had died and was just junk, it was still owned by the launching country or company. There was no right of salvage like there was at sea. But then you guys had a bunch of collisions, lots of damage and billion dollar payouts, and those owners decided they didn&#039;t want liability any more. Add to that the aliens blowing up even more of them, and you have all the ingredients for a major about face.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Berne Decision was signed just last year and was explained as an initiative to promote private space industry, and basically made satellites more than 2 years past their end of operational life legal salvage, along with parts of destroyed satellites. There was a big fuss from the Americans about somebody stealing technology, until some senator made a comment about paying out billions to protect technology less advanced than the game console he&#039;d gotten his niece.&quot;</p><p class="double">She grinned. &quot;Lucky break for me, or what I did _would_ have been illegal, and while I can&#039;t commit crimes, being an un-person, Nightlight Industries would have been liable. Everything in that pile is within the laws. So don&#039;t worry, all the legal stuff is taken care of. I even arranged for a customs official to come over from the local airport to certify it. Of course, she doesn&#039;t know the full story, but this is the de facto point of entry, and you, or rather I acted with all possible speed to comply with the regulations on metal importation, so you&#039;re covered.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled some papers from her saddlebag, and placed them on his desk. &quot;Certification, permits, it&#039;s all there and all filled out. I&#039;ve even included a paper with the relevant sections of the Berne Agreement and guidelines in case she hasn&#039;t boned up on them. I intend to do this again, and I want to make sure you want to do business with Nightlight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But why?&quot; The buzz of the percolator showed it had a full jug, and he mechanically got up and made coffee.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why am I doing all this? Because I want to help, and your world needs it. But having some mysterious space unicorn come in and solve problems with a wave of her horn would be only slightly less terrifying than the invaders. Better I use my powers indirectly and work my philanthropy through human agencies. But that requires money.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why am I doing it the way I am, showily rather than behind the scenes which would fit better with my indirect action strategy? Partly because it amuses me, and hopefully because it will amuse the humans who hear about it, at least if they have any sense of the absurd. A friend of mine once showed me that it&#039;s harder to be scared of something if you&#039;re laughing at it, or with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her telekinesis took the cup of coffee off the desk where he&#039;d put it, and she sipped. &quot;Ah! This planet has _good_ coffee! I intend to keep pranking the entire planet while at the same time helping out. Hopefully people will see not all aliens are like the invaders. Some of us have a sense of humour, and a sense of honour. Oh dear...&quot;</p><p class="double">There were flashing red and blue lights arriving at the entrance. &quot;Looks like one of your employees recovered enough to call in the riot squad. It&#039;s okay, I&#039;ve got this.&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to go, and Harry found himself saying, &quot;Wait! You&#039;re just going to walk right up to them? They probably have armed officers with them, wouldn&#039;t it be safer to just do that teleport thing and leave?&quot;</p><p class="double">That got him a brilliant smile, back over her shoulder. &quot;Thanks for thinking about me, but it&#039;s okay, I&#039;m not doing anything illegal. Like I said, I&#039;ve got this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Three police cars and a van pulled into the yard and started spilling out police officers, though none of them had guns. The police cars formed a barricade for the police, and one of them raised a loud hailer. &quot;Can anyone in the building hear me! Try to signal if you can. we have reinforcements on the way!&quot;</p><p class="double">Harry opened his window. &quot;I&#039;m fine, everyone in here is fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">The officer with the speaker, an otherwise relatively blameless individual by the name of Inspector Burns, called out. &quot;Sir, one of your employees sent us a video of an alien entering your offices. Has it hurt anyone?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, my secretary fainted, but I think that was just surprise. I believe she&#039;s about to come out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your secretary?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The alien.&quot; As if that was a cue, the exterior door opened and Twilight stepped out into the metal stairs, still wearing her overalls and hard hat, but also wearing over her wings a pair of giant foam rubber hands with a Nightlight Industries logo and &#039;#1&#039; on them. She pouted. &quot;And here I was ready to come out with my hands up. I&#039;ve watched your visual media, isn&#039;t that what police are supposed to say?&quot;</p><p class="double">The officer goggled at the sight, and the fact that the ravening alien monster their caller had told them about seemed to treat this as a joke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Stay right where you, lay down where you are and put...&quot; Burns stopped himself just in time, though in fairness he was going to say &#039;your hands behind your head.&#039;</p><p class="double">Surprisingly enough the creature complied and even spread her foam covered wings flat to the metal grid floor, though even across the yard they could see her roll her eyes. &quot;Um... am I being arrested? Because that&#039;s not legal. I&#039;m not a person, I&#039;m a working animal, I even have papers to prove it. The most you could do is call an animal control officer. Or the RSPCA.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We have! And the army, so don&#039;t get any funny ideas!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The RSPCA? But I wasn&#039;t mistreated, I even got coffee... I thought the foam hands were pretty funny, but okay. I&#039;m perfectly willing to comply with any reasonable requests by a duly authorised representative of the law.&quot; </p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and the wings vanished. All the police flinched. &quot;Oh, for Celestia&#039;s sake! I don&#039;t <i>have</i> hands, so I have to do everything with magic. Look, we can sort this all out if you just let me present my papers. If you don&#039;t want me to levitate them over to you, you can just come and collect them. I won&#039;t move, won&#039;t light up my horn or anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">Inspector Burns had to think. Risk the creature using it&#039;s powers for something else, or approach it. They weren&#039;t supposed to engage it, just establish a cordon and perform rescue duties if possible. None of his hasty orders had envisioned it co-operating. &quot;Send them over.&quot;</p><p class="double">Under other circumstances watching the folder full of paper floating across enveloped in a purple aura would have been fascinating. As it was, he watched the unicorn like a hawk until the folder landed on the bonnet of his car. He picked up the perfectly regular manilla folder and leafed through them. He wasn&#039;t an expert on such things, but it all looked properly legal. It basically said that Twilight Sparkle was a working animal for Nightlight Industries, like one of their own police horses. He had spent a year working in the mounted division so he had at least some idea what he was looking at. There was a veterinary certificate and everything seemed to be in order.</p><p class="double">“How the heck did you get a vet to sign off on you?”</p><p class="double">“One seriously surprised vet. He wasn&#039;t used to having a patient who could talk back. Used a couple of diagnostic spells on other animals to show how they worked, then cast them on myself. My, am I glad I helped my friend Fluttershy out at her animal shelter.”</p><p class="double">Inspector Burns started to ask for more information, then decided the answers would probably just complicate things even more.</p><p class="double">&quot;But if you&#039;re a working animal, shouldn&#039;t you have a handler?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m my own handler, I got a BTEC in Animal Management from the University Collage of Kent. It&#039;s all in there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, how? How could you enroll, how could you go to classes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Distance learning, I did it all over the internet, and I paid my course fees myself. On my home world I&#039;m a librarian, astronomer and magical researcher with the equivalent of multiple postgraduate degrees, and spells I developed specifically to help me learn faster, and <i>that</i> was when I was a plain old unicorn. I audited the course in three hours, and took the final exam right afterwards. Doesn&#039;t matter, it&#039;s an accredited school, and they didn&#039;t require me to demonstrate my person-hood, only my competence. Which since I got a top grade with distinction, I did.&quot;</p><p class="double">Burns noticed something else. &quot;It also says you&#039;re owned by Nightlight Industries... well you&#039;d have to be, but isn&#039;t that slavery? Even if you&#039;re not a legal person, you&#039;re clearly intelligent. That would make the company acting illegally.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s covered. It&#039;s a private share limited company, I own all the shares as I put in the initial investment and capital equipment, such as myself, there&#039;s plenty of precedent for an animal owning shares, even a controlling interest, but being legally incompetent, they have to have a human with power of attorney to manage them, my lawyer in my case. That means I own the company&#039;s assets, including myself. So I own myself, and that&#039;s not slavery, in fact it&#039;s the very opposite. I know it&#039;s convoluted and daft, but I don&#039;t fit in any of the regular categories, so loopholes are all I&#039;ve got.&quot;</p><p class="double">She shifted a bit. &quot;So, what exactly am I doing wrong that requires so many highly trained police officers to stop me? I delivered a load of scrap metals from the salvage I collected in orbit on behalf of Nightlight Industries, as required by our contract. At no time did I make a threatening action towards anyone on this site. The only crime here is wasting police time, and I wasn&#039;t the one who was responsible for that. Could I get up? My wings are starting to cramp.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were creating a disturbance.&quot; Inspector Burns was feeling as if he and the entire group of police had been made fools of.</p><p class="double">&quot;By existing? Surely that only applies if I was acting in a disorderly manner, and if I was a human. As an animal, animal control officers would be responsible for my capture, but that requires me to be acting in a dangerous manner. If this place has security cameras, it will prove I did nothing of the sort. So, please can I get up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Burns glowered for a moment, then nodded. &quot;Very well, but make no sudden moves.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight got up and flexed her wings, then stretched them out. “I&#039;m going to come down the stairs now...” </p><p class="double">She glided gently down the stairway before landing and walking slowly out into the open. &quot;Look, I know this must feel pretty silly, but you&#039;re not the ones who are responsible...&quot;</p><p class="double">A news van rolled up at the gate. &quot;... I&#039;ve seen the sort of things you expected to face in Japan, and you guys don&#039;t even have guns. That&#039;s not stupid, that&#039;s courageous! Could I have my papers back...? On second thoughts I&#039;ll make a copy, with your permission?&quot;</p><p class="double">Burns nodded, and her horn flashed. Suddenly there were two copies of the paperwork in front of him, and one set levitated back towards Twilight, captured by the camera crew that was just moving up behind the police cordon.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s only a manifested copy, not real matter, so it will disappear in about three hours. I&#039;d probably get it photocopied before then. Now, can I go? We&#039;ve established that you don&#039;t actually have grounds to hold me. I have other loads to deliver, other contracts to fill.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.1 continued (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;How in the name of Tartarus did you find me?&quot; the pegasus grumbled, glowering at the plate in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;d have to ask Pinkie,&quot; shrugged the other pegasus, tugging at a plastic hairclip. &quot;I&#039;m just the dancing girl.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I&#039;m straight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash snorted. &quot;And I don&#039;t swing at all. Honestly I think Pinkie wanted me along so you would feel &#039;justified&#039; in writing the Do series. &#039;I&#039;m your biggest fan, I&#039;d do anything for you...&#039;&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I know how that can get, so if you don&#039;t want that I&#039;m cool.&quot;</p><p class="double">The other pegasus peered over her glasses. &quot;Really. Do you have a fanclub?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmyep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What books have you written?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash chuckled. &quot;I&#039;m more an athlete then a writer, buuuuuut....&quot; She reached a hoof under the table, flicking through her subspace pocket and pulling out a duplicate of her own novel. &quot;Ever hear of Iris Drake?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her companion accepted the book, flicking an eyebrow up as she examined it. &quot;These are incredibly rare. And you&#039;re claiming to have written them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Even have the original manuscript, if you want to see it.&quot; Dash grinned. &quot;I did take some influence from your series, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm. I didn&#039;t see any saddlebags on you when you came in.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A wizard friend set me up with that trick.&quot; The athlete leaned back in her chair. &quot;Do you have any, uh, tips? People have been clamouring for a sequel but....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I just... write the stories as they come to me.&quot; The other pegasus tightened her cloak. &quot;Nothing special. I mean, yeah, the books are famous...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot; Rainbow nodded. &quot;I&#039;ve been in my share of trapped ruins, though. Pretty accurate.&quot;</p><p class="double">The older mare&#039;s eyes snapped up. <i>Gotcha.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;You... make a habit of entering ruins?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not exactly.&quot; Rainbow sighed. &quot;See, I was selected a while back, by &#039;fate&#039; or whatever, to bear an ancient artefact known as the Element of Loyalty. Course, that means when I hear the world is in danger I just have to rush off and save it, you know? Ancient libraries and collapsed coliseums, they&#039;re just places where I do my part. It&#039;s not so much a habit as... coincidence.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hrmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash flicked her mane. &quot;Crazy thing is, a lot of the ruins seem like they came right out of the books you write. Down to the tiniest detail. It&#039;s as if Daring was actually, you know, <i>there.</i>&quot; She smiled beatifically. &quot;Of course, Daring Do is fiction, so obviously I must be wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I mean, I would be pissed if Daring Do was hiding all this from the public for some silly reason, like... money, or fame. Privacy, that&#039;s a little more understandable. Maybe if some of the artefacts in the book can brainwash ponies who know about it, yeah, I&#039;d get that. But knowing the world was in danger so often and I was being left on the sidelines?&quot; Dash shrugged. &quot;I sometimes wished she <i>was</i> real, just so I could thank her for her brave deeds... then smack her for passing them off as children&#039;s literature rather then forming some sort of group to, I dunno, keep the dangers under control.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My family can handle that,&quot; the pegasus said, then clamped her mouth shut.</p><p class="double">Dash raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;....fine. You got me. I&#039;m Daring Do. The books are all... exaggerated, but true.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash remained silent.</p><p class="double">&quot;The thing is...&quot; Daring took off the soft hat she was wearing, revealing her monochrome mane. &quot;Saving the world, archaeology... it doesn&#039;t pay well. I originally wrote the stories in private to tell some family members, you know, swap tales over the fireplace. Then some publisher saw my Sapphire Stone transcript.&quot; She flung her hoof out. &quot;&#039;&#039;Great story, miss, mind if I make you rich?&#039; I made a snap decision, called myself A.K. Yearling... They refused to believe it was nonfiction. And, over the years, it just... built up. I never meant for it to become famous...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Celestia appears in one of your books.&quot;</p><p class="double">Daring chuckled. &quot;Heh, yeah. That was when I realized that my adventures were really important. Of course it wasn&#039;t nearly how I wrote it. I was completely panicking. But....&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash smiled as the pegasus rambled on, putting a word in here and there while the tiny bit of plastic clipped to her mane recorded everything. Twilight would have a ball. Or freak out. Maybe both. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So... as far as I can figure, baseline you is supposed to get miffed about the two month delay, decides to &#039;help&#039; Yearling write her book faster, then discover that she&#039;s actually Daring Do and somehow stop the whole Rings of Scorchero thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked at Twilight sceptically. &quot;And you got all that from a few dozen loops?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmm. Yeah.&quot; Twilight coughed. &quot;Most of which were lonely loops, soooooo....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh. Please tell me you at least got the book.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn gave her friend a sheepish grin. &quot;It&#039;s still a couple expansion periods out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....CLOROPHYL.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.7</p><p class="double">Applebloom had checked very carefully.</p><p class="double">This Loop was only about thirty past a recent loop length increase, according to Twilight, which should mean it was a while until it lengthened again. With that in mind, the moment the loop ended could be known quite precisely.</p><p class="double">Helpful for a new alicorn who had no idea how to undo the transformation.</p><p class="double">So, in the full understanding that there were only two hours or so to go, Applebloom pulled Smart Cookie from her subspace pocket as the last rays of the sun slid off the Canterhorn.</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go...” she muttered, slipping the Device/Founder on and tightening the strap. “Tree-questria, but I feel nervous.”</p><p class="double"><i>That&#039;s only natural,</i> Cookie replied.</p><p class="double">Applebloom peered over the drop below her, and gulped. At least a furlong straight down, and then an increasingly gentle slope coated in soft, fluffy snow. (It helped that some confused pegasi had dumped three feet of snow on the mountain earlier that week.)</p><p class="double">“Right. No time like the present.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom closed her eyes, and broke into a run.</p><p class="double"><i>Now!</i></p><p class="double">Hearing Cookie&#039;s alert, she gathered her hooves below her and pushed. The leap took her up and out, into thin air... then down, past where she&#039;d taken off from.</p><p class="double">She shut out the nagging part of her mind that was screaming something about mortality. (She was a Looper, it was allowed.) She also shut out the bit telling her that she was doing something stupid, which was harder.</p><p class="double">Don&#039;t think about it. Think... back.</p><p class="double">Remember the moment of excitement, the feeling of epiphany. The shining instant when an entire world of the nanoscopic lay revealed before her. No more tricks or traps, no more surprises hiding in the woodwork.</p><p class="double">Just... an enormously complex machine. Nothing more.</p><p class="double">And with that, ride the wave of sudden understanding.</p><p class="double">There was a timeless sensation of <i>depth-</i></p><p class="double">And her eyes snapped open.</p><p class="double"><i>Good,</i> Cookie said encouragingly. <i>Now, bring your wings up at an acute angle, then turn them to bite the wind on the downstroke!</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom bared her teeth in what wasn&#039;t quite a grin, but was too good natured to be a grimace.</p><p class="double">The explanation helped, actually. Cookie probably knew almost everything about her, but one of the most important things was that “do this” wasn&#039;t nearly as satisfying without the why behind it.</p><p class="double">After a dozen or so quick, flailing wingbeats, Applebloom had her glide trajectory stable. A few more, slower and with more thought into them, had her in the updraught rising as the Canterhorn cut into the prevailing winds, and from there she just had to hold her wings out and ride the wind.</p><p class="double">For maybe half an hour she just floated, silently contemplating the country below.</p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen it from this high,</i> Cookie said eventually.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Applebloom asked, experimentally trimming her wings to tack around. She flubbed it, slipping sideways instead of turning, and gave up before things got worse. “Whoa... yeah, now I think of it we ain&#039;t gone flying much.”</p><p class="double"><i>I have noticed a certain tendency to be busy on other matters whenever you and Scootaloo take up one of your creations,</i> Cookie noted. <i>But... it&#039;s an amazing sight, really. All our hopes and dreams become reality.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom tried again. This time, the more gradual approach worked, and they swung out to face towards Ponyville.</p><p class="double"><i>Look at that,</i> Cookie said, sounding a bit distant.<i> Ponies did that. The argumentative, hardheaded, hidebound refugees from a land buried under an ice storm of their own making. We came here, and we built this. All of this. Together.</i></p><p class="double">Cookie&#039;s words made Applebloom look at Equestria with new eyes.</p><p class="double">From her time in other worlds, she&#039;d seen what the average medieval society looked like. How most worlds developed, in fire and death and war.</p><p class="double">Equestria... didn&#039;t do that. No, the citizens of the land spread out beneath her wings had no need to fear war and little need to fear hunger.</p><p class="double"><i>That</i> was the real achievement of Equestria.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For the next hour or so, the duo flew on over the star-speckled night below, mirroring Luna&#039;s canvas above.</p><p class="double">“Time&#039;s nearly up,” Applebloom commented softly.</p><p class="double"><i>I know. Time for me to go back in.</i></p><p class="double">“Sorry y&#039;all have to do this, and all, but... yeah, it has to be done.”</p><p class="double">With care, Applebloom returned Cookie to her subspace pocket. While Cookie could almost certainly ride out a loop reset and be resummoned from her shared place in Applebloom&#039;s soul, neither of them felt particularly inclined to test it out.</p><p class="double">Alone now, Applebloom checked the time once more.</p><p class="double">One minute left.</p><p class="double">Acting on a whim, she closed one wing, flipped over, and went into a dive.</p><p class="double">It was easy to see why Dash and Scoots loved speed so much. There was a thrill of adrenaline which you only really got when air was rushing past you, whipping at coat and mane and tail.</p><p class="double">She was nowhere near Sonic Rainboom speeds, of course – that tended to take a lot of effort even for experienced pegasi – but, well, it was fun.</p><p class="double">The last seconds of the Loop ticked away-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">42.8</p><p class="double">-and Applebloom Awoke, skidded on the floor as her galloping legs suddenly got confused, and ended up in a heap against the wall along with several other ponies.</p><p class="double">“Ah, horsefeathers,” she heard Scootaloo say. “That wasn&#039;t the smoothest awakening...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, stupid wings,” Sweetie muttered. “I got confused again and...”</p><p class="double">Sweetie tailed off.</p><p class="double">“Again?” Diamond Tiara asked, extricating herself from one end of the pile and coming into Applebloom&#039;s vision.</p><p class="double">She had a pair of wings, and a filly-scale <i>horn.</i></p><p class="double">Applebloom felt her own wings itching, and pulled them out from underneath... probably Sweetie, from the direction of the voices... before getting off the others.</p><p class="double">She was an alicorn. In front of the others. Though, actually...</p><p class="double">Scootaloo had a new horn on top of her usual wings.</p><p class="double">Sweetie had wings, adding to her normal horn.</p><p class="double">She and Diamond had <i>both.</i></p><p class="double">And Nyx, now revealed to have been all but flattened underneath all four of them, was her everyday alicorn self.</p><p class="double">Relief ran through her. If this was a peculiarity of the loop, like that time Mac had been Princess Maccie, then she could retain her secret-</p><p class="double">Then what Diamond had said penetrated. Sweetie had had trouble with her wings <i>again?</i></p><p class="double">“It&#039;s nothing,” Sweetie said quickly. “Just a loop a while ago where I was a pegasus!”</p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t have been a while ago,” Tiara pointed out reasonably. “You&#039;d have told us, right?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie blushed.</p><p class="double">“Who ran me over?” Nyx asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">“I think all of us,” Scootaloo said. “Sorry. Anything damaged?”</p><p class="double">“Just bruises, I think...” Nyx twisted herself from lying on her side to on her front, then came to her hooves in a surge of movement. “Ow.”</p><p class="double">Tiara looked between them. “Hang on a minute... have you all ascended before as well?”</p><p class="double">“As well?” Applebloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo chorused.</p><p class="double">“Gourd, have we <i>all</i> been hiding it from one another?” Tiara sighed, as one by one all the others apart from Nyx nodded slowly. “Guess this is what happens when we don&#039;t want to make one another feel small... you know, if I was still the boasting type this would have gotten resolved a <i>lot</i> quicker.”</p><p class="double">“How long?” Applebloom asked, drawing the eyes of the others. “I mean, how long have you guys been... able to be alicorns,” she finished, looking down.</p><p class="double">“About five loops,” Scootaloo admitted. “Sorry, guys.”</p><p class="double">“Eight,” Sweetie said.</p><p class="double">“For me it was four,” Diamond Tiara said, sitting down.</p><p class="double">“Just two.” Applebloom shrugged, feeling even more uncomfortable. “It was the one with the nanotech, yeah. I kinda understated how complicated the nanotech was when I told you...”</p><p class="double">“I think we&#039;ve all been less than honest about our recent loops.” Diamond Tiara rubbed at her temples.</p><p class="double">“I haven&#039;t,” Nyx said brightly. The others glared at her.</p><p class="double">“...okay, sorry,” she added, shrinking back. “I kinda forgot how bad it makes you feel, when you think you&#039;ve let down your friends.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t-” Scootaloo started, then sighed. “Yeah, you&#039;re right. I do. And part of it is that that loop felt kind of like a dream. It all seemed so unreal, but when I tested it out... there it was.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s mouth twisted. “I didn&#039;t dare test whether I could do it again except at the end of the loop, because...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know the feeling,” Applebloom said, to the nods of the others.</p><p class="double">“Were you flying as well?” Sweetie asked.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shook her head. “Telekinesis spell. I&#039;ve seen you do it so often, Sweets, and I... it&#039;s so different to my cloud manipulation. I was concentrating on that when the loop changed, so I wasn&#039;t ready.”</p><p class="double">“I was flying,” Applebloom volunteered. “First time I&#039;d tried.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie smiled. “It&#039;s amazing, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">“Hey, this means I can teach you!” Scootaloo said with a grin. “Well, so long as being an alicorn myself means that I can actually manage level flight without magic...”</p><p class="double">“Far be it from me to interrupt,” Diamond Tiara said into the lull, “but what exactly about this loop made us all be alicorns?”</p><p class="double">They scanned the so-far-neglected loop memories.</p><p class="double">“...oh,” Nyx said, then giggled. “Poor Momma...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight carefully signed the final bit of paperwork for the day.</p><p class="double">“Right, that&#039;s done...”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, your majesty,” the seneschal said, lifting the pile in a magical grip.</p><p class="double">“No, thank <i>you,</i>” Queen Twilight rejoined. “I&#039;m grateful to you for your help. Now, I should go see what my... five daughters,” she said with a wince, “have managed to get up to during office hours.”</p><p class="double">Frankly, if they were all Awake, she was lucky the castle was still standing.</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>43.1 (Bobnik)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle sighed and shuffled a hoof. “I s&#039;pose it&#039;s story time. Since it sounds like I went first, I&#039;ll go first here too.”</p><p class="double">“No, no, not yet. If there&#039;s gonna be stories, I want snacks. Just like old times, in the clubhouse.” said Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">“I got this.” Nyx trotted over to the door and had words with a guard out in the corridor.</p><p class="double">Sometime later they sat around an array of healthy snacks and one cupcake each (it appeared Queen Mummy had given the kitchens some very specific instructions).</p><p class="double">“Okay,” began Sweetie Belle. “Mine didn&#039;t happen in Equestria. Lots of the others been to this place, but I didn&#039;t recognise it at first...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle opened her eyes and stared into what appeared to be a formless void. <i>Oookaayy,</i> she thought, and swiftly patted herself down to check it was just the void that was formless.</p><p class="double">Phew. Hooves, mane, tail, horn, various other bits, all present and correct. Her next considered action was to retrieve a jewelled necklace from her subspace pocket and fasten it securely around her neck.</p><p class="double">“Clover? You okay?” asked the unicorn, somewhat creeped out by the total lack of echo.</p><p class="double"><i>Yes, I&#039;m fine</i>, replied the Device. <i>Where are we? All I can sense is a formless void, and you.</p><p class="double"></i>“Oh good, I&#039;m not hallucinating. We might start things off with a search spell – did you hear that?”</p><p class="double"><i>Something, yes...</p><p class="double"></i>Both of them stayed silent as the merest whisper of sound began, and swelled imperceptibly slowly over time into music. And oh, what music it was; the very grandest of orchestras, with all the musical instruments Sweetie had ever heard and then some, all played by the greatest of virtuosos. It was joined by a choir of all the different voices that she could imagine, male and female, all up and down the scales.</p><p class="double">Sweetie&#039;s eyes widened as the realisation hit her – this was being performed live and improvised on the fly. The core theme was there, solid as bedrock, but all the voices and instruments were adding their own flourishes and additions. The music wove back and forth like life itself. She heard debates of philosophy, parties, storms, the happiness of new love, the solemn joy of a mountain vista and multitudes of other things beyond even her extensive experience. She somehow knew this music would stay with her and she would be able to hum the refrain for all the new things she would see in her life to come.</p><p class="double">It was too much. Music was in her heart and almost always in her cutie mark, itself an extension of her soul. With a deep breath and a hopeful heart she opened her mouth and joined the song.</p><p class="double">The reaction was immediate. Stern tones sung by baritone voices washed around her, interrogating. Drums and horns called warning that they were ready to defend. Sweetie very carefully restated the main theme in her own natural register, hoping to send the message that she didn&#039;t want to interrupt or hijack the marvelous music, but join in and add her own notes. Gradually, gently, the voices relented and the drums quieted. Lighter tones swirled around her and invited comment, granting inclusion. The unicorn was welcomed into the song.</p><p class="double">How long Sweetie sang she never knew, then or later. Entirely immersed, she sang along with the music, even adding her own themes, mostly about friends and family. However, it gradually became apparent that one of the male voices was trying to start up it&#039;s own version of the primary theme. It was loud and brash and very, very repetitive. The main singer wasn&#039;t letting it evolve, wasn&#039;t letting it grow and change like the earlier theme did.</p><p class="double">For the first time in what was probably an age, the filly fell silent and listened. In this new song she heard selfishness and foolish pride, the desire to be the best and a buried uncertainty as to the purpose of the singer. She heard the fear of change. There was Diamond Tiara before the loops, with cruelty to hide the low self esteem. There was the worst parts of Rarity, the greed for attention and reputation. Even herself, and her once-buried fear that she would never find her purpose, her talent, her cutie mark. Worse yet, a group of other voices were beginning to join in.</p><p class="double">No. No, she wouldn&#039;t let this happen. The music she&#039;d been part of was far too beautiful to allow this kind of thinking to take hold. Not while she drew breath.</p><p class="double">With renewed resolve she dove back into the song, weaving back and forth until she was hard up against the rogue choir. Sweetie didn&#039;t attack it directly because that would only make it stronger, but instead tried to weave the brassy notes into a foundation of a new theme. Every time though, her song faltered because the singers would not accept novelty or change. <i>You want stasis? You want everything to stay the same? Try this.</p><p class="double"></i>Clover responded to her unspoken thought, and became a harp under her hooves. Sweetie sang of unchanging repetition, the fundamental frustration of the Loops. She gave them her millennia of aggravation at being wrenched from the natural pattern of pony life, and the sorrow of family and friends who simply couldn&#039;t keep up. All of this was of the same core as the rogue song and merged with it seamlessly.</p><p class="double">Many of the voices split away and rejoined to original music; they could not accept the price of what Sweetie sang. But the original voice of the disharmony sang on, in foolish pride and stubbornness.</p><p class="double">The filly changed tack at this point. Already enmeshed with the music, she began to introduce the hope and joy that she had found in the Loops – new discoveries and new friends. How anything new and different was not a challenge to supremacy but one of adaptation. Harp became dulcimer became drums became flute became harmonica became hang as she adapted to the needs of the moment. Clover helped by weaving the sounds of the previous instruments back through Sweetie&#039;s current recital, showing how the old could be adapted to the new. Slowly but surely Sweetie Belle became her own orchestra.</p><p class="double">Pride and stubbornness broke, and the once loud voice became soft and tried to hide in shame and fear. This too, Sweetie would not accept; she bolstered the voice and provided support, inviting him to share in all the new wonders they could create together. Friendship did not just add but multiplied the possibilities – why would you settle for loneliness?</p><p class="double">It seemed the male voice agreed. It accepted her offer, and together they sang a new theme, drawing heavily from the original. This third music had all the strength of the male voice with the flexibility of Sweetie&#039;s, drawing in more voices and instruments until with a mighty crescendo of unity, the song came to an end.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle opened her eyes and blinked. Around her now was a court filled with humanoid creatures. Kneeling before her was one of the larger and more impressive looking men, with tears running down his cheeks.</p><p class="double">“Thank you, whoever and whatever you may be; you have saved from a path of great darkness.” he whispered. Sweetie did not reply with words, instead she just hugged him.</p><p class="double">At an unseen signal, the crowds drew back allowing Sweetie to see a great throne at the centre of the hall. A man rose from it, and in his eyes was fire and wisdom.</p><p class="double">“I am Illuvatar,” he said. “I wrote the core of the music you have sung, and as I wrote I saw horses, and creatures with horns, and beasts with feathered wings. But never did I see them all in one form. Though I do not wish to be rude, for you have taught Melkor what I could not, I must ask: Who and what are you, and from whence did you come?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Sweetie Belle.” <i>Wait, WINGS?</p><p class="double"></i>She looked down the sides of her body and sure enough, a pair of wings were there.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, eucalyptus. How am I going to explain this to everypony?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“So then I kinda had to explain all about the loops, &#039;cause I&#039;d already sung about them. Everyone was like &#039;How can this be?&#039; except for Olorin, turns out this was like his fiftieth loop. Pretty sure he&#039;s the anchor.” Sweetie paused for a sip of apple juice. “I didn&#039;t really have time to think about being an alicorn then, but it came in handy later.”</p><p class="double">“How so?” asked Applebloom. “Was it because the Middle Earth loops are dangerous? Ah&#039;ve heard they can get pretty bad with nasty soul magic and stuff.”</p><p class="double">“Nope, nipped all that in the bud by making friends with Melkor. It was because of time; Middle Earth lasts for tens of thousands of years. I wouldn&#039;t have lived to see the first sunrise without it.”</p><p class="double">The other fillies stared at her. “You&#039;ve already spent millennia as a alicorn?” asked Applebloom in a faint voice.</p><p class="double">“Well what else was I supposed to do? I&#039;m not even sure if you can use Star Swirl&#039;s spell without being a Bearer of Harmony. So whose turn is it now?” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">43.2</p><p class="double">“Right.” Scootaloo polished off her cupcake. “My turn, I think.”</p><p class="double">She broke off, and looked down at the cupcake. “Okay, seriously, does... well, mom... have Pinkie or the Cake family on staff? That was delicious.”</p><p class="double">Nyx frowned. “I think she might have <i>a</i> Pie or <i>a</i> Cake on staff, past loops are strange like that.”</p><p class="double">“So, spill,” Sweetie said, lying on her front and putting her head on her hooves. “What <i>did</i> you do? Scoot through time?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Scootaloo shook her head. “Nothing so simple as that. But it <i>did</i> work with what always tends to be my Talent.”</p><p class="double">“I think it did for all of us...” Applebloom hazarded. Diamond looked a bit ambivalent, but after a moment nodded more firmly.</p><p class="double">“Right. So, we had a school trip...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo was bored. Pony was she ever! Twilight was awake, obviously, but it seemed like every other looper she knew had decided to sit this one out, including the Crusaders and Dash. At least she had Pansy to talk to, inside her own head. As they were walking through the Weather factory in Cloudsdale, that&#039;s exactly what they were doing.</p><p class="double"><i>This is amazing!</i> The Founder turned Device exclaimed, using her awareness to sightsee. <i>The pegasi of my time would never have conceived of weather construction on such a scale!</p><p class="double">It is kind of cool.</i> Scootaloo rarely ended up in Cloudsdale, even now that flying was no longer an issue. Even with some of the things she&#039;d seen in other loops, the giant cloud generators and rainbow distillation towers were pretty cool. <i>It&#039;s a change from doing the Canterlot Gardens tour. The last time the three of us did that we decided to fix Discord with a bucket of liquid rainbow, some cloud and a feather...</p><p class="double"></i>She trailed off as her brief good mood faded, and she looked back and forth between her non-Awake friends, or... ponies who just looked like them. How Twilight had coped when she was alone her first few hundred loops she didn&#039;t know, and never wanted to find out.</p><p class="double">Pansy had clearly spotted her incipient black mood, and tried to head it off by talking about something else. <i>So why did Miss Cheerilee bring you here instead, anyway?</p><p class="double"></i>Scootaloo looked ahead to where their teacher was leading the pack and talking to the guide. <i>She realised that since we have a unicorn in town who could mass cast a Cloudwalking spell, it would be educational to come see how weather was made. We got delayed due to freaky weather, and then Twilight and Dash got called off to Canterlot, which says Discord is about on time...</p><p class="double">I can&#039;t believe you&#039;re so blasé about that creature!</i> There was the sharper tone of the soldier Lieutenant Pensee had been, and still was in a way, came through in her mental voice. Scootaloo had learned a lot about pegasus fighting techniques from the ex-Founder, and more about military theory. Considering the number of times she&#039;d been dumped into a fused loop as a fighter pilot, or mechanised soldier, it seemed like a good idea.</p><p class="double"><i>Discord&#039;s mellowed out a lot when he&#039;s awake, and when he&#039;s not, Dash or Twilight can handle him like small change. They&#039;re probably already duking it out with him, Twilight said something about seeing if the non-awake Elements could resist him...</p><p class="double"></i>They were walking out across a suspended walkway across a vast hangar where rows of massive rain clouds were ranked like dirigibles, undergoing final quality control inspections before being shipped out. Suddenly there were screams from the floor as two of the larger clouds sprouted arms, legs and faces, and stood up, slamming the other clouds to bits as they howled like Windigoes.</p><p class="double">There were plenty of screams and whimpers from up on the balcony too. As Miss Cheerilee called for her class to calm down and get together, in preparation for making like a North wind and blowing this place, the cloud workers got their act together and tried to marshal the two cloud creatures with cloud prods and blasts of air driven by groups of pegasi wings.</p><p class="double">In response, the two monsters turned and vomited high pressure jets of liquid rainbow from the dark holes that served them as mouths. They blasted the workers away and plastered them against the walls of the hangar, trapped like flies in polychromatic amber. Then one started to turn towards the gantry, and the panic increased. They were never going to get off the walkway in time without a distraction...</p><p class="double">Scootaloo wasn&#039;t really thinking, just reacting as she realised this. She spun on her forehooves, bucked a cloud board covered with production schedules – snapping it off its support – and yelled out, &quot;Bloom, Sweetie! Get the others clear! I&#039;ll cover you!&quot;</p><p class="double">She sprang up, wings buzzing as she backflipped onto the board in mid-air and spun it round to face the monsters, even as she started to fall. She waved her wings and forelegs, hollering &quot;Hey, look, a distraction!&quot;</p><p class="double">It worked, the monster turning its attention from the frantic foals on the walkway to the descending pegasus and spitting it&#039;s rainbowy goodness at her. Scootaloo used her improbable acrobatic skills to evade, strafing from side to side and bouncing off scraps of the destroyed clouds to arrest her fall and change direction.</p><p class="double"><i>What are you doing!</i> Pansy exclaimed in her head.</p><p class="double"><i>Improvising!</i> Scootaloo replied with the small faction of her mind that wasn&#039;t focussed on not getting hit. <i>Could use some help...</p><p class="double"></i>Pansy&#039;s default necklace form appeared around her neck and the improvised surf board took on a much sleeker form factor. Both creatures had spotted her now, and were alternating between bursts of rainbow and clumps of cloud from the ends of their arms big enough to engulf her if they&#039;d hit. Not that they would, as she&#039;d reached the ground level and was skimming back and forth amongst their feet with her wings buzzing. </p><p class="double">Her new ride wasn&#039;t a scooter, or the custom Extreme Gear Apple Bloom had made for her, but with Pansy helping her support the shape and cushion it against contact with the cloud floor it made a dandy substitute. She could feel the board under her hooves as if it was a part of her, the kinesthesia that made her such a skilled acrobat mixing with her pegasus cloud control abilities to extend into the cloud board itself.</p><p class="double"><i>Your friends are getting every-pony to safety, </i>Pansy&#039;s voice spoke in her mind. <i>If you wish to continue this, we should lead these things away from them.&#039;</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;On it!&quot; Scootaloo chirped, and swept around in a curve to head towards the door of the hangar. Still weaving and jinking to evade their attacks, she pushed out her cloud sense further into the cloudstuff that made up the floor. The hangar doorway opened out onto a wide gap, a dock where a cloud could be moored, between it and the next quay, which lead towards a warehouse. The cloud at the edge of the hangar rippled and shifted, forming a ramp leading off into the void and a lip to either side.</p><p class="double">The cloud monsters stomped after her, shapeless hoofs raising sprays of cloud and &#039;poomph&#039; sounds as they hit the floor. Scootaloo put on a burst of speed and went scooting up the ramp, soaring out into open air. She could fly, but as long as she just used ground effect stuff she could push all that extra effort into manoeuvring. </p><p class="double">She glanced behind her with a grin as the two cloud monsters reached the edge and tripped on the low wall she&#039;d formed, falling forward with windmilling arms. The grin faded as they simply floated forward off the edge, swimming after her. She could sense Pansy&#039;s mental smirk, and huffed &quot;Okay, I know, clouds, they can fly! But you&#039;ve gotta admit, it looked cool!&quot;</p><p class="double">She landed on the far dock and forced the cloudstuff on the far edge into a quarter-pipe ramp which she used to change direction, skirting up and grinding along the edge. A bolt of lightning disintegrated the cloud stuff directly behind her, telling her the stakes had just gone up. She frantically veered and weaved as she shot forward onto the main cloud yard in front of the warehouse. </p><p class="double"><i>We must not allow those things to get in among other ponies! </i>Pansy advised<i>. Though why there are no guards come to help I don&#039;t know.</p><p class="double"></i>As Scootaloo dodged a particularly nasty lightning bolt, she nodded towards the main bulk of Cloudsdale, visible over the warehouse. Even from here there were audible screams and sounds of panic. &quot;I guess they have their hooves full. Which means it&#039;s up to us...&quot;</p><p class="double">She dipped her wings, letting momentum carry her forward and body weight move her from side to side. She touched the wingtips to the ground and cloud scraped up to coat her wings and spread over her body. In seconds she&#039;d formed a layer of cloud armour over her leading edges and body, and Pansy poured power into it, making it as resilient as crystal. </p><p class="double">Using her wings to renew her speed, she then flipped end for end and swept her wings forward and flung a pair of Vortex Strikes, one of her standard attacks from her Jewellery Scout days, focussed bursts of air that could punch through wood – or even stone – or simply knock back an enemy. In this case they blasted holes right through one monster&#039;s torso, which healed up quickly.</p><p class="double">Pansy was watching through her eyes, noting the pattern in which they fired off lightning bolts. <i>They have a rigid pattern of attacks, and seem simplistic automatons. If only we could exploit that regularity...</p><p class="double"></i>A near miss with a lightning bolt frizzed her mane, and Pansy said, <i>Warehouse wall approaching!</p><p class="double"></i>Suddenly Scootaloo had an idea. &quot;That may be just what we need!&quot;</p><p class="double">She mentally threw the idea at Pansy and got back a mix of agreement, admiration and incredulity.</p><p class="double"><i>It will take precise timing...</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;Timing I can do...&quot; She flipped back and sped up, reaching down into the underlying cloud to twist the warehouse wall into a ramp that curved up and over in a soaring arc. Even as it stabilised, she hit the ramp and shot up it, gaining speed and feeling the beat as the blasts kept coming. Arcing into the open air, she tumbled and spun to keep herself from getting hit while keeping her path on course and on time.</p><p class="double">She fell between the heads of the cloud monsters just as their blank eyes charged with arcs of lightning, and the two creatures ended up blasting each other in the head. Scootaloo had hoped simply to disorient them, put them off balance long enough for Pansy to set up and go full Device, but it seemed that whatever else, they weren&#039;t immune to each other&#039;s lightning blasts.</p><p class="double">Each disintegrated the other&#039;s head, and the two bodies wobbled and collapsed, with Scootaloo shooting out from between them even as they disintegrated into tufts of cloud rubble. She swung sideways and skidded to a stop, spraying up a fan of cloud stuff that evaporated away in a sparkle of rainbows.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! That&#039;s what you get! Coming along here all big and bad and scaring every-pony! Well who&#039;s the pony? Yeah! Who&#039;s the pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled out an all-day sucker she&#039;d been saving from her saddlebag and popped it in her mouth, grateful for the sugar boost. &quot;Now that&#039;s what I call weather control.&quot;</p><p class="double">The cloud underhoof shook, and she groaned. &quot;Oh great! Not more of them!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy&#039;s voice spoke, and she felt her attention being directed to the rest of Cloudsdale. <i>I think it&#039;s rather more serious...</i> The topless towers were shuddering and leaning, and the very cloud under her hooves started to sink like an express elevator.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no! Dash must have refused her wings back! But I never thought Discord would actually do it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pansy could read her thoughts and the memories behind them as they flashed through her brain. Her voice was grim as she responded. <i>Then we must think of something with the utmost speed, or Cloudsdale will fall!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>For a few seconds, Scootaloo wondered if her crystalline advisor wasn’t being a little over-dramatic. After the initial shock, she remembered that Cloudsdale was inhabited by pegasi, and therefore they could escape. And falling clouds weren’t amongst the most lethal of objects. And even if Cloudsdale was destroyed, the multi-coloured reset button (a.k.a The Elements) would fix it as soon as they were used. Then she thought of her class and the other non-pegasi, would they get to a flying cart or safe cloud in time…</p><p class="double">She suddenly noticed a certain lightness just behind her shoulder blades, and saw the specks of distant pegasi abruptly stagger in mid-air and plummet downwards. Thankfully they were over the city proper, and should at least have a soft landing. The same couldn’t be said for the city. They were dropping out of the sky and drifting southwards as they did, towards the rocky chaparral that was bisected by Ghastly Gorge.</p><p class="double">As a final counterpoint to the distant destruction, one of the storage towers near the warehouse collapsed, and liquid rainbow started leaking out, eating away at the cloud-stuff under it. It was a highly useful by-product of cloud manufacture, with dozens of alchemical and industrial uses, and it was also extremely volatile under the right or rather wrong conditions. Scootaloo had learned great respect for the substance after several attempts by Apple Bloom to use it as a mono-propellant in some of her sounding rockets, with mixed and frequently Trixie-worthy results.</p><p class="double">While she’d only been listening with half an ear during the tour, she knew that the weather factory had millions of litres of the stuff in storage, along with storm clouds freshly charged with lightning and massive cloud crystal accumulators chock full of the weather magic to run the weather-making processes. When this thing hit the ground, all that would be jumbled together, and she had no idea what would happen… actually she had an excellent idea, what she wasn’t sure of was just how big the blast radius would be.</p><p class="double">It seemed whatever the Elements had done had infuriated the Avatar of Chaos way beyond normal. He hadn’t killed anypony yet, probably because dead things were no fun to abuse, but it looked like he wanted to. For just a second, Scootaloo felt despair wash over her, the position seemed as hopeless as any she’d ever been in, and even if the loops would reset it, here and now these ponies, her friends would die.</p><p class="double">She felt ashamed of her earlier dismissiveness, these versions of Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle – even Diamond Tiara – might not be the ones she’d lived out the loops with, but they were her friends in this time and place… well, perhaps not base-line DT, but looping DT had given them a bunch of advice on how to deflect her… but that wasn&#039;t important now. Anyway, she wouldn’t leave even base-line DT to such a fate, not that she herself wouldn’t share it. But that wasn’t important, the only important things was to protect the others, no matter the cost.</p><p class="double">Her teeth gritted and her anger rose. Take away her wings? Ha, she’d spent centuries without the power of flight, she could cope. Part of her ability to manoeuvre her scooter came from the fact that being unable to fully express her power through her wings, she’d compensated by pushing it through her hooves, making her scooter a part of her flight magic. It also meant, after untold years of practice she was <i>really</i> talented at cloud manipulation, which was how she’d pulled those stunts.</p><p class="double">That gave her an idea. After all, Cloudsdale was just a giant cloud when all was said and done. Maybe… She pushed her store of magic as deeply into the cloud as she could, and felt it as if it was a part of her hooves, but only the yard and some surrounding buildings. Her thoughts had only taken a few seconds, but even so she could feel the ancient weather magic weakening. She tried to fill the gap... and her power alone wasn&#039;t enough.</p><p class="double">“Pansy, help me!” The Founder within the Device added her own magic and that of the one-time sapphire, now transformed to something other by the magic of an Alicorn Creator. Scootaloo felt her reach expand, but it was tenuous, weak, feeble. She could feel the hooves of panicking pegasi, sense the terror, even where her class cowered near where their hired dirigible had been. But she couldn’t affect the cloud, as soon as she tried it vanished from her grasp like smoke.</p><p class="double">She needed a better connection, and Pansy offered an idea as to what, something ancient pegasi warriors had done in battle. Scootaloo hadn’t taken classes with Zecora, but she’d picked up enough from Apple Bloom to see why it might work. Her magic twisted slightly, and an icy spike punched up from the cloud in front of her. Wincing in advance, she brought the hock of one foreleg on it’s point, puncturing her skin and allowing a trickle of blood to form from the wound.</p><p class="double">She rubbed her free fore-hoof in it, then rubbed the bases of the hooves together before slamming them into the cloud again. Sacrifice, giving something to get something. Sympathy, the water, magic and iron in her blood mingled with the water and magic of the cloud, making it a part of her and her a part of it. Contagion, every droplet of Cloudsdale had been in contact at some point, and now her blood, was a part of that. Identity, the magic she was pouring into the clouds flowed outwards in a torrent, diffusing to the furthest reaches of the city. She no longer felt Cloudsdale under her hooves, she <i>was</i> Cloudsdale.</p><p class="double">The sensation staggered her for a moment, then she accepted it and flexed her non-existent wings, straining to impose her will on the vast expanse of cloud and slowing the city&#039;s descent as two suburbs extended fans of cloud to either side. Then she threw every scrap of power she had into creating upward thrust. She&#039;d once created a hypersonic lifting body ramjet out of pure weather magic, and driving the air flow underneath the city to push it up was a similar thing on a much bigger scale.</p><p class="double">Her new awareness also let her sense the tens of thousands of wingless pegasi running around and panicking, not to mention her own class - abandoned by their dirigible, and huddled near the airship docks. The rate of descent had slowed, but she couldn&#039;t create enough thrust to arrest it and they were still dropping at far to high a speed, and running out of sky.</p><p class="double">She needed to gain more control, more lift and calm ponies. Unfortunately Cloudsdale was about as aerodynamic as a brick... Wait, could she even do that? Well, there was only one way to find out. She shifted some of her power into moving the section of cloud she was on. It was like shoving a mountain with her bare hooves, but it moved, just as she&#039;d sculpted the wings earlier.</p><p class="double">She focussed a tiny amount of magic into a structured wind spell, and throughout the city, ponies heard a sensible sounding mare&#039;s voice. “Emergency recovery procedures now in effect. All ponies must secure themselves. Prepare for modular transformation. Converting Cloudsdale to aerodynamic flight mode.”</p><p class="double">Driven by her magic, pads of cloud complete with girth straps popped up like mushrooms across the length and breadth of Cloudsdale. As Scootaloo hoped the suggestion of doing something, anything brought them out of their panic. Ponies started strapping themselves, or helping foals or elderly ponies who were having trouble. Now she just had to pull off the rest of it. She&#039;d flown the Marecross once, which is what had given her the idea. She pulled a pair of goggles once given to her by Rainbow Dash out of her subspace pocket manifesting them on her forehead. She slid them down and was ready for action.</p><p class="double">Sections of Cloudsdale shifted over one another, reconfiguring themselves as they formed a new shape, a broad wedge with a contoured underside, the bottom half of a lifting body. The buildings above spoilt the effect, but Scootaloo had probed the contents of the warehouse and had a plan for that. It&#039;s doors flew open and bolt after bolt of finely woven cirrus flew out under tightly controlled winds, flying up and unrolling to cover all of Cloudsdale in a TPing of the gods. However, rather than sinking down they stayed up, acting as pathways for Scootaloo&#039;s power, being supported and supporting it.</p><p class="double">In a few more seconds they&#039;d formed a sculpted dome to match the underside, the top half of a broad, wedge shaped lifting body. The big cloud generators had been shifted to the back and were running full tilt, not generating enough thrust to push that lift positive, but enough to help slow their rate of descent still further to a gentle powered glide. It also allowed her to focus her own weather magic on holding the whole thing together, and providing guidance.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo now stood at the prow of the wedge, looking forward. Her awareness was entirely focussed on the clouds around her, at one with Cloudsdale as she poured her very soul into guiding it. If she&#039;d been able to look at herself, she likely wouldn&#039;t have recognised herself, weather magic swirling in blue and white outlines around her, creating the highlights of a non-existent pair of wings and a horn.</p><p class="double">They were still heading over Ghastly Gorge, almost following it&#039;s line. If they fell across it, even Scootaloo&#039;s efforts wouldn&#039;t prevent the city from breaking its spine. She had to get away, either land it in the dessert north of Appleoosa, or bring it all the way round and go for the fields north of Ponyville. The first was easier, but it would leave them stranded well out in the dessert, far away from rescue, whereas the second would put them close to Ponyville and the Elements which could fix things, as well as a more hospitable environment for the already abused cloud-stuff.</p><p class="double">She made the decision, it looked like she was going home. She gathered her will and altered the shape of the clouds slightly, and Cloudsdale tilted slightly and began to come round in a gentle curve. Much as she&#039;d love to do a screaming turn, that would wreck the cloud structure and injure ponies. As she felt trepidation rise in the other ponies, she broadcast another message with a gentle breeze.</p><p class="double">“Cloudsdale is making a circle to the north. Seeking safe landing zone. Please remain secured.”</p><p class="double">She&#039;d turned to port to bring the city out over the open desert, and reconfigured the underside and wings to grab every extra pound of lift from the thermals rising off the hot sands. For the first time, Cloudsdale was actually rising. She took advantage of it by making a miles wide circle to grab as much height as possible before heading north.</p><p class="double">The stress of sustaining the city and controlling it&#039;s movement were telling on her, but she refused to acknowledge it. Her body felt like it was burning with a cold fire, and it was getting harder to stand, but she was going to stay the course, whatever it took. The sense of Pansy&#039;s will merging along with hers, equally steadfast, kept her going, that and the sense that her friends were safe.</p><p class="double">They swept north across the Everfree forest, and for once it seemed to help, the chaotic magic of the place flowing into her. She drew on it as she had everything that would sustain her a few moments more. In moments Ponyville came into sight, relatively unaffected by chaos, which implied Twilight had kept things contained around Canterlot. However, there was a problem. She&#039;d flown everything from a Sopwith Camel to a Star Destroyer (New Republic) and instincts from decades of flight time said it wasn&#039;t going to get her clear over Ponyville. She had to find a few more seconds of hang time...</p><p class="double">Her eyes lighted on the cotton candy clouds – those could work! Finding reserves she never realised she had, she reconfigured on of the cloud generators back to it&#039;s original purpose and thrust it out on a pylon overhead, pointing at the clouds. It spat out tightly wadded balls of cloud, containing the Everfree magic she&#039;d just absorbed, which hit the cotton candy clouds and exploded in a precise formation. Together they formed a ramp, wide enough to support Cloudsdale.</p><p class="double"><i>One last effort! </i>she thought at Pansy, and got a wordless affirmation. Tweaking the trajectory of the descending city, she put everything she had into giving it one last shunt as they hit the edge of the ramp. She&#039;d done the same on her scooter countless times, and that reflex served her well now. The city hit the ramp and shunted up, soaring over Ponyville with metres to spare.</p><p class="double">But that last effort had hammered the pegasus at the centre of it all. She collapsed, wings sagging to the cloud as a wave of fatigue hit her. Even her head seemed heavier than usual. But she held onto consciousness by the skin of her teeth, or there was one last danger. As it was they would land in a high speed uncontrolled skid, and the entire city might topple or even roll over, or the cloud stuff might rip apart. There was no landing gear to lower, however there were other ways.</p><p class="double">But she found just enough energy to make one more change. The under-surface shifted, sides coming down to form a flattened arch as the city reached only metres above the grass. The front edge was sculpted upwards to form a venturi that would scoop air underneath. The city kissed the ground and kept going, surfing along on the ground effect as the dome peeled away and formed a vast parachute behind it.</p><p class="double">The city slowed, dropping as its speed went below stalling for the ground effect, but by that time they&#039;d almost stopped. They finally came to a rest on the meadows beyond Ponyville and Scootaloo collapsed. “Thank you for flying Cloudsdale airlines...” she mumbled muzzily.</p><p class="double">She was utterly spent, barely able to breath. The last time she&#039;d felt like this, she&#039;d been dying. When she glanced down at Pansy, even the gem at it&#039;s heart seemed dull and lustreless. But she sensed rather than heard Pansy&#039;s proud whisper, <i>Well done soldier. Well done...</i> Her last memory before she faded out was of using her fading awareness of the city to check on her friends and her class, and finding them safe. It was more than a fair trade.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She awoke, and heard the sounds of distinctly medical beeping in the background. The ceiling that came into focus had an equally medical appearance. Not Ponyville central, this looked more cloud based. That, and the lack of new loop memories hitting her implied something she wouldn&#039;t have put a plugged bit on, that her awakening came with a small &#039;A&#039;.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not dead?” she asked, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p class="double">“Nope! But you gave it your best effort!” Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice responded. “Worst case of magical exhaustion the docs ever saw. Luckily Twilight came up with a way of transferring some of my magic into you, something about being kindred spirits. Though I don&#039;t know if even I&#039;d have been crazy enough to try fly a city to safety!”</p><p class="double">Her voice turned serious. “Seriously, thanks, kiddo... Scootaloo. I never thought even Discord would do something like that. I&#039;d have never forgiven myself if saving Equestria came at the cost of destroying Cloudsdale... Oh, that&#039;s right! You don&#039;t know what was going on...”</p><p class="double">She finally turned her head to look, and there were her parents -she had parents this time, not a sure thing – Twilight, and of course Rainbow Dash. She realised her neck was bare, and sent a frantic thought inwards. <i>Pansy! Are you okay?</p><p class="double"></i>The Founders voice was weak, but steady. <i>Fine, though don&#039;t expect anything above a light show for the rest of the loop. I dropped back into your subspace pocket when you fell unconscious. Besides, you have other things to worry about.</p><p class="double"></i>Dash had stepped back and let her parents in. There was a tearful reunion, with adequate helpings of hugs. However, she could sense there was something they weren&#039;t telling her. Plus they seemed to be avoiding looking at her forehead. It certainly ached, she must have hit her head on something because it felt like there was a lump there. The pain on her fore-leg was more easily explained.</p><p class="double">Finally a nurse shooed them out, except for Twilight who said something about being on the Princesses&#039; orders. When the nurse left, she turned to Scootaloo and said, “I&#039;m sorry, so sorry you had to go through that. I had no idea this version of Discord would be so crazy-mean! He was more like Sombra, and when we finally hit him with the Elements he was completely destroyed. I don&#039;t know why, something different about his imprisonment, but that&#039;s not important right now.”</p><p class="double">“Well you could make it up to me by getting me a headache potion, I don&#039;t know how I hit my head so hard, but it hurts...” She managed to raise a hoof to her forehead, and found something she didn&#039;t expect.</p><p class="double">“I convinced them not to say anything right away, that I was the best person to help you. You&#039;re just feeling a bad case of magic burn from overloading your horn. It should clear up in a day or so.” A potion plopped into existence on the bedside table and Scootaloo eagerly scooped it up, popping the cork and gulping it down.</p><p class="double">“How...” The potion took away her aches and pains, but the question remained.</p><p class="double">“You pushed your powers to their very limits and beyond. Your Device is at least as powerful as a single Element, part alicorn magic and even part chaos as the alicorn in question was created by Discord&#039;s power. That was probably why you could affect things, his magic recognised it&#039;s own.”</p><p class="double">“Did I get a cutie-mark too?” Scootaloo automatically glanced towards her covered flank.</p><p class="double">“A cloud with a rainbow contrail.”</p><p class="double">“Oh foaly horse-apples! How many ponies know I flew the city?”</p><p class="double">“Language!” Twilight shook her head. “Pretty much all of Cloudsdale. Every-pony felt your weather magic flowing through the clouds, and it was easy to trace back to the source. It was probably the only reason they got you to the hospital in time to save your life. They&#039;re talking about asking you to be Princess of Cloudsdale, with a statue even.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo winced. “This just keeps getting better and better. Can you imagine what Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom will say? Not just the local ones, but the loopers? Please, you have to promise that you won&#039;t tell them. It resets when the loop does, right?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Yes. However, I want to add a proviso. If they become alicorns too, then I can tell them.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo thought for a moment, then said, “Okay, but it has to be all of them, Diamond Tiara too. She&#039;s one of us now, and I don&#039;t want her feeling left out.”</p><p class="double">“Agreed.” Twilight nodded. “As for your friends here and now, have faith in them. I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll support you too. And I&#039;ll be here to help you when your magic recovers. For now, sleep. You&#039;ve earned it.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Addendum (Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Before the hoof stomping could begin in earnest Princess Luna stepped forward, wings spread for attention. &quot;Before all can honour these Six Heroes, there is one more that must join their number in being recognized.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna lowered her wings. She wasn&#039;t using the full Royal Canterlot Voice, but enough of it to be clearly heard in even to the ponies standing outside the hall. &quot;When Discord found his scheme thwarted he sought to wreck a terrible carnage in revenge. He stole the wings off all the pegasi of Cloudsdale and set the city itself to fall. Certain whom the plummet did not slay the uncontrolled mixing of weather magics would.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna paused, not all had heard how dire Discord&#039;s finals acts had been, most having been confined to a relatively small area and relegated by tails to vicious pranks. &quot;But like the Legions of her ancestors one Filly would loudly shout NEIGH to the Beast&#039;s foul plan. None would come to harm while she still drew breath. So she pushed her weather magic and by her blood and will forged a miracle. She protected and comforted the fear of all in Cloudsdale, bringing the city in for a landing so that there was only one serious injury. That being herself, stretching her life and magic beyond any sane limits in the protection of others.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia hid a smile, Luna was truly a master storyteller still. Her duskier sister continued, &quot;Those who saw her said the magic glowed like a falling star. But her story would not end in the tragedy of such. Many laboured to heal her, and today I ask that Scootaloo Windfall, Protectress of the Open Skies step forth, to accept the thanks of those she saved.&quot;</p><p class="double">The main doors opened once more, and a filly alicorn stepped forth. The Pegasi and Nocturne Guards at the beginning of the aisle bowed deeply. Scootaloo had put her hoof down on more frilly outfits and adornment. Fortunately Luna had agreed and she was dressed in an outfit more like one of the Pegasi founders. Though more historically inclined ponies would notice the styling was closer to Private Pansy&#039;s than Commander Hurricane&#039;s. Her attempt to bow to the Diarachs was interrupted by Celestia&#039;s raised hoof. &quot;On this day you do not bow Scootaloo, we bow to you in thanks for saving Our little Ponies when we could not.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then to the shock of the herd, the Diarachs did just that. Then upon raising Luna&#039;s magic put a crown on her that somewhat resembled an open pegasi city-state helm. Presciently Rainbow Dash had been placed to Scootaloo&#039;s left in the ceremony. The older mare nudged her with a wing, &quot;Roll with the turbulence Scoots. Like Pinkie once told me parties like this are an excuse for everypony to celebrate they got to live through the danger.&quot;</p><p class="double">This advice was nearly undone when Celestia unveiled TWO windows in the Hall of Harmony. The first showed the stylized Bearers defeating Discord, the later engulfed in a mushroom cloud explosion. The artist was good, you could subtly see the various parts spread out at the edges of the blast. High above was... the lower surface of a lifting body?</p><p class="double">With a sinking stomach Scootaloo turned to the next window, which in a lower corner had Discord&#039;s defeat. The main area of the window was taken up by the reshaped Cloudsdale, Pegasis represented by wings turning to wisps of clouds. Her preascension self was standing like a figurehead on the prow. The artist even worked the glowing of magic to suggest her current horn, and her wing &#039;cloud wisps&#039; were larger and more solid looking. The impression that hers were growing and the artist was capturing the moment of ascension.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo fought off the urge to facehoof. &quot;The Crusaders are never going to let me live this window down.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">43.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Diamond said, nibbling on some lettuce. “I&#039;m pretty sure this was some kind of minor variant, just so you know.”</p><p class="double">“Join the club,” Scootaloo muttered.</p><p class="double">“Yes, we&#039;ve heard you,” Diamond replied. “It&#039;s my turn now. I&#039;m not just the daughter of a very rich pony now, you know, I&#039;m a Princess!”</p><p class="double">“And?” Applebloom, Sweetie Belle and Nyx chorused.</p><p class="double">“...okay, point made.” Diamond nodded, before pursing her lips. A little giggle escaped in spite of her best efforts.</p><p class="double">“Okay, okay, get to the action already!” Scootaloo said.</p><p class="double">“Right. Anyway. So.” Sitting down, Diamond looked along the row of... her four sisters, this time. (That was going to take some getting used to, and then probably a lot more un-getting-used-to.)</p><p class="double">“At first, it was fairly normal stuff. Just Twilight, Spike and I were Awake, so I spent a fair bit of the early loop comparing notes with him about telepathy. We were pretty sure I was up to P-3 or 4 on the scale, but that&#039;s not all that surprising with the amount of practise I&#039;ve been getting.”</p><p class="double">She waited for them to nod their achnowledgement.</p><p class="double">“The other project I had was basically trying to find some good, high quality crystals which might be suitable for a lightsaber.”</p><p class="double">“Isn&#039;t that my sister&#039;s thing?” Sweetie asked, then blushed. “Er, my normal sister, I mean.”</p><p class="double">“Ah&#039;m confused...” Applebloom frowned. “Are y&#039;all all Apples now, or am ah a Sparkle?”</p><p class="double">“We may be getting off topic,” Tiara reminded them. “Anyway. The reason was that Spike mentioned he&#039;d like a spare, and I wanted to... well, do something nice for him. It&#039;s that whole thing with a gift you&#039;ve put effort into, which isn&#039;t exactly a strong point of mine.”</p><p class="double">“Eh, you&#039;re getting better,” Applebloom said critically. “Though, t&#039; be honest, y&#039;all sharing your allowance helps too, we plumb don&#039;t have that much buying power most loops.”</p><p class="double">Diamond looked down. “Thanks,” she said, with a little catch in her voice. “It&#039;s nothing.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo made a sound of disagreement. “It&#039;s not nothing. It certainly helps me, for a start...”</p><p class="double">The pink alicorn nodded wordlessly.</p><p class="double">“So,” she said after a few seconds, her voice a little stronger. “Father and I went off to the frozen north on a skiing holiday I&#039;d asked for, so I could get a good look at somewhere that might be promising. And while we were there, the Crystal Empire returned not a furlong away from us. Of course I knew it came back, but it was so <i>close</i>...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is amazing,” Filthy Rich said, looking around the streets of the Empire. “It&#039;s like something from a story book – an empire from a thousand years ago!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Tiara replied, trying to be as enthusiastic as she <i>should</i> be feeling. But there was that continuous nagging ache in her mind, as the depression and gloom of the local ponies wore away at her empathic sense.</p><p class="double">Okay. How did it go normally? Twilight said that the first time they were here, Sombra turned up after a few days, and if they were feeling combative then the Loopers tended to use that time for setup.</p><p class="double">“Excuse me,” Rich tried to strike up a conversation with a nearby crystal pony. “Do you know if there&#039;s someone we can get information from?”</p><p class="double">The pony looked back at him with dull eyes.</p><p class="double">“Where did you come from?”</p><p class="double">No response.</p><p class="double">“We should try a library or something, Dad,” Diamond suggested.</p><p class="double">“Good idea.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right...” Rich said, frowning at the volume of local economic history he was reading. “So this <i>is</i> the Crystal Empire. I heard of it once, but I&#039;m pretty sure it was a bedtime story...”</p><p class="double">Tiara frowned, trying to glean more from the scraps of information she knew about the loop. There was something about a... festival? Granted, normally when she visited the Empire it was either visiting Cadence and Shining or going to the Games, but...</p><p class="double"><i>...a blue crystal</p><p class="double">shaped like the heart...</p><p class="double"></i>An image drifted through her mind, and she squinted for a moment as the psi-backlash hit.</p><p class="double">Being a P-4 wasn&#039;t exactly making it easy to concentrate.</p><p class="double">But if the ponies around here were all amnesiac, then maybe it would help them to have something to jog their memories.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you sure you can do this, crystal?” Rich asked, still a little confused.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Tiara replied, as they heaved the big lump of gemstone onto a hard surface. “My cutie mark&#039;s a diamond tiara, remember? Diamonds have to be cut. Maybe that&#039;s what it means – being a high-class jeweller.”</p><p class="double">(That had actually happened once. Though she&#039;d spent about half the loop being robbed by assorted comically bad robbers, and the other half talking with the various superhero-themed versions of her fellow Loopers to get the gems <i>back.</i>)</p><p class="double">“I think it means you&#039;re precious,” Rich said, smiling down at her.</p><p class="double">“Thanks, Dad,” she replied, smiling back. Then she turned to the big gemstone, and thought hard.</p><p class="double">Scratching her ear, she slipped Cubic Zirconium out of her &#039;pocket. <i>“Points of weakness?”</i> she subvocalized.</p><p class="double">Zirconium might have been a &#039;mere&#039; Intelligent Device, not a pony-in-a-computer like the Founders had become, but the Device was still very good in certain specialized areas – most of them relating to combat or analysis. A holographic map of points appeared in front of her vision.</p><p class="double">Two of them flashed, and Diamond nodded. Not all that far off where she&#039;d have picked herself...</p><p class="double">She turned her back. Winding up, she delivered an almighty buck to the first point, and cracks spread throughout the crystal. The second one, and it shattered into dust – apart from a lump about half her size, shaped like a heart.</p><p class="double">Rich gaped.</p><p class="double">“Ta-da,” Tiara said, grinning.</p><p class="double">After a moment more, her father bent down and hugged her.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t really think you could do it,” he whispered. “I think all parents hate thinking about their children growing up.”</p><p class="double">“No, don&#039;t,” she protested, blushing.</p><p class="double">“<i>You</i> did that, Diamond,” he replied. “And I can&#039;t ignore it. Well done.”</p><p class="double">Diamond leant into the embrace, smiling.</p><p class="double">After about another ten seconds, they broke apart. Diamond was still blushing, but beneath that her battle-hardened mind was analyzing the sensations coming through her telepathy.</p><p class="double">From a series of depressed nothings with the occasional faint memory, they were becoming stronger and clearer – near her, at least. Probably the operative phrase was more like “near the crystal”.</p><p class="double">“The Crystal Heart?” one crystal pony whispered, looking at the blue creation. After a moment, she blinked and looked away, as though she shouldn&#039;t have looked.</p><p class="double">Another walked slowly up to look at it, and another stab of half-remembered joy rushed through Tiara&#039;s head.</p><p class="double">Then everything else was swept away under a black tide of defeat and despair.</p><p class="double">“Diamond!” Rich cried, as she crumpled to the grass. “Are you okay?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, buck,” she managed, struggling to think. “He&#039;s early.”</p><p class="double">The happiness that had been starting to return collapsed, and Tiara felt adrift for a moment in a sea of foreign emotion before her training returned.</p><p class="double"><i>You are yourself. Anchor your shield on yourself. You are immovable. You are diamond-hard.</p><p class="double">I will not break.</p><p class="double"></i>Clarity returned, and with a strong pulse of effort she stabilized the mental shield.</p><p class="double">All the local ponies had fallen to the ground, she saw as she opened her eyes. Her father was still standing, not being sensitized to the magic, but she could see in his eyes that he was starting to feel it as well.</p><p class="double">Hooves clopped quietly on the cobbles.</p><p class="double"><b>“Crystal,”</b> King Sombra stated, approaching. <b>“Give up. Crystal.”</p><p class="double"></b>Diamond stood up.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">Black magic roared, this time directed straight at her. It had no physical presence, but slammed into her shield like a hammer.</p><p class="double"><b>“Crystal MINE! All MINE!”</p><p class="double"></b>“Get away from my daughter!” Rich shouted, charging towards the ancient unicorn.</p><p class="double">Sombra&#039;s eyes flicked to Filthy, and the blaze of dark magic doubled. One prong kept battering Diamond&#039;s failing shields, the other lashed towards Filthy Rich.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">The second spike of black magic splintered on another shield.</p><p class="double">Diamond felt a splitting headache come on, as she maintained a second mental wall – this one covering her father.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not a king,” she managed to say. “Rulers have to be worthy.”</p><p class="double"><b>“All my slaves!” </b>Sombra ranted, his magic growing still stronger.</p><p class="double">“No.”</p><p class="double">This time, it wasn&#039;t Diamond speaking.</p><p class="double">The first crystal pony to have noticed their ersatz crystal heart shook her head, focusing with difficulty on Sombra. “Not yours.”</p><p class="double"><b>“I rule here! All crystals MINE!”</p><p class="double"></b>On the last word, his magic gained a physical push. Diamond went flying backwards to hit the gem, the impact wooshing all the breath out of her lungs and leaving her fighting to breathe.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re not yours,” another crystal pony said. This time, the tone of voice was firmer.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not our king.”</p><p class="double">More and more blasts of dark magic coursed out from Sombra&#039;s horn, stabbing towards each speaker as they raised their voice.</p><p class="double">Diamond was still managing to shield all the targets, though her head felt like it was on fire, her back ached and she was starting to feel not all there.</p><p class="double">And she was still hearing thoughts. More and more of them, as the crystal ponies rejected Sombra one by one.</p><p class="double"><i>We don&#039;t have to listen to you...</p><p class="double"></i>“...and we don&#039;t want you here!”</p><p class="double">There was a rush of warmth, and then everything went black.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">Diamond&#039;s eyes wavered open.</p><p class="double">Twilight, Spike and her father were all standing above her. The scrunched up sheets both below and on top of her made her realize she was in a bed.</p><p class="double">“Thank Celestia you&#039;re okay!” Rich said, blinking back tears. “I was so worried.”</p><p class="double">“We all were,” Twilight said. “I have to say, I didn&#039;t see this coming...”</p><p class="double">“What happened?” Diamond asked, then shook her head. “I know about Sombra showing up, and the ponies saying they didn&#039;t want him, but I passed out.”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused, looking towards Filthy Rich. “Sorry, Rich, I think I might need to explain some things best kept secret. Feel free to ask her afterwards, but I&#039;m afraid that legally I can&#039;t explain with you in the room.”</p><p class="double">Rich looked unhappy, but reluctantly left.</p><p class="double">“Okay, spill,” Tiara said once her father was out of the door.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Twilight started, smiling mysteriously. “First of all, the rejection of Sombra by the Crystal Ponies seems to have banished him from the Empire entirely. I&#039;ll handle that more permanently later,” she added, reassuring Diamond that it would be taken care of.</p><p class="double">“What else?”</p><p class="double">“Right. That heart you made?” Twilight levitated up a bag, and opened it. A fine, sand-like dust of blue crystal grains hissed out.</p><p class="double">“This is about as much as was left,” she said. “Sorry. It couldn&#039;t handle the strain of being forced to do what the <i>real</i> crystal heart was designed for.”</p><p class="double">“Also,” Spike added, “you&#039;ve gone up about five P-rankings in one go from the overstrain. I&#039;m keeping you blocked now, but you may need some quick help to get your shields back to normal or you&#039;re going to hear every thought in eight furlongs.”</p><p class="double">“And, finally...” Twilight held up a mirror.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara stared at the alicorn filly lying in the bed.</p><p class="double">“...oh.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So she knew all about you?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“Pretty much,” Tiara said. “I asked her and Spike to keep it secret, because I really didn&#039;t want you guys jealous of me. Stupid, really...”</p><p class="double">“Wait.” Nyx pointed a hoof at her. “Does this mean you basically stole Cadence&#039; job?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Tiara shook her head. “Nope, nope, nope. It took me weeks to get away from the Empire because of all the hero worship. Cadence is welcome to it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">43.4</p><p class="double">“...so, yeah,” Applebloom finished. “I disabled a magical superweapon that was built to kill civilizations and harvested science from it.”</p><p class="double">There was general agreement that this was neat.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what now?” Nyx asked, finishing off the last of an orange.</p><p class="double">“Dunno, really...” Scootaloo admitted. “I mean, the whole cutie mark thing is kind of moot at this point.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a neat word,” Sweetie said. “Moot. It has a nice sound.”</p><p class="double">“Moot,” Diamond tried.</p><p class="double">“Moot.”</p><p class="double">“It totally doesn&#039;t sound like a word anymore,” Nyx pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, true. Okay, where were we?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Applebloom trailed off. “We&#039;re princesses now, right? What are we princesses <i>of?</i>”</p><p class="double">There was a long pause.</p><p class="double">“I think I&#039;m the Princess of the Night,” Nyx hazarded. “Possibly.”</p><p class="double">“We could just be too young for it, you know,” Diamond Tiara pointed out.</p><p class="double">The other three exchanged glances.</p><p class="double"><b>“CUTIE MARK-”</p><p class="double"></b>The apple cores, orange peels, cupcake wrappers, filly alicorns and nut shells went flying in the roar of gale-like sound.</p><p class="double">“Ow...” Nyx muttered from her position on top of a tapestry hanger.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rubbed her ears as she picked herself up. “Heh... Royal Canterlot Voice. Forgot about that...”</p><p class="double">Nyx spread her wings and floated down as the others righted themselves.</p><p class="double">“Right, no more CMC team shouts until we learn how to turn that off!” Applebloom said fervently, picking bits of nut shell out of her mane.</p><p class="double">“Sounds good. Er, or not...”</p><p class="double">“So, without the shout, what we were going to say was: Cutie Mark Crusader princess job finders,” Applebloom continued.</p><p class="double">“That works.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With some trepidation, Twilight opened the door to the room where her... daughters... had been spending the day.</p><p class="double">“Hi, girls,” she said, looking around. “Everything okay?”</p><p class="double">“Hello!” the five fillies chorused.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we were mostly swapping origin stories,” Applebloom said, subtly indicating her wings and horn.</p><p class="double">Twilight absorbed the message. “Okay, then.” She stepped further into the room, and closed the door.</p><p class="double">A guard made a noise of protest.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hush,” she said back at the closed door. “I don&#039;t think they&#039;re exactly likely to try to assassinate me, captain.”</p><p class="double">She turned back to the fillies, firing off a privacy spell. “So you&#039;re <i>all</i> alicorns? I knew about Scootaloo and Diamond, but not Sweetie or Applebloom.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, well...” Sweetie kicked the floor. “I kinda ascended in a loop where the anchor was not-you. Arda.”</p><p class="double">“Arda has an Anchor now?” Twilight asked, interested. “Last time I was there, we didn&#039;t see any.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s Gandalf,” Sweetie said by way of explanation. “And I kinda redeemed Melkor.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;s about how Olórin reacted afterwards,” Sweetie said, holding up her hooves to frame the image. “All &#039;well, I&#039;m too experienced to show it but I&#039;m also completely flabbergasted&#039;.”</p><p class="double">The others giggled.</p><p class="double">“I only Ascended that loop with Gilda as the Element of Honesty, and I was too embarrassed to tell you,” Applebloom said, looking down. “Sorry.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay, no harm done.” Twilight shrugged. “Right. Well, since you&#039;re all new to alicornification-”</p><p class="double">“Hey!” Nyx said, huffing.</p><p class="double">“...or at least most of you are,” Twilight corrected. “Nyx, you might need to help me help the others with what being an alicorn means. And I&#039;ve still got the job of running the country, so I might not have as much time to help you as I&#039;d like.”</p><p class="double">“No problem, momma. I&#039;ll show them what&#039;s what,” Nyx said with a salute. Then cracked up.</p><p class="double">“Hey, which one of us is going to be in charge of leisure activities?” Scootaloo asked. “I mean, that&#039;s a princess-type job, right?”</p><p class="double">“Dibs!” Sweetie said.</p><p class="double">“No way!” Scootaloo whirled to face her. “I challenge you to prank war over the title of Princess of Entertainment!”</p><p class="double">“I support Sweetie&#039;s bid,” Diamond announced.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;ve clearly got my hooves full this Loop,” Twilight said with a sigh. “Try not to wreck <i>too</i> many rooms. Oh, and there&#039;s a banquet an hour after sun-down, so make sure you&#039;re cleaned up and wearing your regalia.”</p><p class="double">“We have regalia?” the fillies chorused.</p><p class="double">“Check the Loop memories, it&#039;ll be there somewhere.” Twilight turned to the door. “Sorry, I really have to go. I&#039;ll try and make sure there&#039;s more free time on later days.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">All things considered, the banquet could have been a lot worse.</p><p class="double">The food fight had been almost expected, which was why the first course had been mostly foods served more for their suitability as throwing weapons than as royal fare, and the nobles walking out in disgust were mostly the snooty ones anyway.</p><p class="double">Or, at least, that was Twilight&#039;s story and she was sticking to it.</p><p class="double">The tree sap had been a bit much, though. And she&#039;d been looking forward to the cake, so seeing it spread over the wall (and part of the ceiling) when Applebloom tried to get herself a slice with telekinesis hadn&#039;t helped either.</p><p class="double"><i>This would be so much easier if I could hand half of it off to Cadence...</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='46'></a><h3>Loops 44</h3>
<br /><p>44.1</p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight said, her royal accoutrements in a pile against the wall. “I&#039;m fairly sure the way this loop would go in absence of our being Loopers would involve severe paperwork trouble on my part, the five of you feeling neglected, and complete chaos as you tried to act out. Possibly ending in Lunar time-outs.”</p><p class="double">“...hate to admit it, but that sounds about right,” Scootaloo said with a wince.</p><p class="double">“So. To solve this, I&#039;ve basically created half a dozen body doubles, and I&#039;m going to use them for paperwork. Understand this, girls.” She looked each of them in the eye, one by one. “However it came about, we&#039;re family for now. I might not necessarily be any <i>good</i> at it, and I know I can&#039;t replace your parents – in Nyx&#039;s case because I always am her parent,” she added with pedantic correctness. “But I&#039;ll do the best I can. Let me know if there&#039;s <i>anything</i> I&#039;m doing wrong.”</p><p class="double">The five fillies nodded, solemnly.</p><p class="double">Twilight returned the nod. “Thank you.”</p><p class="double">Then she formed an illusion in mid air. “Now, the first thing I think you need to <i>learn</i> – while you&#039;re all here to learn it – is Star Swirl&#039;s last spell. It&#039;s technically tricky, but you should get the hang of it eventually – and it makes it possible to go back from alicorn to any breed you want, so you won&#039;t accidentally get stuck in alicorn mode for a loop.”</p><p class="double">“Does this mean that new princesses aren&#039;t immune to homework?” Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">“It does indeed.” Twilight paused. “Well, in all honesty you probably know most of what you&#039;d be taught, so I think I can limit it to politics, magic and so on.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s something, at least...” Diamond Tiara sighed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo fidgeted in her regalia.</p><p class="double">She still wasn&#039;t used to it. Heavy bronze shoes, a presence chain (something Twilight had told them she&#039;d adopted from one of her brothers&#039; ideas, since it meant you didn&#039;t have to wear both a peytral and a coronet) and, for the occasion, a bronzed saddle.</p><p class="double">Still, at least bronze wasn&#039;t quite as silly a metal for jewelery as the solid steel Applebloom was wearing...</p><p class="double">“The firstborn child of the Gryphon Emperor, lady Gerta Cottomenes!” an usher announced. (She thought he was called Hard Voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;which certainly fit.) He then walked into the room, and turned. “The daughters of Queen Twilight Sparkle, the Princesses of Equestria. Applebloom, Diamond Tiara, Nyx, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle.”</p><p class="double">The young gryphon who walked through the door after him seemed about as overwhelmed as they were, which was nice at least.</p><p class="double">“Uh... hi,” she said, then winced. “Sorry. Greetings from the Heir-elect of the Gryphon-”</p><p class="double">“Nah, the first one was better,” Nyx said with a wink. “Don&#039;t worry, we don&#039;t care much about formality.”</p><p class="double">The usher looked quietly scandalized.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Er, okay...” Gerta frowned, thinking, then gasped. “Oh! Sorry, I forgot, I have to present a gift to the Heir Apparent of Equestria. It&#039;s a goodwill thing, I think...”</p><p class="double">She tailed off, as the five alicorn fillies exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Girls?” Sweetie said. “Huddle.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, who the buck is the heir?” Scootaloo whispered. “Did we ever work it out?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Nyx replied, looking sour. “I don&#039;t know what kind of succession law we have here yet, so that&#039;s no help.”</p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t we assume it&#039;s the firstborn?” Diamond Tiara asked.</p><p class="double">“Tiara, if y&#039;all remember <i>that</i> far back ah&#039;m astonished.” Applebloom shrugged. “Far as ah can tell, Twilight just treated us all equal. Even before we all Awoke. Ah&#039;ve got no idea who was born first.”</p><p class="double">“Hang on a sec.” Nyx stuck her head out towards the gryphon fledgeling, who was looking a little lost. “We might be a while, feel free to grab some juice or something.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight said, sitting in the centre of a semicircle of filly alicorns. “Star Swirl&#039;s final spell is one of his most impressive – and, for the majority of loopers, one of the most useful. The basic idea is related to relative amounts of earth pony, pegasus and unicorn magic.”</p><p class="double">“I think I know what you mean,” Applebloom hazarded. “After the loop reset which turned me back from an alicorn to an earth pony filly, Cookie could still detect a bit of pegasus magic and a bit of unicorn magic.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right,” Twilight nodded. “Technically, once you&#039;ve ascended and become an alicorn – or, for Nyx, Celestia and Luna, once you&#039;re born one – your soul is permanently that of an alicorn in a few subtle ways. You always have a tiny fragment of all three. What Star Swirl&#039;s spell does, when used right, is to change the relative amounts. It can&#039;t create magic from nowhere – and trying leads to... interesting results...” Twilight remembered the time she&#039;d accidentally scrambled her friends&#039; talents, and winced. “But since you all have a little of the appropriate magic already, you can just play around with the amounts to turn yourself from alicorn to a different pony type and back.”</p><p class="double">“So...” Scootaloo raised a hoof. “I can&#039;t normally cast magic...”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I&#039;m afraid that the step of going to a different breed of pony will always involve reascending to alicorn, and then undoing the spell again, so bear that in mind. I think your Devices all have the capacity for stealth spells, though?”</p><p class="double">Nods.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Nyx, would you care to demonstrate?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Nyx concentrated, flared her horn, and her wings disappeared. “Ta-da!”</p><p class="double">“Now reascend, please.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn paused, then reached into her mane. The odd clattering sound could be heard.</p><p class="double">“Nyx?” Twilight asked, concerned.</p><p class="double">“I haven&#039;t needed my pendant in, what, centuries! I forgot where it is, okay?”</p><p class="double">There was a crash.</p><p class="double">“Never mind...” Nyx withdrew her hoof, a gibbous-moon pendant in cosmic spectrum stone dangling from it. “Okay, here we go.”</p><p class="double">The room got momentarily darker, and Nyx was back to being an alicorn.</p><p class="double">“...okay, what just happened?” Applebloom asked. “That didn&#039;t seem, well, possible.”</p><p class="double">“My magic&#039;s kinda like that,” Nyx admitted. “Sometimes it makes unlight.”</p><p class="double">“Hay, before we forget,” Scootaloo asked, as Twilight started chalking magical formulae on the board. “What are we princesses of?”</p><p class="double">“Nothing yet,” Twilight answered absently. “I&#039;m the ruler right now, and you&#039;re all considered too young and inexperienced.”</p><p class="double">“That sucks,” Sweetie said with a pout.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll find our destinies eventually,” Diamond Tiara replied, then paused and put her head in her forehooves. “And now I sound like <i>you</i> lot...”</p><p class="double">Applebloom stuck her tongue out.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, I&#039;m going to <i>love</i> hearing the reason behind this one...” Twilight said, raising an eyebrow and keeping her hooves from sticking to the floor.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Applebloom started, shuffling her feet. Or trying to. They made <i>schlup</i> sounds when she moved them. “I thought that Princess o&#039; technology would be a good specialization, so I decided to try inventin&#039; fast food.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t see how that&#039;s technology...”</p><p class="double">“Well, the technology came in with the potato cannon, and the squash racket, and the maple syrup flamethrower.” Applebloom hovered over a fried splinter of potato. “It actually tastes quite nice. Sweet.”</p><p class="double">Twilight plucked it out of the air, and nibbled on it. “I see. Well, I imagine it may be an acquired taste...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, true. You get enough tree sap as often as we do and you kinda develop a palate for it.” Applebloom shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Be that as it may, we do need to get the wall repaired. Hypersonic potatoes aren&#039;t very good for the stonework, and I think you may have freaked out a couple of peckish gryphon guards.”</p><p class="double">Something exploded a short distance away.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked in the direction of the noise. “Any idea what that was?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom drew a circle in the puddles of syrup. “You know as well as I do that that was probably one of my sisters.”</p><p class="double">With a sigh, Twilight nodded. “You&#039;re right, of course. Out of interest, how does Cheerilee cope with you lot?”</p><p class="double">“Normally we don&#039;t have crazy new magic powers to explore?” Applebloom volunteered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.2</p><p class="double">“...well, that&#039;s that adage proven true,” Twilight concluded as she closed a medical dictionary. “Modern magic really does have a cure for everything <i>except</i> the common cold.”</p><p class="double">Spike sniffled.</p><p class="double">“Or perhaps we should call it the <i>un</i>common cold, because this clearly isn&#039;t a normal rhinovirus,” she continued. “Maybe Fluttershy could help?”</p><p class="double">“I dunno,” Spike said thickly, rubbing his nose. “Worth a try-”</p><p class="double">He inhaled massively.</p><p class="double">Twilight, suddenly having a moment of premonition, dove for cover.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“WA-CHOO!”</p><p class="double">Ponies in the market turned to look at where the loud sneeze had come from.</p><p class="double">They saw a large dragon tail poking out of the library wall, a large dragon leg sticking out one window, and a large head having smashed through the top floor of the building.</p><p class="double">Roseluck cleared her throat, coughed, and then screamed.</p><p class="double">That started the Standard Ponyville Stampede Mark IV.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, dis idn&#039;t gonna be fun,” Spike muttered, dabbing at his streaming eyes as he shrunk back to normal size. “I tink my age-shifting&#039;s on de fritz.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d noticed,” Twilight commented, standing up again from behind the counter. “Perhaps it would be better if we went to see Fluttershy now, because I don&#039;t think the building can take another sudden dragon expansion.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good to me...” Spike felt another sneeze coming on, and clamped his claws on his nose to hold it in.</p><p class="double">Twilight translated his look of desperation to mean “hurry up”, and fired off the teleport.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With a loud crunch-crash-tinkle, half a tree landed on Celestia&#039;s dresser.</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Day looked up from her Daring Do book. “Oh, dear. Spike had better have a good explanation for that.”</p><p class="double">She turned the page. “Ah, Azihuotl again. She does have something of a perennial problem with him...”</p><p class="double">The broken crockery could wait until she&#039;d finished the book. It was quite engrossing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...well, on the plus side, at least you missed Fluttershy&#039;s house?” Twilight tried.</p><p class="double">Spike put his enormous head in his equally large hands.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait!&quot; A reporter ran up, cameraman following, who locked his aim on Twilight. &quot;This is Joseph James, reporting live from King&#039;s Metal Reclamation in Robley, where police are in a tense stand-off with an alien... pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, I&#039;m pretty relaxed,&quot; Twilight responded, &quot;and it&#039;s more of a stand around.&quot;</p><p class="double">She manifested a plush cushion and sat down. &quot;Any-pony else want one? Okay, now it&#039;s a sit down. Actually, you talk to the Inspector over there, if I&#039;m going to be on camera, I&#039;ll get changed.&quot;</p><p class="double">A cloth screen appeared between them and her, and you could hear her humming. After a few seconds, the reporter turned away and had the cameraman focus on the police officer. &quot;Sir, who are you and what&#039;s been happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">That worthy was actually feeling pretty grateful towards the purple pony, as her distraction had given him time to think so he wouldn&#039;t come out looking like a complete idiot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Inspector Burns, Merseyside Constabulary. We were sent here in response to a call by a worker here that an invader had appeared and was about to attack. He&#039;d included smart-phone video, so we took the report seriously. We were sent here to rescue any survivors and contain the alien threat.&quot;</p><p class="double">The screen vanished, and Twilight stood there, now clad in her business-mare outfit. &quot;I&#039;m not a threat, though I&#039;m told I do get tetchy first thing in the morning before breakfast. My assistant Spike says it&#039;s because I pull all nighters and don&#039;t snack. However, they arrived and handled the situation with diligence, dispatch, dedication, and... a lot of other good things, at least one of which should begin with &#039;D&#039;... sorry, that kind of got away from me, carry on.&quot; </p><p class="double">The fact that the pony was now available to talk to made Joseph switch his attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;So who and what are you, if not an invader? There have been reports of a crea... individual matching your description appearing in Japan and Brazil. Was that you, and if so, what is your purpose here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right now? Delivering that load of scrap spacecraft parts I collected from orbit for recycling. In general, helping out. I was in Japan and Brazil, and now I&#039;m here in the United Kingdom and likely to stay here for a while, if I&#039;m allowed. In general, I want to help out. This planet has had a rough time even without the invaders, and I hope by generating wealth and then using it and my powers to aid people, I can both alleviate that and at the same time demonstrate my good will. As to who and what I am, I&#039;ve got a prepared statement here...&quot;</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed and her business briefcase style saddlebags twitched as she pulled out some note cards. A pair of wire rimmed glasses appeared on her muzzle, and she consulted her notes. </p><p class="double">&quot;My name is Twilight Sparkle, and I come from the land of Equestria on the planet Equus. It is a land of sentient ponies like myself, and home to many other races. And I was originally a unicorn. There are two other main races of pony, earth ponies with strength and earth related powers, and pegasi with flight and cloud control.&quot;</p><p class="double">A projected image appeared above her horn showing a street scene from Ponyville, and then Canterlot. Both were from a first person point of view, with Spike waling out in front of her and pointing excitedly at a bakery.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am not affiliated with those monsters you call invaders, and did not even know of their existence until after my arrival here; which was ultimately an accident, though something they indirectly caused.&quot;</p><p class="double">The scene changed to her study at the palace, littered with astronomical charts, books, blackboards with arithmantic notations and other paraphernalia. Princess Celestia was in front of her, looking at a star chart.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am a magical researcher and scholar, the protégé of Princess Celestia, co-ruler of Equestria, and an alicorn, one of the rare ponies who combines the traits of all three races, and trust me, the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts. I act as something of a trouble shooter for her. I&#039;m also well regarded as an astronomer, with multiple papers on both subjects to my credit. The ponies working on the Search for Extra-Equestrial Intelligence project had detected strong super-luminal energy surges from this part of the sky, and I was part of the team trying to discover their origin. I now believe it was an alien mother ship exploding.</p><p class="double">&quot;I developed a new generation of scrying spell using teleportation techniques that had interstellar range and could return images in real time, something of a breakthrough. Unfortunately when I tested it, it malfunctioned, due to the presence of a recently evaporated quantum singularity in the system. It overpowered the focussing array and caused an inversion. Rather than bringing the image to me, I was transported to the source of the image.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thankfully, I was in visual range of Earth when I emerged, and the residual atmosphere that had been carried with me could be contained by a forcefield, so I could survive long enough to get my bearings and teleport to the surface. However, it wasn&#039;t exactly my best landing. I was in shock and the sudden demand on my powers had made me semi-comatose, I had to have been radiating thaumic energy like mad.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her projection started to play a view of what had happened from her point of view.</p><p class="double">&quot;When I started to recover my senses, I got it back under control, but by then a group of military types had showed up, complete with a psychic, who immediately tried to mind control me. I chucked her out of my mind and pushed her away. I tried to communicate, tell them I didn&#039;t want to hurt anybody, just wanted help, but when I tried to cast a translation spell, they decided I was attacking and tried to blast me. </p><p class="double">&quot;I cast a sleep spell at the first one to do so, but then they all started, and while I was trying to block them, one must have used stealth technology to sneak up on me and use an electric stunner to knock me out. When I woke up, I was in a big glass chamber, with some sort of suppressive field making it hard to think. The invaders apparently use psychic powers too, and the scientists had some sort of suppressor. </p><p class="double">&quot;While the magic I use is different, it is related, and they were interfering with my powers. I resisted, they started trying to crush me to see how much power I could put out, and I refused to be crushed. No-pony really knows how the apotheosis works, but rarely, a regular pony at the very limits of their will and ability to survive can metamorphose into an alicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">She flexed her wings. &quot;As a unicorn I was in the top bracket of magic users in both power and versatility, both by talent and dedicated training and research. Alicorns are many times as powerful, and as a newly ascended one, my powers are still growing. The princesses Celestia and Luna are functionally immortal and can control the orbits of celestial bodies, and I&#039;m fairly sure by the time I get back I&#039;ll be able to pinch hit for them if they need a holiday.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyhow, I escaped, copied some memories from their chief scientist, something I&#039;m not proud of, but I desperately needed information about this place and she would presumably be the smartest one there. I found out among other things that she was ultimately going to do the same to me, though unlike my harmless spell, her methods involved driving metal probes into my brain and copying the electrical signals. The subject doesn&#039;t live long, and not with anything resembling a mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">She wrinkled her muzzle. </p><p class="double">&quot;Obviously, I got out of there, and had to decide what to do next. I&#039;ve already managed to send a message scroll back to Equus bare-horned, and will probably be able to follow it in a few days, though I may need to build a focussing array to get precision targeting. But I also found out what kind of stuff you guys had been through, and I wanted to help. But rather than just wandering around, randomly zapping things better, I decided to do it the hard way.</p><p class="double">&quot;The business I&#039;ve set up, Nightlight Industries gives me a legal identity, since as a non-human I&#039;m not covered by regular civil law, and I intend to use my powers within a framework of business to generate money for charitable purposes, and give a structured way to ask for my help directly. Which reminds me, half of the profit from this first sale of orbital salvage will be going to charity through the Nightlight Foundation. The rest will be invested in some other projects I thought up, which should ultimately create even more money for aid work.</p><p class="double">&quot;As well as that, I also have dozens of slightly used satellites and upper stages that could probably be reconditioned with a repair spell or some shop work. Their original owners get first refusal on my selling them at 100,000 pounds a pop, and as my advert stated, free delivery anywhere inside geostationary orbit. If the original owners don&#039;t want them, I&#039;ll put them up for general sale, I&#039;m sure I can get better than scrap metal values from a collector who wants their own satellite.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I also asked Princess Celestia not to send anyone after me, as I know you people are still leery of aliens. And that&#039;s the other reason I&#039;m doing this, to make it clear, not by fancy words but by deeds that my people are not like those monsters you&#039;ve been fighting. And that&#039;s all I have to say. Thank you for your time. In the manner of friendly aliens from your fictional works, live long and...&quot;</p><p class="double">She held up a hoof and then looked at it, frowning. &quot;Huh, didn&#039;t think that one through...&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a laugh from most of the people there. She gave them a grin and teleported away.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t until some time after that Joseph James found the business card for Nightlight Industries in his pocket with a written note about calling to set up a proper interview.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked into the bar with a haggard expression, giving Macintosh a brief nod as she slumped onto a stool. She stared at the mug he placed in front of her for a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I walked in on Spike and Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh blinked, pulled the mug away, and replaced it with something stronger.</p><p class="double">Twilight finally started drinking, staring into the distance. &quot;I mean... he&#039;s basically my <i>son.</i> How am I supposed to feel about this? I&#039;m happy for him and Rarity to be sure, but...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle walked into the bar, blushing furiously as she cast an age spell. Macintosh raised an eyebrow, placing a bit of watered down cider in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I walked in on Spike and Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh nodded, pushing the mug closer to the now technically adult mare.</p><p class="double">&quot;...It&#039;s weird, you know?&quot; Sweetie Belle sipped her drink. &quot;I mean... Sometimes, I wish I could &#039;wake up&#039; as a slightly older pony, but other times I get some sort of cootie fever...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis stepped into the bar, swishing her tail grumpily as she located a stool. She managed a brief, terse smile as Macintosh slid a glass of cider in front of her, before sighing.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I walked in on Spike and Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh raised an eyebrow, gesturing for her to go on.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t understand why they were so embarrassed,&quot; she continued, nursing her mug. &quot;I mean, I was only in there to grab a comb, and it was only sex...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cadance was positively giggling as she traipsed into the bar, humming brightly to herself. She grinned brightly at Macintosh as she took the glass of wine he held out, sipping it dramatically.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I walked in on Spike and Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh gave her a confused look.</p><p class="double">&quot;It is just so cute!&quot; she squealed, clapping her hooves together. &quot;I&#039;m so happy that they&#039;ve found each other. I mean, I had to give them a few tips, but honestly they were so enthusiastic...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A guitar exploded through the roof, standing up and strumming metal chords on itself as Discord moonwalked into the bar wearing thick sunglasses and a high-collar pink leather bomber jacket.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I walked in on Spike and Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh stared at him in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that it&#039;s actually important or anything. I just think people have been telling you that a lot. So what booze is available today, I loved that Bloodwine stuff...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.5 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">&quot;I AM TRIXIE! THE GREAT AND POWERFUL!&quot; the floating illusory unicorn head boomed at a volume rivaling the Royal Canterlot Voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yah know,&quot; deadpanned Applebloom, &quot;I don&#039;t know why any a&#039; us expected somepony different...&quot;</p><p class="double">It was a weird sort of fused Loop. To their knowledge, no current looper was from this Oz place, much like there was no looper from the Eiken universe, not to mention the fact that it usually wasn&#039;t populated with Equestrian races. Nyx had Awoken after her house crash-landed from being whisked away from some farm place called Kansas by a tornado. After a song and dance number from a town of bushwoolie things regarding the death of some &#039;wicked witch of the east&#039; she&#039;d collected Peewee – idly wondering if the phoenix was looping and how anyone would be able to tell if he was – as well as some ruby ponyshoes and set off down the yellow brick road to go see the Wizard.</p><p class="double">On the way she&#039;d come across the Awake versions of the CMC. Applebloom was some sort of pony-like scarecrow strung to a wood post, Sweetie was a tin mare who had rusted up in the woods, and Scootaloo was a griffin of all things. Nyx mused that the Loops had a strange sense of humour. The Loop memories of her three companions implied that her friends were seeking things they already possessed in spades. But they&#039;d all still agreed to come with Nyx to see the Wizard because, why not?</p><p class="double">&quot;I still say that gate guard sounded familiar,&quot; Sweetie cut in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you still on about that?&quot; Scootaloo groaned. &quot;Just because he&#039;s got a bit of a Trottingham accent doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s anyone we&#039;ve met before. You don&#039;t need to inspect everyone we come across to see if they&#039;re the Anchor you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOU DARE IGNORE TRIXIE, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL?!&quot; the floating head boomed again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nyx called back. &quot;How&#039;s the Loop treating you auntie?&quot;</p><p class="double">The head gave a big sigh before it dissipated along with the fog it was projected on. A curtain off to the side of the room was swept back and Trixie strode out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not bad,&quot; she replied reluctantly. &quot;But you four <i>could</i> show some respect for Trixie&#039;s showmare skills.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry,&quot; Applebloom apologized, &quot;but I noticed the projector lens when we came in and pointed it out to the others. It&#039;s still pretty dang impressive. Even if it&#039;s not quite what we&#039;d expect from you these days.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie&#039;s been rediscovering her roots this Loop,&quot; the showmare admitted. &quot;After a near disaster with an experiment, Trixie has been cutting back on the brute force she&#039;s come to rely on over the Loops and begin re-honing her skills at the stagecraft that once served her so well. In fact, Trixie has not used so much as a cantrip this Loop. And she has still convinced Oz and the threats to it that Trixie is a wizard of great skill and power. All through smoke and mirrors.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s pretty awesome!&quot; Scootaloo beamed. &quot;So, do you have a super-amazing quest for us to undertake?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed Trixie does,&quot; the showmare admitted. &quot;The Wicked Witch of the West is still at large and she is more powerful than her sister ever was. The task is to retrieve her ring, which possesses a gem through which she is able to focus her foul magics. Without it, she will be rendered powerless and of no more threat to Oz.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And after that?&quot; Nyx asked. &quot;I mean, it&#039;s not like any of us need the things we&#039;re supposed to want. Applebloom&#039;s got more brains than any of us, Sweetie&#039;s heart is as caring as ever, Scootaloo&#039;s still a daredevil, and I&#039;ve never technically <i>been</i> to the Kansas place I&#039;m supposed to be from this Loop so I&#039;ve got no real incentive to return. So I think we&#039;d probably just stick around for any more adventures you&#039;ve got on tap.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Trixie mused. &quot;There&#039;s the Nome King, Mombi, the Wicked Witch of the South is due to wake up from her enchanted sleep any time now, Princess Langwidere is out there somewhere collecting heads, Tyrone the Terrible is due to make a move soon, and there&#039;s probably a few others that escape Trixie&#039;s mind at the moment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is gonna be an awesome Loop!&quot; Scootaloo cheered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Picard the winkie dog, and normally one of the three Trek Anchors, stretched back in his guardpost. This was shaping up to be another nice vacation for him. His only interaction with other loopers had gone as usual, with them completely unsuspecting of his looping status. The Prime Directive probably wasn&#039;t meant to cover situations like this, but it had served him rather well in keeping his head down around other loopers. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.6&nbsp;&nbsp;(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight walked into the living room. &quot;Mom, Dad, I&#039;m stuck in a time loop that lasts a few years before rebooting, I&#039;ve had multiple lifetimes, I can transform into an alicorn at will, and I have an adopted daughter named Nyx who is technically Nightmare Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two unicorns gave her a long look.</p><p class="double">Then, finally, her mother spoke. &quot;Are you.... happy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... yeah, pretty much. I&#039;m not alone in the loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... alright then.&quot; The elder mare hugged her gently. &quot;We&#039;ll always love you, no matter how strange and incomprehensible you get.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion raised an eyebrow. &quot;Is Shining in this time loop too?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good,&quot; he said with finality. &quot;If you find any special somepony you should take them to him for approval.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Daaaaaaaaaaad!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.7 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as she Awoke, and blinked again as her Loop memories hit.</p><p class="double">Everyone she knew was still there. They were all the same colors, had the same talents, but this Loop instead of ponies, everyone was...</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, smurf,&quot; she muttered bitterly.</p><p class="double">Oh, great. It was affecting speech patterns too. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.8</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s been a while since I was last here,” Twilight said, adjusting her Robe And Wizard Hat. “Wonder if AJ&#039;s going to take the chance to go Paladin?”</p><p class="double">The inn door creaked open.</p><p class="double">“...huh.” Twilight looked the newcomer up and down. “Wasn&#039;t expecting you, to be honest...”</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged, the enormous sword hovering above her back riding silently up to stay at a set distance. “What can I say.”</p><p class="double">Twilight moved over. “Come on, sit down. We might be waiting a while. Oh, what class did you go with?”</p><p class="double">“Duskblade.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight frowned. “Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve heard of that one... it wasn&#039;t in that book Pinkie had, anyway.”</p><p class="double">Gilda settled into the chair. “So, what&#039;s this place like, anyway?”</p><p class="double">“Adventure with swords and sorcery, pretty much.” Twilight shrugged. “All six of us &#039;classic&#039; Element bearers had one a long while ago – that&#039;s where Fluttershy got started on her druid thing, though it took a while for her to really get used to using it again once the loop was over.”</p><p class="double">The gryphon nodded. “And any idea who else is here, then?”</p><p class="double">“Not really...” Twilight&#039;s eyes unfocused. “I picked up an Element of Honesty, of course, but that turned out to be yours... oh. Well, that should be interesting...”</p><p class="double">“What?”</p><p class="double">The door slammed open. “Tremble before the power of the Great and Powerful Trixie, Wilder extraordinaire!”</p><p class="double">A cough came from behind the blue unicorn.</p><p class="double">“And Chryssy, of course,” Trixie added, stepping aside to reveal the Changeling. “She&#039;s a psion.”</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. “Hi, guys. Come on, take a seat. I&#039;ll go get something alcoholic. Beer?”</p><p class="double">There were general nods.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, anyway, according to our backstories we met when she tried to use Charm on me and I tried to use a wild burst energy ray on her,” Trixie said with a grin. “Long story short, huge psionic glitch, both of us lost our powers for three days, actually got to know one another.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, sipping at her tankard. (Inns in Oerth always had quite good beer. It was the Profession system.)</p><p class="double">“So, are we heading out or what?” Gilda asked, idly casting Bloom on Trixie&#039;s beer and creating a miniature lily pad.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s other party members on the way, but last time there were six,” Twilight hedged. “I&#039;d say set off tomorrow morning.”</p><p class="double">The door creaked open again.</p><p class="double">“Or we could just have them turn up now,” Chrysalis observed, then winced. “Oh. Well, this could be awkward...”</p><p class="double">“Hi, Shiny, Cadence,” Twilight said, smiling. “How are you?”</p><p class="double">“Tolerable,” Shining replied, shaking water out of his mane. “It&#039;s raining out there, has been for two hours.”</p><p class="double">Cadence spread her wings and fluffed them out. “I miss weather schedules.”</p><p class="double">“So, er...” Chrysalis began, in a voice of forced calm.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry,” Cadence said, furling her wings again and looking Chrysalis in the eye. “Tell you what. Let&#039;s see this as a team building exercise. We can learn to be comfortable in one another’s presence.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t ask for miracles...” Chrysalis muttered.</p><p class="double">“Actually...” Cadence paused. “I suspect that I <i>could.</i> Eventually. Technically. Oh, I&#039;m a Favoured Soul and Shiny&#039;s a Paladin, just so you know.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight moved two more stools over. “That&#039;s us better off for healing than last time, anyway. Any idea what the Quest is?”</p><p class="double">A gnome walked up to Twilight, handed her a gilt envelope, and headed off for the back room.</p><p class="double">“Oh, thank you.” Twilight opened the envelope. “See, that&#039;s one nice thing about this world, it&#039;s so convenient for adventuring... aha!”</p><p class="double">She held up the letter within.</p><p class="double"><i>Dare YOU enter the OFFICIAL World&#039;s Largest Dungeon?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Every monster you&#039;ve ever heard of! (Non-core source books not included)</i></p><p class="double"><i>All the levels!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Caution: entering the dungeon does not allow one to exit from the dungeon. Bring food.</i></p><p class="double">“What do you think?” she asked.</p><p class="double">Gilda cracked her knuckles. “Sounds good to me!”</p><p class="double">Trixie gave Twilight a pitying look. “You even need to ask?”</p><p class="double">Cadence and Shining exchanged a look, then nodded.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Chrysalis sighed. “Well, all for one and one for all.”</p><p class="double">“Great!” Twilight took out a map. “It looks like it&#039;s a few hours&#039; journey from here.

I am irrationally angry at you right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Diamond rubbed the back of her neck and blushed. &quot;I... really am sorry for... whatever happened. Even though I don&#039;t remember it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus had the decency to look abashed, taking a longer, more calming breath. &quot;Okay, okay...

I... wow, just, I can&#039;t believe I was ever that....

Right, summer sun celebration, check the elements to see who&#039;s awake this loop – oh, Rarity wasn&#039;t awake, but the other bearers were. Well, that should be interest--</p><p class="double">There was a loud, angry thump on the front door. With a sigh, the pegasus walked downstairs and opened it, revealing a grumpy Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s that <i>time again.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash chuckled. &quot;Yeah, don&#039;t worry kid, I&#039;m looping.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good.&quot; The younger pegasus produced an all too familiar sheet of paperwork and trotted in, tossing the documentation on the table as she flomped onto the couch.</p><p class="double">With a sigh, the weathermare pulled out a pen and began going through the papers. &quot;Abusive parents <i>again?</i> Wow. Sorry, Scoots, I... I really don&#039;t think you deserve this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s like the loops can&#039;t make up their mind!&quot; Scootaloo sat up suddenly, throwing her hooves into the air. &quot;Half the time I have parents they&#039;re total deadbeats! Drunk or abusive or racist or... whatever. I can&#039;t even remember if I&#039;m supposed to be an orphan or not!&quot; She crossed her forelegs and glowered at the floor, idly pulling a necklace out of her subspace pocket and putting it on. &quot;...And none of the other crusaders are Awake, according to Pansy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh.&quot; Rainbow shook her head as she finished off the final bit of paperwork. &quot;Tell ya what, kiddo.

Her loop memories returned a moment later and she was conflicted. On the one hand, Nyx was here and replacing Trixie always made for an interesting loop. However, last loop had been a doozie and she could use a nice, relaxing vacation loop for once.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, Nyx was awake as well and didn&#039;t mind returning to Ponyville. She wanted to see all her friends and her family as well. Within moments, the two ponies and the cart disappeared from the road.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wow!&quot;</p><p class="double">That was all Twilight could say as she stepped into Big Mac&#039;s bar alongside Nyx. The place was packed with countless friends all talking up a storm. Berry just finished setting down a pair of &#039;honeymoon&#039; cocktails between Shining Armor and Cadance before returning to Mayor Mare, the newest equestrian looper. The crusaders sat at the Mayor&#039;s hooves as she gave the tale of latest fused loop in the DC Universe. Dash, Pinkie, Rarity, and Fluttershy were at their own table exchanging stories of their own. Applejack was nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sat with Luna and Celestia, clearly uncomfortable as she fidgeted while proposing ideas about a tea shop. The princesses, or at least Celestia, seemed delighted at the idea, which meant Chrysalis would be seeing more of her. Twilight knew it would be good for the nervous changeling, to get her out of her shell. Nyx scurried across the floor to the Crusaders as Twilight announced her arrival, &quot;Morning everypony!&quot;</p><p class="double">The bar responded with a resounding, &quot;Twilight!&quot; with the exception of Discord who shouted &quot;Norm!&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac slid a pint of cider to the edge of the redwood counter where Twilight usually came to a rest and asked, &quot;How&#039;s the loops treatin&#039; ya, Twiligh&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cantered over next to Mayor Mare, &quot;Vampires and Nazis Big Mac, enough said. Where&#039;s Applejack?&quot;</p><p class="double">The owner replied, &quot;Back a&#039; the farm preparin&#039; more cider. Everyone&#039;s awake this time. Dash got a letter from Gilda this mornin&#039;. Tiara&#039;s workin&#039; on a project back at &#039;er home. Trixie&#039;s busy with other duties, so she&#039;ll be in later. We even had a couple loopers from the multiverse in earlier.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to Big Mac and looked at the Mayor as she continued her tale. She slurped up the cider in one gulp and set it down as the Mayor got to the finale, &quot;And so after Apokolips invades and half of Metropolis is leveled, Superman punches Darkside through the other half! Literally, there wasn&#039;t a building left standing afterwords.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor looked to Twilight, &quot;How do you get used to such ruffians like the humans? They build such magnificent structures only for super powered monsters to tear them down like foals playing in the sand box.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a small grin, &quot;I found not all of them are so bad. Superman perfers to solve his problems without violence...it&#039;s just the others are not so willing. You sound like you could use a vacation, visit some family and old friends even if they&#039;re not awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor sighed, &quot;That does sound nice. But I have duties to Ponyville here-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight waved a hoof in a dismissing gesture, &quot;I could handle your Mayoral duties. I&#039;ve ran a country or two before after all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually,&quot; the mayor began, appearing not sure for a moment, &quot;I&#039;m not the Mayor this time around, I&#039;m the Librarian. Trixie is the mayor. I assume you&#039;ve replaced Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">The idea that Trixie replaced the Mayor sent a shiver of dread down her spine. Already, she could feel her quiet vacation loop disappearing like smoke in the wind. She listed and categorized several of the strongest alcohols out there before deciding on one and calling out for some of Jack Sparrow&#039;s rum stock he left behind before leaving Equestria, not even bothering to answer the former Mayor&#039;s question as her panic set in.</p><p class="double">But instead of a bottle of rum, a sparkling highball glass was set before her along with some gin. She looked up to see a human form Berry Punch standing in front of her giving her a smile that radiated calm, &quot;I&#039;d like you to try a human cocktail I was taught when I started perfecting my trade. If it doesn&#039;t fix your problems, I&#039;ll get that rum for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked the human Berry over for a moment, then remembered, &quot;You surprised me there, Berry. Forgot you can shift from pony to human form.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry&#039;s grin turned melancholy, &quot;The loop where I learned shape shifting was the same loop where I got my act together. It was a very strange loop, where no one was sent to the moon, you were replaced with Sunset Shimmer as the Summer Sun Celebration Co-ordinator, and a new bar named Eden Hall opened up where your treehouse library is.&quot;</p><p class="double">All activity in the bar ceased as the loopers turned to listen to Berry. The bartender didn&#039;t even notice as everypony was now listening, so lost in her thoughts and preparing the cocktail. She took a glass bottle labeled Angostura Aromatic Bitters and added it to the edge of the glass with four shakes.</p><p class="double">&quot;I believe the owner was your anchor replacement. He&#039;s actually quite the urban myth among loopers. Some call him the &#039;Phantom Looper&#039; since he tends to draw so little attention to himself that most loopers don&#039;t tend to realize he&#039;s looping. His local name was Shot Glass with the image of a golden cocktail being poured into a deep martini glass as his cutie mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry chuckled as she added the ice and a double measure of premium gin, &quot;I decided to sample its fine wares before its grand opening. As always, I broke into the building and made my way to the cellar. But when I got to the wine racks, there was nothing there. I searched for the better part of an hour in vain. I checked everything that could hold a bottle containing anything alcoholic. That was when Shot Glass found me.&quot;</p><p class="double">The cocktail was topped off with some tonic and the mixture was stirred slowly four times as it turned a pink hue, &quot;He found me trying to break into the only locked cabinet in the building, which only held some local equestrian seasonings. I saw him in human form and almost had a heart attack right there. That loop had a quirk where ponies could shift into human form, part of what terrified me so deeply. The other half was he could have called in the royal guard and had me exiled from town. Instead, the looper shifted into an earth pony with a black mane and tan coat. His eyes were full of kindness and a small amount of pity. An hour later, I&#039;m sitting at the bar as a human after being taught how to shift into human form with this cocktail resting on the countertop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bartender slid the stirring spoon out and added a lime wedge before shifting back to pony form and sliding the drink forward towards Twilight, &quot;Here you are, Twilight, the Pink Gin and Tonic, adding some herbs that I found mix well with this drink.&quot;</p><p class="double">The anchor took a sip of the drink and found the stress and pain from the last loop bleeding away with every drop that slid down her throat, &quot;Berry...this is amazing!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry rubbed at her snout in embarrassment at the praise. Twilight looked at the bartender, expecting Berry to finish her story. She caught on and continued, &quot;He started on about what type of Gin he used and the different citrus fruits one could add. But then he gave a small history about how the tonic had been used to treat Malaria in countries so far away they couldn&#039;t be found on the map. The word tonic means &#039;invigorating, refreshing.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry closed her eyes as if remembering an old friend, &quot;He served me countless cocktails from places that existed in legend with bottles that appeared from seemingly thin air. After all that, and when I couldn&#039;t pay him for all the drinks he gave me, I was offered a job as an assistant bartender. He took me under his wing and taught me how to pour and mix my own drinks. Turned out, I was good at the job, picking up the trade over the course of that loop. He learned that we were both loopers and introduced me to the multiverse. Bit by bit, he helped me clean up my life.&quot;</p><p class="double">After Twilight finished her Gin and Tonic, Berry cleaned out the glass, &quot;I hope to meet him again, show him how much I&#039;ve improved both as a mare and a bartender. So, Twilight, do you feel better? Do you still need that rum?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a pleasant smile, &quot;Actually no, I think I&#039;m good. I was hoping for a quiet loop, but an anchor&#039;s work is never done I guess. Mayor Mare, enjoy your vacation. You got yourself a replacement librarian.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a moment of peace as Pinkie bought a round for the whole place in celebration. But then like glass shattering, the peace was destroyed with the doors being flung wide open as Trixie flourished her purple cape, &quot;Rejoice, my fellow loopers, for it is I, the Great and Powerful Mayor Trixie, who has come to improve your lives!&quot;</p><p class="double">She went amongst all the loopers, handing them scrolls and coming to an end with Twilight and Mayor Mare. Already fearing the worst, she opened the scroll and frowned.</p><p class="double"><b>NOW ANNOUNCING THE FIRST ANNUAL EQUESTRIAN FOAM SWORD WAR!</b></p><p class="double"><b>The office of Mayor Trixie welcomes all who consider themselves loopers to Ponyville to participate in momentous occasion.

The former Mayor whispered in Twilight&#039;s ear in a begging tone, &quot;Please make sure some of Ponyville is standing when I get back.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight muttered under her breath, &quot;Tree damn it!&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">44.13</p><p class="double">Twilight trotted into Celestia&#039;s room.</p><p class="double">“Your Highness?”</p><p class="double">Celestia turned. “Ah, Twilight. I&#039;m sorry to have dismissed your concerns about Nightmare Moon in what may have seemed a cavalier manner-”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no, that&#039;s fine,” Twilight shrugged. “You want me to gather the Elements of Harmony, together with suitable bearers, so you have a backup plan if you can&#039;t talk Luna round when she gets back from the moon.”</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Sun blinked. “...yes, actually. How did you know?”</p><p class="double">Twilight sat down. “Time travel.”</p><p class="double">“You used a spell from the Star Swirl wing?”</p><p class="double">“No, not that time travel. A time loop – self contained temporal cyclicity, duration a little over five years.” Twilight grinned, summoned the Element of Magic, and Ascended in a flash of purple light.</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">“This isn&#039;t the first time. It isn&#039;t even the thousandth. I&#039;ve been going around in temporal circles for a <i>long</i> time. And I&#039;m not always the only one, either.”</p><p class="double">Twilight ruffled her wings. “Anyway. There&#039;s a reason I&#039;m telling you this. See, a couple of the other loopers want to partake of a certain ceremony, and to avoid anyone being left out of the first one they&#039;ve asked for it to be done when none but them and I are Awake. So... it might help to get you on side, to straighten a few issues out.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m still absorbing that you&#039;re an alicorn, Twilight,” Celestia said, strain in her voice. “Give me a minute or two.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Twilight replied readily.</p><p class="double">Celestia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and then made some tea. She heated the water the slow way, with a simmering heat spell, rather than simply flash-boiling it, and then poured two cups.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” she said, placing the cups on either side of a low table. “Let&#039;s start from the beginning. You are... time looping, you said?”</p><p class="double">“I did, and am.” Twilight took the proffered cup and sipped from it. “Ah, lovely. You <i>do</i> know how to brew a good cup... anyway. The first thing we need to do is to set up a party in Ponyville. I&#039;ve done it before, so I know how to set it up to handle Luna nice and amicably.”</p><p class="double">Celestia swallowed, shook her head, and took solace in some more tea.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, I&#039;m overwhelming you, aren&#039;t I?” Twilight shook her head. “I should really get better at breaking it to you when you&#039;re not Awake. Anyway, Spike and Rarity are both also looping this time, and they&#039;d like to tie the knot.”</p><p class="double">“...who is Rarity?” Celestia asked. “And – isn&#039;t Spike rather too young to be married?”</p><p class="double">“Time loops,” Twilight reminded her. “His mental age is on the far side of lots, and we worked out a way he can change his physical age at will. Rarity is a unicorn from Ponyville – the Element of Generosity.”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded.</p><p class="double">“The first time around, he got quite a bad crush on her. She might have reciprocated to some extent, she&#039;s not quite sure, but nothing happened within five years of today and so we never found out. When they met up in the Loops, both of them were quite a lot older and more experienced. They took over a hundred years – that&#039;s twenty iterations of the loop – to decide to become a proper couple, and they&#039;ve been significant others since then. It tallies up to...” Twilight paused. “Lots.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Celestia carefully considered the situation, and what Twilight had told her. “And they are happy together?”</p><p class="double">“Very.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, then.” Celestia nodded. “I&#039;m sure it will make sense once I meet her – and this new, older Spike. I assume you want me to attend the wedding?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “Spot on – though I&#039;d also appreciate your help handling the legal quagmire involved.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm, indeed...” As the shock faded, the Princess of the Sun began to apply her formidable mind to the problem. “Very well, I think it should be eminently achievable.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Princess.” Twilight turned to go.</p><p class="double">“Oh, Twilight?” Celestia said, warning in her tone. “Are you sure you want to go out into the corridor like that?”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked back, caught sight of her wings, and blushed before undoing the transformation.</p><p class="double">“That, more than anything, helps convince me of the truth of your words,” Celestia commented. “That you are so clearly comfortable in an alicorn&#039;s form.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn grinned. “Yeah, a lot of us have been able to do that for a while...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“She seems fine with it,” Twilight replied. “Right, who next?”</p><p class="double">Spike drummed his claws on the table. “Either your family – because I&#039;m sort of part of it – or Rarity&#039;s. Might be better to have Rarity for both those meetings.”</p><p class="double">Twilight lit her horn. “No time like the present. And I can drop off those party instructions with Pinkie on the way.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Rarity has become more dear to me than... anything else I possess,” Spike said solemnly.</p><p class="double">Magnum frowned. “Anything <i>else?</i>”</p><p class="double">“I am hers, as she is mine.” Spike shrugged, blushing a bit. “I... it&#039;s hard to explain, and it&#039;s kind of related to dragon psychology. We hoard things. Other dragons hoard gold, or gems, or artworks... I still have some of that, but the main thing I treat as a hoard is my friends. To me, Rarity is mine, and I would protect her to my last breath. And, at the same time, I am hers, and anything she desired, I would do.”</p><p class="double">“Does that include leaving?” Rarity&#039;s mother asked with a frown.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Spike said with a quick nod. “If she told me to go away and never come back... and if she <i>meant </i>it, and continued to mean it... I&#039;d stay out of her life. It would probably destroy me, but I would.”</p><p class="double">Pearl nodded slowly.</p><p class="double">“Can we speak to our daughter?” Magnum requested.</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Spike turned to go. “I&#039;ll let her know, and give you some privacy. Just ask when you want me back in.”</p><p class="double">“<i>If</i>, you mean,” Magnum said sternly.</p><p class="double">Spike nodded, and pushed the door open.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Does he make me happy?” Rarity repeated. “Yes. A thousand times yes.”</p><p class="double">She gave her parents a long, appraising look.</p><p class="double">“Let me put it this way. I know we mentioned the loops, and they&#039;re an easy concept to explain, but... they&#039;re nearly infinite in variety. I&#039;ve been worshipped as a goddess, I&#039;ve been a slave with not even my own cutie mark. I&#039;ve been the ruler of the world, I&#039;ve been a noble unicorn mare in my own right, I&#039;ve been a simple shop owner, I&#039;ve started my own business...” She shook her head. “It sometimes feels like I&#039;ve done everything, though the loops constantly show that I haven&#039;t. And if there&#039;s one constant I can truly rely on, it&#039;s that Spike cares for me.”</p><p class="double">“That kind of devotion...” Pearl winced. “It sounds... almost creepy.”</p><p class="double">“I do understand where you&#039;re coming from,” Rarity admitted. “It probably could look bad from that perspective. From the outside. But... well, we didn&#039;t exactly rush into it. It took us over a hundred years to go from friends to being an official couple, and that was... oh, so long ago. By now, he and I feel the same – neither of us started like this, but both of us developed it over time.”</p><p class="double">“And you trust him not to hurt you?”</p><p class="double">Rarity surprised all three of them by giggling. “Oh, sorry. But there&#039;s two things funny about that. The first is that, well, not to blow my own trumpet, but...”</p><p class="double">A soft white light flooded the room.</p><p class="double">“I can match him if I need to,” Rarity finished, extending her wings to their full span. “When we do spar – or have a spat – it&#039;s essentially a toss-up as to who wins. I&#039;m no damsel in distress, at least unless I want to be.”</p><p class="double">Magnum blinked a few times, then visibly got a grip on himself. “And second?”</p><p class="double">“Spike&#039;s a bearer of Loyalty,” Rarity replied matter-of-factly. “The short version is, that he bears Loyalty means that that trait, trustworthiness – dedication to his friends – is a fundamental part of his makeup.”</p><p class="double">Rarity fidgeted. “In all honesty, we don&#039;t need your blessing... after all, Spike and I are both adults by a long way. But it means a lot to me, and it would mean a lot to him. So – do we have your support?”</p><p class="double">Magnum and Pearl exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Is there anything which would make you leave Spike?” Pearl asked.</p><p class="double">“No,” Rarity replied. “Anything that would make me want to – he wouldn&#039;t be Spike any more. Not the one I love.”</p><p class="double">“Good answer,” Magnum commented.</p><p class="double">“Well, then... yes,” Pearl said softly. “We don&#039;t understand all of this, but what we do understand is all good.”</p><p class="double">Tears started in Rarity&#039;s eyes. “Thank you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Twilight asked, re-entering the main room of her parents&#039; house.</p><p class="double">Twilight Velvet nodded to her with a smile. “It&#039;s strange, because we still think of little Spykoran as, well, little, but if you and he agree that he&#039;s old enough... well, what else can we do?”</p><p class="double">Spike smiled.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that&#039;s good. I&#039;ll send you the invitations shortly. Is Shiny still living here?”</p><p class="double">“Well, he comes over often enough,” Night Light said. “A couple of times a week. He&#039;ll get them.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “Actually, I want to come over and give him the invitations for Cadence and him myself now. Just to see his face when he realizes that I know.”</p><p class="double">Velvet put her hoof over her smile. “Oh, dear, that <i>would</i> be funny. He still thinks he&#039;s managing to hide it, you know – says it&#039;s &#039;work-related&#039; reasons he&#039;s seeing her so often.”</p><p class="double">“So you know, actually,” Twilight said, reaching into her &#039;pocket and retrieving an album. “Here&#039;s some of their wedding pictures.”</p><p class="double">She paged through them, first the ones from their normal-loop weddings (both to plan and post-Changeling-battle) and then the increasingly exotic ones which were from especially noteworthy set-pieces for Loopers.</p><p class="double">“Are they always together?” Night Light asked, as his wife examined one of the photographs more closely.</p><p class="double">“Just about,” Twilight replied. “It doesn&#039;t happen every time, admittedly, there&#039;s been a few edge cases, but-”</p><p class="double">“Statistically insignificant,” her father filled in.</p><p class="double">“Yes.” She paused. “Cadence is one of the ponies I <i>really</i> trust, after so long in the loops. Don&#039;t worry, Shiny&#039;s in safe hooves.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t believe they all knew,” Shining Armour said ruefully.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s hardly the end of the world,” Cadence chided, smiling to remove the sting. “Besides, I think Twilight and Spike have an unfair advantage.”</p><p class="double">“Point,” Shining conceded. “Do you think-”</p><p class="double">Cadence overrode him. “Ssh! This is the good bit!”</p><p class="double">Words drifted over to them. “...in Eiken or in Hub...”</p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t know what that means,” Shining said, frowning. “I overheard Spike writing them, but...”</p><p class="double">“I assume it&#039;s part of that whole Loops thing, now shush!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike stared at the thin circlet of metal, still not quite believing it.</p><p class="double">Rarity tapped him on the shoulder. “Careful, or I&#039;ll start to get jealous of that ring.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you&#039;re what it symbolizes,” he replied, putting his arm around her. “I... it all seems like a dream, really.”</p><p class="double">Rarity glanced down at her dress. Like the rings, it was a simple one – her mothers&#039; dress, in fact.</p><p class="double">“I know what you mean,” she said, more quietly.</p><p class="double">They could both hear Sweetie Belle pestering Shining for a place in the Guard. Shining had tried to explain why she was a bit young, but Sweetie wasn&#039;t listening – and everypony else was finding it too funny to come to Shining&#039;s aid.</p><p class="double">“You are my wife,” Spike tried, the words feeling almost unreal.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re married,” Rarity ventured, finding the same thing happening.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Spike said, gamely, “at least we&#039;ll get a lot of time to practise saying them.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s very true.”</p><p class="double">They sat back, and watched Luna&#039;s moon rise through the trees.</p><p class="double">“...you realize,” Rarity said, in a much less serious voice, “that I am no country bumpkin to be won over by so paltry a display.” She winked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, indeed, my fair lady,” Spike countered, then dropped the act. “I&#039;ve been planning the <i>big</i> one for a while. Still not finished yet.”</p><p class="double">“I can wait,” Rarity promised. “As long as it takes.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">44.14 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There was a flare of pink fire as the boutique door slammed open. &quot;RARITY BELLE PLATINUM PRINCESS WHATEVER OTHER NAMES YOU&#039;VE HAD!&quot;</p><p class="double">The white unicorn looked up from the dress she was sewing and raised an eyebrow. &quot;You know, the full name ultimatum doesn&#039;t actually work in the loops, does it? I suppose for humans it&#039;s generally easier but--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;DON&#039;T CHANGE THE SUBJECT!&quot; In stormed a pink alicorn, mane shifting and swirling angrily as she glared down at the traitor before her. &quot;YOU! HAD A WEDDING! <b>WITHOUT ME!!!!!!!</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity took a moment to still her terrified heart.</p><p class="double">Then she took a breath and let it out. &quot;I take it you&#039;ve seen Twilight&#039;s film of the ceremony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes. It was very beautiful, quite sincere. I really wish I could have been there.&quot; Cadence blinked and shook her head, remembering her wrath. &quot;WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO MY ORIGINAL POINT--!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re still planning on doing the big wedding!&quot; the unicorn reassured her quickly. &quot;We just wanted everyone to be Awake first!&quot; She wasn&#039;t sure if that was true or not but she figured it would buy her time.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You had BETTER,&quot; Cadence growled, &quot;be sure about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Absolutely.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a tense moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;...are... you not going to yell at Spike?&quot; Rarity finally ventured.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, he lives with Twilight,&quot; the princess replied with a dangerous grin. &quot;I&#039;ve already expressed my displeasure with him.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

It is wonderful to see you all again!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And finally, an unexpected challenger. Somepony that will most definitely surprise you... because she isn&#039;t really a pony. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you CHRYSALIS, QUEEN OF CHANGELINGS!&quot;</p><p class="double">Columns of green flames burst around the arena as a tall form flew from the shadows, landing between the two surprised competitor teams. &quot;Well, well, well. It&#039;s good to see you all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait a minute, this is a partner sport!&quot; Spike pointed out. &quot;Who are you going to–oh. Oh no.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;OH YES! Chrysalis&#039;s partner is none other.... THAN MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&quot; A blue unicorn leapt out of the announcer&#039;s box. &quot;GIVE IT UP FOR.... THE GREAT! AND POWERFUL! TRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIXIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Wait a minute,</i> Cookie said suddenly. <i>You all still remember Old Holly Hooves?</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle, and Apple Bloom shared a look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... well... he&#039;s kinda a story.&quot; The earth pony chuckled awkwardly. &quot;Fer little fillies and colts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A big jolly reindeer comes down the chimney and sticks gifts in stockings,&quot; Sweetie Belle explained. &quot;I personally thought it was an adorable old pony&#039;s tale, but–&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Old pony&#039;s tale?!</i> Pansy cried in shock. <i>That caribou was one of the bravest heroes of our generation!</i></p><p class="double">Clover sighed. <i>Pansy, dear, our own story was sanitized over the generations. As great as Holly was, the fact is Krampus could give nightmares to foals.</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo raised an eyebrow. &quot;Krampus? I don&#039;t think I know that name...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>And there you have it,</i> Smart Cookie said wearily. <i>Without the villain, Holly becomes nothing more then a nice gift giver...</i></p><p class="double">Apple Bloom smiled to herself. &quot;Maybe ya&#039;ll could set the record straight then. Who was Krampus, and how was Old Holly Hooves a hero?&quot;</p><p class="double">For a moment, the necklaces were silent.</p><p class="double"><i>You have to understand,</i> Clover began slowly, <i>the Fire of Friendship only worked in a localized area. Even while we were expanding Equestria, a lot of the land was still covered in ice and snow.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Still, there were a lot of opportunistic groups out there,</i> Smart Cookie continued. <i>They&#039;d set off, a union of the three tribes, and found settlements in hopes of repelling the Windigos. Sometimes it worked... sometimes it didn&#039;t.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Some of my own kin were part of one of those groups,</i> Pansy commented. <i>They bravely went back north, not to the old lands, but... well, they built themselves a little village. It was a fairly normal settlement, we&#039;d get reports back, but then one month... nothing.</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo patted her necklace gently. &quot;It must have been hard, not knowing what happened...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I assumed they&#039;d been buried in the snow.</i> Pansy sighed. <i>There was a country to run, and I couldn&#039;t afford to go looking for them....</i></p><p class="double"><i>Nopony blames you,</i> Smart Cookie offered gently. <i>We couldn&#039;t have known about him.</i></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle gulped. &quot;About... who, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Krampus the Black.</i> Without warning, Clover projected a holographic image of a horned, shaggy–furred biped, whip in hand and red eyes glaring. <i>A satyr sorcerer who enslaved the village. The manacles he wore granted him power so long as weariness and despair were abundant. But with the windigos retreating...</i> She trailed off.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom&#039;s eyes widened. &quot;He needed to find a new source of suffering ta power his magic.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>And here was this village of ponies, right on his doorstep...</i> The necklace around Bloom&#039;s neck glowed angrily. <i>Krampus was a monster, in form and in heart. He would break the legs of ponies who defied him, and whip those he considered too slow in their so called work. Mare, stallion, foal.... pegasus, unicorn, earth pony.... he treated all with equal cruelty, making them labour in the snow whenever suited him. They took to sticking warm coals in their stockings just to fight off the cold.</i></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle stared at the image before her. &quot;...I take it this is where Old Holly Hooves comes in?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Indeed.</i> With a slight shift, the necklace around Belle&#039;s neck changed the image to a noble, elderly caribou with a thick white beard and piercing eyes. <i>The caribou clan has always had a connection with wind, being able to hear the whispers from miles away. Their elders have even managed flight, sometimes. And when Holly Hooves heard the cries of pain and anguish on the winds, he was so moved he had to act.</i></p><p class="double">Scootaloo was now completely enraptured by the story. &quot;So... what did he do?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>He did what I would have done,</i> Pansy replied gravely. <i>He provided for those under his protection, by having his tribemates sequester gifts of food and clothing in secret to the village, and sought out a way to defeat Krampus, by tracking down the beings who made his manacles in the first place.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Mountain elves,</i> Clover elaborated. <i>Very rare, very isolated. Presumably there was some sort of war that nearly wiped them out... whatever the case, Holly found them, asked for their help. They forged him a chain of bells that would neutralize elvish magic, but only if it was fuelled by hope and joy. And in return he swore his clan to their protection.</i></p><p class="double">Smart Cookie glowed with pride <i>They say the battle lasted a full day. Even after the chains were fuelled by the hope of the village, Krampus and Holly duelled in a blistering snowstorm. I don&#039;t know how much of that was exaggerated, but in the end Old Holly Hooves won. There was a great celebration in the village, the ponies made robes for the elves, bread was broken with the caribou... a message was sent out to us, detailing the whole thing, but by the time we arrived they had all gone.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Wow.&quot; Apple Bloom breathed out. &quot;Ah... did not even realize...&quot; She looked at the painting of a smiling reindeer with new eyes. &quot;And that&#039;s tha last ya&#039;ll heard of them?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>...I did meet him much later,</i> Pansy admitted. <i>When I was very old. Travelling north, I saw a glacier in the shape of a caribou skull... and inside, a coven of elves making toys, with the old deer himself at their head. He explained that the bells which bound Krampus would need to be... well, refuelled soon, so he&#039;d come up with an idea to spread gifts to the little ones in a nearby village. I advised him to do so around Hearth&#039;s Warming Eve, so as to capitalize on the emotion... I suppose that&#039;s how the story was revitalized.</i></p><p class="double">After a moment, the necklace sighed. <i>I don&#039;t understand how the chimney thing came about, though.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.3 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight honestly wondered why variant Loops set in the Canterlot High School universe – that strange alternate version of Equestria where everypony she knew had a human counterpart – weren&#039;t more common. She&#039;d certainly prefer this place to that alternate Ponyville where &#039;Rainbow Dash always dresses in style&#039;.</p><p class="double">The good news for this Loop was that finally, finally, the other Elements were Awake for it. She could now actually explore this place with her friends rather than startlingly accurate facsimiles.</p><p class="double">The bad news started when the zombies showed up.</p><p class="double">Not just normal zombies, but the ones with ridiculous variations like wearing road cones and buckets on their heads, pole vaulters, bob–sleighers, and other types she&#039;d have rather never seen again.</p><p class="double">And the only viable long–term defense were those cartoony animate plants. She may have had access to world–shaking magic and weapons, but even her reserves weren&#039;t nearly as inexhaustible as the zombies seemed to be.</p><p class="double">It was another fused Loop with <i>that</i> universe. And no forewarning to check her sanity at the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what&#039;s the deal with Crazy Dave anyway? Is he the Anchor from wherever these things are normally from?&quot; Rainbow asked her after a particularly brutal wave. Thankfully, no brains had been eaten yet. At least not those of anypony&#039;s counterpart she knew. The attacks let up often enough that basic necessities like food and utilities could be gathered before hunkering back down and waiting for the next attack. She and her friends had taken to sleeping in shifts so that there was always at least two of them awake in case &#039;extreme gardening&#039; skills were needed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe,&quot; Twilight responded tiredly. &quot;No one can really tell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Think we could ask Sleipnir to check the next time we see him?&quot; Rainbow suggested.</p><p class="double">&quot;Already did that,&quot; Twilight told her friend. &quot;Apparently he is the designated Anchor for his universe, but his &#039;code&#039; is so incomprehensible that even the Yggdrasil admins can&#039;t tell if he&#039;s actually looping or if his universe stabilized on its own. And they don&#039;t want to try triggering others from his universe to start looping until they figure it out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot; Rainbow scrunched her face in confusion. &quot;How can the beings that run reality not understand him enough to tell if he&#039;s looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave Rainbow Dash a flat stare. &quot;Because he&#039;s crazy.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the dank gloom of the Everfree forest, a predator moved on silent feet.</p><p class="double">Moving lightly over the leaf litter, the predator&#039;s eyes flickered all around. Her nostrils scented the air, trying to gain the slimmest edge.</p><p class="double">There!</p><p class="double">The predator bounded forwards, pushing off with all her might and soaring over a brook towards her goal.</p><p class="double">There were several seconds of snarling, growling tussle, and then predator and target separated. Both were bleeding, but the cuts were superficial, and they darted off into the undergrowth once more.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How long are they going to take?” Spike asked, hovering on a thermal. “It&#039;s been five hours!”</p><p class="double">“No idea.” Twilight trimmed her wings to catch the same thermal, and then soared up and around her assistant. “Suppose they&#039;ll just have to work it out for themselves.”</p><p class="double">She rolled onto her back, grinning. “Ah, I&#039;m not a pegasus nearly enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A heavy paw slammed Gilda&#039;s beak into the ground, making her see stars. Snapping out her wings, she forced the other off her and lashed backwards with her hind–paws hoping to catch her target with them.</p><p class="double">No such luck.</p><p class="double">The only warning she got, as she righted herself and made to turn, was a moment&#039;s rustling leaves. Then a weight landed on her back, forcing her back to the forest floor.</p><p class="double">White teeth flashed near her throat for a second, and she went limp.</p><p class="double">“Okay, okay,” she said after a moment. “You win. Seventeen to fourteen.”</p><p class="double">The wolf closed her jaws, and carefully backed off Gilda&#039;s side. Then it blurred, and Fluttershy stood there.</p><p class="double">“Thank you for your understanding.”</p><p class="double">“Understanding, hash!” Gilda pawed at her beak to get some of the mud off. “Pwah. Anyway, take it from one predator to another – I get the whole dominance issues thing. It&#039;s better we get it out of the way now.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, her cheeks slightly coloured.</p><p class="double">“...I&#039;ll win next time, though.”</p><p class="double">The pale yellow pegasus gave Gilda a look which was surprisingly arch.</p><p class="double">“...maybe. Okay, we&#039;ve had the fight, what now?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Fluttershy shuffled her paws. “I did get hold of some rather nice hadrosaur meat last loop there was a chance...”</p><p class="double">“Dinosaur meat?” Gilda&#039;s eyes lit up. “I am <i>so</i> there!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There we go,” Twilight said, nodding with satisfaction. “That&#039;s that.”</p><p class="double">“I heard something about dinosaur meat...” Spike trailed off. “Any chance I could get some with gemstones roasted in?”</p><p class="double">“I think you&#039;ll have to ask Fluttershy.” Twilight waggled her wings. “I&#039;m not willing to speak for her.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” He made a ponderous turn towards Ponyville, with Twilight accelerating to ride his slipstream. “...any chance you could get me something from the next time you encounter a silicon based creature?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll think about it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.5 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p></p><br /><p><p class="double">Shining woke to the gentle rocking of the ocean.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m in a boat, and it&#039;s night...” Specifically, a small ship with one mast, that seemed to have seen more than its fair share of years. </p><p class="double">“And I&#039;m wearing a mask, and have a rapier by my side.” Then his loop memories set in. </p><p class="double">“Cadence&#039;s in danger!” Looking ahead, he could see another small ship ahead of him, in the distance, and yes, searching his memories, they were heading to the &#039;Cliffs of Insanity&#039;.</p><p class="double">“Who names these places?” he snorted with disdain.</p><p class="double">He considered jumping from the boat and swimming the remaining distance, but loop memories kicked in again.</p><p class="double">“Right, eels.”</p><p class="double">The dawn was ascending and the ship up ahead had docked at the cliffs. Arriving, himself, all he found was a length of rope that went straight up the cliff. Looking at his hooves, and looking at the rope...</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve got to be kidding me.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken a few moments, but he&#039;d heard about gravity shifting spells from his sister and this was as good a time as any to try them out. </p><p class="double">It was now the reason he was galloping up the cliff&#039;s face, where ironically, upon reaching the top, he now stood face to face with that very same sister.</p><p class="double">“Hey BBBFF!”</p><p class="double">“Twily?” he asked, shocked.</p><p class="double">“Well, here it&#039;s Twilingo Montoya, dashing and revenge driven swordsmare.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, wait. Are we in &#039;the Princess Bride&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“Ahuh. You&#039;re the Stallion in Black, the Dread Pirate Blackmask.”</p><p class="double">“I knew this somehow seemed familiar. The Cliffs of Insanity should&#039;ve given it away.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway, there&#039;s Big Mac and Spike ahead of us as Mazzik and Spikini. Cadence&#039;s awake, but those two aren&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">“Great! I&#039;ll see you later...” moving to leave, he was pulled back by a purple, tekekinetic tug.</p><p class="double">Twilight nervously hooved the ground. “Shiny, I was kinda wondering if we could duel.”</p><p class="double">“What? Now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes grew big. “Please?!”</p><p class="double">Shining sighed. “Fine.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A thrown rock smashed close to him. He&#039;d been running in pursuit of Cadence and the remaining two, finally ending in a rocky gorge.</p><p class="double">“Enope.”</p><p class="double">Big Mac, or Mazzik as he was known here, trotted out from behind a rock. It was sight he&#039;d remember for a very long time as you don&#039;t often see Mac dressed in a turban and vest.</p><p class="double">Doing his best to stifle any laughter, he replied. “Now what?”</p><p class="double">“You put down your sword and magic, I put down my rock, we settle this like civilized folks. Hoof to hoof. Sportspony–like.”</p><p class="double">“Ah hah. Sportspony–like.” Shining chuckled nervously.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Mac went down with a large thud, unconscious.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, about that. Oh right. What was the line? &#039;Dream about large mares?&#039;&#039;</p><p class="double">Shining grabbed his sword in his telekinesis and raced after Spikini and Cadence.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Shining was seated across from Spikini and a blindfolded Cadence out in an open field. Two glasses of wine sat on a stump in front of him.</p><p class="double">&#039;Awake or not, I don&#039;t actually want to kill Spike.&#039; thought Shining.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twenty minutes earlier.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shiny, Thanks for the duel,&quot; said a lightly panting Twilight. &quot;One more thing. Awake or not. Please don&#039;t kill Spike.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;d you have in mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! I know!&quot; Twilight reached into her subspace pocket, and pulled out a vial. </p><p class="double">&quot;This is a sleeping dust. Its odorless, but works when you inhale it, so don&#039;t do that. You should be able to figure out the rest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, Twily!&quot; Shining cried as he dashed off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Back to the present. </p><p class="double">Shining reached into saddlebags and removed the vial Twilight gave him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Inhale this but do not touch.&quot; cautioned Shining.</p><p class="double">&quot;I smell nothing.&quot; replied Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;What you do not smell is called iocane powder. Its odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is one of the more deadly poisons know to equines.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm..&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining than took the cups and placed them behind him for a few moments and before bringing them back and placing them on the stump.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun. Its ends when you decide and we both drink and find out who is right, and who is dead.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spikini?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spikini?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spikini responded by falling over, asleep.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Wasn&#039;t sure it&#039;d work that fast.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Snnxxz...&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining removed Cadence&#039; blindfold.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. Iocane doesn&#039;t work like that.&quot; questioned Cadence.</p><p class="double">&quot;Swapped the iocane for some sleeping dust. Started working when I asked him to inhale it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence replied with a flat &quot;Huh.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Snnzxzz&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You said it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So how do you want to play the rest of it?</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we&#039;re definitely not playing it straight. I&#039;ve not terribly fond of being tortured and having fifty years of my life sucked away&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not to mention the whole &#039;Mostly dead&#039;, thing.&#039;&quot; Cadence added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, but I do have a plan.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A slightly worse for wear Shining and Cadence emerged from the exit of the Fire Swamp, and Prince Blueblood, Count Sombra and a half dozen guards were there waiting for him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Surrender!&quot; The Prince barked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.&quot; Shining snarked back.</p><p class="double">&quot;I give you full marks for bravery. Don&#039;t make yourself a fool.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, but how will you capture us, especially when we have this!&quot; A pink energy shield surrounded both Shining and Cadence, forming a ball.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh very good. But we can wait around.&quot; Sombra replied, amused.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m counting on that!&quot; said Shining as he and Cadence started running with the energy shield they were in rolling forward like some bizarre hamster ball.</p><p class="double">There were gasps of shock and surprise as everypony madly ducked out of the way as it went hurling through.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah! You missed!&quot; Blueblood&#039;s joy turned to sorrow as he saw the ball turn around and come racing back after him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh crud.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Somehow, in all the chaos, Twilight had shown up, and was busy stunning the guards and anypony else that was left standing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twily?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think I&#039;d miss this? I followed you all the way here. Oh and I needed to do one more thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">She walked over to Count Sombra and knelt over by his face. Curious, Shining and Cadence walked over as well.</p><p class="double">&quot;You made his face look like a Kabuki mask?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup. It&#039;s permanent too. Had to get my revenge somehow. &quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is a <i>sanctuary</i> loop. There&#039;s no violence, no hate...&quot; She glowered at the green unicorn across from her. &quot;We&#039;re here to help people recover from the stresses of their home loop. We are not here to play yes–men and coddle morons.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blond colt looked right back at her. &quot;What are you saying, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m saying that showing off is fine. You can wow the crowd with your magic, that&#039;s great. But lecturing them on your superiority? <i>Casting Imperio?</i>&quot; She leaned over the desk. &quot;The only reason you&#039;re not on the moon right now is because I&#039;ve BEEN to Hogwarts. I know exactly how your world runs. I knew what kind of environment you grew up in, and I know what is expected of you. Quite frankly, I pity you.&quot;</p><p class="double">A sneer formed on the green unicorn&#039;s face–</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot; Twilight cut him off. &quot;I took the Dark Lord on by myself and utterly destroyed him in my <i>first</i> fused loop. Nothing you can say will impress or terrify me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....Hrm.&quot; The sneer was gone, replaced by a carefully neutral expression. &quot;The star bear wasn&#039;t my fault.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Ura Minor is a standard whenever Trixie comes around,&quot; Twilight countered dismissively. &quot;We&#039;re not blaming you for that. But not even Trixie went into &#039;dark&#039; magic without being influenced by the Alicorn Amulet. You&#039;ve crossed a line.&quot; She smiled, a smile more suited to a carnivore. &quot;So.... you&#039;re going to have some <i>remedial</i> lessons. Every bearer is going to teach you how to embody their element.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn groaned. &quot;And here I finally thought I&#039;d be able to get out of school... I take it you&#039;ll be enforcing these lesson plans somehow?&quot;</p><p class="double">With a smile, Twilight handed him a series of parchments. &quot;Here. Letters from Pinkie when she replaced Hermione Granger.&quot;</p><p class="double">She would later privately admit that the reaction of the colt in front of her was one of the most hilarious things she had ever seen.</p><p class="double">&quot;....I.... see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It gets better,&quot; she quipped. &quot;She can become an alicorn at will.&quot;</p><p class="double">The green unicorn grew a little greener.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, recap: You&#039;re going to publicly apologize to Ponyville, me and my friends are going to give you lessons on the Elements of Harmony, and we&#039;ll see how this goes.&quot; Twilight Sparkle smiled brightly. &quot;Welcome to Equestria, Draco Malfoy.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.7 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and the triple somersault by that unicorn was absolutely incredible! I&#039;ll admit I was a little worried when the earth pony filly, Apple something, jumped from that pier but the way that the pegasus caught her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And those BATONS! I don&#039;t know how they enchanted them! Even if they got outside help, the amount of things that they turned into – and the flute solo was amazing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t even believe the, what did they call them, extreme gear? Extreme indeed! I&#039;ve never seen anything like it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That finale, though, that was absolutely astounding. Obviously they couldn&#039;t have really ascended, that would be impossible, but it seemed so real!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Harshwhinny? Didn&#039;t you say something about me needing to contain my enthusiasm?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.8 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...This is... awkward,&quot; Smart Cookie finally said, glancing down at the necklace around her neck.</p><p class="double"><i>Well... in retrospect, it was inevitable. Ah mean, we&#039;re soulbounded. Lotta loops where that&#039;s normal have a few switches.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, but...&quot; The filly rubbed the back of her head awkwardly. &quot;It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve had an actual body. And such a young one at that, I... honestly don&#039;t know what to do.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Enjoy being a foal! Go to school, look fer yer cutie mark, make friends with Pansy and Clover... Get covered in tree sap, Ah dunno. Go on, ya&#039;ll deserve it.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.9 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Doctor, it&#039;s been...<i>really interesting</i> travelling with you,&quot; Twilight Jane Smith said.</p><p class="double">This was her very first fused loop with this new universe, and it had been a challenge. There was time travel going on EVERYWHERE! A whole race of beings who worked the fabric of time and space the way pegasus ponies handled the weather! The fact that ponies and humans coexisted on Earth was the least strange thing, but at least Twilight could run comfortably. Travel with the Doctor seemed to require lots of running.</p><p class="double">The whole universe had a weird vibe to it, though. Twilight had decided to hold off on experimenting with anything until she had a better idea of what was going on, sticking to her loop–self&#039;s role. Even THAT had been confusing! But now, after many adventures and four (no, wait, seven? Maybe?) Doctors, the loop was about to end.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; the Doctor said, hands rubbing together, &quot;Now then, before you go popping off to that little pony universe of yours, there&#039;s one thing I <i>probably</i> should mention.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike opened his mouth to ask Twilight what the plan was for this loop, only to close it again as she walked in with a pronounced eye twitch.</p><p class="double">&quot;I – that – UGH!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bad loop?&quot; Spike asked instead.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes – no, not really, the loop wasn&#039;t that bad,&quot; Twilight admitted, &quot;But that Doctor! He figured out I was looping, and I thought HE was too. Only he ISN&#039;T, he just time travels so much that he was able to bluff it out. And he didn&#039;t bother saying anything about it until end of the loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">Grumbling, Twilight reached into her subspace pocket. At least she&#039;d managed to keep the sonic lipstick, she&#039;d finally be able to figure out the full range of that thing&#039;s abilities...except that the sonic lipstick was gone, having been replaced with a notice.</p><p class="double">&quot;The universe you are attempting to breach is locked as READ–ONLY. No items or persons may be copied, on pain of...&quot; Twilight skimmed past several dozen threats from Skuld. The general theme was, on pain of <i>pain.</i> &quot;...huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">Great. So much for all the useful things Twilight had planned to nab from the TARDIS next time she looped in there. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Ah, that fresh new world smell!</p><p class="double">Jenny took a deep breath as she flickered into existence, sighing and smiling. Grass, live grass. Cobblestones. Hay. <i>Magic,</i> infusing everything. Pastoral, then?</p><p class="double">Her eyes flickered open, looking around at the small village. The creatures that lived here were slightly–only slightly–shorter then humans, judging from the doors. There were pink highlights in every building, enough to be noticed, but not enough to be... <i>gaudy.</i> Many of the doors lacked knobs, or handles, and as one of the natives wandered into her vision, tossing her curly pink mane, she realized why. Ponies! Every little girl&#039;s dream, in all the colors of the rainbow!</p><p class="double">Her eyes widened as a winged pony landed next to the pink one and chatted for a moment. She hadn&#039;t meant the rainbow comment literally, but apparently...</p><p class="double">The pony pegasus (could it really be a pegasus if it wasn&#039;t a horse?) took off again, and Jenny followed its path with her eyes. Once more she was in awe as the pony handled the clouds in the sky. Weather manipulation was old hat to her, of course, but the way that this pony twisted and turned through the air made it clear that she was a natural at her given task. Quickly pulling a camera out of her satchel, Jenny started to film what she could of the aerial display–</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there!&quot;</p><p class="double">The woman whirled and looked into the widest smile she had seen in a long time. How had the pink pony managed to sneak up on her? After a moment, realizing that no attack was forthcoming, Jenny smiled and rolled her eyes. &quot;Hello here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Ha! Good one!&quot; The pink pony stuck out a hoof. &quot;I&#039;m Pinkimena Diane Pie, local party pony and friend to loopers everywhere! Don&#039;t worry, the Anchor&#039;s going to be here this afternoon, I&#039;ll introduce you. Welcome to Equestria!&quot;</p><p class="double">Jenny grinned and took the hoof in her hand. &quot;Jenny Everywhere, shifter and drifter. Your loop&#039;s pretty nice! You got humans here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not native.&quot; Pinkie tilted her head. &quot;Actually, most other loopers that come here turn into ponies. What&#039;s up with you?&quot;</p><p class="double">The woman sighed, looking off into the distance. &quot;I&#039;m... a bit of an anomaly. I don&#039;t actually have a home loop... as far as I can tell, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my gosh! That&#039;s... sad, but it sounds exciting!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heck yeah!&quot; Jenny smirked at the pony. &quot;I get to go everywhere! Krogan, elves, vampires, ninjas, ninja elf krogan vampires–that was one WEIRD loop–I ain&#039;t seen it all, and I never will, but that won&#039;t stop me from trying!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.11 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was running over her options at the moment. The expansions seemed to be proceeding apace and the prospect of new experiences – particularly finally learning what might be in that locked object the Tree of Harmony had produced – was quite invigorating to her. In addition, last Loop she&#039;d finally completed her little set of variants of the latest Daring Do novel, each one guest starring a different friend of hers (plus one guest starring her of course), and was looking forward to the next Loop they were all together so she could give them out.</p><p class="double">Right now though, she was wondering if there was any method she hadn&#039;t yet used to deal with Sombra. While the evil stallion usually had all the mental acuity of an unrepentant drug addict who snorted crystals – the Elements of Harmony apparently did a number on his mind most Loops – he was an extremely evil and scary pony the Loops where he was competent. As such, Twilight felt little remorse for humiliating him in new and creative ways every chance she could get. Frankly, he deserved it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm... maybe I can arrange an &#039;accidental&#039; meeting with Daring this Loop and get her on board with discovering an intact lost civilization, recovering a powerful magical artifact, and defeating a despotic conqueror all at the same time. Could make for an interesting book. I wonder if I still have that–&quot;</p><p class="double"><u><i><b>*CRACK*</b></i></u></p><p class="double">45.12 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;–harglepth...&quot; Twilight collapsed to the ground. She tried looking around her, but immediately closed closed her eyes when her vision swam rather severely. She <i>thought</i> she was back in her tower in Canterlot where she did research as Celestia&#039;s student prior to being sent to Ponyville, but that made no sense. She&#039;d been in the middle of a typical, if lonely, Loop and abruptly she was here. There was no reason she could tell for the Loop to have ended prematurely like that, but she felt like she&#039;d just Awoken. And in the roughest manner she&#039;d ever experienced.</p><p class="double">In all honesty, she felt sick enough to have consumed the entire contents of Big Mac&#039;s looping stock of alcohol as well as suffering the combined hangover that would induce at the same time. Frankly, if she hadn&#039;t garnered the mental fortitude looping inevitably provided, the pounding of her head would probably be lethal all by itself.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked the air around her. Or tried to. It came out more like &quot;whppnd&quot;. She thought she heard voices, but the pounding in her head drowned them out.</p><p class="double">Twilight wasn&#039;t certain how long it was before her head started to clear – the pain and disorientation rather made it hard to keep track of time – but clear it did. She opened her eyes to see the concerned faces of not only Celestia and Spike, but also the other five normal Elements, Gilda, Trixie, as well as Luna and her daughter Nyx to boot. And to top it all off, Sleipnir, the eight–legged Yggdrasil admin assigned to their universe.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow,&quot; she chuckled weakly. &quot;How hard did my collapse derail the timeline?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s okay!&quot; Pinkie cheered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my, Twilight,&quot; Rarity gushed, &quot;You gave us all quite the scare.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No kiddin&#039; sugarcube,&quot; Applejack breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Y&#039;all been out fer hours.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever happened to you reverberated through the Elements so hard that everyone bonded to one felt it like a physical blow,&quot; Rainbow told her, looking more worried than Twilight had ever seen her. &quot;Even Gilda felt something was wrong and she&#039;s the most recent addition to the club.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mine sister sent out the signal that she was awake and we responded promptly. Celly told us of your predicament and together we arranged for both ourself and Nyx to be brought down early to render any aid we could. We... are not certain precisely why the eight–legged Lokison has come.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I needed to be certain that Twilight was stable,&quot; the Yggdrasil admin said rather formally. &quot;She was hit rather hard with a destabilizing event and I needed to be on hand in case she required my aid recovering from this end. I am thankful that no intervention was required. You may rest easy, her regaining consciousness means any potential danger has passed.&quot;</p><p class="double">One by one, each of the visitors expressed their relief that Twilight was alright.</p><p class="double">&quot;I take it what ended the last Loop wasn&#039;t normal,&quot; Twilight offered from a couch Celestia had conjured for her to rest on.</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Sleipnir agreed, &quot;it most certainly was not. Nor was your Loop the only one ended so abruptly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How many a&#039; tha Loops were affected?&quot; Applejack asked, already knowing she wasn&#039;t going to like the answer.</p><p class="double">Sleipnir gazed at the gathered loopers very seriously before answering.</p><p class="double">&quot;All of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes nearly popped out of her skull. &quot;Wha– What could possibly do something like that?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir sighed and addressed the room. &quot;I will tell you all I am allowed to, but understand that the restrictions on certain sensitive information means that I am literally incapable of telling it to you. Please sit down, as this may take a while.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So...&quot; Rainbow prompted after everyone was seated.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened was that we lost another Loop,&quot; Sleipnir explained solemnly, &quot;except this time it was particularly catastrophic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean... a whole universe, just gone?&quot; Pinkie&#039;s hair deflated as she began to tear up. &quot;No more parties or loopers to have parties for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Sleipnir nodded, &quot;that is precisely what happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Twilight interrupted, &quot;you said you lost &#039;another&#039; Loop. When has this happened before?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir blinked in surprise and looked directly at Twilight in confusion. &quot;You don&#039;t remember?&quot; When Twilight shook her head, he gained a sour expression. &quot;I told her to fix that, and I&#039;m sure she knew how...&quot; he muttered as his markings began to glow. &quot;No wonder you didn&#039;t remember a Loop being lost before. Hold on a moment.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight did as he asked, and suddenly the memories of Madoka and her friend Homura from that Loop came rushing back. Why would Madoka have not fixed her memory about such an important event if she was able to do so?</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Twilight reoriented herself, &quot;so someone named Madoka, who&#039;s apparently memory–proof, ascended past the dimensional boundaries of her Loop. And then was reunited with the only other surviving looper in one of our Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sleipnir scowled angrily. &quot;She effectively accessed Yggdrasil without authorization or training in order to arrange a fused Loop here to recover her friend, potentially exposing your Loop to the harmful viruses and malware that are no longer properly contained with Yggdrasil damaged as it is. As sympathetic as I am to her plight, I cannot approve of her exposing your Loop to such risk. I was, as you might say, not happy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s... not dangerous, is she?&quot; Twilight asked. Her restored memories showed Madoka as friendly and very much concerned for the well–being of her friend. The idea that she was a bad individual just didn&#039;t compute.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not... inherently,&quot; Sleipnir sighed. &quot;Mostly she is misinformed about the nature of Yggdrasil&#039;s system and inexperienced in how things are done at our level. She is also potentially mentally imbalanced given her seemingly rapid acceptance of the loss of her Loop. There are a number of rumours going around about her, not the least of which are regarding what happened to her friend Homura after her recovery from your Loop, and I hope that some of the more sinister ones prove untrue. Of all the things we really do not need to deal with right now, an insane neophyte goddess is rather high on the list.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Can anything be done to help the poor darling?&quot; Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;The backups of her universe are undamaged,&quot; Sleipnir admitted. &quot;It may be possible to restore it after the Loops end, but with the rather rapid ascension of the only viable Anchor from that universe to the divine level – even if she was manipulated into doing so – restoring it at this time has been deemed to be counterproductive.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who manipulated her?&quot; Spike inquired.</p><p class="double">&quot;Her looping familiar, Kyuubey,&quot; Sleipnir informed the dragon. &quot;An extremely misguided and potentially sociopathic entity dedicated to preventing the collapse of his universe by filling young souls with grief and then persuading other young souls to assist in harvesting them until they too are filled with grief. We remain uncertain if he survived the Loop&#039;s destruction, and request that if you encounter him in the future that you detain him by any means necessary.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, he&#039;s totally not getting a Pinkie Party,&quot; the party pony in question growled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Regardless,&quot; Sleipnir continued, &quot;The collapse of Madoka&#039;s Loop was the best case scenario possible. The most recent event was perhaps the worst case scenario. Yggdrasil taken in the form of a tree would contain the Hub in its trunk with the various Prime universes, or baselines, branching out from it, and a myriad of variant universes further branching out from each of those primary branches. The Anchors keep the primary branches, and all that grow from them, stable. Hub Loops take place where the primary branches meet the trunk rather than the trunk itself, and many fused Loops take place where two or more of the smaller tertiary branches cross one another. The collapse of Madoka&#039;s Loop was like a primary branch cracking a few inches out from the trunk, while the recent collapse was more like the entire branch being ripped off the tree, taking a portion of the trunk with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ouch,&quot; Gilda voiced the general consensus of the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait a sec,&quot; Nyx interjected. &quot;If the Loops are set up with one Anchor per &#039;primary branch&#039;, then how do the Linked Loops work?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir raised an eyebrow at the change of topic, but decided to humour the filly. &quot;Damage to the various universes after the event that initially damaged Yggdrasil was not uniform. The Hub escaped damage due to being the most critical, and thus most protected, portion of Yggdrasil. And while a few other universes remained intact enough that they did not require anchoring like most, the only other universe to escape unscathed was Eiken.&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire room winced at the mention of the widely agreed most aggravating known Loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Some were damaged to the point that a single Anchor was not sufficient, and so they were divided into portions and each portion anchored through the baseline. The Trek Loops were the first successful Linked Loops brought online.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Twilight interrupted. &quot;There are loopers native to the Trek Loops?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Sleipnir nodded. &quot;I understand they like their privacy and rather than gain a wide variety of powers and skills like most loopers, they instead have honed their ability to remain undetected as fellow loopers. I&#039;d tell you who they are, but it would invalidate my wager that you&#039;ll be the first to get proof.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, why...&quot; Twilight facehooved suddenly. &quot;Right. Starfleet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; asked the confused god.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Trek loopers would have to deal with Starfleet, who get reports on everything they do,&quot; Twilight explained. &quot;They regularly deal with a lot of things they can&#039;t possibly have any foreknowledge of, and anyone in Starfleet with half a brain would pick up on them acting with too much foreknowledge and launch an investigation. Which would mean they&#039;d most likely have to explain the Loops every time this happened. That got old for me after a few times trying to convince Celestia that I was Looping before she Awoke. I pretty much gave up except for special occasions after I&#039;d done it a couple dozen times, and Celestia&#039;s the best case scenario.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not entirely sure if I should be flattered,&quot; Celestia joked.</p><p class="double">Twilight simply continued on. &quot;I know Harry Potter still hasn&#039;t forgiven Dumbledore for what he did the times Harry tried to convince him of the Loops early on, and Dumbledore is still relatively benevolent if lacking in common sense. A group of superiors, some of whom may be actively hostile? Yeah, I can see how they&#039;d want to keep their looping status hidden.&quot;</p><p class="double">While the rest of the room nodded in sympathy and understanding, Sleipnir decided to get back to the topic at hand.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, when the collapse affected the Hub, it damaged that universe&#039;s backups. We don&#039;t know what data, if any, survived.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How do backup files work in a system like Yggdrasil anyway?&quot; Twilight inquired. &quot;I mean, I doubt you actually have anything else that could store the kind of data Yggdrasil runs.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very true. Tell me Twilight,&quot; Sleipnir said in the manner of a teacher, &quot;how do <i>you</i> think backup data works in a system like Yggdrasil? I can tell you that almost every Loop currently running we had to fix using backup data. So where do you think it came from?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought hard for a moment before the light of comprehension dawned in her eyes. &quot;Fiction! You back up one universe in another as works of fiction! And the Hub is the only universe that has fiction about every Loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Close,&quot; Sleipnir agreed. &quot;When one universe&#039;s data is stored in another as backup, the inhabitants of the hosting universe inevitably write fiction about the universe being backed up. But you&#039;re right about the Hub. It&#039;s the only universe used to back up all other universes Yggdrasil runs, which is why the Hub itself is being used to Anchor the entire multiverse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Hub is its own Anchor?&quot; Rainbow&#039;s eyes nearly crossed in confusion. &quot;How does that work?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Sleipnir explained. &quot;The Hub is the <i>multiverse&#039;s</i> Anchor, keeping Yggdrasil itself stable through all the other Anchors in the Loops. As a result, damage to the Hub affects the Anchors through that connection and to a lesser extent the other loopers and the entire multiverse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How dost the damage from this event affect us?&quot; Luna asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Loop we lost is simply <i>gone</i>,&quot; Sleipnir reiterated. &quot;At the <i>conceptual</i> level. It effectively never existed. Any fused Loops you had with that universe have now never happened. Aside from the forced system–wide reset of the Loops the collapse triggered, even the divine operators of Yggdrasil have no memory of it beyond an almost completely corrupted file of the &#039;jumpstart&#039; attempt with a fused Loop that ended in its destruction.&quot;</p><p class="double">Eyes were wide around the room as they all tried to wrap their minds around the totality of such destruction.</p><p class="double">&quot;On a more tangible note,&quot; the divine beast continued, &quot;the emergency reset has in all likelihood set every active Looper to &#039;Awake&#039; status across the board, you might even have a few new loopers for added stability. It&#039;s a little hard to tell at the moment as everyone not sent to make sure the Anchors were fine is running around trying to assess the full extent of any secondary damage.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You said that this resulted from a fused Loop as part of a &#039;jumpstart&#039; attempt,&quot; Celestia cut in. &quot;What exactly does that mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Some universes were damaged to the point that we can&#039;t get them properly anchored without the assistance of existing loopers,&quot; Sleipnir answered. &quot;I believe Fluttershy is familiar with one of the more successful Anchors activated this way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean Lemon Rush?&quot; Fluttershy perked up. &quot;Is he okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Gilda gave Fluttershy an incredulous look. &quot;He probably took whatever floored little miss friendship graduate and beat it to a pulp.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sleipnir agreed. &quot;He is a very hardy and stable Anchor. You should be proud.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blushed.</p><p class="double">&quot;But as I was saying,&quot; the eight–legged stallion continued, &quot;the fused Loop was the latest attempt to get a particularly damaged universe to start looping. The baseline suffered severe damages, and even the viable Anchors are all damaged to some extent. And yes,&quot; Sleipnir rolled his eyes as he saw the inevitable tangent forming before him, &quot;this has happened before. When we have a damaged Anchor candidate, it&#039;s standard procedure to move down the list to secondary and even tertiary Anchor candidates to get the Loop functional. Your friends the Turtles are victims of a damaged baseline. Yggdrasil can no longer tell which of their major variants is the true baseline and I understand the situation has created some rather unique mental stress issues. Your friend Sonic has been confined to variant Loops because we still haven&#039;t repaired his baseline to the point where it&#039;s viable. I doubt he&#039;d even recognize his true history at this point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s keeping you from fixing it?&quot; Rainbow interrupted before Sleipnir could get back to the main topic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sonic&#039;s baseline has multiversal travel outside the myriad of branching variants, which creates at least as many headaches as baseline time travel. The DC and Marvel Loops were so hard to get functional that we almost set them to Read–Only, the absolute last resort to keep a universe from being lost. We can&#039;t get Sonic&#039;s baseline functional because not all of the universes that it interacts with in its baseline are looping yet. The universe we were trying to jumpstart is actually the last one we need to finally get Sonic&#039;s baseline fully functional.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the problem you have is...?&quot; Rainbow prodded as if she hadn&#039;t distracted from the topic in the first place.</p><p class="double">&quot;The problem we have,&quot; Sleipnir answered good naturedly, &quot;is that this particular universe was the single most critically damaged of all due to being in closest proximity to the event that caused the initial damage to Yggdrasil. All attempts to get it looping have failed, the latest, as you now know, in a manner that destroyed an existing Loop. The reason why we keep trying is that we think that something in this universe may have born witness to the event that damaged Yggdrasil and give us information that could aid in repairing the damage.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is there anything we can do to help?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing that you do not already do,&quot; Sleipnir apologized. &quot;We can&#039;t risk any other Loops collapsing through contact with this universe until we get it stabilized. And the Loop that was lost... I&#039;m afraid there&#039;s absolutely nothing you can do at all at your current dimensional level, and we&#039;d very much prefer you don&#039;t ascend past the dimensional boundaries of your Loop. Even those of you not the Anchor. While the chance of your Loop being lost is... less than if the Anchor ascends, it&#039;s still rather significant.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We kinda figgered,&quot; Applejack gave Sleipnir a flat stare.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not to say what you all do isn&#039;t helpful,&quot; Sleipnir offered. &quot;Simply looping and remaining metaphysically stable helps more than I&#039;m allowed to say. The fact that you all have, of your own volition, offered sanctuary to other loopers who visit Equestria is more than we could have ever asked of you. That you manage to succeed despite the numerous significantly dangerous hostile entities native to your Loop is nothing short of a miracle. You&#039;ve already managed to avert at least one potential metaphysical collapse of another Anchor, likely saving miss Clearwater&#039;s entire Loop in the process. You have already gone above and beyond the duty assigned to you as loopers, and I hope you all continue to do so. I am honoured beyond words to be your assigned administrator.&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire room blushed at the praise.</p><p class="double">&quot;And do keep up the antics, please.” Sleipnir winked. “I&#039;ve won the &#039;funniest Loop videos&#039; contest a few times now and I&#039;d like to get a good winning streak going.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.13 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stumbled. Waking up in mid–stride was always a pain...even if there were soft, fluffy clouds to land on here.</p><p class="double">And then the loop memories rolled in and Twilight completely forgot her irritation. She was in Cloudsdale&#039;s flight camp as a pegasus filly.</p><p class="double">More importantly, for some reason Twilight was now Rainbow Dash. Literally. Looking at herself revealed she was in Dash&#039;s body. Blue mane, rainbow mane and tail, and...no cutie mark at all.</p><p class="double">Right, because &#039;Rainbow Dash&#039; had just challenged two bullies to a race for her friend Fluttershy&#039;s honour. Fluttershy seemed to be the normal non–looping Fluttershy, but Twilight would double–check her and the rest of her friends later.</p><p class="double">At the moment, a priceless opportunity had appeared. This was the race that Dash had gotten her cutie mark in. Twilight would never have a better chance to earn a different cutie mark from her usual starburst!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">This was it! Twilight tore through the air as she dove for the last ring on the course, feeling the resistance from the sound barrier build and build...and BREAK!</p><p class="double"><b>BOOM!</b></p><p class="double">Rocketing upwards, Twilight could see the Sonic Rainboom roll out below her. In Dash&#039;s body, she had Dash&#039;s magical signature, so it still looked the same. And as she felt the tingle on her flanks, Twilight&#039;s gaze eagerly turned to her new cutie mark –</p><p class="double">– of her familiar starburst. Granted, each star was a different colour this time, but still!</p><p class="double">&quot;OH COME ON!&quot;</p><p class="double">Later, Twilight would hypothesize that since the Sonic Rainboom had formed a connection between her and her friends, it fell under &#039;the magic of friendship&#039;. Right now, she was just incredibly disappointed. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.14 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around her as she Awoke. Grass! The book! THE TREE! She laughed out loud, kissing the ground and rolling in the field. &quot;Equestria again! Thank Celestia, Equestria again!&quot;</p><p class="double">It took her some time to stop celebrating, but eventually she managed to contain herself. She tilted her head, concentrating, and with a flash a tiara appeared on her forehead. Her face broke out into a wide grin. She quickly concentrated on ascending, then teleported off. A moment later she teleported back, carefully picking up the book, before teleporting away again.</p><p class="double">The library! Exactly as she remembered, exactly as she recalled from loop after loop after loop! She ran her hooves over the shelves, giggling like a schoolfilly. Home. Nothing like...</p><p class="double">Her joy faded.</p><p class="double">Nothing like.... that loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Twilight!&quot; Dash walked in with a smile. &quot;You&#039;re here early! I gotta admit that experiment we did was pretty neat, what are we going to do next?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight said nothing.</p><p class="double">The pegasus frowned, walking up to her friend and gently poking her. &quot;Um... Twi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was a high school.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My last loop. High school. Human. Nobody else awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash noticed the tremor in her voice. &quot;Um... That... kind of sounds like it would be something an egghead like you would love–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I COULDN&#039;T STUDY!&quot; Twilight whirled around, tears in her eyes. &quot;Every time, every time I tried, some, something happened! A guy would, or, or sometimes even a girl, and, and there were clubs! Actual clubs that people kept trying to pressure me into! I just wanted to learn! I didn&#039;t want, to, to... to....&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender alicorn folded in on herself, starting to cry. Rainbow, awkwardly, wrapped her in a hug as she rocked back and forth. &quot;...you&#039;re back here, Twilight. Nopony will... I&#039;ll make sure you&#039;re left alone for as long as you need it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...and I couldn&#039;t stop them,&quot; she murmured. &quot;There was too much of... of me for them to, to, and the back pain, and my magic didn&#039;t work, and the force didn&#039;t work, and I couldn&#039;t access my subspace pocket...&quot; Twilight turned to her friend. &quot;We&#039;re never experimenting with the sun again. I don&#039;t want go back there. I never want to go back there.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">45.15</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s just <i>brilliant,</i>” Twilight said with a sigh. “Trixie got inducted into a cult.”</p><p class="double">“To be honest,” Chrysalis supplied, eyes somewhat unfocussed, “she&#039;s only pretending to go along with it. She&#039;s a good actor.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Ah, mind link, of course.” Twilight nodded. “Any plans?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not entirely sure I&#039;m permitted to attack them.” Shining frowned. “They&#039;re Inevitables, right? Those are supposed to be things of order. And, you know... paladin...”</p><p class="double">“They&#039;re broken.” Twilight shrugged. “Definitely not both good and orderly, at most one of the above.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” The paladin touched his maul. “Good to know.”</p><p class="double">“Hey,” Gilda said suddenly. “Paladins are holy warriors, right? Whose are you?”</p><p class="double">Cadence waved.</p><p class="double">“Is that allowed?” Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">“Apparently. I suspect Cadence might well be a Favoured Soul of Shining, as well.” Twilight drew a crude map on the floor. “Okay, here&#039;s the plan...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Three, two, one...”</p><p class="double">“Wait!” Cadence hissed, just before they all started casting or charging. “Look.”</p><p class="double">Through the slight haze of Twilight&#039;s Invisibility Sphere, they could see that Trixie was waving a hoof.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Trixie said, clearing her throat. “Ah–herm. I am glad to be able to speak to the full roster of the Redeemed. I would like to say something very important.”</p><p class="double">The variety of crazy Inevitables and cultist followers looked at her expectantly.</p><p class="double">“Friends, Redeemed, and fellow travellers,” she began, and took a deep breath. “Maximized Empowered Twinned Concussive Sonic Wild Surge <i>ENERGY BURST!</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Now that&#039;s what I call a distraction,” Twilight said approvingly, as cultists went flying and dust rained down from the ceiling.</p><p class="double">“Shut up and attack!” Gilda shouted, blade already humming as she launched herself forward.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cadence frowned down at Trixie. “Are you alright?”</p><p class="double">“Table for two please!” Trixie said clearly.</p><p class="double">“Apparently not...” She lit her horn, raised Trixie onto her hooves, and slapped a Restoration spell on her. “How much power did you use?”</p><p class="double">“All of it,” Trixie said, sounding slightly hurt. “Why do you even ask?”</p><p class="double">“Figures.” Chrysalis trotted over, rolling her eyes. “Okay, Trix. If you&#039;re this determined to stick to the rules of the loop, I&#039;d better at least recharge you.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis lowered her head to touch her horn to Trixie&#039;s, and after a moment her horn lit with a soft green light.</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s horn answered about ten seconds later, and a full minute passed before they separated.</p><p class="double">“All fine?” Trixie asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Chrysalis replied. “That&#039;s a good power combo Twilight worked out for me, you know... full recharge is <i>so</i> convenient.”</p><p class="double">She touched Trixie on the nose. “But make sure you at least think of an escape plan next time!”</p><p class="double">“Escape plan?” Trixie looked dubious. “Why would I need one of those?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nipped her shoulder. “You know very well why. Resurrections are expensive.”</p><p class="double">There was a shower of sparks in the background, as Gilda and Shining took turns poking one of the Inevitables. Neither of the psions noticed.</p><p class="double">Then something flashed next to them.</p><p class="double">Trixie whirled, her horn already lit with an Energy Blast. “Cadence!”</p><p class="double">Cadence stowed the camera in her subspace pocket. “That&#039;s one for the album. You looked so cute!”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sighed, tapping a hoof on the floor. <i>It&#039;s going to take a long time to live that one down...</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">45.16</p><p class="double">“Ah, I&#039;ve always wanted to see the Gryphon Lands,” Rarity said, gazing out the window.</p><p class="double">Spike chuckled, kneeling beside her. “I&#039;m fairly sure you&#039;ve been before. In fact, didn&#039;t you invade once?”</p><p class="double">“That was just one time,” Rarity replied, blushing. “I had... self control issues.”</p><p class="double">“I know, I know.” Spike kissed her cheek, feeling an electric thrill run through him at the contact. Though they&#039;d been dating for <i>so</i> long, and <i>really</i> serious for a large fraction of that... being actually married made it all new again.</p><p class="double">Rarity returned the favour, nuzzling into his neck. “You know what I mean, of course. It&#039;s rare that we get to just look around.”</p><p class="double">There was a muted <i>whump</i> from the gas bag of the huge airship. From experience, both of them recognized it as heated air being released from the balloonets.</p><p class="double">“There goes the superheat,” Spike commented. “Not long until we arrive now.”</p><p class="double">Rarity grinned. “Not tempted to fly down?”</p><p class="double">“Well, a bit...” he allowed.</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave it some serious thought.</p><p class="double">“No, let&#039;s just use the docks as normal. It&#039;s been a long trip, and I feel like a nice dinner.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;m... sorry?” the waiter asked politely. “You would like the vegetarian option?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Rarity said patiently. “I&#039;m a <i>pony.</i> We don&#039;t eat meat.”</p><p class="double">“I am not sure that anyone has ordered the vegetarian option... since I was first hired, actually,” he admitted. “I will see if the chefs can remember how to do it.”</p><p class="double">“Not a good sign,” Spike said with a wince as the griffin walked off.</p><p class="double">“No, it isn&#039;t.” Rarity sighed. “I wonder where Blueblood ate when he came here last?”</p><p class="double">“In his suite.” Spike rolled his eyes. “I spoke with the servants who came here with him, once. They just ate fast food.”</p><p class="double">“My most sincere apologies, madam,” the waiter said, eyes downcast as he returned. “None of the chefs can recall what an aubergine looks like in the first place, let alone how to cook it.”</p><p class="double">“Oh well,” Spike said, shrugging, and reached into a pouch slung across his torso. Extracting a few bits, he tossed them to the waiter. “Not your fault.”</p><p class="double">Accepting the tip, the waiter bowed them out, still apologizing.</p><p class="double">“Well, that was a bust...” Rarity looked ruefully back at the five-star restaurant. “I suppose that&#039;s the downside of foreign food.”</p><p class="double">“Gustav was alright...” Spike shrugged. “Maybe he left because he wasn&#039;t properly respected, though. Well, looks like it&#039;s fast food time.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You know,” Rarity said, staring up at the stars, “I&#039;m surprised just how many kinds of fast food the Griffins have.” She levitated a nut out of their bag and slit it open with delicate care, then hovered the meat of the nut over to Spike.</p><p class="double">Spike cracked a walnut, ate the bits Rarity had passed him, then returned the favour. “Well, we tend to think of the Gryphon Lands as a country, like ours – formed from, fundamentally, a single source of colonists. But this is a continent of diverse tastes.”</p><p class="double">He bit off the end of a kebab skewer, and chewed thoughtfully on the peppers, chicken and iron. “How&#039;s yours?”</p><p class="double">“Convenient.” Rarity lifted herself a little to better eat the pita. “I&#039;m a little surprised they do a vegetarian version of this, though.”</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s so you can taste the cheese.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So.” Rarity wiped her mouth with a napkin. “What should we do tomorrow?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m thinking... the temple complex at Hightown. You know, that one built into the side of a cliff.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good.”</p><p class="double">It also sounded a little scary, of course... but with Spike there, Rarity didn&#039;t feel afraid of falling.</p><p class="double">That she could literally grow wings on the way down helped, too.

<p>46.1 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;This is just weird,&quot; Sweetie Belle commented at recess. &quot;I mean, none of us had any plans to shake things up. Well, outside of Trixie&#039;s thing with the dragon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That was more a &#039;what would she do&#039; then anything,&quot; Scootaloo pointed out. &quot;And it&#039;s still early in the loop. Maybe Diamond has some sort of secret prank she&#039;s planning on Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shook her head. &quot;Nnnnno. No, Ah don&#039;t think she was planning anythang. No offence to ya&#039;ll but... Well, Ah can read her better then you two, and she seemed pretty normal yesterday.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think she got sick?&quot; Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;If she were sick Filthy Rich would have sent Cheerilee a note,&quot; Sweetie pointed out, glancing at the schoolhouse. &quot;Do you think we should check in on her?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom looked across the playground. &quot;Maybe... but first we should go talk to Silver over thar.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crusaders all turned toward the little grey filly sitting alone on a bench, her tail flicking idly as she focused on quietly chewing her food. She&#039;d glance up, occasionally, taking in her classmates playing around before she simply sighed and returned to snipping off tiny bites of her meal.</p><p class="double">&quot;...yeah, that might be a good idea,&quot; Sweetie agreed. &quot;She doesn&#039;t look too happy.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three of them trotted over to the bench, Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle sitting to either side of Silver Spoon as Scootaloo stood off to the side. The grey filly glance up and them and sneered, her eyes almost completely free of tears. &quot;What do <i>you</i> all want?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo raised an eyebrow. &quot;Well, I personally want to revolutionize the field of aeronautics and join the Wonderbolts. I&#039;m pretty sure Sweetie here wants to become a pop star, and Apple Bloom wants to build an army of robots to do her bidding.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not an army,&quot; Apple Bloom countered blandly. &quot;Ah&#039;d be fine with a small squad o&#039; twelve, Ah&#039;m not greedy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon blinked at them. &quot;...what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You asked us what we wanted,&quot; Scootaloo explained.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, see – what do you want with <i>me?</i>&quot; the grey filly demanded, trying to get a hold of the situation.</p><p class="double">&quot;We saw ya sitting here alone and we figured... nopony should be alone.&quot; Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Cliche, yeah, but....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t want to talk to <i>you,</i>&quot; Silver grumbled, picking up her lunch and standing. &quot;I&#039;m going somewhere else.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle put a gentle hoof on her shoulder. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. Whatever we did... I&#039;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pushed the hoof off and glared at the unicorn. &quot;Look, I don&#039;t know where she is, so stop bugging me!&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom tilted her head. &quot;Where who is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Diamond Tiara!&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rolled her eyes. &quot;What does Tiara have to do with anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I...&quot; Silver faltered, but rallied herself quickly. &quot;That&#039;s obviously why you&#039;re talking to me! You want to find, find out where she is!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We <i>are</i> worried about her,&quot; Sweetie allowed, &quot;but right now we&#039;re honestly more concerned about you. Diamond can take care of herself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There! That!&quot; Silver Spoon pointed at the unicorn. &quot;How do you KNOW that?! You&#039;ve only been friends with her for, like, a week! And somehow she&#039;s... not her! You changed her!&quot;</p><p class="double">The crusaders shared a look. Ah.</p><p class="double">&quot;And what was that?! What aren&#039;t you–?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She still considers you a friend,&quot; Sweetie interjected swiftly. &quot;Really. We never meant to steal her from you... it&#039;s just...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think Silver would believe us without proof,&quot; Scootaloo interjected. &quot;And, well... you know what Nyx told us about how Twilight felt when Fleur and Flash ended up, um–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m right here!&quot; the grey filly huffed. &quot;Why are you ignoring me?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom took a breath. &quot;...Silver, there is... a really big secret, but Ah think it should be up ta Diamond whether we tell ya or not.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right, let me guess. You&#039;re all princesses.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo grinned broadly.</p><p class="double">&quot;...no.&quot; Silver Spoon boggled. &quot;You&#039;re joking, that can&#039;t be right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Scoots, stop messing with her mind.&quot; Sweetie Belle rolled her eyes. &quot;No, we aren&#039;t princesses.&quot; <i>This loop, anyway...</i> &quot;Look... Diamond Tiara really cares about you. Really. She&#039;s always worried when you&#039;re not around.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...she is?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom nodded solemnly. &quot;Yep. Can&#039;t get through a day without wondering if she should have brought you along...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....oh.&quot; The grey filly scuffed at the ground, not meeting their eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You know,&quot; Sweetie Belle mused, &quot;real friends will forgive each other no matter what. Even after the worst argument.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver&#039;s eyes snapped up. &quot;How did you know about that--?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were telegraphing it so obviously that even <i>I</i> noticed,&quot; Scootaloo deadpanned.</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave her a look. &quot;I was trying to be <i>subtle.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever you said can&#039;t have been that bad, though,&quot; Scootaloo continued obliviously.</p><p class="double">&quot;I said I hated her and wished she&#039;d change back to normal...&quot; Silver admitted quietly.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom sighed. &quot;Tell ya what. You get miss Cheerilee to set whatever assignments she has for us aside, and we&#039;ll go find Diamond so that you two can talk. Alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I...&quot; Silver Spoon sighed. &quot;...Alright...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.2 (misterq)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;We have a pattern... Red? No, w..white? A pink pattern? What does this mean?&quot; Misato stared at the screen.</p><p class="double">Shinji blinked, trying to sort through his extensive loop memories. A pink pattern could mean one of a few different types of looping angels. He kind of hoped it would be the angel version of Dan Hibiki.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where is it?&quot; the third child asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s nearby. The magi are having a hard time locking on. It&#039;s over the water, no wait – twenty miles out. Fifteen miles southwest. Now it&#039;s three miles to the north. I can&#039;t pinpoint its location.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you tried looking right behind you?&quot; asked a high pitched, yet helpful voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, we haven&#039;t looked......&quot; Misato stopped mid-sentence and everyone in the NERV control center slowly turned around.</p><p class="double">Shinji paled as he recognized that particular pink-coated pony, who was now apparently the fourth angel – Pinkiel.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there!&quot; the adorable abomination chirped. &quot;Do you all like parties?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shinji thought frantically. He remembered what a looping Pinkie Pie was capable of. Still, there had to be a safe way of diffusing the situation.</p><p class="double">That was when his father pulled out his pistol and fired six rapid shots at the pink pony – who was suddenly no longer standing where she had been.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! You got me gifts!&quot; Pinkie was now on top of a computer monitor, balancing on her back two legs while happily juggling six spent bullets, &quot;But I didn&#039;t get you anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I can show you a magic trick! Watch this! Nothing up my sleeves,&quot; The pink pony gestured at her front forelegs and giggled, adding, &quot;Because I&#039;m naked!&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she reached behind her back and into her mane and pulled out a large cupcake. A cupcake topped with the embryo of Adam, the first angel.</p><p class="double">One quick gulp later and it was gone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmm! Instrumentalicious!&quot; Pinkie licked her lips of any loose crumbs as she started glowing, &quot;Oh, I guess that&#039;s the ball game. Go team Angel!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a bright flash of light.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Get up Shinji! You&#039;ll be late for school.&quot;</p><p class="double">After having more than a few loops together, Shinji recognized the voice to be his mother&#039;s.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m awake. What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">Yui Ikari walked into his bedroom, &quot;Did you stay up too late yesterday? If you want, I can call your school and tell them you partied too hard yesterday.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Partied? What was yesterday?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yesterday was a party day,&quot; Shinji only now realized that his mother was wearing a t-shirt that read, &#039;If you can read this, you&#039;re far too sober!</p><p class="double">&quot;Party day?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right. A day dedicated to celebrating the joy and wonder found in life. But don&#039;t worry, Shin-chan. Today is a party day, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are... are there any days that are not party days?&quot;</p><p class="double">Yui looked aghast at such a thought, &quot;What would be the fun of a non-&#039;party day&#039; day? Now I&#039;m off to work at the balloon factory. If you decide to go to school, bus fare is on the table. I&#039;ll have to stop by your father&#039;s work and make sure he gets the lunch he forgot. I swear, he would leave his head if he didn&#039;t need it for his job managing the cookie mines.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shinji just stared as his mother put on a silly party hat and left the apartment. Happy dance music could be heard outside while the front door was open. He went to the living room and cautiously turned on the television. A lady dressed as a harlequin was announcing the weather – an eighty percent chance of confetti with possible flurries of glitter later in the evening.</p><p class="double">The former Eva pilot just sat there in a dazed state on his couch, only barely noticing that it was made from one giant marshmallow. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(addendum, from FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">I Am.</p><p class="double">Or Am I?

Is there a guide for this somewhere?</p><p class="double">Anyway... oh, right, all the ominous threats and &quot;Grr, I&#039;m awesome, fear me&quot; stuff. And something about &quot;the Base Earth,&quot; but really, that just seems kind of racist. Unless it&#039;s in the sense of there being an Acid Earth somewhere.</p><p class="double">What? What do you mean I&#039;m out of time? Who&#039;s in charge of this recording studio, anyway?</p><p class="double"><i>Fiiiine</i>.</p><p class="double">I am the Pony of Celebration.</p><p class="double">The Joy of Faust.</p><p class="double">I am Pinkiel. I have come. To party. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.3</p><p class="double">“Observe, Ponyville, the multitudinous talents of the Great and Powerful Trixie!” Trixie called, setting off a few fireworks.</p><p class="double">“Why do I have to wear the bunny suit?” Chrysalis grumbled.</p><p class="double">“For two reasons. First, all magicians&#039; assistants have to wear sparkly bunny suits,” Trixie informed her.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked unimpressed. Her current form was that of a black-coated pegasus with a crystalline flower for a cutie mark, so the bunny suit merely looked <i>mostly</i> ridiculous.</p><p class="double">“Second,” Trixie coughed. “I like seeing you in a bunny suit.”</p><p class="double">At that, the disguised Changeling perked up a bit.</p><p class="double">There were a few chuckles from those of the audience close enough to hear the by-play.</p><p class="double">“Right!” Trixie said, getting back into the swing of things. “The first trick that the Great and Powerful Trixie shall do, is the disappearing coin trick!”</p><p class="double">She looked over to Chrysalis. “Lend me a coin, will you?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not falling for that again!” Chrysalis protested. “Not after the last fifty times.”</p><p class="double">More giggles.</p><p class="double">“Fine then.” Trixie looked off into the distance for a moment, theatrically sighing and frowning. “What about this?”</p><p class="double">She reached behind Chrysalis&#039; ear, and pulled a bit from behind it.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s just pathetic,” Chrysalis griped. “I&#039;ve seen that before.”</p><p class="double">Another bit fell out from behind her ear. Then another. With a clinking rush of wealth, at least fifty bits poured out from behind Chrysalis&#039; ear, leaving her looking quite confused.</p><p class="double">“Oh, so <i>that&#039;s</i> where they keep disappearing to,” Trixie said, nodding. “Mystery solved.”</p><p class="double">“Are there any more back there?” Chrysalis asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">Trixie reached back again, this time with both hooves. “Hold on a minute, I think there is something...”</p><p class="double">There was a series of <i>clang</i> noises. Then the sound of something heavy falling over, a croak as though from a frog, two snatches of music, and the noise a plate makes when it spins around on the floor.</p><p class="double">“Got it!” Trixie announced, flourishing her prize – a large red stick with a lit fuse.</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Chrysalis pointed. “Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“Use my title!” Trixie snapped, waving the stick around.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rolled her eyes. “Oh, Great and Powerful Trixie. You&#039;re holding an explosive.”</p><p class="double">“Eh?” Trixie brought it up to her face to examine it.</p><p class="double">BOOM.</p><p class="double">Both unicorn and faux-pegasus blinked away soot from their eyes.</p><p class="double">“...ignore that!” Trixie called, wiping her face clean with a towel. “Now, where was Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, you tell me,” Chrysalis snarked.</p><p class="double">“Ah, the classic! A rabbit from a hat!” Trixie swept her hat off her head, reached in up to the shoulder, and pulled out Angel.</p><p class="double">“Ta-da!”</p><p class="double">Angel bit her hoof.</p><p class="double">“Ow!” Trixie leapt a foot into the air. “Chryssy! Catch that bunny!”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis lunged forward, missed Angel completely, and fell into the hat.</p><p class="double">Angel bounced off, throwing a carrot as a parting shot.</p><p class="double">“...oops.” Trixie picked up her hat and shook it. “Are you okay in there?”</p><p class="double">“Get me out of here!” a slightly echoey version of Chrysalis&#039; voice demanded.</p><p class="double">Trixie turned the hat upside down and shook it. Two more rabbits (less violent than Angel), a cheese wedge, a spare cloak, three magazines and a wardrobe crashed out.</p><p class="double">Then there was a loud splash, and some water pattered out of the opening.</p><p class="double">“Are you in the swimming pool?” Trixie asked, moving the hat right side up again.</p><p class="double">“Not quite,” Chrysalis replied, over the sound of running water. “I think this might be the games room.”</p><p class="double">Trixie frowned. “There&#039;s no water in the games room!”</p><p class="double">“There is now,” Chrysalis said grimly. “Hold on, I can see the opening.”</p><p class="double">With an ungraceful <i>splat</i>, a black pegasus flew upside down out of the hat&#039;s innards and promptly crashed into the stage.</p><p class="double">Trixie put her hat back on (resulting in a rush of water) and lifted Chrysalis off the floor. “The rabbit escaped.”</p><p class="double">“I do not care in the slightest,” Chrysalis said distinctly. “What now?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Trixie has not done the saw-a-pony-in-half trick-”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis turned to go.</p><p class="double">“-but she supposes it may be possible to skip that?” Trixie tried.</p><p class="double">The pegasus stopped. “You&#039;d better.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“We have clearly hit on a winning formula,” Trixie said over tea that evening.</p><p class="double">“No kidding,” Spike said, putting a plate of biscuits on the table. “That was hilarious!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m glad you approve...” Chrysalis muttered. Somehow, the bunny outfit had survived unscathed through the hour or so of... postmodern magic show?</p><p class="double">“I notice that it introduced you both to Ponyville quite nicely, though,” Twilight said encouragingly.</p><p class="double">“True.” Chrysalis then shot a look over at Twilight. “Has that extra suite for Trixie and I been finished yet?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, it usually is by now when you want to stay here,” Twilight confirmed.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Chrysalis grinned suddenly. “The hive mind thinks I&#039;ve gone a bit strange, though.”</p><p class="double">“Is that-”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s accounting for the loops, yes.” The Changeling Queen then shrugged. “But it&#039;s clearly working, so they don&#039;t exactly mind.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.4</p><p class="double">“Okay, here we go.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom poured out the pre-programmed mycelium vial.</p><p class="double">The billions of tiny nanomachines suspended in solution spread as a golden haze over the surface of their target rock, eating into it, then spread to others as it turned to dust. It grew more like a plant than a machine, sinking roots into the ground and spreading micron-thin solar film to gather energy.</p><p class="double">About two minutes in, a quiet signal from Cookie indicated that the mycelium had obtained access to sufficient magically charged crystal to initiate a crystal turbine, supplying additional power and accelerating the growth process markedly.</p><p class="double">In some ways, the slow progress it was making was annoying for the engineering specialist. It would go much better in a world where electricity was common, as opposed to a small number of hydro dams.</p><p class="double">But, well, she had the time for it.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d say... about a week,” she muttered to herself.</p><p class="double">That should give it time to properly dig out the areas of space for her lab, shore them up so the roof wouldn&#039;t be troubled, and get to work building the larger machinery she was going to need.</p><p class="double">It would also give her time to select a suitable drydock location, of course. And for the inevitable arguments with the other Crusaders about just what each of them wanted to have built this loop and what would be fair.</p><p class="double">(They were still resentful of her little trick with HMS Dreadnought. Just a bit.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That can&#039;t be fair!” Scootaloo protested. “We&#039;re starting only twenty miles apart?”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Sweetie replied, eyeing the Skokaku-class aircraft carrier floating just offshore. “If we started at much further than that, then it&#039;d be a full day of you just bombing us all to bits. We <i>know</i> aircraft carriers are longer ranged-”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, and I&#039;m kinda annoyed that I&#039;m getting so nerfed by this.” Scootaloo twitched her wings. “Besides, have you <i>seen</i> how many flak guns Applebloom&#039;s got on that ridiculous <i>Yamato</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t bring the <i>Yamato</i> into this,” Applebloom said, sitting back and crossing her hooves.</p><p class="double">“Oh, for crying out loud!” Nyx slammed a hoof on the floor. “We built the things, now are we going to use them or just spend all day arguing?”</p><p class="double">Sullen muttering trailed off into silence.</p><p class="double">“Right. Now, as the referee I&#039;ll make the decision. Start fifty kilometres apart.”</p><p class="double">All of them started complaining.</p><p class="double">“See?” she pointed out. “At least all of you are unhappy.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, then, fine.” Tiara shook her head. “I suppose that&#039;ll be alright.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A dozen dive bombers tipped over, one by one, sailing down towards the mammoth battleship which was their target.</p><p class="double">Which seemed to explode beneath them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo blinked, reading off the reports in her high-tech plotting room as her entire first strike disintegrated. “Okay, what. Applebloom?” A chat connection opened. “What the hay did you just do?”</p><p class="double">“Shotgun rounds for the main guns,” Applebloom replied mischeviously. “They were part of the original equipment, but I... fixed a few glaring problems.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo sighed. “Okay, that sucks.”</p><p class="double">The connection blanked out for a moment, as the <i>Yamato</i> fired a full broadside. “Oh, hey, Tiara turned up. Stand still, dang nabbit!”</p><p class="double">The pegasus giggled; having sunk her entire allowance of resources into a destroyer flotilla at least twenty strong, Tiara was going to be a pain for any of the others to take out.</p><p class="double">That just left Sweetie to make an appearance. And she&#039;d kept her setup secret from the others, so...</p><p class="double">With a button press, Scootaloo closed the connection and started putting together a torpedo bomber strike.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The last of the fifteen Avengers rose gently from her flight deck, circled once to join the rest of the formation, and set off towards the madly evading battleship over the horizon. (A Catalina loitering well above any possible counterfire was still reporting on the battle – <i>Yamato</i> was hit once by a torpedo but still game, and Tiara was down to fifteen destroyers. Scootaloo wanted to be able to hit the winner before they could head for her.)</p><p class="double">She took a moment out on the flight deck to watch them leave. It kinda sucked that she couldn&#039;t fly the attacks herself, but – well, there weren&#039;t enough of her, and everypony who knew the Shadow Clone technique had decided not to teach it to the Crusaders. For some reason.</p><p class="double">Then Scootaloo spotted an unusual wave pattern just off the bow.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx adjusted her binoculars. “This would be so much easier if I&#039;d thought to have them make a plotting board for me...”</p><p class="double">With a bright flash, Scootaloo appeared. “Oh, come on! First down <i>again?</i>”</p><p class="double">The alicorn turned to her. “Hi, Scoots. What got you?”</p><p class="double">“Sweetie Belle.” Scootaloo removed the teleport harness, grumbling. “Ever heard of a submarine with a twelve-inch gun fitted to it? &#039;cause I have now.”</p><p class="double">Fire and flame belched out from the Yamato&#039;s position, and Diamond Tiara appeared in another flare of light. “Hard left and... oh, <i>shrub.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Shotgun rounds?” Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">“Shotgun rounds,” Tiara confirmed. </p><p class="double">They settled down to watch.</p><p class="double">“Hey, I found out what Sweetie&#039;s driving,” Scootaloo volunteered. “Submarine monitor.”</p><p class="double">Tiara giggled. “Now that&#039;ll be a surprise.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom put her spanner down. “Counterfloodin&#039; successful.”</p><p class="double">The compartments were sealed, stopping any more water getting into <i>Yamato</i>, and adding water into the port side of the ship had got her back onto an even keel.</p><p class="double">Now the only question was, where were the others?</p><p class="double">Gunfire started, with the small quick-firers blazing away on the port side. By the sound of things, Scootaloo&#039;s second strike was on the way in... torpedo bombers this time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The torpedo bomber strike hadn&#039;t been much trouble, not with the ridiculously heavy AA complement of <i>Yamato.</i> It was confusing that they&#039;d all come in on the same vector, not at all like Scoots&#039; normal flair for air tactics, but Applebloom wasn&#039;t complaining.</p><p class="double">But it was over an hour later, and still no sign of another attack. The Catalina buzzing around keeping an eye on her was getting nerve-wracking, as it happened.</p><p class="double">And there was this nagging feeling she&#039;d forgotten something.</p><p class="double">Then the <i>Jaws</i> theme started playing.</p><p class="double">“Sweetie?” Applebloom asked, checking the radar.</p><p class="double">“Peek-a-boo!” Sweetie&#039;s voice said gleefully, and then there was a very loud bang.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Ah, fiddlesticks,” Applebloom muttered. “No wonder she kept it secret...”</p><p class="double">“I could have taken her,” Tiara proclaimed. “I have ASDIC.”</p><p class="double">“Had,” Scootaloo corrected.</p><p class="double">“Er...” Nyx looked down from the cloud. “Any idea when she&#039;s coming up 3?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.5</p><p class="double">“Right,” Queen Twilight said, with a deep sigh. “Now, since you&#039;re all past your majority-”</p><p class="double">She broke off to glare at Nyx. “<i>And</i> you. I&#039;ve been keeping track.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked embarrassed, then with a flash of magic aged up to the same as her sisters. They looked somewhere between just-post-elements Luna and Cadence.</p><p class="double">“You mean she wasn&#039;t just ageing slowly?” Diamond Tiara asked Applebloom.</p><p class="double">Applebloom shrugged. “As if I&#039;d know.”</p><p class="double">“As I was saying,” Twilight resumed, ignoring the peanut gallery. “Since you&#039;ve reached adulthood, you get to take on responsibility.”</p><p class="double">“Do we have to?” Scootaloo asked with a hint of whine.</p><p class="double">“Scootaloo,” Twilight said pointedly. “Why are we currently in the New Annexe?”</p><p class="double">“...&#039;cause we burned down Canterlot Palace, the Old Annexe and the Canterhorn,” Scootaloo admitted. “Tryin&#039; to get a princess specialization for something something volcano.”</p><p class="double">“Turns out that a volcano isn&#039;t just a mountain doused in resinous pine sap and set alight,” Sweetie added. “Who knew?”</p><p class="double">“Everypony who&#039;s ever looked at a geology textbook?” Tiara asked.</p><p class="double">“Shush, you&#039;re not helping.”</p><p class="double">“As I was saying,” Twilight dragged them back on topic, “I&#039;ve been sorting out various catastrophes you lot have been causing for just about half of my time awake for the last fifteen years.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, four of those years were before we Awoke,” Sweetie said with a pout. “Those don&#039;t count!”</p><p class="double">“In short, I need a break. Seriously. Divide things up amongst yourselves, I&#039;m off for a nap. And the country better be in good shape when I get back!”</p><p class="double">Twilight flashed purple, and vanished. In her place was an ornate document assigning the five of them as co-princesses regnant.</p><p class="double">They were all silent for a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“...hey, cool,” Sweetie said eventually. “I know how this is supposed to work. Mom&#039;s away for the day-”</p><p class="double">“-century,” Applebloom contributed, nodding up at the sky. They looked, and saw a constellation spread across half the night.</p><p class="double">It was a good likeness.</p><p class="double">“When did she learn that?” Tiara wondered.</p><p class="double">“I <i>did</i> overhear her say that moons were a bit passé a few loops ago,” Nyx volunteered. “She may have gotten tips from Okami Shiranui about it.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway. She&#039;s away for a while, and... well, the usual thing to do is party.”</p><p class="double">“Can we really sustain it for a century?” Applebloom asked, then frowned and got out a computer. “Actually, we probably <i>could</i>. For given values of party.”</p><p class="double">“Golden age?” Scootaloo suggested. “Dances every night? Flowering of art and culture? Designated ruler and the rest of us getting drunk?”</p><p class="double">“This might be a bad idea...” Nyx said, nervously.</p><p class="double">“Oh, sure,” Applebloom said with a shrug. “We&#039;re not stupid, we&#039;ll stop if it&#039;s not working. But – well, look at it this way. When have we <i>ever</i> had a chance to have proper college-style parties?”</p><p class="double">“Looking at it that way, it&#039;s good for us.” Sweetie put on a pious expression, fooling precisely nopony. “Experiences we haven&#039;t had before.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara grinned. “Bet I can make a real archaeologist&#039;s dream of a jewellery industry!”</p><p class="double"></p><p>46.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Silver Spoon stared at her friend.</p><p class="double">Well.... at the pony that had once been her friend and probably would be again once she finished processing this.</p><p class="double">&quot;...this is crazy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara tapped her hoof against the table. &quot;Yeah, it&#039;s... pretty insane. Especially since...&quot; She trailed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;...since...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Erm. The entire reason you&#039;re Awake now is, uh...&quot; The pink filly sighed. &quot;You know how I said we&#039;re not the only universe? One of the other universes just... collapsed.&quot; She shuddered. &quot;Gone. Completely. Like... even the memories of that universe are gone, and all the admins have are a few corrupted files. Every loop just went through a hard reset because of that, and most of them have new loopers. And, uh... that&#039;s you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon blinked.</p><p class="double">For a moment she sat completely still.</p><p class="double">Then she started hyperventilating. &quot;GONE? Barely a trace and, and, a whole world and all those ponies and that could happen to us without warning and we have no idea when any of these problems are going to be fixed and–&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond&#039;s hooves slammed onto the table as she shoved her face into Silver&#039;s. &quot;ZIP YOUR LIPS! It&#039;s the job of the ponies up top to worry! <i>Your</i> job is to keep yourself as sane as possible and in the trenches while the world loops! I don&#039;t ever want to catch you thinking about problems you can&#039;t solve, is that clear filly?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;...y&#039;sm&#039;m...&quot;</p><p class="double"></i>After a moment, the stern face pulled back and morphed into something somewhat recognizable. &quot;I&#039;m... sorry about that. You didn&#039;t deserve to see me as a drill Sargent, I just... I didn&#039;t know how to comfort you. I&#039;m... not good with that.&quot; Diamond sighed. &quot;In all seriousness, when it comes to Yggdrasil, you should leave things to the admins. They make mistakes, but... they know what they&#039;re doing for the most part.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them sat quietly for a long while.</p><p class="double">&quot;...you&#039;ve changed,&quot; Silver Spoon said finally.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve had literally millennia of experiences,&quot; Diamond Tiara pointed out. &quot;Occasionally in one loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Silver Spoon pushed her chair back and got up. &quot;I... I&#039;m sorry. This is... I... Miss Twilight is this anchor pony, right?&quot; She trotted toward the door. &quot;I, I think I&#039;ll go talk to her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Silver wait! We&#039;re still friends... right?&quot;</p><p class="double">The grey filly paused, her hoof on the door. &quot;...Are we? I mean, <i>we.</i> Because you&#039;re not the the Tiara I know and... let&#039;s face it, if you&#039;re right, you&#039;ve passed over millions of Silver Spoons before me. I... maybe one day we&#039;ll be friends. Real friends. But right now... we don&#039;t even really know each other, the real each other, Tiara.&quot; She shook her head, not looking back. &quot;I would love it if we became friends but right now... no.

Supporting the technologies which she knew would work, prodding at inventors to produce faster results, even occasionally slipping a paper or two into the publication schedule under an assumed name when the intellectual community got a little stuck.</p><p class="double">And the latest drive system was... well, about fifty years early even given everything else.</p><p class="double">Still, she decided, watching the firey re-entry trail of <i>Celestia IV</i> as it brought home the year&#039;s first load of Helium-3, it was satisfying to see what Tropico could become with just a bit of outside assistance.</p><p class="double">Twilight sipped at her lime cordial with the satisfaction of a job well done.</p><p class="double"><i>Besides,</i> she thought with a smile, <i>it&#039;s better than the normal round of coups and revolutions any loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></i></p><p class="double">46.8 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was having trouble deciding what to do for this Summer Sun Celebration. Neither Luna nor Nyx was awake this time, and none of her usual ideas were appealing. The unicorn had blinked over to Ponyville to see if any of her friends had anything to try. Twilight was trotting down Ponyville&#039;s main street when she spotted an interesting conversation taking place over a plate of hay fries.</p><p class="double">&quot;Really? I&#039;ve always wondered what it was like underwater...&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy was...on a date? Okay, <i>that</i> was definitely new. The butter-yellow pegasus was sitting on the other side of the cafe table from a brown pegasus stallion with yellow hair.</p><p class="double">Before Twilight could get any sense of what was going on, Fluttershy spotted her and waved.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So he&#039;s a looper?&quot; Twilight asked Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">The pegasus&#039;s ears twitched. In response, Fluttershy looked abashed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...he would like me to remind you that he can hear you perfectly fine, even if he doesn&#039;t like to talk very much...if that&#039;s okay with you, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, sorry,&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">This was the strangest one-sided conversation she&#039;d ever been in. &#039;Doesn&#039;t talk much&#039;...seemed more like &#039;doesn&#039;t talk at all&#039; to her. At least Fluttershy could translate for her, otherwise Twilight would never have understood what Link was &#039;saying&#039;.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Nightmare Moon will be here in two minutes. Are you sure that&#039;s all you want to use?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Link nodded, his wings shuffling a little bit as he adjusted his grip on his extremely complicated-looking slingshot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...he said, &#039;You said she can teleport, right?&#039;,&quot; Fluttershy translated.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right,&quot; Twilight responded.</p><p class="double">Right on time, Nightmare Moon burst in through the curtains and began her speech. Just before she finished, the pegasus loaded a seed into his slingshot and fired it at Nightmare Moon. It landed on the stage between her forehooves and cracked.</p><p class="double">&quot;The night shall last...what? Wait! N-NOOOOOOoooooooo!&quot;</p><p class="double">A tornado erupted from inside the seed, tore a hole in the ceiling, and carried the screaming Nightmare Moon off into the distance. Less than five minutes later, she reappeared on the stage, disheveled and furious.</p><p class="double">&quot;It will take more than petty tricks to -&quot;</p><p class="double">This time the seed hit Nightmare Moon&#039;s helmet.</p><p class="double">Five minutes later, Nightmare Moon reappeared. There was a tree branch stuck in her ethereal mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;WHOEVER IS DOING THAT -&quot;</p><p class="double">...Ten minutes later, a very dizzy Nightmare Moon reappeared on stage, staggering like a drunk.</p><p class="double">&quot;We...WILL find you, whoever – ugh – whoever you are, and–&quot;</p><p class="double">This time <i>three</i> seeds hit Nightmare Moon. Twilight briefly went to check on the Mare in the Moon when she didn&#039;t come back and found Princess Luna, out cold, stuck in an apple tree in Appleloosa.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not bad,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;You said those were called Gale Seeds?&quot;</p><p class="double">Putting away his slingshot, Link stretched his wings out – revealing his cutie mark of three golden triangles – and nodded. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Which Link are you, anyway?&quot; Twilight asked, perusing her list of Hub fiction.</p><p class="double">Link gave an elaborate wing-shrug. Fluttershy went wide-eyed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my. That sounds terribly confusing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What did he say?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;He said &#039;Your guess is as good as mine. I&#039;ve been them all, and there&#039;s some reincarnation thing going on that doesn&#039;t help. Zelda tried to explain that part to me a few times but I don&#039;t really understand it.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Link waved a hoof, and Fluttershy dutifully added, &quot;&#039;But didn&#039;t you say something about a chaos monster appearing later today?&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right, Discord. He doesn&#039;t seem to be looping this time, but he makes it hard to tell for sure.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Huh. Okay, I think I have something that should work really...Fluttershy, you can stop now?&#039;...oh, sorry,&quot; Fluttershy said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord broke free of his stone prison. He stretched, idly turning the hedge maze into a wobbly pile of jello. Being stuck in one pose for a thousand years gave him such a crick in the neck!</p><p class="double">&quot;Finally! Time to spruce up this boring world with some of my patented <i>chaos!...</i>Eh?&quot;</p><p class="double">In front of him was a brown pegasus holding a bottle with a lit fuse attached. Without a word, the pegasus tossed the bottle to the ground just as it busted open with muffled BANG and a puff of soot. The soot fell to the ground, revealing...a chicken.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm,&quot; Discord said, studying the soot-covered chicken with a magnifying glass and ignoring the unholy look in its beady eyes, &quot;Is it Chicken Day already? How unexpected of Celestia to keep my national holidays!&quot;</p><p class="double">It took Discord another moment to realize the pegasus had taken off at a dead run. And then, crowing their wrath, the Cucco Horde descended.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Getting a Cucco into a bottle was hard.</p><p class="double">Attaching a small bomb to the bottle without angering the Cucco further was harder.</p><p class="double">Using the Cucco Horde Bomb on unsuspecting victims, Link thought to himself as he watched the carnage from several miles away, was <i>priceless.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.9 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Draco took a moment to consider his position. It was, on the whole, not very good.</p><p class="double">One: He was a travelling performer. Or rather, replacing a travelling performer. That meant no money and barely any reputation to use, which in turn meant actual work.</p><p class="double">Two: The nobility here was so... naive. There wasn&#039;t anything like blood purity or even a secret source of power. Equality was the name of the game, and that meant nothing he could do would convince the others of his inherent superiority.</p><p class="double">Three: The native anchor was angry at him and having him go through these... pointless morality lessons. Loyalty was of course something he already understood, though that rainbow pegasus had insisted that it was a &quot;two way street&quot;. Generosity and Kindness were supposed to be masks, not ideals. Honesty was simply idiotic, and laughter.... laughter was just too random to put into this already pathetic mishmash. Even magic wasn&#039;t properly represented, sounding more like Dumbledore&#039;s silly friendship nonsense then anything practical.</p><p class="double">Four: Twilight Sparkle had made it utterly clear that she or any of the other native loopers could easily make his life hell. That just wasn&#039;t fair. He was from the first five! These... ponies were damned upstarts!</p><p class="double">Which led right into the final point: He was a pony. Granted, one of the obviously superior unicorn race, but still. At least his coat was a lovely slytherin green.</p><p class="double">He did not see how this could get any worse. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Draco tromped up the library stairs, slamming the door to the gueest room open. A day of boring lectures, vile animals, tedious hard labor, inane prattle, veiled insults, and deranged giggles was over and done with. No doubt the next day would contain more of the... same...</p><p class="double">Something was stretched languidly on his bed, flicking its tattered tail idly as its mane dripped down its neck. It was very definitely female, and vaguely pony shaped, but covered in black chitin with holes in its long, slender legs. The creature was appraising him with half lidded cat eyes, its fangs gleaming in the moonlight. An eerie green glow surrounded the crooked shaft of its horn; Draco heard the door behind him swing shut.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am quite... put out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Draco Malfoy narrowed his eyes at the buzzing voice. &quot;Really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm, yes. You see, the entertainer you&#039;re replacing, she and I are... involved, shall we say.&quot; The creature slipped off the bed, cricking its neck idly. &quot;And of course I can... survive, without her. It&#039;s not too much of a problem. And yet... I find myself offended by the fact she was replaced by something as pathetic as you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Normally Draco would have shouted his own merits, but something about that statement held him back. He trotted idly round the outer edge of the room, eyes never leaving the strange beast. &quot;I apologize for my insult.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You do not mean that,&quot; the creature pointed out. &quot;It would be obvious to a non looping <i>foal</i> you did not mean that, and that is exactly why you have earned my ire. I have never visited Hogwarts, but from what I understand the house of Slytherin is supposed to be home to the cunning.&quot; She glowered at the unicorn as he moved. &quot;But you, you were sorted into that house because you were too cowardly for Gryiffindor, too stupid for Ravenclaw, and too lazy for Hufflepuff. You have no ambitions, no true cunning, and the only reason the Hat didn&#039;t expel you then and there was your connections which just barely qualified you to be in the house of snakes.&quot;</p><p class="double">He froze, his face controting in rage. &quot;...You dare to judge my worthiness? To say I have no place in Slytherin when you have never even visited--?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You have <i>no right--!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have every right, Draco Malfoy.&quot; The creature took a single step towards him. &quot;Every loop, I am in charge of a race that has to feed off of love.&quot; Another step was taken. &quot;I have to make sure my children are not starving, and to do that I have to earn the love of a non-looping populace.&quot; And another. &quot;Look at what I am, Draco. I am beautiful and hideous, and my children do not share my beauty.&quot; And another. &quot;And yet, every loop, my swarm survives. Not through force, but through crafty manipulations, through our ability to take other&#039;s forms and feel other&#039;s feelings, though coordination and sly tricks and never once has Equestria suspected a thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her breath was cold on his face. &quot;You were sorted into Slytherin, Draco Malfoy. I was <i>born</i> into it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The blonde unicorn took a moment to process the words. &quot;...then we have a common enemy in Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A true Slytherin has no enemies,&quot; the creature stated as she pulled back, &quot;or at least none worth naming. Enemies are for the brave Gryffindors to fight, for the intelligent Ravenclaws to outwit, for the persevering Hufflepuffs to endure. Any creature that would be an enemy to Slytherin is to be... subverted. The reason for its opposition removed. And if that is impossible, then ensure it will also fight one of the other houses. In the baseline of this world Twilight Sparkle has every reason to hate me and my children, but as an Anchor I have convinced her to allow my nation to thrive. That is the true power that Slytherin claims. And that is the power that I will instil into you.&quot;</p><p class="double">She smiled. It was not a kind smile. &quot;The elements are telling you what their traits are, how to embody them. I will teach you how to use them properly in the house of snakes. I will teach you how to be a harmonious Slytherin. And I <i>will</i> teach you this. You would try to deny me, but I can ensure you will suffer till the loop&#039;s end. So, Draco Mal–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AVADA KEDAVRA!&quot;</p><p class="double">The creature fell dead. Draco took a moment to catch his breath before breaking out in a wide grin. Ha, as if that thing could ever–</p><p class="double">With a long, dry creak, the door swung open. He turned to see the newcomer--and his jaw dropped in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did I forget to mention? My people have a hive mind.&quot; The thing smirked. &quot;It&#039;s not possible to kill me.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Draco Malfoy fainted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow as Chrysalis giggled and hopped down the stairs. &quot;I take it things went... decently?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve played the evil queen! I&#039;ve forgotten how fun it can be!&quot; The changeling waved a casual hoof, preemptively dismissing the librarian&#039;s concerns. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, I won&#039;t let it get to me. I promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll hold you to that.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.10 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight blinked Awake, looking up from her standard book of lore...</p><p class="double">...and coming face to face with three very human looking women. &quot;Oh. Did... I do something wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We don&#039;t know yet,&quot; Urd said, conjuring up a chair and sitting down. &quot;But you did come in contact with a Skaia protocol. That means you and every other looper involved in the session need to be debriefed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sleipnir&#039;s gathering your friends up,&quot; Belldandy added. &quot;He thought it might be better for the local admin to send out the call... That and, well, we don&#039;t blend in with the natives very well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. &quot;We&#039;re in a public park...&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld crossed her arms, glaring at her sisters. &quot;I told you we should have waited for her to get to the library. But noooooo, you two had to get to her as soon as possible--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you have anything from that loop in your subspace pocket?&quot; Urd demanded. &quot;Alchemically manufactured items, sylladexs, pumpkins, ectobiology devices, anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn sighed, reaching into her mane and pulling various things out. &quot;I assume that you&#039;re going to confiscate all of this anyway...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Belldandy reassured her as Skuld began sorting through the items. &quot;Anything that could cause Skaia-type alchemy or ectobiology to develop, yes. Anything that&#039;s a danger to the loop, yes. But everything else–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Safe!&quot; Skuld tossed a wand back to Twilight, who caught it and put it to her left. &quot;Could you double check and make sure no Grist got caught in there? That happens sometimes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure.&quot; Twilight tugged at the opening of her subspace pocket, peering down into it. &quot;I&#039;ve got to warn you, though, the others don&#039;t have theirs as organized as mine, so it might take a bit for them to find anything in their pockets...&quot; Various abstract forms were swept out into the open.</p><p class="double">Urd smiled a bit. &quot;You&#039;re being very helpful, I like that. Most of the time we get people who feel cheated that they didn&#039;t get to see the universe they created.&quot;</p><p class="double">That got the librarian&#039;s attention. &quot;Wait, the genesis frog worked? I thought that the loops would--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Skaia protocol is... something we haven&#039;t quite locked down,&quot; Belldandy admitted. &quot;We got all the programs that were <i>active</i> at the time of the crash looping, although we haven&#039;t activated any loopers in them. Too many potential malicious loop entities...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The fact is enough Skaia programs got shaken loose that they started drifting.&quot; Skuld shrugged. &quot;Most of the time they go for something near the Hub, but occasionally we&#039;ll get a seed out here. We lock em down as quick as we can find them, but we usually only find them after they&#039;ve generated a new branch.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head. &quot;Why a frog, though?&quot;</p><p class="double">Urd shrugged. &quot;The guy who programmed the protocol was... weird.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway,&quot; Skuld continued, &quot;it&#039;s now standard procedure to debrief all loopers who get caught up in the Skaia protocol, check any universe they created, and see if any other problems have arisen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like prototyping a first guardian?&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;I read Homestuck before this, and I tried to ensure nothing like that happened. Um, is the looping Skaia protocol--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. It&#039;s Homestuck.&quot; Belldandy shuddered. &quot;And now you know why we will never activate anyone in there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.11 (SpaceKGreen)</p><p class="double"></p><p>He sighed as he woke up unexpectedly. He hadn&#039;t been careful enough, and as he had learned, one mistake and you had to start all over.</p><p class="double">Taking stock of his surroundings, he noticed some oddities. Everything looked... smoother. His body felt weird. Maybe this was one of those–?</p><p class="double">Unfamiliar memories flowed into his mind. At the same time, senses formed over countless years screamed at him.</p><p class="double">One word stood out.</p><p class="double"><i>DIAMONDS.</p><p class="double"></i></p><p>Applejack and Twilight stood and stared at the odd sight in the orchard.</p><p class="double">A tree stood there. More accurately, part of a tree stood there; branches swayed merrily in the breeze, ignoring the fact that a large section of trunk was missing. Every now and then one of the branches would remember that gravity existed, falling to the ground.</p><p class="double">Nearby was a strange wooden box with various pieces of wood and apples strewn about it, and next to that was a strange hole leading deep into the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;d say it was a Diamond Dog, but...&quot; began Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, Diamond Dogs don&#039;t leave floating trees. Or dig perfectly square holes.&quot; Twilight racked her memories. &quot;Hold on...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shot her a questioning glance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember that one strange loop we were in a while back? Where everything was blocky?&quot; asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, Ah remember that one. Apple Bloom an&#039; the others were thrilled with it fer some reason, Sweetie Belle especially.&quot; Applejack&#039;s eyebrows shot up. &quot;Wait. Ah thought that place was one of them universes with no Anchors or home loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So did I.&quot; Twilight admitted. &quot;It didn&#039;t seem like it was, well, fleshed out enough to have a stable loop. I heard stories from other Anchors who ended up there, and nobody seemed to have the same experience.&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked up as the last branch realized that there wasn&#039;t anything holding it up and fell with a crash. &quot;Well, it seems that we have a new Looper on our hooves. And if their home loop is different every time,&quot; her eyes widened, &quot;they probably don&#039;t even know that they&#039;re looping. This will be an interesting explanation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack peered down the hole. &quot;If&#039;n we can find them.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.12 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was late in another lonely Loop, and Twilight had gotten sucked into the enchanted comic. Once again, Spike was demonstrating the greatest superpower of all: exposition.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re the Masked Matter-Horn!&quot; he told her. &quot;You can fire all kinds of crazy power beams out of your horn!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked. &quot;Really?&quot; She&#039;d done some research after her first trip here, using nonmagical comics. The Matter-Horn was actually a pegasus who&#039;d invented a sort of artificial horn, which explained why she&#039;d had so much trouble using it the first time around. Now, however, she knew how to properly use the bizarre blend of magic and technology this subdimension insisted on. A bit of focus, a subvocalized command, and a pale blue ray shot out of her horn at a decent fraction of the speed of light.</p><p class="double">It struck the Mane-iac, who blinked and looked around, clearly confused. Her mane went still, then gently lowered her onto her hooves. &quot;I…&quot; She looked at the Electro Orb in one of her tendrils like she&#039;d never seen it before. &quot;What&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">The ponies (and dragon) were promptly ejected from the comic.</p><p class="double">The others boggled at Twilight for a bit. Spike broke the silence. &quot;What did you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;All kinds of crazy power beams,&#039; right? Well, how hard could it be for the Masked Matter-Horn to fire a beam of sanity?&quot; Twilight nuzzled her number-one assistant. &quot;Couldn&#039;t have done it without you, Spike.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.13 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">&quot;Power ponies!&quot; The Mane-iac exclaimed, &quot;How kind of you to join us.&quot;</p><p class="double">The six ponies and one dragon started stripping off their costumes.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is this?&quot; The lunatic mare grinned, &quot;So intimidated by me that you&#039;re going to give up without a fight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really,&quot; called down Twilight. &quot;We just didn&#039;t want these costumes cramping our style.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mane-iac grabbed a cart and flung it at them, only to have it caught by a purple glow of energy and set down beside them.</p><p class="double">&quot;But... none of you has that power...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack jumped off the building they were on, and dropped to the street below, cracking the pavement as she landed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I reckon you need to be more... grounded.&quot; She slammed her fore-hooves into the ground and the pavement around Mane-iac exploded upwards to encase her up to her neck.</p><p class="double">Pinkie appeared from a trash can beside her. &quot;Heh he! Good one!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Since when could Mistress Mare-velous control stone!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The name&#039;s Applejack missy, and you ain&#039;t seen the half of what I can do!&quot;</p><p class="double">Mane-iac growled and started smashing away at the stone with her hair-strands.</p><p class="double">Rarity glided down, having grown a pair of wings. &quot;Dear me, your hair is completely unmanageable. Time for a make-over!&quot;</p><p class="double">A massive pair of blue translucent shears appeared out of nowhere and started trimming away Mane-iac&#039;s locks. &quot;Noooo! My locks are impervious to even your attack constructs, Radiance.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s Rarity, and this is tectonium, a little something I whipped up to comb a mane of pure force. Which yours isn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mane-iac was half bald by now, and completely enraged. Her hair was regrowing, but Rarity was trimming it faster. &quot;When I get the electro-orb to my secret weapon...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean this electro-orb?&quot; Pinkie appeared on the opposite side of the street, holding it in a hoof</p><p class="double">Mane-iac looked at what she was holding and found it was a cupcake. &quot;How... Give it to me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh uh, you meanie-pants, you didn&#039;t say the &#039;Pinkie says&#039;...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight landed in front of her, in full floating hair princess mode and casually flicking away thrown pieces of pavement. &quot;You see, we&#039;ve fought real villains...&quot;</p><p class="double">A lock of hair that had escaped Rarity&#039;s shears formed into a needle point and speared down at her, only to be trimmed by a rainbow shockwave that reverberated along the street.</p><p class="double">&quot;... Thanks Dash, real, world ending honest to gosh, deity level threats. By comparison, you aren&#039;t even a warm-up.&quot;</p><p class="double">All the ponies had gone full floaty mane alicorn, and were letting their auras show. Mane-iac, now bald, cringed. But it was Spike who dropped off Twilight&#039;s back and strode up to her.</p><p class="double">Mane-iac gave one final snort. &quot;Letting your useless sidekick Humdrum feel like he&#039;s useful? How <i>heroic.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Spike is plenty useful. It&#039;s amazing what one of his smiles can do to convince ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, as if!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike suddenly swelled up into a great ancient wyrm and lowered his head to her level, grinning to expose teeth bigger than she was. He rumbled, &quot;Care to reconsider?&quot;</p><p class="double">But Mane-iac had fainted. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">46.14 (Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon screamed as soon as she left her – once – friend&#039;s home. It wasn&#039;t frustration, it was several times her weight of airborne predator snatching her up in it&#039;s talons and bearing her skyward. The filly&#039;s scream dopplered as the pale griffin bore her up and dropped her on a convenient cloud. To her shock she didn&#039;t fall through.</p><p class="double">This phenomenon stopped her screaming, as she cautiously poked the strangely solid (for an Earth Pony) cloud. &quot;Why aren&#039;t I falling through?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin responded, revealing she was a female. &quot;I compacted it so it was solid enough to walk on without magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon rubbed her hooves on the cloud. &quot;Flyers can do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin&#039;s beak split in what might have been a smile. &quot;If you are sufficiently awesome, sure. But enough about me. This is about you getting over feeling bucked by your timing for Waking Up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sliver Spoon could hear the capitalization, and spat, &quot;A Looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin nodded, &quot;Yeah, and so are you. So do we do this the Pony way and talk about how stupid your snit is? Or the Griffin way?&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly cocked her head, &quot;What&#039;s the Griffin way?&quot;</p><p class="double">The smirk on the griffin grew, &quot;I tie both forelegs behind my back and wire my beak shut, hand you something <i>really</i> powerful to give you half a chance, then there is bruising, a bit of blood, and probably a high speed dirt dive for one or both of us. We bond over the recovery, then I explain how stupid your snit is.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon looked at the Griffin. The older flyer could obviously take her even before the Loops, and afterwards... even with only her hind paws and wings, and whatever that &#039;equalizer&#039; was, she didn&#039;t fancy her chances. And it surprised her how little she cared about that gap right now, after D- after Tiara...</p><p class="double">She shoved the feeling of betrayal aside. &quot;Why don&#039;t we try the Pony way for now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Griffin&#039;s smirk got even bigger, as if she noticed her way wasn&#039;t off the table yet. She waved her tail in an oddly precise pattern and a couple of cloud couches popped up. Silver Spoon gave the griffin a look as hers was a classic psychiatrists&#039; couch, but she hoped up on it. It was a measure of how weird her day was that the colour draining back into the griffin only merited a raised eyebrow. &quot;Aren&#039;t you the Chief Weather Mare&#039;s friend?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin nodded. &quot;Yep, name&#039;s Gilda. So want to talk about why your friend looked like she just took a gut shot down there?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon didn&#039;t know why, but she just exploded. &quot;That isn&#039;t my friend! I don&#039;t know who she is! I knew Diamond Tiara, but that pony that replaced her is a stranger! YOU CAN&#039;T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT FE-&quot;.</p><p class="double">The rant was cut off suddenly. Silver Spoon hadn&#039;t seen the griffin move. Gilda was just suddenly THERE. One set of talons was clamping her muzzle shut, the other cradled the back of her skull. Silver Spoon also noticed that the griffin had gone all pale again, and the look in her eye said it would be easy to snap the filly&#039;s neck, crush her skull, or if feeling merciful just break her jaw.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are a new looper, so I&#039;ll let a lot go in the wind. But not finishing that sentence, understand?&quot; Taking the abortive nod as understanding Gilda steered the filly around to another view off the cloud. The pair were now looking over Sweet Apple Acres. &quot;A little visual aid here to show where things stand, and how much stupid nearly came out of your mouth.&quot; She pointed to the reservoir pond for the irrigation system. &quot;That pond? That&#039;s Twilight Sparkle&#039;s status as an Anchor. The mare needs to lose weight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon surprised herself at the semi-hysterical giggle at the snide remark. Gilda continued, &quot;Each tree is someone in Equestria. Get enough water from Lake Twilight and you start looping.&quot; A talon pointed at the Zap Apple orchard, the largest and oldest trees on the farm. Gilda started naming them, &quot;Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, Spike, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash. My best friend.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ignoring Silver Spoon&#039;s squeak Gilda continued pointing at trees, moving out to younger and less water hungry varieties, still naming them. &quot;Princess Celestia. Princess Luna. Twilight&#039;s brother Shining Armor. Princess Cadence, her sister-in-law. Applebloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo. I&#039;m about there and Tiara is right next to me.&quot; The talon finally pointed to a row of freshly planted saplings &quot;And you are right there. I figure the gap between me and Dashie is larger than you and Tiara.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon hardly noticed Gilda letting go, or the colour flowing back into her again as the filly flopped to the cloud. &quot;How do you ever catch up?&quot; she asked in despair.</p><p class="double">Gilda shook her head, &quot;It ain&#039;t a question of catching up chick. Let me guess, you feel like your buddy left you behind?&quot; At Silver Spoon&#039;s nod the griffin sighed, &quot;Brutal Honesty is my schtick. So here it is. One of the curses of Looping is feeling like you are leaving everyone you care about who isn&#039;t Looping behind. The feeling sucks worse than a downdraft. We hope our friends join us, and fear them doing so for how experiencing that will make them feel. You&#039;ll get it quick, because...&quot; Gilda pulled an apple from, somewhere, and bit deep into it. The bite nicked the core, exposing some apple seeds. &quot;Remember when I was pointed out trees?&quot; The griffin pointed to two seeds, &quot;These are your parents.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon&#039;s stomach dropped. &quot;Wait, if I&#039;m looping now, how long till Mom and Dad start?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda shook her head, &quot;It&#039;s not something even Twilight can put a number on. But from what I understand, your Looping is practically Divine Intervention. Sequoia willing things will be fixed before Twilight gets big enough for your parents to get watered.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon choked back a sob, &quot;How did you and Miss Dash deal with the gap?&quot;</p><p class="double">The griffin put a talon gently under the crying filly&#039;s chin and gave her a lopsided grin. &quot;Badly. Ran off for a few loops with Trixie and had interesting adventures trying to establish myself as a looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon had to ask. &quot;How &#039;interesting&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda chuckled. &quot;Oh Oak, oh Ash, we are all going to die.&quot; She gave another grin. &quot;I will tell you this though. No matter how busy she got. No matter how urgent the crisis. No matter how frustrated you made her at not being able to change? Every time the two of us were Awake and some version of you was in town, I always saw Diamond Tiara making time for her.&quot; </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<br /><p class="double">47.1 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash yawned and stretched out her wings. She&#039;d Awoken into a wintry world, though what could be seen through the blizzard seemed awfully familiar. For some reason her loop self had been sleeping in a tree instead of on a cloud.</p><p class="double">She got a funny reading when Dash checked the Element of Loyalty. Only Twilight was Awake, except...not here yet? That was different...hadn&#039;t Twilight mentioned a few loops where Celestia or Luna had Awoken way before Twilight had entered the loop? Cool.</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess I&#039;ll take a look around. Where am I anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Not far away was a miserable-looking village. Vaguely familiar, but Dash couldn&#039;t place it. Dash could see it was full of Earth Ponies, all of whom were struggling to work their farms, but with the sheer volume of snow coming down that was impossible. All their crops were looking more like ice sculptures in the snow. She snorted: somepony had scheduled a blizzard over this town right in the middle of summer!</p><p class="double">Well, Dash would soon fix <i>that</i>.</p><p class="double">It was filly&#039;s play for Dash to corral the storm into one spot. Feeling the eyes of the village on her, Dash couldn&#039;t resist showing off – she tore into the heart of the storm, and unleashed a Sonic Rainboom to blast it apart! She made a big show about hunting down the last clouds before coming in for a landing in the middle of the village. Most of the ponies were looking at her like she was a Timber Wolf, but one mare stepped forward cautiously after a minute.</p><p class="double">&quot;You...got rid of the snow?&quot; the mare asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course I did!&quot; Dash replied, &quot;You guys needed the help. I&#039;d never leave ponies hanging.&quot;</p><p class="double">The other ponies started whispering amongst themselves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...none of the other pegasus ponies ever bother with moving the snow. Not without demanding half our crops first,&quot; the mare said.</p><p class="double">Now that it was sunny, Dash was able to see the town a lot more clearly. And she could recognize why it looked so familiar: it was right out of that Heart&#039;s Warming Eve play they&#039;d put on in Canterlot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Dash said, &quot;Well, you know what I think about <i>that?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And then they made you their leader?&quot; Twilight blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot;</p><p class="double">As soon as Twilight had Awoken, she&#039;d realized something was up. Dash had appeared not long after and explained the whole thing, but Twilight was still confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Even though you weren&#039;t an Earth Pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! It confused the <i>frond</i> out of Platinum and Hurricane at the Summit,&quot; Dash grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;And is that related to why Equestria is...not in Equestria?&quot; Twilight added, waving a hoof at the unfamiliar landscape surrounding them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, that was Cookie&#039;s idea. I just kept the skies clear, she did all the hard parts. S&#039;why I abdicated the position of &#039;Most Awesome Boss of Earth Ponies&#039; to her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;By abdicated, you mean &#039;snuck off, Ascended, and had a thousand-year-nap&#039;, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Same thing!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings everypony, and welcome to Loops 101. Now then....&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle picked up a piece of chalk, glanced at the chalkboard, and smiled. A moment later, both went sailing away; the unicorn pulled a small metal disc out of thin air and tossed it to the ground, tapping it briefly, and suddenly there was a strange see-through bush-tree hovering and slowly rotating in front of the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;Most of you have already got the basic story from me or my friends, so this will be more a question and answer session than an actual lecture. So, recap: We&#039;re stuck in a time loop because the multiverse is broken and the people in charge don&#039;t want it to break any further while they&#039;re fixing problems.&quot; She flicked her hoof and the image changed to a simple line, with a picture of the moon on the left and a purple alicorn silhouette on the right. &quot;The loop we&#039;re in generally starts right before the Summer Sun celebration and it used to end around the time of my coronation, but recently enough damage was fixed that it&#039;s started to expand out beyond that by about a week every five hundred loops or so.&quot;</p><p class="double">With another gesture, Twilight generated a number of parallel lines, some shorter then the marked Equestria line but most far longer. &quot;Loops in other universes can range anywhere from a year to &#039;whenever everyone dies&#039; in length. If you&#039;re Awake, check your loop memories <i>as soon as possible</i> and try to discretely find the local anchor and other loopers while retaining as much of your pre-awake self as you deem appropriate. You&#039;re each going to be partnered up with a Looper you knew in the baseline to guide you through this loop, but there&#039;s no guarantee that they&#039;ll be Awake in your next loop or that you&#039;ll even be in Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to Spike, standing off to the side. &quot;How was that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually pretty good. You managed to keep your rambling down to ten minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh ha ha ha.&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes, then turned back to the group with a smile. &quot;Equestria&#039;s been declared a sanctuary loop for anybody that ends up here, a respite in all the insanity of the multiverse. Of course, we can&#039;t help others if we don&#039;t look after our own; if you ever need anything, just ask! And speaking of asking, now is the perfect time for any questions you might have.&quot;</p><p class="double">Instantly there was a flurry of raised hooves.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Twilight, I&#039;m pretty sure one of the Trek Anchors was here last loop,&quot; Fluttershy said softly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; The unicorn shelved a final book and turned around with a big grin. &quot;Did you get any evidence?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no, sorry... I was, um, too busy dealing with the new expansion period.&quot; The pegasus waved a hoof. &quot;You weren&#039;t Awake and I was curious how you&#039;d deal with that bat infestation in the baseline, so I went for a vanilla handling of things.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded with a sigh. &quot;I guess I can&#039;t blame you. I&#039;d be curious too. What ended up happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you turned me into a vampire.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....<i>what.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.4</p><p class="double">Twilight cleared her throat, just as Nightmare Moon finished her &#039;night will last forever&#039; speech. “Er-hem?”</p><p class="double">Nightmare turned. “Yes, my new subject?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn held up her old soft toy. “Smarty Pants doesn&#039;t like you.”</p><p class="double">“...is that some kind of foal&#039;s toy?” Nightmare Moon asked, glaring down at it. Then she tossed her head. “And why should I care? Answer soon, or your insolence will be punished.”</p><p class="double">Twilight hovered Smarty Pants over to her ear, and moved it in little jerks. “What&#039;s that, Smarty Pants? You think she should be nicer to you?” Lowering the toy, Twilight shrugged. “Well, you heard her.”</p><p class="double">“Are you soft in the head?” Nightmare asked incredulously. (Several of the ponies in the audience were nursing the same suspicions.)</p><p class="double">More pantomiming.</p><p class="double">“Smarty Pants thinks you should apologize.”</p><p class="double">“Twi, are you alright?” Spike asked quietly.</p><p class="double">“Me?” Twilight nodded. “I&#039;m fine. It&#039;s Smarty Pants who&#039;s taunting the dark goddess-”</p><p class="double">Twilight broke off, and consulted Smarty Pants again. “Oh, I see. You can take her? Go ahead, then.”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s horn glow vanished, and a green witchfire instead spread over Smarty Pants. The toy&#039;s eyes began to glow in several colours.</p><p class="double">“What is this?” Nightmare Moon asked, backing unconsciously. “Stop it!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not doing anything,” Twilight protested. “Smarty is, though, and she doesn&#039;t like you.”</p><p class="double">The toy turned to Twilight. Nightmare lashed out with a spell, which crashed into the green aura and vanished. The toy turned back to her for a moment, then faced Twilight and wiggled for a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“Smarty Pants is very cross,” Twilight announced.</p><p class="double">Smarty faced Nightmare Moon, and fired a beam of rainbow light.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. “Best prank in a hundred years!”</p><p class="double">Admittedly, shrinking the Rainbow of Light from the Gen 1 Loop down so it would fit inside Smarty Pants had been tricky. But the payoff was hilarious.</p><p class="double">Especially since, at Twilight&#039;s calm insistence, the stuffed toy had been the one honoured for defeating Nightmare Moon. (She&#039;d explained that the lack of movement was because Smarty Pants was tired. Celestia had just looked confused.)</p><p class="double">“Now, dealing with Discord should be interesting...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon looked around, slowly at first but then with increasing confusion. “Where am I? This isn&#039;t my bedroom!”</p><p class="double">A clanking sound issued from behind her.</p><p class="double">“Oh, great,” came a voice she recognized as that of Twilight Sparkle. “Hold on, I think I know where we are.”</p><p class="double">Silver turned, nearly tripping as two of her legs felt strangely numb, only to come face to face with...</p><p class="double">A mechanical pony. A unicorn, actually. And so much larger than her that she felt she was standing next to one of the Princesses.</p><p class="double">The riveted-steel construction face-hoofed with a clang, and sighed. “Sorry, I&#039;m not doing this right. You&#039;re Silver Spoon, aren&#039;t you?”</p><p class="double">“Y-yeah,” Silver stammered. “Where am I?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m going to need to check – I <i>hate</i> loops where I&#039;m made of metal – but I&#039;m fairly sure that we&#039;re in the world of Full Metal Alchemist.”</p><p class="double">Silver blinked. “I understood maybe four of those words.”</p><p class="double">Twilight crouched down, bringing her closer to Silver&#039;s height. “This is one of those things I called a Fused Loop. In this case, we&#039;re in the place of the main loopers of another world – think of it like we&#039;re the main characters of a story.”</p><p class="double">Reaching into... nowhere in particular, she produced a set of books and slapped them down on the sand. “We&#039;ve got a couple of days before we need to be anywhere in particular, so we can get you properly accustomed to the situation.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t understand,” Silver said weakly.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry, you will.” Twilight&#039;s metal mouth creaked in what was probably a smile. “Oh, you might have heard us mentioning loop memories before? Try to let them do the thinking for your first time, it&#039;ll be easier.”</p><p class="double">Silver gulped, and tried to remember them talking about that. It was... strange.</p><p class="double">There were her <i>real</i> memories, the ones she was used to having, with her family and her friends in Equestria... and the strange, still-new experience of time looping.</p><p class="double">And then there was a whole new set of memories. Where she was a young filly, learning the ways of Alchemy, and...</p><p class="double">She gasped, looking down at her numb-feeling legs. As she&#039;d abruptly realized, they were artificial.</p><p class="double">Then she looked at Twilight. “Are... are we sisters? Here, I mean?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right.” Twilight nodded. “I&#039;m actually the younger sister, or supposed to be. And...” she stopped. “I&#039;m sorry, by the way. It looks like the script took your mother as the template instead of mine.”</p><p class="double">Tears started in Silver&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">“I know this must all be overwhelming,” Twilight said gently. “Some Anchors wouldn&#039;t be pleasant, it&#039;s true – they&#039;re from worlds less nice than Equestria, and their attitude to others can be a bit sink-or-swim. But I promise you, I&#039;ll only stand back unless you <i>want</i> my help. The moment you say so, this becomes about keeping you safe.”</p><p class="double">Silver sniffed. “Thanks. I&#039;ll...” she paused, and remembered that conversation with Gilda.</p><p class="double"><i>Let me guess, you feel like your buddy left you behind?</i></p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll give it a go.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the spirit.” Twilight nodded to her. “Again, though, if you need help then just ask.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You must be the Silver Alchemist!” a hassled-looking unicorn said to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “No, I&#039;m her sister. That&#039;s the Silver Alchemist.”</p><p class="double">“What am I, invisible or something?” Silver grumbled.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I didn&#039;t see you down there, squirt,” the unicorn apologized.</p><p class="double">Silver exhaled hard. “Is the short jokes thing going to <i>keep</i> happening?”</p><p class="double">“All signs point to yes, I&#039;m afraid,” Twilight said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right.” Silver winced at the damage to her remaining foreleg, which was coming close to laming her, and let the increasingly familiar local experiences help her ride out the pain. “Twilight? Quick question?”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">“Just so I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve got this whole thing worked out, &#039;cause I&#039;m <i>totally</i> confused... that&#039;s a bad guy, right?” She pointed at the approaching form of Fuhrer King Bradley. (He actually looked a lot like Sombra.)</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“Right,” Silver repeated. “Thanks for the science lessons, by the way.” She lifted her forehooves and clapped them on the ground, making a quick Alchemical circle.</p><p class="double">A pair of silver rods appeared next to one another on the long slope towards ground level, growing out of the ground.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d you get the silver?” Twilight asked, interested.</p><p class="double">“This palace had coins in it,” Silver said by way of explanation. “Emphasis on <i>had.</i>” A gold lozenge extruded from the ground next to her. “Okay, here we go.”</p><p class="double">She lifted the lozenge bodily onto the upper end of the pair of rods, then clapped her hooves on the ground again just as King Bradley reached the base of the ramp.</p><p class="double">Electricity sparked, the air tore, and when the sound died away there was a huge crater field at the base of the ramp.</p><p class="double">Of King Bradley there was no sign.</p><p class="double">Silver&#039;s smile was surprisingly feral. “Take that!”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Cool. Railgun, eh?”</p><p class="double">“Yep. It split into lots of bits as it left the rails, so he couldn&#039;t dodge.” Silver blushed slightly. “I may have paid a little more attention to the lessons about silver, and I remembered the thing about it having great conductivity-”</p><p class="double">“The best,” Twilight agreed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Father slammed Silver into the ground, making her head spin, and then smashed her artificial foreleg.</p><p class="double">Silver focused woozily, and realized what was going on. Hohenheim was about to sacrifice herself, and she didn&#039;t have an option of how to get out...</p><p class="double">“Twilight?” she croaked. “Now, please.”</p><p class="double">A bolt of lambent force the size of a tree hit Father and sent him slamming against the far wall.</p><p class="double">“Good work, by the way,” Twilight whispered, helping her up. “You made it as far as the original did.”</p><p class="double">“I feel so special.” Silver winced, moving her stump. “Ow, that does <i>not</i> feel right...”</p><p class="double">Twilight faced Father, her Device building up another spell. “I&#039;ll handle him from now on.

I&#039;m not stupid.”</p><p class="double">“Heh.” Gilda paced in a slow circle around Silver, taking in the change in posture. “Looks like you&#039;re living up to that cutie mark after all.”</p><p class="double">Silver blinked, thrown. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Look, if there&#039;s one thing the loops teach you ponies, it&#039;s that those tattoos you have on your butts are seriously hard to interpret. So, a silver spoon.” Gilda tapped the underside of her beak. “First meaning: you were born into money and privilege. Second meaning: It&#039;s still the most mundane of eating utensils, everyone uses them, so even if yours is silver it&#039;s just a more valuable version of a normal kind of thing. Third meaning: there&#039;s a heart in the design, so you do have a good heart in there. Fourth meaning: silver is antiseptic, so it cures illnesses. Fifth meaning: silver tarnishes, but yours is mirror-bright – so you keep yourself in shape.”</p><p class="double">The gryphon scratched. “So, yeah. There&#039;s probably more, but that&#039;s enough to be getting on with.”</p><p class="double">Silver nodded. “I see. I think.”</p><p class="double">Gilda cricked her neck. “Now, where&#039;s that rope...”</p><p class="double">Seeing Silver looking apprehensive, she grinned. “No getting out of it now.

Ever since the loops had expanded to include the vampire fruit bats, something weird was always going on at the orchards. Of course, they had never found anything, and Fluttershy swore up and down that she couldn&#039;t find anything with any of her senses, including her druidic ones. &quot;Applejack, there is a perfectly rational explanation for whatever is going on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rational Mah FLANK!&quot; Applejack swung her rump around to wriggle her cutie marks beneath Twilight&#039;s muzzle rather uncomfortably close. With the poor, shrivelled apples (what!?) in sight, she could see two tiny fang-holes punctured into Applejack&#039;s hide on both sides, which still dripped with cider. &quot;Whatever it was sucked the juice right outta mah cutie mark!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, so whatever it is is Pinkie-Rational. Right.&quot; A disturbing thought danced across Twilight&#039;s mind. &quot;And Dash likes to joke about how she replaced her blood with Zap Apple Cider a couple of thousand loops ago.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s eyes widened with a speed rivalling the ejecta shell of a supernova as her pupils constricted to pinprick singularities of horrified realization. &quot;Whatever got mah cutie marks is gonna get her!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s- what the chlorophyll is that noise?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; An almighty crash rocked the library as Dash plowed through an upstairs window at roughly the speed of sound and proceed to halfway embed herself in the floor. &quot;You guys have to help me! She vants to suck my blood!&quot;</p><p class="double">Tiny scrabbles of hooves clip-clattered against the upstairs balcony disturbingly lightly as the light coming through the window was filtered through a pair of yellow membranes. Silhouetted against the rising sun, the figure was partially shrouded by her own shadow as Twilight squinted into the light. The gleam of a pair of fangs glistened within a salivating maw beneath a pair of dully glowing blue eyes. Fluffy ears twitched at the strangled noises of inarticulate frustration coming from Twilight as her horn glowed with arcane energy.</p><p class="double">Then the sun was forcibly moved through the skies as Twilight ascended herself, revealing Fluttershy standing there with a disturbingly familiar new set of favoured mutations.</p><p class="double">Having the graces to look ashamed of herself, Fluttershy squeakily smiled as she folded her leathery wings and hopped down to the ground floor. Her breath hitched as she saw how Dash had buried herself in the floor. &quot;Oh! Oh my goodness! Oh, Rainbow Dash, are you alright!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Waaaaaaaaugh! Don&#039;t let her suck my blood! I don&#039;t wanna hang upside down and speak in a Roamanian accent!&quot; Dash thrashed as she tried to dig through the floorboards the rest of the way and make for the planet&#039;s core.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Dashie...&quot; Fluttershy caressed Dash&#039;s wings and sides with a hoof as she started to pull her free. Saliva dripped from her fangs as she nuzzled Dash disturbingly. &quot;I only want to show you how much I&#039;ve learned about the glories of freshly squeezed cider.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy, this has gone on long enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What Ah said!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy let go of Dash, leaving her stuck in the floor. &quot;Oh, whatever do you mean, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Intervention!&quot; Twilight&#039;s magic aura grabbed Fluttershy, bodily lifting her from the ground and carting her through the air to the door. &quot;And I know just who to do it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack started to follow Fluttershy and Twilight, stopping at the door as an urge struck her. She turned back to Dash, who was still wriggling in place, perfectly helpless and juicy.... &quot;Why Dash, Ah never thought Ah&#039;d get a chance like this...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AJ? Could you get Twilight to get me out of here? I really don&#039;t want to ascend and all just to get out of her floor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight ain&#039;t here no more, mah little Zap Apple...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh oh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fer that matter, neither is Applejack.

Me and mah big mouth.&quot; Applejack frowned as she pondered it over. That Fluttershy out of all the ponies in the world had come up with a crazy idea for a prank was certainly an odd one. She bunched her hindquarters as she felt the painful tingles from the bites still. Her druidic friend had developed a ritual to pass along her whole &#039;Vampire of the Fruits&#039; nature for a loop – some adaptation of a family of spells about &#039;bite of the were-something&#039; – but she was starting to wonder if the shy gal had a kinky side to her. Did she really have to bite both of her cutie marks?</p><p class="double">Applejack shook her head, feeling funny as her ears popped into their temporary new forms and as her cutie mark temporarily morphed into a trio of apple-colored bats. &quot;Ah am NEVER saying &#039;bite me&#039; around that gal again. Whoooiiee!

Zis iz avout <i>you.</i>&quot; She twitched her big bushy mustache and peered over her thick-rimmed glasses. &quot;Now zen... vy?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus sighed, leaning back into the couch. &quot;Well... I suppose it all comes back to kindness really. See, it&#039;s easy to be polite, and generosity is... something that&#039;s fairly simple to teach. But with kindness, you have to have empathy. You have to understand the person you&#039;re being kind to, help them on... something like their level. So... I guess I sometimes get carried away in understanding and let myself become.... other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. Und ze bat zing, zat started as un kindness and vecame.... addiction?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...maybe just a tad,&quot; Fluttershy admitted. &quot;I guess I&#039;ll try to hold back a bit... from now on.

It was another Oerth Loop, but the adventuring races were the setting&#039;s usual humanoids, and she wasn&#039;t one of them. Instead, she was a local unicorn: leonine tail, cloven hooves, the whole package. Oh, and none of the trappings of civilization whatsoever.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t so bad. With the perspective of a Loop Anchor, Twilight saw it as something like a camping trip. In any case, she had more than enough stored in her subspace pocket to keep herself entertained for years, from books to experiments to supplies for making magical items. And she could always find a party of adventurers to tag along with should the mood strike her. This was Oerth, after all; they were everywhere.</p><p class="double">She was scribing a scroll for what this world&#039;s mages would probably call <i>transmute into orange</i> when the sound of wingbeats came from above.

You should try to enjoy it and is that an egg?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s why I came.&quot; Dash did in fact have a roughly watermelon-sized egg cradled in her front legs, its shell just as blue. She set it down on the ground with surprising care. &quot;I, uh, I kinda…&quot; She trailed off into inaudible, almost Fluttershy-esque muttering.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s mind had already formed a hypothesis. She pulled a PADD out of subspace, grabbed it with telekinesis, and called up the 3.5 <i>Monster Manual</i>. She confirmed her guess in moments, and immediately wished that she hadn&#039;t. &quot;Mother of mahogany. You—&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash sneered. &quot;Yeah. Like I said, these bodies suck. I didn&#039;t even do anything!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s unfertilized?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am so glad it&#039;s just you and me this Loop. Can we please keep this between us? Pinkie, Gilda, Rarity, none of &#039;em would ever let me live this down. And I do <i>not</i> want to try and explain this to Scootaloo.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, Dash.&quot; Twilight retrieved some bubble wrap, wrapped the egg, and whisked it into her subspace pocket. She&#039;d put more thorough protections on it after the visit. &quot;Your secret is safe with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash sagged with relief. &quot;Thanks, Twi. You&#039;re a real pal. And, uh… take care of it, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course.&quot; Twilight silently scrapped the more invasive experiments that could be performed on a single cell of that size. Well, unless she acquired other pegasus eggs. Surely her friend wasn&#039;t the only member of the species that laid infertile eggs. The same environmental triggers would have applied to all local populations…</p><p class="double">&quot;Wish I could just ascend,&quot; Dash sighed. &quot;That&#039;d probably take care of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">That shook Twilight out of her thoughts of specimen acquisition. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, Rainbow, but we&#039;ve been over this. We don&#039;t know how the local gods would react. They might see it as a challenge.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But that&#039;s a bunch of horseapples!&quot; Dash flared her wings. &quot;We&#039;re not <i>that</i> powerful, and it&#039;s not like I&#039;m gonna grab the sun or moon or anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight couldn&#039;t really shrug, so she tossed her mane. &quot;Well, find a cleric and take it up with them.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus glared and pawed at the sod. &quot;Maybe I will. I am <i>not</i> forcing another one of those monstrosities out of me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, that isn&#039;t what I—&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash flapped off. &quot;Thanks again, Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn groaned. &quot;Why do I even speak?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.13 (Grinnerz)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“- and I must reiterate, the sandwich was clearly labelled with my name.

There were a few differences, like the funny plume on top of the statue&#039;s head, the apple motif on the armor, and the being made of solid rock thing. It was also the size of Town Hall in Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;One down, thirty-sommat to go...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, um...three of my armies in the Everfree Forest would like to attack your armies of Canterlot...if you don&#039;t mind,&quot; Fluttershy said, holding up three red dice.</p><p class="double">Rarity beamed, lifting up two white dice. &quot;Bring. It. On!&quot;</p><p class="double">The denizens of Canterlot watched in awe as the distant forms of three giant pony soldiers made of trees and two giant pony soldiers made of ice (and wearing fabulous capes of solidified water) did battle over the giant line of paint that had appeared the other day.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, we don&#039;t even HAVE an Australia, how did you even do that?!&quot; Rainbow Dash groaned as the party pony&#039;s giant candy-cane wielding marshmallow soldiers rampaged all over her own giant thunderbolt-using cloud armies from out of nowhere.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dashie, hiding in Australia until you steamroll the competition is TRADITION! Silly!&quot; Pinkie Pie giggled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Five!&quot; Applejack declared triumphantly.</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed to her die.</p><p class="double">&quot;Six...oh, crabapples. That&#039;s my last army.&quot;</p><p class="double">A mile away, the last of Applejack&#039;s stone soldiers crumbled as Twilight&#039;s magical construct soldier blasted it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hooray! Now it&#039;s between me, Twilight, and Rarity!&quot; Pinkie exclaimed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The rest of the Mane Six watched politely as Rarity was crowned Queen of the World by a very confused Celestia and Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;know, that was pretty fun,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, &quot;Whose turn is it to pick the next board game?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mine,&quot; Applejack said, looking over their list of games and crossing &#039;Risk&#039; off it, &quot;Let&#039;s see, what&#039;s left...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.15 (Detective Ethan Redfield):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>The Great Equestrian Foam Sword War, Part 2</b></p><p class="double">Gray wisps of smoke escaped the train as it ejected the travellers from Ponyville into Canterlot. Mayor Mare stared at the golden towers that rose into the air, a strange mix of joy and relief filled her heart at seeing the heart of Equestria once again. Even with the sun below the mountains, magical beacons and candlelight made the city gleam like the sun. The next couple days would hold numerous shopping trips and dining like the princesses at some of their finest restaurants as the Mayor and her friends and family arrived. Then, they would board a dirigible for a trip around the world in 90 days. These travel plans swirled through the Mayor&#039;s head as she made her way to a well kept but modest hotel. Celestia and Luna spent the previous day giving suggestions about where to travel and what to do abroad. It was the vacation of a lifetime and anyone would be excited.</p><p class="double">Looking at her now, though, no one could tell she was excited, as she looked from her room window to where Ponyville rested a few hours away. Although new to the loops, she had spent about twenty loops as Mayor of Ponyville, one in Metropolis and one in Townsville. She couldn&#039;t even remember her last vacation, worried as she was that without her there, her town/city would fall into ruin. But with Twilight&#039;s promise to protect Ponyville, she knew everything would turn out alright.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Big Mac&#039;s Bar</b></p><p class="double">&quot;So...how many of Miss Lulamoon&#039;s laboratories has she gone through tryin&#039; to make a foam sword grenade,&quot; Big Mac asked as he slid another cup of cider her way. With a single slurp, the cider was gone instantly. Twilight slammed her head down and muttered through the counter. Mac tilted his head and said, &quot;Sorry, Miss Sparkle, I could&#039;a sworn you said five.&quot;</p><p class="double">The element of magic nodded her head. The Anchor had decided to sit the war out, determined to make sure Ponyville was standing when the Mayor returned. She resolved to keep a close eye on Trixie in the month leading up to the war.</p><p class="double">Several seconds of silence passed as Mac looked over Trixie&#039;s scroll again, &quot;Say, did ya&#039; even agree ta&#039; the terms a&#039; this competition?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight lifted her head up, &quot;She pinkie promised that if I followed through with its terms, She&#039;d never use explosives of any kind for the next ten loops we&#039;re together in. I&#039;m curious to see how long she lasts.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac chuckled to himself. He held no interest in the war beyond keeping everypony safe. Applebloom and all the crusaders, however, were back at the farm setting up a new geofront running from the furthest corner of Ponyville to the edge of Everfree.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Sweet Apple Acre&#039;s Geofront</b></p><p class="double">Applebloom brought down the lever as several pieces of high tech machinery whirled around her. The sound of several high caliber rounds being fired over at the firing range echoed across the geofront. She looked to where Sweetie Belle was testing weapons modifications, &quot;How are the runes coming for the .408 cal rounds?&quot;</p><p class="double">Another crack echoed down the massive Geofront accompanied by a burst of white light. Her radio squawked back, &quot;It&#039;s working. I&#039;ve tested several magazines already, no errors. We&#039;ll need to have Twilight inspect them first, but it should prove effective from a great distance. Should work with the missiles and other caliber rounds as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom nodded to herself as new plans formed in her head. She&#039;d have Twilight check her design, then a prototype machine that churned out thousands of rounds and foam swords, and then if testing works, we can shift into mass production. With that set up, she made for Nyx and Scoots&#039; project. They probably had all kinds of modifications she wanted to make to their vehicles, which would consume quite a bit of her other time. After that, she would have to work on her own last resort project.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">What he heard, though, weren&#039;t terms he had heard in the equestrian military, but they still sounded something out of a strategy meeting during his times in the army. Their loops in futuristic and human militaries lead to terms like &quot;fixed weapon emplacements&quot; and &quot;long distance firing positions&quot; being passed around in anticipation of the &#039;war&#039; ahead. He resolved to take them on a vacation loop after the &#039;war&#039; ended.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what have ya heard from the other loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight lifted his head, &quot;Rainbow is practising some high speed fight manoeuvres over the ocean-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Somewhere over the Ocean</b></p><p class="double">A flash of rainbow split the ocean. A moment later, a glowing rainbow maned pony appeared over land on one side of the watery expanse. She looked down at the stopwatch in her hand. Ten seconds to cross the ocean. &#039;I can be faster than this,&#039; She thought to herself and disappeared with a rainbow explosion of energy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Gilda, upon learning about the competition, returned to the Griffin Empire to make preparations of some sort-&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>The Capital of the Griffon Empire</b></p><p class="double">The Ebony Palace standing at the top of the deepest canyon on the planet was home to the mighty griffon emperor, Aepnet. At its centre, the iron throne rested at the top of several stairs. One female griffon stood at the bottom of the stairs, surrounded by two squads of ten griffon soldiers that lay bleeding on the ground. The emperor and his aides resided at the top, looking down upon Gilda as she ascended the stairs, &quot;Emperor Aepnet, by right of succession, I, Gilda Grizelda, daughter of Dutchess Tyra Grizelda and 17th in line to the imperial throne, have come to end your reign and establish myself as Emperess of the Griffon Empire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Aepnet was no amateur though. He gazed upon her, noting a confidence he had never seen in his niece before, &quot;As honour dictates, I must accept, but implore you to back down. This will be to the death. Or has your time amongst the ponies at your flight camp made you weak?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda lifted her claw, steeling her emotions, &quot;No. A wise creature told me that only the truly strong can afford kindness, and I will make you submit before I have to kill you. Come at me, uncle!&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, the two griffons leapt at each other.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Lemon Rush is around this time, so Fluttershy&#039;s going to participate with him on a team-&quot;</p><p class="double">The sound of gears churning, wood crunching and ponies screaming could be heard from the basement of Sugarcube Corner where Mac had set up this time around to be more easily accessible to the loopers.</p><p class="double">Twilight buried her face in her hooves, &quot;Oh Chlorophyll, I think that&#039;s her now.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Ponyville</b></p><p class="double">The sound of severe rumbling could be heard throughout ponyville as ponies ran in terror of the approaching metal monster. The house sized tank slammed into Mayor Trixie&#039;s city hall, demolishing it in a spray of wood and glass. A butterscotch pegasus with a foam sword hung around her neck lifted her head out of the massive tank and looked over the destruction. She focused on several ponies running away, then shouted down to Lemon, &quot;Umm...could you drive us closer, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lemon looked up at his adopted mother, &quot;You want to hit them with your sword, Little Mother?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s eyes widened in horror, &quot;What?! No! I just don&#039;t think they&#039;ll hear the sound of my apologies over the rumble of the engines from this far away!&quot;</p><p class="double">A pink light flashed as Pinkie appeared out of nowhere, &quot;Hey Fluttershy! Looks like you&#039;re having fun, but maybe a bit too much fun. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll take you somewhere where you can have all the fun you want!&quot;</p><p class="double">With another burst of pink light, the three ponies and the massive tank teleported into Everfree Forest.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After Twilight rebuilt City Hall, re-assured the non-looping ponies that the world wasn&#039;t coming to an end and got Lemon Rush and Fluttershy to promise never to use their tank in Ponyville for driving practice, she re-appeared in Mac&#039;s bar, seeming more dishevelled than before. Mac gestured for her to continue.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s about it. Rarity has locked herself in Carousel Boutique muttering something about magical artefact modifications. The only one else I&#039;ve heard from is my BBBFF. Shiny&#039;s going to use this to test some military formations he&#039;s developed over the loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">She chuckled to herself, &quot;Something interesting about this loop, apparently Shiny has a different Lieutenant this time around. His name&#039;s Candy Cane and his appearance has made all the difference in the guard. Their skills are shaper then he&#039;s ever seen and morale is high. He was the looper who came in yesterday evening with the black military hat, red bill shadowing his eyes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac chuckled, &quot;Didn&#039;t seem ta&#039; like you and Pinkie when y&#039;all tried introducin&#039; yourselves. Couldn&#039;t get away fast enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s ears flattened against her head, &quot;You think he saw one of my earlier pranks?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac shrugged, &quot;Who knows...but I&#039;m sure ya&#039;ll win him over sooner or later. You did me, after all. Have you seen any of the others?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. The rest are keeping low profiles. Celestia and Luna are setting up geofronts all over Equestria in preparing to evacuate a good portion of the country. I&#039;m not sure if they know things will get out of hand, or if they have something big planned.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gestured for another Cider and lifted it to her mouth before muttering, &quot;I hope it&#039;s the former.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.16 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, um....&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining gave Chrysalis an awkward glance as he finished choosing his new skills.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You and Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">The queen of changelings dropped out of the half-meditative state she was in, shrugging. &quot;It was a surprise for us as well... do you not approve?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not in any position to pass judgement over you two,&quot; Shining quickly explained. &quot;I&#039;m just... this is going to sound really bad, actually, so I want to be clear I&#039;m not accusing you of anything but--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am <i>not</i> just using her as a food source.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039;s clipped tone made Shining Armor wince. &quot;No, that&#039;s not what I was going to ask. It&#039;s just....&quot; He sighed. &quot;I guess I can see how you&#039;d know if she loves you, but how do you know that <i>you</i> love <i>her?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">A moment of silence filled the dungeon chamber.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You know, maybe that was a bit too far. It&#039;s alright if you don&#039;t want to talk about--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot; Chrysalis sighed. &quot;No, I guess.... I just... Well. I just do. I mean... back when I was with, uh, the other you, I....&quot; She waved a hoof vaguely. &quot;I felt.... <i>equal.</i> Even. Focused on myself and... Trixie helps me to focus. To be, really. It&#039;s not exactly the same but I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s close enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trust me, it is,&quot; Cadance stated with a smile. &quot;I&#039;ve been around you two long enough to know that.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen jumped. &quot;I thought you were still selecting skills!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, I just like to meditate sometimes. Easy way to spy on ponies, and from spying comes manipulations comes happy couples!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor bit his lip. &quot;I&#039;m not entirely sure that&#039;s ethical dear...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">47.17</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What. The buck. Is this.”</p><p class="double">Twilight prodded it, producing a kind of &#039;pfff&#039; sound.</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “I think it&#039;s a fluffy pony! I will call it Fluffle-”</p><p class="double">“No.” Twilight shook her head. “I&#039;m not getting involved. If this is a loop peculiarity, then you can handle it. Meanwhile, I&#039;ve got a project to do before Trixie next loops.”</p><p class="double">She gave Pinkie a pointed look. “That means that you don&#039;t use my main room as a lounge.”</p><p class="double">“Awww...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight gave Pinkie a glare. “Okay, explain.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know what went wrong!” Pinkie protested. “I thought maybe Chrysalis would like to meet Fluffle, and she... vanished into the fur.”</p><p class="double">“Do you mean the looping Chrysalis?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shook her head.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight rubbed her head. “I can feel a headache coming on. Okay, this is your fault, you solve this.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Pinkie... this is <i>not</i> solved.”</p><p class="double">“I like to think of it as solved,” Pinkie countered. “I mean, look! They love her!”</p><p class="double">“They&#039;re terrified half to death that she&#039;ll engulf them like she did Chrysalis.” Twilight pointed at the cringing Changelings surrounding the fluffy pony, who now had a makeshift crown glued to her head.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “Potaeto, potahto.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>47.18 (Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom got to Diamond Tiara during the lunch recess. Subtle ways of arranging their desks and other specific but not odd responses to Miss Cheerilee had signalled they both were Awake. Neither of the other future Crusaders were but another classmate was missing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Any sign of where Silver Spoon is?&quot; Applebloom asked. The pair had staged a mane pulling fight at the start of the school year, that seemed to &#039;settle differences&#039;, so nopony thought them eating lunch together too strange.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara shook her head, &quot;No. I managed a peek in the City Hall records. Her dad is there, but he left town. According to Twilight Sparkle he&#039;s got degrees in hippopology, archeology, and ancient Mesoponytamian Culture. Left for field work I guess. Her mom&#039;s here, but she&#039;s married someone else.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom sighed, &quot;It happens DT. You&#039;ll catch up to her someLoop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tiara snorted, &quot;If she&#039;s forgiven me by then Hayseed. It just hurt they way she looked at me when I explained the Loops to her, you know?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom hoofed over one of her apple turnovers. Granny was always big on comfort food for ponies with the blues. &quot;Not really, but I&#039;ll be sure to ask if Babs starts Looping.&quot; Something by the schoolhouse steps caught her eye. A pony so tall Miss Cheerliee was on the top while the newcomer was on the ground, and still was over her head. &quot;Is she Saddle Arabian?&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond perked up, &quot;Yes. This is interesting. Maybe a guest for class?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom shrugged as she saw Miss Cheerliee tug the rope for the school bell. &quot;Guess we&#039;ll find out soon enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">As soon as the class shuffled in, Miss Cheerliee poked her head out of the door to speak to somepony. &quot;Class, we are getting a new student today. Come in and introduce yourself dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pony that came in was nearly as tall as Miss Cheerliee herself, and most of that height in the legs. She had a patterned Saddle Arabian poll cap, along with a matching blanket on her back and sash running from her withers around to her chest. It was the coat colour and the familiar spoon cutiemark that caused Diamond Tiara&#039;s heart to skip.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, my name, well would be Silver Spoon in Equestrian. Let&#039;s just go with that to avoid mangling it please?&quot; A sea of waving hooves, all but Appleblooms and Diamond Tiara&#039;s suddenly sprung up and the tall filly sighed. &quot;Let me guess,&quot; She started pointing at random and sprouting out answers before anypony could speak. &quot;Yes I am about your age, I just got Mother&#039;s height. Mother insisted I dress up for my first day. The Veil dance is a bunch of road apples made up by a randy stallion, so no I don&#039;t know it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerliee stepped in to bring the class under control. &quot;I&#039;m sure you can ask her, after class. Respectfully.&quot; She gave a baleful glare, and Fluttershy had been giving her lessons. Still not a patch on the pegasus, but good enough for now. &quot;There is an empty desk over by Applebloom and Diamond Tiara. The two that didn&#039;t swamp you in questions right out of the gate.&quot; She gave the class another look. &quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll make friends soon enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver nodded. &quot;As we say in The Sands. There are no strangers, merely old friends who have yet to meet again.&quot; Diamond Tiara&#039;s heart stopped, Silver Spoon was looking right at her as she said that.</p><p class="double">A problem rapidly became apparent however. Miss Cheerliee looked dismayed at the mismatch of a filly the size of most grown mares trying to fit into one of her desks. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;ll see about getting one you can fit into.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon pulled out a piece of cloth wrapped chalk from under her blanket. &quot;I can handle this.&quot; Before anypony could ask, or stop her she rapidly drew a strangely inscribed circle on the seat, then pressed her forehooves to it. With a flash of light the chair morphed, stretching out and up. The result was larger, but lighter looking and Silver Spoon settled into it. &quot;I can change it back after class if you like?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee reigned in her boggling and shook her head. &quot;If it is a stable change the end of the year will be fine.&quot; At the filly&#039;s nod she turned back to her lesson plan, trying to pull the gawking colt&#039;s and filly&#039;s attention back to the blackboard. She made a mental note to ask Twilight Sparkle to look at the magic, just to be certain. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The end of school saw the usual crush of foals let free rushing the door. But instead of rushing to individual destinations there was a clustering around a particularly tall and leggy member of their herd. Diamond Tiara and Applebloom shared a look and started helping her cut out as she fielded questions.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, come on! Give her some room. Not like she&#039;s gonna run off tomorrow!&quot; Applebloom found it a lot like herding dealing with her Unawake classmates.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right you lot! Let her breathe. I&#039;m sure you can talk to her some more at Pinkie Pie&#039;s party!&quot; Diamond Tiara was less physical, but just as intimidating.</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon started. &quot;She&#039;s throwing me a party?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded, &quot;Of course. Pinkie Pie&#039;s Awake, so she has to be plotting to throw you a party!&quot; Her classmates nodded, a given of Ponyville life, completely missing the emphasis.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked at Applebloom as their classmates finally started breaking up a bit. &quot;Sugar Cube Corner?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom nodded, &quot;Sugar Cube Corner. Come on Silver Spoon, we&#039;ll show you the way. Otherwise we might wind up Looping looking for you while you try to get there.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon nodded, and they managed to get through town to the Corner with relatively few interruptions. Though she was having issues adjusting to most adults being at eye level for her.</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon found herself seated in the &#039;Diplomatic Corner Booth&#039; with a costumed Pinkie walking guard as the three shared a &#039;Chocolate Boat to Tartarus&#039; Sundae. A dish that seems big enough to save a filly from a flood. Well excepting Spoon&#039;s current form. She hesitantly tested the waters. &quot;So, who is Awake now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom spoke up first, &quot;Well us three. None of the other Crusaders, and no Nyx so that&#039;s it for our age. Looks like just Pinkie and Twilight of course from the Bearers. Don&#039;t know if the Princesses are Awake or not.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked at her one time friend. &quot;So, um. How is this loop treating you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver shrugged. &quot;Being half Saddle Arabian isn&#039;t the weirdest one yet. At least this time I have enough Equestrian to keep my Cutie Mark. Being Gilda&#039;s niece was definitely weird though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked confused, &quot;How does a pony get to be a griffin&#039;s niece?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver smirked back, &quot;Who says I was a pony that time? It&#039;s weird, I seem to spend as much time as something else as a Pony, or at least pony like.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three paused to digest that, and consume more of the Boat. Diamond Tiara moved next, &quot;So was one of those &#039;other&#039; times where you learned whatever you did with the desk?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver shook her head. &quot;No, I was pure pony for that Fused Loop. Well excepting two metal legs, thank Celestia I Awoke after losing them. Hooking up replacements was bad enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked uncomfortable, &quot;err Silver? The Princesses kinda asked we Loopers not swear by them. We try to use trees instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver looked at the farm filly strangely. &quot;really? I wondered why you guys did that.&quot; She caught Diamond Tiara&#039;s nod and shrugged. &quot;Anyway, what I did was a method of rearranging matter. The particular &#039;school&#039; I used there was called Alkhestry. It fits better in Equestria than its cousin, Alchemy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked at Diamond Tiara then sighed. Looks like she&#039;d have to be the &#039;heavy&#039; this time. DT was apparently worried about hurting her friendship even worse. &quot;Are you sure you want to blow your cover this early in the loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon smiled. &quot;What, with Alkhestry? How much do you know about Saddle Arabia and it&#039;s magic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara got it first, and giggled. &quot;So you figure to pass it off as some exotic magic from Saddle Arabia?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon nodded, and tapped her flank. &quot;I apparently got this helping Daddy on a dig. Finding and restoring lost knowledge of how ponies used to live their lives. And we just discovered,&quot; Silver Spoon waved her forehooves in the air,</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara wound up chorusing with her &quot;Lost secrets of Saddle Arabian Magic!&quot; Both fillies stopped in embarrassment.</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked at one then the other as the awkward moment stretched. &quot;well I need the little fillies room. Don&#039;t eat this all while ah&#039;m gone!&quot; She trotted off.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked at her friend? &quot;Er, Silver? Are we?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon&#039;s gaze seemed to pass over her. &quot;The Fused loop I was in was a place called Amestris. It could be a rather nasty place, particularly the stuff the people me and Twilight were replacing had to deal with. But it taught me a lot about what you will do for families, and friends. So, I think I&#039;m getting there.&quot; The taller filly shrugged, &quot;Having the Princess of Friendship be your &#039;little sister&#039; probably helps.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon transmuted the surface of the table to block the epic spit take that comment got out of Diamond Tiara. </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

A quick self inspection first conformed she had hands, but wasn&#039;t human, a pony-anthro? No, a <i>pegasus</i> anthro, though her wings were hidden under a shapeless green sweater. Down below a red wolf in a fancy braided jacket was going on in fractured common to a bunch of other dogs in various forms of scruffy gear about how rich the box sitting on the table in front of him was going to make him. Then the loop memories hit. Air pirates, the mouthy mexicano moron was one Don Karnage, and she was currently in an air vent on a pirate airship called the Iron Vulture. Awesome!</p><p class="double">She was apparently one Scootaloo &#039;Scoots&#039; Skyscorcher, and a soon to be ex-pirate cabin-boy. She rifled the memories, orphanage, bullied as a freak, while this world had bird anthros with wing hands, pegasi didn&#039;t exist, runaway, hooked up with the air-pirates because she was mad about planes. She&#039;d managed to keep both wings and gender a secret from the bozos, which wasn&#039;t hard as apart from Karnage the entire bunch had more toes than brain cells. She&#039;d been with them a year, gotten fed up a lot sooner, and wanted out.</p><p class="double">Which led to her current situation. This was apparently Don Karnage&#039;s biggest score, stolen from some big wig industrialist by the name of Sher Khan, and she intended to steal it and set out on her own, acquiring a plane and licence as soon as she was of age. As plans went, it was kind of shy on the fine detail, but then she was only twelve years old. Scootaloo decided to go with it, she certainly didn&#039;t know enough about the world to start making her own plans yet.</p><p class="double">She opened the grating and dropped down onto the table beside the box. “Wow! That really is a neat treasure! No lesser pirate could have stolen it!”</p><p class="double">As she expected the egotistical canine preened, “Yes, of course, I am the fantabulous Don Karnage yes/no?”</p><p class="double">“Oh yes, and I wanted to thank you for teaching me how to lie, cheat and plunder. I guess you could call this my final exam...” She scooped up the box and sprung over his head, dropping the red bandanna that showed her pirate affiliation over his head. Using the head of the largest pirate, Dumptruck, as a stepping stone, she landed at the door and kept running. Thankfully this body had her regular lightning reflexes and acrobatic skill.</p><p class="double">“It was... wait what?” The pirate finally caught up and yelled, “Stop that boy!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo charged out of the control room and down metal gantries, yells and cries following her. She met some pirates on the way down and yelled, “Get up there and help the Captain, right away!”</p><p class="double">As they ran upstairs, she thanked Celestia for stupid villains. Dropping down to the floor of the main hangar deck, she snatched a grapnel launcher from the rack of blunderbusses along one wall and charged towards the open hangar door, shaped like a raptor&#039;s beak. Ignoring the yelling growing behind her, she charged up to the lip and dived off. She barely heard from above Don Karnage&#039;s voice yelling, “No, my treasure!”</p><p class="double">Plummeting from several thousand feet would be a concern for most people, even a pegasus whose stubby wings didn&#039;t allow her to fly. She had plenty of fixes in her sub-space pocket, but she decided to get some practice with her in-loop abilities. Her wings popped out of slits in her jumper and she angled her body to power dive towards a cloud, and plunged into it, arresting her fall. Her cloud-walking abilities were another secret she&#039;d managed to keep from the pirates.</p><p class="double">She popped her face out of the cloud to check the giant air-ship above her, which was already shedding single engined biplanes like a dog shedding fleas. Whatever else there was nothing wrong with their reactions when it didn&#039;t involve actual thought. They plunged after her, and she made sure none of them were headed right for her hiding spot before ducking back in. She tucked the box inside her jumper and made it secure.</p><p class="double">She let them dive past her and buzz around below as the cloud floated away from the search area. As she waited for them to drift out of sight, she directed a thought towards Pansy. <i>Any luck finding other loopers?</i></p><p class="double"><i>No-pony from our world, though they may simply be out of range. Locally, I don&#039;t have enough to work with yet. Clover&#039;s the real expert.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Don&#039;t do yourself down, I wouldn&#039;t trade you for a dozen Clovers. Keep trying.</i></p><p class="double">She got an impression of appreciation from Pansy, and the question, <i>So what&#039;s the mission plan?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Get to this Cape Suzette place where Sher Khan is, return his property, see what we can get out of it, if anything. After that, who knows, Ascend and age myself a couple of years then go after a plane and a pilot&#039;s license. From what I know, this world is practically built for pilots. Which means I could have a huge amount of fun here. If I don&#039;t find some kind of quest... this looks like the sort of world that&#039;ll have one, and I tick all the boxes for a starting out hero.</i></p><p class="double">The pirates had moved out of sight, and Scootaloo figured it was safe to move. She pushed her way down to the bottom of the cloud, and peeked out. Aha, a twin engined cargo job, just what she needed. She quickly fixed pads of clouds around her hooves, and power dived again, unslinging the grapple gun. A quick shot and a dash of weather magic wrapped the grapple around the leading edge of the rudder, and she swung her feet under her, pumping weather magic into them to act as flying skates. Her in-loop self didn&#039;t know how it worked, just that she could do it. Her wings could propel her as well, but not as fast as even a slow plane, and unlike her wings, a plane didn&#039;t get tired.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been careful to dive below the pilot&#039;s line of sight, as the last thing she wanted was for anyone to see her abilities. After about half an hour, they started descending towards a tropical island with some sort of resort that looked to be part tree-house, and partly built out of a wreck of an old galleon. Various wooden docks stuck out into the water at odd angles, with dozens of seaplanes of various makes and models moored at them. The big neon sign said &#039;Louie&#039;s&#039;. Now this looked like a fun place...</p><p class="double">She unhooked the grapple gun and let it drop, flying down under her own power, looking for a quiet spot to land. She found it on a beach a short way around from the main docks, and made a neat two point landing. Folding her wings back inside her jumper, she strolled around and climbed up the docks and to the main entrance. She could hear singing from inside, some guy going on about how he was &#039;gone&#039;. She slipped in the door to see filled tables and a big bear in a flight shirt and wearing a fruit salad on his head singing and dancing. However, he did seem to be looking towards the door and did a double-take as she entered.</p><p class="double">Noting it for future reference, she made her way over to the bar where an orangutan in a Hawaiian was mixing up some cocktail concoction. She bounded up onto a stool and waited for him to notice her.</p><p class="double">“Hey, short stuff, where&#039;d you spring from?”</p><p class="double">“Just flew in, but now I&#039;m here, and I&#039;d like a drink.” She pulled an Equestrian bit from her sub-space pocket. “I don&#039;t have local money, but I can pay.”</p><p class="double">The orangutan picked it up, weighing it in his hand, bit it and tapped it against the counter. “Well don&#039;t that beat all! Where&#039;d a little guy get something like this?”</p><p class="double">“Family heirloom.” Scootaloo shrugged. “So, it&#039;ll cover a drink and a meal?”</p><p class="double">“Cuz, if this is the real deal, you&#039;re covered for pretty much everything. Oh, hey Baloo, sounds like your pipes are all in tune.”</p><p class="double">“You know it Louie, heh... mind if I borrow your new friend for a minute?” The big bear was trying to sound relaxed and failing.</p><p class="double">“Not my call cuz.” He indicated the bear to Scootaloo, “This is Baloo, best pilot in the skies. He&#039;s good people. If you like planes, he&#039;s the guy to talk to. Tell you what, I&#039;ll make you one of my triple split specials. Finest sundae west of Timbucthree.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds great!” Scootaloo looked over at Baloo. “One for Baloo here as well?”</p><p class="double">“I never pass up free eats.” Baloo&#039;s voice was jovial, but still strained. He waited until Louie had moved away and said, “Who are you, and where&#039;s Kit?”</p><p class="double">“The name&#039;s Scootaloo Skyscorcher, and the only kit I&#039;ve got is what I&#039;m wearing. Let me guess, you&#039;re a looper, and I&#039;ve replaced someone called Kit who you were expecting instead.”</p><p class="double">“Hey yeah, but what&#039;s a looper... are you talking about the way things keep happening over and over?”</p><p class="double">“Oh horse-feathers, sounds like you&#039;re new to all this. How many times has it happened for you?”</p><p class="double">“About thirty, forty times, you know what&#039;s going on?”</p><p class="double">“Oh pony, looks like my turn to give the &#039;welcome to the multiverse&#039; speech.” She glanced around, and whispered, “Pansy, holo-projector and a perception filter please.”</p><p class="double">She proceeded to give him loops 101, complete with pretty pictures. Over the loops they&#039;d gotten it down to a fine art. As she put away the projector. “To sum up, looks like you&#039;re Anchor for this world, Kit will return next loop, and from how close you two are, he&#039;ll probably start looping soon too.”</p><p class="double">Baloo was shaking his head. “Kiddo, that&#039;s gotta be the craziest story anybody&#039;s ever tried to sell me. But I never saw anything like that gadget you pulled either, so I guess I&#039;ve gotta believe it. So where&#039;s little britches?”</p><p class="double">“Could be he&#039;s skipped this loop, could be he&#039;s swapped with me. Pretty much anything can happen with the loops.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Great and Powerful Trixie, you&#039;ve got to vanquish the ursa.”</p><p class="double">The Unawake stage magician freaked as she watched two hundred hooves of astrological ursine stride down the main street of Ponyville. “But... no-pony can vanquish an Ursa! I just made up the story to make my act better!”</p><p class="double">Snips and Snails went through the border checkpoint of &#039;Uh oh!&#039; and joined her in the land of freaking out.</p><p class="double">She mustered her magic, got ready to try and stop it, when the beast&#039;s jaws gaped, and it said in a surprisingly teenage voice, “Hey, pony lady, I don&#039;t want trouble, I just want someone to tell me what the heck is going on! What kind of crazy dream is this? I go to sleep in my bed at Higher for Hire, and next thing I&#039;m waking up in some cave somewhere with those two running around my feet! What am I, what are you, what&#039;s going on?”</p><p class="double">“What? What...” Trixie was eloquent in her incomprehension, at least until her eyes rolled up and she fainted.</p><p class="double">“Well that was helpful.” The bear groused. “You two, do whatever you do for fainted ponies, I&#039;m sitting right here until someone comes up with some answers.” He sat back on his haunches in the main square, carefully, checking to see he didn&#039;t crush anything by accident.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So what normally happens next?” Scootaloo asked, as Louie brought over their triple split sundaes, towering concoctions of fruit, ice cream and whipped cream.</p><p class="double">“Don Karnage and his yahoos generally show up, looking for Kit and that gem. I usually have us high-tail it out of here before then, but I don&#039;t think we can make it...”</p><p class="double">The doors slammed open, and Karnage and his goons strode through them. Scootaloo dropped down behind her stool and whispered, “You go get your plane started, I&#039;ll distract them.”</p><p class="double">“You sure kiddo? These are dangerous guys.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve got this. Make sure those sundaes are to go, I&#039;m not missing out on that.”</p><p class="double">“I am sorry to fracture the festivities,” the pirate captain announced, walking in and picking up a drink off the table, “but I have a little announcement.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was already using the tables as cover to get around to a balcony, the perfect place to attract their attention. Meanwhile Karnage was wasting time posing and threatening Louie. Oh, he was getting extra for that!</p><p class="double">She got in position and made her preparations just as one of the pirates fired a warning shot at the roof.</p><p class="double">“Hey, no need to wreck the place, Karny!” she called out. “I was just leaving anyway!”</p><p class="double">The red wolf crook&#039;s head snapped round, and he yelled, “Get him!”</p><p class="double">Three pirates charged up the stairs towards her just as she jumped up on the rail, snatching a tiki mask to use as an improvised board, and slid down the bannister, springing and tumbling over the hands that grasped for her. She&#039;d already plotted her route from when she flew off the end, and spun end for end while grabbing a bowl of soup from a passing table. The pirates finally managed to get themselves turned round and followed her back down the stairs. As they did, she flung the bowl to smash just under where the lead pirate, a whiny suck-up be the name of Mad Dog was about to put his foot. He slipped, fell and in the process tripped the pirates charging down after him, leaving them in a nice pile at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p class="double">Of course, Scootaloo had other problems to cope with, namely a problematic pirate captain with a pointy cutlass who&#039;d jumped into her path, legs wide and sword out. She&#039;d turned back to face him, and he sneered at her. “It is the funny joke you are making, but I shall have the last ha ha!”</p><p class="double">“Pass!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo snatched the nearest thing she could see, a serving fork from a half eaten roast, and folded backwards, limboing low on her board to slide between the pirate&#039;s akimbo legs, and fending off the cutlass with the fork. Just to finish off, she prodded him from behind with the fork as she slid onwards, sending him jumping with a yowl of pain.</p><p class="double">She straightened up just in time to push her way through the now empty doors, and cursed not having enough time to say something like, <i>The forks are strong in this one...</i> Pansy, who&#039;d gotten caught up on hub universe fiction, groaned inside her head. She was heading down the pier, slowing as she ran out of momentum, and at the end was a yellow cargo seaplane with a red bow and it&#039;s engines turning over.</p><p class="double">Baloo stuck his head out the open door. “You okay, kiddo?”</p><p class="double">“Never better!” She bounded off the tiki mask as she noticed a familiar heavily armed tri-plane docked near him. “Get moving, I&#039;ll be along in a moment!”</p><p class="double">She might not be in Apple Bloom&#039;s league when it came to gadgets, but she knew something about aircraft engines. She flipped the cowling and ripped out a number of important wires, throwing them out to sea.</p><p class="double">There was a howl of fury as Don Karnage burst out of Louie&#039;s, followed by his goons. “Stop him... Shoot you ridiculous rodents!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo ducked as a blast from a blunderbuss shot over her head, then weaved her way along the dock as other blasts peppered the air around her. At least one took off half the propeller of another pirate biplane. She reached the already moving Sea Duck and dived through the doorway, slamming the door after her.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve bought us some time... Maybe I should have flown it away... no, too much start up time.”</p><p class="double">The seaplane was already surging forward under Baloo&#039;s skilled coaxing. “C&#039;mon baby... wait, you can fly?”</p><p class="double">“Anything from a Sopwith Camel to a Star Destroyer!” Scootaloo responded proudly, “Though in-loop, not yet, though I&#039;ve mad for planes as long as I can remember.”</p><p class="double">“Well you&#039;d better buckle up!” The Sea Duck lurched as the keel unstuck from the water and it soared up into the sky. “Yahoooo! Oh man, there&#039;s no better feeling than hitting the blue!”</p><p class="double">Baloo threw the Sea Duck into a barrel roll, taking the chance to check the island below, “Hey, looks like you got Don Kebab and his mixed meatheads all riled up.”</p><p class="double">“That was the idea. You should know that while that guy can keep an idea in his head, unlike the rest of them, two is beyond him. I didn&#039;t just escape, I publicly embarrassed him. He&#039;s going to want to catch me alive himself simply so he can personally chop me into bite sized pieces. That means he&#039;s not letting the rest of his goons follow us until his plane&#039;s fixed, and it should keep him from taking it out on the bystanders at Louie&#039;s.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but when he gets fixed up, he&#039;s going to be after us horse, foot and marines.”</p><p class="double">Baloo was slightly shocked by the calculation in the young ponies voice, and some part of it must have leaked into his voice, because Scootaloo looked over at the bear in the pilot&#039;s seat, then turned and hung her head. “I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;ve kind of taken you for granted. I&#039;m not your friend Kit, I&#039;m just someone who met you a few hours ago and already I&#039;ve dragged you into danger with me.”</p><p class="double">“Hey kiddo, don&#039;t sweat it. Ol&#039; Karny and me have crossed propellers plenty of times, and he&#039;s always been the one who ditched at the end of it. Besides, I&#039;d never leave anyone in the clutches of that two bit pirate.”</p><p class="double">“Well anyway, thanks. So where are we heading?”</p><p class="double">“Cape Suzette, you&#039;re going to love it!” They were straight and level, and he looked over at the pegasus, grinning. He flipped open a compartment to reveal two slightly melted triple splits. ”I even got desert. Chow down.”</p><p class="double">It only took a few moments to polish off the sundaes, and Scootaloo looked over the plane she was in properly for the first time. The cockpit had the look of long use, but had been well cared for and extensively customised. Some of the tweaks almost seemed familiar. She consulted her in-loop memories. “Wow, this is a pretty sweet set-up. A Conwing L-16 with Super-Flight 100 customised engines? This thing must really move!”</p><p class="double">“Good eye kiddo!” Baloo patted the console. “Yup, she&#039;s my baby. Me and Wild Bloom have spent a lot of time getting her just right... Wait... what?”</p><p class="double">“If that&#039;s who I think it is, sounds like I&#039;m not the only fused looper. Earth-pony, good with gadgets? Yellow coat, red mane in a bow?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much, though she wears a jumpsuit... Except she should be a male lion called Wildcat. But I remember meeting up with her, working together on the Sea Duck, everything just as clearly. Oh man, this is too weird!”</p><p class="double">“Welcome to the wonderful world of fused loops. Your in-loop memories say one thing, your real memories say another. We&#039;ve gotta get you doing some mental exercises to help you keep things straight.”</p><p class="double">“Whoa, I ain&#039;t any kind of brain, kiddo.” Baloo shook his head.</p><p class="double">“Neither was I, but even I managed to learn them. Besides, if you can get it down, you can learn to create a sub-space pocket, a way to store things so you can carry them between loops.”</p><p class="double">“Now that sounds like a mighty useful thing to know!” The big bear glanced over at the young pony, who was looking at the control yoke in front of her with a familiar eagerness. “So, you said you can fly. Can you fly a Conwing L-16?”</p><p class="double">“Never tried, but I&#039;d love to find out!” Scootaloo reached out and took hold of the yoke, closing her eyes for a moment as her fingers closed around the grips. She seemed to freeze for a moment, attentive to something only she could sense. “Hello, Sea Duck. Baloo&#039;s lucky to have you.”</p><p class="double">Baloo had seen Kit take his first grasp of the Sea Duck&#039;s controls dozens of times, and for all his natural talent, he was quite naturally somewhat clumsy when he actually took the yoke. Scootaloo was different. When her eyes opened, they flicked back and forth across the instruments as easily as his own. She held the Sea Duck steady and on course like a veteran pilot, and he started to believe what she&#039;d told him, not just with his head, but with his heart.</p><p class="double">“Can I, please?” she asked, and didn&#039;t need to say more. At his nod, she started doing gentle turns and banks around their base course. She&#039;d flown planes far faster than this, and far more advanced, but she could feel that this one, for all it&#039;s primitive technology and limited flight envelope was something special. What she really wanted to do was try out some real stunts, she knew the Sea Duck could take them, but she was only too aware of the privilege she&#039;d been given by flying the Sea Duck at all, and she didn&#039;t want to abuse it.</p><p class="double">However, her piloting experience included a lot of combat flying, and it was that that caused her to suddenly go into a wing-over and dive.</p><p class="double">“Hey what the...” Baloo was answered by the whistle of machine gun bullets behind them.</p><p class="double">“Six coming in four o clock high!” Scootaloo rapped out, putting the Sea Duck in a tight roll that put her into a nearby cloudbank. “You have the stick?”</p><p class="double">Baloo had grabbed his own yoke as soon as they&#039;d started spinning, but he&#039;d let Scootaloo complete the manoeuvre, as it was pretty much what he&#039;d have done himself. “Roger little dodger, now watch this pre-formance!”</p><p class="double">The cloudbank ran out unexpectedly, ejecting them into a maze of towering storm clouds, lightning crackling around them. The pirate biplanes shot out a few seconds later, but scattered and no longer in the deadly staggered echelon formation they&#039;d previously held. Baloo played an expert game of tag with the pirates, swooping, zooming, turning and spinning to somehow out-manoeuvre fighters in a cargo plane.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was itching to get involved, but this was Baloo&#039;s world and his plane. She wasn&#039;t used to being a passenger while some-pony else was paying the freight. However, she tried to sit back and appreciate the big bear&#039;s clear mastery of the situation. At one point he managed to do a wing-over and return to fly straight through the bad guys, scattering them like pigeons, then trolled them into following him into a power dive, right to sea level.</p><p class="double">The seat of her pants that Scootaloo wasn&#039;t wearing felt distinctly uncomfortable as they headed for the water, but it was clear Baloo had some plan in mind, and she managed to hold on to her impatience and the sides of her seat as at the last split-second he pulled a lever who&#039;s function had puzzled her and leading edge flaps flipped up, altering the angle of attack and giving him the lift to pull out into level flight. Several splashes behind them indicated the lead pirates hadn&#039;t been so lucky.</p><p class="double">“Okay, now that was cool!” The pegasus glanced up and back. “But there are some still up there and they&#039;ve got us pinned against the sea. I&#039;ve got some tricks of my own that might help...”</p><p class="double">“No need kiddo, see those puffs of smoke?” Baloo pointed to some cliffs ahead with a narrow gorge between them. There were white puffballs appearing from around the tops.</p><p class="double">“AA Fire?” Scootaloo asked, and was answered seconds later by bursting noises from above. She glanced out of the window and saw explosions above in the heart of the pirate pack. They scattered and high-tailed it out of there with Karnage&#039;s plane in the lead.</p><p class="double">“Yep! The cliff guns of Cape Suzette. Drives &#039;em crazy!” Baloo said with a lazy grin as they climbed away from the sea. Scootaloo switched her gaze away from the approaching cliffs and to her companion, who was relaxing back in his seat.</p><p class="double">“You know, you remind me a lot of Rainbow Dash... I think you saw her in the pictures. She&#039;s the rainbow maned pegasus and she&#039;s the most awesome flyer in Equestria. She&#039;s also the Element of Loyalty and would never leave some-pony hanging.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like you think a lot of her.”</p><p class="double">“Well yeah, she basically took me under her wing, taught me everything she knew and is pretty much my big sister. I guess you and Kit have something similar. I really hope he starts looping soon himself. You both deserve it.”</p><p class="double">There was no calculation in the pony&#039;s voice this time, and Baloo made a decision. “Well until he gets back, seems I&#039;ll be needing a replacement navigator. You up for the job?”</p><p class="double">“Am I ever!” Scootaloo returned eagerly.</p><p class="double">“Then welcome aboard, Scoots.” Baloo opened a storage compartment and handed her a green baseball cap. She put it on as they flew through the gorge and out into a wide lagoon.</p><p class="double">“Oh, wow!” Once again, Scootaloo had seen far larger and taller cities in her time, but this was one of the prettiest. Art deco towers with sky bridges made a wide crescent around a vast lagoon with an island in it, and were built back into the hillsides of the bowl that enclosed it. And everywhere there was air-traffic, dirigibles, sea-planes, flying back and forth. It made Canterlot sky-port look like a village cross-roads in January.</p><p class="double">She noticed one of the biggest towers had a logo which her in-loop memories told her stood for Sher Khan, and that jogged her memory. She pulled out the box. “Oh, hey, I&#039;ve still got this. Want to hand it over to Khan before Karny and his merry mutts make another grab for it? In short, what&#039;s the plan, big man?”</p><p class="double">“Huh, normally Kit hides it back at Louie&#039;s... Welp, I hook up with Kit, head on back to base, find out I missed the last six payments on the Duck and have to stump up three large ones, three thousand bucks or they&#039;ll foreclose at nine tomorrow.” He grinned. “Of course lately, as soon as I find myself back at Louie&#039;s at the start of each... loop? I ring up a bookie in Cape Suzette and put on some accumulators I know will pay out. Easy money.</p><p class="double">“But first time round, we did a high ticket mission which I blew when Karny captures Kit, and he offers to share the reward for the gem in that box, except it&#039;s not a gem, it&#039;s some sub-electron dohickey that can create a lot of power. Khan&#039;s willing to fork over a solid hundred thousand for it&#039;s return, and Karny wants to use it to build a lightning cannon to come plunder Cape Suzette.”</p><p class="double">He shrugged. “Man, first time round we went all over the place to try and get that thing back. Turns out Becky, that is Rebecca Cunningham, bought up the company from the bank to run, which made her my boss. Now I don&#039;t fuss about business, flying&#039;s all I&#039;m interested in, so I was trying to find the fifty k to buy myself out of hock. Cutting out the drama, the pirates make their play, we stop them, destroying the stone in the process.</p><p class="double">“I end up back behind the eight ball, flying for Higher for Hire, Becky&#039;s new name for the company, with her as the boss lady. Of course, now I&#039;ve been round the block a couple dozen times, I can get round that easy enough, and did, but you know, it&#039;s like that time I saved Khan&#039;s life and he gave me pretty much anything I asked for, or when I found out I&#039;d inherited a fortune and a big house. It got lonely being just me, or even me and Kit. So now I let her buy the place just to get her involved.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like quite a lady.” Scootaloo replied. “Is she your special some-pony... some-body?”</p><p class="double">Baloo barked out a laugh. “Me and Beckers? Not in a million years! We&#039;d drive each other crazy, heck, we do drive each other crazy! She&#039;s a stickler for everything being just so, and I like to take a more relaxed att-i-tude. She&#039;s pushy, bossy, mercenary, comes up with crazy moneymaking schemes at the drop of a hat... and she&#039;s someone I&#039;d trust with my life, and a good friend.”</p><p class="double">“Except for the moneymaking part, that sounds just like another friend of mine, Diamond Tiara. I wonder if she&#039;ll be showing up here. If Apple Bloom is here, we might see some others...”</p><p class="double">“Man, how many more are there?”</p><p class="double">Recounting the other members of the Crusaders took them all the way round the bay and until they taxied up to the dilapidated dock that led to the ramshackle building that housed &#039;Baloo&#039;s Air Cargo Service&#039;. Except the was freshly painted and now said, &#039;Higher for Hire&#039;.</p><p class="double">“What the Sam Hill?” Baloo shook his head in disbelief, and stormed out of the Sea Duck and up the dock.</p><p class="double">A pink female pony of more adult proportions with wavy purple hair held back with a bandana was backing out of the doorway. She wore a white turtleneck and violet slacks, and was carrying a bale of old newspapers neatly tied up with string.</p><p class="double">“Hey lady, who are you and what do you think you&#039;re doin&#039;?” Baloo called out.</p><p class="double">She dropped the bundle besides a bunch of others and turned to face him. “The names Tara, Tara Cunningham, and as of 9 am this morning I own this place and that plane.”</p><p class="double">“But that&#039;s not till tomorrow, and you ain&#039;t Beckers...”</p><p class="double">Wild Bloom came out, equally grown up, wearing a tatty set of overalls and carrying a box of junk. Her mid-Usland accent was even more pronounced than usual. “Sorry Baloo, I tried to boost the radio to get you the message, but the bank came with the paperwork yesterday. She&#039;s got a bunch of lawyer&#039;s papers and everything.”</p><p class="double">Baloo started to get mad, then realised something. “Then I&#039;ve got just one question for you all. Are you Awake?”</p><p class="double">The stress he put on the word clearly hit a bullseye. Tara slumped slightly and said. “Oh darn, and I wanted to see if I could turn this place into something that could give Khan Insustries a run for their money.”</p><p class="double">He heard Scootaloo&#039;s voice behind him. “Guys, this is Baloo Von Bruinwald, Anchor and our host for this loop. He&#039;s still in his first century. I gave him the intro speech and told him about us. Do we have Sweetie Belle and Nyx on board?”</p><p class="double">The two ponies in question came out, younger than usual and wearing rompers. Sweetie Belle exclaimed, “Present, and I hate being a rug-rat!”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara waved a hand at them and said, “Meet my &#039;daughters&#039;, Belle and Nyx Cunningham.”</p><p class="double">Wild Bloom rubbed the back of her head and said, “Sorry guys, but this world doesn&#039;t have computer records, if you want to bump your ages a bit, it&#039;ll have to wait until we can find the paperwork and rig it.”</p><p class="double">Baloo was looking around at the five of them, and just shook his head. “Man, and I thought my life was complicated enough already!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo grinned as she joined up with the other Crusaders. “Don&#039;t think of it as complicated, think of it as interesting!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Come on.&quot; Apple Bloom was smirking. &quot;I know you have one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....the shape was good for runic circles,&quot; Silver Spoon admitted.</p><p class="double">&quot;AHA! I knew it! Let&#039;s see, come on!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And silver&#039;s a good material!&quot; continued the currently Saddle Arabian filly. &quot;It&#039;s not like I--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Silver, I&#039;ve made mechanical flowering fruits. Sweetie&#039;s created shaped candies that ring. Heck, Diamond <i>wears</i> hers in the baseline.&quot; The farmfilly shook her head. &quot;It&#039;s nothing to be ashamed of.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a resigned sigh, Silver reached into her subspace pocket and pulled out something twice her size.</p><p class="double">Pinkie chose that moment to walk in. &quot;...that is one big spoon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Apple Bloom pointed at a small stain. &quot;Is that...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, yeah. I used this in fights a lot.&quot; Silver shrugged. &quot;It made sense at the time.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.3 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double">The Incredible Mac</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac awoke. The first thing he noticed were the murmurs of shock around him. At first, he thought they might be directed at him, but no, they seemed to be directed at a teenage boy riding his motorcycle through the desert in front of him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whats he doing? He&#039;s going to be killed!&quot; said a gruff, male voice beside him.</p><p class="double">He didn&#039;t know what was going on; his loop memories hadn&#039;t set in, but he knew he couldn&#039;t let that happen. He leaped out of the bunker he was in and ran toward him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">He hadn&#039;t gotten far when the first of his loop memories hit him. All from his first memories to the latest last night.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">He&#039;d been working on something called a Gamma Bomb? These human loops were always kinda weird. But then again, Trixie would&#039;ve probably gone gaga for something like that.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d been doing some last minute checks on the thing with his fiancee Betty Ross. </p><p class="double">&#039;Fiance, huh? Wonder if she&#039;s awake or not?&#039;</p><p class="double">The door opened. In walked two people his loop memories instantly recognized as General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross and Major Glenn Talbot. His loop memories and the looks those two were giving him told him that they didn&#039;t like him and that the feeling was mutual.</p><p class="double">“Is everything ready on the Gamma Bomb?” there was a tone of barely restrained anger in the General&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">“Yup.”</p><p class="double">The General&#039;s eyebrow visibly twitched. He turned to Betty and his expression softened immediately.</p><p class="double">“Betty, can I talk to you for a second? In private?”</p><p class="double">“What is it Father? If you can say it in front of me, you can say it in front of Bruce.” there was an edge to her voice.</p><p class="double">General Ross nodded to the Major. “Leave us for a few minutes, Major.”</p><p class="double">“Yes sir.” He saluted and left.</p><p class="double">The General composed himself. “You know I don&#039;t approve of your dating ...”</p><p class="double">“Not this again!” she cried. “We&#039;ve been over this before. We&#039;ve got nothing to talk about! “ </p><p class="double">“Betty..”</p><p class="double">“I really think you should go.”</p><p class="double">The General turned to Bruce and his face hardened. “This isn&#039;t the last of it. Don&#039;t even think for a moment that I&#039;ll let you marry my daughter.” saying that, he put his hat back on his head and left.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Which lead him back to today. The Gamma Bomb was going to explode, and some dumb kid decided to drive out in the middle of the testing site.</p><p class="double">Getting him to safety me managed to toss the kid into the bunker just as the blast was about to hit. &#039;Whelp, looks like this&#039;ll be one real short loop!&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac hurt. Near as he could tell he was in a bed, probably in a hospital, hopped up on anesthetics and worst of all, people were talking, preventing him from getting any rest.</p><p class="double">&#039;Why Mac hurt? Why people talk? Why can&#039;t they just leave Mac alone?&#039; he wondered to himself.</p><p class="double">“severe concussion, broken arm...” Through the fog of the anesthesia, he could just barely make anything out.</p><p class="double">“survived the gamma bomb..”</p><p class="double">“needs to be studied..”</p><p class="double">Something must have changed as his head got foggier, the voices vanished and he surrendered to sweet oblivion.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Good morning!” The one he knew as Betty Ross entered the room. She closed the door behind her and removed what looked like a small silvery notepad from somewhere. She fiddled with it for a few seconds and spoke.</p><p class="double">“Ok. No bugs....and I&#039;ve put up a privacy screen around this room. It should be safe to talk.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re looping?” Mac asked.</p><p class="double">“Yeppers.” Betty crossed the room and took a seat at Mac&#039;s bedside.</p><p class="double">“Well, that makes this less awkward.” Mac was visibly relieved.</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m assuming you&#039;ve got some questions.”</p><p class="double">“Eyup. So does that bomb thing always happen?”</p><p class="double">“Mostly. Sometimes its a gamma reactor. Sometimes Bruce just like Gamma radiation and decides to experiment on himself. It varies.”</p><p class="double">“So is Bruce, I&#039;m assuming its not MacIntosh, the loop anchor?”</p><p class="double">“Banner. No he&#039;s just a looper, same as me. That kid you saved, Rick Jones, however, is the loop anchor. Well, probably. It could be Steve Rodgers, or possibly Doreen, or maybe that Parker kid. All we know is that those 4 loop a lot. Its...complicated.”</p><p class="double">“Complicated?”</p><p class="double">“Well, those 4 seem to be always looping, but we&#039;re not really sure if they&#039;re anchors.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm..”</p><p class="double">“Oh! Do you feel a pool of energy in your mind?”</p><p class="double">Mac closed his eyes.</p><p class="double">She continued. “One of the effects of the gamma radiation is that it tends to turn you into a huge mass of muscle. Go ahead. Try touching it.”</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean besides deadly radiation sickness?&quot;</p><p class="double">Betty sighed. &quot;Just do it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac reached out with mind and tried touching the pool of energy. From nothing, it became a raging torrent of energy that tore through him, giving Mac&#039;s already impressive muscles an even bigger boost. From here on, his bed started collapsing under the weight and his casts popped off from the stress. It took some effort, as the energy threatened to overwhelm him, and his muscles burned from the growth they were experiencing, but he managed to retain control of his mind.</p><p class="double">“<b>That was dangerous, Lady.”</b></p><p class="double">“But you did it!”</p><p class="double">“<b>What would&#039;ve happened if I hadn&#039;t”</b></p><p class="double">“You would&#039;ve rampaged across the dessert with the army and Father in hot pursuit.”</p><p class="double">Mac glared.</p><p class="double">“Please, it what usually happens whenever Bruce isn&#039;t awake.”</p><p class="double">Mac raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">“He, you, whatever, gets angsty about the transformation, which usually only triggers when he&#039;s mad, and becomes obsessed about trying to cure himself, which never works, because something or someone always interrupts it. Either the Hulk himself...”</p><p class="double">Mac looked quizzically at Betty.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s you, by the way. Or the Army, or SHIELD, or the Leader, or the Abomination...well you get the picture. Which brings me to my next point. Father had decided that since you absorbed all this radiation without any side-effects. Well, the normal side-effects of dying horribly of radiation sickness, that&#039;s something that must be studied and used for the benefit of the United States Army. He&#039;s transferring you to a secure facility in a few days. They&#039;ll be poking and prodding you for years until they get something useful. The fact that it&#039;ll separate us is just the cherry on top in Father&#039;s view.&quot;</p><p class="double">“<b>We&#039;ll have do something about that.” </b>A spring on his bed popped to as if to punctuate his last statement. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Betty and Rick stood out in the desert.</p><p class="double">“So you know the plan?” asked Betty</p><p class="double">“Who&#039;s the anchor here? If anything I should be asking you that.”</p><p class="double">“So..ask.”</p><p class="double">“Whats the plan?”</p><p class="double">“Ok, so you transform into Colossus...”</p><p class="double">Rick just glared.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, not Colossus, I meant The Thing.” said Betty, grinning.</p><p class="double">“Very funny, Ms, I&#039;m She-Hulk, but Red.”</p><p class="double">“Tough crowd. Fine...you transform into A-Bomb. That&#039;s still a dumb name, by the way, and I transform into Red She-Hulk, and we go in and bust out Bruce. He transforms, we fight and gracefully lose, Bruce is a hero, or at least less of pariah in Father&#039;s eyes.”</p><p class="double">“And if we&#039;re captured?”</p><p class="double">“Clones, from an alternate future, come to set right what once went wrong.”</p><p class="double">“Eh..close enough.”</p><p class="double">“So we leave now?” A distant explosion rocked the valley.</p><p class="double">“<b>I&#039;d stay that&#039;s a yes.”</b> said Rick as he transformed into a giant rock-like being with Betty transforming right behind him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The military convoy was in ruins. Soldiers either milled about expecting new orders, or waited to receive treatment. They raised their rifles as Red She-Hulk and A-Bomb approached.</p><p class="double">They put up their hands “<b>Whoa. We mean you no harm. What happened here?”</b></p><p class="double">“Thats classified.” said Major Glenn Talbot stepping forward.</p><p class="double">“<b>I think its obvious. Someone attacked the transport, made off with whatever cargo....and headed in that direction.”</b> said Red She-hulk, pointing to some tracks.</p><p class="double">“Lets go!” They leaped off in the direction of the tracks.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For the second time, Mac awoke in an unfamiliar environment. He was horizontal in a glass and metal tube. Restraints held down his arms and legs. Looking through the glass covering above him, he could see people in yellow clothes and masks at work beside him.</p><p class="double">&#039;They kinda look like beekeepers. No sign or Rick or Betty. Plan probably went wrong, so this is probably as good a time to make my entrance.&#039;</p><p class="double">Once again he tapped into that pool of green energy in his mind, and the tube suddenly became very cramped, but shattered as he continued growing. There were shouts of alarm and he continued freeing himself.</p><p class="double">“<b>Don&#039;t get up. I can help myself.” </b></p><p class="double">Finally freeing himself he leaped up through the ceiling, only to find himself in midair as he seemed to have just left some sort of aircraft. As he continued falling, the aircraft made a lazy turn and started heading back the way he came. Coming toward him and passing him? But it looked like something else emerged as it flew by. A silvery android, that hit the ground a minute after Mac did.</p><p class="double">“<b>What are you?”</b></p><p class="double">The only response from the android was to shift into a form similar to Mac&#039;s own, green and heavily muscled.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Avocado.&quot;</b> Mac swore. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&#039;Okay. What am I up against?&#039; asked Mac to himself as he dodged a blow to his head. The android seemed as strong and as durable as him. The fact that they&#039;d been fighting for 5 minutes already with no sign of the droid weakening meant that it probably had a pretty strong power source. The glowing aura coming from the android&#039;s chest confirmed it. But it also didn&#039;t seem to have that much in the way of imaginative. Its attacks were, no pun intended, mechanical and Mac was dodging most of them.</p><p class="double">&#039;Now what are my assets and skills.&#039; What most readily came to mind were his muscles, which he was already using. There was his bartender skills, but there wasn&#039;t a bar for miles, and unless he could challenge the droid to a contest of mixing drinks, didn&#039;t see how that would be any help. The android didn&#039;t seem to be open to negotiation, as he hadn&#039;t spoken at all, and hadn&#039;t visibly reacted to anything he&#039;d said. He wondered if this whole android business was just a stalling action for other reinforcements to move into position, but he&#039;d yet to see anyone else show up during the battle. Maybe this was a test of the android&#039;s abilities? Or maybe his?</p><p class="double">The only thing Mac hadn&#039;t tried were any of his earth pony abilities. He hadn&#039;t a chance to practice any of them in this body, and wasn&#039;t sure they would work, but this was as good a time as any.</p><p class="double">First, bucking. Mac charged his fist with power and swung at what looked like a vulnerable spot. The droid&#039;s left arm at the elbow came clean off, launching far into the distance. The droid paused for a moment, its elbow becoming liquid metal, stretching and reforming into another arm and hand.</p><p class="double">“<b>Eucalyptus.”</b></p><p class="double">&#039;This is going to be annoying, but this means I can probably puncture its chest cavity if it would just stop moving.&#039;</p><p class="double">The second ability he hadn&#039;t tried was earth pony plant growth. However, just from looking around he could see he was in a desert, and there wasn&#039;t much he could work with. Reaching out with his senses he tried to sense the plant life in the area. Not much, except he was detecting a bunch from inside the android. That didn&#039;t make sense, unless... you counted the various seeds and pollen usually in the air. This android must have an air intake, and have brought into itself thousands of tiny seeds. Normally, it wouldn&#039;t have been a problem, but...</p><p class="double">“<b>Lets add a little something to the mix!”</b> Mac reached into his subspace pocket and removed a packet of apple seeds. Perhaps not the best choice for what he was going to try, but it was what he had on hand. Once at the same time, he torn open and threw the opened bag at the android. At the same time he slammed his foot into the ground, pouring as much earth pony magic into it as he could. The explosion of plant growth was enormous. Right in front of him grew an enormous apple tree, a conglomeration of at least a hundred seeds, which as it expanded threw him back.</p><p class="double">Mac landed not so gracefully. The tree continued expanding, but slower now. Mac leaped into the branches to see if he could locate the android. Reaching out with his senses, he could feel it...there! Using his earth pony magic, he bent a path through the ever expanding branches.</p><p class="double">Mac finally found the android. It was completely locked down the branches of the tree, and could gain no leverage as it tried to free itself.</p><p class="double">“<b>Still moving, huh?”</b> Mac reached up with his fist charged, grabbed through the android&#039;s abdomen to the source of its power he felt earlier. It promptly stopped moving.</p><p class="double">Through the light of the tree, Mac examined what he pulled out. It seemed to be a small glass cube, about a 3 centimeters in length on all sides, and it literally pulsed with energy. He tossed it into his subspace pocket. He could examine it later if he got access to a proper lab.</p><p class="double">He then went out and waited for someone to arrive.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac didn&#039;t have to wait long. It was another few minutes before a helicopter approached his position and landed.</p><p class="double">&#039;A giant tree appearing in the middle of the desert must be an incredible beacon.&#039;</p><p class="double">It had a circular emblem of what was probably a stylized falcon on it. Its side opened up, and occupants that he mostly recognized popped out. He could see someone who probably Betty and what she had described as Rick in his A-Bomb form along with General Ross. Also, a bunch of agents in blue uniforms that appeared to be commanded by am eye-patched woman with purple hair that he felt he should have recognized, but didn&#039;t. The agents in blue surrounded him with rifles pointed at him.</p><p class="double">Mac shifted to his human form. Privately, Mac wondered where the purple pants had come from, and why when he switched back, his pants were back to normal.</p><p class="double">“General. Unknown Gamma mutated beings who I&#039;ve never seen before.” and then he turned to the woman. “I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t have the honor, Miss..”</p><p class="double">“Nicole, Nicole Sparkle, Director of SHIELD.”</p><p class="double">Recognition finally hit Mac. “Pleased to meet you, Director Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“This is all very well, but we&#039;ll need to take Mr. MacIntosh into custody. He&#039;s vital to the interests of the US military.”</p><p class="double">“I think we could possibly come to an arrangement. Mr. MacIntosh, how would you like to come work for me?”</p><p class="double">The General sputtered.</p><p class="double">“This offer would apply to you two as well,” nodding to Rick and Betty, who decided to shift to human form as well at this point.</p><p class="double">“Betty? What? How?”</p><p class="double">“Merged with a temporal duplicate of myself from alternate timeline.” said Betty.</p><p class="double">“Same.” mentioned Rick</p><p class="double">“Director, I think I&#039;d like to take you up on that offer.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie left the stage to the sound of cheers. “Ah, now that&#039;s something which I <i>really</i> enjoy about Looping.”</p><p class="double">Her glamorous assistant followed her, using a towel to clean whipped cream off her face. “Why do I always get splatted?”</p><p class="double">Trixie turned, looking indignant. “Firstly, because slapstick is always funny. Second, it&#039;s not always you. I got gunged back in Trottingham.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; towel stopped moving. “Okay, I had forgotten that one.”</p><p class="double">“Lucky you,” Trixie muttered. “It took me half an hour to clean my cloak.” Then she got a mischievous look on her face, darted forwards and licked some of the cream off.</p><p class="double">The disguised Changeling flinched momentarily. “Gah! Warn me next time!”</p><p class="double">“Make me,” Trixie challenged, sticking her tongue out.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; eyes narrowed. “Maybe I will,” she said, as they reached the wagon.</p><p class="double">Bigger on the inside, of course. Trixie&#039;s baseline wagon was fine for one, but applying a simple Potterverse charm on it made it suitable for two without Trixie having to tow a Conestoga.</p><p class="double">“Shouldn&#039;t we set off first?” Trixie asked, a quaver in her voice. “I mean, we do need to get to Manehattan by tomorrow evening, and it&#039;s a fair way.”</p><p class="double">“Well, you should have thought of that first,” Chrysalis said reasonably. She dropped her shapeshift.</p><p class="double">There was a flash of light, and an envelope landed on the table.</p><p class="double">“...huh.” Trixie trotted over and picked it up. “I wasn&#039;t expecting a letter. Were you?”</p><p class="double">“Changelings don&#039;t bother with post,” Chrysalis pointed out.</p><p class="double">“And it&#039;s not from one of your lovers in every port of call?” Trixie teased.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis winced, then grinned. “Okay, you win this round. Now, what&#039;s in the letter?”</p><p class="double">Trixie slit the seal, holding it up for inspection. “Canterlot master of ceremonies, very posh. I remember whenever Twilight and I are co-students of Celestia, we saw a lot of this.”</p><p class="double">“Usually attached to damage bills and the occasional lawsuit, if I recall right,” Chrysalis snarked.</p><p class="double">“Same difference.” Trixie drew the contents out. “Oh. Oh-ho-ho!”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked over her shoulder. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">Trixie moved the letter so she couldn&#039;t see. “Aherm. &#039;The Master of Ceremonies of Canterlot Palace has been requested and ordered by their majesties, Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, to invite you, Trixie Lulamoon, along with guest, to the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in one month&#039;s time.&#039;”</p><p class="double">They exchanged glances. And then, in near perfect unison, grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What on Equestria is <i>that?</i>” Blueblood said, staring at the newest entrants to the hall.</p><p class="double">Trixie tossed her head, making her starred dress ripple and catch the light. “Yes, bask in the reflected awe of the Great and Powerful Trixie!”</p><p class="double">“Not <i>you</i>,” Blueblood said, frowning. “I mean the... the... <i>thing</i> next to you?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Oh</i>,” Trixie said in tones of sudden understanding, nodding exaggeratedly. “You must mean my date. She has a name, and it&#039;s Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double">Seeing that most of the room was now staring, Trixie patted Chrysalis on the back. “She&#039;s a queen, you know.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis beamed at the room. This only showed her fangs, which made some of the assembled notables back away a bit.</p><p class="double">“Chryssy!” Celestia said, sweeping into the room with her student and her sister trailing behind her. “I&#039;m so glad you could make it!”</p><p class="double">“My pleasure,” Chrysalis replied warmly. “How is your sister doing?”</p><p class="double">“I am fine, thank you,” Luna answered for her sister, making a slight bow. “I don&#039;t believe I have met your date, however.”</p><p class="double">Trixie fought to keep a straight face, as the five Loopers all acted as though it was perfectly normal to see a Changeling at the Gala.</p><p class="double">Sure, explosions were cool. But as far as pranking the Gala went, Blueblood&#039;s expression right now was <i>priceless.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">48.5</p><p class="double">“I feel weird...” Silver said, experimentally ruffling her wings.</p><p class="double">Her aunt, Gilda, looked down at her with a mildly parental expression. “Not surprised, fledgeling, you&#039;re a whole new body type.”</p><p class="double">“Something like that happened a couple ago, too,” Silver informed her. “My first fused loop, where I picked up Alchemy and Alkahestry, I had two missing limbs.”</p><p class="double">“Cool,” Gilda declared, nodding. “That was probably your formative loop, then.”</p><p class="double">“Do those always happen?” Silver spread her wings and beat them as fast as she could, rising a little off the ground. “Ow, this is exhausting.”</p><p class="double">Gilda reached out a foreclaw and supported her breastbone. “Easy, fledgeling. Flying&#039;s as much about technique as brute force, doing it like that&#039;s only going to strain something. And no, they don&#039;t always happen.” Silver stopped trying to fly, and Gilda deposited her back on the ground. “I&#039;ll teach you in a sec. Some loopers – a lot of human ones seem to do this – just keep learning from a lot of different loops, never really picking a speciality. Some of our locals just don&#039;t have the <i>need</i> to develop a specific skill set over others – take Sparkle, she&#039;s all about magic.”</p><p class="double">“I see... I think,” Silver said slowly. “And... your formative one was wherever you picked up that weird magic you do?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Gilda demonstrated, letting her body bleach white. After a few seconds, tufts of fur or feathers developed at her haunches, and red accents touched up her otherwise brilliant white coat.</p><p class="double">Her tail-tip seemed to be on the verge of releasing a drop of ink.</p><p class="double">“I learned a couple of forms of the brush magic there, and then picked up the rest a bit at a time.” Gilda&#039;s colours went back to normal in a moment. “I&#039;ve also become a dab hand at painting, too, which is nice. Stress-relieving.”</p><p class="double">Silver nodded along. “What about – Tiara?”</p><p class="double">“Her?” Gilda cawed laughter. “She&#039;s the most hard-assed bitch I&#039;ve ever met – and that&#039;s a compliment, really. She&#039;s basically picked up two things – psychic powers, you know, telepathy and scrub like that, and also a mean tactical sense.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Silver Spoon thought that over for a bit.</p><p class="double">“Hey – how do gryphons... well, the gryphon government. How does that work?”</p><p class="double">Gilda sat back. “Okay, so we&#039;re predator-types. I&#039;ll bet you see me instinctively as big and tough, and there&#039;s a little niggle in the back of your mind evaluating if you could take me.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Silver blushed. “I didn&#039;t know I was so... arrogant?”</p><p class="double">“Gryphons are arrogant, it&#039;s healthy.” Gilda waved it off. “So, we&#039;re arranged into... well, prides or packs, the meaning is the same. Your village is a pack, your county is a pack formed of the village higher-ups, and so on up to Imperial level. You can move up in two ways – either by election, which is sort of a contest of strength of mind, or by combat, which is a contest of strength of body.”</p><p class="double">The elder looper waved her foreleg. “Elections are kinda recent, historically speaking. Anyway, you can only challenge either way within a pack. So if Joe Average Gryphon wanted to become Emperor, he&#039;d start at the village level. If he won there, he&#039;d be a member of the county pack, and could move up there, and so on.”</p><p class="double">“What about you?”</p><p class="double">Gilda coughed. “I have an unfair advantage. I&#039;m... well, we&#039;re... sort of members of the Imperial family. That counts as a pack, too.”</p><p class="double">Silver digested that for a bit.</p><p class="double">“Griffin civil wars must be complicated.”</p><p class="double">“Yep, pretty much.” Gilda shrugged. “Mind you, the pack leader usually has a band of sworn talons who he can have kick the arses of any potential challenger, so he doesn&#039;t have to spend the whole day fighting. In practise, successful challenges involve those sworn talons either stepping aside or getting whupped en masse – and either way, we as a species tend to be alright with that.”</p><p class="double">“I think I see. So...” Silver examined one of her claws minutely. “So it all gets sorted out in duels?”</p><p class="double">“Better than wars,” Gilda agreed. “And we do a <i>lot</i> of betting on the outcomes.”</p><p class="double">“So.” Silver raised her wings again. “Flying?”</p><p class="double">“Right. Flight basics.” Gilda thought for a bit. “First off, how to glide. It&#039;s fairly simple in practise, just hold your wings out stiff.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s it?” Silver followed the instructions. “Now what?”</p><p class="double">“Now...” Gilda grinned. “We teach you the gryphon way.”</p><p class="double">Her tail slashed across left to right three times, making a set of three parallel horizontal lines.</p><p class="double">The resultant instant tornado sent Silver rocketing over three hundred feet into the air.</p><p class="double">“Okay!” Gilda shouted up. “Now... sorta fall less.”</p><p class="double">“HOW?” Silver asked, panicking.</p><p class="double">“Stop falling!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I officially hate gryphon teaching methods,” Silver muttered, pulling twigs out of her feathers.</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged. “You were really making progress there. Before you hit the tree. All cleared out?”</p><p class="double">Silver inspected her wings. “I think so.”</p><p class="double">“Good!” Gilda said, bringing her tail up again. “Ready for gliding practise session two?”</p><p class="double">With a yelp, Silver turned and fled.</p><p class="double">The elder gryphon chuckled, walking lazily after her. “Wonder when she&#039;ll notice she just flew up the cliff...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">48.6 (Vulpine Fury):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mac?&quot;</p><p class="double">The farmer-become-bartender raised his head in curiosity. &quot;Eeyup?&quot;</p><p class="double">...and was bowled over by a smiling and crying Cheerilee. &quot;I&#039;m home!

It wouldn&#039;t be the first time. If he&#039;d done the math right, the Loops liked to hook up his baseline version with the schoolmarm about one in three times, which could make things like pre-scheduled dates awkward if he Awoke later than usual.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m home!

That was a plausible reason for her to Loop. And now Applebloom was included in the hug? So probably not that problem. Was this how Shining Armor felt around the looping changeling queen?</p><p class="double">Macintosh made a mental note to pay particular attention to Cheerilee in the coming loop.

<p>49.1</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon gathered herself, ready to return to Equestria and take her vengeance.</p><p class="double">“Come along, children, this way!” a cheerful voice said.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait, what?</i> The Nightmare looked in the direction of the voice, which was behind a small hill, and crept up to the lip of the ridgeline so as to look over.</p><p class="double">A motley group of confused-looking colts and fillies were gazing around themselves, or occasionally picking something up to marvel at the low weight. One, a pegasus, was flapping her small wings frantically and beaming as the effort resulted in a hover.</p><p class="double">At the head of the group were two adult mares. One was an earth pony with a daisy-based cutie mark and carrying a piece of chalk in the side of her mouth, while the other was a purple unicorn levitating a blackboard alongside them. Nightmare Moon could also sense the magic side-wash of a powerful air bubble spell, providing breathable air for the whole assemblage of ponies.</p><p class="double">The earth pony mare stopped and turned around, making Nightmare drop back out of sight in case she was spotted. There was the sound of something heavy landing on the regolith, and then the screeching of chalk on blackboard.</p><p class="double">“Now, who can tell me anything about the moon? Yes, Scootaloo?”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re so light here! It&#039;s awesome!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s correct.” The screech of more chalk. “The moon is smaller than Equestria, and a little less dense. That means that the total gravity here is only one sixth of that on the surface of our home planet. What about you, Snips?”</p><p class="double">“Uh... I guess there&#039;s that we can see Equestria. It&#039;s huge – and really bright!”</p><p class="double">“Yes. Like the moon is in our sky, we&#039;re in the moon&#039;s sky. But Equestria is several times larger than the moon, so since we&#039;re the same distance away from it as we normally are from the moon, it looks larger. And yes, Equestria reflects more light than the moon does, so it appears brighter.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare peered over the ridgeline again, using a convenient rock for cover.</p><p class="double">“Something else you might not have noticed about the moon,” the earth pony mare said, “is that it doesn&#039;t have an atmosphere. There&#039;s no air on the moon.”</p><p class="double">“Uh... what are we breathing, miss Cheerilee?” a unicorn filly asked. As she said that, an earth pony did an exaggeratedly dramatic act of suffocating.</p><p class="double">“Good question, Sweetie Belle. Twilight here didn&#039;t only get us to the moon, but also cast a spell which has given us air. If you could demonstrate, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">The air-bubble spell altered slightly.</p><p class="double">Twilight – presumably, at any rate – picked up a feather and a hammer from the tray of the blackboard. Holding them up, she dropped them.</p><p class="double">The feather drifted slowly to the ground, while the hammer fell as fast as things normally did on the moon.</p><p class="double">She retrieved them, and then dropped them outside the area of the air bubble. The hammer fell just as it had, but this time the feather fell just as fast.</p><p class="double">“Now, what happened there?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, it looks like it&#039;s home time, everypony. Tomorrow we&#039;re going to be doing the inner planets. Say thank you to Twilight for kindly lending her time!”</p><p class="double">“Thanks, Miss Twilight,” the children said in the not-in-unison chorus normal for school pupils.</p><p class="double">Then there was a bright purple flash, and Nightmare was alone once more.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t know quite how to take that. The fillies and colts had certainly seemed to be interested in her moon...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.2 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Luna, I think I need to visit my student in the near future.&quot; Celestia said, reading her mail.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Luna looked up from her book. &quot;Has Twilight Sparkle done something wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps? I&#039;m confused by the content of her friendship reports. They are wonderful little cartoons, and we had a lovely correspondence about how she animated them, but she doesn&#039;t seem to understand my problem with them.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Well now I&#039;m curious </i>&quot;Oh? May I see one, Sister?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Certainly, here&#039;s the one she just sent. Tap the symbol to activate it.&quot; Luna look the offered scroll.</p><p class="double">&quot;What I learned today: Book, Cover, yada yada. Is that a zebra? It seems Twilight Sparkle has learned a lesson in racial prejudice.&quot; Luna said, looking up from the scroll. &quot;Unorthodox as this letter is, it does get to the point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, often in a single sentence,&quot; Celestia sighed, &quot;But this is not what I had in mind when I asked her to write reports.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe thy poor student simply doesn&#039;t know else how to express what she&#039;s learning? As I understand this is beyond her previous experience.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Right, parasprites next. Hm, amusing as it&#039;d be to send this one off uncensored, I&#039;m gonna have to rewrite it.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Weeks later...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A grim faced Celestia burst into her sister&#039;s chambers. &quot;Luna, we&#039;re going to Ponyville, Twilight might be in grave danger.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What danger, Sister? Is the town under attack?&quot; Luna inquired, standing from her desk.</p><p class="double">Celestia pulled a scroll from under her wing. &quot;Look at her latest letter.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t ignore Pinkie, or she&#039;ll cut you. What! A cry for aid, if ever I heard one! Swiftly Sister, ignore the chariot, we must teleport!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Bishop Riso Bessemer was the head priest of Pelor at Zagy City temple. While this required he be a fairly powerful cleric, courtesy of an adventuring career when he was considerably younger, in the present it mainly required paperwork, lots and lots of paperwork. At least it was a fine day, and the window to the balcony of his chambers was open, letting in a warm breeze as well as bright sunlight. However, as he craned over the latest scroll, the light dimmed as a shadow appeared across the window.</p><p class="double">He looked up and was shocked to see a pegasus standing there, perched on the balcony and completely unafraid. Pegasi were notoriously shy, and avoided human contact, which made those captured and trained as mounts worth a medium sized fortune. He&#039;d seen a number of odd things in his past career, but this was definitely up there. However, things got a whole lot weirder when the pegasus spoke. Pegasi were human smart, but they couldn&#039;t form words, everyone knew that, except apparently the pegasus in front of him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there, are you the guy in charge of this place?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I am, however, I am still a humble servant of Pelor. Bishop Bessemer, at your service.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great, the name&#039;s Rainbow Dash, and I&#039;ve got a problem I need some help with, your bishop-ship.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pelor tells us to help those who need it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cool! Okay, so I&#039;m a pegasus, but I&#039;m from another... plane, that&#039;s the term, and I just arrived here. Pegasi are a bit different where I come from, but I&#039;m stuck in a body for this world&#039;s version.&quot; She held up a hoof. &quot;Even a human body has better range of motion, and I lay eggs, and that&#039;s just plain wrong. Griffons lay eggs, not pegasi. Well, sometimes...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure how you expect Pelor to help you. Each of us is made the way we are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I can fix things myself, but I&#039;ve gotta power-up, use some whammy from my home dimension, and my friend Twilight figures the gods will get annoyed if we start throwing the heavy-duty bibbety-bobbity-boo around. So I figure, Pelor&#039;s the big good over-deity, right? If he gives us the okay, the rest of them won&#039;t cause a ruckus, well maybe the evil types, but buck &#039;em, I&#039;m on the side of good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You claim to have powers sufficient to bring the notice of the gods?&quot; Bessemer was recovering nicely. Whether this pegasus was telling the truth, or was just plain insane, this was far more interesting than paperwork. Besides, he thought he saw the hand of Pelor in this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well Twilight does, and she knows everything there is to know about magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You have a human wizard as a companion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wizard yes, human no. She&#039;s a unicorn, but last time we were in this plane she did a whole lot of adventuring as a wizard. I was a monk, got pretty good at it too. Obviously I worshipped Pelor, Kord too, I mean not in the going to temple every chance I got sort of way, but you know... I helped beat up evil and protect the innocent and be the best I could be, and all the stuff they say you should...&quot;</p><p class="double">The Bishop actually chuckled. &quot;I&#039;m sure Pelor is more interested in what&#039;s in you heart than on your lips.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great! So obviously I&#039;m not looking for a freebie here, what can I do to make this work? I&#039;ve got some gold to put towards good works and such...&quot;</p><p class="double">With the oddness of what had already happened, the idea that she had money too wasn&#039;t such a stretch, but he simply replied, &quot;I shall have to pray to Pelor for guidance on this matter, but I already have one idea. A paladin, Lady Salmara Melnor, holds vigil in the temple below, she is young and inexperienced, but she has already shown both courage and compassion in the service of Pelor. She seeks a mount to carry her on further adventures. A seasoned adventurer would be of great help to her. Would such a task interest you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash tried to rub her chin with a hoof, and winced because her bones didn&#039;t flex that way. &quot;A Paladin&#039;s mount? Yeah, I could go for that. It&#039;s not like we had anything planned... Aw man, I don&#039;t know if Twilight would go for it...&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a flash, and Twilight appeared. &quot;Dash, don&#039;t dash off like that... Oh, chlorophyll!&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to Bessemer. &quot;I&#039;m sorry sir, my friend gets a bit over-enthusiastic...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s fine. In fact, we were just discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. I believe you wish to use some abilities from your home plane that you are worried may cause issues with the gods. I would like to know more of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, wait a second, I thought you said using powers was a big no-no!&quot; Dash exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Teleport spell, it&#039;s only fourth circle, and unicorns can teleport without error inside their groves anyway. All in-loop abilities, so with a bit of tweaking and a Locate Person spell, I was good to go. But I guess I owe the good bishop an apology, and an explanation...&quot;</p><p class="double">A short explanation later on both sides, and the Bishop finished with. &quot;I will have to mediate and pray to Pelor for his advice, but I am sure he will give his blessings on those who use their abilities to aid his cause.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;C&#039;mon Twilight, it sounds like fun!&quot; Dash said, and Twilight considered the matter. &quot;I guess it would be something different. I never got to finish off studying the higher circle spells... if I could get access to various colleges and such as we travel around... Alright, I&#039;m in!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity fidgeted as Photo Finish snapped her pictures of Fluttershy. This could be her big break, but the intensity of the mare made it difficult for her to interpret her thoughts. The mare had her crew pack up the cameras and turned to leave–</p><p class="double">The door to the boutique burst open and Rarity could only watch in horror as her big break was barrelled over by the biggest tomboy in Ponyville. After a moment of confusion, the mare in question sat up, shook her head, and looked down at the unamused photographer. &quot;Oh! Glad to see I&#039;m not too late.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash!&quot; The fashionista trotted over, scandalized. &quot;What in Celestia&#039;s name do you think you&#039;re doing?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I heard my mom was in town.&quot; Dash got off Photo Finish and helped her up. &quot;And it&#039;s been a while since we&#039;ve talked, so I figured – Oh hey, mom, this is my friend Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ve haf met,&quot; Photo Finish stated dryly. &quot;It iz good to zee vu, mein blitzschlag, vut I vus on ze way to arrange for ziz quietschende schmetterling to be ze model in mein new line---&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Rarity said with a very forcibly calm face. &quot;I just want to clarify. Rainbow Dash is your daughter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ja.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; The unicorn nodded. &quot;Well, I must say she is a fine pony, although the fact she&#039;s related to you is... a tad surprising.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um...&quot; Fluttershy blushed from her stage. &quot;I, uh... I thought you knew already. I would have told you, but, um... well...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, me and mom...&quot; Rainbow rubbed the back of her head. &quot;We kind of move in different circles. But she&#039;s still my mother, so... yeah.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Only pony besides you to ever get me in a dress.&quot;</p><p class="double">Photo Finish&#039;s ears perked. &quot;Oh? Somevun else haz finally wrapped up mein kleine blitzschlag?&quot; She smiled slyly. &quot;Iz ziz vun your herz-knoten?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus gagged. &quot;Oh, ew! No. No, definitely no. Rarity&#039;s just a friend. Granted, she&#039;s a friend that managed to convince me to wear frills, but – just – no mom. Just no.&quot; She stuck out her tongue and crossed her eyes. &quot;Ew.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy giggled.</p><p class="double">Rarity finally managed to reassess the situation. &quot;Yes, quite. You would not believe the fuss I had to go through designing her gala dress!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ja, mein blitzschlag haz alvays been a fuss fuss...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And then she got my baby pictures out,&quot; Rainbow said, sipping her drink. &quot;I mean... Rarity&#039;s not Awake, all I was trying to do was do her a favour, but.... Eh, I can&#039;t really complain. I was awesome even as a foal.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rolled her eyes. &quot;That and Photo Finish really loves you.&quot; She raised an eyebrow. &quot;Does her being your mother happen... often?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well.... it&#039;s about one in ten. When I&#039;m awake, anyway. We&#039;re usually estranged.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....I am somehow far less surprised then I should be.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Girls, Ah have a very important announcement to make. Ah&#039;ve been workin&#039; on a secret project fer a while now, something that Ah think you&#039;ll like. Course, I kinda got stuck for a bit, but then Silver Spoon here helped me with some of her out-o-loop magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom paused, glancing at the silvery sea serpent standing next to her. &quot;Um... by tha way, why are you Steven&#039;s niece this time round?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As far as Twilight can figure, the Crash hit my identity code and knocked off the species marker.&quot; Silver shrugged awkwardly. &quot;The admins are probably getting around to fixing it, but it&#039;s not high on the priority list.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Okay.&quot; The earth pony flicked her tail and turned back to the other two crusaders. &quot;Anywho. This project started with lots o&#039; crossreferences. Evangelion, Transformers, tha Marvel fused loop, Twilight&#039;s Twibot thing–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The time you took me apart?&quot; Sweetie asked innocently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah only did that one time.&quot; Apple Bloom rolled her eyes. &quot;And ah put everythin&#039; back. But... yes. That did help a mite. And Silver here, miss Alchemist – even if it&#039;s not really alchemy like what we got here – she managed ta give me the final component. Girls, ya ready ta have yer minds blown?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo leaned back onto her pillow. &quot;Eh, sure. What you got?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom grinned, taking off her necklace and putting it on the ground. &quot;Cookie? It&#039;s yer show now.&quot;</p><p class="double">For a moment, nothing happened. Then the gem in the necklace pulsed.</p><p class="double">Metal slats and squares began to unfold from a space outside space, pushing the necklace off the ground and raising it up. Panels slid across each other in a complicated, strangely familiar pattern. Metal pistons clicked into sockets and became covered by armor. Whirring and groaning reverberated throughout the clubhouse as the crusaders watched in growing awe.</p><p class="double">And with a final snap, a metal pony stood before them. Apple Bloom beamed. &quot;Fillies, may Ah present tha Robotic Armor and Partner mode fer intelligent devices.&quot; She grinned as two other necklaces manifested on the necks of the gaping fillies. &quot;Purely data, so Ah can transfer it right away <i>and</i> it carries between loops.&quot; A yellow hoof rapped against the pony&#039;s barrel. &quot;She&#039;s hollow too, in case we need a suit of powered armor in a jiffy.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Cookie?</i> flashed Clover hesitantly. <i>How... How do you feel?</i></p><p class="double">The metal pony shifted its head down. &quot;Sorry, this is still new to me. I&#039;ve barely gotten speaking down, but...&quot; She managed to decently mimic a smile. &quot;I can move. It&#039;s... it&#039;s amazing, really.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Well, I&#039;m sold,</i> flashed Pansy. <i>How soon till you have the pegasus model ready?</i></p><p class="double">Apple Bloom sighed. &quot;See, that&#039;s tha thing. Smart Cookie here doesn&#039;t even have Earth Pony magic, let alone pegasus or unicorn magic. Add to that tha difficulty she had in learning to move...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The fact is my kind of alchemy wasn&#039;t made for equestrian magic,&quot; Silver Spoon explained. &quot;I&#039;m... pretty sure I can fit it in eventually, but until then you&#039;ll just be pony shaped. And there&#039;s no real automatic processing, you have to control every joint manually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s like learning to walk all over again,&quot; Smart Cookie added. &quot;Pretty much literally, using bones and muscles that nopony had before. We&#039;d probably get it down in a few loops, but until then, we&#039;re just going to be clumsy animated suits of armor.&quot; She chuckled awkwardly. &quot;I&#039;m afraid to even lift my hoof because I could lose my balance...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>....still,</i> Clover mused. <i>It&#039;s a start. Mind if I assist you in your development of this project?</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m also ready to help,</i> Pansy offered quickly. <i>Although of course.... I wouldn&#039;t want to be seen as abandoning Scootaloo--</i></p><p class="double">The pegasus finally shook her head out of her amazement. &quot;Abandon? Pansy, I would never think that! You&#039;ve helped me a lot, you deserve this. If anything, I&#039;m willing to throw my hat in the ring too!&quot; She grinned. &quot;Maybe an expert pilot can figure out how to get these things in the air.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooo ooo ooo! If the magic&#039;s rune based it might be possible to interweave some musical notations in the spell for more flexibility and, uh, tactile senses!&quot; Sweetie hopped up. &quot;Count me in too!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.6 (Starfata)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright class.” Cheerilee began. “In light of recent events, I’ve decided we’re going to be taking it easy today.” Recent events being the beginning of her third loop, but her class clearly thought it meant the Summer Sun celebration. She waited a moment for their cheers to die down.</p><p class="double">“So, we’re moving on to Geography and Culture a few years earlier than usual.” She said, with a joking wink to calm down the more studious of the foals. “Today, we’re having a guest come in to answer questions about their home. Can anyone guess who it is?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle?” A young Apple Bloom raised her hoof- not the looping version, she hadn’t displayed any of the signs that the looping Sweetie Belle had taught her last loop.</p><p class="double">“Good guess, but no Apple Bloom.” She answered. “We’re not learning about Canterlot today.”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara wasn’t looping either- the filly seemed so much crueller now that she had seen what the spoiled filly had the potential to become. Her hissed insult to Apple Bloom would have escaped her entirely in the original timeline.</p><p class="double">“Enough Tiara.” She said sharply. “If you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.”</p><p class="double">She glared at the filly until she settled down with a grumble. And she’d taken lessons from Fluttershy in her first loop. Impressive display of stubbornness from the child.</p><p class="double">“Alright. Any other guesses?” She asked again. Nopony raised their hoof this time, which she had already expected. That didn’t mean she wasn’t a little disappointed.</p><p class="double">“Nopony?” She asked anyway. There was a moment of awkward fidgeting before she smiled and called out. “Alright, you can come in now Zecora!”</p><p class="double">Her students gasped in horror as the Zebra walked in.</p><p class="double">Zecora ignored their reactions as regally as any Princess could, and bowed her head in greeting.</p><p class="double">“Good morning to you all on this day, I hope you listen to what I say.” The zebra began. “Though I live in the Everfree, my homeland is still dear to me. I’ll tell you the tales of where Zebra’s roam, Zebrica our heart and my own first home.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee smiled at her friend. This was going to be so much <i>fun</i>. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.7 (Stainless Steel Fox) (More Turning the Tables: necromantically raised plot thread edition)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As they moved away from the clearing in the direction Prince Blueblood indicated and Zecora confirmed, they heard a voice from behind them, three voices. “Hey, wait for us!” “Big sis, I&#039;m coming too!” “Rainbow Dash, wait up!”</p><p class="double">The three not-yet Cutie Mark Crusaders were scrambling down from the deck of the wrecked airship, Scootaloo dropping down with her wings buzzing to slow her fall, and Apple Bloom simply leaping down, using her Timber wolf pup body to it&#039;s best advantage. Sweetie Belle had the most difficulty, hanging over the edge until Apple Bloom turned and climbed her front legs up the side of the airship to provide an improvised ramp. Each of them carried oversized and bulging saddlebags.</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. “And now we know why the weight calculations were off.”</p><p class="double">“Okay missy, you are in trouble!” Applejack told the mini-Timber Wolf. “I told you to stay behind, where it&#039;s safe!”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom cringed slightly, which looked odd on a vicious predator made of thorns and branches, but straightened up and looked her big sister in the eyes. It helped that even as a pup, she was the same height as a regular pony. She wasn&#039;t able to keep a slight quaver out of her voice, but there was determination there too.</p><p class="double">“I know I am, and I don&#039;t care if you ground me for a month, or even a year. You taught me family always sticks together, and that an Apple always pays her debts. Well I ain&#039;t going to let you two face that mean old Nightmare without me, and I got a debt to pay her myself for turning me into a walking tree! At least like this, I can help, really I can.”</p><p class="double">The last part was almost pleading, and accompanied by green glowing puppy-dog eyes.</p><p class="double">“Sweetie Belle! What do you think you were doing?” Rarity asked, equally acerbic. “And how did you get on the airship in the first place?”</p><p class="double">“We all met up underneath that table while we were hiding from Nightmare Moon, and we got talking afterwards, when everyone said you were going to go after her. I wanted to help too, and see you defeat that nasty Nightmare Moon. We helped with unloading the airship and managed to hide in the lockers in the cabin while every-pony was running around. We brought all the candy we could find.”</p><p class="double">“Candy?” The non-sequitur actually blunted Rarity&#039;s wrath.</p><p class="double">“Well, we sort of thought... Nightmare Moon likes candy so much she eats it rather than foals on Nightmare Night? Well we decided when you were fighting Nightmare Moon and she got an advantage and she was all, &#039;I have you now my little ponies! Mwahahaha!&#039; you might need a distraction so we&#039;d throw bags of candy at her and she&#039;d go &#039;Yum candy!&#039; and be all distracted and that would give you time to um... do whatever you&#039;re going to do!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a super-dooper plan!” exclaimed Pinkie Pie. “What? If some-pony threw bags of candy at me I&#039;d be totally distracted!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah! Not that Rainbow Dash needs a distraction to kick her flank all the way to Las Pegasus! I wasn&#039;t going to miss a chance to see Dash do something that awesome!” Scootaloo looked up at the hovering Dash with worshipful eyes.</p><p class="double">“Hey squirt, just because you&#039;re right doesn&#039;t mean this isn&#039;t some serious storm cloud we&#039;re heading into. We don&#039;t have time to babysit!” Dash was her usual tactful self. Then she saw how the word had crushed the orange pegasus filly and back-pedaled. “I mean we can&#039;t get distracted... we won&#039;t... oh horse-apples!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo looked ready to burst into tears and the others were all starting to put their own two bits in. As the babble rose, Twilight pushed out a low level muting spell and said, “We don&#039;t have time for an extended discussion! Every moment we delay, Nightmare Moon strengthens the bindings on Princess Celestia and frees more power to turn against us! I know the three of you meant well, but you&#039;ve put us in a difficult position. We have to decide what to do, and quickly.”</p><p class="double">She&#039;d already made a decision, having the three of them along should prove interesting, and she was sure of her ability to protect them, at least better than if they were out of sight. Now to justify it to the others.</p><p class="double">“Take them back, of course!” Rarity replied.</p><p class="double">“And lose all the time we&#039;ve made twice over? We&#039;d be too late. Splitting the party is out too, we needed everyone to defeat the last attack, and who knows what skills we&#039;ll need next.”</p><p class="double">“Couldn&#039;t you do that daylight thingie you did before and make this place safe?” asked Dash.</p><p class="double">“Between myself, Shining and Zecora, I&#039;m pretty sure I could, but considering the chaotic magic of the Forest and the Nightmare influence, it&#039;d need us here to sustain it for any length of time. I&#039;m sorry, but it seems the safest place for these three is with us.”</p><p class="double">She felt a slight twinge of conscience arguing this way, but the fact was that she&#039;d have argued exactly the same way from an in-loop perspective, quite apart from any meta-reasons. The plain fact that they were at hazard, and there was nothing to be done about that. Even a long-range teleport to carry them back was risky, because of the chaotic background magic levels. Doable if she went full alicorn, but she&#039;d already decided to use that only as a last resort. </p><p class="double">The three fillies looked ecstatic, and Applejack and Rarity close to mutiny. Twilight turned to them with a stern expression. “This isn&#039;t some sort of reward, and it isn&#039;t a game. If Nightmare Moon succeeds, that&#039;s it, all of Equestria is doomed. So you can&#039;t mess about! Stay close to your sisters and obey every order they give you without question! Is that understood?”</p><p class="double">“Um... but Miss Twilight, I don&#039;t have a sister....” Scootaloo offered nervously.</p><p class="double">Twilight mentally kicked herself, but didn&#039;t show it. “Rainbow, Scootaloo clearly looks up to you. Will you take care of her?”</p><p class="double">For a second, Rainbow actually looked frightened, then covered it up as she glanced down and saw the little pegasus looking up at her worshipfully. “Uh, I guess so... C&#039;mon kid, you&#039;re with me...”</p><p class="double">The sunshine in the pegasus&#039;s smile would have warded off even Nightmare Moon for a bit.</p><p class="double">“If all the drama has now past, we can be on our way at last!” Zecora said, moving ahead.</p><p class="double">As they forged on through the winding paths of the Everfree under Zecora&#039;s expert guidance, Applejack managed to ask Twilight, “Uh, Sugarcube, how did you know Scootaloo&#039;s name? I sure didn&#039;t recognise her.”</p><p class="double">Twilight deflected the awkward question with a shrug. “Someone pointed her out at the celebration – don&#039;t remember who. Rarity&#039;s sister too. Darn, now that&#039;s going to bug me for the rest of the day...”</p><p class="double">They continued for several minutes more, and then Zecora slowed down and started looking slightly confused. “I&#039;ve travelled these paths both near and far, but now I know not where we are. The way I came was right and true, but now I don&#039;t know what to do!”</p><p class="double">“No matter, I have kept a chart of our progress. I can easily find the right direction.” Blueblood boasted. He pulled a piece of parchment from a saddlebag and examined it, then frowned and turned it back and forth. His horn glowed, and then his eyes went derpy. “Ahhh! I don&#039;t know where I am!”</p><p class="double">“You and everyone else.” Dash snarked.</p><p class="double">“But I have absolute direction sense, it&#039;s part of my talent! I always know exactly where I am!”</p><p class="double">“Y&#039;know, that explains a lot...” Twilight murmured to Rarity, then lit up her own horn. “Ohhh, clever.... Shiny, can you sense that?”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour&#039;s eyes grew distant,, then he growled, “Illusion spell!”</p><p class="double">“A subtle one too, low powered, so well done even I didn&#039;t spot it until too late. Nightmare Moon&#039;s next attack, she&#039;s covered the entire area in a field that distorts our perceptions. If we can&#039;t find our way to the castle, we can&#039;t defeat her.”</p><p class="double">“But surely now you know it&#039;s there, you can counter it, darling, can&#039;t you?” Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">“I can try, but this thing could cover a huge area. If I don&#039;t get it all, it could flow back, warp things further. I&#039;ll try a wide area dispel as a last resort, but there&#039;s one thing we can try before that. An alicorn trumps unicorn magic, but she can&#039;t out-do the Elements, specifically the Element of Honesty. Applejack, you&#039;re the one pony who should be able to see past the illusion. Just concentrate on what&#039;s real, what&#039;s true.”</p><p class="double">“Uh... that&#039;s all very well, Twilight, but I don&#039;t know which way to go.”</p><p class="double">“But you can describe what you see, and that should give Zecora enough to go on. If we can just get moving, I should be able to start plotting the field strength and tell when we get near the edges.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re sure about this Twi?” Applejack asked. It was one thing to be told about her Element, and another to actually have to try and use it. And despite her honest desire to make things right with Zecora, it was still going to be odd working alongside the zebra after all the stories. Still, a pony had to do what a pony had to do. She walked up to the front of the party alongside Zecora, and focussed on the feeling she&#039;d had earlier when she&#039;d been listening to the zebra&#039;s story, judging it. </p><p class="double">At first she felt nothing, and then a warmth started burning in her chest. Her vision turned blurry for a moment, then she felt as if she was shaking off some sort of fine cloth. When her eyes could focus again, the scenery around her had changed, and there was the top edge of a large cliff running across their path. If they&#039;d kept on, they&#039;d have probably run right over it.</p><p class="double">She described what she could see around her in as much detail as possible, and it was clear from the others&#039; expressions that none of them were seeing anything like it. Zecora looked particularly puzzled. “I think I know where we&#039;ve come to, but how we got here I&#039;ve no clue. Bear to the left and follow the ledge, and have a care and avoid the edge!”</p><p class="double">They followed the earth-pony in single file into what appeared to be a massive thicket of sharply thorned brambles, but as they approached, it melted away to either side. It continued the same way, Applejack describing what she saw and Zecora telling her where to go. Barrier after barrier turned out to be nothing more than a phantasm, and every apparent path turned out to lead to disaster. Twilight&#039;s horn lit at intervals, and she muttered to herself.</p><p class="double">If she&#039;d gone full alicorn, she could probably have blasted the illusion away, but in-loop as a unicorn, what she&#039;d said was the truth. Besides, doing it this way was taking the focus off her and letting the others have a change to shine. Eventually the landscape started to match what Applejack was describing, as they emerged from the illusion.</p><p class="double">“Celestia, that was a sneaky one!” Shining Armour exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“And it&#039;ll get worse before it gets better.” Twilight sighed. “Princess Luna&#039;s domain was dreams, magic, and the night, and Nightmare Moon twisted all those things to evil purposes. She&#039;ll use mental attacks as much as physical ones. But as long as we stay together, we can beat her.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah! That old meany Moon can&#039;t stop us! We work together like cake and ice-cream... or ice-cream and more ice-cream, or ice-cream and chocolate, or candy-apples and hot sauce...”</p><p class="double">Everyone looked oddly at Pinkie, except for the three fillies who were glancing down at their saddlebags of candy. The pink pony just shrugged it off. “What! Those things are good!”</p><p class="double">Zecora held up a hoof, and hissed, “Beware you ponies, quiet now, for danger lurks beneath these boughs. A manticore lives within this range, to work around we must arrange.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood frowned. “But in that case, why bring us to this dreadful place?”</p><p class="double">“To foolishness do not give voice, this way would not have been my choice. Nightmare&#039;s spells took us astray, this path returns the quickest way.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armour said, “Very well, we need to be ready. If you can fight melee, come to the front, non-combatants in the middle, magic users and ranged fighters to the back. Twilight, you shield to the rear, I&#039;ll take the front.”</p><p class="double">Alongside him lined up Big Mac and his sister, with Rainbow Dash flying overhead. Zecora came up with them, and so did Blueblood, just behind. Shining Armour asked the zebra if she was sure she wanted to be up front.</p><p class="double">“You still need me to be your guide, I can&#039;t exactly run and hide. If manticores we have to fix, this zebra has a few old tricks.” She gave a knowing grin.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s all well and good, but Blueblood?” Rainbow Dash asked, rather unkindly.</p><p class="double">“I may not be Royal Guard, but I am quite skilled at Polo.” Blueblood stated haughtily. </p><p class="double">“Polo?” Dash cackled.</p><p class="double">Blueblood plucked a cylinder from his designer saddlebags, which turned out to be the head of a Polo mallet. A flick and the shaft extended, and a ball followed it, floating up in the air above their heads. Blueblood gave a slight frown of concentration and the mallet blurred in an overhead circle that terminated in a double crack, the second of which was a tree branch snapping off neatly a hundred hooves away. “Polo.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shut her mouth, which had unaccountably dropped open, and she wasn&#039;t the only one. “Polo. Okay... works for me.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Rarity were at the back, and Twilight saw her friend was now looking at the Prince with a certain interest. She gave a small grin and a nudge to the white unicorn. “Thinking of taking up... polo?”</p><p class="double">“Huh... What?” Rarity shook her head slightly and said, “Oh nonsense Twilight, I was merely admiring his form.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I noticed that.” Really, this was too easy. </p><p class="double">“Oh, you!” Rarity blushed. “I just meant he does have a certain presence.”</p><p class="double">“Ohh! Does he have presents for all of us, or just Rarity?” Pinkie dropped back along side them in a manoeuvre that if it didn&#039;t violate the laws of physics, at least invited it out for dinner and a some heavy petting.</p><p class="double">“Pinkie dear, just drop it.” Rarity pleaded.</p><p class="double">“But I&#039;m not carrying anything! Well except for a couple of cakes, some party streamers, a dozen assorted balloons, a rubber chicken, an eye-patch, a ball, and a pair of fake Groucho spectacles. You know, the essentials.”</p><p class="double">The three fillies and Fluttershy were in the centre of the formation after some convincing by Dash that Scootaloo and Apple Bloom were forming &#039;a second line of defence&#039;.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle on the other hand was looking around nervously and asked Fluttershy. “This manticore, we won&#039;t run into it, will we? I mean with all these precautions, it&#039;s got to be pretty scary.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked none too confident herself, but she swallowed her fear and said, “Of course not Sweetie. Manticores need a large range to hunt in. The chances that it will be right on this edge of it&#039;s range, right in our path is...”</p><p class="double">There was a roar from up ahead. “... oh, my.”</p><p class="double">“Get ready, but stand firm every-pony!” Shining called out as the shadow of a manticore was silhouetted in the moonlight. “That means you too Rainbow Dash! Let it come to us if it&#039;s attacking! It can batter itself against my shield for a bit and then we&#039;ll see if it still wants to play.”</p><p class="double">His purple energy shield went up, creating a wall that covered the ponies out front. Blueblood raised his mallet, while Rainbow pawed the air and Applejack unslung her lasso. Big Mac just set himself, thorn claws digging deep in the dirt, and Zecora collected some powders from her saddlebags.</p><p class="double">They held there while the thing continued roaring and carrying on, but it didn&#039;t charge. Shining Armour asked Zecora, “Why isn&#039;t it attacking?” </p><p class="double">“I study such from far away, why acts it so I can not say.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow called out to it. “Well come on then, if you&#039;re coming!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy mumbled something, and Twilight, ready for it this time asked right away, “What was that Fluttershy?”</p><p class="double">It took several stutters and false starts, but she eventually managed, “I... I don&#039;t think it wants to attack us for being on it&#039;s range, I think it&#039;s hurt...”</p><p class="double">“So what do you suggest?” Twilight asked, as if she didn&#039;t know.</p><p class="double">“I could try and help it...”</p><p class="double">“Help it? Fluttershy, are you completely nuts?” Rainbow Dash called down.</p><p class="double">“N... no, completely terrified, but not nuts.” Fluttershy&#039;s voice steadied. “Please, he&#039;s in pain!”</p><p class="double">Shining had a sour expression. “I don&#039;t like sending any-pony in there alone...”</p><p class="double">Surprisingly, it was Big Macintosh who spoke up. “Begging your pardon sir, but every-pony knows Fluttershy&#039;s the best pony with animals. If she reckons she can do it, she can do it.”</p><p class="double">“So you think she can calm it down?”</p><p class="double">“Eyup!” The pony turned timber wolf nodded firmly.</p><p class="double">“Alright... but if that thing makes one wrong move, I want her hauled out of there fast. Twily, you cover that.”</p><p class="double">With that he opened a hole in his shield and Fluttershy walked forward. The manticore grew more frantic as she approached, but she trotted up to it without showing a trace of her earlier fear. She nudged it as it raised a paw as if to strike, and it instead showed the thorn in it. Looked like Nightmare Moon was running at least some old favourites.</p><p class="double">“Oh you poor kitty, you&#039;re just hurt. Now let me see that, this may sting, just a little...”</p><p class="double">It roared again as she plucked the thorn, and several ponies winced, but when they looked again it was cuddling her and licking her, making her mane an odd shape.</p><p class="double">It didn&#039;t attempt to attack or do anything as the party walked carefully past, and at the end Fluttershy finally untangled herself and rejoined the group.</p><p class="double">“Remarkable!” Shining Armour shook his head in honest amazement.</p><p class="double">“That were some mighty fine animal wrangling, Miss Fluttershy.” Big Macintosh added, and the butter yellow pegasus blushed, avoiding the big timber wolves gaze. “It was nothing, I just realised the poor thing needed a bit of kindness. Thank you for supporting me.”</p><p class="double">“My pleasure, miss.” He replied, and his eyes glowed with something more than a sickly green aura.</p><p class="double">Twilight was a bit surprised, after previous variations, it was a bit of a shock to see something following the base time-line. However, she made one change, when Fluttershy spit away the thorn, she captured it in a hoof sized ball of telekinetic energy just as it turned into smoke. She flashed the interior with intense sunlight and the smoke evaporated with a shriek. </p><p class="double">“That&#039;s one bit of Nightmare Moon that won&#039;t be reporting back on our progress.”</p><p class="double">They continued on deeper into the forest, and into the darkness. Clearly, as they&#039;d gotten closer to the castle, they were getting closer to the base-line route, and Nightmare Moon was doing the same. Which meant that she was likely to pull her old &#039;scary face&#039; routine next.</p><p class="double">As the darkness closed in Sweetie Belle quavered, “I can&#039;t see anything, I don&#039;t like this...”</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom replied, “I can see just fine, just keep next to me, okay?”</p><p class="double">Twilight lit her horn, and the other unicorns quickly followed suit, while Zecora threw up some powder that formed a greenish light ball hovering over them. It didn&#039;t do much more than light their immediate area, and made the shadows beyond it deeper, but at least it was something. </p><p class="double">Of course, right on cue, the trees around them seemed to twist and reshape themselves into terrible faces with gaping mouths of needle sharp teeth and empty eyes that promised nothing but an eternity of terror and despair. They seemed to move without actually moving, the way the horror that chased you in your deepest nightmares did, and every second you delayed would only make it more terrible when they captured you.</p><p class="double">Twilight could have covered herself with a shield against the fear they were casting, but that would have been cheating, as in-loop Twilight couldn&#039;t. Instead she put her considerable mental ability towards resisting. The other ponies weren&#039;t so able.</p><p class="double">The fillies were cowering in the centre of the clearing, utterly immobilised, and the adult ponies around her were no better, even the normally imperturbable Blueblood who was curled up in a fetal position, whimpering, “Not the blancmange!” over and over. The only other pony still resisting was Zecora, and even she appeared to be weakening. Of course, there was one exception.</p><p class="double">As expected, it was Pinkie who broke the spell, trotting right up to the nearest face and making faces right back. If anything, the fear effect was even stronger than usual, and Twilight was the only one near enough to her right mind to ask her what she was doing, triggering her song.</p><p class="double">It was actually a fascinating study, watching the power of the Element of Laughter push away the fear effect, and soon she had all the ponies trotting around and joining in the fun. The fillies took a particular pleasure in laughing away the evil faces, but even Blueblood took his part, sneering at them and calling them &#039;tawdry, shallow hoof-paintings with no depth or sub-text.&#039; before laughing them into non-existence.</p><p class="double">When the last of them was cleared away, Applejack asked Twilight, “What the hey were they?!”</p><p class="double">“Images imbued with raw fear. I said we needed to expect mental attacks. If they hadn&#039;t been stopped, we could have been trapped here, immobilised with fear until it was too late. Fortunately we had Laughter on our side.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re welcome!” Pinkie said brightly, bouncing past wearing the groucho spectacles.</p><p class="double">Zecora shook her head. “Never have I felt such fear, it made my wits quite disappear.”</p><p class="double">“All the same, I&#039;d prefer it if you could figure out a way to stop that happening again, Twily.” Shining Armour asked.</p><p class="double">“Now I&#039;ve seen it in action, I should be able to counter-spell, at least enough to give us a chance to resist.”</p><p class="double">They soon reached the shores of the wide river, churning and frothing. “Horse-feathers, you ground pounders are never going to get across that!” Dash exclaimed.</p><p class="double">“Can you teleport us in groups, Twily?” Shining Armour asked.</p><p class="double">“Not safely, not with the amount of chaotic magic in the air. We might end up in the middle of the river instead.”</p><p class="double">“Uh guys, we&#039;ve got a bigger problem...”</p><p class="double">Steven Magnet, the river serpent was heading downriver towards them at a rate of knots, but rather than bewailing his lost moustache, he was raging against the ones who had stolen it.</p><p class="double">“What the hay? We didn&#039;t do anything to his moustache!” cried out Applejack. </p><p class="double">Twilight was already casting magical scans. It seemed Nightmare Moon was playing cute again. “Nightmare Moon&#039;s cast another symbol on him, a Symbol of Wrath, but she&#039;s cast it on his eyes!”</p><p class="double">“So counter-spell it!” called out Shining Armour as he raised a shield to take the blow of a claw.</p><p class="double">“I will but I need every-pony to hold his head still so I can aim! Bring his head down to the ground!”</p><p class="double">Her telekinesis would have been enough, but that would have required going to a higher power than she wanted to risk, besides, casting the counter-spell at the same time would be awkward. Still, her purple energy wrapped around his head, joined by Rarity&#039;s and even Blueblood&#039;s. Shining was still doing shield duty. Fluttershy, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo formed a cheering section, albeit in Fluttershy&#039;s case a very quiet one. &#039;woo hoo!&#039;</p><p class="double">Rainbow landed on Steven&#039;s neck and tried to push him down, while Applejack launched her lasso, wrapping it around his muzzle. Apple Bloom and Big Macintosh grabbed the free end of the lasso and helped pull.down on it, but the river serpent was still resisting. Then Zecora whipped out a sling and whirled it around, launching a puffball at Steven&#039;s face. It exploded into fine powder, and seemed to stun the river serpent for a moment, enough time for the combined efforts of the ponies to pull his head down level with Twilight.</p><p class="double">She released her hold and fired the dispel charm right into his eyes. They glowed for a second, then lost their red tint, turning puzzled. The waters calmed as he stopped thrashing about. “Mi may, my moo Mi ma a mp mrnd my mummle.”</p><p class="double">Twilight signalled to Applejack to release the lasso, and the river serpent was free to speak. “My goodness, I don&#039;t know what came over me. There I was minding my own business, and suddenly this tacky little cloud comes past and rips of half my beautiful moustache clean off. Not only that but I was suddenly absolutely enraged!”</p><p class="double">He sniffled, “I&#039;m sorry if I scared you all, but I really wasn&#039;t myself. But my moustache is still absolutely ruined. I look absolutely horrid!”</p><p class="double">He started wailing, and the thrashing of his tail roiled the waters again.</p><p class="double">Dash looked incredulous “Really? Suck it up, you&#039;re a dragon!”</p><p class="double">“Dash, how can you be so callous!” Rarity exclaimed. “Look at his lovely luminescent scales, his expertly coiffed mane, even the fabulous manicure on his claws...”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s true, it&#039;s true...” The river serpent was calming down.</p><p class="double">“So much effort put into looking his best, and it&#039;s all ruined without his beautiful moustache.”</p><p class="double">That set Steven off again, worse than before. Rarity declaimed, “I can not let such a crime against fabulousity go uncorrected!” </p><p class="double">She plucked a scale from his skin, eliciting an ouch of pain and a query from the hapless dragon, and lifted it over her own tail...</p><p class="double">“STOP!” Blueblood stepped forward. “Miss Rarity, there&#039;s a shortage of perfect tails in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours. I find myself in agreement with you, this fashion crime can not go uncorrected. However, while gold and purple is a bold statement, wouldn&#039;t all gold be better?”</p><p class="double">Rarity was honestly shocked. “Prince Blueblood, are you offering what I think you are offering? Your tail is magnificent too. Are you really offering it as a replacement?”</p><p class="double">“It should be, I have the best stylists in Canterlot work on it daily.” Blueblood took a noble pose. “However, needs must, and you&#039;ve forgotten, I am <i>Prince</i> Blueblood, trend setter of the Canterlot social elite. If I can&#039;t make short tails for stallions the must have fashion of the season, I&#039;ll turn in my membership card for the Canterlot Country Club.”</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s eyes sparkled with unshed tears, and she lifted the scale, aiming carefully. Shick! A wave of gold dropped to the floor, to be caught by her telekinesis. The dragon had calmed down again fascinated at the drama unfolding below, and it was the work of a moment for Rarity to expertly weave the new gold into the existing stub so expertly it seemed a single set of whiskers.</p><p class="double">Steven examined himself and went into transports of delight. “My moustache, ohohohoho! It&#039;s back, and it&#039;s perfect!”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled up at him. “You look smashing.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is cool and all, but we really need to get across the river soonest!” Dash exclaimed with a huff.</p><p class="double">“Oh, allow me!” Steven laid his coils across the river forming a bridge. As they reached the other side, Rarity turned to Blueblood,eyes glowing warmly. “When we get back, I&#039;ll do my best to clean up that bob. I may not be a Canterlot stylist, but I can at least get it looking presentable. That was a truly noble thing you did, your highness.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, way to take one for the team, your highness-ship.” Applejack added.</p><p class="double">Shining Armour shook his head in disbelief. “I didn&#039;t think you had it in you.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood actually looked slightly embarrassed at the complements. “To be honest, neither did I.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.8 (Lord of Bones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the letter appeared in a flash of green flame and ash, Luna saw her sister reach out with her magic and undo the seal. Celestia unfurled the letter with a smile, which quickly turned into a look of incredulous astonishment, right before she vanished in a burst of purple light.</p><p class="double">Somewhat bemused by her sister&#039;s departure, the Night Princess levitated the letter over and read it out loud.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">You know I value the lessons you&#039;ve taught me over the years, but you simply must stop secluding yourself in that stuffy old throne room. Princess, there is more to life than bureaucracy, so I&#039;m inviting you over for the Ponyville Winter Wrap-up, and I have a more important task for you: make some friends.</p><p class="double">Your Student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">P.S. I expect a report on what you&#039;ve learned.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.9 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack eyed the necklace dubiously. If it hadn&#039;t been the glowing image of Celestia herself that&#039;d appeared to give her the thing - and done the same for four other mares in Ponyville - Applejack would&#039;ve assumed it was a prank. In horrible taste, no less, what with the whole <i>Nightmare Moon Is Real</i> thing going on.</p><p class="double">But the five of them had managed to get through the Everfree Forest with the power of these things, and now were facing the big bad alicorn herself. Using their necklaces separate hadn&#039;t done the trick, so where was only one thing left to do!</p><p class="double">&quot;C&#039;mon ya&#039;ll, let our powers combine!&quot; Applejack declared, &quot;EARTH!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;FIRE!&quot; Pinkie Pie exclaimed, confetti somehow firing from her mane and tail at the same time.</p><p class="double">&quot;WIND!&quot; Rainbow Dash cried.</p><p class="double">&quot;WATER!&quot; Rarity added.</p><p class="double">&quot;...um...Heart?&quot; Fluttershy offered.</p><p class="double">Their powers formed a glowing rainbow sphere in the air, and a purple alicorn princess in fancy dress flew out of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;By your powers combined...&quot; she announced, &quot;I am PRINCESS TWILIGHT!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and nopony else suspects a thing,&quot; Celestia said, grinning at her partner-in-crime, &quot;I certainly couldn&#039;t have pulled this off without you, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Glad I could help,&quot; Twilight replied, grinning back. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;AAAAAA!&quot; Babs shot out the door and galloped down the stairs. &quot;CHANGELING!&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom blinked. Then she glanced back at her wings and sighed. &quot;Ah have got ta stop ascending in mah sleep...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mayor Mare.&quot; The pony at the bar drained her mug. &quot;It&#039;s literally my name, Macintosh. Mayor. Mare. I mean, some loops I&#039;m also Ivory Scroll, but... well, that&#039;s the thing, isn&#039;t it? Every loop, I&#039;m stuck behind a desk and even knowing what&#039;s going to happen, even preparing for it, I get the same documents to sign, the same fiscal reports... I love this town, and I love running it, but the same thing over and over again feels...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pointless?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare nodded sadly. &quot;How can I serve ponies when.... it all just gets washed away. Phhhfft.&quot; She waved a hoof. &quot;And... really. I don&#039;t want to be famous. I just want to be... useful.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh nodded to himself. &quot;Ah can understand where yer coming from. But... think bout it like this. Mah lil&#039; sis usually sets up her lab ta do science of some sort or other. If she needed ta worry bout zoning permits, she&#039;d be champing her bit, but... well, she don&#039;t need to, thanks ta you. And there was that time when you and Twilight pulled off tha sovereign nation of Libraria... Ah don&#039;t know if you were awake then, but... Mah point is, we really do appreciate you. And tha fact is, we&#039;re all kinda responsible fer giving other loopers a place ta relax. We may not say it often, but.... well, Pinkie always pulls a party fer you every time tha election rolls round, and she means it as one big thank you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I.... appreciate that, Mac. I really do.&quot;</p><p class="double">He smiled. &quot;Say, did Ah ever tell ya about tha time Ah was a princess?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora was...</p><p class="double">Incensed? Perhaps. But it would be more accurate to say she was actually quite hurt by Ponyville&#039;s actions this day. Even though the Mayor had calmed the screaming crowd and insisted--with papers that the zebra didn&#039;t remember signing--that she was a fully licensed ranger, the odd suspicious glance still cut at her.</p><p class="double">The purple pony helping her shop smiled sympathetically. &quot;Hey, Zec, I know how it is. A lot of ponies look at me and only remember the town drunk.&quot; She shook her head, sighing and indicating another booth with a subtle hoof movement. &quot;At least all your friends are looping. Me, well... I have to live with my daughter... although, I did see my sister run off to Sweet Apple Acres, so she might have started.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am afraid you must forgive me, but your sibling eludes my memory.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheerilee,&quot; Berry Punch explained. &quot;The schoolteacher? We&#039;re estranged, but.... well, even when the loops say we aren&#039;t sisters, we usually have a past together.&quot; She cut herself off as the boothkeeper turned to them, and Zecora noticed the subtle shift in her face as she shifted from speaking to a looper to speaking to a normal pony. &quot;Excuse me, my friend needs some herbs? Here&#039;s a list.&quot;</p><p class="double">The boothkeeper raised a suspicious eyebrow. At least it wasn&#039;t fearful cowering. Still... although Zecora knew the pony couldn&#039;t remember everything that had... not happened yet, his distrust hurt.</p><p class="double">Berry noticed and patted her shoulder. &quot;Don&#039;t worry. Near as I can tell, everyone who&#039;s looping is Awake this time. I don&#039;t know why, but you can probably ask Fluttershy when she gets back. She lives closest to the Everfree, after all...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">49.13 (Lord of Bones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Your Highness? Have you seen our daughter?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s face fell as she turned from the distraught Bearers to meet Twilight Velvet and Night Light. The unicorn couple peered at her worriedly, and Celestia wished she had answers. Her faithful student had vanished after the dressing-down she&#039;d been given, and while Chrysalis had been unmasked – by a disoriented Blueblood, no less, who&#039;d botched a teleport and ended up in his cousin&#039;s prison – Twilight herself was nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="double">The familiar appearance of a Friendship Report drew a sigh of relief from the alicorn, which wasn&#039;t unnoticed by the smaller pair. Unfurling the scroll, she began to read out:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Dear Princess Celestia, </i></p><p class="double"><i>If you&#039;re reading this, I have gone evil-&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia just stared at the words numbly, as though in disbelief. &quot;I – <i>I have gone evil, possibly due to toying with eldritch arcane secrets beyond mortal comprehension or a brutal heartbreak at the hooves at the ponies I thought I could trust the most. </i></p><p class="double"><i>Following narrative tropes, I may have chosen to alter my name to something more evocative and ominous, like Dusk Eternal or Endless Eclipse. I will also have gathered allies, like corrupting Princess Luna into Nightmare Moon, breaking Discord&#039;s prison, stirring Sombra from his tomb and summoning Sunset Shimmer to serve as my lieutenant.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">There was a hitch in the Sun Princess&#039;s throat as she finished the sentence. Horrified looks were being exchanged between Twilight&#039;s friends and family, and the Alicorn forced herself to soldier on.</p><p class="double"><i>If Spike isn&#039;t there when you&#039;re reading this, he&#039;ll be with me as my final link to all that is good and pure about friendship, loyal to the end but curtailing my darkest moments. Also following narrative tropes, he may end up sacrificing himself to save my life from you or one of the girls-&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Rarity choked back a sob.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;The act of which would see me spiral deeper and deeper into my hatred and darkness as I numbly cradle the still body of my oldest and most faithful friend while you stare in horror. Undoubtedly, this will cause me to desire nothing more than the most terrible revenge imaginable, and so I&#039;ll confront you with Nightmare Moon and Sunset Shimmer, so that you can brood on the irony of being undone by your greatest failures.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your ex-faithful ex-student,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Endless Eclipse, Lady of the Twilight, Queen of the Dusk and the Dawn. </i></p><p class="double">The letter fell from Celestia&#039;s telekinetic grip as the Sunbringer stared numbly ahead. Twilight Velvet snatched the parchment and breathlessly read out the last few sentences.</p><p class="double"><i>P.S. If you&#039;ve received this letter and I&#039;m not evil...well, you&#039;ll know to take precautions, won&#039;t you?</i> </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>50.1 (Misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Look, Applejack, you can&#039;t remain scared of them forever,&quot; Twilight told her friend as they both casually ambled through the apple trees on a sunny Sunday day.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, Twi. It&#039;s just that I&#039;m a normal down-to-earth earth pony,&quot; the orange farm pony punctuated her statement with a hoof stomp, causing a small pillar of earth to jut out of the ground, &quot;and they are just so gosh darn plum loco!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s not what I meant,&quot; the purple unicorn shook her head, &quot;I fairly sure Yggdrasil, the multi-verse, or whatever has a perverse sense of humor. It took me countless loops before I was over my fear of snakes, but until that happened, the loops kept doing things to me. I was placed in situations. Snakey situations.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath as she remembered, &quot;There was the time I was the archeologist Twilight Jones, a chakra ninja named Anko who had a snake summoning contract and used them in her martial arts, and a flight attendant on a airplane that was filling up of dangerous and venomous snakes. I think I finally broke out of my fear when I awoke as the Hogwarts basilisk.&quot;</p><p class="double">AJ stared at her friend and anchor, &quot;And how did that turn out?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, &quot;Well, despite the fact that those kinds of basilisks are actually legless lizards related to wyrms and not real snakes at all; once I calmed down from my endless freak out, I asked Harry in snake speak for a house elf to bring me some food. Then I, uh, sequestered myself in the library.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, figures,&quot; Applejack smirked.</p><p class="double">&quot;My point is that until you overcome this fear, you&#039;ll get placed in more and more compromising situations until you Awake as one of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack just shivered at the thought, &quot;But what do you recon I can do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well it isn&#039;t consistent, but occasionally in some loops - including this one, there is an expert I can introduce you to. If you&#039;re willing to wait until the changeling invasion, that is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose I can do that,&quot; the earth pony looked at her friend, &quot;Thanks, Twi. It&#039;s just that with the loops, I&#039;ve seen and done so much. I shouldn&#039;t be letting this bother me so much, but I just can&#039;t help it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, Applejack. It&#039;s what friends are for.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Listen every pony,&quot; Twilight stood on top of a small crate in the Ponyville train station. It was the day after she and her friends came back from Canterlot. &quot;I know you are all worried about the changelings. We stopped their invasion in the capitol, and we can deal with any remaining ones here. If it would make you all feel better, I can cast a spell that will reveal any hidden forms. If there are changelings hiding amongst you, you will see them. Okay, here goes.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a loud cheer as Twilight&#039;s horn lit up. A burst of magic enveloped the crowd and quickly spread out through the entire town.</p><p class="double">Only one pony&#039;s form changed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, kelp weed!&quot; Lyra Heartstrings cursed as the seapony flapped and floundered on the ground.</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s mouth opened in shock. The air noticeably dried as a sphere of water formed around Lyra&#039;s lower body and tail, growing until she was able to right herself.</p><p class="double">The sea-green seapony looked around at the assembled crowd members before her gaze stopped at a smiling Twilight and her friends. Only Applejack had a startled look on her face, &quot;Judging by your expressions, I&#039;m going to guess and say some of you haven&#039;t seen a mer-mare before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, every pony. I&#039;ve got this,&quot; Twilight said as she, her friends, and Lyra walked (or rode a water ball) into town.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Every pony was clustered in Lyra&#039;s house. For a few moments there was silence, before Lyra broke it, &quot;So, I suppose you have some questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie jumped up like a school filly with one hoof raised in the air, &quot;Oh! Oh me! My question is, do you like parties?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Pinkie. Especially your parties,&quot; Lyra answered without any pause.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay!&quot; the pink pony blew a noise maker and then promptly sat down, &quot;I&#039;m done.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nudged Applejack. The orange earth pony coughed and then asked, &quot;So, er.. You&#039;re a seapony. How in tarnation did that happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra rolled her eyes, &quot;Well, when a mommy mer-mare and a daddy sea-stallion like each other very much, and the daddy agrees to take care of the sea foals while the mommy goes out to fight...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not like that!&quot; Applejack snorted, &quot;I meant why were you here, in Ponyville, hiding out as a unicorn?&quot;</p><p class="double">The seapony sighed, &quot;Because I didn&#039;t want to constantly receive reactions like yours. I grew up in Oceanapollis, which is fairly close to the front lines. I decided that I liked music more than mayhem and had a sea-witch change me into a unicorn. Then I attended the Canterlot Royal Academy of Music specializing in lyres, harps, guitars, and stringed instruments. After that, I moved to Ponyville because it&#039;s not as mind-numbingly boring as the capitol. And I also met Bonbon here. So everything was coming up Lyra, right until Twilight&#039;s spell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! You went to CRAM? One of my little sisters went there. Or at least sometimes, she&#039;s my little sister. Hold on,&quot; Pinkie Pie tilted her head, remembering, &quot;Yep, Octavia&#039;s one of my sisters this time around.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight stopped staring at her random pink friend, &quot;Oh I get it! That&#039;s why you sometimes sit so strange. Because it reminds you of how you were aligned as a seapony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Lyra slowly shook her head, &quot;I have to sit like that to play the lyre. It&#039;s like stretching. If I don&#039;t do it frequently enough, it starts to become uncomfortable when I perform.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Pinkie said sadly, &quot;I thought it had something to do with your fascination with humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know about humans!?&quot; Lyra had a mad glint in her eyes while her tiny fins fluttered excitedly, &quot;Mythical technologically-advanced apes from another dimension? They have hands! They&#039;re like five little legs attached to one long leg!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what I said! Hand bump!&quot; Pinky spoke up and held out her hoof. A tendril of water shaped like a fist lightly impacted it.</p><p class="double">Lyra continued, &quot;I heard that there was a magic mirror that could let a pony enter the human dimension. Who knows what amazing mysteries lie beyond?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Boring, boring High School,&quot; Twilight said before her brain caught up with her mouth. She gave a sheepish smile as all the other ponies started staring at her, &quot;Uh, I mean, how did you convince a sea-witch to change your form? I&#039;ve read that they tend to be proud, manipulative, and stubborn.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra looked at her and slowly spoke, &quot;Because. I. Am. A. Seapony. Everything under the water is utterly terrified of us, hippocampi; or wants to kill us horribly. Usually both. I just asked nicely.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So you just asked?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I may have been casually tying her electric attack eels into balloon animal shapes while I was doing so, but yes. I just asked. And smiled.&quot; Lyra gave a wide, toothy, and very, very disturbing grin.</p><p class="double">Applejack whinnied slightly in fear, before reigning herself in.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have a question,&quot; Bonbon, who until now had been staring quietly at her roommate, spoke up, &quot;At which point did you think casually saying, &#039;Hey Bonbonbonbonbon, I&#039;m actually a seapony in disguise! What time is dinner?&#039; to be a valid way of letting me in on your secret?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See Applejack,&quot; Twilight said while the roommates were arguing, &quot;She&#039;s just like any other pony. Nothing to be scared of.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose so, Twi.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s why I&#039;m locking you in here for the night.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s fair I suppose,&quot; Applejack said while staring at the seapony, who had now grabbed her roommate in a water tendril and was holding her upside-down in mid-air. Bonbon didn&#039;t seem the least bit put out and just continued arguing right back while in her new position. Then Applejack suddenly registered what Twilight had said, &quot;Wait! What? No Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, AJ. It&#039;s called immersion therapy. See you tomorrow.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack tried to grab hold of the unicorn, but was too late as Twilight and all her friends vanished in a purple burst of light. She slowly looked back at the two ponies in the same room with her, who were now both staring at her. She gave a timid little wave. Lyra gave a matching wave with her little fin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now let me down so I can start cooking for three,&quot; Bonbon spoke up. She then blinked and gave a wry smile at Lyra, &quot;And I suppose I need to find you a stock pot or something to sleep in.&quot;</p><p class="double">The seapony blinked in realization, &quot;Ugh, I forgot to ask Twilight to change me back into a unicorn. So Applejack, you want to go on an undersea adventure with me to track down a sea-witch?&quot;</p><p class="double">The farm pony rapidly shook her head no. Then she stopped and spoke, &quot;I think I&#039;ll go help Bonbon with the cooking.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh fine,&quot; Lyra huffed. Then she took another look at the frightened farm pony and sighed, &quot;Do you want me to show you how to make the tastiest seaweed salad ever? Sliced apples are one of the ingredients.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack thought about it and then nodded. She was going to have to overcome her fear sometime and it looked like Lyra was making an effort to help her, &quot;I.. I&#039;d like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great!&quot; Lyra smiled as she rolled on her water-ball into the kitchen ahead of the earth pony, &quot;I&#039;m just glad you didn&#039;t ask if the Heartstrings part of my name refers to actual severed hearts.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack froze in mid-step, her ears laid back flat on her head and her eyes opened wide with fear.</p><p class="double">&quot;That was a joke,&quot; came a cheerful voice from the kitchen.</p><p class="double">Slowly, ever so slowly, Applejack put one hoof in front of the other and walked through the door. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Bonbon stormed into the library, slamming down a letter. &quot;Alright, how much to send this through your dragon?! Celestia&#039;s making a big mistake, and--&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Bonbon, check the hive mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony blinked, her rant completely derailed. &quot;Check the-- check... <i>you knew?!</i>&quot; She pointed at the librarian. &quot;You&#039;re one of them! You&#039;ve been feeding off Celestia for--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I&#039;m not a changeling. Just...&quot; The librarian facehooved. &quot;Just trust me, the truth is complicated and unbelievable and you really should check the hive mind.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;...You&#039;re brainwashed!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...<i>Celestia</i> is brain--!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bonbon sat down. &quot;I don&#039;t see how Chrysalis could have suddenly become reasonable! It must be some sort of trick--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Time loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Check the hive mind, okay? You can pull out and run if I&#039;m wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Bonbon stared off into the distance, Twilight prepared some sugary tea and set the tray out. It wasn&#039;t long before her guest snapped out of her trance and collapsed into the couch.</p><p class="double">&quot;....that... what?&quot; she managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re always surprised,&quot; Twilight commented. &quot;Well, at least when you&#039;re a changeling. No you&#039;re not looping and, well, the changeling thing varies too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I just...&quot; Bonbon waved a hoof. &quot;She just... and.... what? That doesn&#039;t work...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tea?&quot; The librarian nudged a cup forward. &quot;Oh, and since you are a changeling, you get free access to Macintosh&#039;s bar. Lots of changelings have trouble adjusting to the sudden shift.&quot; She giggled. &quot;Sorry, bad joke.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.3 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Luna trotted up to the statue of Discord, which crumbled as she approached. The dust reformed into a purple alicorn pony who waved a hoof in greeting, then gave the pedestal a very dirty look with glowing yellow eyes, causing it to regenerate a replacement statue out of sheer embarrassment. She cricked her neck and flexed her wings. &quot;Awakening as Discord, now there&#039;s something new.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Be there any other loopers present? My sister for certes not, but I may have missed some-pony.&quot; Luna looked around to check no-pony was near, even as her other senses confirmed it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, looks like it&#039;s just you and me.&quot; Twilight glanced up at the starlit sky. &quot;And unless you&#039;ve been rearranging things, I&#039;d say we&#039;re within a dozen years of your banishment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That doth check with mine own reading of the dates.&quot; Luna grinned, &quot;Not that I will allow it to happen this time. You have plans?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I thought I&#039;d hole up somewhere for a few centuries and give this chaos magic a thorough study. It&#039;s one thing to have studied it from the outside, another to have it to hoof. Of course, if you need anything, all you have to do is ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, good Twilight.&quot; The lunar mare grinned. &quot;However, I have a scheme of mine own. As it was before, my sister&#039;s day doth garner all the attention, while my night languishes unappreciated. This time, I have a better solution than throwing an epic temper tantrum and being banished to the moon...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The night had turned to day, by Royal decree, and the two princesses were enjoying a meal together, for Celestia it was breakfast, for Luna supper.</p><p class="double">Over the remains of a slice of cake, Celestia asked, &quot;Luna, I was wondering about some of the initiatives you are sponsoring through the Night Court. Funding for magical research into better light sources, later opening hours for taverns and theatres, and a series of art exhibitions and poetry commissions?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I&#039;m inviting a number of our more famous artists to render some of my night skies in their varying styles. I may even hazard a painting or two myself. My true canvas is unfortunately wiped clean with each dawn. T&#039;would be nice to have something less ephemeral. As for the funding, it comes from my own purse, so it should not be a charge on the treasury. I dids&#039;t capture and render down a metal rich asteroid of some hundred thousand tons to acquire the necessary precious metals.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But to what end?&quot; Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dear sister, I know how busy the Day court gets, indeed that is part of the problem. Even so, surely you must be aware of a certain inequity in how day and night are perceived. Ponies appreciate your day, but for the most part they sleep through my night. While I also have my duties as Dream Guardian to keep my occupied, but over the last few decades I have come to feel diminished, as if my efforts were of less worth than your own. My Night Court is almost empty, while your overflows.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia made a moue of disgust. &quot;You can have them, some of the drivel I have to put up with from some nobles... But I had no idea you felt that way!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tis only recently that I was able to put the creeping malaise I felt into words. Had I continued to suffer it without respite, I don&#039;t know what would have happened. However, I have a solution. All these measures are to engage our subjects, to enable them to appreciate the night. Better light sources, cheaper and more powerful than beeswax candles and oil lamps or expensive mage lights, will give ponies greater freedom to thrive and play after your sun sets. Not just mages, but alchemists and even natural philosophers are involved. And of course, if we can promulgate those habits to the courts, I can help take more of the load off your shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;The other part of the equation is to give ponies things to do. If they can enjoy themselves of an evening, they will stay up later, and of necessity be awake to enjoy my night. While currently it will simply be a matter of enabling existing entertainments, I have the idea for something I call a Night Club. It would combine elements of a festival with musicians and dancing, combined with refreshments and places to eat and relax. Though I may sponsor some night-time festivals and provide meteor showers for a truly spectacular entertainment first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Despite the fact that she&#039;d planned it all out, she found herself getting excited. &quot;The arts I&#039;m funding will help raise awareness of my night sky, and hopefully get ponies to appreciate it more. I have a side project related to light research to develop better lenses and drafting methods, so I can try and popularise astronomy, beyond it&#039;s mundane uses in magic and alchemy...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled, &quot;My goodness, you certainly seem to have a lot of ideas...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The choice was simple, mope about it, or do something to change it.&quot; Luna replied with a flip of her ethereal mane. &quot;I hope it meets with your approval.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I wish you the best of luck.&quot; </p><p class="double">Luna knew her sister well enough to know that while honest, her sister didn&#039;t quite believe that it would be as easy as Luna had made it out to be, and she was right after a fashion. But Luna had one big advantage, she already knew what would work, and could guide things to progress things far more quickly than Celestia imagined. And if she kicked off an industrial revolution a few centuries early, so what? Then things would get really interesting. She gave an unfeigned yawn, &quot;But for now I must to bed. May your day go well, dear sister.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was late. She&#039;d gotten even more involved in her studies of chaos magic than expected, and completely missed the last few centuries, stuck away in a Geofront under the Macintosh mountains, where some of her more energetic experiments wouldn&#039;t scare anyone. She&#039;d had messages from Luna that things were going well, but they&#039;d been short on details. When she&#039;d finally checked the time, she realised she&#039;d missed her friends being born, and it was almost time for what would have been the thousandth Summer Sun Celebration after Luna&#039;s banishment in the original timeline.</p><p class="double">She teleported to the railroad near Ponyville, on a sunny afternoon, only to find it wasn&#039;t the normal twin tracks. A single rail floated above the ground on wide spaced cloud supports, and as she watched a mag-lev train whooshed past almost silently. Looking back towards Canterlot, she saw that as well as the familiar castle city, the lower parts of the mountain were built-up with sky-scrapers that were cunningly built into the rock to avoid ruining the sky-line.</p><p class="double">At least Ponyville looked much the same as she approached, and she could sense some of the others were Awake. She entered Sugar Cube corner in something of a daze, having seen Lyra in her usual spot, but editing what sounded like her lyre music on a thaumo-electronic laptop computer with a holo-projection screen. </p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight!&quot; Pinkie appeared in front of her with a cup-cake. &quot;Every-pony was wondering where you were!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m wondering where I am too!&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;Is the Summer Sun Celebration going on as usual?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, silly! Princess Celestia is coming to the Summer Sun Celebration, but Princess Luna can&#039;t make it, she&#039;s on the moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight felt a stab of disappointment. &quot;But I thought she&#039;d managed to avoid becoming Nightmare Moon this time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nighmare Moon?&quot; Pinkie Pie giggled. &quot;That&#039;s not why at all... c&#039;mon, it&#039;s time for sunset, it&#039;s easier to show you.&quot;</p><p class="double">They stepped outside to watch the sun go down, and Twilight noticed a number of small rectangles in the evening sky, light against the dusk. She sent out a magical probe to scan the sky... photo-thaumic power satellites, a string of them in orbit, and other satellites, with them, even a large space station with floating space-docks co-orbiting it. Then the moon rose, absent the shadow image of an alicorn, but with a scattering of stars inside its crescent.</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s dedicating the newest habitat dome at the Lunar colony in Mare Noctis, and then they&#039;ll do a joint holo-cast from Ponyville and the moon when they&#039;ll announce the launch date of the Celestial Voyager. Luna named it for her sister even though it was really Princess Luna&#039;s project. Dash has a place on the flight crew. They&#039;ll be visiting a dozen star systems this trip. I even baked a special &#039;You&#039;re going to go faster than light&#039; cake for them, but when I tried to carry it over to Dash&#039;s, I went a bit too fast and it attained infinite mass and vanished down a self-created singularity. I knew I&#039;d been too heavy on the unpaired quarks...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tuned Pinkie out as she stretched out her senses and enjoyed the view. Space industrialisation, Lunar colonies, interstellar travel, out far beyond the circle of fire light cast by Celestia&#039;s sun. It looked like Princess Luna might not be Nightmare Moon, but had her eternal night after all. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight would have sighed if she could.</p><p class="double">Her loop memories were vague fragments, but even worse was the fact that she was in complete sensory deprivation. She couldn&#039;t see, smell, hear, feel... even her magic was stymied, with only her connection to the Elements to tell her that her friends were Awake. She couldn&#039;t move, or rather... didn&#039;t feel anything <i>to</i> move. Which was really weird.</p><p class="double"><i>Buck this.</i> Twilight Sparkle summoned the element of magic and, relying mostly on faith, cast the spell for ascension.</p><p class="double">Instantly the world overwhelmed her with the cool touch of air, the light of the sun, the scents of grass and burnt out homes, the faint creaking of ruined wood... she shook her head, taking a moment to get her bearings and focus on the world around her.</p><p class="double">Which apparently consisted of posed skeletons in a half ruined Canterlot.</p><p class="double">&quot;....oooookay, this is... disturbing...&quot; Twilight poked out with her magic, carefully examining the skeletons; she winced when she found a soul-lock in each one, preventing the ponies inside from truly dying. &quot;Ah. Right. Going to have to apply regeneration magic-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Live? Alive!&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple alicorn spun around, catching sight of a wild-maned black pony hopping eagerly over the rubble. &quot;See?! See?! I told you, sister! I told you they would be alive, so HA!&quot; The crazed pony pointed mockingly at the largest of the skeletons, which Twilight belatedly realized had both wings and a horn. &quot;Ha ha. Ha. HA!&quot; She whirled around and grinned madly as she galloped over to Twilight, jamming her muzzle into the anchor&#039;s face. &quot;So pony pony pony, you come back because you like me right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled calmly, pulling on her psychology training and patting the pony in front of her. &quot;Of <i>course</i> I like you dear. I loved to look up at the stars every night-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the moon, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yes, the moon was one of my biggest inspirations!&quot; She sighed, sadly. &quot;Alas, dying does terrible things to memory. What exactly happened here?&quot;</p><p class="double">The black alicorn giggled. &quot;Made the ponies see my moon. Made it BIG! One night, really big moon. Oh, but I put it back after,&quot; she quickly reassured. &quot;And I even started raising the sun after sister fell asleep! Bad lazy sister. Bad.&quot; She sapped the large skeleton and glared. &quot;Mean too. Had all these ponies locked up and wanted them to send me away again – WAIT! You have the bad star!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes up to see what... Luna? Nightmare moon? Whoever she was was pointing at. &quot;Oh. I needed that to come back. I&#039;ll make it go away.&quot; She slipped the Element of Magic into her subspace pocket. &quot;See? Gone. Can I bring back the others now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...alright.&quot; The black alicorn backed up warily. &quot;Um... when you&#039;re done... can we play? I&#039;d like to play with another pony. These ponies don&#039;t play very well, except that one.&quot; She pointed at a wide-hipped earth pony skeleton with a larger grin then any other. &quot;That one always has fun games.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...sure thing. We&#039;ll... play.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.5 (LordofBones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;TWILIGHT SPARKLE!&quot; Celestia roared out. The guards, Bearers and her own nephew flinched back at the scorching heat of her anger, but the unicorn herself, who&#039;d just run in after vanishing the instant she entered Canterlot, was too busy wrestling Princess Cadance to the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike, the tranquillizers! HURRY!&quot;</p><p class="double">Gulping, the little dragon hurled the syringe towards his caretaker/sister-figure/business partner. Grabbing the Alicorn of Love in a headlock, the lavender mare seized the syringe in her telekinetic grip and jabbed it in. The pink alicorn shrieked, before her struggles began to die down as the chemical did its work, and soon the Queen of the Changelings was peacefully asleep on the floor of the room.</p><p class="double">Twilight brushed the sweat off her fringe. &quot;Well, that&#039;s the last one. Now, about my payment...&quot; She looked meaningfully at Blueblood.</p><p class="double">The Prince nodded and levitated the sealed envelope with his personal seal stamped on it over to Spike. &quot;A cheque for fifty thousand bits, plus expenses. Are you sure that&#039;s the last of them?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Bearer of Magic nodded. &quot;We cleaned them out pretty thoroughly. Make an appointment with Spike if you want me to do a second run through the place.&quot; She turned around, and jolted back at the look on her mentor&#039;s face. &quot;Princess Celestia, I didn&#039;t know you were there! I&#039;m really sorry, but I&#039;m kinda busy, so we&#039;ll have to catch up later.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s jaw opened and closed soundlessly, as her student, still faithful but no longer as reverential, levitated Spike over. &quot;What&#039;s next on the schedule?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s see...&quot; Spike flipped open a notebook and began reciting; &quot;You have an appointment in two hours with the Minotaur Council about some boats disappearing out the coast; then the Storm King of Griffonia wants to see you in the evening about getting rid of something haunting his youngest daughter; Grogar&#039;s offering two hundred thousand bits for the safe return of his Bell – that&#039;s tomorrow, by the way; and Zecora&#039;s hiring you for some ingredient hunting near Tartarus.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If we hurry, we can make it to the Tauros States in an hour!&quot; gasped Twilight as she ran out of the room, leaving her speechless friends and mentor. Blueblood shrugged and turned to leave. &quot;If there&#039;s nothing else...&quot; he trailed off as his guards opened the door for him, only for it to be shut tight again by a golden glow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nephew, what was all that about paying Twilight?&quot; Celestia demanded, too frazzled to be polite.</p><p class="double">In response, Blueblood simply rolled his eyes and levitated a small newspaper clipping over. &quot;Don&#039;t you read the papers, Auntie?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Sun Princess just stared at the advert, mouthing the words incredulously. &quot;Twilight Sparkle...Professional Troubleshooter...Monster Hunter...Ancient Evils...Adventurer...appointments with Spike the Dragon...fee doubled if usage of Element of Magic is required?!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.6 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight giggled as Spike sent off her follow-up letter. If the Princess didn&#039;t want her to take the Nightmare Moon prophecy seriously, who was she to argue?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">My apologies for having bothered you earlier. I clearly have been working too hard if I ended up turning a bunch of old pony tales into an imminent threat to Equestria. Obviously, if there was anything to the prophecy, you&#039;d have known it and spent the last few years doing everything in your power to prepare, from alicorn level magic binders to specially trained troops and equipment. You wouldn&#039;t need the help of a student unicorn who&#039;s still learning magic. Spike says I over-reacted again, and I guess he&#039;s right.</p><p class="double">Thank you for organising for me to be the overseer for the Summer Sun Celebration in Ponyville. A few days in the country, away from my studies will do wonders for my stress level. It was nice of you to arrange for me to stay at the library, but I promise not to read anything more taxing than a Daring Doo novel. As for making friends, I thought I had done. There&#039;s Spike, my brother and Princess Cadence, and I hope, if it&#039;s not too presumptuous, yourself. But if you feel I need more, I shall do my best.</p><p class="double">P.S. I had a wonderful idea! Moon dancer invited me to a party this evening in the West castle courtyard. I was going to continue work on deciphering the old legends, but I realised it would be perfect practice in making friends, for when I go to Ponyville tomorrow. Besides, I think Spike has a crush on Moondancer, and he deserves a chance to have some fun too. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll make sure everything is packed and ready so I can leave for Ponyville on time. From the list, it doesn&#039;t seem like checking on things will take that long anyway.</p><p class="double">Your faithful student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia looked at the letter in consternation. It seemed Twilight had taken her instructions a bit too much to heart. For a moment she considered intervening, then decided against it. As long as Twilight was there in Ponyville, she would quickly come to change her mind and go find the Elements. Best not to meddle and make things worse.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?&quot; Nightmare Moon declaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I did, and I know who you are... Princess Celestia. I know I got all over-excited about those mouldy old prophecies, but don&#039;t you think this is a bit over the top?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; the nightmare actually looked confused, then enraged. &quot;You dare confuse me with my sun-loving sister? I am Nightmare Moon, returned from my exile after a thousand years, and now my night will last forever!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;With all due respect your highness, this isn&#039;t really the time for Nightmare Night pranks. Ponies are waiting for you to raise the sun... unless it&#039;s Princess Cadence under that disguise, but I don&#039;t believe Cadence would pull something like this. But then I didn&#039;t think you&#039;d pull something like this. Everypony at the palace knows your fondness for practical jokes...&quot;</p><p class="double">She raised a shield as Nightmare Moon flung lightning at her. &quot;PRINCESS! What are you... that could have hurt some-pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am not Celestia! I am NIGHTMARE MOON!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight called out to the Mayor, &quot;Get every-pony clear. Princess Celestia has had some kind of mental breakdown. She thinks she&#039;s the pony from the legend of the Mare in the Moon, my dredging up of the old stories must have triggered something...&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor acted even as she spoke. &quot;Of course, but what will you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Try and contain her while you get ponies to safety!&quot; Twilight called out, letting a pair of thick anklets she&#039;d been wearing all day unlatch and drop to the floor. &quot;Guards, assist her!&quot;</p><p class="double">She flung out shields and counter spells to block and neutralise the energy blasts of the raging Nightmare Moon, while manoeuvring around to get a clear shot at her legs. When she did, the anklets shot forward to clamp themselves around Nightmare Moon&#039;s fore-hooves. Instantly, her ethereal mane diminished and the bolts she’d been throwing fizzled.</p><p class="double">&quot;What... what have you done!&quot; she asked, staggering.</p><p class="double">&quot;Slapped magic limiters on you until you calm down.&quot; Twilight replied. She blushed, &quot;I came up with them when I started having accidental bursts of higher power recently... They feed off power surges above a certain level, so the more powerful the magic you throw at them, the stronger they are. Right now you&#039;re limited to the power levels of a filly unicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the sun rose and Princess Celestia appeared, looking almost as confused as Nightmare Moon. Twilight looked back and forth, feigning confusion of her own. &quot;Wait, what... okay, what&#039;s really going on? Princess?&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia sighed. Things had just gotten complicated.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.7</p><p class="double">“Hiya, Twilight!” Applejack said cheerfully. “Got a moment?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Twilight sat down on a hay bale. “How are things?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you know, same as usual.” Applejack punctuated the comment with a sharp rap on the grass with her hoof, resulting in the nearby apple trees fruiting in seconds. “Just a simple farmer, me. And speakin&#039; of farming, ah&#039;ve got something for you t&#039; try.”</p><p class="double">She plonked down a bottle between them. “You know that potato project ah had goin&#039;?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“Well, this is after bein&#039; potato cider. Made th&#039; same way as regular cider is made, just... with potatoes. And then ah let some ferment fer a bit, just t&#039; see what happened.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked slightly apprehensive, but shrugged. “Well, I suppose that&#039;s the point of experiments.”</p><p class="double">“Good on yer.” Applejack took out two shot glasses, and filled them with a glug of liquid. “Health.”</p><p class="double">“Health,” Twilight parroted, and they both drank.</p><p class="double">“Ah, that hits the spot,” Applejack said, rolling it around her mouth. “Bit of earthiness, bit of tang – Twilight? You okay, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Twilight finished a coughing fit. “Has it gone dark all of a sudden?”</p><p class="double">“Er... nope,” Applejack replied, confused.</p><p class="double">“Ah. Then it would appear I have gone blind.”</p><p class="double">The earth pony frowned at the bottle for a moment. “Ah well. Back to th&#039; drawing board.”</p><p class="double">“No, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some use for it. Just... not as a drink, except for ponies with a strong earth affinity.” Twilight stood, slowly and carefully. “I&#039;m going to go Ascend now, and fix my eyes. Er... which way&#039;s the barn?”</p><p class="double">Applejack pushed her shoulder gently. “Turn a bit... bit more... there.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Berry Punch blinked. “Okay, that&#039;s certainly an... interesting little number you&#039;ve got there, Applejack... I can really taste the solanine.”</p><p class="double">“The... ah, <i>hay</i>.” Applejack kicked the floor. “Now ah know what ah forgot. Y&#039;all gonna be fine?”</p><p class="double">The drinks-mare gulped, shook her head, and belched a cloud of green smoke which brought with it an earthy tang. “Yeah, I&#039;ll be fine. My tolerance is positively <i>metaphysical.</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora put down her retort, in which a testing potion was hissing alarmingly as the drops of potato cider fell into it.</p><p class="double">“My apologies, fair mare of earth. I fear I have no use for this poisonous beer.”</p><p class="double">“What, none? Not even in a potion?”</p><p class="double">“I said none, Applejack, and I meant it. If you think there is a way, invent it.”</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed. “Okay. Thanks anyway, Zecora.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Flame shot out of Spike&#039;s ears and nose.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Peewee was induced to try some, he promptly exploded. The adult phoenix which reformed from the cloud of smoke and feathers looked mildly peeved.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I see.” Discord downed the glass.</p><p class="double">Then caught fire.</p><p class="double">“I like it,” he pronounced, licking his claws and using them to extinguish his burning beard. The rest of him, he just left on fire.</p><p class="double">“What, really?” Applejack blinked. “I plumb didn&#039;t think anyone would. Well, you&#039;ll have t&#039; fight over it with Applebloom.”</p><p class="double">Discord looked intrigued. “What does she do with it?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applebloom grabbed a spanner, and used it to tighten a couple of bolts on the quad-cycle she was working on.</p><p class="double">“Ah, fiddlesticks...” she muttered, blipping the throttle to no response. “Somethin&#039;s blocking up the fuel line.”</p><p class="double">She picked up a small jar of potato cider, and dribbled a few drops into the engine tank before trying again. This time, it picked up beautifully.</p><p class="double">“Best all-natural engine lubricant ah&#039;ve seen in a while,” she pronounced. “Hmmm... wonder if ah might try that all-wood an&#039; plant products car project again...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.8 (Richardson)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, Rainbow Dash! There are plenty of things you can do in the hospital!&quot; Twilight cheerfully remarked as she rummaged through the hospital book cart. She knew it had to- Ah-HA! It was always wonderful to watch Dash fall in love with books whenever the mare wasn&#039;t Awake. It just felt right to add- err, enraptured another with the wonders of reading. &quot;Here, try reading this! It has everything, traps, adventure, ancient mysteries!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Jack Sparrow and the Sapphire Stone?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s mind crashed to a halt that some would say could be heard all the way in the world tree itself. &quot;What the bark?!&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Ya okay, sugarcube? Ya went really pale just then.&quot; Applejack asked as the farm mare came up beside her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, I just thought of something, that&#039;s all. Oh, by the way, Dash, there is something else. The events of the book actually happened. He actually exists, and the book is a way for him to make enough money to survive off of. Adventuring for a living doesn&#039;t pay well. He just publishes it under a pseudonym. &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? No way!&quot; Dash looked at her book in a new light and her eyes lit up as she looked over the grimy and tussled protagonist emblazoned on the cover. &quot;This guy is for real?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! He goes on way more adventures than us, but even I don&#039;t know how to find him. Maybe he&#039;ll come through the area looking for an ancient treasure, though. It&#039;s fun to read!&quot; Twilight looked to the door, wondering when she could get away to have a long talk with a certain looped</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hey! &#039;Guest starring Commander Cane, The HERO OF EQUESRIA&#039;. He&#039;s real, too? I thought he was just propaganda put out by the Guard!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight ran for the door as urgency struck her. Either one of the two was enough to cause a rough loop. Both of them, together!? &quot;Be back later, girls! I have to go water my tree, &#039;kaythanksbye!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s eatin&#039; her apple?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No idea. Hey! This actually is pretty good!&quot;</p><p class="double">Of course, if Twilight had any inkling of what she had been about to stumble into, she would have stayed home and hidden herself within a great fortress of books... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee and Zecora almost – <i>almost</i><i> – </i>shared a birthday.</p><p class="double">It was a weird cosmic coincidence, honestly. In fact, it was one of the few stable elements of the loop – which, as Twilight pointed out, was really strange. True, the dates of their birth would slide up and down the calendar like any other Looper&#039;s, but Zecora&#039;s birthday was always the day before Cheerilee&#039;s.</p><p class="double">The fact that they had started looping together only compounded their friendship. Well... almost started looping together.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, it... it turns out that Liz! The lizard! She was the anchor for the loop.&quot; Cheerilee snorted as she threw back another mug. &quot;Heh. She gave me, blue, blueprints for the bus, after I told her what Harry had told me about the loops back in Hogwarts. Liz the Lizard.&quot; She giggled.</p><p class="double">&quot;The phrasing is amusing, that is true.&quot; Zecora waved a hoof in a broad arc. &quot;Like Rainbow Dash... something something blue!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Something something blue?&quot; The earth pony nudged the zebra with a grin. &quot;You are totally drunk!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I may be intoxicated, but at least I&#039;m not <i>domesticated.</i>&quot; Zecora shot a sly grin at Cheerilee, waggling her eyebrows.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no no no. Not the Pony thing.&quot; The schoolteacher pointed. &quot;There are! Are worlds out there where ponies roam free and, and people ride zebras! I know it! I&#039;ve never been to one but, but...&quot; She sighed. &quot;Why did I start out with fused loops, Zeccy...? I don&#039;t understand.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fate works in mysterious ways,&quot; the alchemist intoned sombrely. &quot;Especially in repeating days. But the fact is that you&#039;re here now and let&#039;s not bother with the whys or hows. It&#039;s our midnight drinking bash! Take a tablecloth and make a sash!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m not quite drunk enough for that yet.... MAC! More booze, no love poison!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.10</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...alright,” Mayor Mare sighed. “You can give it a go. No use of pegasus magic or wings, Dash, neither of you are to Ascend – it&#039;s a pain handling the press – and you&#039;re not going on the leaderboard.”</p><p class="double">Dash and AJ exchanged glances. “Buck yeah!”</p><p class="double">“Just what ah was thinkin&#039;, <i>crash.</i>”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s SO on,” Dash pronounced. “You know how on it was before? It&#039;s more on now.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Go!”</p><p class="double">Dash launched herself forward, blowing leaves every which way as she shot out ahead of the rest of the herd.</p><p class="double">Sure, AJ was fit. Sure, everypony including Berry had beaten them the first time because they had been so focused on fowl play. But Dash&#039;s thing was <i>speed</i>. Even with her wings bound and no magic, Dash had far more experience as an athlete than Applejack did.</p><p class="double">“Coo-ee!”</p><p class="double">Dash blinked. “What?”</p><p class="double">With a rumbling roar, Applejack surfed past.</p><p class="double">She was running at a little more than half the speed that Dash was. And the ground she was running <i>on</i> was moving, independently, at a little more than half the speed Dash was.</p><p class="double">“Aw, come <i>on!</i>” Dash shouted. “That&#039;s <i>so</i> cheating!”</p><p class="double">“Rules don&#039;t say nothing about Earthbendin&#039;,” Applejack replied cheerfully. “Guess you&#039;re plumb out of luck, huh?”</p><p class="double">“Like hay!” Dash dug deep, focusing on her training, and accelerated.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, AJ?” Dash called. “I had a loop where I was something called a Rapidash.”</p><p class="double">“So?” Applejack replied, still working her artificial landsurf.</p><p class="double">“<i>Agility.</i>”</p><p class="double">A blue blur caught up to Applejack, and resolved into Dash. “Hey. I&#039;ve not done much foot racing recently, but... don&#039;t you think we should be going a bit faster?”</p><p class="double">With that, Dash accelerated away.</p><p class="double">“Tarnation.” Applejack scowled. “Right. No more missy nice pony.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twin blurs of motion shot past the finish line.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, how&#039;d we do?” Dash asked the photographer.</p><p class="double">“Vell...” Photo Finish shrugged. “It is, as zey say, appropriate that you asked me, little stormcloud.”</p><p class="double">She held up the photo. It showed both of them exactly in line as they passed the posts.</p><p class="double">“Ah...” Applejack searched for something to say. “Laurel.”</p><p class="double">“You have got to be kidding.” Dash gaped. “Dead heat?”</p><p class="double">“Ja.” Finish shrugged. “Now, I go.”</p><p class="double">She vanished in a blur.</p><p class="double">“Wait a sec,” Applejack said, looking after her. “...she your mother again?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.”</p><p class="double">“Ah see where y&#039;all get th&#039; speed, now...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.11 (Anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was not very happy with this loop.</p><p class="double">The grim city that had replaced Canterlot was overshadowed by a bright, white building that was much less pleasing to look at than Celestia&#039;s palace. From her position in an empty, overgrown lot that should have been the park beside the School For Gifted Unicorns, Twilight Sparkle could see three lines of text carved into the wall in large letters, though the angle wasn&#039;t right for her to read them.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t need to, because the slogan beneath the poster of a bearded crimson male alicorn pasted on the wall of a nondescript warehouse across the street from her was all she needed to identify what the basis for this fused Loop was. (Twilight desperately hoped that there were no Loopers native to that universe.)</p><p class="double">Fortunately, she was not completely alone this time. Only one Element was Awake, but she was exactly the pony Twilight needed, and she was standing right beside her. “Pinkamena Diane Pie,” she said seriously.</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight?” the other mare replied.</p><p class="double">“You know all those things I ask you not to do normally?” Twilight asked. “<i>Do </i>them.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie blinked. “You sure, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m completely serious.” Twilight smiled slightly. “Don&#039;t do anything that&#039;ll get me an angry eight-legged visitor next Loop, but other than that, do your worst. Go full Chaos Goddess. Liven this place up.”</p><p class="double">There was a bright pink light, and Pinkie ascended, her body swelling a moment later to a stature only slightly smaller than baseline Celestia. The Element around her neck was dim for a moment, then began to shine. She looked down at Twilight. “Are you coming?”</p><p class="double">Twilight summoned her own element and ascended, but she still shook her head. “No,” she said, “I think I&#039;ll just go... study the moons of the outer planets while you do your thing. I&#039;ll check back with you in about a year, okay?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded, rising into the air with two powerful beats of her wings. She brought her forehooves together, somehow making a popping noise like she was cracking non-existent knuckles and turning her attention back to the poster across the street.</p><p class="double">Twilight followed her gaze, reading the slogan one last time. <i>BIG STALLION IS WATCHING YOU</i>. “Have fun,” she told her friend, opening a small portal.</p><p class="double">“I <i><b>will</b></i>,” she promised, her horn glowing.</p><p class="double">Twilight was fairly certain that she closed the portal behind herself just in time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Twilight came back, she was surprised by what she saw. The once-overgrown lot was now again a well-maintained park, though one smaller than the baseline version. The city, from what she could see from her own position, was perhaps a bit brighter, but still recognizable from what she&#039;d briefly seen before setting Pinkie loose. The same white building stood over the city, and there was still a poster on the wall across the street.</p><p class="double">Though it was now a poster of a female, pink alicorn. “Friend Pinkie Is Watching You,” Twilight read, more than a little perplexed, and then she saw a smaller line of text underneath the slogan. She squinted her eyes, read, “But Only When It&#039;s Not Creepy,” and then smiled slightly.</p><p class="double">The park was empty, but a moment later two earth pony stallions galloped down the street, skidding to a halt when they saw Twilight. She realized that she hadn&#039;t reverted back to a unicorn and opened her mouth to try to explain, but one of the two interrupted Twilight before she could begin.</p><p class="double">“Hey, didn&#039;t you hear?” he asked. “Miniboredom is throwing a doubleplussuperawesome party and <i>everypony</i> is invited! You don&#039;t want to miss it!” Without waiting for an answer, the pair raced off.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared after them for a moment, then with a shrug took to the air and followed them. It probably <i>would</i> be a fun party. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Girls? Can we talk?&quot;</p><p class="double">The cutie mark crusaders looked up from their starfighter blueprints and smiled at their... well, former teacher.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure thing, miss Cheerilee!&quot; Scootaloo rolled up her own plans. &quot;Not like there&#039;s anything here I don&#039;t know already.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, Scoots, Ah&#039;m pretty sure Ah&#039;ll surprise ya once Ah&#039;m done.&quot; Apple Bloom slid her own sketches to the side.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle shrugged. &quot;Honestly, I&#039;m waiting for Tiara to get her, she understands this better. So... what&#039;s got you down?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee took a moment to mentally readjust herself. Even knowing that these fillies were technically older then the princesses... in their own way... it still took some effort to deal with them as equals. &quot;It&#039;s just... well... I&#039;m a teacher and...&quot; She sighed, sitting down. &quot;Well...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nopony else is learning?&quot; Scootaloo suggested. &quot;Nopony besides us, Diamond, and Nyx?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t forget Silver Spoon,&quot; Sweetie pointed out. &quot;She&#039;s looping now too.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare shook her head with a melancholy smile. &quot;Got it in one. And... I can&#039;t even teach you all properly, you&#039;ve already... learned so much.&quot; Cheerilee&#039;s eyes drifted skyward, watching the clouds meander by. &quot;The first few loops back at home I tried... I did what I usually do, and... well... now it&#039;s beginning to wear on me. I...&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom nodded. &quot;Ah&#039;m pretty sure Ah get where you&#039;re coming from. It&#039;s hard ta carry tech between loops, and that means lots of rebuilding based on what Ah know just ta get back ta inventing. You&#039;ve got it worse since your thing is tied up with nonloopers...&quot; She tapped her chin thoughtfully. &quot;...What if... what if ya spent a few loops teaching somewhere else? Like Fillydelphia or... tha Crystal Empire, actually, that could be good. And tutoring Silver during tha loops should be a mutually beneficial thing...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s also the &#039;multiple interpretation&#039; thing cutie marks have,&quot; Sweetie pointed out. &quot;You could take up gardening! Or... terraforming!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And we&#039;d always be ready to learn something from fused loops we haven&#039;t been to!&quot; Scootaloo added. &quot;Just think, you could have your own private lecture hall!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee giggled at the pegasus&#039;s enthusiasm. &quot;...Thanks. I... I guess I should try those things out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re welcome.&quot; Apple Bloom grinned. &quot;Oh, and by the way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS GROUP GLOMP YAY!&quot;</b> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.13 (LordofBones)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike gulped at the expressionless look on Twilight&#039;s face as he confessed his desire to meet his own kind, even after the disaster that had been the Garble incident. The unicorn seized him in her telekinetic grip and marched out towards the Everfree, and for a moment the little dragon felt that old terror that he was going to be abandoned by his best friend. Twilight didn&#039;t bother looking at him, but simply marched onwards, deeper and deeper into the Everfree, until they stood at the mouth of a cave. </p><p class="double">Then Twilight walked in. </p><p class="double">The cave opened up into a large complex built into an open-topped mountain, and it was filled with <i>dragons. </i>Huge wyrms with purple, blue, black, red scales held court with fascinated younger drakes; a giggling young dragoness was leading an interested cyan male on a merry flight; several couples waited at the alcoves, tails entwined lovingly, as they watched their children play; a sinuous green was muttering to itself and comparing long sheaves of parchment with a grizzled white and a dignified blue. Hot springs dotted the huge cavern, with half-asleep dragons simply relaxing in the waters.</p><p class="double">And everything came to a screeching stop when Twilight walked in, most faithful assistant in tow. </p><p class="double">The lavender unicorn noticed Garble and his lackeys immediately. True to form, the sneering trio immediately lunged, claws and fire at the ready, and were smacked away like rag dolls by a huge azure-scaled tail. A behemoth with gigantic wings rose from the darkest shadows of the mountain and strode forward, its footsteps created small earthquakes with each passing. Fearlessly, Twilight met the cold, crimson gaze and said something in a low, deep language that Spike had never heard before. </p><p class="double">The monster halted in its tracks and stared. Those penetrating red eyes grew large in disbelief, and a voice that sounded like mountains grinding boomed across the complex. <i>&quot;Where did you learn the language of the First and Last, horse?&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I read a lot,&quot; Twilight shot back snarkily. </p><p class="double">Gasps rose from their draconic audience. Spike shut his eyes and prayed that Twilight hadn&#039;t just snarked at a dragon thrice the size of the library.</p><p class="double">The wyrm threw back his horned head and <i>roared </i>with laughter. The laugh was surprisingly warm and pleasant, even if it rattled the floating drake&#039;s bones, and when it finally stopped, the visibly amused winged serpent nodded. <i>&quot;Very well, proceed.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Twilight bowed respectfully and gently set Spike down. &quot;Hello everydragon, my name is Twilight Sparkle, student of Celestia Sunbringer and Bearer of the Element of Magic. This is Spike, my faithful assistant, helper and little brother!&quot; </p><p class="double">The little dragon&#039;s eyes went huge at the announcement, and through his joy at Twilight&#039;s words he noticed that every eye was fixed on him. </p><p class="double">&quot;Through the years I&#039;ve known him, Spike has stood alongside me against the Eternal Ever-Changing Serpent himself, as well as the power that drove Luna Dreamwalker to madness, and he did so because <i>his friends were in danger!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Murmurs rose from the crowd as they looked at each other and back at the blushing drake. </p><p class="double">&quot;In addition to that, Spike is an excellent chef, gemhunter, jeweller, musician, actor, emcee and accountant! He has ties with the Equestrian Crown and the elite of Equestria! Dragonesses and drakes, <i>he even cleans up after himself!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">An appreciative &quot;oooh&quot; went up from the audience. Twilight heard one dragoness comment to her friend, &quot;That&#039;s just what we need, you know? None of these macho fire-breathers; we want someone who can run a household and manage the hoard responsibly.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;But, alas, Spike is an orphan. Nopony, not even Celestia herself, knows who his parents are. He knows nothing about his people, his culture, his history. In fact, thanks to three young drakes, he believes that his people <i>murder babies! He is terrified of being a monster, because three of you sullied all of dragonkind before an impressionable, lonely CHILD!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Was it worth it?!&quot; </i>Twilight spat, stalking closer towards a dazed Garble as the dragons roared and screeched in outrage. <i>&quot;Was it worth crushing the dreams of an orphan, just so you could get your jollies off? Was it worth forcing Spike to think that dragonkind murder unborn children in front of their parents for ENTERTAINMENT?! </i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;WHAT?!&quot; </i>boomed the azure titan. A triad of nervous dragons snatched the trio and backed off at the furious look on the patriarch&#039;s face. <i>&quot;I&#039;ll deal with you three after this!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I implore you, dragons of the Everfree. I implore you, please, teach my little brother, because I cannot,&quot; Twilight ended with a whisper. She kissed Spike&#039;s crest and backed away. </p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot; Spike&#039;s voice was tiny. </p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll be back in a week, Spike. I promise. Have fun,&quot; she smiled at him as she trotted away, making sure to keep the young dragon in her sights until she heard wingbeats. A young dragoness with a startling resemblance to Rarity scooped the surprised drake up and cuddled him, followed by several others. </p><p class="double">&quot;Look at these adorable cuddly cheeks!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t hog him!&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Sing for us, cutie!&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Look, he&#039;s blushing! Isn&#039;t that just sweet?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.14 (SpaceKGreen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee smiled as she looked over her class. Her students were diligently working on their schoolwork, and she had a bit of time to herself.</p><p class="double">The Loop had been quiet so far; Nyx was Awake, so the Nightmare Moon situation hadn&#039;t occurred, and Twilight had headed off most of the other usual Ponyville crises. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon (surprisingly an Earth Pony this loop) were also Awake, so she hadn&#039;t had to deal with their bullying either.</p><p class="double">There was a sudden commotion outside, and Cheerilee frowned, as the children craned their necks trying to look out the windows. This was new; normally this was a quiet week...</p><p class="double">The schoolhouse door burst open, and a large pony made of black crystal, shedding drops of dark magic, strode in. Fanged jaws parted open, and a terrifying voice boomed forth.</p><p class="double">&quot;HEAR NOW AND OBEY. THE DARK KING SOMBRA IS NOW YOUR LORD AND MASTER. ALL SLAVES ARE TO-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me!&quot;</p><p class="double">The crystal golem paused. It took in the classroom; the children were riveted to their seats, wide eyes staring at both the golem and the teacher, who was currently glaring at the intruder.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know WHAT you were thinking, but class is currently in session! If you wish to talk, you can wait outside for class to end.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;QUIET SLAVE. YOU SHALL GATHER THESE BRATS AND-&quot;</p><p class="double">The golem was interrupted as the teacher seemed to flicker, and a piece of chalk bounced off its head hard enough to rattle its crystalline brain.</p><p class="double">&quot;I SAID, class is in SESSION right now!&quot; growled Cheerilee. &quot;Wait OUTSIDE, and I will get to you AFTER CLASS.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOU STUPID SLAVE. RESISTANCE WILL BE MET WITH DEATH.&quot; the golem boomed, as it strode towards Cheerilee menacingly, the dark magic dripping from its body having increased to a torrent. &quot;YOU AND ALL THESE BRATS SHALL-&quot;</p><p class="double">Again it was interrupted, this time as an eraser hit it hard enough to carry it out through the door and across the road.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee sighed, feeling the stares of the students on her. &quot;Well, class, it seems school is out early today due to a national crisis. Please line up in an orderly fashion and move to the emergency bunker. It should hold up against the golem until the Royal Guard shows up.&quot;</p><p class="double">At that moment, a large rainbow wave of magic exploded from somewhere inside Ponyville. The golem, attempting to right itself, collapsed into an inanimate pile of crystal as the blast wave passed over.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee watched it for a few moments. After determining that it wasn&#039;t about to get back up, she turned to the staring students with a bright smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well! It seems the national crisis has passed. However, following standard procedure, you children should wait here for your relatives to pick you up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seeing the students continue to stare, she smiled again. &quot;Tell you what. Since you&#039;ve been such good students, I&#039;ll let you have the next... 3 days off.&quot;</p><p class="double">This broke the silence, as the students cheered. As far as they were concerned, Cheerilee was now officially the Best. Teacher. Ever. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">50.15</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“It is time for you... to fulfil... your destiny,” Celestia said grandly.</p><p class="double">Twilight, in what probably shouldn&#039;t have surprised anypony, pulled out a list. “Which one?”</p><p class="double">“...pardon?” Celestia frowned. “Which one?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;ve got quite a few of them by now. Let&#039;s see... be the most powerful unicorn in my generation, that&#039;s done. Gain the Element of Magic, done. Beat Discord? Done-a-roonie.”</p><p class="double">She began making tally marks in the floor, under the gaze of an increasingly bemused Celestia and all the other Elements. “I&#039;m fairly sure the thing with Chrysalis was something involving destiny as well. Rematch with Trixie? Yeah, sounds about right. Oh, the time travel thing – and all those Pinkie Sense incidents. If those had gone wrong, I might have broken time, so that all sounds destiny-y.”</p><p class="double">Twilight unrolled the scroll further. “Sombra, yeah, that sounds good... aha!”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked hopeful. “Yes?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn rolled up the scroll. “I&#039;ve got it! I&#039;m ready to become the best high jumping unicorn in history!”</p><p class="double">Even Pinkie looked confused at that.</p><p class="double">Seeing their expressions, Twilight shrugged. “Well, what else am I going to do with these wings?”</p><p class="double">She dropped the perception filter she&#039;d put on them back when she&#039;d <i>really</i> ascended, dealing with Sombra, and everypony jumped.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;d those come from?” Dash demanded.</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “Around.”</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
