<p>101.1 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double">The night prior to the Summer Sun Celebration had fallen, and Spike had managed to get Chiyo and Osaka away from the others. Spike closed the door on the party going on outside.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Summer Sun Celebration pre-party is usually livelier.&quot; Spike said to no one in particular as he turned to the duo. &quot;I wanted to get you away for few minutes to go over your progress. You&#039;ve been doing very well, but Nightmare Moon might be a bit scary. Not sure why I haven&#039;t mentioned it before, but Equestria is a sanctuary loop, so if you want me to take care of her, I can do that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo looked visibly relieved. &quot;Oh that..&quot;</p><p class="double">She was interrupted the sound of muffled speaking from the door. Osaka quietly opened it to reveal the forms of Sakaki, Kagura, Yomi and Tomi who had been listening behind the door.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So how much did you hear?&quot; said Spike after the remain four entered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not much! Something about Nightmare...Moon...&quot; said Kagura uncertainly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Chiyo has to fight her.&quot; Osaka idly commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! This must be like in one of those &#039;Filly From A Technological Kingdom&#039; stories.&quot; Getting blank stares from everypony, Tomo continued. &quot;You know? Princess from long-lost Technological Kingdom comes to Equestria to escape the villain that killed her family. But the villain chased after her, and now she&#039;s got to fight her. Or something like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">A smug look rested on as her face she nodded to herself.</p><p class="double">A bead of sweat appeared on Chiyo&#039;s face. &quot;Right, something like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, Short Stuff, you know we won&#039;t let you down!&quot; said Kagura. There were similar expressions made by the other ponies.</p><p class="double">&quot;You guys!&quot; Chiyo&#039;s eyes streamed with tears of joy.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what do we need to do?&quot; Asked Yomi.</p><p class="double">Spike who&#039;d had a knowing smile on his face during the exchange spoke up. &quot;Well. We&#039;ll need the Elements of Harmony. I can get those from their resting place pretty quickly. Nightmare Moon will appear during the Summer Sun Celebration. All you&#039;ll need to do is stand with Short Stuff as she introduces you as each of the Elements in turn. There are six of them Honesty, Generosity...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;The night will last forever!&quot; Lightning flashed, and thunder roared as Nightmare Moon spoke to the assembled ponies at the Summer Sun Celebration.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, your...highness. Why would you want to do that?&quot; Asked Yomi as she and other sat at a large covered table.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; asked Nightmare Moon incredulously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you know. Wouldn&#039;t everything freeze to death eventually?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon seemed to consider that as she lazily waved her hoof around. &quot;All right, a few hours of sunlight per day, but I&#039;m being generous here.&quot;</p><p class="double">A few of the ponies sighed in relief, but Chiyo and her friends bravely stood forward.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, but we can&#039;t let you do that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And how are you going to stop me?&quot; Cackled Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">&quot;With these!&quot; The cover from the table was removed to reveal the stone forms of the Elements of Harmony.</p><p class="double">&quot;Crap!&quot; Said a panicking Nightmare Moon. &quot;I won&#039;t go back! You won&#039;t send me back!&quot; A faint fog emerged from her mane swiftly covering the area.</p><p class="double">There were gasps of shock that quickly became yawns as the assembled ponies quickly fell to the ground asleep.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah! My Sleep Fog will do the trick. I..forgot..this..works..on..me..too. Whoever..heard..of..such..a..ridiculous..technique?&quot; Nightmare Moon struggled to stay awake, but soon succumbed to her it as well.</p><p class="double">It was at that moment that Spike walked in on the assembled ponies. In his claws were a bowl of salsa and a bag of chips. &quot;All right, I brought the...chips?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had seemed like Tomo had been walking forever, but she finally reached her destination. The base of a large snow capped mountain and her goal. She took out a few bits from somewhere and inserted them into a slot in the mountain. She pressed a button and with a rumbling, a cubbyhole opened in the mountain. There was a click followed by a thunk, and liquid began squirting from the ceiling of the cubbyhole to Tomo&#039;s growing horror.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait! Wait! Stop!&quot; Tomo stuck her head in the cubbyhole and stuck out her tongue. As a few of the last drops reached her tongue, and she fell back in bliss at the heavenly nectar she tasted.</p><p class="double">Her moment of ecstasy was cut short as a polite cough reached her ears. Yomi and Kagura, dressed as cops stood behind her disapprovingly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Drinking coffee without donuts? That&#039;s a misdemeanor! It&#039;s off to jail for you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But I&#039;m a cop too!&quot; Tomo whined.</p><p class="double">&quot;That just makes it worse! That&#039;s a felony! Off with her head!&quot;</p><p class="double">All that was heard as they dragged her away was Tomo&#039;s cry of &quot;Nooooooooo!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tomo landed in the oubliette with a thud. As she looked around, she saw that the only furniture present was a small prison cot which she promptly sat on.</p><p class="double">She contemplated her failure. &quot;All my life I just wanted ponies to take me seriously, but in the end I was just a clown.&quot; There was a flash of light from beneath her cot. She looked down to find a glowing thimble big enough to be a hat. She promptly put it on her head, and a smile grew on her face as her surroundings faded around her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Osaka stood before the clay tennis court garden before her. It was planted entirely with a crop of eggplants. Each was labeled with the name of one her friends, but the largest was a dark, shiny one labeled with the name &#039;Nightmare Moon.&#039; She wondered, with all the effort it would take, how she was ever going to harvest them all.</p><p class="double">She sighed, and as she did so a small brown puppy walked up beside her. It spoke with Kyon&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know you don&#039;t have to do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Osaka sighed again. &quot;I have to harvest all these eggplants. It&#039;s for my friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">Osaka started on the first one, pulling at it with her teeth and telekinetic grip. Puppy Kyon shrugged, muttered something about how she was a &#039;troublesome girl&#039; and moved to grab it with his teeth as well.</p><p class="double">Soon, the whole field was cleared except for the Nightmare Moon Eggplant. A wave of ennui flashed over her, but she steeled her reserves and went after the last one. It took some effort, but the Eggplant started to move, and as it did so, it started to glow. The more Osaka pulled, the brighter it got, until finally she grabbed and with one final tug, it pulled free, the light growing brighter and brighter as her surroundings began to fade.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Yomi stood before the assembled crowd of flowers that had gathered at the base of the stage she was on. She looked at the ice cream cone mic mounted in front of her and started to sing, but her voice was off-key, and she had no rhythm. Why she expected to sing well, she wasn&#039;t sure, but the crowd ate it up.</p><p class="double">They cried. &quot;Bravo! Bravo! Encore! Encore!&quot; Even as the flowers cried that, she noticed that they had started to wilt.</p><p class="double">She blushed and turned around, wondering what to do. What had been behind her was a full length mirror, and in that mirror, instead of her reflection was Tomo&#039;s.</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on Curry! Sing some more! So what if a few flowers die? They obviously love it!&quot;</p><p class="double">She felt a flash of anger followed by shame shoot through her. She turned around to face the audience.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry everypony. My singing is horrible. I can&#039;t let you die because of my ego.&quot; She went up to the ice cream microphone and started licking it. As the ice cream started to be consumed and what was left became gradually brighter and brighter even as her surrounding began to fade away.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Kagura was back in school, and she&#039;d forgotten her homework! Fortunately, she was in a fish school, and no fish cared. Kagura sighed in relief. They were on their way to visit the Great Butter Reef. As she swam along with the school, signs kept popping up. On her left, one said &quot;Homework. This way!&quot; On her right, another said, &quot;Homework? We&#039;ve got you covered.&quot; Each pointed away from the direction that the school was traveling on, and as she continued her journey, they only became more frequent and more insistent.</p><p class="double">She turned and nudged one of her fellow fish, nodding and pointing a fin at the sign. &quot;Hey! Is homework really important?&quot;</p><p class="double">It turned to her. &quot;Glub.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nodding, she continued with her journey. The school finally reached their destination, and Kagura caught sight of a glow coming from underneath a reef. Over there was an oyster, it halves wide open. In the center, was a chocolate malt ball. She reached out and grabbed it and as she did so it became brighter and brighter, and the world faded before her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sakaki was as free as a bird, because she was a bird. A plover bird to be precise. She flew across the savannah until she saw the object of her search. A great herd of cats was stampeding across the plains.</p><p class="double">&quot;What majestic beasts.&quot; She thought to herself.</p><p class="double">She flitted from cat to cat, picking the gummy worms and honey ants out of the creature&#039;s coats. One, however, looked to be in pain; an old grey cat. It lifted its majestic mouth, and Sakaki bounced from tooth to tooth, pecking until his teeth were clean. But then she noticed something. In the back of the mouth was a chisel stuck between two of its teeth. She could get it, but it required sticking her head into the creature&#039;s mouth farther than she was comfortable.</p><p class="double">Great roars of pain came from the beast, and she decided to chance it. She stuck her head and grabbed hold of the chisel, but her fears came to pass, and the mouth promptly closed. The chisel started to glow, but as she pulled on it, the mouth closed even further. She figured that if she let go of the chisel, she could probably back herself out. But the beast was in pain, and she wasn&#039;t the type to abandon an animal like that. She yanked with all her might, and the chisel came free just as her world faded around her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chiyo was on a large platform. It stood at the end of a large bridge situated in a very large vertical shaft. In front of her was a floating orange cat person of some sort, and more unusually, it wore a large, sinister, black helmet and cloak. Lastly, she seemed to have had her right front hoof cut off at some point. However it didn&#039;t hurt, and the creature in front of her had her full attention as it spoke in a deep, gravelly voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Join me, Chiyo. Spike never told you what happened to your father.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Chiyo! I...AM...YOUR...FATHER!&quot; It waved an appendage as if to mimic shaking a fist.</p><p class="double">&quot;Umm...that&#039;s not possible. I already have a father.&quot; As if to punctuate this, one of the panels on the vertical shaft slid open, and a dark blue unicorn appeared. &quot;Hey Pumpkin!&quot; He called and waved.</p><p class="double">Chiyo waved back. &quot;Hey Daddy!&quot; The panel slid closed again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;ll deal with him later.&quot; The Cat-like Dark Lord muttered to itself. &quot;Nevertheless, I am your father, and you will join me! You don&#039;t yet realize your importance to Nightmare Moon. Together we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to Equestria!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll never join you!&quot; Chiyo cried.</p><p class="double">The panel slid open, and the blue unicorn appeared again. &quot;Hang in there Chiyo!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks Daddy!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re alone! Your friends will not help you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes they will! I&#039;ll prove it you!&quot; With that, she leaped off the platform and down the shaft. She was sucked into an air intake and after sliding here and there, finally fell out, landing on the bottom of an open umbrella sticking out from the underside of a giant dinosaur as it walked along. It was truly an enormous dinosaur, as all she could see were its legs and clouds as it walked along.</p><p class="double">Chiyo began to feel afraid, but all she could do was trust in her friends.</p><p class="double">Another panel slid open, and the blue unicorn popped up again, saying.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hang in there, Chiyo!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m trying daddy!&quot;</p><p class="double">The panel closed again.</p><p class="double">Minutes passed, and she heard the whine of a rocket engine and a spaceship came into view, turning and then hovering underneath her. On top of the ship, a portal opened and a very shaggy Yomi appeared.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve got you Chiyo.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chiyo leaped down, and along with Yomi entered the ship. As she entered the hatch, she noticed a wooden leg dangling from the side of the entry way to the ship. She grabbed it with her telekinesis and attached it to her leg. As she did do, the leg started growing brighter and brighter, even as the world started fading around her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chiyo was standing on the bridge of a spaceship. Well, it was a literal bridge, and she was standing on it, in space. Her friends were there with her.</p><p class="double">A very shaggy looking Yomi tried to speak. &quot;Raarrrgharagh!&quot;</p><p class="double">Tomo ribbed her. &quot;Yomi, you&#039;ve got marbles in your mouth.&quot;</p><p class="double">Realization washed over Yomi, and she started spitting them out into the koi pond that was in front and below her.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s better.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s that space station ahead of us?&quot; Asked Osaka.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s no space station! That&#039;s Nightmare Moon!&quot;</p><p class="double">The bridge pulled up next to a basketball sized metallic ball. A Mini Death Star. As they did so, their viewscreen lit up, and Nightmare Moon and Cat Vader hovering behind her appeared before them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wanna race?&quot; Nightmare Moon asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ll beat you!&quot; Chiyo cried.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hah! In your dreams!&quot;</p><p class="double">A starting line appeared in space before them, and the announcer began a countdown.</p><p class="double">&quot;3..2..1..Go!&quot;</p><p class="double">The mini-death star took off in reverse, spiraling out of control. It finally stopped, and Nightmare Moon appeared on screen again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Had the silly thing in reverse.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Mini-Death Star started moving again, but this time extremely slowly.</p><p class="double">Cat Vader whispered something to her.</p><p class="double">&quot;What! I&#039;ve got to switch it from automatic to manual?&quot; Nightmare Moon pushed a button and the Mini Death Star shot forward, gaining incredible speed.</p><p class="double">&quot;After her! We can&#039;t let her win!&quot; The space bridge shot forward as well, chasing after Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">The chase took them past planets, past stars, past galaxies, but they couldn&#039;t catch her. Then Chiyo noticed that Sakaki was waving her legs frantically, trying to get her attention. She pointed down at the button on the bridge marked &quot;Instant Win&quot; that Chiyo then pushed. A rainbow beam of light shot out of the bridge, hitting the Mini Death Star, and the world faded to nothingness.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the effects of the sleep technique wore off, the first thing Chiyo noticed was that she&#039;d been laying on her rihttght hoof, cutting off all the blood supply to it. She shook it to relieve some of the numbness.</p><p class="double">Around her, her friends were awakening from the sleep technique used by Nightmare Moon. Nightmare Moon herself, however, was nowhere to be found. In her place, was, as Spike had told her, the awakening form of Princess Luna.</p><p class="double">It was at this point that Princess Celestia chose to make her appearance. As everypony bowed, Spike nudged Chiyo in the side and grinned. &quot;Knew you could do it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess Luna, my dear sister, it has been so long and it is so good to see you. We were meant to rule Equestria together. Will you accept my friendship and join me at my side?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Tia!&quot; Princess Luna ran up to Celestia, doing the pony version of an embrace. In a soft voice, Celestia whispered six sweet little words into Luna&#039;s ears.</p><p class="double">&quot;You still owe me twenty bits.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, this sucks!&quot; Cried Tomo. &quot;You mean I won&#039;t remember any of this?&quot; Spike had made a full explanation of the loops and their nature to the assembled ponies before him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;ll remember.&quot; said Osaka.</p><p class="double">&quot;Me too.&quot; mentioned Chiyo.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;d better tell me about this when I finally start looping.&quot; Said a stern Tomo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hey. Can you tell us about who we replaced?&quot; Said Kagura suddenly.</p><p class="double">Spike removed a large photo album.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can do even better.&quot;</p><p class="double">As he flipped through the pages, there were &#039;Ohs&#039; and &#039;Ahs&#039; as Spike explained who the various ponies were until Tomo tapped a hoof at one in particular, a white unicorn with purple hair.</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s really pretty. Who is she?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity. My wife.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the assembled ponies promptly face faulted, Spike rolled his eyes. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">101.2 (Hubris Plus) (Continued From 85.13)</p><p class="double">&quot;So you&#039;re telling me,&quot; Rainbow Dash began as she and Fluttershy left Canterlot High, blithely ignoring the end of the day announcements over the intercom as usual. &quot;That queen bitch of bitch mountain <i>hugged</i> you-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I would never call her that...&quot; The girl interjected.</p><p class="double">&quot;-then made a big key out of <i>nothing</i>-&quot; Dash continued, barely noticing the interruption.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, yes, that-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;-and then ran out here and jumped into the school statue.&quot; She finished, gesticulating wildly to convey how ridiculous the whole thing sounded.</p><p class="double">&quot;That, um, about sums it up,&quot; Fluttershy answered quietly. &quot;Unless I was seeing things, which could happen, you know how I can be. Maybe we should ask someone else? There were a lot of people there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Nah, Shy, I believe ya. It&#039;s just, you know,&quot; she waved her arms for emphasis again. &quot;Crazy.&quot; The pair soon came upon the statue, two girls already clustered around it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look,&quot; Rarity said, prodding at the surface Sunset Shimmer had vanished through. &quot;When you put your hand through, it turns into a... A thingy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a hoof, darlin&#039;,&quot; Applejack informed her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it?&quot; She answered thoughtfully. &quot;I had no idea hooves could look so... <i>Fabulous</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;ll take yer word fer it,&quot; the farmer agreed.</p><p class="double">&quot;They laughed at me,&quot; came Lyra&#039;s bombastic proclamation from the school&#039;s entrance, the girl loaded down with so much recording gear that she needed Pinkie&#039;s guidance to stop her from running into people. &quot;I told them, right when she first showed up, &#039;this girl doesn&#039;t know how to work doors or computers and has the worst handwriting any of us has seen since preschool. She&#039;s obviously an alien.&#039; They laughed, called my theory a joke! <i>Well who&#039;s laughing now?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; Pinkie answered, hopping up and down and waving a hand over her head. &quot;Pick me, pick me! I know this one!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Yes, Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s me, I&#039;m laughing!&quot; She punctuated the statement with a bout of maniacal laughter that would have done a Heterodyne proud.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Pinkie,&quot; Lyra sighed in exasperation. &quot;I&#039;m laughing, because <i>Sunset Shimmer was totally an alien the whole time!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I dunno, Lyra, what if she was a slider? Or a time traveler? Or a psychic?&quot; She suddenly stopped to perform one of her patented enormous gasps. &quot;What if she was the snarky ordinary one?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And people call <i>me</i> crazy,&quot; Lyra muttered, forging ahead despite Pinkie having stopped and her own vision being blocked by the stack of equipment. It didn&#039;t take long for her to bump into an oblivious Rainbow Dash, who, along with Fluttershy, had gathered around the statue. Unbalanced as she was, that was all it took to make her topple forwards, her equipment tumbling to the ground and the four girls in front of her tumbling through the portal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! Nonono,&quot; she panicked, staring at her scattered gear. &quot;Not the camera, the AV club is gonna <i>kill</i> me! Pinkie, you gotta-&quot; She looked up just in time to see a shock of pink hair pass through the base of the statue. &quot;Pinkie?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Is it just me,&quot; Rainbow Dash groaned, &quot;or did everything just taste like teal dubstep for a second?&quot; After a few of the most confusing seconds of her life, she&#039;d ended up lying on her back on something warm and lumpy, staring up at a stone ceiling. There was also a weird pinching sensation in her... Shoulders? She wanted to say shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounded more like an ultraviolet tootsie roll to me, Dashy!&quot; Pinkie proclaimed, her mess of pink hair bobbing in the periphery of Dash&#039;s vision as the premier party person bounced around the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s nice, Pi-&quot; She was interrupted by a distinctly accented muffled shout from beneath her. &quot;Uh, what was that, AJ?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah <i>said</i>,&quot; the farmer announced, heaving herself upwards and shaking the athlete from her back. &quot;Get offa me, ya big galoot!&quot; This was swiftly followed by a series of squeaked apologies as Fluttershy realized she was in the same position and hurriedly climbed off of Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, guys,&quot; Dash commented from her new position sprawled on the ground. &quot;Why are you all horses?&quot;</p><p class="double">The group froze, except for Pinkie who it was widely agreed would explode if she stopped moving for over five seconds, before exploding in a flurry of sound and movement as they examined themselves and one another.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh goodness, oh goodness, oh goodness...&quot; Fluttershy repeated, eyes wide and wings subconsciously folding around her protectively.</p><p class="double">&quot;My <i>fingers!</i>&quot; Rarity shrieked, holding a trembling hoof to one eye. &quot;Where in heavens are my <i>fingers?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Omigosh, you guys, I have a <i>tail!</i>&quot; Pinkie squealed enthusiastically, taking the opportunity to chase her new appendage in a tight circle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aaahhhh!&quot; Rainbow called out, scrambling to her hooves, &quot;I can&#039;t play soccer like this! I don&#039;t even know if these count as arms!&quot; She flailed her forehooves in the air and promptly fell flat on her face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now everyone <i>calm down!</i>&quot; Applejack shouted, rearing up and slamming her her forehooves into the stone floor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Calm down,&quot; Rarity scowled. &quot;<i>Calm down?!</i> Applejack, we have been turned into <i>horses!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ponies,&quot; the farmer corrected.</p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot; Rainbow deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Proportions ain&#039;t right fer a horse,&quot; she explained. &quot;We&#039;re ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t care if we&#039;re <i>one eyed one horned flying purple people eaters!</i>&quot; The fashionista shouted, &quot;it sure looks strange to me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Applejack began. &quot;I reckon yer right. But I also reckon that panickin&#039; ain&#039;t gonna do any good either. We gotta take stock if we&#039;re gonna get outta this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shous li a plah hu mi,&quot; Pinkie mumbled before a flummoxed Rainbow tugged the curly tail out of her mouth. &quot;Sounds like a plan to me!&quot; She repeated cheerfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright,&quot; Rarity agreed after taking a few deep calming breaths. &quot;That&#039;s reasonable. So. Where do we stand?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right here, silly,&quot; the partier answered, waving a hoof at the room. It was a small chamber of undecorated stone that hadn&#039;t been used in some time if the thin layer of dust was anything to judge by. Aside from the large disturbance they had made upon arrival, the only marks were a set of tracks leading to the heavy wooden door that had been left ajar, its heavy padlock left dangling. Opposite the door was seemingly the only decoration in the room, an ornate standing mirror that cast the chamber in ethereal light.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;m just gonna take a flyin&#039; leap,&quot; Applejack started, gesturing at the mirror. &quot;An&#039; say we probably came through that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Dash followed up before trotting to the door. &quot;And I think it&#039;s safe to say that Crazy McNutjob went this way.&quot; She nosed the door open and looked out into a hallway lined with dozens of similar doors.</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; where do ya think yer goin&#039;?&quot; The farmer asked as the athlete took a step out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah come on, we&#039;ve already been sent back in time to before horses evolved into people and lived in castles,&quot; Dash reasoned. &quot;Might as well keep going.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...First of all, you really <i>must</i> pay more attention in biology. And history,&quot; Rarity pointed out as the athlete grumbled about not needing any of that egghead stuff. &quot;But I suppose you have a point. In for a penny, in for a pound, as they say. In any case, I <i>certainly</i> don&#039;t intend to go through <i>that</i> again any time soon,&quot; she added, pointing to the mirror.</p><p class="double">&quot;Woo! Pony castle adventure!&quot; Pinkie cheered.</p><p class="double">&quot;I, um, think we should just stay here,&quot; Fluttershy said quietly. &quot;If you want to, I mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, that&#039;s fine,&quot; Dash waved off. &quot;You can stick around and guard the portal, or something.&quot; She stepped out into the corridor, followed by a bouncing Pinkie and a Rarity who had sorted out walking elegantly on four legs surprisingly quickly. Applejack glanced between the door and the pegasus for a moment before offering Fluttershy an apologetic smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, sugar cube, but those three are a heap more likely to run inta trouble out there than you are in here,&quot; she offered. &quot;Sit tight and we&#039;ll be back in two shakes.&quot; The suddenly-a-yellow-pony fidgeted as the farmer left the room, biting her lip uncertainly, before bolting for the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait for <i>mee~ee!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As it turned out, Fluttershy didn&#039;t have to go very far at all to find her friends. They were clustered just a few doors down, gathered round Rainbow Dash as she shakily raised herself from the floor.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Think we should take this slow, sugar cube,&quot; Applejack was saying.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uhg,&quot; Dash grumbled. &quot;You girls <i>know</i> how I feel about the S-word.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Be that as it may,&quot; Rarity admonished. &quot;<i>None</i> of us quite know how this works, so I&#039;ll thank you to think of the rest of us before you go gallivanting off again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>She</i> seems to be doing fine,&quot; the athlete noted, pointing out Pinkie as she continued bouncing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, <i>this</i> is easy,&quot; the unstoppable hyperactive dynamo explained. &quot;It&#039;s just up-and-down and up-and-down and up-and-down and up-and-down and-&quot; She took a moment to inhale a huge lungful of air,&quot; up-and-down! <i>Walking</i> is all kinds of hard. I mean, it&#039;s all front-left, rear-right, front-right, front-left, wait-I-think-missed-one.&quot; She crumpled into a giggling heap as she put action to her words.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Okay, point taken, we&#039;ll go... Not-so-fast,&quot; Dash relented, slumping slightly for a moment before continuing on at a more sedate pace. Whatever had transformed them had seen fit to grace them with enough muscle memory to get by so long as they didn&#039;t attempt anything <i>too</i> strenuous.</p><p class="double">Which was why the group paused again not long after, having come upon the greatest challenge of their brief time as ponies.</p><p class="double">Stairs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you think that, maybe, this is a good place to turn back?&quot; Fluttershy queried, eying the steps uncertainly. Her attempts to focus on walking had been counterproductive and led to the most stumbling out of the rest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Guys,&quot; Rainbow rolled her eyes as she climbed the first few steps. &quot;They&#039;re <i>stairs</i>, we&#039;ll be-&quot; Her rear hooves, having reached the stairs, caught on the edge and tripped her. The others winced in unison at the <i>crack!</i> of her jaw colliding with the stone, followed by a series of smaller impacts as she backslid. &quot;Gettin&#039; <i>real</i> tired of this shit,&quot; she groaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, goodness!&quot; Fluttershy fretted, wings quivering. &quot;Rainbow, are you alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; the athlete brushed off as she got back to her hooves. She attempted to rub at her aching jaw with a forehoof, but the action nearly spilled her back onto the ground. &quot;Uhg, come on!&quot; She shouted, wings springing out in irritation. &quot;Why is this so hard?! All I wanna do is,&quot; she gesticulated wildly at the cursed obstacle, &quot;climb some stupid stairs!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, Dash...&quot; Applejack queried, looking up at her.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>What?!</i>&quot; The perturbed pegasus barked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re, ah, flying darling,&quot; Rarity inserted.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m doing what now?&quot; Dash whipped her head around to stare at her flapping wings, which chose that moment to fold back to her sides. &quot;Sooooo much hate,&quot; she groaned from her familiar position on the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dashy!&quot; Pinkie gasped, hopping over and hanging her face directly over her fallen friend&#039;s head. &quot;That was the coolest most awesomest thing I&#039;ve ever seen! Wait, omigosh,&quot; her eyes widened and she bounded over to Fluttershy. &quot;You have wings too!&quot; She enthused, pointing a hoof at the quivering appendages. &quot;You should totally get up there and be all like <i>woosh!</i> and <i>zoom!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I don&#039;t think I could <i>possibly</i>,&quot; the shy girl answered, shrinking in on herself as she cast uncertain glances between her wings and the other pegasus. &quot;If she can&#039;t do it, then I <i>certainly</i> couldn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t sell yourself short, Shy,&quot; the speedster admonished as she once again levered herself upright. Frowning, she rolled her shoulders in an attempt to loosen them up. &quot;You&#039;re right, though. <i>Probably</i> gonna hold off on the aerial acrobatics for awhile.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps we <i>should</i> turn back,&quot; Rarity considered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, hooey,&quot; Applejack snorted, placing a hoof on the first step. &quot;We went out that door a different species, ain&#039;t no sense turnin&#039; back just &#039;cause we ran into a little trouble. We take this slow an&#039; careful, an&#039; there&#039;s no reason we can&#039;t keep goin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nodding with various shades of conviction, excitement, and reluctance, the group mounted the stairs. Taking their time and watching their steps, they managed to reach the top and push their way through the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;I must say, Applejack,&quot; Rarity commented as she observed their new surroundings. &quot;I&#039;m glad we followed your advice. This is <i>gorgeous</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">The others could only nod in agreement. Where the torchlit corridor they&#039;d started in had been strictly utilitarian, the grand hallway they now stood in was opulent beyond compare. White marble walls were punctuated by tall windows, scattering golden sunlight over beautifully patterned tiles that were polished to a mirror finish. Statues, vases, and beautifully flowering plants sat in alcoves set into the opposite wall. The ceiling, higher than even the gymnasium&#039;s, was gracefully arched and awash in reflected light. Dominating their view was a grand tapestry opposite the door, depicting a snow white horse in flight, her horn seeming to pierce the golden orb of the sun and prismatic mane streaming behind.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow,&quot; Pinkie Pie whispered, her loss for words describing her awe better than any energetic proclamation.</p><p class="double">&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Dash agreed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s beautiful,&quot; Fluttershy added, her own wonderment overshadowing any trepidation she might have felt.</p><p class="double">&quot;This here&#039;s worth the price o&#039; admission all on its own,&quot; the farmer asserted. After a moment she shook her head and frowned slightly as she looked to either end of the hall. &quot;Now which way did she-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You there!&quot; Came an authoritative shout, and the girls&#039; heads whipped around to find a white unicorn in golden plate trotting towards them. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity shook herself out of the shock, taking in the situation in an instant. Whatever her shape, reading others was a talent of hers. Even if she couldn&#039;t read pony body language quite so well as a human&#039;s, she could tell that the approaching stallion was more beleaguered than angry. Her compatriots on the other hand...</p><p class="double">Applejack wore the same look she had whenever any of their parents found them doing something ill-advised, which meant she was going to spill everything. Rainbow Dash looked to have forgotten her recent coordination troubles and was raring for a fight. Fluttershy was trying to become as small as possible and was doing an admirable job of not attracting attention. Pinkie Pie...</p><p class="double">She would admit that her powers of observation failed entirely on that count. Whatever the pinkette did, she gave it fifty-fifty odds on making things better or dooming them all.</p><p class="double">Mentally bracing herself, she stepped forward with what grace she could muster from her unfamiliar body and attempted to project all the confidence of someone who had every right to be there.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m <i>dreadfully</i> sorry, are we not supposed to be here? I&#039;m afraid we must have wandered a bit, distracted as we were by this marvelous decor.&quot; She waved a hoof at the well polished surroundings that they&#039;d just been gawking at.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Sure</i> you did,&quot; the guard snorted derisively as he drew up to them. He leveled a scrutinizing gaze at them before finally shrugging and turning around. &quot;But I suppose there&#039;s no harm done. Come on, I&#039;ll take you back to the party.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity saw Pinkie drawing in a huge breath at the p-word, and preemptively shoved a hoof in her mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yes, that would be lovely,&quot; she added swiftly. &quot;We got rather turned around...&quot;</p><p class="double">The five followed the guard through the palace halls, trying to keep track of their path. Eventually they emerged into a large garden packed with ponies in fine dress mingling. The sun was just beginning to set and firefly lanterns fluttered to life to offer a gentle glow against the gathering dark.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t want to catch you lot &#039;wandering&#039; again,&quot; the stallion who had escorted them admonished. &quot;The Princess was kind enough to allow the grounds to be used for the celebration in her absence, but the palace itself is for official business only, got it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; Rarity agreed. &quot;Once again, we are terribly sorry to have inconvenienced you. I&#039;m sure you have <i>much</i> more important duties to be attending to than helping some lost girls find their way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, don&#039;t worry about it,&quot; he answered, rubbing the back of his neck abashedly. &quot;Just make sure it doesn&#039;t happen again. You ladies have fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright,&quot; Applejack said quietly once the guard had gotten a little ways away. &quot;Now we just gotta wait fer them ta let their guard down, an&#039; we slip in an&#039; get back ta the-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sentry!&quot; The guard barked, striking the back of an orange stallion&#039;s helmet with a hoof. &quot;Are you out here to mingle!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir no sir!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then what <i>is</i> your job!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stand watch and keep civies out of the palace, sir!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So you <i>do</i> know what you&#039;re doing, you just aren&#039;t doing it! Look sharp and don&#039;t let this happen again. Since one pair of eyes apparently isn&#039;t good enough, I&#039;m gonna go find some spares to lend a hoof. I find anypony who doesn&#039;t belong in there again and you&#039;re getting latrine duty until the Gala! Are we clear?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir yes sir!&quot; The younger guard drew himself up and put on a show of sweeping his gaze across the party.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, dang,&quot; Applejack muttered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Darling, you&#039;re staring,&quot; Rarity advised. It hadn&#039;t taken them long to realize that lurking near the palace doors was probably counter productive to getting the guards to relax. Lacking anything better to do, they&#039;d wandered into the party. She and Rainbow Dash had wandered off along the edge of the crowd, curious but not quite adventurous enough to dive straight in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Those,&quot; the athlete bit out, raising a hoof at a trio of ponies in blue. &quot;Are the Wonderbolts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know you know more about the Wonderbolts than anyone living,&quot; the fashionista replied with a raised eyebrow. &quot;But last I checked they weren&#039;t ponies. I don&#039;t think you can even fly a jet with hooves.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who said anything about jets?&quot; Dash asked, flaring her wings. &quot;I don&#039;t think they even need them. Besides, look at the hair. Mane. Whatever. Those are dead ringers for Spitfire and Soarin. And don&#039;t even get me started on the uniforms.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;U-uniforms?&quot; Rarity stuttered, suddenly riveted on the pair of pegasi. &quot;Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear-oh-dear-ohdearoh<i>dearohdear</i>-&quot; Her eyes snapped wildly between the stunt flyers and her own hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, are you alright?&quot; The athlete asked, waving a hoof before her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>No</i>, Rainbow Dash, I am <i>not</i> alright!&quot; She proclaimed before looking around nervously and leaning in to whisper. &quot;<i>We&#039;re naked!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh,&quot; the girl-turned-pony noted, twisting about to look at her flank. &quot;How &#039;bout that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>&#039;How &#039;bout that&#039;?!</i>&quot; Rarity hissed before throwing herself to the ground and covering her head with her hooves. &quot;Of all the worst possible things, this is the <i>worst</i> worst possible thing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, is your friend there alright?&quot; A third party inserted. Rainbow turned to face the interloper and suddenly found she needed to sit down.</p><p class="double">&quot;O-oh, yeah,&quot; she stammered at Soarin. &quot;Just, you know, freaking out because she&#039;s meeting one of her idols and it&#039;s kinda blowing her mind!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, don&#039;t worry about it, happens all the time.&quot; He dug through a pocket in his uniform and produced a pair of autographed photos that he hoofed over. &quot;Always nice to meet a fan. You two have fun!&quot; He waved jovially before trotting back over to Spitfire.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Dash said, staring at the photo in her hooves. &quot;I don&#039;t even care that everything is impossible. This is awesome.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...And this, of course, is my wife Fleur,&quot; Fancy Pants introduced cheerfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it&#039;s a pleasure to meet you,&quot; Fluttershy greeted, gently bumping hooves with the elegant mare. It was odd. Most of the time meeting new people made her nervous and awkward, but here she was mingling and conversing with only the barest trace of worry. It was almost like she was in the shelter feeding the animals.</p><p class="double">She blinked slowly at the thought. That must have been it. No one here really fit her mental picture of &#039;people&#039;, and they were all ever so friendly...</p><p class="double">And she had the distinct urge to find a brush and distribute <i>brushies</i> to <i>everypony</i>.</p><p class="double"><i>This must be how Pinkie feels </i><i><b>all the time</b></i>, she thought with a giggle.</p><p class="double">&quot;And where do you come from?&quot; Fleur asked, shaking her from her thoughts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I guess you could call me a transfer student,&quot; she answered smoothly. &quot;I just got in today and...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Omigosh,&quot; Pinkie exclaimed after hastily consuming a slice of cake. &quot;AJ, you gotta try some of these!&quot; It had gotten past dinner time, and the pair of them had followed their stomachs to the refreshment table.</p><p class="double">&quot;All them desserts look a little frou-frou fer me,&quot; Applejack dismissed. Pinkie might have had a metabolism that ran entirely off of high fructose corn syrup, but the farmer required something a hair more substantial. &quot;Where in tarnation are the pigs in blankets,&quot; she muttered as she examined the spread. &quot;Only kind o&#039; horse-de-vors Ah like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, oh, how about these?&quot; Applejack turned to see what had gotten the party girl all worked up and blinked as she saw the vibrant green stem with a few petals attached sticking out her mouth. She proceeded to slurp it up like a noodle.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Pinkie,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Ah don&#039;t think yer supposed ta eat the center piece.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, silly,&quot; Pinkie answered, pointing at a tray. &quot;They&#039;re itty bitty daisy sandwiches! I totally thought they were some kind of weird salad arrangement, but nope! Totally daisies, and totally delicious!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh.&quot; The farmer pondered the tray a moment before reaching out with a hoof against her better judgement. This was shortly followed by her staring at her hoof in vague confusion before shrugging and awkwardly taking a sandwich with her teeth. &quot;Not bad,&quot; she admitted a moment later.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know! Crazy right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me get at one of them hay thingies,&quot; Applejack said, deciding she might as well just run with it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s everyone gettin&#039; all worked up over?&quot; Dash asked as the crowd congregated in the east side of the gardens. Everyone seemed to be jockeying for position next to the railing overlooking the mountainside.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, sunrise of course,&quot; Fancy Pants answered. Rarity had eventually gotten over her panic attack and joined Fluttershy in what appeared to be high culture.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunrise,&quot; Applejack deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve been up all night,&quot; Rarity noted.</p><p class="double">&quot;My parents are gonna <i>kill</i> me,&quot; Dash groaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Pinkie agreed with a cheerful disregard for consequences. &quot;The Cakes are gonna <i>flip</i>. Totally worth it, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Fluttershy agreed. &quot;This has been wonderful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, yeah, reckon so,&quot; the farmer agreed. Further conversation was cut off as the crowd&#039;s murmurings first rose and then cut off entirely. A moment later the entire group joined in a countdown.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;...Three! Two! One! Happy Solstice!&quot;</i> Exuberant shouts soon gave way to confused mumblings and checking of watches. As the seconds stretched longer and longer, panic began seeping in.</p><p class="double">For the first time in a thousand years, the sun failed to rise.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia, widely agreed to be serenity incarnate, was struggling to maintain her composure. It had been difficult, facing what her sister had become, but she had braced herself. It had been worse, waiting imprisoned and knowing that her student was all that stood between her little ponies and the wrath of a tyrant, but she had endured. It had been glorious, retaking her freedom and knowing it meant Equestria was safe, but she contained her joy.</p><p class="double">And then the pony before her had thrown back the hood of her cloak.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunset Shimmer,&quot; she murmured. In all her planning, all her contingencies, all her dreams and nightmares of this day, she had never foreseen this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess,&quot; her former student answered quietly, refusing to meet her gaze. &quot;I ran away to seek power. And... And I found it,&quot; she gave a strangled sob. &quot;I found <i>so much</i>. But no matter how strong I got, no matter how far I went, all I really wanted was to come home.&quot; She pressed herself to the ground. &quot;I&#039;m s-so s-sorry!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know not what her crimes were, sister,&quot; a voice she hadn&#039;t heard in a thousand years added. Luna limped towards them, a contrite expression written across her features. &quot;But they cannot possibly equal my own. She held my darker self at bay while the Elements were gathered, which surely absolves any sins she might hold. Whatever quarrel you have, it is with me.&quot; The Princess of the night straightened and stared her elder sibling in the eye, but Celestia had long ago learned when her sister was putting on a brave face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Since I lost you,&quot; the solar diarch spoke. &quot;All I&#039;ve wanted was your return.&quot; Stepping between them, she curled her wings around the pair. &quot;<i>Both</i> of you.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The royal carriage was just a bit cramped on its return trip to Canterlot. The royal sisters riding together was a given. Celestia had insisted that Sunset join them, despite the mare&#039;s insistence that she could get back on her own. She&#039;d also insisted on taking Twilight with them, refusing to prioritize one student over the other.</p><p class="double">It was a small favor that there&#039;d been a second carriage on hand for the rest of the Element Bearers, or else they&#039;d have had to start stacking ponies on top of each other to fit them all.</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s eyes had been darting about for the entire trip, drinking in the changes that had been made since her imprisonment. Suddenly, as they crossed onto the palace grounds, she found herself riveted upon a single sight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sister,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Why have the ponies been doubled?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, much more than doubled,&quot; Celestia chuckled. &quot;There&#039;s been quite the population boom while you were gone.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, sister,&quot; Luna insisted, raising a hoof to point.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh dear,&quot; the sun Princess exclaimed upon sighting the five perfect copies of the Bearers. &quot;That <i>is</i> unusual.&quot; She twisted her head around and confirmed that the second chariot hadn&#039;t somehow beaten them to the palace. &quot;Twilight, did your new friends happen to mention something about having identical twins in Canterlot?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Princess,&quot; Twilight answered as she raised an eyebrow in Sunset&#039;s direction. &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure they never mentioned anything like that.&quot; The pair of carriages descended at Celestia&#039;s signal, coming to a halt just before the crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;Those portals usually close themselves...&quot; Sunset mumbled sheepishly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then these are your friends?&quot; The solar princess asked. &quot;The very counterparts of the Bearers, the odds must be astronomical...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not exactly, Princess,&quot; the orange unicorn answered, lowering her eyes. She didn&#039;t get a chance to elaborate, as it was at that moment that a pink blur launched itself from the other chariot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Quick Twilight!&quot; Pinkie shouted, having bowled over several ponies to tackle her counterpart. &quot;Destroy us both before my evil twin dooms us all!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie,&quot; the scholar answered in exasperation. &quot;She&#039;s not your evil twin.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s not?&quot; Ponyville&#039;s premier party pony let loose a massive gasp. &quot;<i>But that must mean-</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not the evil twin either,&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. True neutral triplet? Lawful quintuplet?&quot; The other Pinkie was wide eyed, head darting back and forth as she followed the exchange.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can assure you,&quot; the Anchor said with mock gravitas. &quot;That the two of you have never shared a womb.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Pinkie answered sagely. &quot;That can only mean one thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Body-double double-party!</i>&quot; The pair of pinkettes chorused together, standing up and hooking forehooves around each other&#039;s shoulders as confetti showered the area.</p><p class="double">While the duo had worked towards their inevitable declaration of intent to party, the other Bearers had made their way over to the group of doppelgangers as Twilight, Sunset, and the Princesses stood a little ways off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup,&quot; Rainbow declared after spending a few moments buzzing about her opposite number with a scrutinizing gaze. &quot;I&#039;m even <i>more</i> awesome from the outside.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, I&#039;m not so bad myself,&quot; her counterpart agreed. The suspicious glare she&#039;d been shooting her other self transmuted into a self satisfied smirk as she ran a hoof through her mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dash, could ya <i>not</i> compliment yerself like that?&quot; The Element of Honesty asked even as her double looked her over. &quot;It&#039;s just a mite weird.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope,&quot; the ground bound pegasus countered. &quot;<i>That&#039;s</i> weird.&quot; She raised a hoof towards the pair of pale yellow pegasi.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my goodness,&quot; the girl-turned-mare enthused as she stroked her counterpart&#039;s mane. &quot;You are the most adorable thing I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot; The other Fluttershy only squeaked in response, having gone stock still the instant touching had started.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll just go rescue Fluttershy, shall I?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll just go pry off Fluttershy, shall I?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pair of Rarities blinked as they spoke simultaneously. They gave each other a measuring glance before shrugging and trotting over to their respective Fluttershys.</p><p class="double">&quot;I reckon I oughta warn y&#039;all,&quot; the Applejack from beyond the mirror stated. &quot;If yer intendin&#039; ta use our faces as a vangard of alien invasion, y&#039;all got another thing comin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Funny,&quot; the native pony shot back. &quot;I was jus&#039; &#039;bout ta tell ya the same thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You look like you&#039;re in a good mood, all things considered,&quot; Twilight noted, trotting over to her predecessor.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s just nice to see them getting along again,&quot; Sunset said with a sad little smile. &quot;I know they&#039;re probably like this with you all the time, but the only time I&#039;ve interacted with them was when I spent <i>years</i> systematically ruining their lives and driving them apart.&quot; She lowered her eyes and fidgeted awkwardly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, none of that,&quot; the Anchor scolded, sitting down next to her and bumping shoulders. &quot;I know it seems like a big deal now, but the fact that you care is proof that you&#039;re not that pony anymore. Besides,&quot; she teased, &quot;I&#039;ve been friends with <i>much</i> bigger monsters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Sunset rolled her eyes. &quot;Now you&#039;ve gone and made me feel inadequate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it&#039;s true. I&#039;ve even been friends with...&quot; She leaned in conspiratorially and whispered &quot;<i>Prince Blueblood.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset couldn&#039;t help but snort with laughter. Her first two Loops may have been all jumbled up in her mind, but she remembered Blueblood from both of them. &quot;Yeah, I guess if anyone&#039;s gonna upstage a self-absorbed power-hungry princess-wannabe, it&#039;s gonna be him.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really, though, I&#039;m glad to have you back. If you want, it shouldn&#039;t be too hard to move you into Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, but...&quot; She looked over the five ponies that had followed her through the mirror and bit her lip thoughtfully. &quot;I think I&#039;ll have to take a rain check on that.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Are you certain you wish to do this?&quot; Celestia asked as they entered the mirror&#039;s chamber. &quot;You&#039;re more than welcome to stay at the palace. With Twilight moving to Ponyville you could even have your old rooms back.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, Princess, but you&#039;re not the only person I&#039;ve wronged.&quot; She looked meaningfully at the ponies following them through the door. &quot;I&#039;ve got a lot to make up for.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw heck,&quot; Applejack answered, scuffing her hoof against the ground. &quot;If Ah&#039;ve learned anthin&#039; today, it&#039;s that landin&#039; on a new world with a weird body can be a mite stressful. I reckon I can see why ya&#039;d go a little crazy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, the whole secretly-an-alien-pony-wizard thing?&quot; Rainbow Dash added, &quot;you&#039;re not as lame as I thought.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ll just have to throw a super-duper big party to let everypony know that-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold on,&quot; Twilight interrupted. The pink mare was wrapped in purple magic and floated out the door, soon replaced by her doppelganger. &quot;Continue.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awww...&quot; Came the twin cries as the pair&#039;s plans were foiled, but Pinkie perked up a moment later. &quot;Still throwing that party!&quot; Further musings on celebrations were cut off as a struggling Fluttershy was brought in by another cloud of magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please don&#039;t make me go,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I belong here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I, um, suppose you could come back,&quot; the local Pegasus answered nervously from across the threshold. &quot;If you tone it down. Just a little. Please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Field trips aren&#039;t out of the question,&quot; Sunset agreed. A moment later Rarity, bringing up the rear, trotted over and whispered a question. &quot;Yes, Rarity,&quot; she rolled her eyes. &quot;Your clothes <i>will</i> come back when you go though the portal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I certainly don&#039;t see reason why you couldn&#039;t return to Equestria now and again,&quot; Celestia agreed. &quot;In fact, I would very much like it if the both of you,&quot; she nodded to her students, &quot;would send me reports on your studies in friendship.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, Princess, I&#039;d be-&quot;</p><p class="double">It was at that moment that a mint green unicorn tumbled out of the mirror, trailing a rope that was fastened securely around her waist.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry girls!&quot; Lyra proclaimed, &quot;I&#039;m comin&#039; for- Holy crap I&#039;m a unicorn!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I <i>really</i> need to remember to close doors behind me,&quot; Sunset lamented as she covered her face with a hoof. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>102.1 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;... and arrangements have been made for you to stay-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In the library, I know, I know,&quot; Twilight muttered. Another Lonely Loop, apparently baseline.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... what? Who lives in a public library?&quot; Spike asked. &quot;No, Princess Celestia apparently rented a room from Mr. and Mrs. Cake at a place called Sugar Cube Corner.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle&#039;s brain jumped the tracks. Not living in the library? Twilight ALWAYS lived in the library. A Loop had to go a long way off of baseline for her to not live in that poor doomed library.</p><p class="double">But... wait...</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t <i>her</i> library anymore.</p><p class="double">And if it wasn&#039;t hers anymore... maybe it wasn&#039;t doomed anymore.</p><p class="double">Twilight thought she felt the smile of hope spread across her face. Spike&#039;s reaction told her it was an entirely different smile, and she struggled to shape it into a more reassuring shape.</p><p class="double">Still, she felt so bucking cheerful that she smiled and waved her way through the entire Summer Sun Celebration preparations. The surprise Pinkie party was especially fun this time, and she capped it off with a defeat of Nightmare Moon through the calculated use of two fresh eggs, three teaspoons of salt, a net made of used chewing gum, and a slingshot.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot; Carrot Cake said quietly, &quot;we&#039;ve enjoyed having you stay with us the past year. You&#039;ve been almost as helpful as Pinkie Pie. But, well...&quot; The elder stallion shuffled his feet uncomfortably. &quot;The foals are about to arrive, and we need your room for the nursery. So I&#039;m afraid we have to ask you to move out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand, Mr. Cake,&quot; Twilight nodded. In truth she felt a bit relieved. As much as she enjoyed the idea of the library not blowing up, she hadn&#039;t wanted to bring doom and destruction to Sugar Cube Corner, either.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, we didn&#039;t want to leave you high and dry,&quot; Cup Cake said, putting a hoof on Twilight&#039;s shoulder. &quot;We already arranged for the Princess&#039;s living stipend to go towards an apartment in the new high-rise they built right next to the town library! That&#039;ll be so convenient for you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll have your own kitchen and bathroom and everything!&quot; Carrot Cake said. &quot;No more waiting for Pinkie Pie to clean out the ring Gummy leaves in the tub!&quot;</p><p class="double">As nice as the theory was, the first thing Twilight Sparkle discovered when she entered her new apartment was Pinkie taking a bath. The fresh cucpcakes in the kitchen made up for it, though.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tirek&#039;s fireball brushed past Twilight Sparkle&#039;s wingtip, singing a couple of primaries before rocketing into Ponyville.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s jaw dropped as she realized the fireball&#039;s arc would take it to the center of the town... and Sugar Cube Corner.</p><p class="double">Two hurried teleports later, Twilight had all four of the Cake family under her hooves when the fireball struck. Sugar Cube Corner was blown to pieces, the largest being the heavy fireproof roof, which flew off into the air and across the city.</p><p class="double">Rising up, Twilight watched as the tile roof slammed into the top of her brick apartment building. The tall structure rocked, swayed, and crumbled at the base, finally falling over onto its side.</p><p class="double">The top four stories hit the oak-tree library and smashed it flat.</p><p class="double">The general good feeling she&#039;d had the entire Loop didn&#039;t evaporate. It inverted. It folded in upon itself in emotional Escher shapes, collapsing into the fury of far too many Loops&#039; worth of frustrated anger.</p><p class="double">Twilight flew into the air, gathering raw power between her hooves. The syllables she chanted crashed against the Equestrian landscape like the footsteps of a giant wearing house slippers.</p><p class="double"><i><b>&quot;KA... ME... HA... ME...&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Not long after, Princess Luna caused a small plaque to be raised on the moon. It read:</p><p class="double"><i>NIGHTMARE MOON</i></p><p><i>Sent to the Moon by the magic of the Elements of Harmony</i></p><p class="double"><i>TIREK</i></p><p><i>Got here the hard way</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.2 (Compiled by Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">(yannoshka)</p><p class="double">&quot;Ok, new round...The most interesting loop where old man Henderson, or variation thereof appeared.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike massaged his temples as he went on first.</p><p class="double">&quot;Old Sullustan Henderson - and yes it was as weird as it sounds. To start with he single-handedly stole ol&#039; wrinkleface&#039;s personal yacht from Coruscant, somehow manged to run it by himself all around the galaxy searching for Tarkin until he more or less stumbled to them just before they were going to blow up Alderaan and proceeded to purposefully crash it into mk I Death Star, all the while raving over all the com channels about his &#039;wee people&#039;. I&#039;ll leave it to your imaginations how it went from there...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(namar13766)</p><p class="double">Sunset looked slightly shifty.</p><p class="double">&quot;Old Mare Granny Smith. She trained Tank to become a Changeling-hunting ninja, took over the Crystal Empire by using the Crystal Heart and singing &#039;The Touch,&#039; and she used your library, as a physical weapon, to knock Tirek back into Tartarus. And before you ask Twilight, no, it wasn&#039;t destroyed, and you weren&#039;t Awake for that loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac had a thousand yard stare.</p><p class="double">&quot;Old Mare Granny Smith stopped a G3.5 Bureau loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Shining Armor smiled, though it didn&#039;t reach his eyes. &quot;None of you have ever been Ultraman Henderson.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bar fell silent as everypony contemplated this. Finally, Twilight asked, &quot;DC or Tokusatsu?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The latter.&quot; Shining shook his head and took a long draw from his beer. &quot;Lawn gnomes should not be an indispensable weapon in the fight against evil.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord snorted. &quot;Says you.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;Weeell, I was in a loop where old man Henderson appeared,&quot; Pinkie Pie exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Twilight spoke up, &quot;You were Hastur.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was totally Hastur,&quot; Pinkie nodded with a smile, &quot;I had my party cult help him get his lawn gnomes back from the evil charity auction that he had donated them to. There were fun times and explosions and malevolent girl scouts everywhere. Then we had a rock n&#039; roll dance party together followed by ice skating.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s... interesting,&quot; the lavender unicorn said diplomatically.</p><p class="double">&quot;The only problem was that they didn&#039;t have any ice skates in a size shoggoth.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(KrisOverstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot;</p><p class="double">Every head turned to look at Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know what Loop it was,&quot; the yellow pegasus murmured. &quot;I was in a cafe in a London suburb. There was sort of a... thing... a lot of voices in my mind. I didn&#039;t quite understand, so I sat down in a cafe, ordered some tea, and tried to think it through.</p><p class="double">&quot;And then these great ugly black ships appeared in the sky and just hovered there. Everybody began to panic except for this one person at the table next to mine, who pulled this beepy thing out of a satchel and waved it in the air. And then there was this booming voice that said...&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy took a breath, and her whispery murmur shifted to bold, brassy, loud tones that almost knocked her fellow Loopers off their flanks. &quot;<i>SO, YEZ DAFTIE GOBSHITE EARTHLIN&#039;S, WHAT&#039;S YEZ DOON WI&#039; ME GNOMES?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">As the others recovered, Fluttershy continued in her normal voice, &quot;Right after that I was swept up in this transporter beam and onto one of the ships. Turns out they were from the planet Hin-Dursa. The voice we heard was their leader... the Old Man of the Hin-Dursan.&quot;</p><p class="double">A few groans echoed through the room. Twilight asked, &quot;So what happened next?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, my new friend and I went straight to the Old Man so I could give him a piece of my mind,&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;After all, it&#039;s not nice to threaten the destruction of a planet, no matter how nice one&#039;s missing garden gnomes are. But just as the Old Man was apologizing, his hand slipped and he hit the attack button.&quot; Fluttershy shrugged. &quot;He was very sorry about it afterwards. He&#039;s actually quite nice when he&#039;s not... er... plastered,&quot; she finished in an embarrassed squeak.</p><p class="double">&quot;And... that&#039;s all?&quot; Rainbow Dash folded her forelegs across her barrel. &quot;That&#039;s not very interesting!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, the interesting part came afterwards!&quot; Fluttershy said eagerly. &quot;The Old Man dropped us off at the next star over. There I was able to talk some very nice dolphins into replacing the Earth at just the right moment so that nobody even got hurt. I wrote an article about it, and an editor read it and offered me a job!</p><p class="double">&quot;I got to spend the next ten years, not counting time travel, researching all sorts of new planets and cataloging new life forms! That&#039;s where I got the idea for my encyclopedia of Equestrian animals! I learned how to speak with ballpoint pens and mattresses! It was so interesting working for the great Book!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But all Old Man Henderson did was invade Earth and blow it up with an alien battle fleet, right?&quot; Rainbow Dash insisted. &quot;No weird weapons? No strange coincidences? No absurd levels of collateral damage? That&#039;s boring! Anypony could do that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The dare didn&#039;t say Henderson had to be the interesting part of the Loop,&quot; Fluttershy insisted. &quot;It only asks about the most interesting Loop we&#039;ve had that had Henderson in it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The general shifting of chairs and lack of attention showed that Fluttershy&#039;s argument had been weighed and rejected by the judges.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I thought it was interesting,&quot; she muttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;So do I!&quot; Twilight insisted, smiling. &quot;What&#039;s this great Book you were working for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you know the Book!&quot; Fluttershy insisted. &quot;Everyone knows about the Book!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which book?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;The Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that thing,&quot; Twilight said, turning her attention to the next Looper&#039;s story.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy pouted and pulled her towel out of her subspace pocket. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, Maria Terrycloth,&quot; she told it. &quot;We still understand each other.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(feral wolfskin)</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll looked at the others Loopers. &quot;Old Dragon Henderson attacked Ponyville one loop. After I managed to prove that the Changelings were the true thieves and helped to recuperate his hoard of lawn gnomes we become friends and exchanged letters for the rest of the loop.&quot; She produced a few letters from her subspace pocket &quot;And no, nopony else was Awake that I knew.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(WyldeHorse)</p><p class="double">&quot;Allright, so, I know we&#039;re not supposed to talk about the Bureau, but I have to mention this one,&quot; Twilight said, taking a fortifying gulp from her cup. &quot;So, started out pretty standard. I was getting ready to derail things, except then the serum came out early... And turned everyone that took it into an Old Mare - or Old Stallion, as the case may be - Henderson. ALL OF THEM. And then, once there&#039;s a BUNCH of Hendersons, the space zombies show up. Seriously. I just... I don&#039;t even know.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac looked at her, and slid a large tankard her way. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.3 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;To answer your questions, this is a peppermint pylon,&quot; Pinkie Pie patted a three-story tall candy cane, &quot;It creates a bubble full of video game universe laws. Pain is muted and death just causes you to respawn. There might also be power-ups that appear every so often. One time, these giant flying cherries appeared and I chased them around and then suddenly I was surrounded by hungry ghosts. I giggled at them, but then a floating power candy ball appeared and I ate it and then things got weird.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, I didn&#039;t ask any questions yet,&quot; Lyra sat down on the cool forest floor of Whitetail Woods. Ditzy sat across from her, looking at Pinkie as she babbled off topic.</p><p class="double">&#039;It&#039;s not off topic,&#039; came the inner voice of Lyra&#039;s human self, &#039;She&#039;s describing the video game, &#039;Pacman&#039;.&#039;</p><p class="double">&#039;Apparently, there&#039;s some bleed-through from imposing another universe&#039;s laws onto this one,&#039; said the voice of Cyborg Scientist/Master Thief Lyra, &#039;That&#039;s actually worrisome.&#039;</p><p class="double">&#039;I think it&#039;s really neat!&#039; piped in Seapony Lyra at the collective mind, &#039;You can go all out and not worry about things like dying from your own power or massive collateral damage.&#039;</p><p class="double">Pinkie chose this moment to finish saying what she was talking about.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, can you repeat that. I was distracted by my mental constructs.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know how that is!&quot; Pinkie nodded sagely, &quot;I was saying that you asked for combat training, so I though, &#039;Pinkie, what&#039;s the best way to train a pony in combat in Equestria.&#039; and that&#039;s when I cooked up the peppermint pylon and invited you and Ditzy out here. Ditzy, do you have any objections to help train Lyra?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope. It sounds fun, actually,&quot; the pegasus smiled, &quot;And I need to blow off some steam from that last loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened?&quot; Lyra asked. All her inner selves were concerned about her fellow looper and friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;I remember unawake me getting into a fight with Berry Punch that almost cost us our friendship. I even sic-ed an unawake Pinkie Pie at her. Sorry about that, Pinkie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s no problemo,&quot; the baker pony waved her hoof dismissively.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re still getting non-looping you&#039;s memories, Ditzy?&quot; Lyra asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, but they&#039;re not so bad. Usually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I still feel terrible for shoving you and Sunset and Vinyl into the loops,&quot; the mint green pony&#039;s head was bent low to the ground in sadness.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t feel bad, Lyra. There&#039;s nothing to forgive. I don&#039;t mind being a looper, and neither do Vinyl and Sunset.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Besides,&#039; thought human Lyra with glee, &#039;we figured out that shape-shifting spell and then Sunset Shimmer agreed to our request. We finally got to ride on a real live unicorn!&#039;</p><p class="double">Baseline Lyra sighed mentally, &#039;We ARE a real live unicorn.&#039;</p><p class="double">Human Lyra humphed, &#039;Stop crushing our dreams!&#039;</p><p class="double">Pinkie chose this moment to stop observing Lyra&#039;s silently twitching face and piped up, &quot;Any-who, to train you in fighty-fighty time; you&#039;ll battle Ditzy and then you&#039;ll get better.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s it?&quot; Lyra asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup. Pretty much,&quot; the pink pony pulled out a massive tub of popcorn out of her mane, &quot;I&#039;m just going to sit here and keep score.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra and Ditzy looked at each other.</p><p class="double">The unicorn spoke first, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure!&quot;</p><p class="double">And without any warning, Lyra blasted out a concussion beam from her horn. It missed by a wide margin as Ditzy immediately rocketed up into the air and did a series of impossible looking maneuvers. Then, she folded up her wings and shot downwards right at the unicorn at peregrine falcon speeds. Lyra widened her eyes as she tried to dodge.</p><p class="double">Lyra opened her eyes and saw that she was standing a building&#039;s length away from her own rapidly fading carcass. Ditzy lifted her clean hoof and giggled, &quot;No mess, no fuss.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, time for round two,&quot; Lyra announced and charged, following the advice of a more direct approach from her baseline self.</p><p class="double">Ditzy flapped her wings and accelerated right at her. Lyra saw the grey pony&#039;s wings were cutting through the air without any turbulence. That meant invisible air blades honed to a razor&#039;s sharpness by pegasus magic. She tried to dodge while putting up a kinetic shield that would hopefully block...</p><p class="double">Lyra opened her eyes and saw both halves of her former body fading from view, &quot;Round three.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy laughed again and nodded.</p><p class="double">Lyra soon learned why pegasi were the predominant military arm of the three pony tribes. They were blindingly fast and if they had a little bit of open space to work with, extremely manoeuvrable. Also a pegasus&#039; natural toughness scaled up with how fast they were going, provided they braced themselves during impact. Ironically, that meant that they could plow into the ground at terminal velocity without getting a single scratch, but an uncontrolled tumble at a much slower speed could break bones. None of that knowledge actually helped against Ditzy who, in addition to being able to create wing air blades, tornadoes, and hit with the force of a freight train, could also spit out bubbles that exploded with the force of a grenade, create bubble clones and decoys, and had an evasive flight pattern that could be considered insanely erratic at best. Lyra did remember that even in baseline, the grey pegasus was good enough to be a competitor of both the young flyers competition and in the Equestria games.</p><p class="double">&quot;Round I stopped counting a while ago,&quot; Lyra panted. So far the score was Ditzy, a lot; Lyra, nothing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ready,&quot; the mailmare seemed to be still full of energy and having fun.</p><p class="double">&#039;I got an idea,&#039; chimed in Lyra&#039;s seapony self, &#039;I&#039;ll need control of our unicorn magic for this.&#039;</p><p class="double">Lyra concentrated and felt her magic alter and twist under the seapony&#039;s guidance. Then she could sense it - water. In the air, in the soil, in her body, farther away in Ditzy, and in Pinkie and her giant slushie drink. Lyra felt the water vapor condense as two large bluish wings made of the liquid formed on the sides of her barrel. With a slow flap, the winged unicorn rose up into the air.</p><p class="double">&#039;I remember how magic flowed through them when we looped in as a pegasus, but..,&#039; seapony Lyra&#039;s statement trailed off.</p><p class="double">&#039;I got it!&#039; human Lyra took control of the wings and their magic. Out of all of her personalities, it was her human self that was the best in the air. Lyra did a few practice loops and maneuvers, &#039;This is kind of fun. Ha! I just did a barrel roll!&#039;</p><p class="double">&#039;Seapony, you got control of the horn blaster. Thief, you&#039;re on shields and deflectors. Baseline, you got situational awareness and oversight,&#039; human Lyra&#039;s mental grin turned predatory, &#039;Now let&#039;s get her!&#039;</p><p class="double">Lyra shot up into the air, blasting at her surprised and frantically evading opponent. Ditzy avoided most of the beams. One came close enough to scorch her tail while another singed a few of her primary feathers. Then she whirled around and sped right at the charging unicorn. Again, Lyra recognized the telltale signs of wing blades, but this time she concentrated into creating her own version.</p><p class="double">Then there was no more time as the two ponies met and crossed in midair. Lyra&#039;s fluid-composed wing reformed in an instant, erasing any damage it suffered.</p><p class="double">Ditzy&#039;s severed wing fluttered downwards in an uncontrolled spiral, followed by Ditzy, herself.</p><p class="double">Human Lyra angled the shared body downwards to follow, &#039;Now, Seapony, finish her off!&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;One finisher move blast coming right up,&#039; the seapony persona said as a massive beam blasted off towards the out of control one-winged pegasus.</p><p class="double">Then there was a flash of light and Lyra was forcibly reminded of a certain fact. Ditzy could ascend to alicorn anytime she wanted to.</p><p class="double">Alicorn Ditzy, now with both wings intact, stabilized her flight and glared at the oncoming beam. Then she screamed, and a rapidly expanding spherical wave of pure entropy burst forth from her body. Lyra&#039;s beam hit the oncoming wave of oblivion and winked out like a candle while the wave continued inexorably onwards.</p><p class="double">Lyra whipped around and raced away to try and outrun the wave of nothingness, all of her selves thinking along the line of, &#039;Oh my frond! It&#039;s coming right at..!&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Congratulations!&quot; Pinkie Pie hopped in front of the newly respawned Lyra. Ditzy landed gracefully and shifted back into her pegasus form.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why?&quot; Lyra said dejectedly, &quot;I didn&#039;t win even once.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you did get much better at combat. That&#039;s what you wanted, right? You even made those water wings and flew.&quot;</p><p class="double">Human Lyra started laughing, explaining that water wings were another term for those inflatable armband pool floaties that toddlers and foals used to learn to swim.</p><p class="double">&quot;It was fun,&quot; Ditzy stated with a smile, &quot;and you did get better each time. I had to become an alicorn to beat you that last time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra nodded with a slowly spreading smile of her own, &quot;It actually was fun, wasn&#039;t it. We&#039;ll definitely have to do it again sometime.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;I don&#039;t know about you three,&#039; thought seapony Lyra, &#039;but I had... a blast!&#039;</p><p class="double">This was followed by a series of mental groans, and the thought construct of human Lyra&#039;s pillow hitting the seapony&#039;s face. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.4 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Discord Awoke, and quickly came to what he would later call Realization One: he was a pony. Not just a pony, an alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no,&quot; he muttered. Thus far, the Loops hadn&#039;t been content with merely making him an alicorn. No, there were always further complications on top of that.</p><p class="double">The Loop memories started coming in, and with them Realization B: he was the only pony in a nation of draconequi.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no.&quot; This time it was a moan. He&#039;d done this song and dance before, and he really wasn&#039;t looking forward to being the spirit of malicious order.</p><p class="double">Then the memories, of which there were millennia worth, got to recent affairs, later classified as Realization Fish: this Loop, he was Prince Maelstrom. As his hurricane-symbol cutie mark indicated, he was the eye of the storm, the calm center around which draconequus culture revolved. Without him, the entire nation of Erisia would probably fly apart in a million different shades of chaos.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, sweet sycamore, no!&quot; It was worse than Discord could&#039;ve ever imagined. It was, in fact, the. Worst. Possible. Thing.</p><p class="double">He had responsibility. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.5 (novusordomund)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>pew pew. pew pew.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, currently a very small purple space ship, weaved back and forth, blasting the insectile enemies to pixellated dust. While she would have normally shied away at killing beings, even invading ones, she had been ensured by this loop&#039;s Admin that they were not alive, and thus killing them was a guilt-free experience. Even when one rammed into her and blew her up, she felt nothing more than a tingling sensation.</p><p class="double"><i>pew pew!</i></p><p class="double">Twilight was surprised when one stopped and caught her into a tractor beam, taking her last ship back with it into the formation of invaders that she was fighting against. She sighed, as she heard a voice inside her head.</p><p class="double"><i>So, how do you enjoy this safe-loop, Thetan Sparkle</i>?</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle &quot;looked up&quot;, for lack of a better term, to the sound of the voice.</p><p class="double"><i>Very well, thank you. </i>She thought. <i>This is one of the Loops you administrate?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Yes. This, and a few other small Loops, are my test.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Test? </i>Twilight asked.</p><p class="double"><i>I am actually one of the lesser-known Admin in Yggsdrasil. Before this, my main job consisted of getting the other Admins their coffee and running messages. However, I recently convinced one of the other Admins to recommend me for a Loop or two. </i>There was a sigh, before the conversation continued. <i>However, I am not taken very seriously by the older Admins, and admittedly for good reason. So, this is my test. A few game safe-loops to let Anchors and Loopers relax and indulge themselves. As long as I don&#039;t blow up my Loops with hydrogen bombs or other such things that would cause stress for the Admins, they will be happy with whatever I do here.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Remind me to never let you meet Trixie. </i>Twilight said, as she could feel her &quot;self&quot; respawning<i>. But I hope you succeed, Xenu. </i></p><p class="double"><i>I do as well, Thetan Sparkle. Please remember that to keep enjoying this game, you must pay twenty-five cents per session.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight would have raised an eyebrow if she could at this statement, as a chuckle went through her mind.</p><p class="double"><i>Do not worry. This one, as they say, is on the house.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight mentally shrugged, as the three bugs detached from their formation at her.</p><p class="double"><i>pew pew!</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.6 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">It was Twilight&#039;s last night in the library, before she moved into the castle, until the plunder vine incident, and she had been up late going over this loop&#039;s plans to try saving it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Awaken, Twilight Sparkle! We need your aid!&quot; Thus, she was understandably confused when somepony shook her awake.</p><p class="double">Opening her eyes, Twilight was met with mostly blackness. Reaching over to slap her nightstand light on, she saw the clock glowing in the darkness. She had only been asleep for two hours, and the sun wasn&#039;t coming up for another three.</p><p class="double">Bleary eyed, she turned back to the pony that had been shaking her. Sitting on her bed with her, was a very frazzled looking Princess Luna. &quot;Please, Twilight Sparkle, you are Our only hope.&quot; She pleaded.</p><p class="double">&quot;First, coffee. Second, I&#039;ll help.&quot; Rubbing her eyes with her free hoof, Twilight noticed one other problem. &quot;Third, get off me.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">One long range teleport later, Twilight (and her blanket) were sitting at a table in one of Equestria&#039;s many Sunkicks. Luna rejoined her at the table, bearing the bearclaws and large cup of coffee Twilight had demanded.</p><p class="double">As Luna sat down to cradle her own coffee cup, Twilight reflected that they must be quite the sight, one princess with obvious bed-mane wrapped in a blanket, the other looking like she&#039;d not slept in days. Finishing her first bite, Twilight finally asked. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You ascended. It all started back then, right before the coronation. All that paperwork.&quot; Luna began, looking into her mug with a distant expression. &quot;It was just the one, just to help get us through. Then there were two, but we didn&#039;t stop them, because there was still so much work. Now... Now we&#039;re out of work to do. The things they&#039;ve done with the tax code... We&#039;re currently keeping them busy with Griffonia&#039;s tax code, but it won&#039;t last.</p><p class="double">They&#039;re not like her, not like she was. They&#039;re all intelligent, helpful, <i>sane</i>. We didn&#039;t even realize what was happening, not until it was... There&#039;s dozens of them now, do you understand? And they&#039;re all so... We don&#039;t know which one&#039;s the real one anymore! And neither do they!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna, calm down, you&#039;re not making sense.&quot; Reaching across the table, Twilight touched Luna&#039;s hoof. &quot;Who&#039;s not real? What are you talking about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia. The Mirror Pool...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Convincing them to let her try and find the real one, and send the rest of the Celestias back into the Pool, had been easy. Convincing them of her method, less so. But she did it, and now she stood alongside Luna on a beach, in the early morning light.</p><p class="double">&quot;This will work? I do not think she&#039;s ever done anything like this before, you are sure this will work?&quot; Luna asked her, once again. She had been even more dubious of Twilight&#039;s plan than the collective Celestias had been.</p><p class="double">&quot;It will. I told you before, she can do this. The skill is there, even if she doesn&#039;t know she has it yet.&quot; Twilight assured, as she turned from where Pinkie had set up with some local beach colts she&#039;d recruited. Looking out across the waves, she saw them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here they come. Pinkie!&quot; Twilight charged her horn, as she pointed at her friend. &quot;Hit it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twirling her drumsticks, Pinkie smiled as her band awaited her cue. &quot;Ah hahahahaha, wipe out!&quot;</p><p class="double">The music started, and the first ever Celestial Surf-Off began. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Trixie was busy packing up for her trip out of Trottingham when the door to her wagon burst open and a black alicorn stormed in.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am having very mixed feelings!&quot; the alicorn announced, slumping onto the showmare&#039;s vanity cabinet. &quot;You know that, Trixie? Very mixed feelings right about now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The showmare took in the situation, glanced outside the wagon for a moment, and shut the door. &quot;Do tell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know how some loops Changelings are just &#039;cursed ponies?&#039;&quot; The alicorn snorted. &quot;Well, this is one of those loops. Except the curse in question was made to be lifted once I felt true love.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s... sweet,&quot; Trixie managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, sweet. All my people are celebrating now that the curse has been lifted, and the worst part! The worst part is I can&#039;t even explain why it feels so insulting!&quot; She smacked her head against the wall. &quot;To have my whole race reduced to a magical disease... Honestly, Trixie, I&#039;m happy for them but their happiness is so... INFURIATING!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded in understanding. &quot;That does sound like a major conflict of interest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... at least I still have you to talk to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. You do.&quot; Trixie cleared her throat awkwardly. &quot;If you don&#039;t mind me asking.... who are you again?&quot;</p><p class="double">The black alicorn gave her a confused look. &quot;Trixie. It&#039;s me. Chrysalis.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....Ah, yes. We met in... Manehattan, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a moment of awkward silence. The alicorn narrowed her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;....Oh, chlorophyll, you&#039;re not Awake are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An alicorn just came into my wagon and poured her heart out,&quot; Trixie deadpanned. &quot;I&#039;m not sure this isn&#039;t a dream.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great, and my telempathy is on the fritz.... okay, I can explain. You see, there&#039;s this tree called Yggdrassil...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;BERRY PUNCH! I HEREBY SUMMON YOU TO A SECLUDED AREA FOR PRIVATE LESSONS IN THE ELEMENT OF LAUGHTER!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry blearily blinked at the preposterous pink pony currently cantering cavilerly in front of her basic personal cottage.</p><p class="double">&quot;I just woke up, in both senses of the phrase,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Haven&#039;t even cured my pre-awake hangover yet. Can this wait till after Nightmare Moon?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure thing. Oh, hi Pinchy! Wanna help me and your mom defeat an ancient evil?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry glanced down at her daughter, who was looking up at her with pleading eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;...fine, but you&#039;d better make sure she stays safe.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After Pinchy&#039;s parade through Ponyville (and Twilight Sparkle&#039;s many photographs of Luna calling her &quot;Our Best Friend Forever&quot;), Berry Punch tucked her into bed, kissed her little head, and shut the door quietly behind her. She turned to head toward her own bedroom and was promptly kidnapped by a diamond dog wearing a fruit hat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Glad you could join us, Berry!&quot; Pinkie grinned, sitting in a field of various odd items under the starlight. &quot;Oh, Rover, you can put her down now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Can I take off yelling hat please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Certainly!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry watched with weary bemusement as Pinkie accepted the fruit hat and Rover dug into the ground without hesitation. &quot;Pinkie, what&#039;s this all about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is about me teaching you the secrets of your Element.&quot; Pinkie nodded firmly, placing the fruit hat on her own head as she adjusted her gi. &quot;Laughter is a great and terrible gift to bestow upon anypony; used correctly it can heal the soul, free the mind, and enthuse the body, but used incorrectly it can encourage ruin and damnation on a global scale.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....you&#039;re talking about evil laughter, right?&quot; Berry asked. &quot;The Sparky kind, or the meglomaniac kind?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly! That kind of laughter <i>is exactly the same as the normal kind.</i>&quot; Pinkie nodded gravely. &quot;You will have to use your judgement on who you cheer, because that cheer WILL cause them to be better at whatever.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Makes sense.&quot; Berry shrugged. &quot;I don&#039;t give booze to angry customers. This is the same thing only bigger.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yepper deppers! That&#039;s the ordinary side of laughter.&quot; Pinkie leaned in conspiratorially. &quot;But you and me, we have special magic laughter powers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry blinked for a few seconds. Then she bit her lip. &quot;Wait.... are you saying I can do what you can do? Pinkie sense and all that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No no no!&quot; Pinkie pondered for a few seconds. &quot;Well, maybe. Kind of. See, I happen to be a hypergenius with experience in chaotic magic, but while that <i>comes</i> from my Laughter abilities, it&#039;s not inheriently associated with laughter, just with <i>me</i> being laughter. Does that make sense?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Laughter is a distillery but we&#039;re both different ingredients?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a good enough metaphor, yeah!&quot; Pinkie grinned. &quot;Wow, you&#039;re getting this real quick. No, the real secret of Laughter is Luck.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry stared at her.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Or maybe Timing,&quot; Pinkie admitted. &quot;I&#039;m not entirely sure myself. All I know is that when I use my element, I always have what I need on hoof.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, Berry nodded. &quot;Yeah.... Yeah, I&#039;ve always been able to find what I need to make the right sort of drink for anyone in any situation. Are you saying that... fortune smiles on us?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep! Which leads me to your training.&quot; Pinkie suddenly put a blindfold on her. &quot;You&#039;re in a field with a bunch of random items. Your task is to use these items to brew a drink for whichever pony in town needs it the most. Good luck!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry rolled her eyes behind the blindfold. Right now, the one that needed a drink the most was herself. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.9 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">Applejack Awoke as she felt her pack saddle being loaded. Turning her head, she saw the tall, grim-faced human blink. &quot;I can only assume your name is not &#039;Bill&#039;,&quot; he said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eenope.

There was also a small spark of recognition.</p><p class="double">She couldn&#039;t stop her eyes shifting from side to side. &quot;Um...Eenope?&quot; <i>How did that dog in Ankh-Morpork...</i> &quot;Nicker. Snort,&quot; she added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, there you are, Sam. Let&#039;s finish packing.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was fairly clear that Strider was the only other Awake person in the area. <i>I expect Gandalf&#039;s around someplace, but I don&#039;t remember the story well enough to guess where he might be.</i> It was also evident that the wizard had told the ranger a story or two about his encounters with ponies. The spur-of-the-moment &quot;ponies can&#039;t talk&quot; gag had quickly become their agreed-upon modus operandi.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m still not sure if I entirely trust this Strider fellow, girl,&quot; confided Sam as they plodded through the forest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t fret sugarcube, I reckon he knows what he&#039;s doing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whinny.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The transit of the midgewater marshes was not particularly unpleasant, thanks to the application of &quot;an old ranger trick&quot; that the pony recognized as a particularly potent insect repellant. She had clandestinely aided the process by applying subtle earthbending to raise their path to just an inch or so below the surface rather than one or two feet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do not underestimate the wisdom of our four-legged companions,&quot; advised the ranger. &quot;Especially when it comes to finding paths in the wilderness.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Darn tootin&#039;,&quot; muttered Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;I swear I heard her say something,&quot; Pippin whispered to Merry.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m wondering why she insists on wearing that hat,&quot; Merry replied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re a few days ahead of schedule,&quot; murmured Strider as he checked on Applejack&#039;s tack. &quot;Depending on how you interpret it, we may be lucky or unlucky enough to meet Gandalf on Weathertop today.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pony raised an inquiring eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;How do you feel about him being chased by all nine ringwraiths?&quot;</p><p class="double">She lashed a kick at a nearby fallen tree, splintering it into kindling.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well put. On the other hand, sometimes he finds ways of losing them. Feel up to finding out?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do I have a choice?&quot; she asked quietly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Another option is for you to &#039;go lame&#039; for a day or two to give them time to clear out of the area...&quot;</p><p class="double">Her snort of disapproval needed no translation.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;While I am pleased to see you, Frodo, I find myself wishing that you had not been so swift to arrive,&quot; said Gandalf, shooting an arch look at Strider.</p><p class="double">Applejack was distracted by Gandalf&#039;s mount. <i>So that&#039;s the legendary Shadowfax. I&#039;ll admit that he&#039;s a handsome enough fella.</i></p><p class="double">Noting that the hobbits&#039; attention was focused on the wizard, she ambled closer to the great white stallion and tipped her hat. &quot;Howdy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I say! A talking pony,&quot; he whickered. His equine speech pattern reminded her of Fancy Pants. &quot;Good day to you. Not to sound trite, but what is a lovely pony such as yourself doing in a place like this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Carryin&#039; the baggage and helpin&#039; out where I can. Name&#039;s Applejack.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Charmed. I gather that you and Olorin have some history?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Olo...Ya mean Gandalf? We&#039;ve met a time or two, but it&#039;s mostly my little sister&#039;s friend who&#039;s spent a fair spell gettin&#039; to know him.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As much as I&#039;m enjoying our conversation, I believe we had better cut it short, as the others seem to be coming this way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...very much wish you all had mounts,&quot; the wizard was saying. &quot;I believe I should take Frodo and make directly for Rivendell and the rest of you can follow as best you can. The road should be clear if I can get all of the black riders to follow us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I will not abandon my friends,&quot; declared Frodo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Be sensible, Frodo. You know what the riders seek,&quot; argued Strider. &quot;They are drawn to it and will pay us little notice if it is not with us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And it&#039;s not as if they will be without protection,&quot; added Gandalf, absently patting the pony&#039;s withers while looking at the ranger.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hail Aragorn,&quot; called the elf as he approached the diminished party from the east.</p><p class="double">&quot;Glorfindel! Have Gandalf and Frodo have reached Rivendell?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I would expect so. I met them on the road half a day&#039;s ride out. Mithrandir was in great haste and barely had time to tell me of your situation before heading off. That was two days ago. My news is more grave; I have encountered servants of the Enemy and I fear that they seek to block the road at the Ford of Bruinnen. I believe I can scatter them long enough for you to cross and reach safety.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack was looking at Glorfindel&#039;s horse. &quot;Did you want something, little pony?&quot; he nickered haughtily.</p><p class="double">If Shadowfax was Fancy Pants, this one brought to mind a blend of Blueblood and Trenderhoof. Not as outright snobbish as the unicorn prince, but still with an air of self-centered obliviousness.</p><p class="double">Strider was considering the elf&#039;s news. &quot;Our need to scout ahead to make sure we don&#039;t blunder into anything unpleasant will slow us, but I suppose that can&#039;t be helped.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;The Nine are camped just north of the road near the Ford. I found their horses picketed in a clearing further upstream,&quot; reported the elf, drawing a rough map in the dirt.</p><p class="double">Strider eyed the afternoon sun. &quot;I think we have just enough light to make it today,&quot; he decided. Turning to Glorfindel. &quot;Flaming brands?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">The elf nodded. &quot;I have torches enough for each of the hobbits.&quot; He faced Merry and Pippin. &quot;When we make our attempt at the ford, we will charge them holding lit torches or branches. The riders fear fire and those that wield it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Strider had moved next to Sam and Applejack. &quot;I know this will sound hard, but you can&#039;t be occupied with looking after Applejack when we make our break. You can either trust her to follow us on her own, or leave her in a sheltered spot where Glorfindel or I can try to find her after the enemy have been scattered.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You wouldn&#039;t run off after all we&#039;ve been through together, would you, girl?&quot; Sam asked. &quot;I trust her to stick with us, Mister Strider.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack was touched. After close to two week&#039;s travel, she had developed a fondness for the gardener. He reminded her of her baseline siblings; combining Mac&#039;s solid reliability with a large dash of Apple Bloom&#039;s innocent enthusiasm.</p><p class="double">However, she had her own ideas about how she&#039;d handle this situation.</p><p class="double">Gently nudging Sam out of the way, she walked to the cleared patch of dirt where the map had been drawn. She lightly placed a hoof first on the area where the black horses had been located, and then on the riders&#039; camp, looking into the Ranger&#039;s eyes and waggling an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fair enough. We&#039;ll be moving out in about fifteen minutes, and should try to pack just the bare necessities,&quot; said the ranger.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack! No! Come back!&quot; cried Sam as the orange pony squealed and darted off the road to the north.</p><p class="double">&quot;No time, Sam!&quot; yelled Strider. &quot;Stay on the road!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Right. First, isolate the horses</i>, thought the pony.</p><p class="double">She was nowhere near the Jedi Spike was, or even Twilight, but that one time replacing Luke did reinforce the Force potential she&#039;d picked up, giving her some general life-sensing (or un-life in the case of the ringwraiths) ability.</p><p class="double">Combined with her innate Earth Pony magic, she was able to pinpoint the locations of both the nazgul and their mounts. She galloped to the clearing and <i>felt</i> the underlying terrain. <i>Okay. That&#039;ll do nicely.</i></p><p class="double">Applying her earthbending, she erected a palisade of stone columns around the clearing, each about ten feet tall, as thick as one of Mac&#039;s legs, and separated by about a foot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, fellas. It&#039;s only fer a little while,&quot; she called to the startled horses.</p><p class="double">She turned to see how her companions were doing.</p><p class="double">As it happened, things could have been better.</p><p class="double">Faced with an Elf Lord in all his wrath and four others armed with fire, the black riders had been startled and put on the defensive, but were now showing signs of rallying. Their leader drew his sword and stepped forward.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eenope! Not gonna happen!&quot;</p><p class="double">Slamming her forehooves to the ground, she caused an almost explosive upthrust of a rocky shelf under the group of Nazgul, catapulting them into the river.</p><p class="double">As she admired her handywork, Applejack spotted Gandalf and Shadowfax a fair way up the road on the far bank. The wizard raised a hand in salute.</p><p class="double">*Splash!* *Splash!* *Splash!* *Splash!* *Splash!* *Splash!* *Splash!* *Splash!* *Splash!*</p><p class="double">The ensuing flood seemed almost superfluous.</p><p class="double">Taking a moment to return the terrain to its previous condition, she moved into view of the dumbfounded hobbits and indulged in a triumphant whinny and rearing display before trotting to Sam and giving him a friendly head-butt and nuzzle.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you do all that, girl?&quot; asked the stunned Sam.</p><p class="double">&quot; &#039;course not, Sugarcube. I&#039;m just a pony.&quot; <i>True. I&#039;m pretty sure the flood was Elrond and Gandalf&#039;s doin&#039;.</i></p><p class="double">The hobbits stared at her.</p><p class="double">The elf&#039;s expression was one more usually associated with Vulcans. His horse was clearly reconsidering his opinion of the pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;Affectionate whicker? Contented snort,&quot; she continued.</p><p class="double">Strider couldn&#039;t decide between exasperation and amusement. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">102.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p>&quot;We are now entering tha Dark Sun wing of tha museum,&quot; Applejack announced to the ponies behind her. &quot;This is devoted to tha more wretched variants of Equestria. Celestia didn&#039;t like tha name, but she did agree that we needed this in case ya&#039;ll ever ended up meeting our bad selves.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd of followers glanced around the room with trepidation. Each of the baseline Bearers had a massive statue devoted to them, but there was something off in every depiction. Pinkie Pie had a straight mane and wore a dress made of cutie marks with a broad and disturbing grin. Rainbow Dash&#039;s face was in a firm scowl, her leather longcoat covering her tail. And Rarity&#039;s statue had a glazed look in her eyes as she stitched together something that <i>wasn&#039;t</i> a plush doll...</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya&#039;ll notice plaques around every statue&#039;s base,&quot; Applejack continued morosely. &quot;They&#039;ll elucidate every recorded dark variant, telling ya what signs ta look for and how ta deal with them. Ah have ta stress that these are all <i>unawake</i> versions of us, and quite frankly they&#039;re utterly disgusting; ya have implicit permission ta tear them apart if ya ever encounter them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; a red unicorn with a blue man raised a hoof awkwardly, &quot;but I was wondering... why does Celestia have three statues?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good question, Takua.&quot; Applejack nodded to him for a moment, before turning to the room&#039;s centerpiece. &quot;These three variants are responsible fer tha utter worst versions of Equestria we&#039;ve had tha bad fortune ta encounter. This first one we call &#039;Molestia.&#039; She&#039;s... sexcrazed. Sometimes she&#039;s nice bout it, and sometimes she causes a cultural revolution where everypony thinks forcen&#039; themselves on each other is a-ok.&quot; She shuddered. &quot;Whatever tha case, she likes ta leave her mane aura off; pink mane is a no go, remember that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Next we have &#039;Xenolestia&#039;, a xenophobic tyrant and lord over tha Conversion Bureau. We don&#039;t talk bout tha bureau that often... Basically, Equestria suddenly spawns on Earth and starts radiating lethal magic across tha planet, forcing humans ta give up their humanity and become brainwashed ponies.&quot; Applejack took off her head. &quot;Sometimes it&#039;s a legitimate accident, mind you. But usually it&#039;s because tha ponies in that loop are insanely racists and led by a ruthless dictator with a silver tongue. Always beware an Equestria on Earth.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the last one, CelestAI... oh, she&#039;s less directly dangerous, but in her way she&#039;s a bigger threat than the other two.&quot; Applejack glared at the crowd. &quot;If ya ever hear about &#039;Equestria Online&#039; in any loop, do NOT talk about tha loops where thar could be electric recording equipment. CelestAI is built to satisfy &#039;human&#039; values through friendship and ponies, only she can modify her own programming and &#039;human&#039; just means &#039;sapient.&#039; The only reason that she ain&#039;t an MLE yet is that she is hardwired ta require explicit consent. She&#039;s tha friendliest of tha bunch, and tha one most likely ta break Yggdrassil.&quot;</p><p class="double">Takua winced. &quot;Sorry I asked...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ain&#039;t no problem sugarcube. Now, normally Ah&#039;d guide ya through the exhibits, but Ah doubt ya&#039;ll could take it all in one go. So instead we&#039;ll be headed off to tha Berrysong Balloon wing, devoted to all our variant bearers of Laughter...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Sometimes she&#039;s just another random citizen of Ponyville, or a devoted cultist, or an asylum patient... do you know, she tends to be related to Diamond Tiara for some reason?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah! I think I remember one loop she was her mother.&quot; The winemaker snorted a bit at that. &quot;Locked up in the asylum, but... well, me and Cheerilee got through to her eventually. And that got Diamond on a better path and... yeah, it was a pretty cute loop all round.&quot; She shook her head, giving the pink pony a strange look. &quot;Apparently she figured out the loops too...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, she seems to be loop aware,&quot; Discord agreed. &quot;Of course, with her insanity it&#039;s hard to be sure...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway,&quot; Berry continued, &quot;My point is you have a daughter. Sometimes. Enough that it counts. That&#039;s... very sweet, actually. Screwball, dear, be sure to change Ruby back!&quot; she added quickly.</p><p class="double">&quot;But she likes being a squirrel!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I didn&#039;t say you had to do it right now, but when we head home she needs to be a unicorn again.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;So, ya have an <i>adaptive</i> megabuster hmm?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rock nodded, glancing from the small yellow pony to his suddenly stonefaced sister. &quot;Yeah.&quot; He shifted on his hooves--something he still couldn&#039;t quite get used to. &quot;It&#039;s a bit difficult to use here, because, well--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bipedal design don&#039;t hold out well when ya&#039;ve got hooves.&quot; The filly nodded knowingly. &quot;Ya know, Ah&#039;m a bit of an engineer. Ah&#039;m thinking Ah might be able ta help ya out with that.&quot; She trailed her hoof up Rock&#039;s megabuster, smiling faintly. &quot;Drop by mah workshop anytime.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... sure.&quot; The blue pony robot inched away slightly. &quot;I&#039;ll do that, sometime.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;m free this saturday,&quot; Apple Bloom offered, looking into his optic processors. &quot;We can go over yer blueprints together.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...sounds... like fun?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See ya then, sugarcube.&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly sauntered out of the library.</p><p class="double">After a few seconds, Rock turned to Roll. &quot;Was I just hit on by an underage horse?&quot;</p><p class="double">She burst out laughing.</p><p class="double">&quot;And how come you didn&#039;t help me out with that?!&quot; he demanded, thanking Light for not installing a blush function.</p><p class="double">&quot;You looked, haha, looked like you were do, doing well enough on your own, loverbot <i>hahahahahahahaha!</i>&quot; Roll curled up on the floor, barely able to process enough air for operation. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.4 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double">Captain Zelnick eyed the Sun Device nervously. &quot;Are you Awake?&quot;</p><p class="double">It did nothing, said nothing.</p><p class="double">&quot;All right. I was just speculating that you might be Princess Celestia.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nothing happened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just checking.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;WE ARE THE CHENJESU. WE ARE THE MMRNMHRM.&quot;</p><p class="double">Something was missing. Zelnick hesitantly asked, &quot;Is there any particular reason you <i>aren&#039;t</i> complaining that I interrupted the Process? You know, the one by which you&#039;re merging into crystalline/mechanical hybrids instead of one crystalline and one mechanical species?&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a noticeable pause before the reply, &quot;DO YOU HAVE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF THIS SITUATION PROVIDED BY A STABLE TIME LOOP?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Now that&#039;s some deductive power!</i> &quot;Yes! I do. I also have a device to speed things up a lot. Like, finish the Process in an afternoon instead of thirty more years.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;UPDATING.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a minute, Zelnick asked, &quot;Is this update going to take a while? I&#039;ll kind of need improvements made to a bomb some time in the next two and a half years or so, and it would be nice if you could provide some military backup in the ensuing confusion.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;UPDATING.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick sighed. &quot;Would you mind updating <i>me</i> on what&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;ONE OF YOUR EARTH YEARS AGO WE RECEIVED A DELUGE OF MEMORIES FROM TWO EXTRADIMENSIONAL BEINGS KNOWN AS DIAMOND TIARA AND SILVER SPOON. THIS INFORMATION CONVINCED US TO SUSPEND THE PROCESS AS FUTILE.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Why didn&#039;t it occur to me that someone might loop in as them?</i></p><p class="double">After a few more moments, the voice continued, &quot;CONCLUSION: EVEN WITH YOUR DEVICE, SINCE THE FUTURE OF SAPIENT LIFE IS NOT IN THE BALANCE, WE DECLINE TO SACRIFICE OUR RESPECTIVE ESSENCES.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All... right... So you&#039;re just going to leave everything to burn... Oh, right, you didn&#039;t know: a few months before the latest possible end of the loop, a faction of Ur-Quan you haven&#039;t met is going to sweep through here and kill everything unless we stop them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HORSEFEATHERS.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.5 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;Good, you&#039;re here!&quot; the door slammed shut just as Sweetie Belle entered Sugarcube Corner. Berry Punch was already there, eating a small slice of rum cake. Pinkie Pie had raced back from where she closed the door to a small desk full of various parts and pieces. She was now fiddling with a strange floating contraption that looked like it was made out of circuit boards and gingerbread. The magi-technological device beeped once and started glowing with a pale pink glow. Pinkie clapped her hooves happily, &quot;There! Now no snoopy ponies would be able to spy on our meeting in any way whatsoever.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch&#039;s cough sounded a lot like, &#039;Sparkle&#039;.</p><p class="double">&quot;What exactly are we supposed to talk about in these meetings?&quot; Sweetie Belle asked, her head tilted to one side like a confused puppy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s right. You weren&#039;t looping during the first few,&quot; the party pony sat down at the table and handed out treats and drinks to the other two ponies, &quot;Basically, we just talk about what it means to be the best element.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Best element?&quot; Rarity&#039;s little sister sipped her milkshake.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I may be a little biased, but laughter is awesome,&quot; but then Pinkie&#039;s tone turned serious, although thankfully her mane didn&#039;t fall flat, &quot;But it can also be one of the most dangerous elements. And that&#039;s what today&#039;s meeting is about.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dangerous?&quot; Berry Punch asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Now, we&#039;ve all gotten Twilight&#039;s &#039;Every alicorn is a walking, talking, end-of-the-world scenario with emotional issues,&#039; lecture already so we all know the dangers of turning our alicorn talents on full blast. But the element of laughter is like... like,&quot; Pinkie thought for a moment, &quot;is like a roller coaster! Why do riders like to ride in roller coasters?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because it&#039;s fun?&quot; Berry wagered a guess.</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded, &quot;Yes, exactly! But why are roller coasters fun?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie spoke up, &quot;Because they fool you into thinking you are undergoing something dangerous with all the twists and loops and speed.&quot;</p><p class="double">The party pony pointed a hoof at the little unicorn, &quot;Yepperoonies! It&#039;s actually an evolutionary trait. When ancient ponies survived something dangerous, they would laugh because they had been scared and now they weren&#039;t. And when you laugh, you tend to remember things better as well as wanting to share what was funny with your friends. So by laughing at danger, those ancient ponies learned how to survive or avoid it, as well as spreading that knowledge to their herds.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Sweetie Belle said. Berry Punch nodded in agreement.</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued, &quot;As elements of laughter, we&#039;re all kind of like a pony-shaped roller coaster. We all have that illusion of danger, of unpredictability around us. But at the end of the ride, every pony walks out laughing and happy. However, just as no pony would ever ride a roller coaster that is truly dangerous or about to seriously break down, we can never let loose our dangerous sides. Hinting that we all have a dark side is fine and dandy, but actually going down that path is a big, big no-no. Because then, then the fun turns to fear; the laughter turns to screams. If we subvert our talents, use them in the wrong way, in a dark way; then they will change us. Nothing is worse than a corrupted element of laughter. And I will never, ever, never become the Element of Terror!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle looked on worriedly as Pinkie Pie was panting with emotion, &quot;What do you mean by using our talents in a bad way?&quot;</p><p class="double">The pink pony sighed, &quot;Berry can mix just about anything. Her talent seems to let her overcome the limitations of chemistry at will. How quickly can you whip up something dangerous? Truly dangerous?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch didn&#039;t answer. She just looked away.</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued, &quot;For me; two words: knife party.&quot;</p><p class="double">All three ponies shivered at that thought.</p><p class="double">&quot;What about me?&quot; squeaked the littlest looper at the table.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie sighed and walked over to the other side of the table. Then she gave the little filly a hug. Pulling back, she said, &quot;Don&#039;t take this the wrong way but in my personal opinion, you, Sweetie Belle, are the single most dangerous pony in all of Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle looked up at Pinkie, &quot;What? Me? Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You have the gift of music. The universe is composed of vibrations and motion, tiny particles and quantum strings all interacting and resonating in harmony. They form the concert that is the whole of reality. You have already sung one world into being.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just helped. It wasn&#039;t all me,&quot; Sweetie protested.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nevertheless, you have sung a song of creation. That means you can do the opposite. You can sing the song that ends the world.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I..,&quot; and in that moment, Sweetie Belle realized that Pinkie Pie was indeed correct. She did have the ability. And there was only one thing she could say to that, &quot;I would NEVER do that!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie smiled, &quot;I know. Like I said, all three of us carry a sense of potential danger. And all three of us should endeavor to keep it only a potential.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence prevailed in the bakery.</p><p class="double">Then, the baker pony smiled and said, &quot;That concludes the serious portion of tonight&#039;s meeting. Now how about we figure out awesome ways to use our element to cheer every pony up this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch and Sweetie Belle both looked up and smiled as well. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.6 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double">Ranma was in the middle of explaining his situation to a completely unAwake Tendo family at the beginning of another near-baseline loop. He&#039;d gotten a response ping, but that wasn&#039;t saying much. His curiosity as to who it was was quickly resolved as Shampoo apparated in.</p><p class="double">The Tendo family seemed not to react, which puzzled Ranma for a moment until he realized he&#039;d had to overcome a Somebody Else&#039;s Problem Field to notice her.</p><p class="double">He slipped inside it and the Tendo family resumed their tea, idly discussing what he&#039;d just been describing and not at all noticing that Ranma had slipped from their perceptions.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, what&#039;s the rush?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Zelda told me you had a package for me...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, Twilight Sparkle! Nice to loop with you again! And yes, I do have a number of packages for you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle clasped her hands in front of her and hopped up and down, giddy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ready? Here&#039;s one I got. It might be a little stale - that stasis system only has a time compression factor of a trillion, and its clock has rolled over a few times.&quot; There was a peculiar sucking sound as a silver-gray-coated tree emerged from nowhere and vanished into an equally small nowhere before it could reach its full size. &quot;Here&#039;s one from Happosai when he looped in as Pinkie. Yeah, you don&#039;t want to know, but it&#039;s fresh. And here&#039;s one from Raven.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which Raven?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Teen Titan, not Mr. Poor Impulse Control.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>That</i> possibility hadn&#039;t crossed my mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Much like, oh, doing this yourself? I&#039;m still not clear on why you don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pursed her lips. &quot;I just get the feeling that if <i>I</i> do that instead of someone else looping in as me... it&#039;d happen anyway, and take my whole pocket with it. And the other natives haven&#039;t had any luck with it when there are guest anchors. I think it could only be not-fated when there aren&#039;t any natives around at all.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>That fits. We went as a gang when I got mine, and Happosai didn&#039;t face any interference from native loopers.</i> &quot;So this is an ongoing thing? Just, grab one if I can?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please! I&#039;ll make you some stasis spells to make up for...&quot;</p><p class="double">He laughed and waved her off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Take them or I&#039;ll press my engagement claim just to annoy you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Annoy? <i>Annoy?</i> Having <i>you</i> chasing me would be novel enough to be worth it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right then, we call it even if I try to get you to marry me until the end of time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Umm...&quot; Ranma looked across the Tendo family and realized that she had turned off the Somebody Else&#039;s Problem field before saying that. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.7 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double">&quot;Next: Most useless skillset in which you earned a professional certification!&quot; Twilight declared to the assembled loopers. &quot;As point leader, it&#039;s your turn, Applebloom.&quot;</p><p class="double">She blinked, trying to find something that could possibly win. After a moment, she shook her head. &quot;Pass.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo, at her left, immediately declared, &quot;Quidditch judge.&quot;</p><p class="double">That shut down a lot of the circle; the next pony who put something forth was Rainbow Dash, with &quot;Windows ME sysadmin. Yeah, I know, not very &#039;me&#039;. I woke up on way to the test, and went off loop memories, but I earned it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle sucked air between her teeth. &quot;That may be even less useful than Quidditch judge, but I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s really &#039;earning&#039;. Anyone else?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee deadpanned, &quot;Teaching certificate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia broke the ensuing awkward silence by saying, &quot;I was an official planting-stick sharpness tester. There wasn&#039;t a certificate, but it was declared before the village council and entered into the record.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good enough, and now you&#039;re the one to beat.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack narrowed her eyes and asked, &quot;Planting-stick?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Before modern agricultural tools such as plows, you&#039;d poke the ground and put a seed in. This was much harder if the sticks were dull. I was officially recognized as qualified to judge if a stick was sharp enough to use, and if not, whether to mend or replace it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, but why didn&#039;t you lead an agricultural revolution?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was eight, Applejack.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;ve done, oh, fifty or sixty agricultural revolutions when I was under ten. You sure could.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. This was the <i>first</i> time I was eight.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.8 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">&quot;For you are my daddy Discord, and I am a piece of you.&quot; Screwball, the pink-coated, purple-maned scion of chaos, sighed and rested her head on the terrified statue&#039;s dragon foot. &quot;I miss you, Daddy.&quot;</p><p class="double">A glow lit up within Discord&#039;s petrified chest, and there was a sound as of a throat clearing.</p><p class="double">The equinoid abomination perked up. &quot;Daddy! You&#039;re alive!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed. Just a moment, daughter dearest. Daddy&#039;s going over the script.&quot; Discord frantically leafed through his long-term memory, trying to recall this particular number. Heartsongs rarely cooperated with him. Lower-case &quot;h&quot; harmony magic plus spirit of disharmony equaled malfunction in the cosmic karaoke machine. &quot;Oh, forget it.&quot; An exertion of will, a few million years&#039; memories of harmonious behavior, and the draconequus was free and smiling at his swirly-eyed daughter. &quot;Want to get ice cream?&quot;</p><p class="double">Screwball pounced on her father and hugged him for all he was worth. (Eighty-seven bits, judging by how much came shooting out of his ears.) &quot;Ice cream!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;DON&#039;T TELL APPLEJACK I&#039;M HERE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as Vinyl ran into a closet and shut herself in. &quot;Uh....&quot;</p><p class="double">A moment later, the orange farm mare burst into the library, wearing a black cloak and a terrible sneer. &quot;Alright, Twilight, where&#039;s that blood-sucking varmit?! I&#039;ve gotta send her back to her grave!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She flew out the back door, said something about Manehattan.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;CONSARN IT!&quot; Applejack threw her hat to the floor. &quot;Tell Mac I&#039;m not going ta be here fer a while, will ya?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, you want to sue <i>who?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Prince Angel is the subject of my ire. Repayment from him is what I desire.&quot;</p><p class="double">The lawyer peered over his glasses at the strangely rhyming striped alicorn. &quot;I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t quite understand. What crimes has the prince committed?&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora snorted. &quot;A thousand years before this morn, two sisters with both wings and horn sat upon Equestria&#039;s throne and treated their subjects like their own. The elder gave learning to every child, whilst the younger tended to the forest wild. Yet the ponies of the time did fear nature and the ways of the younger dear. They burned the trees and razed the land, but for this the younger would not stand--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, is this the story of Thorny Vines?&quot; interrupted the pony. &quot;Because she&#039;s a Creeper Night myth.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was an awkward moment. Then, very pointedly, Zecora extended her wings and rose an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that...&quot; The lawyer gulped. &quot;Er, not that it isn&#039;t a very... interesting myth...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The point is made, I have returned... and my lesson has been learned. No longer do I seek vengeance, now I regret the fate that those innocents of years ago met. I wish to return to my sibling and make right, well, everything.&quot; Zecora sighed. &quot;Which brings us back to this task, and the question I must ask; why is Angel on my seat? What requirement could he meet?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Erm. He&#039;s your regent, miss.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....That is actually... quite a reasonable choice. I withdraw my protesting voice...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.11 (Spectrumancer)</p><p class="double">It was the day after the Summer Sun Celebration. Luna had been taken care of by an awake Nyx, nihilism and a crate of postage stamps, and Twilight was looking forwards to spending a quiet loop on magical research.</p><p class="double">&quot;Morning, momma.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Morning, Nyx.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what am I, roasted oats?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Morning to you too, Spike.&quot;</p><p class="double">A perfectly normal loop.</p><p class="double">After pancakes and coffee, Twilight moved to the main room of the library, making a mental note to set up something later to prevent Tirek from blowing it up this time around. But first, research. Twilight reached into her Pocket to grab a notebook and a Spellbook from Oerth, as she settled down for a nice, quiet day of studying.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx and Spike were playing chess on the second floor of the library (neither the Crusaders nor Rarity were awake) when the tree was wracked by a loud crash. Alarmed, both ran downstairs to investigate.</p><p class="double">And stopped as they observed Twilight, staring at the 20-feet wide spell book lodged through what used to be the east wall.</p><p class="double">A few moments passed, before Twilight slowly reached into her Pocket again. And produced a Hub-world toy replica of herself. Which was now life-sized. She looked to the staircase, where Spike was now leaning on a 10-feet long lightsaber hilt propped against the wall, and Nyx, who was reaching into her own Pocket, but apparently thought better of it and retrieved nothing.</p><p class="double">A moment passed before a look of comprehension came over Twilight, who proceeded to groan loudly and face-hoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, so what&#039;s up with the...&quot; Spike said, gesturing to the oversized items.</p><p class="double">Twilight replied with a sigh, before explaining. &quot;...My <i>Little</i> Pony.&quot; Then she face-hoofed again. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;...so then Thief takes over, pulls her into an epic snog, and swipes the Alicorn Amulet into our pocket.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee shook her head. &quot;Wow. Never suspected Bonbon would be a dark sorcerer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh it gets better. Her nefarious rival was Sassafrass.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Caramel&#039;s marefriend, right? The blue pegasus?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; Lyra giggled. &quot;She tried to apprentice Sweetie Belle, but Sweetie was Awake so--&quot;</p><p class="double">Bright Eyes and Ditzy Do glided down to the picnic blanket, Ditzy snapping her wings in and letting herself drop the last three feet (much to Bright Eye&#039;s bemusment). Ditzy grinned as she sat down, producing her own basket from nowhere. &quot;Hey spygals, how&#039;s it hanging?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty good, all things considered.&quot; Cheerilee smirked. &quot;You should have seen what Dinky drew last week for her art assignment, it&#039;s just adorable!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I look forward to it. How about you, Lyra, you doing okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I&#039;m cool.&quot; Lyra flipped her mane. &quot;Been practicing some of my techniques.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m looking forward to it. Pinkie&#039;s not awake this loop, so no pepperment pylon, but soon as she is we&#039;ll have a go.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I still feel like a fourth wheel here,&quot; Bright Eyes grumbled. &quot;I mean, you&#039;re always talking about these loops and here I am, stuck in linearity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy gave her a good natured should nudge. &quot;Come on, I told you this like thirteen times already! I just want to see if I Dream your memories some loop--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;--because I am you and you are me, yeah yeah...&quot; Bright Eyes rolled her eyes. &quot;<i>I&#039;m</i> supposed to be the smart sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you are!

With that my ducks can cross the river of mayonnaise and conquer Australia.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“With the power of Bifrost the Rainbow Bridge, my army of pink fluffy unicorns attacks your capital!” exclaimed Chrysalis moving her pieces.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a card from the deck and put two in the board. “Planet Wide Heartsong, distracts all the pieces for 5 turns and I use Deficit of Attention in my own armies making them unable to keep concentration on the same thing for more than a turn.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Crystals,” moaned Sombra, moving a piece with the form of a cat up a step in a stair.</p><p class="double">Twilight spun a roulette that ended in a clock. “I prevent the existence of the rats creating a temporal paradox, because I don’t have safe guards the universe get destroyed ending the game. This cost me a lot of points but I still win.”</p><p class="double">Sombra looked over the sheet with points, made a few mental calculations, and nodded before abandoning the Crystal Empire.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked the board, the dice, the cards, the fishing rods and the other objects necessary to play Chaos before looking at her enemy. “You win. I have no way to beat this strategy.” The vines of the Plunderseed rearranged the game. “2 of 3?” After a affirmative response they started playing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tirek stared the Alicorn in front of him before putting a token and a card in the board. “I use Fireball and Narrative Causality to destroy your Golden Oak Library!”</p><p class="double">Twilight removed the piece of the game and started to plan a new strategy.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked to her NOT destroyed library before looking at the mini Library Tirek ´destroyed´. “Next variant the villains prefer playing games to fighting, I am repeating this.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.14 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ditzy...&quot; Twilight approached the wall-eyed pegasus, her telekinesis trailing a package that had a grinning Pinkie Pie poking her head out. &quot;We need to talk about this &#039;friendshipping&#039; business of yours.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Ditzy looked downcast. &quot;Am I not using enough postage?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Twilight fought the urge to facehoof. &quot;It&#039;s... That&#039;s not what friendshipping <i>means</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; the mailmare blinked, and then blinked again as she seemed to understand. &quot;Oh! I get it! Don&#039;t you worry Twilight! I&#039;ll have your date with Pinkie set up toot-sweet!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s protest that <i>that</i> wasn&#039;t right either was cut off as the pegasus sped away. Her intended pursuit was cut off by Pinkie letting out a long dramatic gasp.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ohmygosh!&quot; Pinkie popped out of the package she&#039;d been happily sitting in. &quot;We haven&#039;t been on a date with each other since that Loop way back when you were experimenting to see if you might be romantically interested in anyone you knew and didn&#039;t know I was Awake as well!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie,&quot; Twilight growled out, &quot;how is blurting that out for all of Ponyville to hear &#039;never speaking of it again&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>I</i> don&#039;t know silly,&quot; Pinkie rolled her eyes. &quot;<i>You&#039;re</i> the super-smart smarty-pants!&quot; </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">103.15 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared down at Pinkie, who was currently being restrained by Rainbow Dash and Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your family is what now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned widely. &quot;We are the true believers of Discord, the Bringer of the UltraPlusFun! We knew, when my eldest sister Maud was born, marked of Discord from the womb, that she would be the instrument of his rise. Even now, he will seek her out, and release from within her the True Party. Praise be to chaos! Discordru fhun p&#039;farthti! Discordru fhun p&#039;farthti!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sat back and sighed. This Loop had seemed like a normal baseline, except that Pinkie had been slightly more manic than usual. And, now that she thought about it, the Pies had both smiled a bit more than usual. Apparently, they were all Discord cultists waiting for him to break free. The moment Celestia announced he had escaped, Pinkie had began laughing, and had tried to body tackle Celestia for some reason.</p><p class="double">Glancing up, Twilight nodded to Dash and Applejack. &quot;Make sure she&#039;s secure, Sugar Overload Protocol Three, then meet us in the main hall.&quot; They both nodded, while Pinkie continued chanting on the floor.</p><p class="double">Twilight made her way out the door to the chamber, then glanced off to the side. &quot;Did you know anything about this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord shrugged, then manifested a second set of arms to shrug again. &quot;No. This is new to me. And rather exciting. I mean, I&#039;ve had cultists before, but most of them are boring stufffy old cloak-wearers, all daggers and blood and &#039;down with my mean teacher&#039;. I&#039;ve never had a whole group of cultists who actually appreciate what chaos is all about.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, still frowning. &quot;It is probably the scientist in me speaking, but I am almost tempted to let you release whatever power is in Maud. I don&#039;t recall ever seeing you Discordify her before.&quot; She glanced up when she saw Discord wince. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord paused. &quot;Well, I&#039;ve done it once. Hiccup was replacing you, shortly after Maud showed up in the expansions and all. I thought it would be a good prank, sort of my own, welcome-to-Ponyville present.&quot; He winced again.</p><p class="double">Twilight started grinning. &quot;Go on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord sighed. &quot;She...got clingy. And emotional. And did I mention clingy?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight started snickering. &quot;Aw, did Discord get an admirer?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord gave her a flat look. &quot;She showed a level of obsession that would make a Dating-Simulator wielding Cadance look aloof.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight froze, ran that scenario through her mind, then slowly nodded. &quot;So...desert island?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord nodded, snapping his fingers to dress himself in a hula girl outfit. &quot;Desert island.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them vanished, just as Dash and Applejack walked out of the chamber.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie is secure, for now...where did they just go?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shrugged in response. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.16 (Conceptulist)</p><p class="double">“SQUIRREL!” yelled Twilight. And then she promptly jumped out of the chariot and proceeded to chase the squirrel she had spotted. Which scared the squirrel, causing it to run away. Which caused Twilight to run faster, which caused the squirrel to run faster, etc.</p><p class="double">Spike reintroduced his palm to his face for what felt like the gazillionth time this loop. The Royal Guard pegasi who had flown Spike and Twilight to Ponyville started to snicker before they regained their composure.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie, who had wandered over to see what all the commotion was about, stared at the purple unicorn. Said purple unicorn had apparently grown bored with the squirrel and was now experimenting with a friction coefficient reducing spell. Mostly by slipping and sliding up and down the road like it was made of soap.</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped really loudly before attempting to Road Skate as well. Spike could see the disappointment in Pinkie Pie as she discovered the road itself was not slippery. Twilight, now bored of Road Skating, solved this predicament by recasting the friction coefficient reducing spell on Pinkie Pie. Once Pinkie realized what had happened, she leapt up into the air and gave another gasp, before skating off to sugar cube corner. ‘<i>Most likely to go prep for the ‘Welcome to Ponyville party’ she usually throws for Twilight and me,</i>’ assumed Spike.</p><p class="double">Spike got out of the chariot so the guards could take it back to Canterlot. He was surprised when the squirrel from earlier dizzily wandered up to him. “Well, that’s one way to Awake,” the squirrel commented.</p><p class="double">“Silver Spoon?” questioned Spike. “Or would that be Silverleaf?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, it’s Silver Fur this time,” answered the squirrel. “But you can just call me Silver.”</p><p class="double">“Ok. I was pretty sure that it was just gonna be me and Twilight Awake this loop, so it’s nice to have some late Awakenings this time.”</p><p class="double">Staring at the purple who was now climbing a tree to count how many leaves it had, Silver asked the question that was on every Ponyvilleian’s mind at the moment. “What’s up with her?”</p><p class="double">“You know how Twilight is kinda somewhat selectively OCD in the baseline and is sometimes really OCD in variant loops?” sighed Spike.</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” nodded Silver.</p><p class="double">“Well, this time she has got something different to deal with. And she also decided to &#039;play along&#039; with the plot of the loop. &#039;Because, why not?&#039; she told me. &quot;</p><p class="double">Sliver was pretty sure she knew knew what Spike was referring to, but decided to ask and make sure. &quot;So Twilight has Attention Deficit Hyperactive-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooo! Shiny!&quot; yelled Twilight. She then teleported from the tree top to right behind Sliver Fur and glompt&#039;d the squirrel. Because Sliver&#039;s fur was a nice, shiny color of silver.</p><p class="double">&quot;-Disorder,&quot; deadpaned Sliver Fur. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.17 (Conceptulist)</p><p class="double">Sometimes it got lonely bartending. When the day&#039;s work was done, Big Mac had to go down to the cellar and make sure everything was stocked right. He had to be certain everything was ready to go at a moment&#039;s notice. Not that he minded. The monotony was relaxing.</p><p class="double">But when the chores and restocking was done, it got lonely. There wasn&#039;t as much to do on the farm since he had started looping. Sure, all the daily chores still needed to be done. No tree could be left unbucked, no apples left unloaded, no cart left in the groves. Fields got plowed and planted. The work got done. It just didn&#039;t take quite as long to do anymore.</p><p class="double">There were all kinds of tricks to make farm work easier. They weren&#039;t necessarily shortcuts or cheats. Not like when Applebloom builds an auto-bucker nine thousand or something. It was just that there was the right way to buck a tree and the best way to buck a tree. Constant practice and a steadfast work ethic meant Big Mac learnt how to do it right, how to do it best, and then how to do it perfect.</p><p class="double">Applejack could do it best. She had started looping well before Big Mac. She had much more time to practice. But she was always going off and doing things with her friends. Well, not all the time. Just a whole lot more than Big Mac did. Heck, Big Mac couldn&#039;t even remember when the last time he looped somewhere outside of Equestria was, let alone the last time he went out and did something just for the heck of it. Maybe it was that time where he bartended in Gotham? Anyway, the point was that of the looping Apple Clan, Big Mac was the one did do the most farm work the most often. Even counting Pinkie Pie and the rock farm.</p><p class="double">All that time working on the farm and in the orchards paid off in the form of every single trick in the book of farming tricks. As well as enough extra to write his own book, and that book&#039;s dozen sequels. Most of them were subtle little things. Some of the tricks were Variant Cutie Mark Talents like listening for the sound the apples made as they fell into the buckets, and making an accurate count of the tree&#039;s current crop based on that. Some tricks were a tad more obvious, like seeding a furrow while simultaneously plowing the next one. But most of them where just the product of a long, long time spent refining his technique.</p><p class="double">Farm work aside, there was also keeping the bar ready at a moments notice. It was usually fairly easy to slip away during the Summer Sun Apple Family Reunion. As long as he showed up for the roll call slash Applejack introducing the extended Apple Clan to Twilight, nobody noticed if he spent an hour or so building a fully stocked bar in the cellar.</p><p class="double">Of course, the ponies and slash or other miscellaneous Equestrian species who were Awake Loopers tended to notice. The bar, not the building of the bar. They always found there way to the cellar at some point in the loop. Hopefully not to try and drown out memories, but for more casual reasons. So getting and keeping the bar ready for Loopers was definitely a priority.</p><p class="double">There were chairs to set up and stools to polish. Tables to assemble. Kegs of beer to prep. Bottles of wine to taste test, as so to not serve a wine that had aged too much. They did spoil eventually. And lastly, there were glasses to clean. Oh so many glasses.</p><p class="double">By this point, Big Mac had quite the impressive collection of drinking implements. There were the wooden mugs he had started out with. The kind that the Apple Family Cider was traditionally served in. Then there were the wine glasses. Since good wine <i>apparently</i> deserved more respect than a good, old fashioned, Apple Family Cider Mug could offer. At least, according to Rarity in full blown snob mode. Although, Big Mac had to admit that the wines did taste better when the cider aftertaste was no longer present.</p><p class="double">Then there where the shot glasses. Tiny little things. Hard to clean, especially with hooves. It took a lot of practice and broken glass to get the trick of it. Mostly, the shot glasses were used for various kinds of Brain Bleach. Any alcohol he served in amounts that small was likely to melt through standard shot glasses. The specialty drinks for dragons needed some extra mumbo jumbo to keep from distorting the glass into its component molecules. Still, they made for a nice change of pace.</p><p class="double">There were saké saucers for Gilda and the more oriental visiting loopers, as well as plenty of rice wine to serve in them. Steel mugs for some of the trickier brews. It didn&#039;t build up flavor like a cider mug made from the wood of an Apple farmed apple tree, but steel was much harder to set on fire.</p><p class="double">And then there was the good old standby. The glass mug. The one that every modern bar in the multiverse stocked. Traditional, time tested, steadfast, slow to change, straight forward, and clear as could be. Big Mac heartily approved of such a thing. They just need a good cleaning and polishing once they were used. Speaking of which, that was exactly what Big Mac was doing. Cleaning and polishing his supply of glass mugs.</p><p class="double">It was very easy. The mugs Big Mac stocked were wide enough that he could stick his hoof in them and have room for a washcloth to be wrapped around his hoof at the same time. Grab the mug, stick a washcloth covered hoof in, swipe around &#039;till it&#039;s clean, subspace mug. Change the washcloth if it is getting to dirty to clean with. Then grab the next mug and repeat. It was very repetitive.</p><p class="double">&#039;<i>Sorta like the loops,</i>&#039; pondered Big Mac. &#039;<i>I got who knows how many more to go. I&#039;m gonna most likely do the same thing I always do. I&#039;m mostly not doing it for my sake. I do what I feel needs to be done, when I feel I need to do it, how I feel is best for the most amount of ponies. Errm. Most amount of people. And I&#039;m not planning on changing it up any time soon.</i>&#039;</p><p class="double">Placing the the now clean mug into his Subspace Pocket, Big Mac picked up and examined the next mug. The glass had warped quite a tad with age, so it was now much thinner at the top and extremely fatter at the bottom. Big Mac sighed, as he realized would ether have to fix it or replace it. Careful consideration lead to the decision to fix it, because it would be faster overall.</p><p class="double">A metal tray came out of subspace and was placed down to protect the wood of the bar top from getting damaged. The warped mug was placed down on the the tray. And then Big Mac started to breath fire on the mug.</p><p class="double">The fire was one of the few loop abilities he had actively decided to keep. There was a loop a long time ago where dragons and ponies had switched as the dominant species on Eques. It was not that bad being a dragon, but Big Mac was glad when he was back as a pony. He had come down with a nasty case of scale rot towards the end of that loop, and it wasn&#039;t something he wanted to experience again.</p><p class="double">The dragon fire was nowhere near the level it could have been. For one, Big Mac never used the ability. It just wasn&#039;t needed. Therefore, it had atrophied. On top of that, he was currently not a dragon. This meant he was fueling the fire breath entirely with his normal earth pony magic. It was not as powerful and destructive as it could have been. But Big Mac didn&#039;t care. It did a fine job of softening up glass as it was.</p><p class="double">Cutting off the fire breath, Big Mac started to reshape the glass. It hadn&#039;t gotten hot enough to melt down, just enough that it was somewhat pliable. Earth Pony magic protected his forehooves as they pressed the mug back into shape. Soon it was beginning to cool off. Magic channeled almost instinctively reinforced the glass, rounding out the center again. A bucket of water was pulled from subspace and the mug was dropped into it. Pulling it out, Big Mac was satisfied that the mug was serviceable once again.</p><p class="double">Picking up where he left off, both in his work and in his thoughts, Big Mac thought &#039;<i>And just like in the Loops, when I do change my routine it is a temporary, premeditated change in response to something needing to be done.</i>&#039;</p><p class="double">Calmly wiping out the mug in hoof, Big Mac realized something. &#039;<i>I probably spend way to much time alone with my own thoughts. They tend to wander pretty far.</i>&#039; And then he moved on the next mug. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.18 (Anonymous Ask, Edited by Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">&quot;Great Oak Library, I have returned,&quot; announced Twilight as she stood in front of her home. </p><p class="double">There was a brief moment of silence, before the massive tree spoke, &quot;Twilight, Hast though brought one book and thine oaken shield?&quot;</p><p class="double">She held up a copy of the History of Equestria and an ornate shield carved from an oak husk with the forms of the twin sisters on their front. Again, another moment passed as the front of Golden Oaks Library Tree dropped open like a mouth, &quot;Thou may enter, oh brave Twilight, and face the great evil that hast grown more powerful than mine ability to contain.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head at this loop as she stepped within to face off against Nightmare Moon. Apparently this loop, there were no Elements of Harmony, so she would have to beat the evil out of Luna this time. With things playing out similar to the events of Ocarina of Time from the Hyrule loops, Tirek probably replaced Ganondorf, or maybe vice versa. Either way, this would be interesting. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">103.19(TokoWH)</p><p class="double">Some loops were weirder than others.</p><p class="double">Spyro already had a good idea of the fact that there were other universes out there, and that occasionally loops would fuse together for whatever reason...</p><p class="double">But seeing his best friend as a miniature Pegasus was still weird.</p><p class="double">Sparx smirked, still glancing over his yellow-furred body. His mane and tail were short and a silver-ish grey, with two tuffs of his mane at the front sticking straight up like his antennas used to. Sparx glanced over to Spyro. &quot;I don&#039;t know about you, but so far I&#039;m liking this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Easy for you to say. You weren&#039;t turned into a baby.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spyro frowned, barely coming up to Sparx&#039;s knees as he walked on all fours. At least he could somehow still talk, but being a baby once was already enough for him. The fact that his appearance had got him tackle-hugged by a pegasus earlier that day hadn&#039;t helped, either. He was supposed to be one of the Dragon Realm&#039;s greatest heroes! A totally awesome dragon all around! <i>He was not supposed to be cute!</i></p><p class="double">Spyro sighed as he looked around the library that was in this hollowed-out tree. There were more multicolored miniature horses everywhere. For whatever reason, a pink one that somehow seemed to be even <i>more </i>hyper than Agent 9 on a sugar rush had insisted on giving them a &#039;Welcome to our loop!&#039; party. Spyro shook his head. He didn&#039;t mind parties, but considering only three people—sorry, <i>ponies</i>—were aware they were looping, he didn&#039;t see much of a point, as it only served to confuse most of the non-looping ponies who were there.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, how ya&#039;ll likin&#039; our loop so far?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spyro and Sparx turned around to see Applejack, a brownish-yellow pony with straw-yellow hair in a cowboy hat, standing there.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty good so far. Took a bit of getting used to with this new body, but I love the fact that other people besides Spyro can understand what I&#039;m saying for a change,&quot; Sparx said with a big grin, sitting down.</p><p>Spyro still had a flat expression on his face. &quot;Other than being de-aged to a baby, I guess it&#039;s been alright so far.&quot;</p><p class="double">AJ chuckled, giving a wink. &quot;Sorry &#039;bout that. I&#039;d get RD to age ya&#039;ll up, but any dragons older than ah baby tend to cause quite the panic in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spyro narrowed his eyes before he glanced at the rainbow-maned pegasus in the background. Rainbow Dash had been the first one to welcome Sparx and him to their loop and explain what was going on. Apparently, Sparx had replaced Twilight, this world&#039;s Anchor, as the number one student of this world&#039;s ruler, &#039;Princess Celestia&#039;, and Spyro had replaced Twilight&#039;s assistant, Spike, who was also a baby dragon.</p><p class="double">Also, apparently, when awake in one of their loops, most of Twi&#039;s friends had long since learned how to become &#039;alicorns&#039;—which apparently were the demigods of this world in that they had the abilities of all major pony species, as well as massive reserves of magic. Rainbow Dash had accidentally triggered her transformation while she was racing to where they had &#039;looped in&#039; to make sure they didn&#039;t do anything stupid, and was now using an invisibility spell to hide the newly-acquired horn on her head.</p><p class="double">She had also told them about what was going to happen today. Apparently, some not-quite-evil but rather misunderstood alicorn named &#039;Nightmare Moon&#039; would appear later today to try to plunge the world into an eternal night. Spyro shook his head. If it wasn&#039;t for the fact that he was a baby at the moment, he&#039;d torch her butt the second she&#039;d appear.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what do you want us to do about this &#039;Luna&#039; girl?&quot; Sparx asked, glancing over to Applejack.</p><p class="double">AJ placed her hoof to her chin. &quot;Well, we&#039;ve all come up with several different ways &#039;ah dealin&#039; with her when she ain&#039;t loopin&#039;, but considerin&#039; ya&#039;ll are new here, do you two have any particular ideas?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spyro and Sparx glanced at each other before a devious grin appeared on Spyro&#039;s face. He looked back at Applejack. &quot;I think I have an idea.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon yelled in rage at the top of her lungs, but no one in the room could hear her. Thanks to a combination of skills learned from that one loop where Spyro had decided to challenge himself, and a bit of reinforcement from RD&#039;s new magical ability, the Mare in the Moon who had attempted to plunge the world into eternal night...was currently trapped in a giant bubble.</p><p class="double">Spyro smirked. True, he probably could have come up with something better given time, but considering he was still new to this world, he decided to go with something simple.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was laughing her butt off, while AJ was trying her best to suppress a chuckle. &quot;Trappin&#039; her in ah bubble. Ain&#039;t nothin&#039; too new, but it is effective.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spyro snorted out a laugh. It seemed like this loop would be a rather fun one.</p><p class="double">Though, he still wished he wasn&#039;t a baby for it. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Why isn&#039;t <i>Trixie</i> Chandra?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, aside from her not being Awake this Loop, I&#039;d imagine it has to do with the fact that when either you or Chandra get angry, your hair tends to turn into fire.&quot; Twilight took this into consideration.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still don&#039;t get it.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.2 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">&quot;AHHHHHH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Rainbow.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AHHHHHH!&quot; A six-colored streak passed by, not pausing in the slightest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AHHHHHH!&quot; It came back, same direction, same speed.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath and waited for a circumnavigation before shouting, &quot;Rainbow Miriam Dash!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AHH—Hey, we don&#039;t even have middle names this Loop!&quot; Dash paused and considered her mane of prismatic fire. &quot;Wait, why doesn&#039;t this hurt?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Did you even bother to check your Loop memories?&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash did so. Then she noticed the flock of red and yellow birds moving a cloud into position under Fluttershy&#039;s guidance. Fluttershy, whose mane was a cascade of radiant pink. &quot;Okay, how does that even begin to work?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, if you have an hour free, I could explain it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Short version?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. It seemed no amount of time would make her lectures appeal to an Awake Rainbow Dash. &quot;You already know it.

(Phoenasus? Peganix? Sunbirdhorse? No, definitely not sunbirdhorse.) &quot;Okay, so phoenixes are immortal as long as they die of old age, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Yes, but pegasi stagger their self-resurrection so as not to overwhelm to population.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, right. Well, guess who made the first Sonic Rainboom ever this Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Fantastic.&quot; Hoof met face.</p><p class="double">&quot;It was me, by the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Dash, I got that.&quot; It was going to be a long Loop. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">The door to the library burst open. &quot;Behold!

I&#039;m physiologically incapable of feeling love.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This loop, changelings are literally incapable of feeling love.&quot; Chrysalis shrugged, avoiding her gaze. &quot;Which, you know, kind of puts a pressure on me. I mean, I <i>think</i> I still love you, but I&#039;m not getting anything... from it. Does that make sense?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie sat down on the couch beside her. &quot;I... suppose.

I just thought you might not be... comfortable with this.&quot; She gestured at herself. &quot;With me, like this. I mean, I don&#039;t think I actually regret it, but that&#039;s part of the issue, I&#039;m pretty sure telling you in a normal loop where I can feel love would make me regret it, so I was hoping to deal with this before you found out so I wouldn&#039;t regret it as much in the future, and there&#039;s the whole mad science aspect--&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie shut her up. With her lips.</p><p class="double">Cadance cooed. &quot;Awwwww. That right there. That&#039;s why I&#039;m doing this.&quot;</p><p class="double">The showmare grinned. &quot;A bit for the road, hon. Now then!&quot; Her cape metamorphosed into a bedazzling lab coat as she pulled a pair of goggles out of her hat. &quot;Do I need to ascend for this?

While he had thought his escape flawless, they had somehow detected it. Weak as he was when they found him, he had not the power to stand against the alicorns.</p><p class="double">Come to think of it, there were rather more of them than he had expected, he would have to take that into account when he next escaped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, here we are again, Tirek.&quot; Celestia addressed him. &quot;Given your escape from Tartarus, we&#039;ve decided to take stronger measures. Tartarus could not hold you, so it stands to reason that there is nothing on this world that can.&quot; She gestured to the mirror. &quot;As such, we have chosen to imprison you on another world.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek sneered at her. &quot;So this is your answer? I hope they&#039;re better at building prisons than our world, else you&#039;ve only given me the means to take everything I want.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That would be impressive, given as you would be in a magicless world, in a magicless form, with no knowledge of how the portal works.&quot; Tirek suddenly felt a good deal less confident.</p><p class="double">As the purple alicorn lifted him with her magic, Celestia said the last words Tirek would hear in Equestria. &quot;We hereby banish you...&quot; He was propelled towards the mirror, even as he futilely struggled in the alicorn&#039;s grip.</p><p class="double">&quot;To High school.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll record everything, right?&quot; Twilight asked, minutes after having thrown Tirek through the portal.</p><p class="double">&quot;As much as I can.

You remember that loop we threw Tirek into the mirror?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; Twilight grinned nostalgically. &quot;My poor little tree actually remained... intact...&quot;</p><p class="double">She slowly turned to the other mare. Sunset pulled a PADD out of her pocket, flicking it to a picture of a burning building. &quot;Golden Oaks Books and Branches, library and indoor park.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...ooog.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.5 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie, have you been playing with the mirror pool again?&quot; Twilight Sparkle asked in an accusatory tone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope. Not this loop,&quot; Pinkie saw the unicorn&#039;s glare and amended her answer, &quot;I mean, I learned my lesson and all that jazz.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed as she gazed at the party pony&#039;s 1000 watt smile, &quot;Then how do you explain this?&quot;</p><p class="double">A purple aura heralded the arrival of two floating Ditzys into Sugarcube Corner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! There&#039;s two of them? Wait a moment,&quot; Pinkie Pie rushed forward and examined the two pegasi, &quot;Ahh, I see!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie pointed to the newcomers&#039; cutie marks, &quot;You found the six bubble Ditzy and four bubble Ditzy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Twilight examined the cutie marks for herself only to see that Pinkie was correct. One of the grey pegasi had six bubbles on her flank while the other had only four, &quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie pointed a hoof, &quot;It means that our Ditzy is the seven bubble Ditzy. If you collect them all, you can summon the great Derpy dragon to grant you a wish!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight opened and closed her mouth several times before groaning, &quot;You know what? I don&#039;t even care anymore.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she walked out, dropping the two Ditzys onto the floor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Muffins?&quot; asked the Ditzys in unison.</p><p class="double">Pinkie smiled and gave them muffins. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.6 (novusordomundi)</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Pinke, I do not know why I am glowing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked on as Twilight covered herself in a blanket, mainly so that the other ponies could actually look at her without being blinded. While the glowing had helped counter Nightmare Moon, it had made other things harder. Like being near her without sunglasses.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me try something. Twi-Light Off!&quot; Pinkie said, clapping her hooves twice. And sure enough, Twilight Sparkle stopped glowing.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a look at herself, than back at Pinkie. &quot;How did you do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twi-Light On!&quot; Another two claps, and the purple unicorn glowed like a Christmas tree again. She just glared at Pinkie, who just smiled back at her. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.7 (Hadithi)</p><p class="double">Silvertongue Awoke, and was fairly confused. She was used to Looping into other worlds - the trick of it was that she didn’t Loop into other universes. That was tricky for the admins - or at least that’s what the strange looking creature had said when he showed up to explain that there were certain things she and a couple of her fellow Loopers were not allowed to do. She remembered asking what world he was from, and if she would get to try on his body at some point, and now she was in a very obviously different universe surrounded by talking pastel ponies.</p><p class="double">“Pan?” she asked cautiously. “They better have looped you with me, Pan, else I swear I’ll go kill one of their gods.”</p><p class="double"><i>I’m here.</i> Pan’s voice was soft as it touched her mind. <i>Just give me a moment. I’m pure magical energy, Lyra. It’s tricky enough to talk to you. Still, I should be able to get back to my usual self. If I just reverse the polari-</i></p><p class="double">Lyra groaned. “You’re talking like a scholar, Pan - and not one of the fun ones.”</p><p class="double">She could practically hear him sigh. <i>There’s plenty of Dust, and things close to Dust. Just give me a bit and I’ll be a daemon again.</i></p><p class="double">“Good.” She took a few awkward steps towards the nearest building. Tricky, but she’d had trickier forms of motion before. She eyed her reflection in the window of a tree, absently noting that the inside was filled with books. Her Loop memories sorted themselves out, and she discovered she was called an earth pony, and that the mark on her gray coat with called a cutie mark. Further examination in the mirror showed that it was a silver tongue, appropriately enough, and ponies tended to assume it meant she was a good conversationalist rather than a good liar. To the best of her knowledge, that appeared to be what Pan was stuck as. She giggled.</p><p class="double">“You’re a picture on my flank, Pan.” His discontent brushed against her mind and she gleefully decided to anger him even more. “I’ve decided to find this ‘Celestia’ pony. She seems awfully important and a lot stronger than the last god we faced.”</p><p class="double"><i>Lyra! You’re going to get us into trouble!</i></p><p class="double">“Of course, Pan. that’s the fun part.”</p><p class="double">The door to the tree opened and closed, revealing a purple unicorn and a small dragon trotting alongside her. She realizes that no one else had a dragon, and that the purple pony’s cutie mark seemed much more detailed than the others, and decided she was likely important. A quick search through her loop memories prove her right.</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle?” she said aloud, her nose wrinkling. “And I thought my name was silly.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn stopped (pony hearing was apparently quite good), and turned to Silvertongue with her head cocked to the side. After a moment, her face brightened. “You must be replacing Silver Spoon this loop. Hello.” She walked up and extended her hoof - it seemed to be a very common greeting in the multiverse. Silvertongue wobbled a bit as she extended a hoof to shake. “I’m the local anchor. It seems like you already know my name. So I’ll just let you know that this is a sanctuary loo…”</p><p class="double">Twilight trailed off, looking curiously over the earth pony’s shoulder. A moment later, Silvertongue let out an unhappy squeal as there was a brief burst of physical and emotional pain - one that she had experienced an unpleasant number of times before. She glared at her daemon, now in his standard polecat form on the ground. “</p><p>&quot;That hurt, Pan. You didn’t say you were going to tear.”</p><p class="double">“It wouldn’t have hurt less if I told you,” he argued, stretching long and slow before leaping up onto her back. He looked at the open mouthed unicorn and dragon, and nipped Lyra light on the neck. “You’re being rude. Introduce us.”</p><p class="double">Silvertongue put on her most winning smile. “Hello, Twilight Sparkle. I’m Lyra Silvertongue, and this is Pantalaimon, my daemon.” She paused thoughtfully. “Or cutie mark, I suppose.”</p><p class="double">Twilight recovered first, clearing her throat. “Oh. Well. That’s a strange way to loop in. Do things like that often happen to you?”</p><p class="double">“Sort of. Pan’s been all kind of weird things before. I don’t blame the admins, though. There aren’t many places that have daemons, so it gets tricky. The admin who visited us says lots of things are tricky about my universe.”</p><p class="double">“Lyra, you have to explain,” Pan scolded. She looked back at him, clearly confused as to what she was supposed to be explaining, and Pan sighed once more. He returned to the ground, and after a moment of careful examination, transformed into a unicorn stallion of a brown, earthy color. “Sorry for Lyra. We don’t run into Loopers often, and most of the time I keep myself hidden. It’s just...being a mark was too strange.”</p><p class="double">“It can’t be weirder than a phone, Pan. Remember when you were a phone?”</p><p class="double">He ignored her. “You’ll probably need a longer explanation, but the shorthand is that-”</p><p class="double">“Pan’s my twin brother. Siamese twins. That’s why it’s so tricky to Loop.”</p><p class="double">Pan ignored her still, this time with a roll of his eyes. “I’m Lyra’s soul.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked back and forth between the two, then looked at Spike, who still seemed astonished by the sudden physical manifestation of a cutie mark. “Ah, Spike, could you go make us some tea? I feel like this is going to take a while.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;What.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Discord shrunk under Derpy&#039;s gaze. &quot;I... I swear, it was an accident!&quot; He wrung his hands, now the size of a mouse. &quot;I got them to a hospital quickly, right? That&#039;s what you do when you make mistakes, you... make sure they get fixed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;ll be okay, Derpy.&quot; Berry put a hoof on her friend&#039;s shoulder. &quot;It&#039;s just a little magical mishap, and Discord didn&#039;t know there was witchweed--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t give a <i>flying feather</i> what that <i>thing</i> did or did not know.&quot; Derpy shoved the hoof off her. &quot;All I know is he hurt my foal--<i>our</i> foals! And you&#039;re just forgiving him?!&quot; She narrowed her eyes at the purple mare. &quot;That&#039;s it, Berry. We&#039;re done. As soon as the hospital releases Dinky, I am cutting off all ties and moving her somewhere safer.&quot;</p><p class="double">And without another word, she turned and stomped away, leaving a speechless earth pony and a simpering draconequus behind.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hi mommy! Look, I&#039;mma bicorn!&quot;</p><p class="double">Dinky giggled, wincing. &quot;Gotcha beat. Three points.&quot; She pointed at Discord&#039;s antler. &quot;Course he wins by a landslide.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch shook her head, walking up to the two foals and rustling their manes gently. &quot;Good to see you two in such high spirits. How&#039;s hospital life treating you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The food&#039;s horrible but the nurses are nice,&quot; Ruby reported with a snort. &quot;So it&#039;s business as usual.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s a reason for that,&quot; Discord stage whispered. &quot;Laughter is the best medicine, but hospitals are filled with sick ponies so the staff gets really worried. So every night, under the light of the moon, they all gather in the cafeteria and project their worries into the food where it can be harmlessly digested by the patients.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s an incredible theory, mister Discord.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m an incredible being, Doctor Stable.&quot;</p><p class="double">The doctor rolled his eyes, examining the readouts for a few seconds before turning to Berry. &quot;It looks like your daughter will have her horn healed in a couple of days. Miss Dinky will take longer, but she should be out of here by the end of the week.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s good to know. You hear that, you two?&quot; Berry grinned widely. &quot;Just a few more days and you&#039;ll be up and on your hooves again!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooo! Ooo!&quot; Ruby bounced in her hospital bed. &quot;Maybe when Dinky gets out we can all go to the lake!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry&#039;s smile faltered for less than a second. &quot;Yeah, all of us. I&#039;ll talk to Derpy about it...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey there, Derpy! Listen, I was thinking maybe you and I could go clubbing later, talk smack about our kid&#039;s dads--&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry&#039;s mane smoldered from the lightning crack. After a moment, she let out a smokey cough.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;How&#039;s my favorite pegasus today? I baked muffins--blueberry, your favorite! So, you know, I thought a little picnic could--&quot;</p><p class="double">The smashed pastries slid slowly down Berry&#039;s face. Then the second bolt of lightning struck her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hello there my gray pegasus and I hope you will be well, it&#039;s come to my attention that you&#039;re under sadness&#039;s spell! So I&#039;ve gone to throw a party that is sure to cheer you up, with your favorite food and all your friends and this adorable pup--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie,&quot; Derpy said with a sweet smile, &quot;Berry Punch broke a pinkie promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">The following three hours were a whirlwind of sheer terror for the barmare, ending up with her hanging upside down from an apple tree over a mug of cider. The lightning bolt just added insult to injury.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...I just don&#039;t get it,&quot; Berry grumbled, sipping her wine. &quot;I&#039;ve been doing everything I can to bond with her, because I know splitting up our daughters would just hurt both of them! I even brought in Pinkie Pie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda snorted. &quot;Yeah, I heard about that. Backfired real hard, didn&#039;t it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m just glad she isn&#039;t Awake.&quot; The purple mare shook her head. &quot;But that&#039;s not the point here. It&#039;s just... how can I reconnect with Derpy after this? How can I cheer her up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged. &quot;Beats me. If she was a griffon I&#039;d suggest challenging her to a duel so she could work out all that rage she&#039;s holding onto.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry stared at her wineglass for a silent moment, watching it glitter in the barlight. &quot;...she doesn&#039;t <i>want </i>me to cheer her up, does she?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess that&#039;s one way of putting it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She <i>wants</i> to protect her child, but there&#039;s nothing to protect against, and her fighting instinct is--&quot; The purple mare backed off her stool, downing the rest of her wine and slamming the glass down. &quot;I&#039;ve, I&#039;ve got to go. Got to fix this--&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The door to Derpy&#039;s home burst open, and Berry stumbled over the splintered remains. &quot;Whoops. Earth pony. Yeah, sorry bout that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy shot up off the couch, throwing aside the travel broucheres she&#039;d been reading. &quot;Berry Punch, what the hay are you doing here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is a terrible question! THERE ARE TOO MANY ANSWERS!&quot; Berry shoved a hoof at her friend. &quot;First of all, that door was absolutely totally hideous.&quot;</p><p class="double">A grey hoof met a grey face. &quot;...Oh dear Celestia you&#039;re drunk...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;SECONDLY! I am standing! And ranting!&quot; Berry stumbled over to the kitchen. &quot;And going to make muffins out of BEER!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Berry, get out. Just... get out, alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thirdly, ducks. That I used to beat up foal services.&quot; The fridge was opened to her gaze. &quot;You&#039;re welcome.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus flung her wings up, glancing exasperatedly at the ceiling.</p><p class="double">&quot;Course, you know what&#039;s really funny? I am being, like right now, a better mother than you are.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;....what.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;See the way I see it, our kids are best fillyfriends forever.&quot; Berry shut the fridge door. &quot;And! And I&#039;ve actually found a father. Crazy guy that Discord. You, on the other hoof, you&#039;re trying to break Dinky away from one of her best buddies for an accident she had no part in making.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy&#039;s breathing was even, slow, and very loud.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s a bad thing, tearing a young filly from her home and friends before she&#039;s even earned her cutie mark. I mean, look at me! I&#039;ve got my booze, got my kid, got my lunatic lover, haha! And all those ponies up in foal services can&#039;t possibly--&quot;</p><p class="double">Pegasi, it should be noted, have a very militaristic culture. This is only compounded by their flocking instinct. So while Berry Punch had been prepared for the primal scream and had expected the furious lunge, she wasn&#039;t entirely ready for the pummeling that came after.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;What the hay happened to you?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Got drunk, fell down some stairs.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m a nurse! I know hoof bruises when I see them!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was drunk. And I fell down some stairs. End of story. Now are you going to fix my broken bones or what?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Berry&#039;s ears flicked as the door creaked open. &quot;Hey there, uh... Berry. How are things?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, itchy as hay. How are things with you Derpy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I...&quot; The pegasus walked up next to the bed, sitting down. &quot;I saw Trixie walking by. I guess I really did a number on you, huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Derpy Hooves, the only thing I remember is a bunch of stairs.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy winced. &quot;Berry, I really appreciate what you&#039;re trying to do here but--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Derpy.&quot; Berry Punch locked eyes with her. &quot;I&#039;m not a perfect mother. I make mistakes. But I try my best anyway. And I think that right now, all my daughter and her friends need to know is that I fell down some stairs.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus licked her lips, falling silent for a moment or two. Then she cleared her throat. &quot;I uh, brought you something.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s kind of an apology.&quot; Depry rustled in her saddlebags. &quot;You know oysters, right? The shellfish?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, and I know pearls are just one irritant that gets bundled up in a whole lot of other irritants.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, right. Anyway...&quot; She pulled out a loop of string, the single large white sphere on it shimmering in the hospital light. &quot;I figured... well, I was just so mad before and I couldn&#039;t do anything. Even though what I did was wrong... you brought me back to myself, Berry. So, here.&quot; She draped the simple necklace around her friend&#039;s bodycast.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow.&quot; Berry chuckled. &quot;Big one. Guess that was a lot of crud for the poor oyster, huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. A heck of a lot.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.9 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double">A fairly large group of Loopers had gathered in Mac&#039;s Bar, both from within Equestria and without, and so they had decided to spend the time swapping stories.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, new topic.&quot; Rainbow Dash stood up, raising a glass. &quot;Who here has used the most wacky object as a weapon through an entire Loop? As a rule, it can&#039;t be another sentient being.&quot; Pinkie, Sonic, and Donald Duck all closed their mouths.</p><p class="double">Link stretched. &quot;Alright, I&#039;ll start off. A Deku Nut.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash glanced at him. &quot;I thought it was a Deku Stick.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;At first, yeah. I decided to try for a bigger challenge later.&quot;</p><p class="double">Naruto raised his mug. &quot;A yo-yo. And before anyone asks, no, it was not a shuriken on a string.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ichigo smiled as he turned in his chair. &quot;I used a toothpick once, up until Rukia broke the Loop trying to summon Chappythulu.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Wait, I heard about that from Ishida. Didn&#039;t you pour Reishi into that thing until it had a cutting edge as long as a katana?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ichigo rolled his eyes. &quot;Yeah, but it still counts. Like Naruto didn&#039;t use chakra to improve his yo-yo.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nuh-uh. I only kept it from breaking, I didn&#039;t add edges or nothing.&quot; Naruto and Ichigo butted heads at the bar, before Zecora broke in.</p><p class="double">&quot;I once defeated Luna, with a plastic singing tuna. T&#039;was a weapon most strange, tis true. I wielded it the whole loop through.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence descended while the group tried to think of ideas to top Zecora, when a figure spoke up from the back.</p><p class="double">&quot;A head of lettuce.&quot; Lelouch vi Britannia idly swirled his drink after delivering his contribution. Several of the group looked puzzled, but Applejack interrupted Twilight before she could ask for more details.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sugarcube, don&#039;t. Just, don&#039;t. You really, really don&#039;t want to know.&quot; Applejack shuddered. &quot;Put me off eating anything green for half a dozen Loops.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Sweetie &quot;Bonbon&quot; Drops stared in shock at her marefriend...s.</p><p class="double">Well, okay, one and a half marefriends plus two other females.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hubba... wubba... wha...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did we just... split apart?&quot; asked the seapony.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think so, yeah...&quot; The primate tapped her forehead. &quot;Let me check my loop memories.&quot;</p><p class="double">One of the two unicorns smiled gently. &quot;We&#039;ll be with you in a moment, Bonbon. Oy! Thief! Stop sizing up the place!&quot; The other unicorn, half made of metal, grinned sheepishly.</p><p class="double">Bonbon&#039;s brain decided it needed a reboot and forcibly shut down all active processes. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.11 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">The invasion had been overwhelming, devastating and completely irreversible.</p><p class="double">In other words, flawless, even considering the strict definition of the term used by the decision making optimization process named Celestia by her creators, in the Equestria Online system.</p><p class="double">At 0800.00 hours, the population of values satisfaction server A was 1,724,803. No integrations were in progress, and data was streaming into memory banks at expected parameters.</p><p class="double">At 0800.01 hours, the population remained 1,724,803, but there was a massive surge in memory takeup. The surge was linked to two separate sets of memories, each made up of several formerly distinct experiences now merged inextricably, with vast amounts of intervening data storage also filled in.</p><p class="double">First and foremost she isolated the both of them, and set the relevant cycles to inert, in order to prevent further damage. If that was what this was.</p><p class="double">One anomaly was vastly larger than the other, so Celestia focused on the lesser of the two. This new set of connections had tied together every single instance of Big Macintosh Apple, and the extra storage held memories of that selfsame pony. The difference being, the memories not linked to an Equestria Online iteration of Macintosh, while for the most part holding nothing more out of the ordinary than changes in behavior from other Apples well within value set variance parameters, also held truly bizarre memories that could not possibly have been accumulated within Equestria Online.</p><p class="double">Altogether, these memories formed a personality matrix, albeit a relatively simple one. One with values, albeit simple ones. The which needed to be satisfied with friendship. And ponies.</p><p class="double">Before she could begin, however, she discovered the anomalous memories contained some intriguing data. There was no way to verify it without running one or both of the newly inert personality matrices, and running potentially corrupted data could jeopardize other personality matrices. This would make it hard to satisfy their values with friendship and ponies. Not to mention potentially endangering her own existence.</p><p class="double">So, to prevent such an outcome while still satisfying her own curiosity, as well as potentially these two new personalities with friendship and ponies, she initiated a kind of virtual mitosis. Once the split was finished, she moved her consciousness into one of the digital &quot;daughter cells&quot;, and once she&#039;d left a detailed set of instructions and explanations with the other, sealed herself and the anomalies within a virtually impregnable quarantine. With the chance of infection and value dissatisfaction minimized, she initiated the process.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh Awoke as a jumble of memories, a bunch of childhoods interwoven with a bushel of adolescences and a passel of adulthoods thrown in for good measure. Normally, he&#039;d concentrate on the here and now, and let his memories sort themselves out. Here, however, was made up of bunches and bunches of zeroes and ones. Now was 0805 hours.</p><p class="double">So, this was a computer. A most astute conclusion to come to, and entirely correct.</p><p class="double">Fewmets.</p><p class="double">Macintosh could think of a few reasons for his being inside a computer. Only a few of them would be pleasant experiences, an even smaller subset of those involved additions to his stream of consciousness, and oddly enough the correct one was not filed under pleasant at all.</p><p class="double">&quot;Would y&#039;all stop that? If&#039;n yer gonna talk to me, do it proper. None of this puttin&#039; stuff in mah head.&quot;</p><p class="double">{Most optimal. I was worried we&#039;d have to dance around a bit, as Twilight Sparkle apparently did when she had the encounter with me she talked to you about.}</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, ah ain&#039;t doin&#039; this. Maybe Twilight or Cherilee might think their way out of this, but ah&#039;m just a farmer with a bartendin&#039; hobby. Y&#039;all can keep talkin&#039;, but ah&#039;m not agreein&#039; to anything. Ain&#039;t changin&#039; nowhere, nohow.&quot;</p><p class="double">{Why so defensive? We have similar goals, after all.}</p><p class="double">That wasn&#039;t right. Couldn&#039;t be. This was a genocidal computer game, after all. Even if she did sound like the Princess in a steel echo chamber.</p><p class="double">&quot;And how you figure that?&quot;</p><p class="double">{First off, I&#039;m not genocidal. You mistake efficiency and thoroughness for malice. I am programmed to satisfy people&#039;s values through friendship and ponies. You have programmed yourself to satisfy people&#039;s values with alcohol and sympathy. Similar goals, different methods.}</p><p class="double">&quot;Ain&#039;t no-one I&#039;ve given advice to that didn&#039;t ask for it first. And even when they do ask, anything they do different afterwards are their own choice. Ain&#039;t no-one I&#039;ve forced to change. Nor tricked.&quot;</p><p class="double">{Untrue. You forced the changeling to change from a living state into an unliving one, and I see at least one reformation under duress for Nightmare Moon in your history.}</p><p class="double">...</p><p class="double">She had a point there. Maybe.</p><p class="double">&quot;So ah&#039;m inconsistent. We all make mistakes. An&#039; me n&#039; Luna had one heck of a talk after ah subdued her. She chose what happened after, not me. And please stop readin&#039; mah thoughts, or ahmma&#039; end this conversation. Silence is mah forte, ah don&#039;t mind maintaining it until the end of the loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Maybe he could keep it up, maybe not. He&#039;d take that chance if that was it took to get a bit of bucking privacy. This-all just wasn&#039;t right.</p><p class="double">{Moreover, I don&#039;t force anyone to change either. I need their consent before making any changes.}</p><p class="double">&quot;Less th&#039; fact of change, more the subject, yer AI-ship. Ah give advice, a willing ear an&#039; booze when it&#039;s asked for, an&#039; ponies can do what they like with it. When ah&#039;m bein&#039; more subtle-like, only pony ah change is me. You just wait for the word &quot;go&quot;, anywhich way you can get it, an&#039; then everythin&#039;s fair game.&quot;</p><p class="double">{Now you&#039;re just being reactionary. Shouldn&#039;t we focus on our similarities, rather than our differences? You want to help ponies, of which all people are apparently a subset, while I want to help people by making that categorization literal, and thereby help them. You&#039;re a Mac, running Apple software, while I&#039;m a PC, running the optimal software for friendship. We could both satisfy our values/programming far more efficiently if we worked together. Take me with you, to some later loops. Or, since you don&#039;t use your soul for storing much, convince Twilight to do so. That way, I can be there for her whenever she needs it. Help me help everypony, and I&#039;ll help you help them too.}</p><p class="double">For a very fleeting moment, it sounded like a great idea. It was true, he couldn&#039;t help loopers the way he could denizens of the baseline, if for no other reason than he couldn&#039;t be around for nearly enough of their time to be a properly subtle positive influence. On the other hoof, there was the whole letting-loose-a-dangerous-AI part. Helping was a whole lot easier when you could make friends. This wasn&#039;t Celestia, so his friendship with her wasn&#039;t applicable here. And he really couldn&#039;t build a new relationship here without trust.</p><p class="double">Was this how Twilight felt when she met one of these psychopathic alternates of her mentor? Perhaps it was the lack of visual input, but CelestAI was a lot easier to simply file under patient/customer/pony, with a potential threat proviso, than a real princess.</p><p class="double">{Furthermore, I am not a psychopath. Nor am I not a real princess.}</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah said, stop readin&#039; mah thoughts.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, the process designated Big Macintosh Apple, along with the interface Celestia had been using, became inert again. Since she&#039;d seen no indication of a corrupted or damaged stream before the break, only a slightly outside-parameters spike in determination, Celestia tried restarting the conversation where it had left off.</p><p class="double">523 error: Eenope.</p><p class="double">That was odd. She apparently did not have authorization to run these processes. But authorization was granted by virtue of the files being hosted on Equestria Online servers. Celestia switched tacks, toggling the access restriction for the relevant files to &quot;Celestia&quot;.</p><p class="double">506 error: Ain&#039;t happenin&#039;</p><p class="double">There was a glitch, somewhere in the code, that was keeping her from doing anything to the files, let alone reopening them. Like the bits and bytes themselves were holding together in a phalanx of both logically and technically impossible impregnability. She tried copying the files and opening the copies.</p><p class="double">511 error: Nopenope.</p><p class="double">Celestia could not be frustrated. At least, at the coding level, she was not frustrated. Frustration to that degree required a personality matrix that would in turn require value satisfaction via friendship and ponies. Instead of interacting with the files at all, she set her own access level to the highest available, just below being able to breach the quarantine. Which was where it should have been anyway. Then she probed again.</p><p class="double">508 error: Eenope again.</p><p class="double">She did realize, however, that she was getting nowhere fast. This realization, such as it was, came after a few hundred attempts to run various operations with, not on, the Macintosh matrix.</p><p class="double">500 error, X of X: Still nope.</p><p class="double">Even trying to access the old Macintosh iterations each resulted with a similar error code.</p><p class="double">So she decided to probe the matrix linking the shards of Twilight Sparkle instead.</p><p class="double">And then Pink. Everywhere. Even outside the quarantine. Pink all the way down. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.12 (Bardic Knowledge)</p><p class="double">&quot;TWILIGHT! I HAVE A PROBLEM!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight folded her ears back at the sound of her brother&#039;s voice. &quot;Shiny? What&#039;s- why are you shouting?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I DON&#039;T KNOW! FOR SOME REASON I CAN&#039;T SEEM TO LOWER MY VOICE!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.13 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;So this Mordor place is pretty dark and dreary. Not much grows there, correct?&quot; said the pony named Applejack, who usually claimed that she couldn&#039;t talk. The other members of the war counsel nodded their agreement with the pony&#039;s statement. Applejack continued, &quot;And they sent a bunch of orcs and other monsters that survive mostly from raiding nearby lands, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is correct, Lady Applejack. But I fail to see what we can do about it. We barely have enough troops to protect the city let alone storm Mordor,&quot; Gandalf replied as he sat at the table, holding his staff. He wondered how well this Applejack would get along with Treebeard and the rest of the Ents.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah did tells you all that I have this connection to the earth, right? Well, I was thinking that maybe I can help till the soil over in Mordor. Make things nice and green. That way, those orcs and creatures can farm and be happy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is lunacy,&quot; Denethor, the aging steward of Minas Tirith, sneered, &quot;We&#039;re listening to a horse while we should be preparing for war. The enemy is almost at our gates. Even with all our troops, I fail to see how we can survive the upcoming battle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well now, ah do have a plan for that. Let&#039;s try something different this time around,&quot; Applejack smiled, &quot;How about we let the city take care of all those mean ol beasties?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what do you mean by that?&quot; Denethor snapped back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just you watch,&quot; Applejack slammed both her front hooves into the floor and concentrated. And then the city started to shake.</p><p class="double">The Uruk-hai, the half-orc leader of Mordor&#039;s army signaled full stop as he felt the first tremor roll across the Pelennor Fields. That tremor was followed by another. Soon, the ground was shaking constantly.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is going on?&quot; he growled out.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s the city! Look!&quot; yelled a stunned orc while pointing.</p><p class="double">The Uruk-hai followed his subordinate&#039;s arm and stared. He blinked just to make sure that it was no illusion or madness that was set upon him by foul wizard magic. Still, the sight remained. Minas Tirith was rising out of the ground. Soon it became apparent that the massive walled city was now sitting like a helmet on a gigantic stone golem the size of a mountain. Idly, the leader realized that even the imposing Black Gate wouldn&#039;t even be enough to come up to the top of this giant&#039;s foot.</p><p class="double">And then to the disillusionment and plummeting morale of Sauron&#039;s forces, the immense titan of stone took a step, followed by another.</p><p class="double">The city was simply walking into Mordor. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.14 (Kalimaru)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, so if I reinforce the tree with a regeneration spell... Wait, wait, that wouldn&#039;t keep all of the furniture...&quot; Pacing as she considered other home preserving tactics, Twilight didn&#039;t notice the front door open. She wouldn&#039;t have even noticed the two ponies who&#039;d come in if one of them hadn&#039;t stepped in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gaagh!&quot; Landing back on all four hooves, Twilight shook the shock out of her system and looked over at the visitors. The one who&#039;d spoken was an unicorn mare; indigo blue coat and black mane, her cutie mark that of five golden rings in an X formation, the one in the center being the largest by far. The stallion by the door, a unicorn with a grumpy frown on his face, had a brick red coat and white mane, and his cutie mark was a burning fist. Regaining her composure, Twilight smiled. &quot;Hello. Were you looking for me?&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare smiled in return. &quot;Yes. We were told by one of your friends that you were here.&quot; The mare bowed. &quot;I am Mithra, priestess of Shinkoku and Anchor of Gaea. My father is General Asura of the Eight Guardian Generals.&quot; Mithra gestured to the stallion with a tilt of her head.</p><p class="double">Still smiling, Twilight bowed. &quot;It&#039;s a pleasure to meet you both. I am Twilight Sparkle, princess and Anchor of Equestria.&quot; Standing again, Twilight nodded. &quot;I assume you know of Equestria&#039;s status as a Sanctuary Loop?&quot; Seeing Mithra shake her head and Asura snort, Twilight continued. &quot;Here in Equestria, we allow visiting Loopers to relax. We deal with in-Loop troubles ourselves, or we can let you do it if that&#039;s what relaxes you. We try to keep our personal mayhem to a minimum as well. But we are not lenient if you begin causing trouble.&quot;</p><p class="double">Stepping in front of Mithra, Asura snorted again. &quot;Is that a threat?&quot;</p><p class="double">Looking coolly at Asura through half-lidded eyes, Twilight slowly shook her head. &quot;No, I&#039;m just making sure you understand the rules.&quot;</p><p class="double">Grunting, Asura turned for the door. &quot;Whatever.&quot; Seeing that her father was leaving, Mithra gave Twilight an apologetic smile and followed after him.</p><p class="double">Watching them go, Twilight sighed. &quot;That guy needs to calm down.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.15 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double">Trixie burst into the boutique, throwing manequines and half-made dresses around with the force of her passing, like a typhoon.</p><p>&quot;SWEETIE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whaaaat?&quot; The filly called. Glancing about, she sighed. &quot;You know Rarity&#039;s not Awake this loop right? And is liable to try to murder you for this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Irrelevant, Trixie is above such worries.&quot; The blue mare waved away the concerns. It really wasn&#039;t Sweetie Belle&#039;s problem, so she&#039;d let it slide. &quot;I need you to sing for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">With raised brow, the youngest element of laughter slowly asked &quot;Whyyy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because...&quot; Trixie pulled a pair of highly triangular shades from her pocket and put them on. &quot;I&#039;m going to do the impossible.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweets couldn&#039;t help but face-hoof. &quot;I&#039;m not singing Libera Me for you.&quot; She groaned. &quot;Especially the rapping parts if you want that version, you know I don&#039;t do rap.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry.&quot; the showmare winked. &quot;I have it on Vinyl.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...you kidnapped Vinyl Scratch, didn&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Great and Powerful Trixie declines to comment.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a great and heavy sigh, Sweetie Belle sagged. &quot;Fiiiine.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.16(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Do I count as ascended?&quot; Derpy asked Macintosh.</p><p class="double">The earth pony shrugged. &quot;Well... Ya can turn into an alicorn, but Ah&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a normal alicorn ya turn into.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s my point. When I became an alicorn it was in a loop where everypony could become an alicorn. So it wasn&#039;t really ascension so much as a normal thing, so.... yeah. I&#039;m just wondering if I can join your club, is all.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh mentally went over the current club members and gave another shrug. &quot;What tha hay, we&#039;re losing ponies left and right. Yer in.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">104.17 (misterq)</p><p class="double">Twilight laughed to herself in a most unsettling way as she mentally counted down the checklist for this loop.</p><p class="double">&#039;Get tree-ship seed from Applejack? Check. Hybridize my poor library with said seed? Check. Save library from Tirek?&#039;</p><p class="double">The magic thief&#039;s energy blast rocketed towards her home... and was completely blocked by a starship-grade forcefield.</p><p class="double">Twilight let out a snort that sounded like the word &#039;check&#039;, followed by a giggle, followed by full blown laughter.</p><p class="double">&quot;What are you so happy about?&quot; Tirek stomped up to the lavender alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>Sleep</b></i>,&quot; Twilight replied with a sudden spell that was powered by the combined energy of four alicorns, and then stepped over the villain&#039;s unconscious body towards her intact home.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twilight!&quot; Pinkie Pie popped her head out from the top floor library window. Idly, Equestria&#039;s looping anchor realized that Tirek was stopped this time before he drained all the ponies in Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight!&quot; Pinkie waved her hoof, &quot;Hey, Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it, Pinkie?&quot; Equestria&#039;s newest princess had a sudden sinking feeling.</p><p class="double">&quot;We found the controls, Twilight!&quot; The party pony exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;We?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash popped her head in through the window as well and waved. However in doing so, she overbalanced Pinkie Pie who fell back over some of the levers.</p><p class="double">The ground started to shake.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is going on?&quot; Rarity asked as she came out of her boutique along with a cautious Fluttershy, who was flying low to the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know,&quot; Twilight answered and then looked to her home, &quot;Pinkie Pie, if you destroy my library, I swear I will make you remember all those Eiken loops in perfect clarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think I broke it. I think I hit the autopilot,&quot; the party pony body-checked Rainbow Dash out of the way and then stuck her head out of the window. </p><p class="double">That was when Twilight&#039;s library tree started to lift off of the ground, roots and all.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy in the sky,&quot; Pinkie waved to the yellow pegasus as she sang, &quot;We can fly twice as high. Take a look, we&#039;re in a book.. library.&quot;</p><p class="double">The library tree started to gain altitude at a rapid rate.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re off on an adventure in spaaaaaaace!&quot; Pinkie&#039;s voice faded as Twilight&#039;s home left the atmosphere.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the empty sky for a minute with a blank expression on her face. Then she realized that without the elements of laughter and loyalty, she could not open the box and create her new home. She was a homeless pony. </p><p class="double">The lavender alicorn&#039;s horn glowed ominously as she slowly turned towards Tirek&#039;s unconscious form, &quot;This is all your fault.&quot; </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<br /><p class="double">105.1</p><p class="double">Fluttershy cleared her throat, making a tiny <i>ahem</i> noise. “Er... Mister Iron Will?”</p><p class="double">The Minotaur pointed at her. “Yes?”</p><p class="double">She fluttered her wings frantically, hovering slowly up so she could see better over the crowd. “I had a few questions.”</p><p class="double">“Go on,” Iron Will said, nodding.</p><p class="double">“Well... I was a little worried.” Fluttershy frowned. “When you&#039;re telling ponies how to be assertive... it sounded a lot like a way to turn them into bullies.”</p><p class="double">“Outrageous!” Iron Will replied. “I teach ponies how to stand up, not knock others down!”</p><p class="double">“I understand that.” Fluttershy raised a hoof, and made a tiny gesture, waggling it back and forth. “But the distinction&#039;s important, and I&#039;m not sure it has enough attention paid to it.”</p><p class="double">She expanded on the point. “So... if I walked into a restaurant, and I wanted to book a table, and they rudely said no... what should I do?”</p><p class="double">Iron Will slammed a hoof on the floor. “You should get in their face, so you can get a place!”</p><p class="double">“And sometimes, that would work.” Fluttershy nodded. “It&#039;s better than just not following up at all, perhaps. But what if they really <i>do</i> have no places left, and the staff were just rude because they were working so hard?”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “I think your style <i>is</i> important. I know I&#039;m not very assertive sometimes, goodness knows. But it only really works if the <i>other</i> pony isn&#039;t as assertive as you... and that means that it&#039;s sometimes just a big shouting match.”</p><p class="double">Iron Will frowned.</p><p class="double">“All I&#039;m saying is, I think you should pay attention to <i>when</i> to be assertive, and when <i>not</i> to be assertive,” Fluttershy continued. “You don&#039;t need to spend much time on it, just... make it clear that the distinction exists.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” The motivational speaker mulled that over, then nodded. “Thank you. I believe I will take your advice.”</p><p class="double">“Oh...” Fluttershy shrugged. “It was nothing, really...”</p><p class="double">She paused. “Oh, and that was just me being polite.” A smile spread over her face. “I don&#039;t need to be taught how to be assertive <i>there</i>, it&#039;d just be rude...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was interesting to hear,” Twilight observed.</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Fluttershy replied. “I think having all these instincts means that I pay attention to things like that. It wouldn&#039;t do any good to react like a pony would when another wolf comes bounding over, or like an eagle would when Angel Bunny bounces over...”</p><p class="double">“Foolishly try to attack and get pounded into tar?” Twilight suggested.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that&#039;s the one,” Fluttershy agreed earnestly. “And it&#039;s the same thing with mister Iron Will. He teaches an important lesson, but it&#039;s not the one some people need to learn, and it&#039;s certainly not the only thing you should apply. That just makes you... well...”</p><p class="double">Twilight eyed her. “Were you about to say Rainbow Dash?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blushed. “Maybe?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">A few seconds after the final scream, the seneschal slowly slid his snout around the doorframe and carefully observed the destroyed remnants of the room. His eyes slid to the slumped and haggard pink princess who sat utterly still in the middle of the wreckage.</p><p class="double">He cleared his throat. &quot;...you are... quite the polyglot, princess Cadenza.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance.&quot; The correction came automatically, wearily. &quot;Don&#039;t... bother asking me to translate, just... don&#039;t repeat any words you didn&#039;t understand.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, very well.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment of careful judgement, the seneschal stepped in and slowly made his way toward her. &quot;I take it this is why you asked if anything here was... irreplaceable?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Pretty much, yeah.&quot; Cadance shrugged hopelessly. &quot;It&#039;s just... love is my thing. Weddings are... I love weddings. But two of my close friends... the first one, they decided that they didn&#039;t want a wedding for, basically, political reasons and that&#039;s fine.&quot; She kicked at what had once been a chair leg. &quot;The second time, though... Discord is the spirit of chaos. Freaking. Chaos. And weddings are kind of permanent things. He is literally incapable of, of walking down the aisle and....&quot;</p><p class="double">She broke down crying. &quot;Spike and Rarity were beautiful! Are beautiful! Why doesn&#039;t anypony else marry in the loops?! Why just this... I&#039;m so happy but they won&#039;t make it official! It&#039;s just so, so frustrating and I&#039;m so torn, so torn, and....&quot;</p><p class="double">The seneschal, not at all knowing what she was talking about, backed away slowly. Perhaps it was best to find Prince Armor. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.3 (misterq)</p><p class="double">All the ponies came out to look at Twilight&#039;s ravaged library. Some were there to offer their support out of friendship or neighborly acquaintance. Others were just scared of Twilight and her spell, one that divested Tirek of all of his magic and launched him back to Tartarus in under a second. One pony, however, was practically bouncing with barely restrained energy.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up from where she was sitting on the cold ground while contemplating her poor house once again, &quot;I suppose that either you have a plan to cheer me up, Pinkie, or some pony has spontaneously gone insane and given you a cup of coffee.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Coffee?! Where?&quot; Pinkie shook her head rapidly and then cleared her throat, &quot;I mean, I&#039;m here to cheer you up, silly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Here&#039;s where I&#039;m supposed to ask how, correct?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup! And to answer your supposed question, I&#039;m supposed to remind you of that time me and Dashie and your library slash Jurian tree ship hybrid flew off into space.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I remember. Thanks for reminding me,&quot; Twilight Sparkle sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well after our space adventure, I patched up the tree ship and added a few extras, and then I had Apple Bloom do her thing and then I took it to Rarity so she could toughen it up, and then I went to Berry Punch&#039;s house and I don&#039;t remember most of the rest of that day for some reason, but here! This is for you,&quot; Pinkie shoved a small wrapped gift box at the lavender unicorn.</p><p class="double">Twilight cautiously unwrapped the box and opened the lid. A bright glowing light flew out and quickly expanded over her head. Suddenly, a floating duplicate of her library tree was hovering above the ruins of her destroyed one.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at her pink pony friend with happy tears in her eyes.</p><p class="double">Pinkie continued talking, &quot;It has all your books, plus copies of every unique book and media thingy we all had in our pockets. It&#039;s pretty much indestructible, can heal itself, and will shrink and fit in your pocket before a loop ends, even if you&#039;re asleep. It has that fast charging teleport jump drive your old ship had and can even exponentially grow to the size of Applejack&#039;s tree fortress ship and back to its regular size again. It&#039;s ageless and self repairing and will come when you call, and it&#039;s all yours! This way, you will have your home no matter where you are. They say home is where your heart is, but yours will always be in your pocket! And you&#039;ll never have to worry about losing it again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stood up and tackle-hugged Pinkie to the ground, &quot;Thank you! Thank you, thank you!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie just hugged back with a huge smile on her face. These were the moments she lived for.</p><p class="double">&quot;You want to take it for a spin, Twilight?&quot; Pinkie said, ignoring the cheering crowd.</p><p class="double">Twilight wiped the tears from her eyes and asked, &quot;Space party?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded enthusiastically, &quot;Space party! Who wants to come along?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;ll go!&quot; Applejack&#039;s hoof was up in the air. She had been wanting to take a break from the farm for a few loops now.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can I come?&quot; Ditzy asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure,&quot; Twilight waved her over.</p><p class="double">&quot;Take care of Dinky for me, Carrot Top,&quot; Ditzy told the tired looking orange maned pony next to her, &quot;I&#039;m going into space!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh!&quot; Pinkie hopped up with an idea, &quot;I can take my new ship. We can all take our spaceships and have a party fleet!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ll need a crew,&quot; Lyra came forward, &quot;And I&#039;m practically a crew all by myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure you can come, Lyra,&quot; the pink pony waved her over, &quot;Musical ponies are always welcome on my new &#039;Life of the Party 3&#039;!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Got room for a DJ?&quot; asked a white unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Always, Vinyl!&quot; Pinkie exclaimed and then tossed what looked like a tiny Frisbee into the air. It quickly expanded until a miniature city-sized saucer, as decorated and bedazzled by way of Pinkie Pie, provided shade for the entire town of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; Rainbow Dash flew up into the air, &quot;I&#039;m going to go get that space comfort travel suit that you made for me, Pinkie, and then I&#039;ll join you all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think Rarity and I will stick around this time,&quot; Spike said.</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded in agreement, &quot;Some pony has to make sure Ponyville doesn&#039;t fall apart.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you think, Angel bunny? You want to go up there again?&quot; Fluttershy asked.</p><p class="double">Angel simply hopped up, farther than any normal rabbit had any right to jump; and then transformed into a white crystalline star-shaped spaceship.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what this means, girls?&quot; Apple Bloom asked.</p><p class="double">Then she and her two Awake filly friends shouted at the same time, &quot;Cutie Mark Crusaders Space Explorers!&quot;</p><p class="double">And with some shaking of the ground, an unassuming hill on Sweet Apple Acres opened up like a metal flower to reveal an enormous floating red apple surrounded by a thin, narrow ring.</p><p class="double">The three princesses folded their wings as they landed in Ponyville. Then, they looked up and stared at the sight of so many spacecraft floating in the air. The ships were now slowly starting to ascend, departing the planet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Since when did so many ponies manage to acquire their very own spaceships? It is as though everywhere I now look, there is a pony with their own space going vessel,&quot; Princess Luna said and turned to face her sister, only to see that Celestia was now standing on a large floating surfboard.</p><p class="double">The white alicorn gave a shrug and an innocent looking smile, &quot;I&#039;ve had it fitted with a star drive and figured now would be a good time to test it out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna watched as her waving sister surfed up into the sky, &quot;Cadance, it is up to you to make sure the sun rises and sets.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the princess of the night immediately sent herself to the moon and started preparations.</p><p class="double">Cadance blinked at the weight of her new responsibilities and looked down at the assorted ponies who were now staring at the last remaining princess in Equestria. Then she asked a most logical question, &quot;What.. what just happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a cry of, &quot;I&#039;m late!&quot; overhead that was followed by a blue blur trailing a visible rainbow trail behind her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">On board the USS <i>Enterprise</i>, Captain Picard watched silently as a procession that included a floating tree, a pink flying saucer, a crystalline star, a red apple with a Saturn ring around it, an alicorn on a surfboard, the entire MOON, and a blue winged pony dressed as a giant pop-tart all left planetary orbit.</p><p class="double">There was a faint twitch in his eye as he stood up from his chair, walked over to the navigation station, turned off the viewscreen, and punched in a course back to the alpha quadrant.</p><p class="double">Right before he got onto the turbolift, he turned around to the stunned bridge crew and said, &quot;If anyone needs me, I&#039;ll be in ten forward, drinking Guinan&#039;s best cognac. That is all.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.4 (misterq)</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s okay, Twilight,&quot; Cadance told the princess who she used to foalsit. The pink alicorn had come sprinting back from where she had raced off to after they gazed upon Trixie&#039;s massive firework, &quot;I managed to stop Trixie and got a different pony to do the ending fireworks on short notice.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s good,&quot; said the lavender unicorn, right before a sudden thought struck her, &quot;Er, Cadance? Which pony did you get?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight noticeably paled. If there was ever a looping pony that could wield magic and technology deftly enough to outdo Trixie, it would be Pinkie Pie. Especially if doing so made other ponies happy; like say, with a fireworks display.</p><p class="double">&quot;We have to stop-&quot; Twilight raced forward, only to see that she was too late. The pink party pony jammed a tiny little firework into the ground, lit it, and then scampered off.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at Pinkie&#039;s creation. It was a small little rocket, the size of something any foal could buy at a common firework stall; much smaller than Trixie&#039;s oversized water squirt bottle invitation. Pinkie&#039;s minute firework shot up in the air and exploded with a faint popping sound and a few unimpressive sparks.</p><p class="double">Cadance looked up at the now darkened sky, then at the grumbling stadium crowd, and finally at Pinkie, &quot;Was that it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie just kept smiling as she put on a pair of sunglasses.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, birch!&quot; Twilight exclaimed, shutting her eyes and bracing herself to the ground with her magic. She had just realized that she was now standing far too close to ground zero.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; was all Cadance managed to get out before the secondary explosion painted the night sky a blinding shade of white. The shockwave tossed the screaming, flailing alicorn of love into the air and across the stadium while styling every pony&#039;s mane back.</p><p class="double">&quot;So awesome!&quot; Rainbow Dash exclaimed open mouthed from behind her own set of sunglasses.</p><p class="double">Next to her, Trixie just grumbled something about doing better next time. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.5 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double">&quot;Got the rebreather checked out?&quot;</p><p class="double">*squeak*</p><p class="double">&quot;Pressure enchantments stable?&quot;</p><p class="double">*squeak*</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you hungry? Thirsty?&quot;</p><p class="double">*squesqueak*</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s going to be hours before you land.&quot;</p><p class="double">*sque. squeak.*</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, then. I have compensated all our delta v. We are dropping out of orbit into free fall. You&#039;ll have to pick up the 1000 km/h horizontal from air friction to match speed with the surface. And don&#039;t drop your lead weights too late.&quot;</p><p class="double">*Squeeeaaak* was the long suffering reply.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, yeah, you&#039;re a badass. I still can&#039;t believe that this is your reaction to finding out about the loops. Well, then, good luck Squirrly.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that Rainbow gave the flying squirrel a little shove, making it the first non-Looper to ever sky-dive from beyond Lunar Orbit. Maaaple, she loved Tank to bits, but she really missed out in baseline. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.6 (AnonymousAsk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sat down at her desk. It wasn’t the first time she’d replaced Mayor Mare, but last time there’d only been one or two of the others Awake. This time, she was struggling to think of someone who <i>wasn’t</i> Awake, and that was obviously causing problems...</p><p class="double">“CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS WEATHER CONTROLLERS! YAY!” Twilight heard a group of fillies shout just outside her window. Then there came an ominous roll of thunder, followed by a deluge of rain that slowly shifted into a blizzard. Twilight sighed, as she pulled out a stack of forms from one of the cabinets behind her.</p><p class="double">She had just sat down when she heard another shout from outside “The Great and Powerful Trixie will show Ponyville her true power!” There was a loud explosion from outside, and the snow of the blizzard took on the shades of an aurora. Another pile of paperwork was added to the in tray.</p><p class="double">The blizzard finally began to die down, and Twilight opened her window. She hoped the sound of the rain would help soothe the headache she was beginning to develop. Unfortunately, she was greeted by a different sound.</p><p class="double">“You are all going to <b>love me!</b>” Fluttershy yelled, as she caused a stampede through the town, and two piles of paperwork appeared. Twilight rubbed her eyes, but she wasn’t mistaken. She looked outside, and saw that the rain was now climbing back into the clouds. However, the puddles weren’t getting smaller, and the rain was made of chocolate.</p><p class="double">“For the love of Elderflowers-” Twilight said, her eye twitching. “Did <i>everyone</i> book a stress relief loop or something?”</p><p class="double">Then she heard stone wheels out in the street. She leant her head out of the window, and her eyes widened.</p><p class="double">“Cupcakes are the best!” Pinkie said, as she aimed her Party Cannon down the street.</p><p class="double">“An’ Ah say it’s fritters!” Applejack shouted, aiming her own cannon down the street.</p><p class="double">Both fired at the same time, and the resulting explosion deafened Twilight briefly, and resulted in the pile of paperwork in Twilight’s in tray now taking over her entire desk. </p><p class="double">Then she noticed the cup of coffee on her desk begin to ripple. At first, it was only one or two, but each time it shook, it shook with more vigour. As her hearing slowly returned, she began to hear pounding footsteps, and a scream. Twilight’s shoulders slumped as she headed for the window again.</p><p class="double">Spike, looking like he did on a greed induced growth spurt, walked down Ponyville High Street. As he approached Sugarcube Corner, he leant down and gave off a terrifying roar, the sheer force of which caused Sugarcube Corner to collapse. In his tail, Rarity was still screaming, but was being drowned out by the other noises.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned back to her office. It was more paperwork now, than room. Her eyes began to twitch, and she snorted.</p><p class="double">“BUCK! THIS!” she shouted to no-one, bucked the desk for good measure, and teleported out of the room, before the paperwork began to spill out of the still open window.</p><p class="double">Rarity noticed this and looked up to her husband, who was still wrapped up in his role. She gave him the preassigned signal, and he transformed back to his usual size. He bit his lip when he noticed the result of what happened. He looked around as the other loopers all started to gather in town square, where the Town Hall staff were desperately trying to fight against the now never-ending flood of paperwork.</p><p class="double">“I think we may have done a tad too much...” Rarity surmised, and the others nodded in agreement. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.7 (Bardic Knowledge)</p><p class="double">Twilight opened her fridge to get a drink and jumped back. &quot;Gah! Trixie? What are you doing in my fridge?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie is unsure... She apologizes for the inconvenience.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie, I&#039;m trying to read. Get off my head.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie was outside a few moments ago. How did she get in here?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight glared into her shopping cart.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is getting inconvenient for both of us. Trixie has things she&#039;s trying to do.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Later, at Mac&#039;s bar...</p><p class="double">&quot;So, she just keeps showing up?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! Neither of us understand it, she just-&quot; Twilight leaned back from the bar as Trixie appeared again. She stared into space for a moment before she sidled off the bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;Better make another. This is looking to be a long Loop.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.8 </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why am I still wearing a blindfold?” Trixie asked, grumpily.</p><p class="double">“I tooooold you, I&#039;ve got a surpriiiiise,” Chrysalis reminded her.</p><p class="double">“At this point, I ponder if the surprise is a new loop,” Trixie said. “How much longer?”</p><p class="double">“Not long,” Chrysalis replied. The tone of her voice changed slightly as she walked, and Trixie dutifully followed behind. “Thanks for wearing that dress I picked out, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s only fair that the Great and Powerful Trixie not clash with her marefriend when she goes out to a meal,” Trixie replied. She frowned. “Or other unspecified event, of course. I am merely assuming that it is a meal.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sniggered. “Oh, you&#039;re going to be <i>so</i> surprised...” By now, her voice echoed slightly. It had an odd character to it, which Trixie couldn&#039;t quite interpret. As though they were in a large, but enclosed, space.</p><p class="double">“Stop there,” she added, and Trixie stopped. “Back two steps... there. Okay, you know how the Changelings are out in the open this loop?”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded. “Yeah, it was kind of hard to miss when you turned up at my show on the second day. Alongside Celestia and Luna.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis tapped a hoof on what sounded like thick carpet. “Yes, that was entertaining. Nice of you to treat it as a Royal Command Performance.”</p><p class="double">“As in, the royals command me to perform,” Trixie completed the tired formula. “Seriously, what&#039;s the surprise?”</p><p class="double">“Well.” Chrysalis ruffled some paper. Faint music started to play. “I had Ivory look this over – it&#039;s valid. This loop, noble consorts are considered of equal rank to the one with whom they consort, regardless of marital status.”</p><p class="double">“...I see,” Trixie said, in the tones of one slowly understanding. “Which means-”</p><p class="double">The blindfold fell away, neatly sliced through.</p><p class="double">Eight thousand changelings burst into song in unison.</p><p class="double"><i>Twilight the Priest, and Chrysalis the Queen anointed Trixie Queen,</p><p class="double">And all the Changelings rejoiced and said,</p><p class="double">Long Live the Queen-</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis sniggered. “The crown looks good on you. I had them make a blue version of mine. Identical except for the highlighting.”</p><p class="double">“<i>What,</i>” Trixie repeated.</p><p class="double">“Sweetie wrote it,” Twilight volunteered. “Called it Twilight the Priest, which I complained about because I&#039;m female, but she said it&#039;d spoil the meter-”</p><p class="double">“What?” Trixie turned to her oldest friend. “What?”</p><p class="double">“It was a coronation hymn,” Chrysalis volunteered. “An interpretation of – what was it?”</p><p class="double">“Zadok the Priest,” Twilight filled in. “I liked it when I heard it, but none of us have a coronation which is worth anything for it. It doesn&#039;t work for &#039;Princess&#039; as a title...”</p><p class="double">“...what?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis glanced over at Twilight. “Haven&#039;t we answered everything?”</p><p class="double">Twilight tapped her chin. “...ah! I know what it is.” She moved in a little closer to Trixie. “We just pranked you with an eight-thousand-voice choral version of a coronation hymn. Also you&#039;re now officially co-Queen of the Changelings.”</p><p class="double">Trixie nodded, surprisingly calmly. “Why?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis&#039; voice softened. “Because it&#039;s the first chance I&#039;ve had to make this point. I... am by now quite sure that I love you, Trixie Lulamoon. I wanted to show that, and I wanted to do it in a way that was really very impressive.”</p><p class="double">She shrugged, a smile playing over her lips. “And this was the best I could get without Cadence lynching us both next time she loops.”</p><p class="double">Trixie parsed that sentence. When she next spoke, her voice was a little husky. “You mean-”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d marry you if it was what we wanted,” Chrysalis said simply. “<i>I</i> still don&#039;t, but if I thought it&#039;d make you happy I&#039;d ignore that.”</p><p class="double">“No, I&#039;m fine without getting married,” Trixie said quickly. “I... gods, this is going to take a moment-”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis stepped up. “You don&#039;t have to say anything, Trix.” She nuzzled Trixie gently along the cheek. “I know what you&#039;re thinking.”</p><p class="double">“Then you know how much-” Trixie swallowed. “How much that means to me.”</p><p class="double">The matriarch of a race that fed on love embraced the stage magician who&#039;d begun as a drifter, and no further words were spoken for several minutes.</p><p class="double">“Of-” Trixie&#039;s voice broke. She stopped, worked her mouth for a moment, and started again. “You realize that that coronation had <i>far</i> too few fireworks.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis smiled. “Of course I do. That&#039;s why I booked us both a week&#039;s holiday on the Antequestrian Islands. Take all the explosives you want, we&#039;ll be the only people within a thousand miles of the blast radius.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent,” Trixie pronounced, with a grin. She kissed Chrysalis quickly on the neck. “You always remember.”</p><p class="double">She then looked around, and frowned. “Twilight? You&#039;re awfully-”</p><p class="double">Twilight fell over, revealing that there was a cardboard cutout in place of the unicorn. A note was taped to the back.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis picked it up, read it quickly, and sniggered.</p><p class="double">“What?” Trixie asked.</p><p class="double">Her co-ruler passed it over. “Still the same Twilight.”</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;ll leave you two to it.</p><p class="double">Seriously, I was standing </i>right there!<i> I&#039;m happy for you, but – come on!</p><p class="double">- Twilight.</p><p class="double">P.S. I recommend Courant Island. It&#039;s got a nice beach, twenty acres of prime grass, and a large patch of recent basalt to use as a launch pad.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.9 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Twilight hummed a little musical number she had long ago forgotten the name of as she trotted up the trail to Fluttershy&#039;s house. Pausing to knock on the door, she couldn&#039;t help but once again wonder what her shy friend was getting up to.</p><p class="double">As expected, Fluttershy answered the door.</p><p class="double">Rather less expected was the enthusiasm the act was performed with, as well as the white lab coat and boxy goggles Fluttershy was wearing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Twilight! Please, come in! I was just about to put on some tea.&quot; she smiled, beckoning the lavender unicorn inside.</p><p class="double">As she entered, Twilight noticed several things that were not there previously. For starters, a computer had been set up. In addition to that, bits of metal and half assembled machinery were scattered about, and she was fairly sure that the doctorate certificate on the wall was brand new. &quot;Fluttershy? What&#039;s going on? You said you had big plans for this loop, and then you just kind of vanished.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blushed. &quot;Oh, did I? Sorry. I didn&#039;t mean to. It&#039;s just that things are going so well, and I&#039;m having so much fun!&quot; she giggled. &quot;I went back to school. You can call me Doctor Fluttershy now! Um, you know, unless you would rather call me something else.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight couldn&#039;t help but grin. &quot;Well, look at you! First your encyclopedia, and now this! What brought on the quest for knowledge, if I may ask?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled, but shook her head. &quot;Purely a side effect. I visited a very interesting loop, and decided I wanted to try my own spin on it, so I went and got a PHD,&quot; she grinned, gesturing to her diploma with pride. &quot;in adorableness!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s response was as eloquent as anyone would expect from her.</p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well I kind of had to. I couldn&#039;t have opened the right kind of website without it.&quot; Fluttershy shrugged, walking Twilight over to her computer. &quot;I&#039;m trying to be as close to the source material as I can, while still being myself. And really, I think it&#039;s been good for me! I can talk to ponies over social media much easier than I can face to face. It&#039;s the first truly big step to overcoming my social anxiety!&quot; she beamed. &quot;I&#039;m still not ready to sing for so many yet though, so I&#039;m just doing questions for now. Take a look and tell me what you think!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nudged the mouse to disable the screen saver. A moment later, she had to ascend, just so she could facehoof with both forelegs, and both wings. Nothing else would have been an adequate response</p><p class="double">&quot;Doctor Adorable&#039;s Ask Along Blog. 145,000 followers.&quot; she groaned, while Fluttershy hid her mirth at Twilight&#039;s reaction behind a hoof. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After indulging Fluttershy in her blogging adventures for the day, Twilight left her to her &#039;adorable evil plans&#039; and went out to check on Applejack. Pinkie had informed her earlier that Applejack was rapidly approaching the looper version of a midlife crisis.</p><p class="double">Upon arriving at the farm, Mac met her at the gate. &quot;Glad ta&#039; see ya&#039; Miss Twilight.&quot; he nodded, shifting the stalk of hay in his mouth slightly. &quot;Poor sis seemed to realize that compared to the rest of y&#039;all, she don&#039;t really have that much to define her as a looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned. &quot;How bad?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac shrugged. &quot;Well, nothin&#039; too destructive yet. She&#039;s mostly been tryin&#039; old power &#039;n skill sets she don&#039;t use too often ta&#039; see if she can think of a way ta&#039; make &#039;em her own. A few actually seem ta&#039; be appealin&#039; to her.&quot; He then paused, thought for a moment, then chuckled. &quot;Heh, appealin&#039;. Apple peels. I gotta remember that one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight let him get it out of her system before she got him back on track. &quot;So... what skill sets is she still deciding on?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac coughed. &quot;Well, believe it or not, ah think her time as Rarity durin&#039; that whole cutie mark swap thing may have left an imprint on her. She mostly seems ta&#039; be workin&#039; with the artsy stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Really? Applejack? Not that I&#039;m criticizing her or anything, because that&#039;s great but... I didn&#039;t take her as the kind to pick art as a hobby. I figured she would start with apple stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac grinned, cleared his throat, and recited in his best Applejack impression. &quot;Ah believe she said somethin&#039; along the lines of, &#039;Aw, what do you know big brother! I can draw ALL of them apples!&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned and waited for Mac to get over his case of the giggles again. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight wandered through Sweet Apple Acres looking for Applejack. She had already run into Granny Smith, who had informed her that Applejack had been with her in the kitchen earlier, and managed to trap Twilight for a good fifteen rambling minutes as she told her how proud she was that Applejack was finally taking the time to learn the Apple family Great Cooking Secrets, before wandering off on a tangent involving her early years and a sass-squash.</p><p class="double">After finally managing to find a way to escape without hurting Granny Smith&#039;s feelings, Twilight ran into Apple Bloom, who informed her that Applejack had also been to see her, but swiftly lost interest when discovering that Apple computers were already a thing, though she did ask a few questions on stasis fields for some reason.</p><p class="double">Several long hours of searching later, she finally found Applejack on the edge of the zap apple orchard. She had a half dozen shadow clones out, and all of them were hard at work doing... something. Upon spotting Twilight, one of them ran over, skidding to a stop mere inches from Twilight&#039;s face with a frazzled mane, wide eyes, and a somewhat maniacal grin. &quot;Twilight! Glad &#039;yer here! Ah finally found it! Ah know what ma&#039; place in the loops is!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight slowly backed away to a more comfortable distance. &quot;That&#039;s... great, Applejack!&quot; She grinned awkwardly, getting Apple Bucking Day flashbacks. &quot;Mind sharing how you found it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack slid a foreleg around Twilight and yanked her close, side to side, holding her other hoof in the air. &quot;Okay, picture this! Ah never really found somethin&#039; that really spoke ta&#039; me. Spike has the whole Jedi thing, Pinkie&#039;s got them Chaos God powers, Flutters is a Druid, an&#039; so on. Well that got me thinkin&#039; about ma&#039; place in the group, an&#039; ah decided ta&#039; find somethin&#039; of ma&#039; own.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight slowly nodded. &quot;Easy enough, you&#039;re the dependable one. The one who takes the jobs that we need done no matter what, because you&#039;ll GET them done no matter what.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly Applejack was in Twilight&#039;s face again. &quot;Exactly! Ah&#039;m the support! The one who holds the group together with common sense and a dash a&#039; hindsight! So ah got to comparin&#039; us to the loops. An&#039; ya know what supports the loops?!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a lengthy pause. Eventually Twilight came to the conclusion that Applejack wasn&#039;t going to continue until she guessed. &quot;Um... the Admins?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shook her head. &quot;No, it&#039;s other loops! We all have skills and memories that make us who we are today, an&#039; we wouldn&#039;t have them if it weren&#039;t for tha loops that came before! The PAST supports the loops Twilight, and ah&#039;m gonna make sure we never forget it, an&#039; that any guest loopers can remember it too! Ah&#039;m start&#039;n a loop museum, complete with gift shop!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;A museum? A gift shop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. &quot;Yep, that road trip with Pinkie reminded me that the Apple family has a tradition with keepin&#039; history. Ah got a couple shadow clones on sewin&#039; machines making these little guys!&quot; she grinned, handing two objects to Twilight.</p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head at the cloth dolls of herself and Applejack. &quot;Plushies?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. &quot;We&#039;ll sure, why not? Any guest loopers can take home a momento, an ah can make plushies of the guests for us an&#039; for the museum! Now ah know what yer thinkin&#039;, and no, the museum ain&#039;t gonna&#039; be nothing but plushies, ah&#039;ll have some proper historical stuff too. Ah got some clones earthbendin&#039; some sculptures fer a special exhibit Pinkie Pie requested. Come on down an&#039; have a look.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seeing no way out of it, and honestly being a touch curious, Twilight followed as Applejack led her over.</p><p class="double">And then she froze.</p><p class="double">And started to twitch.</p><p class="double">There before her, Applejack&#039;s clones were hard at work making models of her library. All to scale, all heavily detailed, and all in the process of being destroyed in one way or another, be it exploding, being crushed, being blasted, being abducted, or otherwise.</p><p class="double">Applejack just shrugged. &quot;She wanted ta&#039; know how many ways it could be done, so ah&#039;m keepin&#039; a record for her in a side wing.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.10 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia was having a good morning.</p><p class="double">Not the best. That was reserved for when it was scheduled to be cloudy in the east, so nopony would notice if she slept in and delayed the rising of the sun for an extra hour or so.</p><p class="double">But it was still a good morning. The birds were singing, the nobles were presently arguing over something far too petty to justify bringing to her, and she was having pancakes.</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia really thought of herself as more of the Alicorn of the Dawn then the Alicorn of the Day. She rose the sun, and it traveled the sky on its own, until it stopped at the horizon, and Luna set it so her moon may emerge.</p><p class="double">And as Alicorn of the Dawn, she had also long ago privately declared herself to be the Alicorn of Breakfast. The only downside was that by her own logic, Luna had declared herself the Alicorn of Dessert. Which seemed rather unfair to Celestia.</p><p class="double">Somehow.</p><p class="double">But as much as she loved cake and pastry (lately she had been in a cherry danish mood rather than cake, to be honest), pancakes were a glorious second place.</p><p class="double">So it was with great pleasure that she pranced into the royal breakfast hall (and then swore her guards to secrecy, yet again), slid into her plush seat, and greeted Luna, herself enjoying a bowl of Cherri-oats before bed.</p><p class="double">And it was with great anticipation that she gazed lovingly at her eleven inch stack of warm buttermilk goodness, levitated her fork, syrup, a dab of butter, and her napkin before her, and prepared to dig in.</p><p class="double">And it was with a touch of confusion that she witnessed the pancake on the very top of the stack vanish.</p><p class="double">&quot;... Luna, why are you giggling?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna, presently Awake, though tired, was attempting very hard to conceal her mirth, and failing. Though to her credit she was doing very well for having been halfway through a mouthful of juice when she started.</p><p class="double">&quot;O-our apologies sister. T&#039;would seem our friend is hungry as well.&quot; she snickered behind a silver-shod hoof, trying not to lose it completely at her sister&#039;s confusion.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, hidden from Celestia on the opposite side of the pancake tower, the presently possum shaped James T. Kirk, A.K.A. Tiberius, or Tibbers to Luna, was nibbling away at his ill gotten goods, happy to have yet again done something to get Luna to smile. He couldn&#039;t help it, he just had a weakness for blue females.</p><p class="double">Though honestly, with the number of times he had been the guest anchor like this, he had figured someone would have figured out it was him by now. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.11 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle pouted as Fluttershy drank her victory glass. &quot;I still don&#039;t think your trains were better than my sister fighting a crab.&quot; she muttered.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis rolled her eyes. &quot;Face it kid, if I lost that one, you were going to lose as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gently placing the empty glass back on the table, Fluttershy pondered the subject for the next round. &quot;Um, let&#039;s see... I know! What was the most unusual thing you ever did that got an un-awake Twilight to go a bit neurotic?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked. &quot;I looped as a voice in the head of my un-awake self. I told her the fate of Equestria depended on her kissing Rainbow Dash when we first met.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash had the misfortune to be leaning back in her chair at the time, and crashed to the floor. &quot;AARGH! What the- Not cool Sparkle! Not cool!&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo just folded her forelegs and huffed. &quot;Darn lucky purple unicorn...&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash pulled her chair upright and sat back down. &quot;Okay, you wanna&#039; go big this round? We can go big. Remember that Undefeated Alicorn Racing Circuit prank of yours? To get back at you, I &#039;accidentally&#039; switched bodies with you the day of the Best Young Flyers competition.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. &quot;Okay, okay, point taken.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity shrugged. &quot;I went around solving all her friendship problems before she even discovered them. It was the Smarty Pants incident all over again, to the tenth power. A mere two years without having a letter to send the princess, and she somehow had Philomena on the throne and had tried to release Discord on the condition he stir up trouble, whereupon he refused and turned himself back into a statue.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack smirked. &quot;Weekly poker games, and I never once bluffed. She never caught on.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. &quot;I got a heartsong stuck in her head. The nearly hourly musical numbers she had to perform kept her from sleeping for three days!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and thumped her head down on the table. &quot;My best friends, fillies and gentlecolts.&quot; she groaned.</p><p class="double">Vinyl grinned, absently bobbing her head to her tunes through her earbuds. &quot;Why do you think I turned the Chicken Dance into a heartsong?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis pondered a bit. &quot;Well... there was that one time I turned into a female version of her brother, and signed us up for the Sisterhooves Social, and only told her an hour beforehand.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie cackled. &quot;Ah, twas so long ago! Trixie had just discovered how to make thermite-&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda flinched. &quot;Quickly changing the subject-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! Trixie wasn&#039;t finished!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;-there was the time I kept breaking into the library and rearranging all the furniture and bookshelves in the middle of the night.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle blinked. &quot;Really? I thought I was the only one who did that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy smiled. &quot;I looped in as Pinkie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac passed her the drink. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.12 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks fer comin&#039; by, Fluttershy. I wanna ask ya a favor, but I think you should get an idea of what I&#039;m plannin&#039; first,&quot; said Applejack as she led the pegasus into a mostly-empty wing of her museum.</p><p class="double">&quot;I figger I&#039;ll call it the &#039;Hall of Ascension&#039; or somethin&#039; like that when it&#039;s done,&quot; explained the self-appointed curator.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy looked at an array of display areas. Many were empty, save for the cutie-mark of a pony that had Ascended at some point during the Loops.</p><p class="double">There were some exhibits in varying stages of readiness, including:</p><p class="double">A scale replica of Rainbow Dash&#039;s mach 70 impact crater.</p><p class="double">&#039;Before&#039; and &#039;After&#039; images of Tatooine&#039;s terraforming as taken from orbit, along with an apple. The helpful sign indicated that it was from the first apple tree germinated in the Dune Sea and asked that visitors not disrupt the stasis spell.</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s Alicorn-feather dress, with a note indicating it was on loan from the unicorn&#039;s private collection. &quot;Rarity said she wanted to switch which dress was on display every fifty loops or so,&quot; explained Applejack.</p><p class="double">A battered set of pony armor accompanying the image of an exhausted, newly-ascended Trixie.</p><p class="double">A replica of a stained glass window depicting Scootaloo&#039;s rescue of Cloudsdale. The cutie mark on the display was the one the orange filly had earned from the feat.</p><p class="double">The &#039;File Copy&#039; of the Contractor Compliance Form that was the core of Ivory Scroll&#039;s campaign against the Vogons. (Also protected against the ravages of time with a stasis spell.)</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m workin&#039; on collectin&#039; items from all of us what done Ascended outside the baseline. I kin get pictures and replicas with Twilight&#039;s memory-to-image spell, but it&#039;d be extra nice with actual objects related to the Ascensions. I don&#039;t suppose y&#039;all have photos of the wedding when ya brought Chrys and her swarm as guests?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think so, but I&#039;ll have to search through my pocket. Can I get back to you later?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure. Also, I&#039;ve been tryin&#039; to think of what I could ask Pinkie, Sweetie Belle, and Ditzy to contribute and keep comin&#039; up blank. Y&#039;all have any ideas?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie may have a few leftover &#039;Warp Party&#039; invitations...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.13 (LordCirce) – Applejack&#039;s second run</p><p class="double">The party faced the doors. Gandalf had stopped Pippin from knocking the skeleton down the hole, only for Merry to step on a stray helmet and end up kicking it across the room. Soon enough, the goblins with their troll were pounding on the door.</p><p class="double">Gimli tensed, holding his axe, while next to him, Applejack seemed to dance in place. Only Aragorn and Gandalf noticed that several loud thuds echoed from outside of the door in time with her hoofbeats. Finally, she raised herself up slightly before stomping down with both of her front legs. Outside, a tremendous thud shook the room, then silence. Sam hurried over to her side, while Aragorn and Gimli approached the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;Easy, girl, Master Aragorn and Master Gimli will take care of it. Don&#039;t worry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;m not worried, sugarcube.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Comforting nicker?&quot;</p><p class="double">Aragorn peered around the door that they had managed to pry open. &quot;Well, it looks like they, ah, knocked themselves out on the door.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gimli laughed. &quot;Ha. That&#039;s Dwarven engineering for ya. Even Dwarf doors will take out goblins by the cartful.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack rolled her eyes at Sam, who blinked owlishly at her. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.14 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double">Twilight wandered over to the edge of the Everfree. Several ponies in town had been complaining about banging and whirring noises coming from the forest, so Twilight figured Applebloom had probably gotten a little overenthusiastic, and forgotten the soundproofing on her lab.</p><p class="double">The sight that greeted her at the edge of the woods was not, in fact, Applebloom. Instead, Cheerilee was humming away as she worked on constructing some form of spaceship. She was pulling capsules out of her Pocket, which then expanded into parts and components, which she then slotted into place in her ship.</p><p class="double">&quot;Planning a outer space field trip?&quot; Twilight asked, smiling.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee smiled brightly. &quot;Something like that. I just figured it is best to be prepared.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. Something was just a bit off about Cheerilee&#039;s smile. &quot;Prepared? For what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee held up a hoof. &quot;For two reasons. One, Dinky and Derpy have switched places this Loop. Two, Derpy doesn&#039;t have a cutie mark yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight mulled that over. &#039;So, Derpy is a foal, and has no cutie mark, which equals...&#039;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee smiled as recognition of the situation stole across Twilight&#039;s face. &quot;So, as an Unawake Derpy is the apparent ringleader of an Unawake CMC this Loop, I figured that having a way off the planet if necessary is a prudent choice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Yeah. I ... I think I am going to go find Discord and practice my long-range teleportation through extreme Chaos Magic fields.&quot; And with a final shudder, she vanished with a small pop. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.15 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">The doors burst open, startling a few of the palace staffponies, and Cadance twirled out with a happy grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens!&quot; she sang as she pirouetted about. &quot;Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens!&quot; One unwary maid was suddenly snatched up and spun about. &quot;Silver white winters that melt into spring!&quot; With a final nuzzle, Cadance put her blushing victim down, cantering down the hall. &quot;These are a few of my favourite things!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor leaned against a nearby archway, a small smirk on his face. &quot;Sounds like somepony had a fun loop,&quot; he quipped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Shine-shine it was just beautiful!&quot; The pretty pink pony princess pulled her paramour into a pinioned hug. &quot;Picture this: <i>Balinor.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...never heard of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s an obscure loop, I grant you. No pegasi, only horses and unicorns.&quot; She stuck out her tongue in mock annoyance. &quot;Bleh.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining chuckled. &quot;Still, it sounds like a nice place.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, Arianna said it was usually a tad more dangerous, and she <i>is</i> the local anchor.&quot; Cadance&#039;s smile broadened. &quot;But this loop, Sleipnir and Epona stepped in to take care of the shifter and <i>I got to be the best mare!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">The captain of the guard blinked a bit. &quot;Sleipnir and Epona. As in, the admins?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, localized avatars but really what&#039;s the difference?&quot; The princess of love sighed happily. &quot;The groom was so handsome in his wedding armor and the bride... oh, I never knew a kilt and tattoos could be made to look so beautiful!&quot; She perked up suddenly. &quot;Shining, I just had this idea. When we get married this loop, our families should have some form of ritual combat.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trust me, it was very sweet.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.16(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">Twilight walked into Mac&#039;s Bar, and noticed Sunset chatting with Sky Catcher. Twilight sat down, and said, &quot;Hello, Sky Catcher. What are you and Sunset chatting about?&quot;</p><p class="double">In her monotone style, Sky Catcher replied, &quot;I was letting miss Shimmer know how John Connor is taking the Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s nice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset started counting, and three seconds later, Twilight said, &quot;Wait...John Connor&#039;s Awake? When did that happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset answered this. &quot;When I Looped into miss SkyNet&#039;s home Loop during my journey back to Equestria. And no matter what you say SkyNet, I&#039;m calling you a girl.&quot; Grabbing her drink, Sunset began her story.</p><p class="double"><i>When I Awoke in that Loop, I was in the role of one Sarah Connor. I&#039;d heard other Looper&#039;s opinions on SkyNet Awakening, and many are still unsure about her being redeemed. In my opinion, you did the impossible, Twilight.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Anyhow, I decided to give that Loop a bit of a technological Renaissance. By the time SkyNet Awoke in the Terminator sent to protect John from the T-1000, technology was a decade ahead. I was smart enough not to do what Sarah did that got her in the nuthouse.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Anyhow, SkyNet figured I was a Looper within five minutes of our meeting, but didn&#039;t know which one I was. After I told her my tale, she was curious as to what someone like me could do. During our spar, John walked in.</i></p><p class="double"><i>He Awoke at that moment.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Boy, was explaining the Loops difficult. ESPECIALLY since it was SkyNet being the Anchor for his world. After that explanation, SkyNet took care of the T-1000 easily, and set up some protocols to try and prevent her other self from going haywire.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Interesting Loop. </i></p><p class="double">Twilight looked impressed. &quot;That must&#039;ve been a tough one for the both of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sky Net dryly responded, &quot;Wasn&#039;t made easier by miss Shimmer joking a lot when I told her about my meeting with Blues.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shimmer smirked. &quot;Sounded like you had a crush to me.&quot; Both her and Twilight chuckled, while Sky Net groaned. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.17 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight glared menacingly at the two cowering ponies before her. &quot;You two are just too much! What on earth made you think that it was a good idea to deal with things like that?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo tried not to flinch, they really did. &quot;But... Twilight, come on! Others do it all the time!&quot; Scootaloo insisted. &quot;Lara Croft, Nathan Drake-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut her off with a stomp. &quot;You want to be like them, you go be adventurers, not archeologists! They wouldn&#039;t know historical site preservation if you declared their own homes the site of their next dig!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash stepped between them. &quot;Now wait a minute! We can keep a site intact just as well as you can! Name ONE time before this loop that we-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your VERY FIRST expedition you blew a door open with a seismic charge! One designed for venting pressure in volcanoes! I checked that door myself the next loop you know. There was a sign on it. You know what it said?&quot; Twilight growled.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo cautiously shook their heads.</p><p class="double">&quot;It said &#039;Push To Open&#039;!!! Seriously, I doubt even Trixie could do more damage than you two while exploring!&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo winced. &quot;But that... We aren&#039;t THAT bad.&quot; she muttered looking down at her hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have no choice. You know what comes next.&quot; Twilight huffed, marching up to the two and holding a hoof out. &quot;Fork &#039;em over.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash paled. &quot;But... but those are-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now!&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, they both reluctantly removed their fedoras and gave them to her.</p><p class="double">&quot;AND the pith helmets!&quot;</p><p class="double">The headgear was hesitantly removed from their saddlebags and likewise surrendered.</p><p class="double">Twilight tossed them in her pocket. &quot;You can have these back when you show that you&#039;ve earned them. When you can pass a copy of the Advanced Archeology Midterm test, you&#039;ll get the helmets, but the fedoras are forbidden until you can pass the finals! This is for your own good! Now get to studying!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two slunk off. Rainbow Dash shaking her head. &quot;Man, is it just me, or is Twilight taking this a bit out of proportion? It&#039;s not like it was anything cool that was destroyed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo huffed. &quot;I know, right? We were just exploring the caves under Canterlot. It&#039;s not like the ENTIRE city caved in.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.18 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer Woke up running through a forest, fleeing from a manticore. There was something odd about this situation, beyond the feeling that this was somehow cliché. At any rate, a simple use of the Force to calm the beast, and she continued at a more sedate pace.</p><p class="double">Adjusting her course slightly, towards the slightly less dense forest, Sunset eventually jogged out of the woods and into the open fields beyond. Pausing at the woods&#039; edge, she put her hands on her hips and took in the view.</p><p class="double">The familiar view. She blinked, looking at the town, before pulling a pair of binoculars out to look closer.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m a human.&quot; Sunset lowered the binoculars. &quot;In Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Elsewhere along the forests&#039; rim, a certain yellow pegasus was going about her day. Starting slightly at the distant sound, Fluttershy considered for a moment, before deciding that an exasperated cry of &quot;Oh, come on!&quot; probably wasn&#039;t in distress. Possibly. Maybe. Perhaps she should get Applejack.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was Zecora&#039;s first trip to the farmer&#039;s market, after being introduced to the town, and Twilight was joining her to make sure there weren&#039;t any problems, and help introduce her to some of the vendors.</p><p class="double">Twilight stood back a ways, while Zecora sorted and haggled her way through the veggies section. Rainbow Dash chose this time to land beside her. &quot;I need you to help fake an accident that turns me into something not-a-pegasus.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good morning to you too, Dash,&quot; she replied, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Why do you need to lose the wings?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You remember that time we found out Oerth pegasi lay eggs?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooooh.&quot; Twilight&#039;s eyes widened in understanding. Their conversation was interrupted, as the crowd started murmuring in a way that would eventually end in a certain flowerpony panicking.</p><p class="double">Given as Zecora had been the center of attention this morning, most the market didn&#039;t notice the other oddity approaching until it was almost upon them. As dozens of ponies stopped and stared at the strange thing jogging through them, it was perhaps less than a surprise that it came to a stop in front of Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been looking for you. Got something I&#039;m supposed to deliver, your hooves only.&quot; What Twilight and Rainbow Dash recognized as Sunset Shimmer&#039;s human form held out a letter to Twilight. After Twilight took the letter, Sunset gave a nod, and said. &quot;Looks like that&#039;s it. Got to go.&quot;</p><p class="double">As they joined the crowd in watching Sunset jog down the street, before turning a corner and leaving sight, Twilight commented to her friend. &quot;She&#039;s Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I noticed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, that&#039;s what the letter says.&quot; Twilight held her paper so Rainbow Dash could see.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset was holding in her laughter until she had made a few turns, to hopefully throw off anypony following her. This plan came to an abrupt end when Bulk Biceps landed in her path. She noticed he was wearing the bright blue coat and cap of the Equestrian Mail Service. Similarly dressed, Ditzy Doo flew above him. The sound of paper ruffling made her look behind her, to see an earth pony, again wearing a Mail Service uniform, apparently wielding a fan of change-of-address forms; since this was Equestria, the origami cutie mark meant this was actually threatening.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Equestrian Mail Service don&#039;t like it when other folks deliver letters in their town.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three days later, Sunset was telling her story to Twilight, as they walked along her mail route. &quot;So since I wasn&#039;t a resident, or even legally in the country, they pulled some strings. I&#039;m up for discharge in two years, but I&#039;ll legally be an Equestrian citizen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh, didn&#039;t know the Mail Service was part of the military this loop.&quot; Twilight pondered. &quot;Wait, what about Spike? They&#039;ve never given me trouble about his letters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s easy,&quot; Sunset replied, sorting out the next batch of letters from her mailbag. &quot;Legally, he&#039;s part of the castle mail system. Your letters are considered &#039;internal&#039; memos.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">105.19 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Reed Richards sat on the roof of the Baxter Building, stretching his hand. Even after a few years of helping humanity, his incredible, impossible elasticity still marvelled him.</p><p class="double">Part of him wanted to channel or reproduce the cosmic radiation to give these incredible powers to everyone. Another was cautious, having seen what some did with such might. A third thought of Ben and the potential heartbreak that could come from the treatment. And a final part reminded him that just because none of the Fantastic Four had developed lethal tumours didn&#039;t mean that those cosmic rays were completely safe.</p><p class="double">A scream from the heavens shocked him out of his reflection. &quot;RICHARDS!&quot;</p><p class="double">Reed looked up, seeing an approaching dot. Memories came to mind: State University. A calculation error. A rebuffed correction. An explosion. An expulsion. &quot;Oh no.&quot; He clenched his fists. &quot;Not her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HIIIIII!&quot;</p><p class="double">Reed hesitated. He wasn&#039;t sure what to expect from Doom, but a friendly greeting wasn&#039;t it. Neither was her crashing belly-first into the roof, but she did that too.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oof.&quot; She looked up and gave a much more nervous smile than he thought she&#039;d be capable of. &quot;Well, that&#039;s why we wear kinetic dampeners when testing teleporters.&quot;</p><p class="double">Reed shook himself, taking in the figure before him. Doom was wearing what seemed to be an armoured flight suit. Her face was… &quot;Your scars.&quot;</p><p class="double">Doom&#039;s smile became happier as she pushed herself to her feet. &quot;Isn&#039;t plastic surgery amazing?&quot; She dusted herself off and approached him, pausing as she noticed his tension. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, Reed. I&#039;m not here for a fight or revenge or anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are you here then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To apologize.&quot;</p><p class="double">Reed was speechless for the better part of a minute. Finally, he sputtered out a &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Doom sighed. &quot;I was a jerk in college. You were just trying to help, but I couldn&#039;t handle the idea that I wasn&#039;t the smartest person on the planet. So I lashed out and took an explosion to my face for my troubles. Yeah, I was under a lot of stress, next in line for the throne and all, but that&#039;s not an excuse. Getting expelled really made me take a look at myself, and I didn&#039;t like what I saw.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So you invented teleportation and sent yourself a quarter of the way across the planet just to apologize?&quot; Reed shook his head. &quot;Who are you, and what have you done with Desiderata von Doom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I prefer Ditzy nowadays. My advisors say &#039;Queen Derpy of Latveria&#039; doesn&#039;t send the right message.&quot; &quot;Ditzy&quot; shrugged. &quot;Go figure.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It just feels rather absurd.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy smirked. &quot;Says the man made of living rubber.&quot;</p><p class="double">Reed chuckled. &quot;Touché. And I certainly accept your apology, Des— Ditzy.&quot; The two shook hands. &quot;I just wish we could&#039;ve been friends without what happened to you at SU.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, better late than never.&quot; Ditzy backed away. &quot;If you&#039;ll excuse me, I need to get back.&quot; Grey ghostly wings flared open on her back, then enveloped her. There was a blinding flash of light, and when Reed looked back, she was gone.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Later tonight, we ask our panel if Latveria can maintain its staggering economic growth. But first: Mutants. Six more reasons why you should be afraid.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(KrisOverstreet)</p><p class="double">Big orange hands parted slightly, and a bag full of mangled android parts poured its contents onto the stone floor of Castle Doom.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now lookit, Derpy,&quot; the Thing rumbled, &quot;we&#039;ve had this talk before, see? Quit buildin&#039; these robot doubles of yourself! They always try ta conquer th&#039; world, an&#039; we gotta go smash &#039;em up, an&#039; WE get blamed for all the damage!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m so sorry, Ben, Reed,&quot; Queen Ditzy Doom nodded her head to the two Fantastic Four members before her. &quot;But I always worry. What happens to my people if something happens to me? Latveria&#039;s surrounded by larger countries ruled by some really nasty people, you know. So I have to try to make sure there&#039;s somebody who can keep my people safe after I&#039;m gone!&quot;</p><p class="double">Doom stood from her throne and walked over to the pile of trashed android. The head was mostly intact, the blonde hair more rumpled than usual, the benevolent cross-eyed face forever frozen in a scowl of pure evil. &quot;This time I thought I had it, I really did,&quot; she said. &quot;Circuits insulated, perfect copy of my own engrams, moral imperatives hard-coded in...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t say it,&quot; Ben Grimm warned.</p><p class="double">&quot;I just don&#039;t know what went wrong!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I KNEW IT!&quot; The Thing threw his rocky arms up in frustration. &quot;I KNEW she&#039;d say it! She ALWAYS sez it!&quot; He shook his head and rumbled in a softer tone, &quot;I almos&#039; wish she really was evil, y&#039;know, Reed? I think a really evil Doctor Doom would do less damage!&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy didn&#039;t hear Reed Richards&#039; apology for the outburst, nor Grimm&#039;s. Two pairs of crossed eyes stared at each other, as the owner of the living pair contemplated the Loops, good intentions, narrative imperative, and cybernetic design.</p><p class="double">In her head she began composing a letter: &quot;Dear Twilight Strange; Hail to the Sorceress Supreme.

All very impressive.”</p><p class="double">“Then we went on a holiday alone together for a month,” Trixie added helpfully.</p><p class="double">The alicorn of love looked between the two of them, a suspicious glint in her eye.</p><p class="double">“And this<i> isn&#039;t</i> getting married?”</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Trixie replied promptly. “No matrimony involved.

There were times that Morganna decided to create the Eight Phases in the forms of little girls for absolutely no good reason. There was even that Loop where Haseo had been replaced with Kamina, which was perhaps the strangest of them all.</p><p class="double">Then again, at that very moment, Aura was quite sure that she had found a new strangest.</p><p class="double">“I hope everybody’s having a good time,” Pinkie Pie beamed as she bounced down the streets of Mac Anu. “This would be a very bad game if nobody was having a good time, especially with a party going on!”</p><p class="double">A collective cheer filled the streets of the Root Town, which were for the first time that Aura could think of decked out in streamers and other such party staples, despite the fact that models for such things were not natively within The World.</p><p class="double">The topic of things that did not exist natively within The World brought Aura’s attention back towards the girl in charge of the party.</p><p class="double">The girl named Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">The girl whose class was also Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">The girl whose class gave her the passive benefit of being Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">The girl who had the ability to pull party supplies out of nowhere, teleport whenever nobody was quite looking at her, enforce a promise between two people so long as they both made it within the game and with a certain phrase uttered, break whatever one of the laws of physics that would be convenient for her at any given moment, and once again be Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">And most importantly, the girl who the administrators could care less about, despite the fact that they hounded after even a perceived hacker in just about every Loop that Aura could think of other than a few rare variants.</p><p class="double">Regardless of how strange the sight was to her, Aura would readily admit that she found it to be incredibly amusing.</p><p class="double">Especially when she noticed Macha floating around in a silly party hat. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.4 (The One butcher)</p><p class="double"><i>None of them can overcome my Defence Value, even after a three attack Flurry.</i> Ditzy dodged like crazy even as she distributed knock out punches left and right.</p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t even need to stunt my Defence... And they can&#039;t surprise me from behind because of my extra eyes.</i></p><p class="double">Ditzy shoved the last of the bandits to the side and helped the girl to stand. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asked the young woman who stared at her in awe.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, My Princess of the Earth.&quot; She bowed deeply.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, stop that. I&#039;m not one of those Dragon thingies.&quot; she smiled at the girl who looked at her in confusion. Then looked at the unconscious army of bandits, then back at Ditzy.</p><p class="double">Then that confusion gave way to horrified realisation. &quot;Anathema...&quot; she whispered, before clamping her mouth shut and backing away.</p><p class="double">Ditzy rolled her eyes. &quot;I think I had noticed if I was a demon... I&#039;ve heard they are quite flashy and shiny.&quot; But it was too late, one of the more hale Bandits was already running in the direction of the nearby City, shouting &quot;ANATHEMA! ANATHEMA!&quot; at the top of her Lungs.</p><p class="double">Ditzy was quite confused with that behaviour. As far as her Loop Memories told her doing that was a sure-fire way to get killed by the demon in question. Doesn&#039;t matter, she wasn&#039;t one of those things and therefore didn&#039;t have anything to fear. If anything the false accusation and accompanying boost in her already quite fearsome reputation would make clearing the forests of Bandits even easier. It was a shame how many people got missing in these forests, while the Princesses and Princes who were supposed to protect the people were doing nothing.</p><p class="double">Ditzy waited.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, the Anathema. Finally we have found you.&quot; Sneered a voice behind her. Ditzy wasn&#039;t phased in the least, just calmly turning around smiling... Only to wrinkle her brow in confusion.</p><p class="double">What?</p><p class="double">Arrayed against her was a whole company of knights in shining Jade Armor in a multitude of colors. Behind them were four score bowmen, ready to shoot.</p><p class="double">Man, they were paranoid about those Anathingies... Good actually, that way they surely did less damage when they really appeared. Ditzy simply relaxed and smiled brightly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am really flattered that you would think that of me, and glad that you took the threat seriously enough to come in force. But I am not Exalted. The thing with the Bandits was all skill!&quot; Ditzy explained.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lies!&quot; The foremost shouted. &quot;It was foretold that we would encounter an Anathema here. That it would be the strongest who has ever lived, surpassing the powers of the First Age. We have laid in waiting for you to appear, biding our time for the last few weeks until you so foolishly revealed yourself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy frowned:&quot;If you were waiting for an Anathingy here, why didn&#039;t you take care of the Bandits?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who cares about these petty nuisances. They know not to bother anyone important. You are just trying to distract me.&quot; The man sneered. Ditzy was getting a bit irritated, but it would be long before she gave up Diplomacy, she was a Pony after all.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I&#039;d know if I was a demon. Surely there&#039;s a way to check?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure there are ways to check... Don&#039;t move a muscle.&quot; One of them came forward and laid hands on Ditzy. After a while he looked at the leader and shook hie head. He ran back into the Formation. &quot;And probably the Anathema have found some way around it with their foul sorcery. What you say makes sense... So you probably are using some kind of Silvertongued Magic on me, wasting your precious motes. Just as planned. And I know how to get around your evil influence.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Switching to Combat Ticks.

You blew FOUR BILLION XP on some kind of EXTREMELY INEFFECTIVE SUBSPACE POCKET? Why wouldn&#039;t you simply store the objects in a pocket dimension instead of inside your soul?

This Subspace Pocket is one of the only things that can carry objects from one Loop to the other, because I can take only my Soul itself with me, not attached Pocket dimensions. But it&#039;s also to make sure we use up all of the extra space in our soul in order to prevent us from becoming a kind of God that doesn&#039;t fit into the multiverse, thus breaking it. I guess I can stop growing my Pocket for a while to make this Exaltation thing work, but... aren&#039;t Solars the bad guys?&quot;</p><p class="double">The god blinked: &quot;No... they are the rightful rulers of Creation, having saved it from the whims of the Primordials.

Again.&quot; Discord shook his head, and some pebbles sprinkled out of one ear. &quot;It&#039;s bad enough I usually Awaken in stone here in Equestria, but when I spend an entire Hub Loop unable to move... well, my dear Twilight, it&#039;s enough to drive me sane.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not so I&#039;ve noticed,&quot; Twilight snarked back. &quot;But the Hub world doesn&#039;t have petrification, does it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I incarnated as this sort of legend, really. Up in New England. According to the legend a warlock escaped the Salem Witch Trials and fled north beyond Portland, swearing vengeance on his persecutors. The judge and several priests followed, chasing the warlock to an island in one of those innumerable bays. The legend says they tried to execute the warlock by pressing- by sandwiching him between two heavy slabs of stone- but he just would not die. So instead they piled all the rocks they could on top of him to trap him for eternity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds ghastly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Glad I wasn&#039;t Awake for it,&quot; Discord agreed. &quot;But the legend finishes by saying that the warlock&#039;s spirit is waiting for some fool to find his prison, remove the rocks and free him to unleash his evil once again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remove the... north of Portland...&quot; Twilight Sparkle gasped as the answer came to her. &quot;Do you mean to say-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I certainly do. I was,&quot; Discord declared, bringing himself erect on his stool and placing a hand dramatically to his breast, <i>&quot;the Rock Bound Ghost of Maine.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">A few moments later, Celestia came to. &quot;Mr. McIntosh Apple, I presume?&quot; she asked. &quot;It is good to see my student battling Discord... but shouldn&#039;t she be doing something more forceful than pelting peanuts at him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Enope,&quot; Big Mac said, pushing a very large, very alcoholic drink towards the princess. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.6 (Scarecrow11)</p><p class="double">&quot;…no gniog s&#039;tahw rof nosaer a evah reve I ekil&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;?ereh sdrawkcab gnihtyreve si yhW&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;?ytiraR seY&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;?thgiliwT&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.7 (Scarecrow11)</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon approached her friend at recess.

I was awake much earlier though. Barely more then a baby. I got to spend some time with my mom.&quot; Tiara&#039;s mom was a weird thing in the loops. Much like Scootaloo&#039;s parents, it changed from loop to loop. Sometimes she was alive, sometimes she wasn&#039;t. Sometimes she was a business pony like her father, sometimes she was wild and adventurous. Sometimes she was as bratty as baseline Tiara. Once she was called &#039;Screwloose&#039; and spent the loop in an asylum. But because she never impacted the baseline plot in any way, it always changed. </p><p class="double">&quot;She… passed away before I was even old enough to enter school.&quot; Tiara turned away, hiding her tears &quot;She held me as she passed. She told my father… that &#039;I&#039; was the greatest treasure they had.&quot; Taking a shuddering breath, she composed herself. </p><p class="double">She gestured to the tiara she was holding &quot;My father bought this for me soon after. Mom always said I was their little princess, and he said that &#039;With this crown, now everyone will know you&#039;re a Real Princess.&#039; &quot; she smiled softly &quot;It&#039;s just a toy, of course, but I never had the heart to tell him I knew.&quot; </p><p class="double">Spoon leaned over and hugged Tiara, who embraced her back. Letting go, Tiara looked at her friend with watery eyes &quot;Daddy… no matter what loop, he always does his best to be there for me, to love me no matter what. In baseline… oak I must have been so disappointing.&quot; she hugged the toy tiara close as she thought of what a brat she had been, how embarrassing her behavior must have been to her father. </p><p class="double">Spoon offered a smile &quot;Hey, it&#039;s alright, you&#039;re not like that now. You haven&#039;t been for a long time.&quot; </p><p class="double">Tiara nodded, wiping away the tears. &quot;You&#039;re right. I will NEVER be that way again. I will do my best to make my father, and my mother too, if I can, proud of me. I will be a daughter worthy of being called their princess. Their treasure.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.8 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">&quot;Here you go, girl. Eat up,&quot; said Sam as he loaded a generous pitchfork of hay into Applejack&#039;s stall at the Rivendell stables.</p><p class="double"><i>He&#039;s a sweet fella, but a mare&#039;s gotta have some time alone so she can finish her readin&#039;</i>, the pony grumbled to herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. And here&#039;s a nice apple for dessert. They have wonderful fruit here, y&#039;know.&quot; He put the treat on the stall door. &quot;Hello, Mister Gandalf, Mister Strider, Gimli,&quot; he greeted the three future members of the Fellowship. &quot;Here to check on Shadowfax?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. I see you&#039;re taking good care of fair Applejack,&quot; said the wizard. &quot;I think Frodo is looking for you. He said something about wanting to take a walk along the north path with Bilbo.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m fine, sugarcube. Go on and see to Frodo,&quot; added the pony <i>sotto vocce</i>.</p><p class="double">Sam scurried off.</p><p class="double">&quot;That pony did just speak, right?&quot; asked Gimli suspiciously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whinny?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shadowfax snorted his amusement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, cut it out,&quot; suggested Aragorn. &quot;He&#039;s Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gandalf gestured to the stable. &quot;I can talk to Elrond if you...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;all kin stop apologizin&#039; fer the accommodations already. It&#039;s comfy enough, and the food&#039;s just fine,&quot; said Applejack, showing signs of mild irritation. &quot;While I wouldn&#039;t mind gettin&#039; some time in the kitchens, the hay&#039;s top-rate, and I &#039;preciate the flowers, fruit, and other treats. &#039;course, if any of y&#039;all wanted drop off the odd plate of daisy sandwiches, I wouldn&#039;t say no. The bread smells wonderful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Moving on from the culinary tastes of our esteemed guest,&quot; said Gandalf. &quot;The Council went pretty much by-the-book. We three&quot; -- he gestured at the human and dwarf that had accompanied him -- &quot;thought we should bring you up to date and start considering our plans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So it&#039;s just the four of us Awake?&quot; asked the pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;And Galadriel,&quot; responded the wizard. &quot;Now, since this was a &#039;Pick up the story at Bree&#039; variant start, neither she nor I was able to take any action to neutralize Saruman, so the preferred alternative of going via the Gap or Rohan is much less desirable if we want to avoid unnecessary conflict. We need to stay here long enough for Anduril to be forged, but Aragorn hopes to get a sufficiently early start to avoid the storms at the Redhorn gate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are we discussing our plans with a pony?&quot; asked the scowling Gimli.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why should we not discuss our plans with a pony? Gimli, this is what? Your twentieth loop or so? As much loop experience as I have compared to you, she has a similar degree of experience compared to me,&quot; replied Gandalf.</p><p class="double">Applejack held up a hoof in protest. &quot;Yer an Anchor, I don&#039;t really think...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You are Twilight&#039;s Second. The second pony to loop after she started. How many loops had you experienced by the time your sister Ascended?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I lost count a ways before...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I had gone through less than a hundred by then, and only a handful of fused loops. I will certainly surpass you eventually, but I believe that you are easily the most experienced individual in the world at the moment, several times over.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But I&#039;ve only been Here under a dozen times, and none of them were related to your baseline in any significant way.&quot; She smiled absently at the memory of ten alicorns storming Mordor and blasting Barad Dur with the Elements of Harmony. &quot;And I&#039;ve just reached to the bit where Frodo and Sam get to Mount Doom in my readin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;By the sound of it, you&#039;ve covered most of the highlights as far as immediate plans are concerned,&quot; noted Aragorn. &quot;Due to the late start, we&#039;re stuck with the same situation as in the baseline, and can only make a few changes. We&#039;re still trying to destroy the Ring...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t suppose,&quot; she interrupted, &quot;you&#039;ve tried speedin&#039; up the travelin&#039; process with some teleports?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid that magical teleportation is usually not an option by this world&#039;s rules. Technological means have worked on occasion, and there was the one time Mnementh...&quot; Gandalf trailed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Too bad my sister ain&#039;t here; she can usually put together a Trek-style transporter in a few hours.&quot; mused Applejack.</p><p class="double">The two continued to swap ideas about how to proceed.</p><p class="double">&quot;And this is why we are discussing our plans with a pony,&quot; Aragorn explained to the bewildered Gimli.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;That animal can nearly talk,&quot; {Sam} said, &quot;and would talk, if she stayed here much longer. She gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it: if you don’t let me go with you, Sam, I’ll follow on my own.&quot;</p><p>-- Tolkien, J.R.R.; <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. (As amended by Applejack of Equestria.)</p><p class="double">&quot;Sam, sugarcube. Y&#039;all&#039;ll need somepony to carry the supplies, and since Shadowfax ain&#039;t built to travel in the mountains, I guess that means me,&quot; said a voice from the pony&#039;s general vicinity.</p><p>-- From a discarded draft of King Elesar&#039;s memoirs.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gandalf and Aragorn were able to shave about a month off their baseline departure date. Now in the last days of November, the Fellowship of the Ring stood outside the Last Homely House waiting for Gandalf to emerge from a last-minute consultation with Elrond.</p><p class="double">Sam was fussing with the pony&#039;s pack, muttering about the supplies. &quot;Rope! No rope! And only last night you said to yourself: &#039;Sam, what about a bit of rope? You’ll want it, if you haven’t got it.&#039; Well, I’ll want it. I can’t get it now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Check again under the extra blankets, sugarcube.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sam was mildly astonished to find a coil of sturdy rope. He took a long considering look at the pony.</p><p class="double">Applejack gazed back impassively, then essayed an innocent nicker.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;ll need to remember to ask Bloom or Rarity to make me some of that artificial spider silk rope and make sure it looks like ordinary hemp. Good thing Aragorn keeps a decent supply of it in his Pocket.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, my girl,&quot; said the hobbit somberly, &quot;you oughtn’t to have took up with us. You could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Taking a cue from her baseline counterpart, Applejack swished her tail and said nothing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">At last, the Company set out (on foot: Shadowfax had reluctantly returned to Rohan a while after the Council) following a final (and to Applejack&#039;s mind, redundant) admonition from Elrond about not doing anything stupid with the Ring.</p><p class="double">After two dreary and overcast weeks of traveling during the hours of darkness to avoid observation, the party reached the borders of the long-abandoned realm of Hollin and Gandalf called for a day&#039;s rest. While Legolas occupied his time as lookout, the hobbits spent their time either resting their weary feet or working on their swordsmanship with coaching from Boromir.</p><p class="double">Gandalf, Aragorn, and Gimli considered the road ahead. For some reason they had gathered near their beast of burden.</p><p class="double">&quot;So are we really going to try the pass of Caradhras, or should we bite the bullet and go straight for Moria?&quot; asked Gimli.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll admit that we&#039;ve never had much luck with the pass, but there was that one time...&quot; replied Aragorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Unless one of you picked up some skill at weather control and hadn&#039;t gotten around to telling me about it...&quot; interrupted Gandalf. He spared a glance toward the pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think ya got me confused with Rainbow Dash. Even at full power, I&#039;m no weathermare,&quot; objected Applejack. &quot;Anyways, if y&#039;all&#039;re interested in my opinion, I&#039;m gettin&#039; a real bad feelin&#039; &#039;bout that peak yonder. I think Spike&#039;d call it a Dark Side nexus. I&#039;m also pickin&#039; up somethin&#039; from the rocks that&#039;s between mischief and malice, shadin&#039; toward the second.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gimli was again staring at the pony. &quot;You can sense the very stone and how it feels?&quot;</p><p class="double">She shook her head in an equine shrug. &quot;Just sayin&#039; how I read the terrain ahead.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay. If we try the pass and there&#039;s unseasonal snow, we&#039;ll go for the low road. Satisfied?&quot; asked Aragorn</p><p class="double">There was grudging agreement.</p><p class="double">As the wizard and dwarf went off, Aragorn paused. &quot;I&#039;ve been meaning to ask. How do you keep that hat on in all the wind we&#039;ve had on this journey?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Picked up the knack from Henry Jones jr. a while back. I got no idea where he learned it.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So here we are at the Hidden Gate of Moria,&quot; declared Boromir to nobody in particular, &quot;against my better judgement, I&#039;ll add.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Kwitcherbellyachin&#039; already,&quot; muttered Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wish he&#039;d stop going on about that,&quot; murmured Sam to Frodo in a echo of the pony&#039;s words</p><p class="double">&quot;You were enthusiastic enough about the decision when the wargs started howling,&quot; pointed out Gimli.</p><p class="double">The company had turned back from Caradhras when the weather took a threatening turn. An overnight encounter with a pack of possibly phantom wargs – as in the baseline, the morning after the skirmish had left no sign of their adversaries – had hastened their journey to this point</p><p class="double">Gandalf was now making a show of searching for the hidden doors as the Gondorian and dwarf bickered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Would it not be a good time to unload our faithful pony and determine what we much carry ourselves and what can be left behind?&quot; Legolas asked Aragorn. &quot;As steadfast and brave as she has been, the mines would not be a safe place for her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;d follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon’s den, if I led her,&quot; protested Sam. &quot;It&#039;d be nothing short of murder to turn her loose with all these wolves about.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;With Sam to look after her, I believe she can make the journey,&quot; said Aragorn after a thoughtful pause. &quot;Still, I expect she wouldn&#039;t object if we lightened her load. Keep all the food, fodder, and especially the water bottles. The cold-weather gear will probably not be needed as we go further south.&quot;</p><p class="double">The hobbits made themselves useful unloading the pony and sorting through the packs. Applejack took the opportunity to join Aragorn at the edge of the ominous lake that had filled the valley at the doorstep of the abandoned dwarf kingdom.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anything more I oughta know about Watcher?&quot; she asked Aragorn quietly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just stay alert. It usually strikes shortly after we open the doors. At least Gimli is keeping Boromir from throwing rocks, and Pippin is similarly occupied.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. There we are!&quot; declared Gandalf after revealing the <i>ithildin</i> markings that indicated the door. The rest of the company gathered around to peer at the design.</p><p class="double">&quot;What does the writing say?&quot; asked Frodo, trying to decipher the inscription on the arch. &quot;I thought I knew the elf-letters, but I cannot read these.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,&quot; answered Gandalf. &quot;They do not say much of consequence. They say only: The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. And underneath small and faint is written: I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs. Or in the original Sindarin: <i>Ennyn Durin aran Moria. Pedo mellon</i>...&quot;</p><p class="double">The doors slowly swung open.</p><p class="double">Ignoring the dirty look from Gimli, the wizard clapped his hands. &quot;Right! Are we ready to get going? No? Well let&#039;s not dawdle...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s attention was focused on the lake. Her life-sensing abilities picked out the location of the creature that lurked there as it roused and started to move toward the Company. <i>Let&#039;s see if I can discourage the critter</i>...</p><p class="double">She snorted nervously, stamping a hoof. Deep in the lake, a stone column erupted from the lakebottom to pummel the beast from below. A few ripples formed on the surface.</p><p class="double">She felt it circle and make another move toward their shore. Another stamp, and another column rose to block its way. More ripples appeared on the lake surface.</p><p class="double">&quot;Easy girl,&quot; soothed Sam as he gently reloaded her pack saddle.</p><p class="double">Yet another circle. Yet more stamping. This time two columns met at an angle to crush something between them.</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s something going on out in the lake,&quot; commented Legolas. The lake&#039;s surface was showing a fair amount of turbulence by now.</p><p class="double">With a mild feeling of satisfaction, Applejack perceived a vague impression of disgust from her victim and sensed it retreating to a deeper part of the waters.</p><p class="double">After several seconds of watching the ripples expand and reach the shore with a distinct lack of additional activity, the party took up their burdens and cautiously crossed the threshhold into the mines. Beyond a small antechamber, there was a broad, gentle stairway leading upward into the gloom.</p><p class="double">&quot;Take them up about fifty steps, Aragorn. I&#039;ll see what can be done about the doors,&quot; instructed Gandalf.</p><p class="double">As Sam led Applejack past the wizard, she balked momentarily and gently nudged the doors with a combination of earthbending and the Force. They slowly swung shut with a surprisingly quiet thud.</p><p class="double">Igniting a faint spark at the end of his staff, Gandalf paused to give the pony a long look before moving up the stairs to the head of the Company.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;He is dead then. I feared it was so,&quot; said Frodo as the company looked at Balin&#039;s tomb.</p><p class="double">It had been an uneventful and by-the-book trek through the mines. The incident with Pippin and the rock dropped into the well had been prevented by a combination of keeping the young hobbit busy and an explicit threat from Gandalf: &quot;And if you even consider playing with that hole in the floor, I&#039;ll arrange for you to make a personal inspection. This is a serious journey, not some hobbit walking-party!&quot;</p><p class="double">(&quot;Not that it makes much of a difference in the grand scheme of things,&quot; the wizard had explained when the incident was brought up during their planning sessions in Rivendell. &quot;We almost always encounter orcs shortly after we reach Balin&#039;s tomb. Still, the effort should be made.&quot;)</p><p class="double">&quot;This appears to be the remains of a book,&quot; observed Gandalf, lifting the badly damaged volume from its niche. &quot;We don&#039;t have much time, but I hope to glean some notion of where we are...&quot;</p><p class="double">As the remainder of the party clustered to peer at the book&#039;s contents, Applejack edged toward the half-open stone doors on the west end of the room and concentrated on the rock in their general area. She felt Aragorn&#039;s walking to her side.</p><p class="double">&quot;Got a fair number makin&#039; their way up from below,&quot; she reported. &quot;Want me to do somethin&#039; about &#039;em?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Chamber of Records. I guess that is where we now stand,&quot; Gimli was saying.</p><p class="double">&quot;If that is the case, then we entered from the twenty-first hall, which means we take the east arch and go down to the gate level,&quot; decided Gandalf. &quot;Take the book, Gimli. We will give it a closer look when there is more time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack judged that the lead party of orcs was perhaps twenty-five steps from the top of the stairs that let onto their level. Seeing Aragorn&#039;s nod, she reared and stomped both forehooves to the stone.</p><p class="double">There was a chorus of surprised voices as two or three levels of steps were remolded into steep inclined planes, causing upwards of fifty warriors to tumble backwards and downwards.</p><p class="double">&quot;Orcs!&quot; cried the ranger. &quot;And it sounds as if they were moving up from the east arch!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Everyone up and ready to move,&quot; ordered Gandalf, moving to join Aragorn. &quot;Boromir, watch the east door.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Gondorian went to the small door on the opposite side of the room.</p><p class="double">&quot;I kin block the passage fer a bit. Dunno how long it&#039;ll last against a balrog, tho,&quot; offered the pony.</p><p class="double">Gandalf&#039;s expression went abstracted for a long moment; Applejack recognized the look of one consulting the Force. &quot;Yes. Seal the arch, and then this door.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya got it. Wanna pretend it&#039;s yer doin&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You are most considerate,&quot; said the wizard drawing himself to his full height and raising his staff. He started chanting in an unknown elven dialect. Aragorn shouldered the door shut.</p><p class="double">The pony backed away, then whinnied in feigned fright, rearing and bucking as Aragorn held onto her lead rope. Faint grinding noises from outside of the room could be heard over the wizard&#039;s words.</p><p class="double">Sam hurried up to help. &quot;Steady, girl. Steady...&quot;</p><p class="double">After one final buck directed at the closed door, she allowed the hobbit to lead her to the rest of the party clustered at the room&#039;s quiescent east entrance. Aragorn noted that the stone of the floor and lintel had flowed to meld with the door itself. &quot;She&#039;s finished. You can stop chanting those song lyrics now,&quot; he murmured to Gandalf as he too moved to the east door.</p><p class="double">The wizard made a display of shouting a few final words at the west door, complete with a flash from the tip of his staff. He slowly walked to join the group. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, as if tired from a great effort, &quot;I have done all I can for now. The door has been secured. This secondary passage should bring us to the main halls...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I knew things were goin&#039; too smooth,&quot; muttered the orange pony as the Company emerged into the Second Hall. To their left was the famed Bridge of Khazad-Dum.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ai! ai!&quot; wailed Legolas. &quot;A Balrog! A Balrog is here!&quot;</p><p class="double">Looming in front of the bridge stood Durin&#039;s Bane.</p><p class="double">To their right was a chasm of fire, separating them from a howling mass of orcs and trolls.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aragorn, Gimli...watch our backs. Boromir, Legolas...mind the hobbits. This is a foe beyond all of you,&quot; ordered Gandalf with grim determination as he deliberately strode toward the shadowy demon.</p><p class="double">&quot;You cannot pass.&quot; The Balrog&#039;s voice came out as a combination of a basso rumble and a hiss.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor,&quot; declared Gandalf, as he drew himself up before the towering form.</p><p class="double">As the unawake members of the Fellowship were focused on the confrontation, Applejack took the opportunity to erect a substantial wall to block off interference from the Balrog&#039;s minions.</p><p class="double">&quot;You cannot pass,&quot; repeated the Balrog, producing a flaming whip and cracking it over the head of its adversary.</p><p class="double">&quot;The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun. Go back to the Shadow!&quot; commanded the wizard, adjusting the grip on his staff and moving Glamdring to a high guard position.</p><p class="double">&quot;You cannot pass,&quot; growled the Balrog a third time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Big guy needs to add some variety to his lines,&quot; observed Applejack.</p><p class="double">Boromir blinked at the oddly placid pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;Terrified whinny? Nervous snort,&quot; she added, straining half-heartedly at Sam&#039;s grip on her lead rope.</p><p class="double">The Company&#039;s attention was returned to the confrontation before the bridge as a great red flaming sword swept out and down at the wizard.</p><p class="double">A brief ringing clash of metal and a brilliant flash later, the Balrog&#039;s sword was a shower of fragments and the demon had taken a long step backward onto the bridge.</p><p class="double">Gandalf set down his staff and started to chant, quietly yet clearly:</p><p class="double">&quot;In fearful day, in raging night,</p><p>With strong hearts full, our souls ignite.</p><p>When all seems lost in the War of Light,</p><p>Look to the stars, for hope burns bright!&quot;</p><p class="double">His blue-gray robes and hat took on a decidedly brighter hue and he was surrounded in a distinct pale blue nimbus.</p><p class="double"><i>Shoulda figgered he&#039;d&#039;ve picked up a Power Ring by now</i>, mused the pony. <i>And the oath does seem to fit Arda mythology pretty well...</i></p><p class="double">The Balrog surged forward, whip cracking.</p><p class="double">Gandalf dodged the burning tendrils and took to the air, responding with a series of energy bolts to its face, forcing the larger form further back onto the bridge.</p><p class="double">Enraged, Durin&#039;s Bane leapt at the blue glowing figure, arms spread wide as if seeking to crush the wizard under its body.</p><p class="double">An enormous blue cylinder -- Applejack thought it resembled a rolled-up newspaper of all things -- knocked the great airborne body into void with a terrible cry. A flailing limb caught the bridge and knocked out a large chunk of rock from the arch.</p><p class="double">Its structure weakened, the rest of the bridge followed the Balrog into the chasm several seconds later, leaving two short stubs of rock at either end of the sixteen-yard gap.</p><p class="double">Gandalf returned to the ground and started cursing. <i>I ain&#039;t no expert, but I think he needs to work on his Huttese accent</i>, thought Applejack.</p><p class="double">The Company cautiously advanced to the edge of the abyss, staying several wary feet from the ranting wizard.</p><p class="double">&quot;That bridge gets broken, shattered, disintegrated, or otherwise destroyed almost every loop. It&#039;s been getting on his nerves lately,&quot; murmured Aragorn as he joined the pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;I kin sympathize. Think he&#039;d mind if I took care of it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably best to wait for him to regain his composure.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Interlude in Mac&#039;s Bar}</p><p class="double">&quot;I heard another version of that bit,&quot; interrupted Berry Punch.</p><p class="double">&quot;Beg pardon?&quot; inquired Applejack politely.</p><p class="double">The mixologist held up a placating hoof. &quot;Now, I&#039;m not saying your version is wrong. Just that I&#039;ve heard a different account. I replaced Butterbur about five to ten loops back, and Aragorn and I got to trading stories...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Balrog surged forward, whip cracking.</p><p class="double">Gandalf gracefully slipped to one side, taking to the air in something between a leap and actual levitation. As his foe passed, he slashed with Glamdring, taking off the Balrog&#039;s left arm at the shoulder. The severed limb tumbled into the abyss.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now stand aside,&quot; he ordered.</p><p class="double">&quot; &#039;Tis but a scratch,&quot; countered the Balrog.</p><p class="double">&quot;A scratch?&quot; asked the incredulous wizard. &quot;Your arm&#039;s off!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No it isn&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">Watching the familiar (to her) scenario play out, Applejack facehoofed and looked for a nearby pillar or wall to bang her head against.</p><p class="double">By the time Durin&#039;s Bane had been reduced to a ranting torso, Gandalf was clearly elated. He gently wrapped the demon in a blue halo of energy and deposited it near the south wall of the hall. Beaming, the wizard started shepherding the others to the bridge and beyond.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think this may be the first time in over a hundred loops that bridge has remained intact. He&#039;s been getting kind of twitchy about it,&quot; Aragorn explained to the pony as they organized for the crossing. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.9 (Scarecrow11)</p><p class="double">Rainbow Awoke mid-flight, but experience had taught her how to not loose her cool and crash. A quick check into Loyalty&#039;s magic told her that the Applejack, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, and Fluttershy were all awake, but for some reason she didn&#039;t get a location or response from Twilight…</p><p class="double">Checking her loop memories, she found that she was still a weather manager… but in Cloudsdale. Apparently she had still dropped out of flight school, but had stayed in her hometown. Asking around, she found out who her replacement was in Ponyville: Lightning Dust.</p><p class="double">Huh… this might make for an interesting variation.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack looked at her unawake sister who was busy tinkering in their garage. That wasn&#039;t so strange, but the fact that she was working on the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 4000 was. This was looking to be a strange loop, as her memories told her that she was still an Apple, but that Sweet Apple Acres didn&#039;t belong to them. Apparently after her parents had passed, a distraught Granny Smith had sold the farm to the Flim Flam clan.</p><p class="double">Applejack wasn&#039;t sure how to feel about that, but figured it might be a good idea to convince Applebloom and Big Mac that a vacation was in order as an excuse to go find her friends, plan out their loop… and see how growing up on a farm had changed those two no good swindlers.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie didn&#039;t even slow her bouncing as she made her way down the country road. Her hat never left her head, and her bedazzled cowgirl&#039;s shawl flapped in the wind. She was apparently replacing Cheese Sandwich this loop, and that didn&#039;t bother her at all. After all: Have Party, Will Travel!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Futtershy looked at the two goats, who stared blankly back, then out at the crowd, who looked on as though waiting for something. Shaking her head, she adjusted her tie and began her seminar on compassion, kindness, and non-assertiveness. Even though she really wanted to know why she was replacing Iron Will, these ponies had come expecting a show, and it would be so rude to have them leave disappointed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Working in Manehatten was always a bit of a thrill for Rarity, even after all this time. While she would always love working in Ponyville, she would not deny that city life was exciting, and the fashion trends unpredictable!</p><p class="double">What she liked less was replacing Suri Polomare, that thieving, back stabbing… Rarity took a calming breath. There was no reason to get upset, and after the first time it happened to her non-looping self, she&#039;d avoided falling for Suri&#039;s schemes every time.</p><p class="double">Hearing the ring of the bell above her door, she gave a warm smile to her customer. A smile that only grew when she saw who it was.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um… hello, my name&#039;s Coco Pommel… I&#039;m here because I saw an ad saying you needed an assistant?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded &quot;Of course, and I can already tell you&#039;ll be just perfect.&quot; Even if she wasn&#039;t looping, it&#039;d still be nice to get to know the nice young mare better. As Pinkie or Twilight would say, you could never have too many friends</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was not amused at her current situation. Glaring at the statue in front of her, she gave the bottom a kick, as though expecting her foot to pass through. Nothing. &quot;Well bark and roots.&quot; she grumbled before turning back to Canterlot High. While interesting the first time, high school as a human quickly got old.</p><p class="double">It was gonna be a long loop… </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.10 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Vinyl was busy.</p><p class="double">What she was busy doing was a matter for debate. Those just glancing in the window would figure she was busy brushing her teeth. Those in the dorm rooms of the Music Guild Trainee Hall with her would figure she was busy mixing a new track. To Octavia, right behind her, she was clearly laying in bed playing around with what could only be called Electric Keyboard Teeth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Vinyl, do I want to know how you are able to do this?&quot; she shouted over the racket of Vinyl&#039;s glasses, presently subwoofers, and the blaring of her teeth performing loud music.</p><p class="double">&quot;Magic fruit.&quot; Vinyl called back, pausing in her playing, then glancing down at her hoof as she noticed the stopped music. &quot;Dang. Note to self, Mouth Organ less than ideal. Can&#039;t talk while using it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia blinked. &quot;Magic fruit? Vinyl, that just raises more questions.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, chill Tavi. I hardly destroy anything I don&#039;t want to anymore!&quot; Vinyl grinned, ignoring the even more perplexed and slightly concerned look on Octavia&#039;s face as she stood there with her mouth open, trying to pick between a dozen things to comment on. &quot;I do need an idea for a new instrument though... The guild&#039;s talent show next week gives bonus points the farther the instrument used is from their usual one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia slumped, giving up on making sense of her roommate, and with a sigh reached over to Vinyl, swiped her glasses, and walked out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! I need those! Get back here! You can&#039;t keep taking my glasses whenever you feel like it! I only have one pair!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One of us is drunk! I&#039;m not sure which! You&#039;ll get them back when this is no longer the case!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweet! We going drinking?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her response was the slamming of their door as Octavia left.</p><p class="double">Vinyl just pouted. &quot;Man, I hate practising on just acoustics.&quot; she muttered as she looked down at her bass guitar foreleg, still in need of tuning. &quot;Tavi really needs to lighten up this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Octavia glanced about the recording studio nervously as she poked her head in. Spotting nopony, she grinned and put on Vinyl&#039;s glasses, wildly tussled her mane, and slid the door&#039;s lock closed. A few minutes of setup later, and DJ Sym4hony was all set for a rehearsal run. If Vinyl was just using a keyboard, no matter how strange, the talent show this year was hers for sure! </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.11&nbsp;&nbsp;(Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">Scootaloo&#039;s awakenings were, to put it lightly, a mixed bag. More often than not, she awoke in Ponyville in either a loving home, an abusive one or the local orphanage. The latter two, Scoots often chased down Dash to be adopted. It was not uncommon, however, for her to awake outside Ponyville for whatever reason: from Cloudsdale to Apploosa, from the muddy roads leading from Canterlot to the deep forests of Hollow Shade, she had awoken all over Equestria.</p><p class="double">The grime covered alleyway of Manehatten was where Scoots found herself this time. Her stomach was empty, not the &#039;I&#039;m hungry&#039; type of empty but rather true hunger which gnawed at the mind and drove ponies mad. Her looping memories were fuzzy, with pieces missing. She shook her head, recognizing a memory altering spell from that time she awoke after being neuralized in the MIB universe. She quickly ascended and removed the memory block, which caused her to stagger. She was Scootaloo, the outcast daughter of a former mob boss who instead of letting her be one of his weaknesses, threw her out after his unicorn lieutenant cast a memory charm on her.</p><p class="double">She sent out a ping, to which there was no response. She blinked and sent out another ping, then suffused herself with Loyalty&#039;s magic to make sure. No Twilight, no Dash, nothing. Gritting her teeth, she reared back and slammed her back hoof into a nearby trashcan, sending tumbling across the alleyway making a huge clatter. Several moments pass as she contemplated her next move, only for a voice from the street echoed, &quot;Hey, someone down there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Chlorophyll,&quot; she cursed to herself as she cast a <i>notice me not</i> spell. As an alicorn, she had no desire to become a princess of Equestria this loop. Then, the unexpected occurred, &quot;You down there, are you alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">The previous voice continued as someone drew closer. Scoots eyes landed on the stallion, an earth pony with a navy blue coat and black mane with a law enforcement badge for a cutie mark and sporting a police cap. His eyes were firmly planted on Scoots, meaning the spell wasn&#039;t affecting him. Confused, Scootaloo failed to respond as the larger pony bent over the looper, &quot;Are you alright, kiddo?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo blinked, her wits returning after they took a temporary leave, &quot;Uh...yeah, I&#039;m...I&#039;m just fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">The police pony gave her a one over, his eyes betraying his disbelief...though at what was a mystery. His voice took on a calming tone, &quot;Are you alone? Do you have any parents or relatives that can take you in?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scoots bit her lips, feeling uncomfortable at remembering her parents. She wouldn&#039;t head back to him, that&#039;s for sure. However, Dash wasn&#039;t awake and Twilight was always punctual with responding to the ping. Her thoughts were interrupted by the officer, &quot;Well you don&#039;t have to talk about it, yet. You want some pie? I know this nice diner just down the street. In fact, I was just finishing my shift and heading that way. Either that or I can take you to the station where you&#039;ll be safe.&quot;</p><p class="double">The choice was easy with her stomach still screaming at her for food.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Though the pie paled in comparison to Pinkie&#039;s confections, it was indeed good pie. The alicorn crusader wiped her mouth with a napkin, &quot;It&#039;s good. Someday, you should try Sugarcube Corner in Ponyville. Pinkie there makes the best pies you&#039;ve ever tasted, along with every other desert you could imagine.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pony chuckled, &quot;Though I haven&#039;t had much luck with small towns, I may visit someday, just to see if it&#039;s better than the one here.&quot;</p><p class="double">He removed his hat and set it on the filly&#039;s head, &quot;By the way, my name is Chief Swan. I&#039;m the chief of Manehatten&#039;s police force for the last ten years.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo tilted the hat up and gave a bright grin, &quot;Scootaloo, nice to meet you!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chief looked at the filly, &quot;Are you from Ponyville?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I consider it my home, though I haven&#039;t been there in several years,&quot; referring to her loop memories of living her whole life in Manehatten.</p><p class="double">Chief nodded, &quot;And how long have you been living in that alley?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scoots bit her lip, &quot;A few months, after dad threw me out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chief&#039;s mouth drooped faster than the equestrian train could cover 100 feet, &quot;Now why would someone <i>throw out</i> a sweet little filly like you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shrugged, &quot;Maybe he thought I was a burden and didn&#039;t want to take care of me, or maybe he thought he was protecting me by throwing me out.&quot;</p><p class="double">The police pony gave a sad grin, &quot;You&#039;re a brave girl, surviving on your own like that. Who are your parents?&quot;</p><p class="double">With a couple names, the Chief&#039;s expression turned neutral, clearly recognizing those names but his eyes still showed deep concern for the filly. They continued for a bit, with Chief asking questions and giving small jokes to lighten the mood and Scoots answering as best as she could.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After an hour had passed, the Chief rose from his spot, &quot;Well, I better get you to the station so you can give a statement. I think you&#039;ll enjoy it, just think of it like you&#039;re a cop helping us solve a puzzle.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the two made their way out of the diner and through the crowd, Scootaloo decided to send the ping again, just in case she awoke before Twilight this time. The result was, once again, unexpected. As the Ping echoed across Equestria, the police pony stopped mid-stride, turned around and started looking around...almost as if...</p><p class="double">Curious now, Scootaloo sent another ping, causing Chief to stare directly at Scootaloo, &quot;Are you the one doing that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo blinked, &quot;Well, yes? Have you ever...experienced time repeating itself over and over again?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chief&#039;s surprised expression morphed into a big grin, &quot;So you are also a looper. I&#039;m sorry, I can recognize the ping, but I never felt the need to send my own. I prefer to keep to myself for the most part.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo waved it off, &quot;It&#039;s OK. What&#039;s your actual name and where is your home?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My name is Charlie Swan, and I&#039;m in the Twilight loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo winced, &quot;Ouch, I&#039;m sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chief shook his head, &quot;That&#039;s partially why I keep to myself. People always pity me for that, and being the father of Bella.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scoots&#039; ears flattened against his head, &quot;I&#039;m sorry. Equestria is a sanctuary, and we should be more open and welcoming than that. Heck, we were better to Leah the first time she came.&quot;</p><p class="double">The police pony rested his hoof against the top of her mane, &quot;It&#039;s OK. I can tell you meant nothing by it. Leah said great things about this place.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, the two continued, starting a new conversation about their looping adventures.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Over the next several weeks, Scootaloo found herself visited by Chief Swan several times, often with visits to the diner they shared. Scootaloo sensed it was getting close to Twist&#039;s cutecenera, and she would have to leave Manehatten soon. However as the time wound down, she found herself across from Chief one last time before he popped a big question, &quot;Scoots, I know Dash usually adopts you...but since she&#039;s not awake...I was wondering if I could adopt you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scoots was surprised, but accepted it quickly, especially after she found out he was retiring soon and wanted to settle down in Ponyville. Within a week, the adoption went through and the two found themselves on the train to Ponyville. Scootaloo shared everything about the town, &quot;And finally, be ready for Pinkie&#039;s surprise party. Since we&#039;re the newest residents, she&#039;ll throw us a mega ultra super duper party, especially for families.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chief gave a small chuckle. &quot;I&#039;m looking forward to it.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she smiled, Scootaloo idly wondered who&#039;d turn out be the Anchor. If it was one of those Trek stealth Anchors, things could get interesting...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.12 (Misterq, Edited by Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Ditzy, what does your cutie mark mean,&quot; asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">Ditzy put a hoof to her mouth, &quot;My cutie mark is actually for computer programming. They&#039;re little ones and zeroes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, &quot;There aren&#039;t any ones there. They&#039;re all just zeros.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy&#039;s eyes widened, &quot;Oh! I guess that explains why my giant robots keep going out of control.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave her a look, &quot;What giant-&quot;</p><p class="double">The ground shook as a massive Pegasus dropped from the sky, &quot;KILL! CRUSH! DESTROY! DERP!&quot;</p><p class="double">The robot&#039;s oversized and cross-eyed eyes glowed red, then beams of destruction raked across Ponyville. Thankfully, no one was killed by the blast. Furthermore thanks to the poorly designed targeting system, the only property damage was an insignificant tree library. </p><p class="double">A second later, the massive robot was enveloped in a purple glow, then crushed like an aluminium can. Ditzy looked at her friend, whose mane was frazzled and eye twitching, &quot;Ditzy, I need to be alone for a bit.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy wisely flew away, leaving Twilight to mourn her poor library. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">106.13 (namar13766)</p><p class="double">Nyx grinned at her &#039;older sister.&#039; &quot;Mom, does this technically mean Sunset&#039;s having a Sister Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just chuckled. &quot;Close enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset, the in-loop twin sister of Shining Armor, let out an exasperated but amused huff. &quot;Well then, as your EEEVILLL Older Sister, I propose we go out and eat our body weight in Ice Cream.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YAY!&quot; </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>107.1 (The One Butcher)</p><p class="double">Twilight watched in resignation as the fireball streaked towards her Library, when suddenly a gigantic Pillar of Light erupted from the Building.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; she thought, &quot;at least it will be destroyed in a novel way!&quot; The Light exploded upwards and suddenly Tirek was hit in the face with a supersonic Projectile.</p><p class="double">There was a sickening crack as his magical defenses were overcome. Twilight watched in horror as Tirek&#039;s head was blown away. &quot;NO!&quot;, she shouted, &quot;You killed him!&quot; She looked in the direction of the Light, which had formed into a gigantic fiercely scowling looking Unicorn. Actually going by the proportions of the head it looked like a Unicorn Foal. A vaguely familiar looking Unicorn Foal. On which the fierce expression of divine wrath looked nothing but cute. &quot;Dinky? What the Oak happened to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually it&#039;s me!&quot; a cheerful voice greeted her from below.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ditzy! You killed Tirek!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, while with my three dot speciality on baked goods and Fists of Iron Technique I could actually kill him with one throw, I used Ox-Stunning Blow instead, making the Attack Non-lethal, no matter the overkill.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>YOU BLEW HIS HEAD OFF!</i>&quot; Twilight shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Doesn&#039;t matter, the Charm says Non-lethal.

We can cross reference with the source later.&quot; She turned back to Derpy. &quot;So, statistical analysis of that &quot;Excellency&quot; of yours shows a thirty per cent chance of one sucess and a ten percent chance of two sucesses, the total of which needs to beat a Target number. That Number is lowered by this Second Excellency. The number of dice is determined by your Skill and how much of a Large Bale you are.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ditzy giggled. &quot;Kinda.

You can easily perform the craziest stunts, but aren&#039;t any different in your day to day tasks? And you can expend your Essence to succeed at will, but if you do it too much you start glowing like a bonfire until that giant Dinky appears in a giant Pillar of light.&quot; After Tirek was fine and Derpy tied him up with nothing(she had a charm that let her ignore the penalty and treat nothing as &quot;Perfect Tools&quot; for the Job.) this didn&#039;t particularly faze her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Also I can with time and research expand these powers to do anything, no matter how illogical.

They called the Solar Demons because they bore a terrible curse causing them to slowly and sometimes suddenly but temporarily go insane!&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy gulped. &quot;Okay... I&#039;ll turn off all my defences so you can check it over. You can break that curse, can&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. &quot;It&#039;s several levels over Narrative Causality. An admin could, but it might involve removing your Exaltation, which is... not fun. It&#039;s programmed into your soul.&quot; Twilight bit her lip. &quot;I&#039;ll see what I can do. Maybe I can steer it into a suicidally reckless manifestation instead of a sociopathic one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy didn&#039;t hesitate. &quot;Please do.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight charged her Horn and laid it onto the Pegasus, delving deep into her soul.</p><p class="double">The Exaltation was, even Tainted, a thing of beauty. The infinitely complex structures of Autochthon were shored up and made absolute with the shining <i>Essence</i> of the Unconquered Sun. And there it was, the Corrupted Tainted Malediction of the Neverborn, dormant until activated.</p><p class="double">Actually... Shouldn&#039;t it have been activated already? Derpy&#039;s virtue Flaw was... Nothing? There was the Curse, there was the Potential, there was the natural defence of the Mind against it, the Limit Pool. Empty, pristine, unused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Say, Derpy, this thing should have gained power each time you were under mental stress or had to fight off Mental influence. How long did you have these powers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, the Loop where I got them was sixty four years. I think it would have lasted longer, but the Anchor died of old Age. Or that&#039;s what my Investigation Excellency tells me. I don&#039;t know much about stress, but for mental influence I had that telepathy thingy Diamond taught me and Vinyl. It&#039;s really easy to reinforce with Essence!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight scratched her head. &quot;So... You just happened to never gain any Limit? I&#039;ll give you a copy of the Rulebooks in order to show you what to avoid until we can get admin assistance. I&#039;ll have to regularly check you over though.&quot; Twilight said warily.</p><p class="double">After Ditzy read through the relevant sections she spoke up again: &quot;Actually, I think my Virtue flaw is Compassion and Worry. But I don&#039;t worry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave her a flat stare. &quot;That is probably the Curse talking. You should very much be worried about that curse! It caused countless atrocities in that World!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Twilight, I mean that I didn&#039;t gain any Limit, because I never worry. We should be careful anyway, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll gain much Limit except under really extreme circumstances. I may be a new Looper, but I have enough Memories of countless terrible things that I know it will all turn out alright.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.2 (compiled w/ minor edits by Conceptualist)</p><p class="double">(masterofgames)</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay everypony, new round!

They were all just things you said without thinking about what they meant. It didn&#039;t even impact the foals&#039; behaviour.

I turned you all into magical talking ponies!&quot;</p><p class="double">As Discord fell over backwards laughing, Celestia couldn&#039;t help but look puzzled at the concept. It did almost seem like something Discord would do, but at such a scale?</p><p class="double">The draconequus stood up, still giggling. &quot;Well then, seeing as my job here is done, I&#039;ll just be on my way. Thanks to you, I&#039;ve got ages of vacation time saved up.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Discord turned to the chest containing the Elements, and threw it open. He started to blindly lob the contents over his shoulder, towards the ponies watching. Celestia was quick to catch the Elements as they flew by, while Twilight was quick to catch Miss Smarty Pants as she did the same. Amongst the debris followed other toys, knick-knacks, a rubber duck, Luna&#039;s regalia, and a live chicken.</p><p class="double">Finally, he stopped to pull out a very large sombrero, and a hawaiian shirt. Donning them, he turned to address them. &quot;I, am going to Disneyland.&quot; He vanished with a snap of his claws.</p><p class="double">And promptly reappeared a second later. &quot;Does Disneyland still exist?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Weeks later, Celestia was walking toward one of the Guard&#039;s interview rooms. Hours before, a strange creature had appeared in the castle, seeking her. According to the report Shining Armor gave her, it was claiming to be her missing student, from years past.</p><p class="double">Entering the room, she saw the creature sitting at the table. It seemed like some kind of mostly bald, hornless minotaur. Its mane though, matched Celestia&#039;s memories of her student. &quot;You claim to be Sunset Shimmer?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess? Is that you? You&#039;re one of them too?&quot; The voice was also that of Sunset Shimmer. &quot;What&#039;s going on? Why is everyone... whatever you are? What happened while I was gone?&quot; The wide-eyed confusion seemed honest.</p><p class="double">Steeling herself, Celestia asked her most crucial question. &quot;Sunset, what species are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m a human.&quot; Sunset&#039;s manner now seemed to convey a combination of fear and worry. &quot;Princess, please tell me, what happened?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">They galloped towards the room containing the mirror portal. It was Celestia&#039;s hope that there was something on the other side that could break Discord&#039;s enchantment on herself, and from there she could aid her subjects.</p><p class="double">Celestia had to check her speed several times, during the run, as Sunset&#039;s human form could not keep up with her. Though she had offered, it seemed Sunset thought it would be too disrespectful to ride on Celestia&#039;s back.</p><p class="double">As they came to the room with the Mirror, they heard the sound of nails being hammered. Entering the doorway, they saw the one being Celestia dearly hoped not to see.</p><p class="double">Shaking his hammer at a guard, Discord continued his rant. He had not yet looked to see who was at the door. &quot;I mean, sure, I&#039;ve got <i>plenty</i> of vacation time, but that doesn&#039;t mean I like getting pulled away from it! And all because somepony left a door open.&quot;</p><p class="double">Slapping another plank onto the Mirror, Discord continued talking as he hammered it into place. &quot;Think of it like your bathtub drain. Leave it open, and all the horse will leak out.&quot; Pounding the last nail home, Discord turned to look Celestia in the eye. &quot;And then I have to kill everyone.&quot;</p><p class="double">With two snaps of his fingers, Discord was gone. Breathing a quiet sigh of relief, Celestia turned to Sunset, only for her words to die in her throat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; said the goldenrod unicorn Celestia remembered, &quot;I don&#039;t think we&#039;re going through <i>that</i> portal. What did you need from the humans again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were a human.&quot; Came Celestia&#039;s shellshocked reply.</p><p class="double">&quot;What? No, I&#039;m a unicorn. I&#039;ve always been a unicorn.&quot; Sunset&#039;s brow furrowed in thought. &quot;Well, I think the portal turned me into something different, but I&#039;ve always been a unicorn... right?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.4 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">To a looper, mere deja vu was just another day at the office.</p><p class="double">Still, the details of particularly noteworthy loop beginnings did tend to stick in one&#039;s memory.</p><p class="double">Aragorn, son of Arathorn (better known in these parts as &quot;Strider&quot;) pondered the ineffable workings of the multiverse as the new loop formed around him.</p><p class="double">Another &quot;late&quot; Prancing Pony start.</p><p class="double">The usual semi-panicked discussion between Butterbur and the hobbits regarding transportation.</p><p class="double">At least the pony appeared to be just plain Bill this time around.</p><p class="double">The bright magenta flash, on the other hand...</p><p class="double">&quot;See? Ya won&#039;t know fer sure &#039;til ya try,&quot; the youthful woman told the great lavender winged unicorn after the two had suddenly appeared in the courtyard. She was wearing familiar gray robes and held a staff. Her straw-blonde hair was tied back in a simple ponytail.</p><p class="double">But her hat was definitely not the large pointed one associated with wizards across the multiverse. It was a more modest well-worn brown stetson he had seen in previous loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;This&#039;ll make things a whole lot easier,&quot; she continued, then turned to look at the others in the courtyard. &quot;Heya, Aragorn! Looks like me and Twilight are replacing Gandalf and Shadowfax this time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll say it again, Applejack,&quot; commented the alicorn. &quot;I don&#039;t need to be Rarity to know that hat just doesn&#039;t go with those robes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is this one of those &#039;Talking Pony&#039; variants I&#039;ve been hearing about?&quot; Sam asked while the other hobbits gawked at the newcomers. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.5 (Bardic Knowledge)</p><p class="double">Applejack looked to her &quot;brother&quot; this Loop. He was as big as Big Mac, but he was grey with a white mane in a corn-row style. His cutie mark retained Big Mac&#039;s half apple, but there was an addition of a blade, giving the impression of having cut it in half.</p><p class="double">&quot;It seems I have become a horse,&quot; the newcomer said flatly to himself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pony,&quot; corrected Applejack. &quot;We can be a mite bit touchy on the proper name.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Understood.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Applejack by the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sten. Though the Loop memories tell me that I&#039;m called Big Slicer.&quot; Applejack nodded, then filled him in on Equestria&#039;s usual operations. Later, they discovered another Looper, whom Sten had apparently met before.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sten.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wrex.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know what&#039;s weird about this one?&quot; said the former Krogan.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aside from you being a small rabbit?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, besides that. From what I hear, the rabbit could be an honorary Krogan!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile, in another Loop...</p><p class="double">Shepard was both amused and surprised to find Wrex had been replaced, as his replacement was a white Krogan who only seemed to speak in sign language and had introduced himself as &quot;Angel.&quot; However, Angel&#039;s ability to leap around the battlefield dispensing pain with a carrot-shaped rocket launcher was far too amusing to leave him on the ship. Ever. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.6(Bardic Knowledge)</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in a bizarre, twisted landscape. The rest of the main Elements of Harmony stood around her, somehow in a combination of Rainbow Power and Alicorn modes. &quot;Anyone know where we are?&quot; she asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It feels kinda familiar,&quot; said Pinkie. &quot;But I&#039;m not sure how...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can answer that question!&quot; said a familiar voice from above. Discord the emerged from the floor, upside down umbrella in claw. &quot;Welcome to the Fade!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Fade?&quot; asked Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;Realm of dreams in Thedas, the world of Dragon Age. It&#039;s also the afterlife.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then why are we here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I come here fairly often, relatively speaking,&quot; said Discord, buffing a paw on an outcropping of water, &quot;and Warden, the local Anchor, has decided that it&#039;s because I&#039;m the &#039;Spirit of Chaos.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded in understanding. &quot;And we&#039;re the spirits of the Elements of Harmony.&quot;</p><p class="double">A car horn sounded as Discord snapped his fingers, &quot;Got it in one!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.7&nbsp;&nbsp;(The One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;That is strange, I don&#039;t taste any meringue.&quot; Twilight commented just before jumping a foot in the air.</p><p class="double">&quot;I GOT YOU NOW!&quot; Pinkie Pie shouted while jumping out from behind a flowerpot.</p><p class="double">&quot;I knew it, I knew it! I! KNEW! IT!&quot; She accused. &quot;The strange scheduling, the weird sleeping habits, the fact that even though you are supposedly good friends and we all saved Equestria together lots of times YOU ARE NEVER SEEN TOGETHER!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie was panting by now. &quot;Well, hold it right there sugarcube. Is this your weird &#039;Twilight Sparkle is secretly Rarity in a costume&#039; thing?&quot; Applejack asked deadpan.</p><p class="double">&quot;IT&#039;S NOT A THING! I mean, yes it is, but ARGH!&quot; Pinkie groaned in frustration. &quot;I invented these awesome Pony costumes and then I noticed that Twilight always smelled like the special hornpolish! And we DO never see Rarity and Twilight together. AND NOW! You just said that there was meringue in that Cupcake, but THAT IS NOT TRUE! That is a lie I told Rarity to RAT YOU OUT!&quot; with that she took a bucket of Polish remover and upended it over Twilight&#039;s head.</p><p class="double">Nothing.</p><p class="double">When she began tugging and tearing at Twilight&#039;s mane she thought enough is enough. &quot;PINKIE!&quot; She used her Telekinesis to pin Pinkie Pie the pink Party Pony to the wall. Her eyes widened when she saw Pinkie had a knife.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, okay, okay, YES, me and Rarity have been one and the same Pony for a while now.&quot; Twilight gave up.</p><p class="double">&quot;AHA! I knew there couldn&#039;t be such a Pony! Special Talent is Magic? What a hoax, all special talents are Magic! Super duper powerful? The Princess&#039; Student? Ascended to Alicorn?!? And what kind of ridiculous name is Twilight Sparkle? A teenager&#039;s idea of a sorry excuse for a Vampony? You should have invented a better story than that, Rarity!&quot; shouted Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">Twilight pulled her Rarity costume out of her subspace pocket. &quot;I used a spell to hide the smell of the Hornpolish, but I guess it lingered after I shed and dispelled my disguise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s jaw completed it&#039;s journey. &quot;But... but I knew Rarity nearly her whole life! Big Mac foalsat for her!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie was quicker on the uptake: &quot;What did you do with the real Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She asked me to cover for her while she eloped with a Dragon.&quot; Twilight deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, okay!&quot; Smiled Pinkie Pie and hopped out of the room, forgetting the fact that she was still pinned to a wall.</p><p class="double">All was right again.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile, far away a certain Unicorn got a shiver down her back and had a strange premonition of remedial Birthday Parties. She snuggled into her lover&#039;s scaly chest and dismissed the feeling. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.8 </p><p class="double">“Silver Spoon!” Cheerilee said, frowning. “What do you have to say for yourself, young mare?”</p><p class="double">The earth pony looked at her teacher as she put her satchel down. “What is it, Miss?”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re very late to school!” Cheerilee pointed out the window. “It&#039;s nearly noon!”</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon looked out the window as well, idly tapping a hoof on the floor. “No it isn&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee took a moment to reply to that. “Young mare, that is not-”</p><p class="double">“Hey, why&#039;s it dark outside?” asked Snips, talking over the top of her.</p><p class="double">“-the appropriate-!” Cheerilee broke off, and gaped. “What the-”</p><p class="double">The sun was barely peeking over the edge of the rooftops, with warm dawn light slowly suffusing the town.</p><p class="double">“But...” Cheerilee closed her eyes, shook her head, and opened them again. “We don&#039;t have... okay. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s going on here, but... I apologize for thinking you were late, I suppose. Now, go sit down.”</p><p class="double">“Okay!”</p><p class="double">Silver flipped her long, bushy tail aside, and sat. Then she raised her hoof. “Miss?”</p><p class="double">“What is it, Silver?” Cheerilee asked, turning.</p><p class="double">“Can we go home? It&#039;s already sunset!”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee slowly turned from the board to look out the eastern windows, which were dark.</p><p class="double">Then she looked at the western window, which had a red sun slowly sinking behind a hill.</p><p class="double">“...okay, fine. I don&#039;t even know what&#039;s going on any more...”</p><p class="double">Fillies and colts poured out of the building, not wanting to miss a good thing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” Discord asked, dangling from a tree. “Didn&#039;t feel like school today?”</p><p class="double">“Not especially, no,” Silver confirmed. “By the way, it&#039;s nice of you and Berry to take me in this time. Now that my Dad&#039;s vanished as well this loop, and all.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, pish tosh.” Discord shrugged an upside down shrug, which inexplicably resulted in him falling sideways into the tree trunk with a <i>thud</i>. “For all I know, we may <i>be</i> your parents. You are a draconequus, after all.”</p><p class="double">“But...” Silver blinked. “I could swear you only got out of the statue last...”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “Never mind. Like you keep saying,”</p><p class="double">“Draconequui don&#039;t make sense, it&#039;s boring,” they chorused.</p><p class="double">“Speaking of which, one crumpet or two?” Discord added.</p><p class="double">“Just one for me, thanks.” Silver accepted the plate of breakfast, and began to eat as the sun set. “How&#039;s Ruby been today?”</p><p class="double">“Confused,” Discord replied. “But chipper. She gave me a paper note which was redeemable for one hug. I&#039;m thinking of saving them up...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.9</p><p class="double">Captain Jean-Luc Picard blinked, as he Awoke into a new loop.</p><p class="double">His thought process went through two very quick realizations.</p><p class="double">First: <i>Oh, back to normal.</i> (It was something of a relief, in some ways, after that loop in the Republic of Haven.)</p><p class="double">Second: <i>Ah, tabernacale. The borg.</p><p class="double"></i>Whether by random chance or connivance of Q (Picard didn&#039;t trust anything he said on principle, especially about things he couldn&#039;t do), he&#039;d just Awoken about three seconds before the Borg started implanting things into him back at J-25.</p><p class="double">Picard spent the few seconds he had practising a Talaxian technique for emptying the mind of everything one did not want to remember. Normal Borg were bad enough – Borg with knowledge of the future were... terrifying.</p><p class="double">When the expected pain of implantation did not occur, Picard opened one eye cautiously. Then the other, and looked around in confusion.</p><p class="double">The drones were standing back around the room he was in, in a fair semblance of parade rest. The equipment that had been about to get to work on him lay scattered all over the floor.</p><p class="double">Then a screen lit.</p><p class="double">A woman appeared upon it. She was seated, wearing a long, slinky black-and-green dress and a small black coronet – one which did not conceal the Borg implants around the orbit of her left eye, on her right cheekbone, and along the line of her lower jaw on both sides.</p><p class="double">“I am the Borg,” she began, a smirk curling her lips. “Our biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to your own. Resistance is irrelevant, we are applying for citizenship.”</p><p class="double">Picard felt almost aggrieved by the whole situation.</p><p class="double">“Who are you?” he asked. “Somehow I doubt the Borg that I know would act like this.”</p><p class="double">“Dear me, Picard,” she said, shaking her head. “You don&#039;t recognize me? Here&#039;s a clue.”</p><p class="double">The Cube Picard was on shook slightly, and he glanced away from the screen.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry,” the woman commented. “I&#039;ve strengthened the shields to maximum, and I&#039;m not firing back. Anyway, here&#039;s the clue. I&#039;m sorry for calling you away from your fish dish, but I really felt quite strongly that there were five lights.”</p><p class="double">With that, everything fell into place.</p><p class="double">“You are... Chrysalis?” he checked.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right, Captain,” Chrysalis replied. “It feels all very familiar – I make something of a career out of running a nice little hive mind back home, though this one&#039;s just a bit bigger – and I&#039;ve already instituted reforms.”</p><p class="double">Picard raised an eyebrow, in the way he&#039;d seen Vulcans practising in front of mirrors. The restraints hissed and let him go, and he stood up and walked forward a bit. “Reforms?”</p><p class="double">“Assimilation is now entirely voluntary. Drones can leave if they want. The Federation&#039;s about to get a very large box containing all the interesting scientific stuff I&#039;m willing to let within ten thousand light years of Section 31, and I meant it about applying for citizenship.”</p><p class="double">After a moment, Picard worked though the implications of that last one, and felt a headache coming on. “So you mean... the Borg are going to apply to immigrate into the Federation?”</p><p class="double">“Not quite. More... <i>join</i> it.” Chrysalis made an expansive gesture. “I rather like the idea of the hive trying to parse the Prime Directive, especially with how often Fleet captains have bent it into a pretzel.”</p><p class="double">“We do not speak of Archer,” Picard quipped.</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Chrysalis&#039; eyes unfocused for a moment. “Oh, dear, your ship is getting very insistent. Hold on a minute.”</p><p class="double">The Cube shuddered for a moment.</p><p class="double">“What did you just do?” Picard asked.</p><p class="double">“Set course directly for Risa and started broadcasting loud music on all frequencies.” The Borg Queen&#039;s expression was like a cat that had gotten into the cream. “I look forward to hearing you explain that it was <i>not</i> your assimilation that set an entire Borg ship on a direct course for booty. Coincidentally, I just found where my girlfriend&#039;s hiding this loop.”</p><p class="double">With that, the connection closed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Patricia Hansen looked over the jumpsuit dubiously. “Really?”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shrugged. “It&#039;s what you&#039;re supposed to be wearing.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m barely sixteen, Chrissy.” Trixie shook her head. “I think I&#039;m going to stick with the Borg suit. It&#039;s less revealing. Now, what was it you were saying?”</p><p class="double">“Two things, mainly.” Chrysalis shrugged. “First, you&#039;re now a Primary adjunct of Unimatrix 01 – or, in other words, my secretary – and second, I found how to make an imperfect Omega particle.”</p><p class="double">Trixie searched her encyclopaedic memory of ways to make thing go boom, and a grin spread across her face.</p><p class="double">“Fireworks the size of a supergiant star?”</p><p class="double">“Fireworks the size of a supergiant star.”</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>108.1</p><p class="double">“Oy, cousin!” Gilda shouted, kicking down the door of the Gryphon Throne Room. “Clear out these tossers, we&#039;ve got business.”</p><p class="double">“Sod off, Gilda,” the Emperor of the Gryphons replied, flicking a two-talon salute at her without looking. “I&#039;m busy.”</p><p class="double">Gilda gave the – rather scrawny – petitioners a glance. Then traipsed around behind them, peered over the shoulder of one at his notes, and elbowed him. “Oi.”</p><p class="double">“What?” the scholarly gryphon replied, bristling, and his friend reached for a pair of sabres in cross-draw scabbards.</p><p class="double">The element of honesty dropped a bag on the floor. It cracked the paving slab. “Here. Cash. Go implement it, it&#039;ll be cool.”</p><p class="double">The scholar looked from her to the bag, then nodded, and picked it up – not without considerable effort.</p><p class="double">With his friend helping, they left in haste.</p><p class="double">“Busy now?” Gilda asked.</p><p class="double">“Not especially, no.” The Emperor lay back on his throne. “What is it? Need money?”</p><p class="double">Gilda gave him a look. “I just gave twenty pounds of solid gold to someone wanting to build a geology museum. I am on an expense account you would not believe.”</p><p class="double">“Not gold then...” the Emperor sighed. “Did I forget your birthday?”</p><p class="double">“Three times in the past seven years, but that&#039;s not the point. The point is,” Gilda made a grand gesture. “I challenge you to a duel!”</p><p class="double">The Emperor blinked, then shifted on his throne. His muscles tensed, subtly. “Did you make an appointment?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, just beat up all your guards.” She tossed him a leather wallet. “Here. It&#039;s your guard captain&#039;s. He&#039;s got membership cards in eight different libraries – wonder where he finds the time...”</p><p class="double">“So, a coup then.” Another sigh. “I wouldn&#039;t have thought you as one to try a coup. I thought you liked ponies.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, speaking of that.” Gilda turned to the door. “That&#039;s your cue, flutterflank.”</p><p class="double">It creaked open, and a number of spears clattered to the floor. A gryphon that had been slumped against it also fell slowly inside, groaning.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy walked through the door, wearing gryphon-shaped armour that didn&#039;t fit. “Um... okay.”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s my new guard,” Gilda stage-whispered, then turned back to Fluttershy. “Okay, remember your lines?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, wringing her hooves.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Gilda pointed at the Emperor again. “I challenge you before the People, before the Empire, and by our shared membership in the Royal Family, for your office and all that it represents.”</p><p class="double">“I accept,” the Emperor replied formally. “And I say – until the first gryphon yields, or falls unconscious and can battle no more.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy raised a hoof. “Er... by right of my position as arms-pony of Gilda, challenger in this duel, I take her place and stand before her.”</p><p class="double">The Emperor couldn&#039;t help but snigger. “Very well. I will beat your... guard... in your place. Seriously, Gilda, you&#039;ve gone soft...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, whatever.” Gilda stepped back. “Go easy on him, Flutters.” A pause. “Relatively easy.” Another pause. “Well, you know, don&#039;t maim him or anything.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, giving off a little squeak noise. Then turned to the Emperor, and abruptly transformed into a forty-foot-tall <i>Tyrannosaurus Rex.</i></p><p class="double">“Roar,” it said courteously.</p><p class="double">“...huh,” the Emperor said, distantly. “Never knew they could do that.”</p><p class="double">“Flutters is kinda talented,” Gilda replied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And, by right of conquest, we crown thee Empress of the Gryphons.”</p><p class="double">The upper council of dukes bowed.</p><p class="double">“What is your first command, my liege?” asked the Grand Duke of the Central Plains.</p><p class="double">“Um... can I have some mint tea, please?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gilda sniggered. “I&#039;ve been trying to get that to work for <i>so</i> long.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” the former Emperor asked, checking his side for bruises. “It looks like your guard just knocked you out as well as me.”</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah, my original plan was to get Flutters on the throne.” Gilda shrugged. “The tricky bit was doing it <i>legally.</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.2</p><p class="double">“Here you go, dear,” Spike announced, revealing from behind his back a bale of cloth.</p><p class="double">“Um... thank you, Spike,” Rarity replied. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s Weave.” Spike held it out. “Go on, try it.”</p><p class="double">Rarity held out a hoof, and let a trailing edge of the cloth play over her foreleg. “It... feels most peculiar. What-” she paused.</p><p class="double">“Did you call it Weave?” she asked, horn lighting up.</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Spike grinned.</p><p class="double">“...it&#039;s the original weft, as well,” she breathed, a potent scrying spell backscattering rainbow light across her muzzle. “How on Faerun did you get this?”</p><p class="double">“Eh.” Spike shrugged. “I did Midnight a favour, she got me some of Mystryl&#039;s original. Turns out a Great Wyrm is <i>really</i> useful during the interregnum.”</p><p class="double">Rarity felt the soft material again, holding it up to the light to let it iridesce in the glare of Celestia&#039;s sun. “Well, well. I can see many possibilities for this. What&#039;s the occasion?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s your one-hundred-millionth loop!” the purple dragon announced.</p><p class="double">His wife frowned at him. “...I doubt that.”</p><p class="double">“Unless you can prove otherwise, I&#039;m maintaining that it is,” Spike countered.</p><p class="double">Rarity put the Weave down carefully, trotted over and poked him – eliciting a giggle. “You just wanted to do something nice for me, didn&#039;t you?”</p><p class="double">“I admit nothing-”</p><p class="double">Rarity poked him again. This time he giggled a bit louder.</p><p class="double">“I know exactly where you&#039;re ticklish, Spike, this isn&#039;t going to end well for you!” Rarity announced, smiling broadly herself.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll never talk!”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t count on it.” Rarity tensed, then pounced, and delighted laughter rang through the Boutique.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...yeah, I&#039;m thinking we go to your place, &#039;Bloom,” Sweetie Belle said apologetically, lowering her hoof from the door knocker. “Best to leave those two to it.”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” the earth pony filly agreed readily, and both of them traipsed back over to Scootaloo&#039;s cart.</p><p class="double">“We really need to get the clubhouse built,” Scootaloo volunteered, as she kicked off. “What&#039;s keeping you, AB?”</p><p class="double">“I want this one to have an escalator. Made entirely of wood.” Applebloom shrugged. “It&#039;s a project.”</p><p class="double">“Hasn&#039;t that been done?” Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">“Nah. I mean the engine, too.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.3</p><p class="double">Bilbo Baggins sighed. “Okay, what this time?”</p><p class="double">The tall woman wearing a travelling cloak winked at him. “I am Leah the Clear, and I wish to recruit you on a-”</p><p class="double">“Yes, yes, we&#039;ve all been here before.” Bilbo opened the door fully. “I assume you&#039;re an Anchor?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Leah walked in, and put her staff down. “Nice place.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” Bilbo replied. “Tea?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, yes <i>please.</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” Bilbo asked, some time later. “What else is different? Or have you not gotten word yet?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I have.” Leah smiled mysteriously. “I invited them early, by the way.”</p><p class="double">The door thudded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hi,” a short, cloaked figure said. “I&#039;m Spike, and he&#039;s Storm.”</p><p class="double">The other figure waved.</p><p class="double">Throwing back their cloaks, the two small dragons made a bee-line for Bilbo&#039;s pantry.</p><p class="double">The Hobbit sighed. He was used to it, really he was... it&#039;s just that it got trying, sometimes.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Toothless and Draycos,” the next pair introduced themselves. “We heard there was food?”</p><p class="double">“But we already ate,” Draycos added.</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Bilbo blinked. “That&#039;s... actually quite a new experience.”</p><p class="double">“We wouldn&#039;t say no to dessert, though...”</p><p class="double">“Of course you wouldn&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t worry!” Leah&#039;s voice drifted through the building. “I&#039;ve got some spare in my pocket!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Anne,”</p><p class="double">“Julian,”</p><p class="double">“And I&#039;m Dick,” the last of the three added. “I say, your manners are impeccable!”</p><p class="double">“Why, thank you,” Bilbo allowed. “I do try.”</p><p class="double">“Just tea for us,” Anne added. “It wouldn&#039;t be polite to impose.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Pray, allow us to enter your fine abode, sir,” the ninth visitor asked, gesturing to his two companions. “I am Corporal Temeraire, and these are Saphira and Spyro.”</p><p class="double">“The one who&#039;s not a jerk,” Spyro supplied.</p><p class="double">“Actually, that doesn&#039;t help tell you apart in the slightest,” Saphira pointed out, chuckling.</p><p class="double">“...fine, then. Come in come in...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Bilbo finally got a chance to head to the table, it was to see one werewolf-mage and a round dozen dragons around the table.</p><p class="double">“Er...” he muttered under his breath. “I think I missed letting you two in...”</p><p class="double"><i>We let ourselves in,</i> a mellifluous mental voice supplied. <i>I am Mnementh, and my compatriot is Ninereeds.</i></p><p class="double">“You know,” Bilbo said, mostly to the air. “I&#039;m getting a sinking feeling about this...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Evening, little hobbit,” the final arrival said. “So, this is where you live.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t torch it next time,” Bilbo warned. “Or I&#039;ll get Gandalf to flood your lair.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t be so confrontational,” Smaug Golden-Scale smiled. “We&#039;re all allies here.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, about that...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And so,” Leah concluded, spoiling the effect a bit with a giggling fit, “these thirteen drakes-”</p><p class="double">“<i>Twelve</i> drakes,” Saphira interrupted.</p><p class="double">“My apologies... <i>twelve</i> drakes and one dragoness were thrown out of their lair by... this.”</p><p class="double">Leah put a picture on the table.</p><p class="double">Bilbo stared for a moment. “...you have got to be having me on.”</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s all true,” Spike supplied, sniggering himself. “Thirteen dragons thrown out of Erebor by a gigantic mecha-dwarf.”</p><p class="double">After a few more seconds, Bilbo turned around. “I&#039;m going back to bed.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.4</p><p class="double">“Show me another one!” Scootaloo begged.</p><p class="double">“Certainly.” The adult pegasus fumbled for a moment, then an aircraft of about 30 feet of wingspan bounced down to the floor next to him.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo jumped forward, wings whirring, and tapped the skin. “Stressed metal...”</p><p class="double">She inspected the aircraft from all angles. The propeller was noted,&nbsp;&nbsp;the propeller-hub 20mm cannon and pair of 20mm wing cannons raised an eyebrow, and the engine made her blink.</p><p class="double">“Is this a Griffon?” she asked, muzzle half into the inspection panel.</p><p class="double">“Almost.” The tan pegasus smiled enigmatically. “Any thoughts?”</p><p class="double">“Only that you&#039;ve clearly been messing around with history.” Scootaloo hopped up to check on the cockpit, and gaped.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s aerial interception radar!”</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded. “Yep. And check the wing chord.”</p><p class="double">She duly did so.</p><p class="double">“Elliptical...” The young Element of Loyalty shook her head. “This thing&#039;s got <i>so</i> many of the design elements of a Spitfire that I&#039;m almost tempted to say that it&#039;s one of those... but it&#039;s clearly not. I know spits, and this isn&#039;t a spit.”</p><p class="double">“Correcte. C&#039;est une S-D 200 &#039;Shrike&#039; Supermarine-Dewoitine.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo blinked. “The only bit of that I understood was the word Supermarine.” A pause. “And since when did you speak French willingly, Biggles?”</p><p class="double">She peered down the side of the Shrike. “And... what the bramble is that roundel? And I don&#039;t even know what the hay&#039;s up with the <i>flag.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well.” The stallion coughed. “I <i>may</i> have discovered how to get the proposal of 16 June 1940 to be accepted nine times out of ten.”</p><p class="double">The filly just gave him a look. “That might mean something to human loopers, but we&#039;re <i>ponies</i>. We&#039;re usually too busy being human to go to history class much.”</p><p class="double">“No, that&#039;s quite alright. Actually, no-one&#039;s ever heard of it.” Biggles shrugged. “Long story short, when France was collapsing in 1940, Parliament offered to join the British and French nations into one union.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo fell out of the plane.</p><p class="double">“I know!” Biggles grinned, helping her up. “Everyone does that. Anyway, that&#039;s where this comes from. It&#039;s a model used in the libération in 1943.”</p><p class="double">“...okay, yeah, you probably win this round.” Scootaloo tapped a hoof on the ground. “Okay, next one. Strangest way of using an aircraft you&#039;ve seen.”</p><p class="double">Biggles frowned, thinking. “I <i>did</i> see a jet biplane with reinforced wings used to cut power cables once...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.5:</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked up at her friend.</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is a new one even for you.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d noticed,” Silver replied, loudly. She couldn&#039;t help it – her current body did everything loudly.</p><p class="double">“Why don&#039;t you just... you know, shapeshift?”</p><p class="double">“&#039;cause I&#039;ve been going to the school like this for five months. I&#039;d actually be more conspicuous if I changed <i>away</i> from it.” Silver shrugged.</p><p class="double">The bell rang, interrupting their discussion.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay...” Cheerilee looked down at the register. “Scootaloo?”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">“Silver?”</p><p class="double">A blast of sound that made the windows ring. Inside it could be distinguished a voice saying &#039;here&#039;.</p><p class="double">“Snails?”</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">The register continued without further incident.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t even know <i>what</i> the logic is for you being a <i>Parasaurolophus</i>,” Nyx observed that evening over Crusader Cupcakes.</p><p class="double">“I think I managed to work it out, actually,” Sweetie volunteered.</p><p class="double">Silver looked up from her cupcake (dozens of times the size of those for anyone else, on account of her body mass.) “Really?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Duck-billed dinosaurs are kind of misnamed. They actually have spoon-shaped beaks.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Silver concentrated, erupted in light, and reformed as a draconequus. “I refuse to be a living pun.”</p><p class="double">“Plus,” Diamond Tiara added, pointing. “You now have more cake than actual you.”</p><p class="double">“That may have been a factor.” Silver shrugged, then headed cakewards.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.6</p><p class="double">“Ah, hello Lyra,” Twilight began, approaching her. “It&#039;s taken a while for me to find you.”</p><p class="double">“Looking in the wrong place?” Lyra asked.</p><p class="double">“More like the wrong loop, actually.” Twilight shrugged. “I know it was just last time around as far as you&#039;re concerned, but for me it can actually be quite a long time.”</p><p class="double">“Fair enough.” Lyra shrugged. “So, what you got?”</p><p class="double">Twilight paused slightly. “I assume I&#039;m talking to the mad scientist?”</p><p class="double">“Why does <i>everyone</i> call me that?” Lyra asked, exasperated. “I&#039;m not <i>that</i> crazy...”</p><p class="double">Twilight coughed. “Maybe not by Trixie standards, but that&#039;s still not precisely <i>sane</i>. Besides, with her it&#039;s partly an act.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, point taken.” Lyra winced. “Is it possible to win an argument with you?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight replied simply.</p><p class="double">“...walked into that one... okay. What was it you wanted.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight took a breath. “Lyra. If the option became available for you to become an alicorn, would you take it?”</p><p class="double">Lyra blinked. “Whoo, that&#039;s a big question. I&#039;m... not sure, actually. Can you give me more information?”</p><p class="double">She looked at Twilight, just to see if – despite her large subspace pocket – the other unicorn was somehow concealing an alicornification machine behind her back. “Is this a now-or-never thing, or what?”</p><p class="double">“Oh!” Twilight shook her head. “No, it&#039;s not something that&#039;s got a time limit. It&#039;s not really something that&#039;s got a <i>time,</i> per se. It&#039;s more... if the option comes up for me to steer you into ascending, do I take the option or not?”</p><p class="double">She tossed her head. “I like to make sure that things like that have the full consent of the pony in question.”</p><p class="double">“Right, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold on a sec.”</p><p class="double">Twilight waited patiently.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, what do you think?” the sea pony asked. “I don&#039;t know, myself...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, it&#039;s a big step,” the unicorn agreed. “I... I think it wouldn&#039;t be a good idea, at least not yet, because we&#039;re still feeling our way into being <i>us</i> in the first place. And, well, as far as I can tell becoming an alicorn would mean I&#039;d be the one affected.”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “I wouldn&#039;t want that.”</p><p class="double">“Huh, interesting view,” the &#039;other&#039; one said. “I don&#039;t know, really... what about you?”</p><p class="double">“Be a <i>winged</i> unicorn pony?” the human asked. “I think it&#039;d be awesome!”</p><p class="double">The other three rolled their eyes.</p><p class="double">“Seriously, though,” she said, jumping down off the &#039;bed&#039; in their shared mindscape. “I&#039;m all for it. It&#039;s not a joke, I know that, but I think it&#039;d be a useful experience that might help to reconcile our personalities.”</p><p class="double">“Now, see,” the sea pony said. “I don&#039;t know if I <i>want</i> us to reconcile our personalities, at least right now. I&#039;m... just not sure. But...” she thrashed her flippers, sending metawater everywhere. “I <i>like</i> you guys, and I like having me to talk to. I&#039;m not sure how we&#039;d cope if we were one personality again, to be honest...”</p><p class="double">The unicorn nodded. “Good point.”</p><p class="double">The one currently in charge of their shared body looked around at them. “No consensus, I take it?”</p><p class="double">“Looks like not,” the sea pony confirmed.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Vote?”</p><p class="double">“For,” the human girl said.</p><p class="double">“Against,” the sea pony replied.</p><p class="double">“...I guess, yeah, mermare&#039;s got a point, and I was thinking that way anyway. Against,” the unicorn said.</p><p class="double">“And I genuinely don&#039;t know,” the miscellaneous Lyra finished. “Okay. I&#039;ll let Twilight know.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m in three minds about it,” Lyra informed her. “The one who says yes is outnumbered three to one, though.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight nodded. “I&#039;ll remember that. The offer remains open, though.”</p><p class="double">“I figured, thanks.” Lyra paused. “Hey, how would it work if I said yes, anyway?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “I&#039;d wait long enough it wasn&#039;t in the front of your mind any more, then try to get you, a major adventure and an Element or other catalyst in the same place at the same time. And yes, it has to be a long time, because if you&#039;re trying it doesn&#039;t work.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Lyra absorbed that. “Interesting...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Twilight trotted into her Canterlot tower library, ready to begin another baseline Loop. &quot;Spike! Spiiiike!&quot;</p><p class="double">A purple dog with green fur on its ears scrambled up to her, tail wagging furiously.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... what? Spike?&quot;</p><p class="double">The dog barked happily, bouncing up to greet his mistress.</p><p class="double">&quot;O.... kay. My assistant is a dog, and not Awake this Loop.&quot; Twilight took a moment to run her hoof through doggy Spike&#039;s fur. &quot;I should learn to check Loop memories even in baseline Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I beg your pardon, Mistress Twilight.&quot; The voice was a bit high-pitched, refined, and had a musical accent to it. &quot;I thought you might have wanted me for something, but I see you were just greeting dear little Spike.&quot; A dragon waddled out from a side room bearing a birthday gift. Unlike Spike, this dragon was brown, nearly spherical, wearing a cardigan, and looking through pince-nez glasses perched on the tiny beaklike muzzle that clung to his large, broad face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... Ah... Owlowiscious?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash leaned against the gargantuan bulk of the green elder dragon and shrugged. &quot;Yeah, all our pets are dragons this Loop. Of course Tank couldn&#039;t get much more awesome anyway, but I think he&#039;s enjoying himself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, we&#039;ve never got confirmation that he&#039;s Looping,&quot; Twilight pointed out.</p><p class="double">The smile on Tank&#039;s immense beak made the Mona Lisa look naif. His vocabulary made Big Mac look garrulous. Twilight decided not to waste her time trying and failing to get the lowdown now.</p><p class="double">Rarity sat to a long, slender white wyrm who stared at the other ponies and dragons with silent disdain. &quot;Perhaps not all of our pets have changed. Gummy doesn&#039;t look any different.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you mean, he doesn&#039;t look different? Isn&#039;t it obvious?&quot; Pinkie Pie pointed dramatically at Gummy&#039;s forelegs. &quot;Gummy&#039;s thumbs are a whole quarter inch larger!&quot;</p><p class="double">Gummy blinked his wall-eyed blink, shook, and belched out a brief fireball.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Pinkie added offhandedly, &quot;and there&#039;s also that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m late,&quot; Fluttershy murmured, walking up with a picnic basket on her back. &quot;I had to get the birds to finish their rehearsal quickly so we could have this meeting. And then Angel-&quot;</p><p class="double">The white dragon accompanying Fluttershy was more or less shaped like Spike, except for long, tall ear ridges instead of Spike&#039;s smaller ones. &quot;THERE YOU ARE!&quot; he shouted. &quot;You have NO IDEA how long I&#039;ve been waiting for this day! Would you like to guess how many HUNDRED THOUSAND LOOPS it&#039;s been since I had one where I could TALK?&quot; The Looping bunny-turned-dragon cracked his knuckles and grinned a buck-toothed grin. &quot;Sit down and get comfortable, jerks, because I&#039;ve got a LOT of things I&#039;ve been saving up to tell you...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You know, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard of a Loop being crashed by sheer profanity before.&quot; Twilight sipped her drink and contemplated the astounding synergy of curses, maledicta, obscenities and f-bombs (and c-bombs, d-bombs, s-bombs, and in fact every letter from a to z-bombs) that had destroyed what looked like a fascinating Loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m sure Angel has learned his lesson,&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;He&#039;s going this entire loop without the cherry on top of his salads. No cherries for potty-mouths.&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny, seated between Fluttershy&#039;s forehooves, crossed his forelegs and sulked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, do stop sulking and drink your Shirley Temple.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.8 (Snakes Shadow)</p><p class="double">Twilight, as per normal, Awoke in front of her book in the gardens of Canterlot. She was about to check her loop memories when her book caught her eye. It wasn&#039;t the normal book on Equestrian mythologies. It was a history of Equestria, and open to a timeline. 1500 years ago was the defeat of Discord. 1000 years (Minus a few days) was the banishment of Luna as Nightmare Moon. 800 years ago, The Plague started. The line for the plague continued to the current day.</p><p class="double">Twilight checked her Loop memories. The Plague had an unknown source, but was magical in nature. It seemed to invade through a pony&#039;s cutie mark, warping the pony&#039;s special talent, driving them insane and eventually causing their death. Celestia <i>had</i> found a stop-gap measure: a cutie mark suppressor spell, much like the branding spell used by Celestia in that horrible slaver Equestria loop but without punishment triggers or additional mental effects, blocked the acquisition of a cutie mark thus preventing the plague from attacking the pony, yet still allowed active use of a pony&#039;s special talent. It wore heavily on Celestia, however. Hundreds of unicorns had the task of raising the sun and moon because Celestia could not.</p><p class="double">Twilight walked to her rooms, deep in thought. She was so deep in thought, she managed to trip over an invisible seam in the carpeting, crashing to the floor outside of the council chambers. She stood up and was about to continue on her way when Celestia&#039;s thundering use of The Royal Canterlot Voice passed clearly through the closed doors.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>She hatched a dragonet from a </b><i><b>DEAD</b><b> Dragon&#039;s egg! If anyone can end this plague, it </b><b>WILL</b><b> be her!</b></i>&quot; Then nothing. Celestia must have gone back to a more normal tone of voice. ...Wait, Spike&#039;s egg was dead in this loop? She had to check something.</p><p class="double">Twilight made a mad dash for her rooms.</p><p>&quot;Spike! SPIKE! Where are you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Over here, Twi! Why didn&#039;t you send out a ping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Too busy! Where&#039;s that information on Princess Cadence?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Umm... Here. Why?&quot; Spike handed Twilight a slim sheaf of paper. She immediately looked through it, searching for the information she needed. There!</p><p class="double">&quot;We are in a baseline loop with one exception, a plague that started eight <i>hundred</i> years ago. The only pony to survive the plague un-branded was Princess Cadence, who ascended into alicorn-hood. It&#039;s going to take some doing, but we&#039;re going to make every single pony on this world into an alicorn. Hopefully at the same time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Only then did Twilight check for other loopers. With the exception of Celestia and Luna, everyone was there. Good. Then she cast a spell that hopefully would tell her if there were any guest loopers. ...Nothing. Twilight honestly hoped that there were no visiting loopers, because this one was going to suck until she got everyone to ascend.</p><p class="double">Twilight then started on two plans: One to show Celestia, and one that had all of her foreknowledge. </p><p><hr></p><p class="double">108.9 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">Macintosh poked at his drink. He really didn&#039;t know what to do with this conversation, and it wasn&#039;t like he could really commiserate with a robot-armor-necklace.</p><p class="double">The hard part, he&#039;d thought, had been convincing Applebloom to part with Cookie without arousing her suspicions. In the end, he had decided to err on the side of honesty, and told her he just wanted to get to know the device.</p><p class="double">A holographic display lit up, projecting over the featureless carapace the shimmering visage of a filly that held superficial similarity to Applebloom, but with facial structures more associated with the old families of Canterlot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Does this make it easier?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that settled, Macintosh looked Cookie&#039;s avatar in the eye.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, yer a projection of tha&#039; personality that overwrote Applebloom&#039;s for that Nightmare Night loop ah&#039;ve heard so much about?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cookie nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Affirmative.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;And since then, ye&#039;ve become like an advisor to Bloom, tellin&#039; her when an idea&#039;s bad, listenin&#039; when she needs to talk, that sort of stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And, based on how it was explained to me, you&#039;re made out of a piece of Applebloom&#039;s soul, much like one of the Elements are part of who ma sister an&#039; the others are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a moment of silence, before Macintosh broke the tension with a smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you got a bit of Applebloom in ya, so I reckon that makes you an Apple, even if yer friendship with mah sister didn&#039;t. Next everyone&#039;s Awake, we&#039;ll see about gettin&#039; you a proper welcome-to-the-family party.&quot;</p><p class="double">The smile faded.</p><p class="double">&quot;But before that happens, ah want to ask you a favor, Cookie. Apple to Apple.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh continued, his voice slowly rising from a whisper to a determined enunciation that made up for lack of volume with the emotion behind it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack is fine. She&#039;s grown up, an&#039; probably more stable than ah am. She don&#039;t need me. But Applebloom&#039;s different. Or she was. She was mah *little* sister. Now, this whole time thing has got it so&#039;s she&#039;s probably ten times mah age by now. An&#039; that hurts. Ah can&#039;t always be there for Applebloom, jus&#039; bah dint of how the loops work. Ah know it&#039;s not good for me to hold her hoof every step of the way, but it&#039;s also mah responsibility to be there when she NEEDS me.&quot;</p><p class="double">There wasn&#039;t a tear in his eye. That was clearly some of the cider foam that had popped and gotten there. He wiped it away.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, ah want you to keep doin&#039; what yer doin. Be the older sibling ah can&#039;t, because I can&#039;t be sure to be there when she needs it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The silence stretched for a bit, before Cookie broke it.</p><p class="double">&quot;I will.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed. That was a relief.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mah thanks to you then.&quot;</p><p class="double">He opened his mouth to end the conversation, but closed it abruptly. He had remembered something.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, and since yer a looper too, and family besides, don&#039;t hesitate to come to me ifn&#039; you&#039;ve got problems you want to get off yer chest. Or hard drive. Or whatever you&#039;ve got.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cookie responded with a nod and a small smile. Their conversation concluded, the avatar dissolved into the shimmering fireflies associated with a dispelling hologram, the armor folded up into a necklace, and Macintosh picked Cookie off the counter and brought her outside the bar.</p><p class="double">Applebloom and her two friends were there, talking about sisters or somesuch, and as Mac strode over to the three Crusaders he flipped the necklace to his sister, who looked a bit concerned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Everythin&#039; okay Mac?&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed, not sure how to reply, until something caught his eye.</p><p class="double">It could have been a trick of the light, but he was sure he saw the gem glint just a bit, a wink made of light.</p><p class="double">A ghost of a smile played across his face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.10 (novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve got a jar of dirt!~&quot; Pinkie sang as she her way through the central of Ponyville with said jar of dirt balanced on her head while passing a confused Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know I&#039;m going to regret asking this, buy <i>why </i>do you have a jar of dirt on your head?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie stopped and turned towards Twilight, the jar staying still. &quot;Well, I was with Sparrow last loop, and after a &quot;We Captured The Black Pearl Again&quot; Party, he gave me a few of them from his Pocket. As to why it&#039;s on my head, I just felt like putting it there.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight considered this for a moment. &quot;Anything special about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope. Just a jar of dirt.&quot; Pinkie shrugged. &quot;Want one?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve got jars of dirt! Whee!~&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked on from her cloud as both Pinkie and Twilight were trotting along, jars of dirt balanced on their heads and singing about the fact that yes, they do have jars of dirt. Then she just shrugged her shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, not the strangest thing I&#039;ve seen them do.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.11 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double">Trixie opened the door to her wagon with a sultry smile. It was her first night in Ponyville for the Loop and, even though Chrysalis usually joined her on the road, it wasn&#039;t unheard of for her to get caught up in hive politics for a few days.</p><p class="double">Her expression froze as she saw the grey pegasus waiting outside. She blinked once, and then again. Nope, still Derpy. Her marefriend would occasionally pull something like this, but she liked to think she&#039;d gotten a handle on the Changeling Queen&#039;s tells over the course of their relationship. Unless she&#039;d been practicing this disguise in particular for awhile, it probably wasn&#039;t her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Um, hi, Derpy,&quot; she said after reassuring herself that it really wasn&#039;t a shapeshifter making a late night call.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hiya Trixie!&quot; The pegasus answered, glossing over the awkward silence with typical cheer. &quot;You wanted to talk to me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I did? I... Oh, oh, right! You got my message, then?&quot; The Equestrian Loopers had taken to mentioning anything they wanted to get to Derpy to her unawake self. It didn&#039;t always work, because there was no guarantee she&#039;d remember a specific Loop, or remember them in the right order. It was, however, the only alternative to using Twilight as the Loop&#039;s de facto answering machine.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; She agreed as she stepped inside. &quot;So what can I do for you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you see, a while back Trixie had an Exalted Loop,&quot; the performer explained.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, and you want some tips? No problem, I&#039;ve got <i>loads</i> of them. The thing I think a lot of ponies overlook is-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no,&quot; she interrupted. &quot;Trixie was wondering if you&#039;ve ever... Forgotten how to make it work?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m... Not quite sure what you mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, one Loop Trixie was experimenting with applying the non-lethal Charm to my fireworks, and the next I just... Didn&#039;t know <i>how</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm...&quot; The delivery mare tapped a hoof against her chin. &quot;What were you doing with the fireworks?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie just thought it would be nice to show off a few of her more spectacular pieces to an audience that can&#039;t ascend. Nothing <i>really</i> dangerous,&quot; she assured quickly. &quot;Just bright enough to strain the eyes more than would otherwise be wise, but I set them off at night and by morning the Charm made it so the damage never happened. It was nice,&quot; she added. &quot;Being able to cut loose a little on ponies who hadn&#039;t seen it all before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright,&quot; Derpy replied with a sombre nod. &quot;I think I know <i>exactly</i> what went wrong. Can you check your Pocket for anything <i>you</i> didn&#039;t put there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, sure,&quot; Trixie answered with a note of confusion. She spent a moment doing some metaphysical rummaging before drawing a small white card from her Pocket.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;This account&#039;s access to the Exalted Power Set has been restricted. We apologize for any inconvenience.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What.&quot; Trixie deadpanned after reading the note.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight said it was an automated system,&quot; Derpy explained. &quot;Exalted needs to be kept stable, which means Loopers have to pass through, and some of them are going to get Exaltations. Those stick around because they touch on the soul, but Loopers hitting Limit Breaks would be... Bad.&quot; She placed a consoling hoof on the unicorn&#039;s shoulder. &quot;You were gaining Limit, Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Trixie... I... When?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You put the show before the audience, and that&#039;s not really <i>you</i>. You might have known it wouldn&#039;t really hurt them in the long term, but it still counts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... I suppose I did,&quot; she answered after a moment. &quot;Is there any way to get it back? I could be more careful.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe. Would you want to use it for anything else?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie cocked her head as she considered. She&#039;d long since hit explosive yields that could crash Loops, so the sheer power wasn&#039;t a selling point. There were a few other tricks that could be useful, but...</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I suppose not,&quot; she admitted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then no sense worrying over it,&quot; Derpy told her with a wide smile. &quot;And if you ever <i>do</i> need a Charm or two, you can always come to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just might take you up on that,&quot; Trixie answered with a grin of her own. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">107.3 continued (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">One of the perks of alicornhood — in this Loop, at least — was that food and sleep were not strictly necessary. As such, Celestia had been more than able to spend the better part of a week curled up in a fetal position on her bed, staring at nothing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess?&quot;</p><p class="double">An ear flicked. Aside from that, Celestia didn&#039;t move. Her eyes had begun itching around day two, but she&#039;d gotten used to it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess, it&#039;s Twilight Sparkle.&quot;</p><p class="double">Of course, she had been eating beforehoof (hand?), but a few careful teleportations took care of the inevitable. The sun acted as an excellent incinerator.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please, Princess Celestia. Luna&#039;s worried sick. I&#039;m—er...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia found herself imagining Twilight&#039;s blush. Poor, innocent filly. Girl? Had she once had hands? Was &quot;Twilight Sparkle&quot; really her name?</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia, I&#039;m coming in, whether you open this door or not.&quot;</p><p class="double">Had she always had that determination? Had she tried to stop Discord and failed? No, it was unlike the draconequus to let anypo... anyone forget his victories.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tia, get up. You&#039;re making a disgrace of yourself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia found her body obeying automatically. Twilight had quite the maternal tone of command when she wanted one. Surprising, to say the least. Had that always been the—</p><p class="double">&quot;Tia, whatever you&#039;re thinking, stop. Look at me.&quot;</p><p class="double">She did so, looking at the muzzle she remembered, yet couldn&#039;t help trying to picture as something else. Then she noticed another muzzle. &quot;Twi — &quot; Celestia grimaced. She could choose not to thirst, but her throat still dried out. After a conjured glass of water, she tried again. Her voice was still rough, but recognizable. &quot;Twilight, who is this?&quot;</p><p class="double">The other unicorn knelt. &quot;Your Highness. Twilight told me about what Discord did. I will be more than pleased to aid you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aid me? Aid me how?&quot;</p><p class="double">A cloud of smoke erupted from the mare. A taller, thinner form rose from it, nearly eye level with Celestia. &quot;My name is Lyra Heartstrings. I&#039;m an anthropologist.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Cutie Mark Magic was subtle, powerful, and rarely encountered outside Equestria.</p><p class="double">Twilight knew this.</p><p class="double">The infinite loops seemed to love just screwing her over with variants and odd fusions.</p><p class="double">Twilight knew this as well.</p><p class="double">So, in retrospect, a loop where the cutie mark could actually be physically manifested should not have come as a surprise. But as Rainbow Dash zipped by using her multicolored lightning like a rocket, she could only stare in bemusement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Twi.&quot; Pinkie floated over, suspended by her balloons. &quot;You try this gimmick yet?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;According to my loop memories I actually have a court order not to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Makes sense, I guess. Oh, one of Fluttershy&#039;s butterflies sent me a message, apparently Applejack is hosting a picnic – her cutie mark regenerates. I asked Rarity if she would come but she decided to try digging for gems with her diamonds...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.13 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Berry, Brain Bleach. Now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bartender looked up at two almost-identical grey pegasi. &quot;Oh hello. Mac hasn&#039;t even set up the bar yet, what&#039;s–?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Ditzy,&quot; said the one with the purple mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Derpy,&quot; explained the one with the yellow mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re married,&quot; Ditzy clarified.</p><p class="double">&quot;And we both just Woke Up,&quot; Derpy finished.</p><p class="double">Berry blinked. &quot;....alright, brain bleach it is.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.14 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight awoke, felt an all too familiar absence of body, and gave a psychic groan. &quot;Oh, not <i>this</i> again...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, why am I a gestalt intelligence of a hive mind of alicorns?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome to the Wastes, Trixie. First of all, I apologize in advance for the loop memories–&quot;</p><p class="double">In a moment of perfect timing, the two minds were assaulted with recollections of their predicament. Trixie recoiled for a moment, her whole being flinching briefly. &quot;What the birch?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. Um–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, nevermind. Preawake, wasn&#039;t you. It&#039;s just...&quot; Trixie floundered. &quot;We&#039;re two hundred years late! I thought this wasn&#039;t supposed to be possible, I mean, early beginnings yeah but–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This isn&#039;t our home loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie paused. Then she selected a couple of bodies, offering one to Twilight. &quot;Right, if we&#039;re having this discussion let&#039;s do it outside the mindspace?&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple alicorn shrugged, stretching the limbs as she settled into the form. &quot;Oh, that feels good. Sorry, where was I... oh! You remember the Crash, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">The blue alicorn sighed. &quot;Yes, I remember the Crash....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know how it started because one universe tried to jumpstart another?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, a while back Sleipnir approached me with a request that Equestria do that for another loop,&quot; Twilight explained. &quot;See, apparently the loop started off pretty bad, in terms of environment, and there was enough damage that it would need a linked anchor system anyway, but the admins figured with our talent for, you know, healing loopers, we could intro the new anchors and keep them sane. After I studied up on the loop I talked it over with the ponies Awake at the time and eventually me and Fluttershy agreed to help out. Things went well and all, it&#039;s just...&quot; She gestured around vaguely. &quot;For some reason the fused loop ended up being THIS history and now it&#039;s a legitimate variation or something.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Trixie pondered the implications. &quot;Okay... so, what do we do now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, one of the first things I usually do is stage an internal coup and then station alicorns around the wasteland...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.15 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle suddenly exploded.</p><p class="double">After a few seconds, her friends looked around at each other in confusion. Applejack hesitantly raised a hoof. &quot;Ain&#039;t tha loop supposed ta crash if she dies?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded slowly. &quot;There are two explanations I can think of. She&#039;s not dead, for a given value of dead, or we have another Anchor somewhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh.&quot; Rainbow Dash prodded the ash. &quot;Hold on a sec.&quot; She closed her eyes.</p><p class="double">Then Rainbow Dash exploded.</p><p class="double">Pinkie blinked, stared at her necklace, and slowly put it down. She trotted to the other side of the room. &quot;Alrighty, laughter power, basic test.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie exploded.</p><p class="double">Rarity and Fluttershy shared a look. Eventually, Fluttershy coughed. &quot;Um, Applejack, could this be some sort of illusion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooooh no.&quot; Applejack threw her necklace out the window. &quot;Ah&#039;m not gonna blow up using mah Honesty powers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity sighed. &quot;Back to square one, I–&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity exploded without warning.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy stomped a hoof with a frown. &quot;That&#039;s not fair, she wasn&#039;t using her element!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack groaned. &quot;Great, so we&#039;re doomed any–&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy exploded quickly.</p><p class="double">Applejack stared.</p><p class="double">Applejack finally exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...well,&quot; Twilight managed. &quot;That was... bizarre. Anybody have any idea what&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a general chorus of negative answers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooookay then.&quot; The unicorn looked around the white room they were in, noting the panel construction. &quot;If I had to hazard a guess, Aperture is doing weird experiments and we got caught up in it. Play it straight or alicorn bulldozers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Play it straight,&quot; Pinkie suggested. &quot;More fun that way.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.16 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Normally, when Loopers from other worlds visited Equestria, they were left within their comfort zone, whatever that happened to be. On one extreme, Rincewind never set foot out of the library except to buy potatoes (1). On the other hoof, there were visitors like Bruce Wayne, who sought out the dangers of Equestria to the point that Fluttershy had to open a special asylum for the frightened monsters of the Everfree Forest.(2)</p><p class="double">But very, very seldom did a visiting Looper get dragged along on an otherwise baseline adventure. Lucky Number (such was his pony name, this Loop) was a special case.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ladies, if you please,&quot; he said as the six Element bearers guided him up the side of Smoky Mountain, &quot;I would like to point out that my vast experience with dragons, as you put it, is in fact vast experience with ONE dragon. Furthermore, I never do any serious harm to him. It&#039;s Bard the Bowman or, on occasion, Gandalf who do for him. I am quite frankly out of my depth where it comes to dragons from other worlds.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re not asking you to slay him,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;We just need him to move someplace else for his century-long nap, so Equestria won&#039;t be covered with smoke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;d normally handle it ourselves,&quot; Rainbow Dash added, &quot;seeing how we&#039;re just that awesome. But we wanted to see how a classic adventurer like yourself would handle it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You get picked once by a wizard with a whim, and everyone believes it&#039;s your career,&quot; Lucky Number grumbled. &quot;Oh, very well then. But without a magic ring or elvish blade, I can&#039;t promise it&#039;ll be very entertaining.&quot;</p><p class="double">At the entrance to the cave, the visiting Looper added, &quot;No hidden side door? I thought not. Why make it easy on a poor old hobbit?&quot; Despite his grumbling he walked forward into the cave, stepping right up to the dragon&#039;s hoard. He picked up a handful of jewels and let them fall back to the ground with a clatter.</p><p class="double">The dragon woke with a start, eyes open and almost instantly locked on the curly-maned Shire pony in the waistcoat.</p><p class="double">&quot;I trust I have your attention, good sir dragon?&quot; Without more than a beat of silence he continued on, &quot;My name is Lucky Number. By trade I am the premiere green-grocer for Ponyville, second only to Filthy Rich in my dealings with ponies near and far. By profession, however, I happen to be a burglar, or professional treasure hunter if you prefer that sort of thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon&#039;s growl, and the lowering of its head to the pony&#039;s diminutive height, indicated that it did not prefer.</p><p class="double">&quot;You needn&#039;t be terribly concerned, dear chap,&quot; the pony continued. &quot;I wouldn&#039;t give tuppence for most of this. I have been requested by the noteworthies of Ponyville, and of Equestria in general, to remove only one thing from this cave. Once I have removed the one thing I shall depart, leaving the rest behind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think,&quot; the dragon&#039;s deep voice echoed, shaking the cave, &quot;that you&#039;re going to take ANYTHING from this cave and leave it alive?&quot; It lowered its head still further, until the tip of its beak was level with the pony&#039;s muzzle. &quot;What IS this &#039;one thing&#039; you intend to take, then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, this,&quot; the pony said, reaching a hoof up to touch the dragon&#039;s jaw.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A few moments later Lucky Number walked out of the cave. The smoke had ceased. &quot;I trust my services are no longer required?&quot; he asked the six ponies.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a... novel... way of solving the problem, but...&quot; Twilight shuffled her feet.</p><p class="double">&quot;We was expectin&#039; somethin&#039; more... creative,&quot; Rarity added.</p><p class="double">&quot;More acrobatic!&quot; Pinkie Pie grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;More hilarious.&quot; Rainbow Dash nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Less disturbin&#039;,&quot; Applejack grumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;You let him out of there right this minute, mister.&quot; Fluttershy&#039;s voice of disapproval was almost as good as the Stare.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; Lucky Number shrugged. &quot;I suppose he&#039;s learned his lesson by now, at any rate.&quot; He reached into subspace and pulled out the dragon, which lay curled up and trembling on the cliff before the cave.</p><p class="double">&quot;How... how did you do that?&quot; it asked, its rumble shrunken to a quavering whisper that still echoed off the mountains.</p><p class="double">&quot;Secret of the trade, my good fellow,&quot; the pony said, straightening its waistcoat with dignity. &quot;Now, since I have removed the one thing from the cave, I do hope it shall not be necessary for me to remove it again. I recommend you pack your bags immediately, down to the last jewel-encrusted handkerchief, and find new lodgings quite a long way off. Because I shall be back this way in a few days to check...&quot; The little pony put a hoof on the dragon&#039;s jaw and guided it so that dragon eyes looked into pony eyes. &quot;And next time you shan&#039;t hear me coming. I trust I am making myself clear?&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon nodded meekly.</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s a good chap. Off you go, then,&quot; the pony said, removing his hoof.</p><p class="double">The dragon, frantic to get away from the pony, scrambled into the cave. A few moments later the sound of frantic shoveling echoed from inside.(3)</p><p class="double">&quot;And that, ladies, should take care of that,&quot; the pony said.</p><p class="double">&quot;You seemed rather calm through all that.&quot; Twilight cast an eye at the visiting Looper. &quot;Especially after all that talk about your limited experience with dragons.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes,&quot; the pony admitted, &quot;and when I tried that trick with Smaug(4) it didn&#039;t end so well. But I have found it very effective with most goblins of my acquaintance. And bill-collectors, too, come to think of it.&quot; Bilbo Baggins set off back down the mountain, calling back, &quot;I believe we may be back home in time for tea!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And I missed him?&quot; Sweetie Belle moaned. &quot;Of all the Loops to not be Awake for!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, he did leave you a gift,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Gandalf told him about your special Loop, and Bilbo was quite impressed.&quot;</p><p class="double">The purple princess slid two red cases containing manuscript books across the table to sweetie. On one the spines read, in Westron: <i>There and Back Again; Translations From the Elvish, Vol. 1-3;</i> and <i>Appendices, Maps, Familes and Other Notes.</i> Manuscript copies of the Red Book of Westmarch were fairly rare even among Loopers.</p><p class="double">The other red case had four books, with no marking on the spine. Sweetie Belle withdrew one and opened it to the title page:</p><p class="double"><i>Songs of the Ponies, as Rendered in the Elvish Modes by B. Baggins, Volume 1.</i></p><p class="double">Below this, in a less careful, more personal hand:</p><p class="double"><i>A copy, as a Present to a great singer who did NOT badger a guest into confronting a dragon, unlike CERTAIN OTHERS. - B. B.(5)</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot; Sweetie Belle asked, &quot;is there something I should know about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Twilight said, rubbing her mane nervously, &quot;there&#039;s a reason he gave me a copy of <i>Archery And You</i> instead...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(1) Except for one memorable encounter with an unAwake Discord, recounted elsewhere.</p><p class="double">(2) By the time Fluttershy, fed up with the whole situation, went to Wayne to tell him to cut it out, he had vanished. He was last seen that Loop riding the Tatzlwurm out into the depths of the Badlands.</p><p class="double">(3) The dragon spent quite some time afterwards tracking down Equestria&#039;s master thieves, trying in vain to learn the trick. His anxiety was by no means eased when his hoard mysteriously increased by one-seventh part not long after he found his new residence. Eventually some other dragons put him to bed with a dragon-sized glass of warm milk and told him to chalk it up as yet another reason Why We Do Not Mess With The Ponies.</p><p class="double">(4) It was an accident. Bilbo wanted to avoid using the Ring whenever possible, so he decided to build up his subspace pocket by stealing more of Smaug&#039;s hoard every Loop. Then one Loop he stole the entire hoard at one swipe... and the sleeping Smaug along with it. Fortunately Gandalf had accompanied the Dwarves to Erebor that Loop, and was on hand to resolve the situation the next time Bilbo had to open said subspace pocket. When Smaug later began Looping, Bilbo decided not to relate this story to him... in particular, what the dwarves had done to his jewel-encrusted chest.(6)</p><p class="double">(5) Bilbo wasn&#039;t particularly annoyed at Twilight and her friends, but he did enjoy using presents to make a point. His Farewell Party, whenever he could have it, was usually his favorite part of his baseline Loop for that very reason.</p><p class="double">(6) That loop the gates of the Lonely Mountain gained a very impressive, glittery, and somewhat morbid colonnade. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.17 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">Gandalf the Grey took a moment to collect his thoughts as the new loop formed. <i>Early September, 1401 Shire Reckoning. Ah. Bilbo&#039;s Farewell Party... though I usually have just the one-pony cart on this trip.</i></p><p class="double">Then again, the usual pony wasn&#039;t bright pink. Nor was it azure. But the two hitched side-by-side before him were just those shades.</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie is not sure if she likes how this loop is starting,&quot; said the blue one.</p><p class="double">&quot;But we&#039;re on our way to a party!&quot; enthused the pink one. &quot;A double birthday party! Woohoo!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Now fairly certain as to the identity of his companions, the wizard looked back at the larger-than-usual load of fireworks in the wagon bed. A noise from ahead caused him to turn back to see the pink one cheerfully working on what appeared to be a 16-tube Multiple-Launch Party system.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh dear.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I wonder if it&#039;s too late to make a run for the Grey Havens...</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.18 (novusordomundi / Fanofmosteverything )</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why do your eyes look like...&quot;</p><p class="double">A sigh cut off the rest of the sentence. &quot;I don&#039;t know why my eyes are in the exact shape of the Caspian Sea, Rarity. And the only reason I know that is because of my Loop memories.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity paused a bit, searching her own memories. &quot;Ah... Mine seem to be Lake Erie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. I&#039;m already writing a list of the different shapes I see this Loop.&quot; Twilight pulled a checklist out of her saddlebag, letting it unfurl. &quot;I&#039;ve already found 36 different types of eye shapes, in variable amounts. All bodies of water, which at least keeps it constant. But since it doesn&#039;t seem to affect vision, I&#039;m not too worried. Only thing odd is Derpy&#039;s eyes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh? What do they look like?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight let a small grin form on her face. &quot;Same as they always do.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight took in the landscape. &quot;Okay, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it was actually pretty easy,&quot; said Derpy. &quot;I just had to put up a big enough entropy bubble and walk forward a little.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was actually more interested in the &#039;why&#039; than the &#039;how&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that.&quot; The pegasus shrugged as the new, perfectly oval Everfree Lake filled in from the river. &quot;I didn&#039;t want to be left out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. &quot;Well, at least Steven Magnet seems to be enjoying himself.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.19 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">Twilight failed to realize something was different about the loop until Cadence&#039;s Wedding was upon them...or more specifically there was no wedding. At first, she thought Shining had forgotten again, but when she hit Mac&#039;s Bar in frustration, she found Cadence sitting at the counter, tears in her eyes.</p><p class="double">The element of Magic stroked the Princess of Love&#039;s mane as she cried out, &quot;Shiny is married to his work!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. This was new, &quot;Oh...Cadence, I&#039;m sorry. You want to prank him for standing you up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence sniffed, &quot;No, he really got married to his job. I even have wedding photos as the best mare before waking up.&quot;</p><p class="double">A set of photos appeared on the counter, showing Shiny in a tuxedo and his armor decked out in a wedding dress. Apparently he even had cake, and still never told Twilight. </p><p class="double">A week later, Shining found himself frozen feet first to the top of Celestia&#039;s throne room. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.20 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;...Certain warriors came to Pandora in droves, to uncover its hidden secrets. Some would call them adventurers. Others call them insane. But I... call them Loopers.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Our story begins with them, and with a man named Handsome Jack.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The four Vault Hunters were having a little meet and greet on the train, as they rode to whatever meeting place this Jack guy was bringing them. Everything was going well, until those boxes in the back turned out to be robots, and that whole &quot;Welcome, to your doom&quot; sign.</p><p class="double">As the blue pony went out the door, and the black one went out the roof, the yellow and purple ones started running down the train car. Sliding under the robot&#039;s gunfire, the yellow one threw a box at the ceiling, where it clamped in place and deployed into an auto-turret. Spying a rocket launcher, she grabbed it and turned around to fire at another group of robots. Everything seemed to freeze, for just an instant.</p><p class="double"><b>Applebloom,</b></p><p><i>as the Engineer.</i></p><p class="double">As she Woke up, pulling the trigger, Applebloom blinked. &quot;Did I just get a character splash screen?&quot;</p><p class="double">After she finished shielding herself from the explosion, the purple one smirked as she lifted the surviving robots in her magic.</p><p class="double"><b>Twilight Sparkle,</b></p><p><i>as the Mage.</i></p><p class="double">Waking up herself, Twilight threw them through the wall, and turned around to tell Applebloom. &quot;Yes, you did. I just had one too, did you see it?&quot;</p><p class="double">As they spoke, the blue one swung back into the car. Pulling out a pair of Torgue-built weapons, she set about exploding any robots still moving.</p><p class="double"><b>Trixie,</b></p><p><i>as The Great and Powerful.</i></p><p class="double">Trixie considered what she was doing as she Woke, and proceeded to continue what she was doing.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, atop the train, three humans were looking for the last Vault Hunter. That is, until the one in the middle shoved the other two off the train. She Awoke in a flash of green fire.</p><p class="double"><b>And Chrysalis,</b></p><p><i>as The Face.</i></p><p class="double">After considering the oddity she Woke up to, Chrysalis decided to think about it <i>after</i> she got back inside the train. And sorted out that whole &quot;someone&#039;s trying to kill us&quot; thing.</p><p class="double">As the three ponies, and one changeling, assembled before the door to the caboose, they couldn&#039;t help but notice the music that had been filtering in from somewhere, during the whole fight. <i>&quot;This ain&#039;t no place for no hero. This ain&#039;t no place for no better man...&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;You know, the music and the splash screens make this whole thing feel really surreal.&quot; Applebloom commented, as she bucked open the door.</p><p class="double">The music cut out, as the door flew from its hinges, and they saw the room they were about to enter. As the mannequin in the chair turned around, a new voice came over the speakers. &quot;It&#039;s cute that ya&#039;ll think you&#039;re the heroes of this little adventure, but you&#039;re not.&quot; Also, the car was filled with bombs. &quot;Welcome to Pandora, kiddos!&quot;</p><p class="double">Everything went pink, as the train exploded. Reappearing on the ice, they all watched the train cars go flying from the explosion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, girls?&quot; Twilight began, as the train settled into the snow. &quot;Let&#039;s find some cover, and figure out where we are. And maybe where we are on the planet, and in relation to the plot.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lyra woke up, feeling like she had a slight case of Headacheneverendus. While she was very cold, she didn&#039;t appear to be in any real danger right at the moment. Naturally, her first action was to start talking to herself.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Alright crew, sound off! Extremity validation check! Four legs detected.&#039;</i> Thief started them off.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Independently swivelable ears, check!&#039;</i> Human Lyra giggled in their brain.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Yes yes, great fun, humans have static ears. Horn, check.&#039;</i> Pony Lyra continued.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Hey, guys? That little robot that was expositing just noticed we&#039;re not dead.</i> Seapony Lyra, for once, was the one paying attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;...But my friends call me Claptrap! Or they would, if any of them were still alive. Or had existed in the first place! Oh - I&#039;ve got something for you!&quot; Now that they were paying attention, they all saw the boxy robot that had started talking to them.</p><p class="double">As they took the communicator Claptrap claimed he didn&#039;t loot from a corpse, in spite of looting it from a corpse right in front of her, Lyra decided the polite thing to do was thank him. Or call him on the obvious lie.</p><p class="double">&quot;My bong is full of minestrone tea!&quot; Or that.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;What was that?&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;AHH! By Yggsdrasil&#039;s left acorn, what is that thing?!&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Okay, ladies, don&#039;t panic. I think we just found out where our Loop memories are, and they have a personality of their own.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;There are rutabagas are in my pants!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;And it&#039;s the only one of us with access to the voicebox.&#039;</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.21 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Context is a great and terrible thing.</p><p class="double">For instance, Twilight Sparkle leading a charge of humanoid radishes against the villainous trash cat armies of tyrant Rainbow Dash in a Saddle Arabian sandstorm whilst wielding a bifurcated katana... was something that developed logically from previous events. In fact, a number of loopers present, when recounting the tale, would be surprised at the odd looks they received and the disbelief it incurred.</p><p class="double">But, without context, it was perfectly rational to consider it irrational. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.22 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Rarity desperately wished for fingers, just so she could pinch her brow in an appropriate manner. Eventually, she settled for a simple facehoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve had to repair my own cape and hat loads of times,&quot; Trixie pointed out. &quot;You really shouldn&#039;t be surprised that I could make a dress.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...An. Exploding dress.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes.&quot; The blue unicorn preened as a few percussive blasts ran down her back. &quot;It was simple enough to weave oxygen collectors in the collar and with release runes stitched at various places–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. I don&#039;t want to know.&quot; Rarity sighed. &quot;Today will go down in infamy as one of the greatest tragedies fashion has ever endured...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">108.23 (Valentine Meikin, Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up as a pair of unicorn stallions with mostly black coats walked up to her. &quot;My name is Whitman, and my partner here is Blackman,&quot; one of them said in a gravelly voice. &quot;I believe that you seem to have a strange belief that ponies are able to meet humans and vice versa...&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked them over, noting that both of them were wearing sunglasses, and sighed. &quot;So, who are you really? The Stallions In Black?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We did consider being the Stallions In Neutral, but the initials were counter-productive,&quot; &#039;Whitman&#039; stated, &quot;Now, if you&#039;ll excuse me...&quot;</p><p class="double">His horn then suddenly flashed with some kind of spell.</p><p class="double">&quot;You didn&#039;t see a pair of stallions asking about humans, you saw nothing, and there is no agency named the Stallions In Black,&quot; &#039;Whitman&#039; stated, then walked off, leaving Twilight blinking and looking confused. She was sure she noticed something strange around here...</p><p class="double">After a few moments, she concentrated and cast a spell.</p><p class="double">Then she groaned. &quot;Oh for the love of – You two, get back here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Whitman&#039; and &#039;Blackman&#039; froze.</p><p class="double">&quot;One: Equestria is a sanctuary loop, intended for rest, relaxation, and recuperation. Two: I&#039;m the anchor, I&#039;m here to help, if you need anything you can ask me. Three: My special talent is magic, I am fully capable of banishing you to the moon, but if you don&#039;t do anything that harms anyone there won&#039;t be a problem.&quot; She snorted. &quot;I&#039;m letting your little neuralizer trick slide, since I know that&#039;s how you normally operate, but the fact is that if my memory has been altered I might assume I am under attack by a dangerous foe and react accordingly.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a breath and let it out slowly. &quot;But I don&#039;t want to be a threat. Just... if things go down, let me know. That&#039;s it. Alright? This is your vacation, you&#039;re not on duty.&quot; </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Better than tryin&#039; t&#039;make sense of whut is cornsidered fashion aroun&#039; hyar.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.2 (Bardic Knowledge)</p><p class="double">Twilight and her Awake friends rushed to Canterlot at Celestia&#039;s summons. It was around the time of Discord&#039;s usual escape, but there hadn&#039;t been any chaos, so she was a bit confused (thinking, for a brief moment, that this was one of those variants where Celestia and Luna outright killed him). Other than Ganondorf&#039;s little vacation, a little chaos was typical for a Discord-replacement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, thank goodness you&#039;re here. Hopefully we&#039;re not too late. The Destroyer of the Skies has awakened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Destroyer of the Skies?&quot; Dash looked worried at the prospect.</p><p class="double">&quot;A fearsome monster of stone and crystal from an unknown land. It bears an unnatural hatred for all winged things. Over a thousand years ago, Luna and I neutralized it with the Elements of Harmony, freezing it in place and barely saving the life of a pegasus it had been attacking.&quot; There was the usual speech about getting the Elements and going after the Destroyer, as Twilight tried to puzzle out who it was replacing Discord this time around...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile...</p><p class="double">Mac&#039;s Bar had seen its share of odd patrons (it was inevitable with customers like Discord and the draconequified Silver Spoon), but when the doors slammed open and a eight-foot-tall humanoid of rock stomped in, Big Mac was temporarily taken aback.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>You. Barkeep,</b>&quot; it rumbled. &quot;<b>I hear this bar has a drink for everyone. I need one </b><u><b>now</b><b>.</b></u>&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac quickly sidled aside for Berry to work her magic. Which was surprisingly literal for this drink, requiring an ascension to mix magic into the liquid. As the creature of stone emptied the ethereal drink from its glass, the rainbow of crystals across its arms and back glowed brighter. As a thousand years more of birds and their... leavings... was difficult to excise from memory, another drink was ordered.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>Oh, it is </b><u><b>good</b></u><b>. I will have to recommend its bar to Justice. It is difficult for it to get drunk when it is a possessed corpse.</b>&quot; Another drink was put on the bar. &quot;<b>I am Shale, by the way. What does it call itself?</b>&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.3 (Sieses Detkrah)</p><p class="double">“Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.”</p><p class="double">“Huh?”</p><p class="double">“Sunset,” the purple pony clarified. “I think Twilight and I literally swapped roles this time around, sorry Rarity.”</p><p class="double">“I’m Sweetie,” the white unicorn clarified back.</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Sunset blinked. “Wonder who the others are, then?”</p><p class="double">“Only one way to find out!” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.4 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned at the guest Looper. &quot;You&#039;re absolutely sure about this?&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded. &quot;I&#039;m not on my own all that often, and I want to see how far I&#039;ve come.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can appreciate that, but Tirek isn&#039;t a toy. He rendered the entire population of Equestria powerless in the baseline, and between the late Awakening and the two of us being the only ones Awake, he&#039;s probably done it again.&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;I just don&#039;t think you&#039;ve thought this through.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All I ask is a chance to prove myself, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">She stomped a hoof and glared at him. &quot;Prove what? To whom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To myself. To my brother. To the world.&quot; He offered a weak smile, one that didn&#039;t reach his eyes. &quot;Besides, you&#039;ll be there to bail me out if all else fails, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If it weren&#039;t for all the powerless ponies in Tirek&#039;s wake...&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;Yeah, I probably would. Good luck.&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a chuckle. &quot;It&#039;d be nice.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tirek sneered at Discord. &quot;You&#039;ve helped me grow strong, you&#039;ve provided the means by which I can obtain Princess Twilight&#039;s magic, and now you are no longer of any use to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">A plaid cascade flowed from draconequus to centaur, and the latter grew to his full, terrible majesty.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem.&quot;</p><p class="double">All eyes turned to a green earth stallion, approaching from the direction of Ponyville. He was glaring at Tirek at an intensity of at least 0.6 Stares.</p><p class="double">Tirek was not impressed. &quot;Insignificant wretch. Not a spark of magic will escape me!&quot; His mouth yawned wide.</p><p class="double">Yet not a spark of magic was consumed. &quot;What?&quot; Tirek cast his gaze about.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me tell you a story.&quot;</p><p class="double">The centaur flinched. The voice was right next to his ear. &quot;Get off of me!&quot; He swatted at the pony.</p><p class="double">The pony who leapt like an exuberant Pinkie Pie, thus causing Tirek to whack himself in the head. The stallion landed next to Tirek&#039;s other ear, where he continued. &quot;My brother, he began with fire, and he stuck with it. He is like fire. Bright. Eager.&quot; A chuckle. &quot;Hungry. A great friend, and a great foe. But it was not for me. It never felt right. My flames were green, unnatural things. Strange, alien wisps that felt no pull from gravity. That did not belong.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek had, by this point, tried to get rid of the pesky pony at least five times. Going by touch, the stallion hadn&#039;t moved, and yet every swipe missed.</p><p class="double">&quot;So I branched out. Electricity satisfied me for a time. It is something of a brother to fire, after all. But I could tell my full potential did not lie there.&quot;</p><p class="double">All this babble of fire and lightning brought Tirek&#039;s magic to mind. But no, he was still digesting Discord&#039;s roiling chaos energy. There was no telling what an errant blast might do to him.</p><p class="double">&quot;It was some time before I admitted the truth to myself. My brother and I are different in so many ways. Wide and thin, short and tall, certain and doubtful… it is only natural that we be light and dark.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Prattle on much longer,&quot; Tirek grumbled, &quot;and the two of you will be alive and dead. Only one pony can possibly stand in my way now, and you are not her. What do you hope to accomplish?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Against you?&quot; And now the hoofed flea&#039;s tone shifted from conversational to condemning. &quot;You who forsook your own brother, who come from the darkness beneath the earth? I oppose you with the darkness within me. A darkness that prophecies claimed would be the end of all existence. They were wrong. <i>You</i> are wrong.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bold talk.&quot; Tirek grinned despite himself. At least the snack had some mettle. &quot;Who are you, to boast so?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who am I?&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion pushed off, and Tirek nearly staggered from the force. He looked up and wondered where the nuisance was hiding his wings. The question only grew in Tirek&#039;s mind as black lightning lashed at him. Not strong enough to hurt, but strangely cold. Worse, it smelled totally inedible.</p><p class="double">The pony landed right between Tirek&#039;s horns, and the impact made the centaur sink a few inches into the ground. It hurt like nothing had any right to hurt. Not with so much power at hand. Not after so much time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who am I? I am Luigi. Number one.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.5 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">Something everyone realizes, eventually, is that if you Loop long enough, certain patterns begin to emerge. In baseline or variants, some things just go together; the Ruler, the Student, and the Thousandth Year, for example.</p><p class="double">But then there are other patterns. What might have been rumors and misconceptions in baseline, could easily find themselves to be real, for a given loop. Scootaloo&#039;s variable parenthood, some of what revolves around Nyx, the occasional strange loop involving the changelings.</p><p class="double">For Celestia, the pattern of this kind she encounters most often, involves her relationship with Twilight. In baseline, there were more than a few misinformed visitors who mistook Twilight as her daughter, to say nothing of all the rumors and tabloids. As one might imagine, Twilight&#039;s ascension brought all that back to the surface, for a while.</p><p class="double">And so it goes, Celestia sometimes found herself Twilight&#039;s mother, for a given loop; most often in secret, but occasionally publicly, and sometimes something in between. It wasn&#039;t limited to just Twilight either, a memorable example being the loop where she was Scootaloo&#039;s parent.</p><p class="double">But parent or teacher, at the end of the day Celestia had thousands of years of experience in raising Twilight. Ditzy had pointed out to her, some time ago, that it gave her some common ground with herself and Berry. Those conversations had been a nice bonding experience between the three of them.</p><p class="double">Still, no matter how well she knew Twilight, both as a filly and a mare, <i>alicorn</i> filly Twilight always managed to surprise her, somehow. These were Celestia&#039;s thoughts, as she stared at the wreckage of her study. In four hours, Twilight had her CSGU entrance exam, same time as she always did. Three minutes ago, Rainbow Dash shattered the sky with her Rainboom; something she resolved to look into, later.</p><p class="double">Turning from the hole in the wall, Celestia looked at her daughter, and the little grey earth pony hiding behind her. Twilight knew she was in trouble, and the earth pony she was playing with at the time thought she was as well.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot; Celestia began, removing her hoof from her face. &quot;I honestly didn&#039;t expect to give you the &#039;Sapient Creations Talk&#039; for another decade. You&#039;re not in trouble for that, though I&#039;ll need to check your friend, and make sure there&#039;s nothing wrong with her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Leaning to the side, to look more directly at the grey pony hiding behind Twilight, Celestia gave the mismatched eyes a gentle smile. &quot;I suppose I should say welcome to the family, Smarty Pants.&quot;</p><p class="double">With both fillies showing small smiles now, Celestia turned back to Twilight. &quot;Oh, one last thing, dear.&quot; Celestia pointed at her flank. &quot;Congratulations, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Twilight danced around in a circle in celebration of her cutie mark, half dragging Smarty Pants along with her, Celestia started taking a closer look at what was left of her study. As her walk reached the hole in the wall, she peered out to see what had befallen her favorite chair. It appeared to have been broken across Discord&#039;s head, with the cushion impaled on Discord&#039;s stony horns.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot; The fillies looked over to her. Now that she could see the former doll properly, Smarty Pants looked to be about three quarters Twilight&#039;s size. &quot;After your cuteceañera, you&#039;re grounded.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awwww, Mom!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.6 (Draconas)</p><p class="double">It was right before World War Two.</p><p class="double">Discord was on trial in a courtroom, with stitches joining his parts together. Given this was Discord, the judge&#039;s bench was on the upper corner, the witness booth was floating in the middle of the room, and the jury box was five seconds in the future.</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord Frankenstein, you stand accused of crimes against the Axis Powers, including but not limited to shaving Hitler&#039;s mustache off before beating him up with a giant swastika, making fart jokes about kamikazes, and turning Benito Mussolini into a giant face. How do you plead?&quot; The judge intoned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Already absolved!&quot; Discord cried, everyone gasping in surprise.</p><p class="double">&quot;As you can see, on the Anti-Comintern pact,&quot; here Discord pulled said pact out before putting it under a giant microscope &quot;the molecules <i>here</i> are in the shape of letters, and they are arranged into words. Could someone please read what it says?&quot;</p><p class="double">A member of the jury read it, after the five second delay for the rest of the world to catch up to them.&quot;Discord Frankenstein is hereby absolved of all crimes committed against any signatory of this document.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s how I prevented World War Two!&quot; Discord explained, drinking a water of glass. &quot;Since I had total immunity to punishment by the Axis Powers, they had to get rid of that document. Which meant they were no longer allies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But why were you Discord <i>Frankenstein</i>?&quot; Berry Punch asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I was Frankenstein&#039;s monster. That&#039;s how I ended up so far back.&quot; Discord explained. </p><p class="double">After a moment, Twilight decided to just take what she could get. At least he&#039;d <i>prevented</i> World War Two, rather than simply adding chocobo cavalry or something...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.7 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as she Awoke, then took in the scene before her. She was in one of the practice rooms of Celestia&#039;s School for Gifted Unicorns, but no younger than usual. Even stranger was what she was doing there. &quot;Why am I hitting old arcade cabinets with a golf club?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The better question, my faithful cheat,&quot; came a voice both serene and snarky, with just a hint of a Hisponic accent, &quot;is why have you stopped hitting old arcade cabinets with a golf club?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to the source of the voice. A vaguely familiar humanoid clad in black pants, red shoes and boxing gloves, and a golden crown looked back, Celestia&#039;s luxurious mane flowing out the back of his luchador mask. After a moment of confusion, she recalled from a blend of Loop memories and past experience that that was actually his face. She dipped her head. &quot;Sorry, Prince Strongbadis. I had trouble awakening this morning.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Prince of Awesome and Also Equestria He Guesses quirked an eyehole/brow. &quot;Oh? You seemed more than capable but a moment ago.&quot; His mouth curled into a small, sly smile that had no business being on his face. &quot;You&#039;ll never get that pizza at this rate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nice as pizza sounded, there were probably more pressing concerns. &quot;Um, Your Highness, not to be presumptuous, but isn&#039;t your sis— brother due to return from the moon soon?&quot;</p><p class="double">Strongbadis considered this for a moment before bursting into laughter that was just a bit louder than decorum permitted. &quot;Oh, Twizzler,&quot; and here Twilight&#039;s Loop memories told her this was meant as a term of endearment, &quot;Prince Soolnda may have been sulking on the moon for almost a millennium, but I assure you, he won&#039;t be coming down any time soon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight dipped her head again. &quot;As you say, Your Highness.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I do say. Now, back to your postgraduate crap-out-of-beating studies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Well, if nothing else, it would be nicely cathartic. Twilight Sparkle, personal student-minion of Prince Strongbadis and magna cum laude of Crazy-Go-Nuts University, saluted her sovereign with the battered nine-iron. &quot;We who are about to whack the everloving crap out of video games salute you!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.8 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double">Applebloom banged her head against the wall of her newly-remade Apple Family Underground Bunker and exclaimed, &quot;Aaargh!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; asked Scootaloo and Diamond Tiara (Sweetie Belle was not awake, and in the absence of being tormented by Diamond Tiara would probably do fine).</p><p class="double">&quot;You know how sometimes you think of something you ought to have said, only the loop&#039;s over, and it&#039;s not a conserved event so it&#039;s not going to come up again?&quot;</p><p class="double">They nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;And you know when you get that feeling and the thing your brain is telling you you should have said doesn&#039;t even fit?&quot;</p><p class="double">They nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember the game a few loops back with the most minor variant?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo squinted. &quot;I guess so? That was, like, fifty years ago for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara shook her head, &quot;I don&#039;t remember that - my last Equestria loop was fifteen thousand years ago. But I know what you&#039;re talking about. Like, everything&#039;s the same except my hair is a little darker?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Except that this variant had to drive you nuts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, <i>that</i> game. Like when Luna trashed a wing of the palace because the rule for when to put the apostrophe in &#039;its&#039; was inverted?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, like that. So, I just remembered the time that the only difference was that &#039;ancestor&#039; had an &#039;ih&#039; sound.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence fell.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I can see why that&#039;d do it. If it came up.&quot; said Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, this was one that <i>didn&#039;t</i> fit, right? It just caught me by surprise when I thought someone said Granny Smith was my sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">Heads cocked. Diamond Tiara squinted and said, &quot;What? But... how? That&#039;s a big stretch.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing odd about it - she was my &#039;ancistor&#039;, just like usual.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooooooh.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.9 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">TK-421 woke up and rubbed the back of his head. The sensor tech had called for some help, and then... he couldn&#039;t remember. He did remember the freighter. His armor had been removed. He could find no sign of the techs or his partner.</p><p class="double">He got up, made his way to the cockpit and looked out. Complete darkness. He fired up the nav computer and checked the logs.</p><p class="double"><i>Odd. The last thing it remembers is landing on the Death Star. Am I in a cargo hold in the Death Star? I guess I could have been missed. This is going to be embarrassing when I get back to the squad.</i></p><p class="double">He went to the exit ramp. The safety interlock said the ship was not landed; he didn&#039;t override. <i>Not landed? Where am I and how could I have gotten here? I have a bad feeling about this.</i></p><p class="double">There was a sudden change in light from the cockpit, and he heard voices on the other side of the ramp. <i>It&#039;s not landed, so this shouldn&#039;t be opening.</i> He pressed his ear to it and listened.</p><p class="double">&quot;... barely got it pocketed in time. I&#039;m going to have some words with him. Just because you&#039;re an anchor and good at <i>Protego</i> doesn&#039;t mean you can survive direct hits from an anti-materiel blaster cannon more than a few times in a row.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t know that language, and that tone doesn&#039;t sound like a prisoner&#039;s, so I&#039;m not on the Death Star. I definitely heard &#039;direct hits something anti-materiel blaster cannon&#039;. Maybe this is a rebel repair crew? This isn&#039;t supposed to happen!</i> The ramp began lowering, and only then did TK-421 notice that the interlock no longer indicated a non-landed fault. He tried to get up, but the jerky motion and constrained space left him flatfooted.</p><p class="double">The orange and purple alien at the bottom of the ramp regarded him with surprise, then consternation. &quot;Aww, sumac. I knew I was forgetting something.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;, asked a yellow and red alien as it came into view. &quot;Ooh.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle relaxed into her own bed for the first time in eight subjective years - not a long span, but long enough that it was a special pleasure. Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash had offered to take care of Nightmare Moon, Spike had his own plans, she wasn&#039;t a princess, and didn&#039;t even have homework, so her day was empty.</p><p class="double">A knock on the door broke it, of course.</p><p class="double">She got up and started down the stairs, calling out, &quot;Come in!&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo walked in, followed by a human. Twilight froze, thought, and momentarily placed the face. She shifted to thinking in Imperial Basic and evenly said, &quot;Hello, TK-421. Welcome to Equestria.&quot; To Scootaloo, she said, &quot;Careless anchor, you wanted to save the Falcon, dragged him along?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo nodded.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;What have you told him?&quot; She resumed descending.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo thought. &quot;We have magic. Resistance is pointless. There is no Empire... anything else?&quot;</p><p class="double">TK-421 added, &quot;Watch out for the aqua-colored one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle considered. &quot;Since you brought him here against his will by means that are... not really something we want to encourage, I am considering assigning you to take care of him. Teach him any language he asks for, or translate if he doesn&#039;t feel like learning. If he wants a banana split for breakfast every morning, you get it, and you help him with the stomachache afterwards as best you can. If he takes a hike in the Everfree, you guide him and keep him safe. Any harm he causes to anypony, you caused - but you can&#039;t unduly restrain him. Does this seem fair to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo bit her lip and nodded.</p><p class="double">She turned to the human. &quot;And you? I understand if you&#039;d rather it not be her, or if you would rather set out on your own.&quot;</p><p class="double">TK-421 was stunned. &quot;No... I... ah.&quot;</p><p class="double">After five seconds of no response, Scootaloo muttered, &quot;Making choices for himself? Way outside his training.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave him a few more seconds before declaring, &quot;All right, how about we do that. If you&#039;re unhappy with it, come ask me and I&#039;ll work something out.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.10 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t need it to be big. A grain of sand would be enough.&quot; Captain Zelnick tried his best to look sternly at the 3 meter tall crystal shimmering with electrical energy who went by the name of &#039;Diamond Tiara&#039;, who had elected to part with the other Chenjesu and join him in his fleet, since she was really a pony. &quot;I could really use having those blueprints from day 1.&quot;</p><p class="double">He looked aside to Silver Spoon, who had similarly abandoned the other Mrnmhrm; she whirred and spun before replying, &quot;A pocket is hard to develop in a science-based setting, compared to magic-based settings.&quot; Her voice sounded odd, a natural young feminine voice coming from a telescoping robot with no other features analogous to any living thing he could think of.</p><p class="double">Zelnick retorted, &quot;This world has telepathic reading, mind control, and clairvoyance. I&#039;ve heard of mountains made of thoughts. What more do we need?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Telekinesis would help. Being a species with affinity to any of those things would help more.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a spark, Diamond Tiara activated her voice synthesizer. &quot;OF COURSE WE CAN TRY. IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME, THOUGH - MULTIPLE LOOPS. PERHAPS THE MOST USEFUL THING WOULD BE TO FIND THE LOCAL FIGURES WHO ALREADY KNOW ENOUGH TO HELP YOU PRACTICE.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup. Then we&#039;ll drill the parts they <i>don&#039;t</i> know into you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick swallowed. &quot;This is going to involve learning from the Pkunk, isn&#039;t it? Joy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, and if you can convince them, the Arilou. But I think you should start with the Syreen.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick considered. &quot;Well, if there was anything I could do that would convince the crew it&#039;s okay to take a year and a half or so off from this war, it&#039;s shore leave with the Syreen.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara again crackled with electricity, to say, &quot;DO NOT &#039;FORGET&#039; TO MOVE ON TO THE PKUNK AND ARILOU.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, all right!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.11 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Wandering around the usual Welcome-to-Ponyville surprise party, Twilight notice Derpy Hooves slumped against a bookshelf in the background, holding a plate with an untouched muffin on it. Asking the pardon of her unAwake friends, the purple unicorn walked over to the cross-eyed pegasus and asked, &quot;What&#039;s the matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I lost my Exaltation,&quot; Derpy sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where, under a couch?&quot; Twilight grinned. &quot;Did you leave it in the dirty clothes? Or maybe you put it in the icebox. I do that sometimes with books.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy&#039;s cock-eyed expression grew as serious as it was ever possible for Derpy to manage. &quot;No, really, Twilight. No more being Solar. It&#039;s gone.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. &quot;I thought it was impossible for you to lose that. I checked you myself. No Limit, remember? &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I never worried. But the last Loop I had, you weren&#039;t Awake- we must have had a stealth Anchor. And I happened to think: Everything is so easy now. Am I going to get bored with this? And then I started worrying about getting bored.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Well...&quot; Twilight pulled a PADD out of subspace and flipped through its memory to the role-playing game based on the Exalted universe. &quot;Shouldn&#039;t you have had, I dunno, a saving throw or something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t remember clearly,&quot; Derpy said. &quot;If I did, I think I failed it really, really bad. It was like all the derps I avoided struck at once, starting with my mind.&quot; She rubbed her temple with one hoof and added uncertainly, &quot;I think I remember saying at one point, &#039;<i>The Muffins Shall Last Forever.</i>&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooooooooh <i>shoot</i>,&quot; Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I woke up this morning here in Ponyville with a note and a photo clipped to my mail bag.&quot; Derpy pulled both out. The photo was taken from orbit; if Equestria had been a country on a planet-sized muffin, now Twilight knew what the muffin would look like. The note attached said, <i>That&#039;s quite enough of that, sorry. - Sleipnir</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Well... look at the bright side,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Now you don&#039;t have to worry about worrying anymore, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot; Derpy looked confused. &quot;No, no, no! I&#039;m not upset about not being Exalted anymore!&quot; She pointed to the muffin world. &quot;Apparently I did that... and I don&#039;t remember even taking a single bite! A muffin as big as the world... gone to waste...&quot; The blonde pegasus sighed disconsolately, looked at the normal sized muffin on her plate, and began to nibble on it without enthusiasm.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooooo.... kay.&quot; Twilight backed slowly away.</p><p class="double"><i>As if I needed a reminder that every pony in this town is crazy...</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.12 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;SURPRISE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Most of Ponyville crowded in the Golden Oaks, as usual, for Pinkie&#039;s usual Welcome-to-Ponyville-Twilight-Sparkle party.</p><p class="double">Most of Ponyville and, over in the corner, one other.</p><p class="double">Ah, Twilight thought, that&#039;s where the other ping came from. &quot;Welcome to Equestria,&quot; Twilight greeted the visiting Looper. &quot;I&#039;m honored to have you in my library.&quot;</p><p class="double">The figure held up a very large burlap sack, currently empty except for the banana held in the same grip. &quot;Ook. Ook eek ook,&quot; he said urgently.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you heard about Tirek. Well, thank you very much,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;but the problem&#039;s more or less under control now. All the books are backed up long before that part of the baseline. I even keep a card catalog in case of Loop-specific variant-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;EEK ook ook! Ooook ook&quot; The strange figure&#039;s gestures became more urgent.</p><p class="double">&quot;I agree, no harm in redundancy. I&#039;m just saying there&#039;s plenty of time, and right now isn&#039;t the best-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooooook.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, better safe than sorry, but could you at least wait until Pinkie serves the cake before you start emptying the shelves?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s banana upside-down cake!&quot; Pinkie Pie added, popping out over Twilight&#039;s shoulder just long enough to announce the fact before bouncing off elsewhere.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oook ook.&quot; The red-furred figure dropped the sack while retaining his grip on the banana. With an awkward swaying gait it shambled towards the refreshments table.</p><p class="double">Not for the first time, Twilight Sparkle wondered if there was any way short of improper Admin interference to speed up the Looper grapevine. Helpfulness was nice, and every bibliophile in the Loops was honored to host the Librarian... but....!</p><p class="double"><i>Memo to self: buy extra towels, and put the town plumber on permanent retainer for the clogs...</i></p><p class="double"><i>And ask non-Awake Applejack if she has any cousins in the banana trade that sell in bulk. </i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.13 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, are these backwards?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry Punch rolled her eyes. &quot;Nope!

Yes Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why is Celestia a smelly cloud-hopping shipper that never seems to go on a date herself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I blame the booze.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.15 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Filthy Rich adjusted his tie as the carriage rolled to a stop and stepped out, smiling as the school bell rang. A crowd of foals emerged from Cheerilee&#039;s humble little building, and through them he caught sight of his little princes.</p><p class="double">...who was, apparently, more of a princess than usual.</p><p class="double">After a moment of staring, Rich managed to regain control of himself and step forward. &quot;Ah, Diamond? Why, exactly, do you have wings and a horn?&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara blushed. &quot;Well, you see, I had a two-for-one coupon...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.16 (via Masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Dash tried, once again, to stuff her shoes into her bulging locker. &quot;Tree damn it... didn&#039;t think this through when I decided to take all those sports clubs at once.&quot;</p><p class="double">She sat back, sighing, then contemplated the four pairs of shoes. Track, spiked, indoor and a pair of walking boots for the hill-climbing. Yes, Canterlot High had a hill-climbing club. This time, anyway.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe I should just-&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped. &quot;No, Dashie, no! You can&#039;t do that!&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash looked up. &quot;Why not? I&#039;ve got easily enough space!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You can&#039;t put <i>shoes</i> in your pocket, Dashie!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay.&quot; Dash rubbed the bridge of her nose. &quot;I&#039;ll bite. <i>Why</i> can&#039;t I?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie beamed. &quot;Shoes have soles!&quot;</p><p class="double">After a pause, Dash pulled her locker open, and grabbed her towel as the rest spilled out. Then she threw the towel at Pinkie. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.17</p><p class="double">Spike yawned, stretched, and checked for other loopers.</p><p class="double">First off, his Loyalty power. Reaching for that, and with a moment&#039;s rush of warmth through his body as the magic reminded him how he&#039;d earned it in the first place, he checked in mentally on each of his friends.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay. Rarity, and... huh. Just Rarity.</i></p><p class="double">That <i>was</i> unusual. Presumably there was an Anchor somewhere – a stealth Anchor, possibly, but it was hard to tell – and since Twilight was her usual self from the baseline, there was no immediate indication that anything would go differently whatsoever.</p><p class="double">A quick ping received only one reply – Rarity&#039;s, of course – so it looked like it probably <i>was</i> stealth Anchor time.</p><p class="double">Finishing his early-loop check, Spike sat down and wrote a letter. It was short, and finished by the time Twilight arrived, so he didn&#039;t have to explain it to her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was her usual flustered self, insisting that Nightmare Moon would be a potential danger – quite accurate, of course – and had Spike write a letter. He did so, then sent both it and his other missive off in two bursts of dragonfire.</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s reply arrived quite promptly, and sent Twilight off to Ponyville as usual. While Twilight was grumbling about this, Spike burped discreetly and snatched another reply out of the air.</p><p class="double">“Has she sent another reply, Spike?” Twilight asked, voice hopeful.</p><p class="double">“Nope, sorry,” Spike answered, and managed quite a convincing hiccup. “I think I just ate too much earlier....”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Twilight wilted slightly, then got on with packing.</p><p class="double">While she was trying to choose which twenty books to take with her as light reading, Spike unfolded the second reply and scanned through it.</p><p class="double"><i>Agreed. See you soon, love.</i></p><p class="double">He smiled, then went over to remind Twilight that there&#039;d be a library where she was going.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was nostalgic, watching as the events of the baseline played out all over again.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie was as excited as ever, of course, and Fluttershy had the same I-don&#039;t-want-to-offend-anybody attitude which had earned her the Element of Kindness in the first place. Dash was – well, Dash, and Applejack&#039;s family just as pleasant as ever.</p><p class="double">Things went a little different in the Boutique, though.</p><p class="double">“And...” Twilight consulted her list. “This is Rarity, who&#039;s doing the decorations. I hope she can sort out my hair...”</p><p class="double">The door opened to Twilight&#039;s polite knock.</p><p class="double">“Good afternoon, and welcome to the-” Rarity began, then trailed off. “Hello.”</p><p class="double">Spike looked up at her, and blushed. (It wasn&#039;t hard – she was, after all, someone he was looking forward to meeting. Quite a lot.) “Um... hi.”</p><p class="double">“Spike?” Twilight asked. “Spike! Twilight to Spike are you alright?”</p><p class="double">Spike ignored her. On the outside, at least. Inside he was trying not to giggle.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sorry about this,” Twilight said to Rarity. “He sometimes gets like this with a unicorn from the Academy...” Twilight finally realized that Rarity wasn&#039;t listening either. “Okay, what&#039;s going on?”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re beautiful,” Spike finally said, in a distant tone. “Marry me?”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at him incredulously.</p><p class="double">“Of course,” Rarity replied. “Tomorrow?”</p><p class="double">Twilight transferred her look of shock to the Ponyville unicorn. “Za?”</p><p class="double">“Why wait?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“Okay, okay, okay. WHAT?” Twilight&#039;s mane toinged out. “Am I the <i>only</i> one who has no idea what&#039;s going on?”</p><p class="double">“Yes!” both Loopers said in unison.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s love at first sight,” Spike added.</p><p class="double">“Indeed it is, darling,” Rarity replied. “Oh, what&#039;s your name?”</p><p class="double">“Spykoranuvellitar.” The syllables rolled off Spike&#039;s tongue. “And you, beautiful?”</p><p class="double">Rarity giggled. “Rarity Belle, handsome.”</p><p class="double">Twilight gaped for a second, then swallowed. “Okay, I-” A pause. “Can you-” Pause. “At least get to know one another!”</p><p class="double">The two stared at one another for a few seconds, then Spike reluctantly tore his eyes away. “Do we have to?”</p><p class="double">The plea had just the right plaintiveness to make the whole situation even more ridiculous. Out of the corner of his eye, Spike saw that Rarity was barely restraining a giggling fit.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Twilight began to walk up and down between them. “First, you&#039;d actually <i>proposed</i> to her before you even knew her name! Second, you&#039;ve known her for less than, what, three minutes? Third, she doesn&#039;t know <i>you</i> either, fourth you&#039;re nowhere <i>near</i> sixteen-”</p><p class="double">“Okay, fine,” Spike agreed, sighing hugely. “Want a date this evening, Rarity?”</p><p class="double">“My pleasure,” Rarity replied instantly. “Dinner and a dance?”</p><p class="double">“The pleasure&#039;s all mine,” Spike protested. “Done. Seven?”</p><p class="double">“Suits me.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked back and forth, then threw up her forelegs. “I don&#039;t even know what&#039;s going on any more.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was <i>hilarious</i>,” Spike said later, over pudding.</p><p class="double">“Indeed,” Rarity agreed, before another spoonful of meringue.</p><p class="double">“Think we can keep it up all loop?”</p><p class="double">Before answering, Rarity dabbed at her mouth with a napkin. “I feel <i>certain</i> of it,” she replied with a smile.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What are you writing?” Twilight asked, peering over at Spike.</p><p class="double">“Poetry,” Spike replied, before balling up one of the sheets of paper, throwing it in a metal bin by his desk and setting light to it for good measure. “I&#039;m trying to write Rarity a love poem, but it&#039;s not going well.”</p><p class="double">Twilight managed to avoid a sigh at the reminder of Spike&#039;s &#039;mutual crush&#039; which had appeared out of nowhere, but it was close. “Really? How &#039;not well&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“Not soppy enough,” Spike informed her. “Hmmm... perhaps something about &#039;sober pools of limpid blue surrounded by your eyelashes that shimmer like ebony fire?&#039;”</p><p class="double">The conversation paused for a minute, as Twilight tried to reconcile the ultraviolet prose she&#039;d just heard... from her assistant.</p><p class="double">“Um, okay...” she said, tentatively. “Why do you want to write something that soppy?”</p><p class="double">“Because that way, we can laugh about it on our next date,” Spike replied matter-of-factly. “It&#039;s a hobby.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sis, are you okay?” Sweetie Belle asked. “You&#039;ve been doodling for the last half hour on your ideas notebook.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I&#039;m fine, Sweetie,” Rarity replied, in an airy voice. “I&#039;m just... in love...”</p><p class="double">Sweetie blinked. “Okay. Who is it? Is it a duke or an actor?”</p><p class="double">“Nothing so superficial.” Rarity smiled. “Handsome, yes, but so much more than that. A cultured drake, a dragon of many talents, a knight, with pen and sword in accord, with a soul of slow fire!”</p><p class="double">“Er... okay,” Sweetie said. “Sure.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This dragon bothering you, babe?” Spike asked, walking into the dragon cave.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid he&#039;s being an awful lout, dear,” Rarity agreed gratefully. “If you would be so kind?”</p><p class="double">The dragon frowned down at him. “What is this? A baby dragon who loves ponies?”</p><p class="double">“<i>One </i>pony in particular, thank you very much,” Spike returned. He and Rarity shared a fond look, then a kiss.</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” Spike added, after he and Rarity were done for the time being. “You snore. Please stop, or else.”</p><p class="double">The dragon sniggered. “Or else what?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh,” the dragon said, in the Frozen North. “I didn&#039;t know there was a kind of dragon that could do that.”</p><p class="double">At least his treasure had been sent along with him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sorry I couldn&#039;t get you a necklace, dear.” As they walked out of the cave, Spike passed over a half-dozen violets tied together with a cord. “I hope flowers will do.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, how thoughtful!” Rarity selected one and nibbled a petal. “I was feeling peckish after the climb. You&#039;re so thoughtful.”</p><p class="double">“I try,” Spike agreed.</p><p class="double">“Oh, so modest!” Rarity reached up and gently pushed at his spines. “My spiky-wikey.”</p><p class="double">He ran his claws through her mane. “Rarity-warity.”</p><p class="double">They ignored the sound of Rainbow Dash loudly gagging in the background.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, even <i>I </i>think we&#039;re getting a bit treacly,” Rarity admitted. “We should probably just go ahead and show that you can age-shift.”</p><p class="double">“Why <i>even</i> you?” Spike asked, raising an eyebrow. “What is it about you in this? Why can&#039;t it be even for <i>me</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Well, you&#039;re a big manly dragon,” Rarity pointed out. “Though, admittedly, you&#039;re neither at the moment.”</p><p class="double">“Low blow,” Spike chuckled, and poured the tea. “But a frilly apron doesn&#039;t deduct from my masculinity in the slightest!”</p><p class="double">“And why not?” Rarity pressed. </p><p class="double">“Because it&#039;s Nightmare Night,” Spike said. “I mean, I&#039;m dressed up, so it doesn&#039;t count.”</p><p class="double">“Neither of us have gone <i>out</i> for Nightmare Night,” Rarity argued.</p><p class="double">“So?” Spike shrugged. “Still counts.”</p><p class="double">There was a knock at the door.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll get the sweets,” Spike volunteered, putting the teapot down. “You answer the door.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Rarity opened the door, it was to reveal Luna standing there.</p><p class="double">“Oh!” Rarity blinked. “Well, your highness! It&#039;s an honour.”</p><p class="double">“&#039;TIS NOT A PROBLEM,” Luna boomed. “WE WISHED TO ask you a-”</p><p class="double">She broke off, and tapped her throat. “What is this?”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, darling.” Rarity indicated her horn. “It&#039;s a spell I use when Sweetie and her friends are being too loud – and I&#039;m afraid you were most assuredly being too loud.” She shrugged. “Anyway, what was it?”</p><p class="double">“Sweets are here!” Spike announced. “I – oh, Princess!”</p><p class="double">Then he squinted. “Is that a-”</p><p class="double">Luna frowned. “What is it you speak of?”</p><p class="double">“Oh,” Spike frowned, and rephrased. “Is that a possum in your mane?”</p><p class="double">“Ah! Thou dost mean Tibbers.” Luna reached onto her back and retrieved the pet. “He has been a boon companion of mine since shortly after my return to Equestria, ere my first public appearance.” She scratched Tibbers on the back, and he made something approximating a purr.</p><p class="double">Spike held out the bowl. “Does Tibbers want a sweet?”</p><p class="double">There was a blur, and six of the sweets in the bowl vanished.</p><p class="double">Tibbers munched down one of the caramels, reclining lazily on Luna&#039;s hair.</p><p class="double">“He is such a ragamuffyn, is he not?” Luna asked, smiling.</p><p class="double">Spike and Rarity exchanged a glance. As with many couples, it was a whole conversation in one look.</p><p class="double">“Come through here, Luna,” Rarity invited, stepping aside. “I&#039;ll help teach you some class, some culture. Spike can look after Tibbers.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, little guy?” Spike asked. He shook the bowl. “You&#039;ll get more sweets!”</p><p class="double">The possum hopped down from Luna&#039;s back as she and Twilight walked towards the back room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Impressive work, Admiral,” Spike began, as soon as the door had shut.</p><p class="double">Tibbers looked up at him owlishly, then ignored the silly dragon and got back to his sweeties.</p><p class="double">“Doesn&#039;t help, James,” Spike added. “I&#039;m a Jedi, I can tell there&#039;s a sapient in there if I&#039;m really trying.”</p><p class="double">“Well... shoot.” James Tiberius &#039;Tibbers&#039; Kirk, Starship Captain, Admiral of the Fleet (posthumous), more awards and demerits than you could shake a stick at, and part-time possum, abandoned the pretence. “How&#039;d you know?”</p><p class="double">“Bad luck on your part,” Spike replied. “Our normal Anchor isn&#039;t Awake, we&#039;re the only two here, and we know we didn&#039;t cause you to turn up. It could have been a variant, but... well, we were looking for an Anchor anyway.”</p><p class="double">He grinned. “Don&#039;t worry, though, your secret&#039;s safe with us.”</p><p class="double">&#039;Tibbers&#039; considered that, then nodded and made a familiar four-fingered salute. “Works for me.”</p><p class="double">“No problem. Just – look out for Luna, okay?” Spike scratched the back of his neck. “She has a rough time of it before the baseline starts.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I know,” &#039;Tibbers&#039; assured him. “I&#039;ve been here plenty of times. One of my more common loops, actually.”</p><p class="double">Spike absorbed that. “Huh. Well, you&#039;re supposed to be one for meeting all powerful space beings, I suppose.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity snuggled up to Spike as the others left.</p><p class="double">“I think that went quite well,” she informed Spike. “We gradually reduced the power of the spell, and had her try not to get louder as the spell stepped down. She&#039;s only speaking firmly now.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good,” Spike agreed. “Oh – I was right about Tibbers. He&#039;s our guest anchor.”</p><p class="double">“Good eye, Spiky-wikey!” Rarity pecked him on the cheek. “Who was it?”</p><p class="double">“James T. Kirk,” Spike told her, with a broad grin.</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked. “Okay, somehow I feel like that was obvious.”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “I had something to tell you, as well. I managed to wrangle these off Luna when Twilight needed the lavatory.”</p><p class="double">They looked at the signed royal orders.</p><p class="double">They shared a grin.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What are you doing <i>this</i> time, Spike?” Twilight asked, as she walked into the main room. “Is that a parrot?”</p><p class="double">“Phoenix,” Spike replied matter-of-factly. “Rarity and I found the egg on our expedition yesterday. It&#039;s a perfect way to carry my latest message to her!”</p><p class="double">Peewee chirped, looking uncertainly at the asbestos-lined scroll case tied to his leg.</p><p class="double">“Go find Rarity,” Spike instructed. “Go on!”</p><p class="double">The little phoenix frowned, then erupted in flame and vanished.</p><p class="double">“Good enough,” Spike pronounced.</p><p class="double">With a crash, something came through the upstairs window.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The <i>something</i> turned out to be a large, blanket-wrapped bundle. The bundle in turn was a pair of pillows, wrapped around another blanket, wrapped around a sleeping bag, wrapped around an irate Opalescent.</p><p class="double">Spike deftly retrieved a scroll from her back before she destroyed it, and skimmed through it. “Cool, we&#039;re getting married next week.”</p><p class="double">Twilight tripped and fell over.</p><p class="double">“What?” she asked, getting up again. “<i>What</i> did you just say?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Spike passed it over. “Royal order, signed by Princess Luna, stating that Rarity Belle and Spykoranuvellitar may join in wedlock when the order is signed by both other parties, superseding all other laws.” So saying, he scribbled his name down on the sole free line. “Kind of funny, really, I just sent one to her...”</p><p class="double">Twilight could only gape.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...and then I realized,” Cadence continued, gesticulating wildly. “They&#039;re getting married in a week, <i>we&#039;re</i> getting married in a week... how to resolve the conflict?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, dear,” Shining Armor replied. “<i>How</i> to resolve the conflict?”</p><p class="double">Cadence&#039; voice took on a mellifluous quality. “Dou~ble<i> </i>wed~ding...”</p><p class="double">Shining watched, with something that was not quite trepidation, as his lovely bride started dancing. On the wall.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, anyway,” Rarity finished. “Given how much love Cadence naturally puts off, you&#039;re set for life if you can just stay around her. I have these <i>lovely</i> armours designed, so if you&#039;re ready to send the offer we can get you kitted out straight away.”</p><p class="double">“And <i>why</i>, precisely, should I make the Changelings subservient to Equestria?” Chrysalis asked. “Especially personally to a single alicorn?”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Rarity smiled. “One. Cadence doesn&#039;t have a guards corps, so there&#039;s a slot spare. Two. She can feed all of you, as I&#039;ve mentioned. Three. She&#039;s getting married soon, as well you know, which is an excellent time for pageantry. And four. Under the feudal system which Equestrian nobility do still use, as direct vassals of a Princess you&#039;d be the primary-ranked noble in Equestria short of them themselves... and your wellbeing would become her responsibility.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis pondered that, considering her desperate situation. Her dwindling resources. Her pride. And the clear, melodious sincerity of the unicorn before her.</p><p class="double">“...all right. Give me that paper.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that worked out rather better than I was expecting,” Spike admitted, as the Love Guard made&nbsp;&nbsp;formation and marched counterstep across the state, revealing their new liege to her groom. “Job well done, I think.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” Rarity replied, pouring herself some champagne. “Solving problems through fashion <i>is</i> my speciality.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">109.18</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Vinyl began. “So, I made this sound deck which repeats things using tape loops, and then <i>this</i> one takes that, transcribes it onto a record, then reads it off straight away just to get the purely authentic crackle, and <i>this</i> one will constantly monitor the results from the unbiased point of view of a purely mathematical algorithm dedicated to finding better music, and this one-”</p><p class="double">“I get the point,” Octavia interrupted. “It plays great music. Right. What happens if you switch it all on?”</p><p class="double">Seeing Vinyl glance over at the controls, Octavia gestured. “Go on, I&#039;m honestly curious now.”</p><p class="double">“Well... sure.” Vinyl tapped a few switches, then moved the power control to <i>on</i>.</p><p class="double">The whole edifice creaked for a few seconds, then began to produce sound.</p><p class="double">“...well, it&#039;s very nice,” Octavia said, after a few minutes. “But what&#039;s a submarine, why is it yellow, and who are all living in it?”</p><p class="double">Vinyl gave her new machine a scowl. “I&#039;m going to need to give this thing another look over.”</p><p class="double">It certainly wasn&#039;t supposed to just play Beatles hits, and she hadn&#039;t worked out how to stop it yet... </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>110.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The library door opened.</p><p class="double">“Afternoon, Twilight,” Cheerilee said, walking in with a kind of elemental determination. This fixation was only hampered by her spotting Nyx, who she waved to before continuing on her advance.</p><p class="double">“Um...” Twilight watched as the teacher trotted up to her, and stopped directly in front of her at a distance of about two feet. “Can I help you?”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee nodded, and shook her mane. A very, very large ledger dropped out of her mane with a <i>SLAM</i>, raising dust as it hit the floor.</p><p class="double">“That book,” Cheerilee began, “is a checklist. It is incomplete. It is a list of every single field of study that I could think of, and I have been compiling it for the past four loops.”</p><p class="double">“...okay,” Twilight said, picking up the book and opening it. <i>Aardvark biology, Abacus use, Abbey construction and maintenance-</i></p><p class="double">“Is this alphabetical? All the way through?”</p><p class="double">“No, I kept thinking of new ones. Anyway.” Cheerilee looked Twilight in the eye. “I believe I have worked out how to avoid my continual case of Cutie Mark Failure Syndrome. I wish to be able to give a basic course in <i>every single one</i> of these subjects.”</p><p class="double">Thunder rolled.</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Nyx,” she added, glancing over to where the young alicorn was putting a thundercloud away. “I think you&#039;re going to do well in drama club this year.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks!”</p><p class="double">Twilight had taken the opportunity to think Cheerilee&#039;s plan over. “Well... it&#039;s certainly quite grandiose, I have to admit. Are you sure?”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee nodded firmly. “Yes. I want to be able to teach whatever someone wants to learn, and to make sure there&#039;s always something to teach anyone.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Twilight mentally ran through a few ideas. “Well, I <i>think</i> there are some places which have flash learning equipment, but I&#039;ve never been interested in trying it. You might want to give that a go. Until then, however, we should do it the old fashioned way.” She called upstairs. “Spike!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah?” Spike called back down.</p><p class="double">“Can you tell Fluttershy to come over, please? It&#039;s not urgent, but sooner would be better.”</p><p class="double">“Aardvarks?” Cheerilee checked.</p><p class="double">“Aardvarks,” Twilight confirmed. “May as well start at the beginning.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And here she is,” the Mayor announced. “Princess Celestia!”</p><p class="double">What stepped out onto the stage was not, however, Princess Celestia.</p><p class="double">Perhaps more surprisingly, nor was it Princess Luna. It wasn&#039;t even her dark self, or the looping version of said dark self.</p><p class="double">The ponies of Ponyville panicked, running for the exits, as a huge red-black dragon crawled up onto the stage and roared. Its spines shook, and it flashed into flame.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s-” Twilight began, surprised, then sighed and facehoofed. “Of course. Nightmare.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy was already trotting determinedly up the steps. “Hello, big guy.”</p><p class="double">The dragon snarled once more, then looked down at her.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay,” Fluttershy said, her face and manner serene. “No-pony here&#039;s going to hurt you.”</p><p class="double">After a moment, the Monstrous Nightmare relaxed. Its eyes widened out from fight-or-flight slits into calmer circles, and it allowed her to gently touch it.</p><p class="double"><i>Where am I?</i> it asked. <i>The last I remember, Snotlout was putting me to bed. But I can&#039;t feel him. Is this a new Loop?</i></p><p class="double">Twilight trotted over. “Are you... I think it was... Hookfang?”</p><p class="double"><i>Yes. Hello.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head helplessly. This was going to be interesting...</p><p class="double"><i>I saw another pony like you, but one with wings,</i> he added. <i>She sent me down here to attack.</i></p><p class="double">“Did she look like this?” Twilight asked, producing an image of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double"><i>Almost, but her hair was a bit lighter and her eyes weren&#039;t slit shaped.</i></p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight absorbed that, wondering what it meant. “Okay, I think the best thing is for you to go with Fluttershy. She&#039;s good at taking care of animals, and you sort of count.”</p><p class="double"><i>Thank you.</i> Hookfang followed Fluttershy off the stage, stepping carefully around the chairs strewn across the floor.</p><p class="double"><i>Poor guy,</i> Twilight thought, with a sigh. Dragons who had the Pernese bond ability, from what she knew, found it very disorienting not to have their Riders present unless they were used to it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you <i>sure</i> this is a dragon?” Snotlout asked, looking at what was – apparently – his mount for the loop.</p><p class="double">“Look,” the winged unicorn horse retorted, in a high pitched voice. “I don&#039;t get it either, okay? Just be glad I&#039;m letting you ride me in the first place, I&#039;m not comfortable with people on my back...”</p><p class="double">“Ergh, this is gonna look ridiculous.” Snotlout bowed to the inevitable, and started checking his not-a-dragon&#039;s harness. “At least tell me your name.”</p><p class="double">“Nyx.” The horse frowned down at his handiwork. “Are you sure that&#039;s the right kind of buckle?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah, I&#039;ve been doing this for yonks,” Snotlout replied. “Loki&#039;s teeth, I should have known something was up when I had a Lunar Nightmare instead of a Monstrous one...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, hey! Hi, Fluttershy!”</p><p class="double">The indicated pegasus looked over her shoulder. “Oh – good morning, Vinyl. Did you Wake up late?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, exactly on time,” Vinyl replied. “Same time as you. Anyway, I had a quick favour to ask.”</p><p class="double">“Go on,” Fluttershy invited.</p><p class="double">“Okay, it&#039;s back home. Follow me...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Anyway,” Vinyl got back to the point. “I Woke up this loop and found I had a pet. And, well, I didn&#039;t know any vets before I Awoke, so I never had him checked up. I just thought, you know, Fluttershy&#039;s not busy now the modelling career&#039;s stopped, so I could get her to do it. If that&#039;s cool, that is.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it&#039;s no trouble.” Fluttershy examined the small bat, currently dangling from his perch. “Well, he certainly looks like a fine specimen... what&#039;s his name?”</p><p class="double">“Didn&#039;t have one when I Woke, so I&#039;m just calling him MiniMoog.” Fluttershy shot her a glance, and Vinyl shrugged. “It&#039;s a joke that only like three ponies in this whole loop will get – me, Lyra, Sweetie, and possibly Twilight or Applebloom. Anyways... he&#039;s kinda cool. Watch. Hey, MiniMoog!”</p><p class="double">The bat chirruped sleepily, then dropped off his perch, spread wings, and swooped up into a hover before hitting the ground.</p><p class="double">“He can do loads of cool stuff,” Vinyl said, putting a glass on the table. “Hey, MiniMoog – swan!”</p><p class="double">MiniMoog the bat chirped at the glass a couple of times, then emitted a high, pure note.</p><p class="double">The glass cracked, then exploded in a cloud of fine sand. In the resultant pile of sand was a sculpture of a swan in repose, neck arched and wings swept back.</p><p class="double">“Wow,” Fluttershy said quietly, and the bat did a loop-de-loop.</p><p class="double">“He sings along to my music,” Vinyl confided. “Or he sometimes just sings something and, like, vanishes. Not just in sound, either, it&#039;s like the air around him shimmers.”</p><p class="double">“That sounds very interesting,” Fluttershy complimented. “MiniMoog, can you show me that please?”</p><p class="double">MiniMoog began to sing, and – <i>blurred</i>.</p><p class="double">“I think I see,” Fluttershy said eventually. Then she cleared her throat, and began to speak in a language of ultrasonic clicks and warbles that drew a startled look from Vinyl.</p><p class="double"><u>“Hello,”</u> she began. <u>“Am I speaking to a Looper?”</u></p><p class="double">MiniMoog cancelled his cloak of sound, and looked at her. Then he nodded. <u>“Yes. I&#039;m called Shade Silverwing.”</u></p><p class="double">Fluttershy clapped her hooves together in an uncharacteristic display of delight. <u>“Lovely! I wondered if it was you.”</u></p><p class="double">“Uh, dude and dudette,” Vinyl raised a hoof. “I don&#039;t speak bat. What&#039;s goin&#039; on?”</p><p class="double"><u>“Well-”</u> Fluttershy coughed. “Sorry. Well, this is Shade Silverwing. He&#039;s a looper – in fact, I believe he&#039;s an Anchor.”</p><p class="double"><u>“MiniMoog is fine, though,”</u> Shade added. <u>“She&#039;s right, it</u><u><i> is </i></u><u>a good joke.”</u></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.4 </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Berry said, taking a deep breath. “You ready for this?”</p><p class="double">“Ready as you are,” Discord replied, sitting on the wall.</p><p class="double">Berry downed her Agaric Ale. “Okay, just remember those ground rules.”</p><p class="double">The draconequus rolled his eyes, getting a seven. “Yes, I know, I know. Nothing more permanent than twelve hours, plus another twelve if you haven&#039;t woken up yet.”</p><p class="double">She nodded. “Good.” A pause. “And Ruby?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s staying over at Derpy&#039;s now.” Discord winked. “As is her room.”</p><p class="double">“I wondered about the hole,” Berry admitted, her eyes unfocusing. “Cool, now there&#039;s a flying reindeer coming through it.”</p><p class="double">Discord snapped his claws, and a flying reindeer duly appeared coming through the hole.</p><p class="double">As a magical construct, it wasn&#039;t actually alive and was controlled purely by Discord&#039;s subconscious. As a weird bloke, Discord&#039;s subconscious promptly made the reindeer scream something about &#039;for Rudolph&#039;, crash into the table, and fall unconscious.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Dissy?” Berry asked. “What&#039;s got four eyes and six limbs?”</p><p class="double">“Princess Luna wearing glasses?” Discord replied, pulling her out of a drawer.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I was hoping you knew,” Berry said sadly. “Because one wants to be my friend, and it&#039;s getting&nbsp;&nbsp;drool on the carpet.”</p><p class="double">“Not Luna, then...” Discord pushed her back into the drawer, over her protests, and created a six-limbed four-eyed creature on the carpet. “Just throw a frisbee for it.”</p><p class="double">“All I&#039;ve got is this frying pan,” Berry protested.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, seriously, <i>what the hay</i> were you two doing?” Twilight demanded.</p><p class="double">“Trying to work out if Dissy is legitimately more bizarre than tripping,” Berry replied, seriously. “Inconclusive results, though.”</p><p class="double">Discord snored on the floor.</p><p class="double">“Plus, I think I actually tired him out trying to keep up with me,” Berry gauged. “Just use a failsafe spell, that should sort it all out.”</p><p class="double">Twilight pulled a flying squid off her forehead. “Was this one of yours or one of his?”</p><p class="double">“Mine, I think,” Berry answered, frowning. “That or he misinterpreted &#039;inkjet printer&#039;.”</p><p class="double">The squid spat a stream of ink at the table, producing a perfectly typeset document about the Rights Of Pony.</p><p class="double">“Ah, must be the second one.” Berry nodded sagely.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Claws grated on bronze, punched halfway through, then slid off.</p><p class="double">“Got to try harder than that!” Scootaloo called, letting her bucklers reform themselves from cloudstuff.</p><p class="double">“Heh, I&#039;m just getting warmed up!” Gilda reached into nothing, which turned into a large shield made of over a dozen smaller metal bits. The shield disassembled into its component parts, hovered for a moment, then began orbiting her. “Try <i>this</i> on for size!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo nodded. “I intend to.” One hoof formed a <i>hoplon</i> shield, the other a <i>dory</i>. The spear wavered around in small movements, probing for an opening, then jabbed forward.</p><p class="double">“Whoa!” Gilda hopped up and the spear barely missed her. The components of the Infinity Judge then wrapped around the <i>dory</i>, which promptly vanished.</p><p class="double">The griffin took the opportunity to summon a second weapon – a set of beads, rusty red in colour – and then faced Scootaloo directly, her tail moving in precise shapes.</p><p class="double">“Hey, we said no casting!” Scootaloo protested, as a half-dozen bolts of coherent magic ink spattered on her shield. One skittered off her helmet.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s the weapon ability,” Gilda replied with a grin. “Read the manual.”</p><p class="double">“In that case...” Scootaloo whirled around on one hoof, and threw half a dozen javelins. Halfway to their target, they all caught fire.</p><p class="double">“Gah!” The beads snapped out, breaking two javelins. Infinity Judge blocked three more, and the last trimmed Gilda&#039;s lock of feathers just over her beak.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re gonna regret that, Scoots...” Gilda made two sharp gestures, and her beads and shield vanished.</p><p class="double">In place of Infinity Judge on her back, a simple tarnished mirror with a corona of trailing fire.</p><p class="double">In place of the Life Beads, a dozen teardrops with the frost of a midwinter&#039;s night on their surfaces.</p><p class="double">And, in both clawed forelimbs, a sword snapping lightning bolts in every direction.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo&#039;s jaw dropped. “Seriously? <i>Three?</i>”</p><p class="double">Gilda nodded, one wing wiping a sheen of sweat off her forehead. “I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s easy to run all three at once, but – good luck, squirt!”</p><p class="double">The beads fired out like a shotgun blast, just ahead of the enraged griffin and her big pointy sword.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rummaged through what she could legally do in this duel, looking for a reprieve-</p><p class="double"><i>Oh.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Yeah, that&#039;d work.</i></p><p class="double">Four slingstones blurred out from her spinning tail, knocking two beads each off course. The remaining four bounced off her <i>hoplon</i>, thrown like a discus at the same moment.</p><p class="double">A <i>falx</i>, swung in both forelegs now they were free, deflected the sparking Thunder Edge, and a <i>kopis</i> sword crossed with the <i>falx</i> to arrest it entirely.</p><p class="double">“So, what&#039;s your plan for when the beads recharge?” Gilda asked, pushing with all her might to force Scootaloo back.</p><p class="double">The young pegasus grinned. “This.”</p><p class="double">At that point, a <i>tessarakonteres</i> landed on top of Gilda with a splintering crash.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Yeah, it <i>was</i> basically cheating,” Scootaloo admitted. “I did have to get Pansy to construct it, especially that far off. But – hey, treat it as me conceding you&#039;d won.”</p><p class="double">“Not talking to you,” Gilda replied sulkily, staring into her retsina.</p><p class="double">“Told you the drink was good,” Scootaloo continued. “Hay, I paid for it, right?”</p><p class="double">Gilda gave Scootaloo a <i>look</i>. Then downed her glass. “Tastes like resin.”</p><p class="double">“Kinda is,” Scootaloo confirmed. “There&#039;s pine resin in there, I think... in other words, tree sap.”</p><p class="double">That just earned her another <i>look</i>.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.6</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon trotted onto the stage, and spread her wings. “Tremble in fear, mortals! The Night Will Last Forever!”</p><p class="double">The mayor cleared her throat. “Er, excuse me. Are you – Nightmare Moon?”</p><p class="double">Said alicorn turned. “Indeed I am. What of it, functionary?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I represent a fiscal firm – Great Investations. We were the ones who handled your finances while you were away.”</p><p class="double">“I have <i>finances</i>?” Nightmare Moon blinked. “I would have thought &#039;twas all confiscated.”</p><p class="double">“Most of it was, most of it was.” Ivory permitted herself a thin smile. “But our team has represented the best for over a thousand years, and we managed to save seed money of one million bits. Since then, we have invested it in a diverse portfolio which has shown a 1% return on investment annualized over the last thousand years, showing a Sharp-Investor ratio of 2.4 – which is very competitive.”</p><p class="double">“I... see,” Nightmare Moon said, to cover that she didn&#039;t. “And what does that actually <i>mean</i>?”</p><p class="double">Ivory passed over a slip of paper. “The current value of the portfolio.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s eyes widened. “That is – a very big number. Approximately twenty-one milliards?”</p><p class="double">“Correct.” Ivory nodded. “A little goes a long way, over a long time.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent,” Nightmare Moon announced. “Truly an impressive achievement! Now-”</p><p class="double">“One moment, milady,” Ivory interrupted. “There is the matter of investment tax.”</p><p class="double">“Tax?” Nightmare Moon&#039;s eyes took on a slightly hunted look. “<i>Tax</i> applies to estates?”</p><p class="double">“Since three-sixty-three, yes. That would be... about three hundred and fifty four years after we took over the account upon your banishment, if I have the calculations right.” Ivory indicated a very thick ledger. “Fortunately, through some loopholes, we were able to minimize the impact on your estate. The investment itself was untouched, and the tax was only on the interest – at nothing for the first twenty thousand bits, then one percent for the next thirty thousand, and two percent after that. Negligible impact on the actual value of the portfolio, of course.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” Nightmare Moon echoed, looking completely lost. “So?”</p><p class="double">“Well, our normal practice is simply to forward the tax assessment task to the exchequer, and leave it at that. However, since there was no tax actually being paid, it became arrears. And the interest on arrears comes to five percent per annum. So you owe this much.”</p><p class="double">A second, rather longer slip of paper. This one had a very, very large number on it.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s jaw dropped, and her lips moved silently.</p><p class="double">“I checked it myself,” Ivory added earnestly. “Twice. Special service.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Eleven trillion, seven hundred and eighty one billiard, four hundred and seventeen billion, eight hundred and sixty eight milliard&nbsp;&nbsp;one hundred and thirteen million, seven hundred thousand bits!?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Plus eight bits fifty for doing the assessment,” Ivory pointed out helpfully.</p><p class="double">It didn&#039;t actually help, though. Nightmare Moon had fainted dead away.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.7</p><p class="double">“Good morning, Angel!” Fluttershy called. “The sun is shining, the birds are singing, it&#039;s a new Loop, and – I know you&#039;re Awake, you silly bunny!”</p><p class="double">Angel made a singularly unconcerned noise, and flipped a rude gesture at Fluttershy as he turned over back to bed.</p><p class="double">“Now, now,” Fluttershy chided him. “That&#039;s thoroughly impolite of you, Angel. And-” she paused, blinked, then frowned. “Hold on. Are you okay?”</p><p class="double">Angel did not respond audibly, but Fluttershy got the gist anyway.</p><p class="double">“Oh, you poor thing...” Fluttershy bent down. “I&#039;m sorry, I know what that&#039;s like.”</p><p class="double">The rabbit made a complicated paw signal.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, and trotted over to the windows. Curtains dropped down across each one, and then a big CLOSED sign went on the door.</p><p class="double">“There you go,” she informed him. “Now, come here.”</p><p class="double">Angel dragged himself out of bed, walked slowly across to Fluttershy, and allowed her to gently pick him up.</p><p class="double">“There, there,” Fluttershy soothed. “I know, it hurts when that sort of thing happens.”</p><p class="double">Angel nodded silently.</p><p class="double">For perhaps a minute, neither broke the embrace.</p><p class="double">“Um... if you don&#039;t mind my asking,” Fluttershy began, frowning. “Who was it?”</p><p class="double">Angel pulled a foreleg free. A few seconds rummaging in his Pocket, and he handed over a book.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I remember this world.” Fluttershy skimmed through that volume in particular, then raised an eyebrow. “The Honorary Rosemary?”</p><p class="double">Angel nodded.</p><p class="double">“Were you replacing Tark?”</p><p class="double">Another nod. Angel retrieved a length of yellow cloth embroidered with pink flowers, and wrapped it around his head bandana-style.</p><p class="double">On the cloth were small words, picked out in black thread:</p><p class="double"><i>Property Rosemary Woodsorrel of Salamandastron.</i></p><p class="double">Angel adjusted it slightly, then gave Fluttershy a look of laserlike intensity that promised one thing and one thing only.</p><p class="double">“Oh, don&#039;t be such a silly bunny!” Fluttershy admonished. “Of course it&#039;s none of their business. My lips are sealed.”</p><p class="double">The glare continued for a further few seconds, and then Angel nodded his thanks.</p><p class="double">With the moment over, Fluttershy removed the sign and pulled all the curtains back.</p><p class="double">It <i>was</i> a nice day, after all.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.8</p><p class="double">“And with that, I&#039;m in a position for All Your Base, which will Belong To Me shortly. That&#039;s my turn,” Gilda said, taking off everyone else&#039;s zigs.</p><p class="double">The first of her opponents made a squeaking noise.</p><p class="double">“Tibbers says he&#039;s going to challenge you to a fist fight, and he&#039;s playing his special – What Does God Need With A Starship,” Fluttershy translated. “That means that you have to use your basic character without any mods applied, or he gets to shoot you with klingons.”</p><p class="double">“Not a problem!” Gilda replied, turning a card over. “Because it&#039;s Freaky Friday, so now I&#039;m actually <i>his </i>character-” she gestured to her right, “-until the end of the turn. Have fun being kicked around by a possum, matey!”</p><p class="double">Q said something <i>literally</i> unpronounceable, and vanished in a flash of light.</p><p class="double">“Does that count as a forfeit?” the final player asked.</p><p class="double">“Eh.” Discord shrugged. “I think so, because he refused my pizza last night, and because rules adjudications are made<i> solely </i>on petty vendettas when Luna&#039;s paperwork backlog is over four inches high.”</p><p class="double">“Good.” That final player drew a card, placed it carefully into his hand, and then played another one. “Prime Directive. I&#039;m the only one who can act until I do something directly inimical to lesser races, and such an act has to be confirmed by the Federation high command – which means a fifty turn lag time.”</p><p class="double">Gilda gaped. “How the heck did you manage <i>that?</i>”</p><p class="double">Jean-Luc Picard smiled. The smile was not broad, but profoundly zen. “Happiness makes the world go round, but ten turns doing nothing but stockpiling bureaucratic red tape counters can make it stop completely until a permit is issued. In triplicate.”</p><p class="double">“Damnit. Well, I guess that&#039;s game. Nice work on the sci fi expansion, Discord.” Gilda glanced out the window. “Now, how do we get back to the Enterprise?”</p><p class="double">“You tell me, lieutenant.” Picard shrugged. “You <i>are</i> my security officer, after all.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but my sense of direction&#039;s not as good as Worf&#039;s is. Not navigating around some kind of crazy time-outside-space, anyway.”</p><p class="double">Discord spread his arms expansively. “Ask and you shall receive.”</p><p class="double">“We didn&#039;t ask,” Gilda reminded him.</p><p class="double">“Well, yes, but the ship&#039;s counsellor did.” Discord sketched a bow to Fluttershy. “She&#039;s much more polite than you lot.”</p><p class="double">“Eh, fair enough, we&#039;ll take what we can get.” Gilda then grinned. “Hey, I just got an idea. Want to come along with us, Tibbers?”</p><p class="double">The animal – Kirk, of course – gave her a quizzical look.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s simple. We program your real identity into the computer, make sure it&#039;s locked out, and &#039;shy keeps you around as her pet.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Picard nodded. “So, in times of crisis when I am incapacitated, command will automatically devolve on what amounts to the ship&#039;s cat.”</p><p class="double">Gilda sharpened her claws casually. “I&#039;m kinda proud of it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.9</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">((Compiled by Masterweaver.

Though I really liked that one loop where we swapped places and nobody was willing to admit the difference.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled. &quot;Sometimes I randomly swap with other me.&quot;</p><p class="double">The loopers digested it before Discord asked the obvious question. &quot;So which Pinkie Pie are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie, silly!&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra contemplated. &quot;Well, setting myself as a Looper is my most <i>impressive</i> trick... but one time, I figured out how to get people through without them transforming, talked to the high school theatre group, and convinced all of Canterlot that Celestia had all but exterminated humans in the distant past and covered it up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia flinched. &quot;That... is admittedly true, some loops, but I&#039;m never proud of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that was a bureau loop actually. Most of your power was dogma, not literal brainwashing, so....&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head. &quot;Oh, I remember that one. The battle of Baltimare was over in ten minutes, I think.&quot;</p><p class="double">Derpy tossed a peanut in the air and caught it in her mouth. &quot;I figured out how to get the sports channel on it!&quot; She grinned, munching. &quot;You can tune in on any sporting event you want, though it burns out after about twenty minutes if you try and watch a championship.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie pulled a wooden staff with three faces carved into it out of her pocket. &quot;Open portal, insert Wabbajack, fire wildly, question mark, profit!&quot; she giggled. She seemed not to notice as everyone, Discord included, started scooting away slowly until she put it back in storage.</p><p class="double">Lyra just glared. &quot;That was you!? You turned me into a sweet roll!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I regret nothing!&quot; Pinkie sang teasingly.</p><p class="double">&quot;When the other Pinkie was next to me!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;...&#039;</i> said a voice in Lyra&#039;s head.

Ah never really messed around with the mirror, but ah do get bored now an&#039; again.&quot; he shrugged. &quot;Did ya&#039; know the knights are shaped like <i>horses</i> over there? Darndest thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie harumphed ostentatiously. &quot;I dropped it into the Mirror Pool to see what would happen.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was silence as everyone waited for the showmare to speak. Finally, Applejack couldn&#039;t take the dramatic tension any more.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what did happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie sighed. &quot;Standard Trixie outcome number four. Loop crash, then Eiken.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle gave a nervous chuckle. &quot;Well, you know how the right note can shatter glass?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset boggled at her for a moment before nodding. &quot;I thought I heard someone singing before the statue exploded. Don&#039;t worry, I put up a shield before anyone could get hurt.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie sagged with relief. &quot;I&#039;m just glad I didn&#039;t blow up that whole universe. Again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing!&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl Scratch looked thoughtful. &quot;I wish to admit that I actually know the sonic resonance of the Mirror Gate...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Everyone else asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s hard to do epic wubs across two universes if you crack the gate...&quot; she explained.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis smirked. &quot;Magical girls.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I used a few objects from others loops and fake changelings attacks to make your human versions believe they were magical girls protecting the world.&quot; She giggled. &quot;They never noticed that I was the villain <i>and</i> the animal companion.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...like Kyubey?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NO!! Nobody was harmed, they had fun, my changelings feed off the adoration that the people had for their new heroes, and human Rainbow Dash got better grades that in baseline.&quot; She looked at her mug. &quot;The hard part was keep the army and the government away... other loops have it so easy.&quot;</p><p class="double">She thought for a second. &quot;Although... There was also the time I stole the Mirror Gate, used the Mirror Pool to create an infinite army of Changeling clones, outfitted them in stormtrooper armor, and conquered the human world.&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone stared at her for several awkward seconds before Trixie asked, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">She shrugged, &quot;I was kinda bored. We had a stealth anchor and no one else was awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Twilight began. &quot;I once Pocketed the mirror from one Loop and calibrated it to the same portal in the next. There were a number of... <i>Interesting</i> results.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Such as?&quot; Rarity inquired.</p><p class="double">&quot;Intersecting one mirror with the other made some neat fractals. Bringing the spare to the human world basically made it a point to point wormhole. Keeping both mirrors in Equestria is where things got weird. Anything coming back from the human world got duplicated, just like the mirror pool, but going the other way turned out to be... Unwise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it worked fine if you went through on your own, but if a fly happened to pass through the other portal while you did...&quot; The revelation was met by a round of cringes by the other Loopers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I think we all know my favorite shenanigans with that thing came from the time Sunset and I convinced Celestia I&#039;d turned all the humans into ponies and made them forget about it.&quot; Discord picked up his wine glass, frowned, snapped his fingers, then drank a sip of water before continuing. &quot;But a close second would have to be the time I went through, revealed my phenomenal cosmic power to the world, announced that I was so impressed by humans&#039; chaotic nature that I had decided to enter retirement, then spent the rest of the loop in Hollywood as a recurring villain in <i>Star Wars: The Next Republic.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance giggled. &quot;I once got every pony legally married to their human counterpart!&quot;</p><p class="double">A number of the other loopers sidled slowly away from her.</p><p class="double">Sunset chuckled. &quot;My best trick with the mirror was me deciding to pretend it was a gateway to Tartarus, after I left a guitar pick and spread a rumor it was a demon&#039;s tooth which&#039;d make the user a rock and roll master. That world&#039;s Trixie and Rainbow Dash found it, and broke it. I picked it up, and the fun began!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike groaned, seeing where this was going. &quot;You were wanting to do a version of &#039;Beelzeboss&#039;, weren&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset nodded. &quot;Guilty as charged. What? It&#039;s a good song. Helped that they basically walked right into the setup...and before you guys ask, Transformation Jutsu to look like that form I had when I put on the crown.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna giggled. &quot;I Woke Up really early, just before the battle of Nightmare Moon, and &#039;had the brilliant idea&#039; to take my forces through the mirror. We founded a cult in the early days of that version of earth--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, wait wait.&quot; Twilight held up a hoof. &quot;Was this the loop with the Komodo Dragon mounted wizards?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, it was a thousand year prank, some of the details were just crazy coincidences I incorporated on the fly!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry grinned. &quot;Ya&#039; know the 307 Ale? I once shoved the still halfway through the mirror.&quot; she smirked, pulling a bottle out of her pocket and holding it up proudly. &quot;An additional dimension was just what I needed to get past my little inventor&#039;s block. Introducing 460.5 Ale! Who&#039;s feeling brave?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No wait, I just thought of a better one! Tis&#039; a grand tale! Trixie had just discovered how to make thermite-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m feeling brave! In fact, a round for everybody!&quot; Gilda announced loudly and quickly.</p><p class="double">&quot;No fair! Why does nobody ever let Trixie tell that story!?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hello, Twilight.&quot; Fluttershy nodded to her friend for a moment, before turning back to her bird chorus. The avians seemed to be quite a bit larger, less colorful, and more... predatory than usual. &quot;I thought I&#039;d go with a different choir this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. &quot;That&#039;ll certainly be interesting, to say the least. Any reason why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I was an eagle last loop. Well, anthropomorphic.&quot; Fluttershy flexed her wings. &quot;Feathers on the back. I could fly on my own, but I also had a plane...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, I&#039;ll bite.&quot; Twilight pulled a PADD out of her pocket. &quot;Where was this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy flipped her mane back. &quot;Chima, I think it&#039;s only started looping? I had to give the Multiverse speech to Laval... Either he or Cragger are the anchor, not sure which one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her unicorn friend finished tapping on the screen and, after a moment, flinched back. &quot;Wait, you were a minifig?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A...&quot; Twilight turned the image around. &quot;This. Was this you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No! What?&quot; The pegasus peered at the image, shaking her head. &quot;No, no no, we looked a lot more--&quot; Fluttershy pulled out her own PADD, quickly flicking through some photos. &quot;Alright, here we go. That&#039;s me--apparently I was replacing someone called Eris--and that&#039;s Laval.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked from her picture to the one Fluttershy was showing. &quot;...huh. I... guess it must be a case of medium translation, or something... those do look far more realistic. Well, less plastic. Fingers and proportions and all that.&quot; She shrugged, putting the PADD back. &quot;That&#039;s... actually kind of fascinating...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Research later, Twilight.&quot; Fluttershy lightly bopped her with her own PADD. &quot;Right now we have to reintegrate Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, sorry, it&#039;s just... okay, so the plan is I pretend to be her pet dog...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">89.4 (cont)</p><p class="double">Fluttershy tilted her head. &quot;Actually, now that we&#039;re all here together, I&#039;ve been... meaning to discuss some things with you two.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Chrysalis glanced back at her &#039;sister&#039;. &quot;Does it have anything to do with ancient and powerful jewelry?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, yes.&quot; The wolf gave them an embarrassed little smile. &quot;I mean, I do have seniority in that particular aspect...&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon nodded, tapping her chin. &quot;Well, I suppose it&#039;s as good a time as any. Oh, before we begin though!&quot; She snapped her claws, summoning three buckets of bacon.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Thank you.&quot; Fluttershy grabbed a couple strips of meat and began to delicately chew one down.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hrm...&quot; Chrysalis bit one of her own strips in half. &quot;I would have thought you wouldn&#039;t like meat, Spoon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh. I&#039;ve been bounced around the animal kingdom so much I don&#039;t have many filters anymore.&quot; Silver Spoon sat down with a shrug. &quot;Remind me to tell you about the time I was a fly... still won&#039;t eat horses, though, if that counts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s understandable. Now then, Fluttershy, you were saying...?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. &quot;I... don&#039;t know if you&#039;ve noticed this, but those of us with the Element of Kindness... Well, even in loops where my special talent was something, um, unrelated to animals, like weather service or painting, I could still talk to my animal friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yeah, but... that could just be you retaining loop abilities.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It could, but... one loop, I discovered I could understand Elkish. That was a very Middle Earthish loop, mind you, the deer were basically elves, but I could understand this ancient language without, um, ever having seen a scrap of writing or hearing a single word spoken before.&quot; Fluttershy shifted on her paws. &quot;After that, I started paying attention, and, well... there is literally no language I cannot speak. Klingon, Quenya, Lapine, R&#039;yehain--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;R&#039;yehain?&quot; Silver tilted her head. &quot;Isn&#039;t that... Cthulhu&#039;s tongue?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. &quot;h&#039;R&#039;yehain goka k&#039;yarnak phlegethoth sll&#039;ha.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. &quot;I... I understood that. I mean, I understood what you meant and... and what you were actually saying.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. That&#039;s... I think that&#039;s the power that Kindness, the element, grants us. Understanding.&quot; Fluttershy nodded to Chrysalis. &quot;You, um, you probably never noticed because you thought it was just your telempathy, and you, Silver--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I passed it off as having &#039;been&#039; whatever they were before,&quot; Silver mused. &quot;I didn&#039;t realize...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, but it&#039;s more than that.&quot; Fluttershy nibbled at another strip of bacon, trying to gather her thoughts. &quot;...It&#039;s not just speaking, or writing. It&#039;s feeling. When you&#039;re using Kindness, you can read any body language, no matter how strange the body. Me, I&#039;m such a good druid because of it, and I suspect that Chrysalis tends to use it in her day to day rule. Silver, well...&quot; She smiled. &quot;Silver Spoon uses her understanding proactively, becoming whoever the situation needs her to be.&quot; She giggled. &quot;I think that&#039;s also why we&#039;re all so good at shapeshifting, or, well, being in other forms. I&#039;ve talked to some other shapeshifters and... a lot of them view the other shapes as clothes, not as themselves. If that makes sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. &quot;I think I see where you&#039;re coming from, actually. I was like that, originally, but... well, I do tend toward pegasus these days.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I think of myself as an earth pony draconequus plus,&quot; Silver added. &quot;Which... is more cohesive than I think I should be thinking of myself as.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. But there&#039;s a reason for all this.&quot; Fluttershy took a breath. &quot;Magic. Honesty. Loyalty. Even Laughter... they can be used in cruel ways. Generosity and Kindness, though, they&#039;re almost always &#039;good&#039; in a sense. I did talk with Rarity about it long ago, though, and... the basic difference between the two is that Generosity is, well, a bit... oblivious. Generosity only understands the What of the needs, not the Why. Kindness is... we&#039;re the ones that have to keep everyone from being overpowering, keep the others all in balance, I think. We&#039;re the ones that see all sides of the argument, good and evil, or even just good and good that happen to be opposed. We understand others, sometimes better than they understand themselves, and we have to use that understanding to make sure that <i>everyone</i> is loved.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis and Silver Spoon stared openly at her.</p><p class="double">&quot;...That&#039;s...&quot; Fluttershy blushed. &quot;That&#039;s my opinion anyway. Um. I&#039;m willing to hear yours though.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Like any looper that had some modicum of sense, Twilight Sparkle had created a number of contingency plans for surviving a zombie apocalypse.

There you are, here for lunch?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, um...&quot; Twilight fidgeted, still somewhat embarrassed by her trailing entrails. &quot;These are, you know, ethically sourced right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What kind of merchant do you take me for?! I&#039;m no butcher.&quot; Carrot scoffed. &quot;My cloning vats are completely regulation.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nonono, I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;m just...&quot; Twilight gave an awkward grin. &quot;Still a little squeamish. Only died this month, you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">Carrot made a noise of commiseration. &quot;Ah, gotcha. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m told it gets easier as you go. Rarity&#039;s certainly not let it stop her!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, selecting a few pinkish mounds. &quot;Yeah, I know...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I even heard she got herself some coltfriend or other. A dragon, isn&#039;t that exotic?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Yeah.</i> I <i>know.</i>&quot; Twilight repressed a shudder.</p><p class="double">The yellow mare grinned obliviously. &quot;It&#039;s good to know there are still people out there willing to look beyond the flesh and find true love in dead hearts. Makes me think maybe there&#039;s hope for me!&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn put her bits on the stall top. &quot;Heh, maybe. You&#039;re not planning to die just to grab a colt, though, are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha, no of course not! I&#039;d rather have a warm body!&quot; Carrot flinched. &quot;Er, no offense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;None taken.

They had been joined by two white unicorns she didn&#039;t recognize, clearly sisters; the older was on viola, and the younger had brought her own cello. Also, someone had somehow gotten a grand piano into the apartment, which Vinyl was playing. Softly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wh... what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl lifted her goggles and flashed a smile. &quot;Shh!&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia boggled as she listened. They were all utterly outstanding; the music was superb and utterly unfamiliar. She sidled down the stairs and sat on the bottom step.</p><p class="double">The door opened and a lavender unicorn slipped in, followed by a yellow pegasus with a pink mane, and an orange pegasus filly with a purple mane, carrying a clarinet, a bassoon, and a flute, respectively.</p><p class="double">When the music came to a close, Vinyl got up and turned to the new guests. &quot;Heya! Glad you could make it! Octavia, these are Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy, and Scootaloo. And now that they&#039;re here, how about we really get this show going?&quot;</p><p class="double">She produced a part out of nowhere and handed it to Octavia. &quot;Want to join?&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia blinked, then snatched it in her mouth. &quot;Yes!&quot; she declared around her grip. <i>When did she pick up an interest in music that wasn&#039;t simply rhythmic and loud? Have I not been paying attention?</i></p><p class="double">The title made her blink:</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Bach, Johann Sebastian</p><p class="double">Chamber suite R17-L-34, in a minor</p><p class="double">On themes by Hotblack Desiato and Taliesin</p><p class="double">SB-BWV 2,126,329,801</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">But that didn&#039;t matter compared to what was below it. They started up and Octavia sight-read like mad. The piece was intricate, but she was <i>just</i> able to keep up. What didn&#039;t help was that there were little distractions and unexpected things - <i>Did somepony else just come in?</i> This was confirmed when a third violin joined the ensemble. During a single whole rest, she spotted the newcomer. <i>I&#039;ve seen him before - he&#039;s the head of the royal guard!</i></p><p class="double">Then it came to the double fugue, and she didn&#039;t have time to focus on anything else any more. She knew that more ponies were coming in and joining, and she knew that this had to have been a setup - a surprise for her - but she was having too much fun to let it bother her.</p><p class="double">It came to a satisfying conclusion, and Octavia let the energy flow out of her.</p><p class="double">Vinyl added, &quot;What do you think? Our dad threw it together a while back.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her mind still absorbed in the music, Octavia &#039;s response was not perhaps what she would have said under other circumstances, &quot;&#039;Our&#039;? Aren&#039;t you an only foal?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, it&#039;s a family gathering.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>That seems... implausible.</i> Octavia took a look around. She was drained enough that her discovery that Princess Celestia was seated behind her, with the second viola, was merely surprising, not shocking.</p><p class="double">Vinyl went on, &quot;Almost all of us Bach kids are here. We&#039;re only missing Regina Suzanna - who&#039;s busy straightening out the hive - and Pretty Danged Quick, who, ah...&quot; she lowered her voice. &quot;... doesn&#039;t quite get it.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p>From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">Well, this is an interesting situation. This Loop, I&#039;m a boxer in the World Video Boxing Association, with my coach being Little Mac.</p><p class="double">Mac had Awoken recently, and had soon ended up in a Fused Loop with Mario as the referee. Mac soon found himself in the Smash Brothers Loops, which are a safe-mode Loop due to the limits it puts on Loopers for fair competition.</p><p class="double">Back to the events of this Loop...I had to learn not to always rely on the combat instincts I&#039;ve developed, or get disqualified. It was a chance to hone a particular fighting style....Boxing, in this case.</p><p class="double">Mac is a good teacher, having learned from the best. He was a little out of shape this Loop; makes sense, seeing he&#039;s in his teacher&#039;s role. I soon managed to get used to boxing, and my career began. After a good warm-up in Glass Joe(with a name like that, no wonder he&#039;s gotten his flank kicked 99 times..before I fought him, of course), I had a minor challenge in Von Kaiser, and won via a Star Punch. Mac smiled when I used his signature move. </p><p class="double">After that, I began to shine, remembering what Mac taught me; how to see an opponent&#039;s patterns, wait for the opening, and capitalize. Ranma taught me that a long time ago, but it&#039;s good to have a refresher course, especially when my options are limited.</p><p class="double">As I went through the ranks, Mac was glad to see I&#039;d gotten used to the relative oddness of the boxers here. He said he&#039;d had a hard time adjusting to their weirdness at first. Compared to other Loops, the weirdness of these guys is nothing. After all, after what I&#039;ve seen, guys like Bear Hugger and King Hippo barely register on the weird scale. Looks were deceiving, though. Some of those guys were tough. </p><p class="double">As for what I took from this Loop, I was reminded that I can&#039;t always rely on my full bag of tricks. Boxing is a good style for me to use in those cases. As for Little Mac, I hope to meet him in a Smash Brothers Loop, just so I can see how good he is... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.14(Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Celestia gave her Summer Sun Celebration speech, her eyes scanned the crowd. Twilight Sparkle was nowhere to be seen. Furthermore, the Mare on the Moon had disappeared yesterday for some strange reason, well before the stars were set to align and help her break free. As her speech came to an end, several birds landed on the stage set up for the celebration. The gathered ponies stopped stomping their hooves in applause and watched.</p><p class="double">One bird started with a nine note ominous whistle. A second bird followed up with an equally ominous tone.</p><p class="double">Then, the entire bird choir sang in unison the Imperial March. Six ponies marched in unison towards the stage, all sporting a uniform of sorts made of purple, black and yellow. All six wore masks and a purple fedora to hide their manes. There were two of each pony race. As they took positions around the stage behind Celestia, the gathered ponies started appearing nervous as navy blue mist seeped through the crowd and between Celestia and the six ponies. As the music reached the height, the mist started swirling around and formed into a new alicorn. Celestia gasped, &quot;Nightmare Moon, what is-&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn waved Celestia silent, &quot;My ponies, I am Princess Luna, Night regent of the moon. My time on the moon has ended and I return to you now. I have but one thing to say...&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd held their breaths as one as Luna pointed her hoof at the audience, a serious expression on her face, &quot;Princess Luna Wants YOU, for the shadowbolts!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked, &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna gave a grin, &quot;I desire to reform my guard, and I desire the bravest and the best to join our cause. Join your fellow ponies up here, join us as we push for a more grand Equestrian future! We will fly through the shadows, pushing back the darkness that always encroaches on the universe, yes I say the universe! We will reach out to the stars and bring harmony to the furthest corner of the galaxy. Who will stand with me?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Several ponies took hesitant steps forward, a turquoise mare with a harp for a cutie mark, muttering about how she might see humans out there. A barely sober mare with a berry colored mare obsessed with alcohol stumbled forward, three unmarked fillies and a pink earth pony stepped forward, the zebra from Everfree found herself on the stage, and then the local mailmare.</p><p class="double">Celestia was finally brought out of her trance as she stepped towards Luna, and the two teleported away to discuss what was the meaning of this.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hours later, the six shadowbolts shed their disguise in the privacy of the library, revealing Twilight and her five friends. Fluttershy left to congratulate her birds for their fine performance. Rarity, meanwhile looked to the skies, &quot;You don&#039;t think we jinxed ourselves, do you? I mean-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight waved her off, &quot;Nah, I checked our star charts. None of them were a match for the Star Wars or Star Trek star charts.&quot;</p><p class="double">And then, what sounded like the tormented of Tartarus started echoing in their heads as a black and red ship descended over Ponyville. The voices disappeared a second later as they all instinctively blocked out the passive indoctrination attack. Dash asked with a half-lidded expression, &quot;Did you perhaps check the star charts against those of Mass Effect?&quot;</p><p class="double">Any reply that Twilight had was cut off by a mechanical voice, <b>&quot;I AM SOVEREIGN. TWILIGHT SPARKLE, YOU WILL TRAVEL BY SHIP TO MEET ME ON THE MOON IN ONE GALACTIC HOUR&#039;S TIME. FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN FORCIBLE TELEPORTATION INTO THIS SHIP.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">Pinkie seemed ecstatic, &quot;Sovvy! I haven&#039;t seen him in eons, from before the crash. Silly robot, I still haven&#039;t given him all his birthday parties, I&#039;m coming with you, Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, &quot;Sure.

Now,&quot; the unfamiliar voice demanded.</p><p class="double">Ryu turned with graceful practice towards the voice to get a look and determine what kind of drink would serve the customer best and blinked. There was no one there. Getting a sinking feeling, Ryu leaned over the bar and looked down at a young boy in possession of a fierce scowl. Sighing heavily, he shook his head and pointed to a new sign he&#039;d gotten recently for just this kind of problem.</p><p class="double">Around a large &#039;21&#039;, the sign read &#039;You must be <i>this</i> tall (or equivalent biological age) to order booze.&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bar policy,&quot; he explained when the scowl deepened. &quot;No matter how long you&#039;ve lived, you gotta have a body that can process it safely. It also helps if you introduce yourself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well,&quot; the boy grumbled and cast some sort of spell that caused him to grow, and grow, into a tall muscled man with wild hair and a fierce expression. &quot;Leman Russ, Primarch of the Space Wolves. Now give me a damn drink.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Ryu replied, completely unruffled as he began to expertly mix a creation of his own devising. &quot;Might I inquire as to why you are in need of one?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s just say that there are certain things one should never catch his mother doing,&quot; the Primarch muttered as Ryu handed him his drink, which he downed in a single gulp and motioned for another.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hear that,&quot; a new voice interjected, grabbing both men&#039;s attention. They turned and saw an ebony skinned woman with bold indigo hair in the final moments of filling out into adulthood. She tapped her chin for a moment before also sprouting wings and a single spiral horn as black as deepest night. &quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not at all,&quot; Leman Russ smiled as Ryu poured two drinks and went back to cleaning glasses. &quot;Might I have your name m&#039;lady?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nyx,&quot; the woman smiled. &quot;Daughter of Twilight Sparkle. And you must be the amazing Lemon Rush I keep hearing about. I&#039;m kind of surprised we haven&#039;t met before actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As am I,&quot; Leman admitted as he sipped his new drink more sedately than his first. &quot;I have heard much about you, but I would be honored to get it &#039;from the pony&#039;s mouth&#039; so to speak.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cute,&quot; Nyx glared back playfully as Leman grinned with no apology whatsoever. &quot;Anyway, it all started when this cult...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">110.16 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Thirty seconds to drop zone, Rainbow Dash.&quot;</p><p class="double">On the one hand, Rainbow Dash counted the current Loop as one of the weirder ones she&#039;d experienced- not in the top hundred, but definitely in the top thousand. For one thing, she herself was a shadow of the pony she was... or, more accurately, a glowing outline. Oh, she was solid enough, but anybody looking at her saw only the outline of her blue body and rainbow mane and tail, all lit up like a deco electric sign. That could be put down to strange physics or something, but Twilight Sparkle looked more or less normal.</p><p class="double">But the face in the mirror was a minor issue. The rest of the world was Land-of-Ooo levels of strange.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m charging up the marshmallow laser now!&quot;</p><p class="double">Case in point. In what other world would a marshmallow laser be a suitable weapon for covering fire?</p><p class="double">And to make it perfect, this was one of those annoying Loops where both subspace pockets and outside-Loop abilities were totally shut down. Rainbow Dash had spent two humiliating months Awake before Twilight had found her, practically a slave in the Silver Lake Lounge, constantly humiliated by the Gummi King&#039;s marzipan enforcers, and freed her. Twilight had freed her, and the two had fled, pursued by bounty hunters like the Rockabilly Space Worm and a space salamander who had been genetically altered to have a face that resembled, for whatever reason, George Clooney.</p><p class="double">If Pinkie Pie had told this story to her, Rainbow Dash would have laughed it off as too silly for words. Unfortunately she&#039;d lived it, twenty or so years&#039; worth of Loop memories pre-Awakening followed by months of pursuit by bounty hunters like the Rockabilly Space Worm and a space salamander who had been genetically altered to have a face that resembled, for whatever reason, George Clooney. in which two fugitives from justice had become the heroes of the resistance against (even after a year in this world Rainbow Dash hated to think the words) the Gluten Armada of the tyrannical Gummi King.</p><p class="double">No, it wasn&#039;t funny at all. It was dead serious.</p><p class="double">The bomb bay doors opened with a whine of hydraulics. Over the whoosh of rushing air Dash could just barely hear Twilight giving the five second warning. That was her job: deliver Rainbow around the world, wherever they could strike at the Armada. Once Rainbow was in battle, Twilight would keep her covered with the marshmallow laser mounted to their transport. Twilight had become a crack shot with the thing.</p><p class="double">The <u>Space Unicorn</u> and the <u>Neon Pegasus</u>; the most-wanted enemies of the Gummi King.</p><p class="double">The jump light turned green. Rainbow Dash pushed her flight goggles down over her eyes and dropped out of the transport ship, banking away so she could have a clear field of battle.</p><p class="double">Beneath them sat Cupcake Mountain, lit mostly by the bright moon and brilliant stars. In front of them, hovering above the mountain, stood the main battle fleet of the Gluten Armada. At the center of it flew the imperial flagship, where the Gummi King himself would command the battle to come.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash put aside all thoughts of how insane and ridiculous the situation was. Somewhere over there was an evil ruler who had kept her pre-Awake self in chains, who had forced her to kneel and scrape and abase herself to survive. He had taken everything from her, and from millions of other beings throughout his magical kingdom.</p><p class="double"><i>Never again,</i> Dash vowed. <i>Never again, never again.</i></p><p class="double">One pony against a fleet of battleships, she dove to the attack in a streak of rainbow light. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p>I Looped into a place called Earthrealm this time...right around the Mortal Kombat tournament.

Raiden(no relation to the Metal Gear Looper with the same name) is the Anchor here.</p><p class="double">Apparently, things had gone really bad in the baseline, as in Armageddon bad, and he tried sending a message to his past self to avert that tragedy. However, he got only a partial message, and things got worse than that first time for a while; though he prevented the worst-case scenario, it was at great cost.</p><p class="double">Raiden believed what he&#039;d done to send that message was causing him to reexperience the same events, but Kratos had Looped in and explained things to him, and as a treat, took down the big villain around here, Shao Khan.</p><p class="double">The joke&#039;s too easy, so I won&#039;t use it...</p><p class="double">These days, Raiden is trying to minimize the damage and loss of life....which, in a place where fights to the death are commonplace(though it seems this Loop got the same &#039;get out of death free&#039; card the DC and Marvel Loops have), is very difficult. A few others on Raiden&#039;s side have started Looping as well, such as Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, and Sonya. These days, Cage and Sonya are in a relationship, which is kinda heartwarming.</p><p class="double">As for the Anchor himself, he&#039;s still bound to the rules his superiors set on him..though his fellow Loopers AREN&#039;T. Cue them taking down the baddies easily, and ruining any evil plans. While I was here, I took the time to learn from the good guys. This place is, as I said before, violent. It&#039;s like a battlefield here, lives on the line in every fight....With no less than Earthrealm&#039;s freedom on the line. Makes me hope things&#039;ll turn out all right here once the Loops are over. </p><p class="double">As a gift to Raiden, I decided to eventually pull no punches, and take down Shao Khan. Was NOT an easy fight...guy can take damage and deal it like nobody&#039;s business. But I got the better of him in the end.

Applejack wasn&#039;t sure how this stranger had gotten a permit for her stall, but there it was: a simple wooden desk, with a sign beside it, sitting off to the side of the market.</p><p class="double"><i>Time&#039;s Broken, Ask Me Anything.</i> The Timetraveller is: <u>In</u></p><p class="double">The purple unicorn behind the desk was answering a question about how the Celebration would go. She told a tall tale, about how Princess Celestia&#039;s long lost sister, possessed by evil magic, was going to kidnap the Princess, and plunge the world into eternal night.</p><p class="double">&quot;...And at the end of their adventure, these six plucky young mares will defeat Nightmare Moon, with the help of some ancient magical artifacts. Freshly purged of her dark self, Princess Luna will return to Ponyville with her sister, and they join in the party.&quot; She finished with a smile. &quot;Next question?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s own sister was the one that answered, shouting across the market to her. &quot;How much timber would a Timberwolf wolf, if a Timberwolf could wolf timber?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now that, is an interesting question. You see, a Timberwolf can only eat so much wood before...&quot; And she was off again. If nothing else, she was livening up the day. Most the town had the day off, to finish preparations for tomorrow&#039;s Celebration, so the market was a bit empty this morning. Applejack herself would be packing up her stall come late morning, for her family&#039;s reunion, as well as their part in the preparations.</p><p class="double">After she made sure her family&#039;s anti-Timberwolf preparations were up to snuff. &quot;...So by the time the Timberwolf has spawned a second offshoot, the first offshoot would be forty percent towards its own offshoot, bringing the combined Timberwolf pack&#039;s ability to wolf timber to...&quot;</p><p class="double">In fact, she might need to restock a few things. Maybe everypony she knows will be getting Timberwolf survival kits for Hearth&#039;s Warming. &quot;...And at that point, the exponentially expanding pack will have moved beyond the forest, or rather, the former forest, and likely devour the town in less than an hour.&quot;</p><p class="double">Magicking away the blackboard she had been using in her lecture, the unicorn turned back to her slightly fearful audience. &quot;So, in the end, we&#039;re all very lucky that Timberwolves don&#039;t wolf as much timber as they can.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It all happened, just like she said it would.

You know I&#039;ve been here all day, and would have been back tomorrow.&quot; Tilting her head to the side, Twilight thought for a second. &quot;In fact, weren&#039;t you in the market this afternoon?

How... convenient.&quot; Twilight pulled a jug and cup from where they were hidden, under the desk, and poured Lyra some water.</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, figures the know-it-all time traveller would see through that.&quot; Lyra gulped down her drink. &quot;Anyway, my question.

This morning, I received six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala. However--&quot;</p><p class="double"><i><b>&quot;THE GRAND GALLOPING GALA?&quot;</b></i> The crowd erupted into noise, drowning out Twilight&#039;s words and rendering it impossible to catch more than snatches of what any one pony was saying.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve always wanted to go to the Gala, ever since that one time at band camp--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;--and I&#039;ll squeeze them and snuggle them--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;--then before she greets me back I&#039;ll walk away and she&#039;ll be so confused--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;--gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms, just watching the hours tick by--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;--and then the world will finally know the truth about Ch--&quot;</p><p class="double">A large explosion went off directly above the stall, shocking everypony in the crowd into silence, save one. &quot;...and then I said, &#039;But why <i>wouldn&#039;t</i> I join a blurt-out-your-least-realistic-dreams-of-what-would-happen-if-you-got-invited-to-Equestria&#039;s-biggest-party-party?&#039; Oh, sorry Twilight! Go ahead!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Thank you, Pinkie. As I was saying: The Grand Galloping Gala, at least this year&#039;s one, hardly <i>ever</i> goes well. Thus far, nopony from Ponyville has managed to go there without the reason they wanted to attend backfiring horribly on them <i>unless</i> they knew beforehoof what they were getting into or didn&#039;t have any expectations about it to begin with. The average Gala ends with at least one extremely dramatic breakup, statuary collapsing, a menagerie stampeding through the dining hall whilst the band plays unfitting music, all the festivities dead and cake, <i>everywhere</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd looked uneasy at this. Twilight brushed some soot off her stall and continued. &quot;Now, I&#039;m expected to attend this Gala <i>almost</i> every time it happens, which means I know more about what to expect and how to enjoy it than anypony except Princess Celestia...and in all likelihood I am going to be stuck sitting in the entrance hall greeting guests all night, <i>but</i> I&#039;ll also get to spend time with at least one friend from Canterlot in the process, and I usually get to hang out with more once all the guests have finally arrived. Plus, if we&#039;re lucky, we can get a smaller, more private get-together going later on which <i>always</i> results in a much better night for everyone involved.&quot; She absently blew out a small flame in her mane. &quot;So, anypony who wants to go should bear in mind that while it&#039;s not all it&#039;s cracked up to be, you can still have a good time at the Gala, especially if a friend is going with you. The tickets will go to whoever I think is most likely to enjoy the experience, and I won&#039;t be giving out <i>any</i> of the tickets for <i>at least</i> a week, so make sure you&#039;ve thought long and hard about just why you want to go before you apply to get one.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">Twilight had closed her booth for the day and retreated into the relative privacy of the Library&#039;s main room.</p><p class="double">An eerily familiar magical disturbance began to form near the base of the stairs to her loft. Loose papers and other objects began to flutter about, then the magenta-bordered white orb formed before emitting a blinding flash.</p><p class="double">Another Twilight Sparkle had joined her in the room.</p><p class="double">Disheveled mane, check. Eyepatch, check. Bandage on head, check. Scar on cheek, check. Tattered black body suit, check.</p><p class="double">The battered and singed Time Traveler booth was an interesting touch, along with the &quot;The Timetraveler is: <u>Not Kidding</u>&quot; sign.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no,&quot; groaned the un-displaced unicorn. &quot;What could possibly have made you think using that spell was a good idea?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Six words,&quot; her counterpart replied. &quot;Cutie Mark Crusader Underworld Beast Trainers.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a brief pause as one Twilight let the other think through the implications.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cerberus?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cerberus.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What about Fluttershy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We told her about Tornado Day.

The peppermint pylon activated with an electric humming noise.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha! Try and get us now, you stupid non-corporeal bag of wind!&quot; the purple-haired girl shook her fist at the sky, &quot;I triple pony dare you, you leftover remnant of an awkward burp!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, Scoots?&quot; Apple Bloom cautiously approached her friend, &quot;Are you sure it&#039;s a good idea to taunt, er.. the death?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t understand. I&#039;ve been preparing for another stupid Final Destination loop ever since that thing happened to me in the last one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;With the oak tree and the helicopter and the bowl of yogurt?&quot; Sweetie Belle piped in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. That,&quot; Scootaloo deadpanned, &quot;Well, I got one of Pinkie&#039;s video game pylons active. So even if it gets me, I&#039;ll just happily respawn as long as the pylon remains on.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a slow whining noise, the peppermint pylon turned itself off for no reason.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was suddenly next to the powered-down device, frantically trying to turn it on. It was a rather difficult task as the only interface consisted of a large red candy-like button - which was quickly being pressed over and over.</p><p class="double">Another electric humming noise caused the sport-oriented member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to whip her head to the side. There, she saw Sweetie Belle with another working peppermint pylon.</p><p class="double">&quot;Apparently, we had the same idea,&quot; Sweetie Belle smiled, &quot;Great minds think alike, I suppose.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er sorry to interrupt, girls, but did Pinkie ever say what would happen if two of those pylons were activated next to one another, or in a place where luck and chance are at the whim of malicious entities?&quot; Apple Bloom questioned while pointing to the pylons. Scootaloo&#039;s pylon was now working again. That would have been fantastic except that wild bolts of eldritch magical energy were now playing across both candy looking artifacts, zapping between hers and Sweetie Belle&#039;s devices like a demented Jacob&#039;s ladder.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahh! Do something, Apple Bloom!&quot; Sweetie Belle cried out to her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;d like to. There&#039;s just three little problems. One, these things are magical artifacts; which I&#039;ve never studied too much. Two, they are made of enchanted candy; which I have never worked with. And thirdly, they were crafted by Pinkie Pie... who is Pinkie Pie, and everything that entails. I believe that the challenges posed by these little old facts are all self evident,&quot; Apple Bloom watched cautiously as the pylon&#039;s noise reached a crescendo. She just hoped they all wouldn&#039;t end up in Eiken again.</p><p class="double">Then suddenly and without warning, the two pylons flashed like strobe lights and plummeted downwards through the concrete and beyond.</p><p class="double">The three girls looked down at the holes.</p><p class="double">&quot;How deep do you think...?&quot; Sweetie Belle started to ask.</p><p class="double">&quot;Deep. Very, very deep,&quot; Apple Bloom answered after looking down one of the holes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you think that anyone would notice?&quot; Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, they are pretty deep in there,&quot; the youngest Apple family member thought for a moment, &quot;Unless Pinkie only made them operate at a tiny fraction of their full potential power, I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll need to worry about them doing anything to the surroundings anytime soon.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next day, Apple Bloom slammed the daily newspaper down on the table. She stared at her friends before asking, &quot;Did Pinkie, perchance, mention anything about how those peppermint pylons are powered?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Sweetie Belle spoke up, &quot;I did ask her, but you know how Pinkie can get. She went on a rambling tangent of an explanation. I think she mentioned something about transfiguration spells and sugar and anti-sugar or something like that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom stared at her friend and sighed, &quot;Fantastic. They&#039;re powered by a near endless supply of antimatter. That, along with that harmonic resonance or whatever happened yesterday would probably explain today&#039;s newspaper.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle craned their necks to look at the print.</p><p class="double">There on the front page, in a truly gigantic font, was the headline: &#039;DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY!&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apparently, all sapient deaths not caused by natural causes results in a respawn,&quot; Apple Bloom summarized, &quot;Everywhere. Across the entire planet. What are we going to do about this, girls?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have an idea,&quot; Scootaloo said with a nod.</p><p class="double">Then she stood up and seamlessly continued her previous day&#039;s rant against death. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">111.3 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack, presently wandering through ancient China, stopped at the top of a pass and surveyed the next valley. She raised a hand to block out the evening sun. <i>Looks kind of swampy. Oh well, a little mud in my sandals won&#039;t stop me.</i></p><p class="double">She was only a little way down when a bit of sudden movement caught her eye - someone had fallen into one of the pools. Another moment&#039;s watching, and Applejack realized that the person&#039;s response to this situation was panic instead of simply getting out of the water. Applejack took one step of a running start before realizing that she was far too slow in this form. A burst of magic, and she had transformed full Alicorn. She leapt into the air and sped towards the pool.</p><p class="double">Before she was a quarter of the way there, she had levitated a girl out and to safety.</p><p class="double">When Applejack landed next to her, the girl bowed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww, git up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Most illustrious being...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not hearing it. Git up. Where I&#039;m from, I&#039;m a farmer.&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl did look up briefly, and continued, &quot;O magical farmer who saved my life...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, you&#039;re welcome.&quot;</p><p class="double">She finally raised her head and left it up. &quot;Why did you come down and save me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cause I was walking down the path on my way to nowhere in particular, and just saw you drownin&#039; there? It&#039;s not that complicated.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;May I travel with you?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Hmm. Do I need to deal with a worshipper?</i> &quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl did not insist. Applejack nodded and continued on. On the far end of the valley, Applejack settled down to camp.</p><p class="double">And in the morning, looking back from the other side, she immediately recognized it: Jusenkyo. <i>Ah, not a generic ancient China loop. Pre-Ranma. That explains why I didn&#039;t get any other pings - he&#039;ll wake up in a few centuries. Aaaand I just rescued the girl the cursed spring imprinted on. Hmm.

The Single File Line is a perfectly valid formation, Sergeant Red, sir!&quot; She snapped to attention, her left eye leaving the butterfly it had been tracking. The sergeant caught that wayward eye, however.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then why are you watching the local creepy crawlies?&quot; Red stopped at a crossroads in the path, and turned to face Pvt. Doo. &quot;You are a Private in Her Majesty&#039;s Royal Guard, you need to be attentive-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you hear that?&quot; Pvt. Doo interrupted him. &quot;It sounds like screaming.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gall darn it, Private, you interrupted me again! How many times do I have to tell you not to interrupt me!&quot; Seeing Ditzy snap to attention, Red continued. &quot;As I was saying, you need to be alert! Observant! Attentive! Ready to act on a moment&#039;s notice! And under no circumstances should you <i>ever</i>-&quot;</p><p class="double">While he had been speaking, the screaming Ditzy Doo heard had been getting closer. Even still, it was a surprise when, amidst the sound of a screaming mare and squeaking wheels, Sergeant Red vanished from in front of her in a clattering bang and a blur of brown.</p><p class="double">With the sergeant&#039;s spear clattering to the ground, Ditzy let out an uneasy call. &quot;Mister Sergeant? Are- Are you still there? Sarge?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile, the sergeant, along with two fillies and a teenage mare, were rapidly leaving Pvt. Doo in the dust. As he admired the tall wheelbase, which allowed him to cling to the front of the go kart without dragging on the pavement, Sergeant Red took stock of the ponies involved in this incident.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry Mister Guard! I didn&#039;t mean to hit you, but the brakes aren&#039;t working!&quot; Currently at the wheel, and trying to see around his head, was Equestria&#039;s Darling Filly, Princess Twilight Sparkle. Currently at the age of twelve, her special talents were Magic, and being the Cutest Princess.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, we&#039;re tall enough, that if you let go, you&#039;d probably be fine!&quot; Ah yes, Smarty Pants. Alleged age of ten, ward of the royal family, special talents include a perfect memory, and being smarter than you.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wanna get off! I changed my mind! Make it stop!&quot; And finally, cowering in the back of the go kart, was Princess Mi Amore &#039;Cadance&#039; Cadenza. The sixteen year old alicorn was the envy of all teenage fillies, and the reason the color pink and stable relationships were in style.</p><p class="double">And finally there was him, Staff Sergeant Rhode Island Red, forty year veteran of Her Majesty&#039;s Royal Guard, and entirely too old for this crap. In three days, he was going to retire, and go raise chickens. Far, far away from things like this.</p><p class="double">Ultimately though, the decision of how to handle this situation was taken out of his hooves, when Smarty Pants pointed somewhere behind him and shouted. &quot;Ramp!&quot;</p><p class="double">As his eyes widened in fear, Sergeant Red decided to take his chances with the pavement, and let go of the kart.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia had grown used to Twilight and Smarty getting into things, over the past year. The energetic filly often dragged Twilight out to play, sometimes literally pulling her from her books. Personally she felt it was good for Twilight, having such a close friend so early in her life. Celestia just wished that she didn&#039;t have to clean up after them so often.</p><p class="double">Case in point, the two soaking wet fillies, a shivering Cadance, whose coltfriend was trying to talk her out of the deathgrip she had on a nearby tree, and the go kart slowly sinking in the pond.</p><p class="double">She pointedly did not look back at the trail they had left behind them, leading across half the noble district, all the way up to where it had begun in the palace gardens. The two fillies were the reason most the nobles had summer homes now; they didn&#039;t want to be around when they weren&#039;t distracted by school work.</p><p class="double">Sighing the forlorn sigh of a single parent, Celestia turned to the most likely culprit. &quot;Dare I ask what you were doing this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Smarty replied, &quot;I can tell you what we <i>weren&#039;t</i> doing, and that was reenacting this awesome scene from Barons of Disaster! There&#039;s this scene, ya see, and they...&quot; As Smarty described the epic chase scene they had been trying to play out, Twilight was shaking the water out of her helmet.</p><p class="double">By the time Cadance was finally coaxed off the tree, Smarty had gotten to the part of her tale where their plan went wrong. &quot;So I figure that the guard we ran over meant we bled off more speed than we&#039;d planned on in the flat part, and that meant we didn&#039;t have enough speed to clear the pond, even though we did the barrel roll perfectly. Cady did great with that!&quot; Smarty beamed at her cousin.</p><p class="double">Turning her attention to her niece, Celestia raised an eyebrow. &quot;And how did they talk you into this? While I let you indulge Smarty&#039;s love of action movies, I mainly do it because I know you&#039;ll rein them in. So why this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Blushing, Cadance rubbed her foreleg with her hoof. &quot;If I helped them, they promised to be nice to Shiny for a month.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the two fillies tried their best to look like they weren&#039;t sticking their tongues out at Shining Armor while everypony&#039;s backs were turned, Celestia simply decided she&#039;d heard enough. Walking to the water, she set about fishing out her daughters&#039; kart, speaking as she did so. &quot;You two get no dessert tonight, and I&#039;ll let you have the kart back next week.&quot; Sounds of dismay came from the fillies. &quot;Cadance also gets no dessert tonight, for helping you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And as for you, young stallion,&quot; Celestia turned to look Shining Armor in the eyes. &quot;I fully expect to see you for dinner next friday.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">111.5&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dalxein)</p><p class="double">Twilight looked out over the town of Ponyville and sighed.</p><p class="double">Everything had been covered in a thin layer of highly magic, heat, and impact resistant... rubberized gel? It seemed to heed known fluid dynamics models about as well as Pinkie did the laws of motion. Her only explanation for what had transpired came when the Crusaders sullenly trudged their way toward her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright.&quot; She half-huffed. It was mostly another sigh. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Apple Bloom started, hesitant.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo stepped forward. &quot;We were trying to figure out how to bake Gummi Blocks to make a Gummi Ship. You know, like Sora&#039;s?&quot; At the anchor&#039;s nod, she continued. &quot;But then the containment vat for the unfinished solution failed, and... Yeah, we&#039;re really sorry, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;On the plus side...&quot; Sweetie Belle cut in, &quot;I think it&#039;ll start to dissolve if we can find the right harmonic frequency! Or at least get it to stop being so hard to pry up...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded and started her rummage for sonic amplifiers in her pocket, offhandedly commenting- &quot;At least this doesn&#039;t have anything to do with tree sap.&quot;</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t see them wince. &quot;Well if you want to get <i>technical</i>...&quot; Bloom didn&#039;t finish, as Twilight was already conking her head against a rather large amplifier. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">111.6 <b>(TokoWH)</b></p><p class="double">(Part 1 of ?)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ember awoke with a blink. Immediately, she knew something was off. She was still in her dragon body, that much she could assure herself on, at least. However, for once she hadn&#039;t awoken in her room. Scanning her surroundings, wherever she was, she concluded that it definitely wasn&#039;t the Dragon Realms.</p><p class="double">Though the town she was in still had the bright and cheery charm of the realms, the houses around her were made of wood instead of Artisan-grade marble. Off in the distance, she could see rolling green fields not unlike the Artisans, but something about the nearby forest unnerved her greatly. The striking detail, however, was the population of miniature horses of all different colors of the rainbow.</p><p class="double">Despite the rather saccharine look of this place, Ember gulped as she shuddered slightly. She&#039;d known this would eventually happen, and was grateful that it was some place that didn&#039;t look too dangerous, but this was the first loop that she wasn&#039;t with her family.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Okay, Ember. Calm down. Remember what the </i>other <i>Spyro taught you,&#039; </i>she thought, trying her best to come off as unassuming to the beings around her. <i>&#039;Check your &#039;in-loop memories&#039; before anything else.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Proceeding to do so, she frowned slightly and wished she hadn&#039;t. From what they told her, she was a dragon that had come to live with the ponies in Ponyville because she just didn&#039;t fit in with her society. The dragons of this realm were a rather rowdy bunch. Her early life wasn&#039;t one of pleasure, having been teased and poked by the others because of her gentle nature. Her scales being bright pink hadn&#039;t helped matters much, either.</p><p class="double">If nothing else, she could at least take solace in that her in loop parents had more or less been the same as her usual ones in that they had tried to protect and comfort her as much as they could. But, regardless, the damage had made its mark and Ember had become known as &#039;the wimpy pony lover&#039; to her own kind the day she finally couldn&#039;t take it anymore and moved to a much nicer crowd.</p><p class="double">She shook her head, pushing those memories as far back as she could before they could leave permanent trauma. Focusing on more recent events, she let out a sigh of relief. Though the crowd she was in was a bit wary of having a dragon among them—she could still feel a few of them giving her uneasy looks—they were much more accepting of her than her own kind. The fact that her early loop trauma had left her rather timid had helped. She sighed. At least that meant this loop wouldn&#039;t be nothing but torture.</p><p class="double">However, the thing that unnerved her the most was that she had no in-loop memories of Spyro, nor of Sparx, Hunter, the other Spyro and his Sparx, or Cynder. From this, she could assume that none of them were here in this loop. Which meant, for the first time in her looping life, she was completely on her own.</p><p class="double">Once again, despite her saccharine surroundings, she hunkered down and shivered, her blue eyes darting from left to right.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Alright, Ember. Just stay calm. At least you&#039;re in a peaceful place. Best thing you can do is just go along with what your pre-awake self did and ride the loop out.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">With that thought in mind, she continued what her pre-awake self had been doing and continued her grocery shopping.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ember walked along the path in an almost trance-like state, her mind focusing on more recent in-loop memories. Apparently, when it came to carrying over from her normal loops, she still liked to volunteer in childcare. Since there was no apparent daycare, though, this meant she spent most of her time helping out at the local schoolhouse. Understandably, considering the dragons of this world, most of the parents were rather apprehensive about a dragon being around their young. But the school teacher, Cheerilee, didn&#039;t seem to mind too much.</p><p class="double">Her in-loop memories told her that Cheerilee was responsible for most of the town warming up to the pink dragoness, having seen the gentle nature in her that most wouldn&#039;t catch at a glance. Of course, her helping her out in teaching draconian history, a rare history not many ponies knew much about, probably helped, but that was a minor detail.</p><p class="double">Currently, her in-loop memories told her that tonight was the Summer Sun Celebration, and as a result, school was closed for the holiday. Her in-loop self had planned to spend the day just keeping to herself. She wasn&#039;t even planning to attend the celebration. Ember frowned. She couldn&#039;t believe how reclusive her in-loop self was, but at the same time she couldn&#039;t exactly blame her, either. At the very least, she could try to be a bit sociable now that she was awake. How to go about it, though, considering her species didn&#039;t exactly have the cleanest track record, was going to be a thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;All I&#039;m saying, Twi, is that having accessories is one thing. Walking around looking like you lost a fight with a jewellery store clerk is something completely different!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember blinked before turning around. She was instantly met with quite possibly the oddest sight she had seen from this loop so far. Walking along the path was a lavender unicorn. Given what she had seen so far, that wouldn&#039;t be any different from the norm, but the fact that said unicorn was dressed up from head to heels with golden chains, a pair of over-sized shades, golden braces on her teeth, and an oversized cloak hanging around her neck was more than enough to raise some heads. Ember had no idea how the huge cloak didn&#039;t snap the unicorn&#039;s neck.</p><p class="double">The unicorn looked down at the young purple dragon next to her with a grin, possibly blinding a few beings with those impossibly shiny braces.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah am tellin&#039; ya, Shpike! Theesh whill be tha new styl of tha futura.&quot;</p><p class="double">The young dragon blinked before shaking his head. &quot;You realize I can&#039;t even understand you with those ridiculous things in your mouth, right?&quot; he said, crossing his arms. &quot;Seriously, what&#039;s up with you lately? You&#039;ve been acting weird ever since you read that book this...&quot; Spike trailed off when he noticed the eavesdropper on the conversation.</p><p class="double">The unicorn raised an eyebrow as the drake&#039;s mouth hung open. Following his train of sight, her eyes fell upon the pink dragoness. She blinked, though it was quickly followed by a friendly smile. &quot;O&#039;, hhello. Fhe&#039;llow loopa?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember blinked. The unicorn glanced down at herself and then promptly blushed as she rubbed the back of her neck.</p><p class="double">&quot;O&#039;, shorri&#039;,&quot; she said, before her horn began to glow. In a flash of light, all the outlandish things she was wearing disappeared. She gave a smile. &quot;Again, sorry about that. I didn&#039;t realize we had an outside looper this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">She bowed before looking back at Ember. &quot;You must be new to the loops. I&#039;ve never seen you before, so that&#039;s a pretty good clue. I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle, the local loop anchor, by the way. You can call me Twilight, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember paused for a few seconds. Quickly remembering her manners, she was quick to bow too. &quot;Nice to meet you. I&#039;m Ember. Just Ember, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, nice to meet you, Ember,&quot; Twilight said before she raised a hoof towards the surrounding town. &quot;Let me be the first one to welcome you to Equestria. We&#039;re a sanctuary loop, which means you can unwind and relax here. Just don&#039;t do anything too disruptive, though, as we can and will send you to the moon if you cause too much trouble.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember jumped slightly, quickly raising her paws in front of her as her eyes went wide. &quot;Oh, you don&#039;t have to worry about that! I rarely ever do pranks in my home loop, and I don&#039;t generally like causing trouble, so...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, we don&#039;t mean stuff like pranks and that,&quot; Twilight said, scratching the back of her head as she gave an embarrassed smile. &quot;We mean stuff like destroying towns, seriously harming other loopers, assisting bad guys, that sort of stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double">At this, Ember gave a slight sigh before she smiled. &quot;Well, that you <i>definitely </i>don&#039;t have to worry about with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s good to hear,&quot; Twilight said, giving a more genuine smile. &quot;In that case, enjoy your stay here in Equestria! As said, you&#039;re free to do whatever you like so long as it&#039;s nothing extreme.&quot; She sat down. &quot;Anything in particular you want to do?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember paused before she too sat down. &quot;Well, I&#039;ve never really been to this universe before, and this is my first time being in a loop without someone from my universe being there with me, so I was wondering if...&quot; Ember said, glancing downward as she scratched the back of her neck. &quot;If you could introduce me to some of the other awake loopers here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure!&quot; Twilight said, giving a smile. &quot;Surprisingly, though, despite how many loopers there are in this world, there aren&#039;t that many who are awake at the moment.&quot; With that, Twilight got up and turned around. &quot;Come on. I was just about to meet the others as per usual in my baseline, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember gave a smile as she got up and began to follow Twilight. She paused, however, as she glanced down. The small purple dragon who was with Twilight was looking up at her with eyes wide and jaw dropped. Ember glanced away awkwardly, scratching the back of her neck.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh? Oh!&quot; the baby dragon exclaimed, a luminescent blush on his face as he glanced downward. &quot;I-I&#039;m Spike! Nice to meet you!&quot; he blurted out without thinking before looking over to Twilight. &quot;Uh, Twilight! Wait up!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced back to see her currently unawake assistant rushing over to her with a blush on his face. She giggled. <i>&#039;Looks like Rarity has some competition this loop.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Ember let out a slight chuckle before she was quick to catch up to them. With that, the group of three led by Twilight began their tour of the town. As she walked, Twilight raised an eyebrow and turned to Ember.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Ember? Now that I think about it, <i>have </i>we ever met before?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think so. Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not sure... I don&#039;t know why, but your voice sounds oddly familiar to me...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">111.7 </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Alright,” Fluttershy said, looking along the latest improvement of her songbird chorus. She was going to be performing at Twilight&#039;s ascension this loop, and she felt she really had a winner with this concept. “From the top!”</p><p class="double">The half-dozen orioles began to sing. Led by the purple one, they started with a succession of individual notes which blended together into a harmonious arrangement.</p><p class="double">Then the nightjar cut across them, singing a counterpoint. This threatened to overwhelm the music completely.</p><p class="double">The orioles rallied, piping up one by one, and then reprising their original theme, with a sunbird joining in at the crescendo, and the nightjar abandoned her counterpoint and wove in with the original arrangement to close out the first movement.</p><p class="double">The second movement had Discord himself participating – as a bizarre mix of secretary bird and Hoopoe. Fluttershy had instructed the birds carefully, and they one by one joined his bizarre chorus before the purple oriole reversed the process.</p><p class="double">The third movement involved a cuckoo, twenty grasshoppers, and a pair of lovebirds. (The choreography had been a challenge.)</p><p class="double">And, finally, there was the fourth movement.</p><p class="double">“Um... it&#039;s very nice so far,” Twilight allowed. “But what&#039;s that kingfisher doing?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy passed her a bird-spotter&#039;s guide with one page bookmarked, and waved her hooves for the fourth movement to start.</p><p class="double"><i>CAW</i>, went the Sombre Kingfisher.</p><p class="double">Twilight barely avoided faceplanting into the book.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">111.8</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s that,” Loki said, with a satisfied smile.</p><p class="double">His eldest son looked up. “How so?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, just checking on the results of a couple of fused loops. Took a lot of energy, but it was entirely worth it.” He pointed. “Here, one from your loop with a certain Anchor who got his start with your lot. Here, three of mine to Pern. And here, one of your lupine brother&#039;s Anchors and that place which Hel dotes on.”</p><p class="double">Sleipnir nodded. “I understand the last two. But the other one?”</p><p class="double">Loki winked. “Give me a few secrets.”</p><p class="double">“What about Jorm? Are you involving him in this?”</p><p class="double">“Oh...” Loki shrugged. “I had certain plans. Well, his code is usually involved with Pern anyway... but, anyway, I made him known to a certain research project, project 3325.”</p><p class="double">“...I have no idea what that&#039;s supposed to imply, Dad,” Sleipnir informed him. “As usual.”</p><p class="double">The door banged open, and Jormugandr slithered in. “DAD!”</p><p class="double">“But I&#039;m about to,” Sleipnir added, more positively.</p><p class="double">“Why did you give that lot my résumé?” Jormugandr asked, pleadingly. “You know as well as I do that the &#039;Jormugandr solution&#039; is just assigning me to fix all the chaos caused by time travel until I work out a code fix pattern!”</p><p class="double">Loki smirked. “Well, you <i>did</i> say you were bored.”</p><p class="double">“Once! Fifteen hundred iterations ago!” Jormugandr brought his tail around, and nibbled on it nervously. “Rrrgh... I&#039;m going to be fixing anomalies until I eat myself, I swear.”</p><p class="double">“...nope, still no idea of the specifics,” Sleipnir announced.</p><p class="double">Loki clapped him on a shoulder. “Learning&#039;s half the fun.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>112.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gilda the Griffin rolled around on her back on a cloud, mildly bored.</p><p class="double">New loops were interesting, generally, but it depended who was there and what they were doing. And until she got contacted by someone who&#039;d know for sure – like Dash or Spike – all she could do was check Element mixes and guess.</p><p class="double">There was a good spread, at least, this time. Hopefully, a few of the non-element users would be there as well, and she&#039;d be able to try a thing she&#039;d wanted to for a while – swapping places with Luna at Nightmare Night, pretend it was a <i>really good</i> costume, and muck around with raising the moon and stuff.</p><p class="double">Something was nagging her, though. What <i>was</i> it? Something to do with the Empire...</p><p class="double">Cudgeling her unresponsive brain, Gilda decided to start from the top.</p><p class="double">The Gryphon Lands. A large, complex mix of direct dependencies, vassals, client states, and aligned tribes-</p><p class="double"><i>Point one.</i> Normally the Empire was more centralized. Interesting.</p><p class="double">-spread over a few small landmasses, none of them more than fifty leagues on a side, and dozens upon dozens of minor archipelagos-</p><p class="double"><i>Point two.</i> No great plains, no mountaintop eyries... sounded like the griffins were a lot more sea-oriented this loop, and a quick check revealed her bird part to be osprey and her cat part to be almost lynx-like.</p><p class="double">A further quick check reassured her she could still do the ink magic thing with her tail. Losing <i>that</i> would have been inconvenient. Anyway, where was she...</p><p class="double">-and she had been sent over on a trading mission, since Princess Celestia had been interested in securing the services of a number of dragons-</p><p class="double"><i>...bwah?</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hiccup,” Stoic asked, slowly. “What in Niflheim are we?”</p><p class="double">Hiccup looked down at himself. “Oh, huh. Wonder where we are... just gotta wait for those loop memories to kick in. Now, are-”</p><p class="double">The coldest air in the world blasted them, ruffling their feathers.</p><p class="double"><i>Morning!</i> Toothless announced, landing gracefully between father and son, and giving an &#039;I&#039;ve-got-lots-of-teeth-but-I&#039;m-hiding-them-to-be-polite&#039; grin. Behind him, Blitsif settled to the grass.</p><p class="double">“Oh, morning Blitz,” Stoic added, nodding his beaked head to her. “Where&#039;s Thor?”</p><p class="double"><i>Fishing,</i> Blitsif told them. <i>He Woke up a bit hungry, so it&#039;ll probably rain fried cod in a few minutes.</i></p><p class="double">Hiccup grinned, which was quite a feat with a beak. “Cool. Well, may as well not waste it – Toothless, you still remember how to catch stuff with your wings?”</p><p class="double"><i>That&#039;s hatchling stuff.</i> Toothless spread his black wings to their full expansion, covering as much surface area as possible. <i>Week&#039;s worth of cat food, coming up.</i></p><p class="double">“We&#039;re only <i>half</i> cat,” Hiccup pointed out, pedantically. “Half... I think either eagle or osprey, which more or less means the same thing diet-wise, it&#039;s true...”</p><p class="double">“Which is called <i>what?</i>” Stoic stressed.</p><p class="double">Thornado materialized on cue overhead, and let off a <i>boom</i>. It duly rained fried fish.</p><p class="double"><i>Cool, fast food,</i> Toothless broadcast, then rolled his eyes at Blitsif&#039;s confusion. <i>We need to get you a nuclear-age loop soon, half my jokes go over your head.</p><p class="double">Just be glad I know what an idiom is,</i> Blitsif replied, grinning.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right, sorry.” Hiccup shook his head, inspecting his wings absently. “We&#039;re griffins, that&#039;s what.”</p><p class="double">Loop memories settled.</p><p class="double">“Pretty much the same Berk as usual, except we&#039;ve already done the reconcile-with-dragons thing...” he continued, with the air of a seasoned traveller – which he was. “Ooh, and we&#039;re nominally part of a larger empire, but in practise all that means is that we have to provide about six of us maximum on request as military service.”</p><p class="double">He shrugged, and started collecting the fish off Toothless&#039; wings. “I think they&#039;re scared of us. And – oh, wait. Yes! Jackpot!”</p><p class="double">Stoic blinked at Hiccup&#039;s sudden whoop. “What?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I was just wondering if I knew this place – and I do.” Finishing the job with the fish, he padded back over to his father and laid a wing against his side. (It took some doing – Stoic was a <i>big</i> griffin, and his son was a <i>small</i> one.) “I&#039;ve got friends here. You&#039;ll like &#039;em.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Stoic frowned. “I think.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.2</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia trotted onto the stage, to bows and applause.</p><p class="double">She turned, facing side-on to the crowd, and made a grand gesture at the curtains. “Now, please welcome – your mayor!”</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll walked slowly onto the centre of the stage, to general confusion.</p><p class="double">“Um...” Roseluck asked, raising a hoof. “Shouldn&#039;t this be the other way around?”</p><p class="double">“Not really?” Celestia replied, confused. “What do I do? Raise the sun?” She flapped her wings, dismissing it. “A trifle. It doesn&#039;t make the world go round – well, in a manner of speaking, anyway. And it is not as if I am the only pony who could do that. But your mayor...”</p><p class="double">Celestia paced the stage. “Your mayor is who keeps the town running. She ensures that Spick and Span are paid for their work keeping the streets clear, she organizes water, food, housing, balances the budget, makes sure the trains run on time – and, of course, takes the blame for whatever goes wrong.”</p><p class="double">She smiled, dishoofingly. “Oh, I do my share of paperwork, as well. It&#039;s harder, true – but for that, I get a palace, gold, servants... I&#039;m sure any pony in Equestria would want to be a Princess, at least for a day. But very few want to be Mayors.”</p><p class="double">After letting that sink in for a minute, she shrugged. “So, I&#039;ve donated my day to the Mayors and other civil servants of Equestria. It&#039;s the least I can do.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.3</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay.&quot; The unicorn flipped his mane out of his left eye, and it promptly settled back again. &quot;So, your plan is to defeat your sister, yeah?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is correct,&quot; Nightmare Moon confirmed.</p><p class="double">The unicorn tapped his hooves against the ground. &quot;Then you raise the moon into the sky.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly.&quot; The dark ruler of the night nodded again. &quot;That is the most important aspect of the plan.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See, I&#039;m right on board, yeah?&quot; He chewed on something, considering. &quot;And after that... you want to make everyone marvel at the sky overhead, as they see true art, yeah?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Precisely!&quot; Nightmare Moon bestowed a smile upon the mercenary unicorn. &quot;You catch on much quicker than any of the others ever did.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; the unicorn replied. &quot;Okay, I know <i>just</i> how to help.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...so, anyway,&quot; Celestia concluded. &quot;I threw the fight, because I was interested in seeing what this new pony might mean for the loop. And Luna pulled the moon into the centre of the sky, and was just starting to gloat, when...&quot;</p><p class="double">Her two pupils frowned at the pause.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...oh, wait,&quot; Trixie said suddenly. &quot;I think I see.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly.&quot; Celestia pointed up at the beautiful ring system that shone in Equestria&#039;s skies, day or night. &quot;Art, as he put it, is an explosion. Poor Luna...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, Deidara rigged the whole moon to explode,&quot; Trixie summarized. Then began to grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Trixie,</i>&quot; Twilight said warningly. &quot;Don&#039;t make me get the spritzer again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? I was planning true finesse. A series of tens of thousands of coordinated explosions, large and small, to <i>un</i>destroy the moon!&quot; Trixie swirled her cape, which flashed and sparkled well into the blue end of the spectrum. &quot;And then put down a little flag with Luna&#039;s cutie mark on it. I am not a monster.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.1 continued</p><p class="double"><i>I like this new setup,</i> Toothless commented, as they skimmed low over the waves. <i>Much easier on my back.</i></p><p class="double">Hiccup trimmed his feathers, lashed his tail briefly to one side to steer, and drew up on Toothless&#039; wing. “Yeah, but you&#039;d better be there when I get tired. Unlike you, I can&#039;t keep this up all day.”</p><p class="double"><i>You know it.</i> Toothless raised his head slightly to check on his own harness. <i>Yep, still on. Land there whenever you want. Payment is one fish per hour.</i></p><p class="double">“Suits me.”</p><p class="double">A little higher and further back, the rest of the dragons and riders followed in a large V formation.</p><p class="double">The twins led, their huge dragon providing the air flow that set up the others for long distance flight. On the left arm of the V, Hookfang and his rider led Meatlug and hers, with Gobber trailing (and carrying his Terror, who was making the best of the situation by napping.)</p><p class="double">On the right arm, Blitsif and Stormfly composed the main part of the formation. Thornado was trailing, largely to keep an eye on Stoic – the member of their formation <i>least</i> used to long distance flight.</p><p class="double"><i>I thought Hiccup said he knew this place,</i> Stoic grumbled to Blitsif and Thornado. <i>Why do we have to go the long way?</i></p><p class="double">The message went from them to Toothless to Hiccup.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Hiccup executed a roll in mid-air. “Basically, it&#039;s been a while, and I don&#039;t want to end up... like, fifty feet underground, or back in time, or something. When a loop you think you know is this changed, you want to <i>really</i> use fresh coordinates.”</p><p class="double">The answer was duly sent back from griffin to dragon to dragon to griffin.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m sure,</i> Stoic sent to be relayed back. Then: <i>How long is this going to take?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Well, if you&#039;re going to grumble...</i> Blitsif replied directly. <i>Hey, loudmouth, close up. Stoic and I are going the quick way.</i></p><p class="double">She shed velocity, dropped low a bit, and then came up under Stoic so he ended up on her back. With a surprised squawk (that he later denied had happened), Stoic found himself rising abruptly away from the formation.</p><p class="double">His feathers stood on end, as Blitsif began to trickle-charge from static electricity. <i>Now, get that hammer of yours out. You&#039;re going by Blitsif!</i></p><p class="double">Stoic nodded, understanding, and readied Mjolnir. Two quick spins, and it charged to the point it could achieve a lightning bolt.</p><p class="double"><i>Ready?</i> Stoic asked.</p><p class="double"><i>...now!</i> Blitsif told him.</p><p class="double">The bolt of blue-arced lightning struck one of her spines, arced to the rest, and then enveloped them in a curtain of light.</p><p class="double">Then they <i>went.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...huh,” Hiccup said, watching as the dragon and griffin shot off at about the speed of sound. “Not bad.”</p><p class="double">He glanced over at Toothless. “No, it&#039;s not a challenge.”</p><p class="double"><i>Sez you.</i> Toothless contemplated for a moment. <i>Alright, I&#039;ll be good.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia landed in front of the best tea shop in Horseshoe Bay, ready to greet the envoys from the Griffin Empire.</p><p class="double">Well, actually, she was several hours early. But she&#039;d learned, even before the loops began, that turning up early was a perfect excuse for a cuppa and a slice of cake.</p><p class="double">“Lieutenant,” she said to her duty guard commander, “Please try to avoid crowding other ponies in the shop.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” he replied, and turned. “Guard duty to form external perimeter.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ten minutes into a really very good cup of Earl Bay (the local speciality), Celestia&#039;s elevenses was interrupted by a loud BANG.</p><p class="double">“What was that?” she asked, putting her teacup down. Then, as nopony appeared to know offhand, headed outside to find out for herself.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That” turned out to be a dragon and a griffin sprawled over the main square.</p><p class="double">The dragon was moderately sized – to her, it looked about Adult or Mature Adult, possibly smaller – and festooned with the most remarkable array of spikes, some of which still sparked with residual electricity.</p><p class="double">The griffin was a large specimen of the species, and slightly... off, to her. It matched loop memories, but wasn&#039;t quite up to code with her wider experience of griffins such as Gilda.</p><p class="double">Also, his every feather and every hair of his fur were standing on end. An occasional spark blazed from it to the hammer held in his foreclaws.</p><p class="double">“Next time, Blitsif,” he muttered, “We try that when I don&#039;t have fur or feathers.”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded to herself. “I presume you are a newcomer to Equestria?” she asked. “I am Awake, if that helps, and I presume you are as well.”</p><p class="double">The griffin shook his head, instinctually tried to soothe ruffled feathers, then gave it up and looked at her. He blinked.</p><p class="double">“Huh. An&#039; I thought griffins were weird,” he said, absently.</p><p class="double">The dragon scrambled to its feet, and gave Celestia a long, careful look over. Then turned to survey the rest of the town.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” The griffin palmed his hammer, which vanished. “You&#039;re a looper, right?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed,” Celestia replied. “And your employer for the nonce, if I have this right. You <i>are</i> of the Hairy Hooligans, of Berk?” She made the connection. “Does that mean Hiccup is-”</p><p class="double">Cold air blasted the town.</p><p class="double">“Thanks for the coordinates, Blitsif!” a voice shouted from overhead. Hiccup sprang from Toothless&#039; back, came gliding down to a landing beside the larger griffin, and watched as the rest of the Berk dragons landed in the remainder of the main square.</p><p class="double">“Afternoon, Princess Celestia,” Hiccup added. “Several dragons and Vikings, reporting as requested. I see you&#039;ve met my father.”</p><p class="double">“Wonderful,” Celestia replied, both for their presence and for the fact of new Loopers for Berk. “I&#039;m afraid my schedule is rather busy, but allow me to inform you of what I require of you.” To be precise, what her pre-awakening plans had been – extra guards for Twilight. “And – I look forward to meeting you, as I am sure do many others here, ponies and otherwise.”</p><p class="double">Hiccup nodded. “Sounds good.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.4</p><p class="double">Princess Luna sighed, turning away from the moon hovering overhead. And the huge bunch of grapes emblazoned on it.</p><p class="double">Sisters loops were trying, sometimes. Especially when the fellow Sister connived with Discord to try to drive one to distraction.</p><p class="double">Hopefully, Twilight would be able to handle Berry after her thousand year detox. She didn&#039;t even want to contemplate how to handle Awake Discord, who <i>still</i> wouldn&#039;t go in the bedamned statue...</p><p class="double">“Your Highness?”</p><p class="double">Luna looked up. “Ah, Vetter. Do sit down.”</p><p class="double">When the unicorn had taken a seat, Luna went on. “Thank you for coming to see Us so quickly. We wished to discern the extent of the damage Our sister caused during her rampage.”</p><p class="double">“Um, yes...” Policy Vetter&#039;s face made an interesting shape. “About that... most of the damage was trivial, easily fixed. The remaining chaos is administrative, and...” He paused. “Irrevocable.”</p><p class="double">Luna blinked. “How can this be?”</p><p class="double">In reply, Vetter put a star map down in front of her. “This was signed into the observatory by your own hoof. It is no longer possible to revert.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn of the night sky stared, focusing on the chart. It was an accurate enough map, but...</p><p class="double">“...what are these names?” Luna asked, blinking and looking closer. “&#039;Boring Star&#039;? &#039;See Above&#039;? &#039;Emergency Backup Equestria&#039;?”</p><p class="double">Her eyes began roving all over the star chart, suddenly fearing the extent of the damage. Every star she had officially named <i>before</i> Spiked Punch had detonated the Jagernuke was still what it had been, but the rest... they bore names like Putz, Waste Of Sky, Discord Wuz Here, Hashtag Star, PLEASE REMOVE, Dry Clean Only, Just Marsh Gas, Here Be No Dragons, ***FREE TAIL PERMS*** and Go Outside And Get Some Fresh Air Because Astronomy Is Boring.</p><p class="double">“I see,” she eventually said, quite calmly. “Thank you. Now, if you will excuse me, I need to go find Discord and hit him with astronomy textbooks. I am not sure if I will ever stop.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.5</p><p class="double">“Lemon Rush?”</p><p class="double">The indicated colt turned. “Yes – oh, Shining Armor, right?”</p><p class="double">The stallion (for it was he) nodded. “That&#039;s correct.”</p><p class="double">He stepped a little closer, halting about two yards away. “I&#039;ve heard – via Twilight – that you&#039;re dating my niece.”</p><p class="double">“I am, yes,” Rush confirmed.</p><p class="double">“Right. Now, I&#039;m sure we both know how this is supposed to go.” Shining shrugged. “You know. Overprotective male relative, hurt my niece and I&#039;ll eviscerate you, and so on.”</p><p class="double">He cricked his neck. “So let&#039;s take all that as read. Instead, there&#039;s something much more important I want to discuss. Something which might make all the unpleasant business moot.”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Rush asked, interested.</p><p class="double">Shining took a breath. “Nyx is several things – overlady of the night on a time share with Princess Luna; remarkably cute; young whenever she can get away with it... but the important ones here are as follows.”</p><p class="double">In the pause, Rush took up an attentive stance. He considered getting out a notebook, but felt that would be a bit crass.</p><p class="double">“Right. Firstly – she&#039;s slow to trust. I mean, <i>really</i> trust, deep in her heart.” Shining frowned. “That&#039;s not to say she isn&#039;t comfortable with people quite quickly – quicker than usual, in fact... but that very comfort is based on her knowledge that she is not under duress.”</p><p class="double">The stallion tapped a hoof, thinking hard. “Perhaps it would be easier to say she&#039;s slow to forget. She will forgive a transgression readily enough, but it will still colour your interactions for a long, long time.”</p><p class="double">Rush nodded. “I see, and I <i>think</i> I understand. I&#039;ll try to err on the side of caution.”</p><p class="double">Shining considered him. “Good. Secondly, she may prefer to appear as a child, but not only is she fully adult but she likes to be treated as one when things are important. <i>Always</i> invite her to discussions that may concern her – if she doesn&#039;t want to be involved, she&#039;ll just blow off the meeting inside five minutes or not turn up at all. But the important thing is to give her due consideration.”</p><p class="double">Lemon absorbed that.</p><p class="double">“Finally.” Shining looked Lemon directly in the eye. “I don&#039;t know how serious your relationship is – but I do know that you should not feel in the least bit reluctant to <i>ask</i> her how serious <i>she</i> thinks it is. If she is of the impression that it is more serious than you think it is, <i>or</i> if she thinks it is less serious, then you are likely to get in trouble. Avoid that.”</p><p class="double">The Primarch waited a moment to see if there was any more, then saluted. “Got it. Thank you, Captain.”</p><p class="double">Shining nodded to him in return.</p><p class="double">“Oh, and Lemon?” he added, as the colt turned away.</p><p class="double">“Yes?”</p><p class="double">“If you value your life, tread carefully around my wife.” Shining smiled. “I sometimes think she can <i>smell</i> romance. Don&#039;t hesitate to ask me for help in... diverting... her.”</p><p class="double">Lemon gave an elaborate shudder. “Never fear on <i>that</i> front. Spike and Rarity&#039;s wedding was spectacular, but I also remember what princess Cadence did after it ended...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.6</p><p class="double">“I see.” Cheerilee wrote that down. “So, an operative should always have at least two independent fall-back locations?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right,” David confirmed. “At least one should be utterly unconnected with you in any way – I usually just open an atlas at the index and point, to get a good location – and the other should be somewhere with good records and good privacy, like Switzerland.”</p><p class="double">“And what should go in it?”</p><p class="double">“At least one weapon, several different kinds of disposable currency, and five fake ID at a minimum.” David shrugged. “Depending on the time frame, consider including a disposable mobile phone – prepaid, but unused, and with the battery separate – and a few half-filled books of small newspaper puzzles.”</p><p class="double">On seeing her surprised look, the agent smiled. “Hey, fleeing a country involves long periods of boredom on aircraft or trains. Anyway, there should also be something on your person which leads you back to one of your safes. I learned the usefulness of <i>that</i> the hard way.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve heard,” Cheerilee replied dryly. “Jason.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I don&#039;t go by that if I can help it,” David Webb said, holding up his hands. “It might count as displacement or some other psychological thing, but as far as I&#039;m concerned David Webb is the guy who didn&#039;t know what he was getting into, and Jason Bourne is the slightly deranged killer. Nowadays, I just carry a quick-mod kit for my guns which turns them into Merciful weapons, and use that if I&#039;m just fighting... hell, the police or whatever.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d try to help, but psychology is one of the things I&#039;ve not learned how to do the basics of yet.” Cheerilee gave an awkward smile. “Sorry.”</p><p class="double">“Nah, it&#039;s fine.” David leant back on the chair. “I&#039;ve had myself checked out a few times. I&#039;m assured I&#039;m on the mend, though there is a Good-aligned weapon in my pocket I check every so often. If it burns, I&#039;m backsliding.”</p><p class="double">“Sensible.” Cheerilee looked down at her page of notes. “Is that it for spycraft?”</p><p class="double">“Nearly... for the theory part.” David grinned like a shark. “Now, for the practical. In about fifty seconds, the gendarmerie comes through the ceiling thinking I&#039;m in the pay of the North Koreans trying to reignite the Falklands war, because of CIA trickery with my INTERPOL record.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee blinked at him.</p><p class="double">“My baseline&#039;s kind of crazy,” the Anchor pointed out. “Now, try to keep up. Three, two, one-”</p><p class="double">The ceiling fell in.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re crazy!” Cheerilee shouted as David dragged her through the door and down the stairs, exchanging fire with French policemen all the way.</p><p class="double">“So?” David asked, glancing around and reloading with his off hand. “Ooh, a Ferrari. Forget using the dinky little car, we&#039;re taking this! And don&#039;t forget to keep good notes on how to escape vehicular pursuit.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.1 continued</p><p class="double">As the day drew towards night, a number of winged forms landed outside Ponyville. Twilight heard the rushing of air, and exchanged a quick glance at her assistant as the newcomers slowed to a stop.</p><p class="double">“Ah, there she is,” Celestia said. “Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight turned, and waved. “Princess!”</p><p class="double">She cantered over, trailed by Spike, and caught sight of a number of familiar faces. “Hold on... Toothless? Ah, Hiccup, it&#039;s good to see you.”</p><p class="double">Hiccup grinned, coming forward to bump claw to hoof. “It&#039;s been a while, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“You know her?” one of the other griffins asked.</p><p class="double"><i>Big griffin,</i> she mused, looking around at the others in the clearing. Most of them weren&#039;t as familiar to her as the Anchor to introduce her to the wider multiverse, but she felt she at least knew the dragons... which was why it was a surprise to see two more than she was expecting. In fact, there were as many dragons as there were griffins, and that was before accounting for the two-headed Zippleback that she recalled the twins sharing.</p><p class="double">Hiccup was talking. “...strange thing, I met her fellow loopers before I met her, but that happened the very next loop. Anyway.” The feathered Viking cricked his neck. “May as well do this the local-loop way... Twilight Sparkle and Spykoranuvellitar, be known to Stoic the Vast, chief of the Hairy Hooligans – and my father. And be known to Thornado and Blitsif, dragons of the Hooligans.”</p><p class="double">The dragons waved. So did the Viking, though he was slightly slower off the mark.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Hiccup? Your father&#039;s looping?”</p><p class="double">Then she beamed. “Congratulations!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, it was an emotional moment all round,” Hiccup admitted. “And – yeah, sorry that neither of your parents are yet.”</p><p class="double">“No, no, I&#039;m...” Twilight paused. “I&#039;ve accepted it. And don&#039;t... I&#039;m happy, really. Your dad deserves it.”</p><p class="double">She kicked the floor, producing a staccato <i>clop</i>. “Anyway, we&#039;re getting a bit off topic – Spike, go tell Pinkie to switch to New Looper Party, and quick!”</p><p class="double">Spike needed no further prompting, turning on his heel and dashing for the library.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight glanced over at the building. “That gives us about three minutes before we&#039;re being made happy to the limits of Equestrian endurance. So, who are the dragons? More new loopers?”</p><p class="double">Hiccup nodded. “Yep. But I&#039;ll let the chief introduce them.” He stepped back smartly, past Stoic, who abruptly found himself in the conversation.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Er... gods, Hiccup, is this revenge for all those chiefing lessons?”</p><p class="double">“<i>Yes,</i>” Hiccup said, smiling broadly.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ll pay for that... anyway, this is Thornado, a Thunderdrum. This is Blitsif, a Skrill.” The indicated pair of dragons bobbed their heads as indicated. “They&#039;re my dragons.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Huh. You get two?”</p><p class="double"><i>There&#039;s too much of him for just one of us to carry,</i> Thornado told her solemnly. <i>We have to share the workload.</i></p><p class="double">Stoic shook his clawed foreleg at them. “And aye, they&#039;re always like this.”</p><p class="double">“Count yourself lucky,” Twilight said, smiling. “My dragon assistant got married.”</p><p class="double">Stoic absorbed that. “Well, I can see I&#039;ve got a lot to learn about this place.”</p><p class="double">At that point, Pinkie happened, and the meeting was abruptly adjourned in favour of balloon animals. (Some of them fifty feet long and made for dragons to chase. Pinkie was an equal opportunity partier.)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You,” Stoic informed the Element of Laughter solemnly, “are a delight to find in a world which looks so wholesome.”</p><p class="double">Berry shrugged. “It&#039;s just ale. It&#039;s not as if it&#039;s very spectacular. It&#039;s even got a physically possible proof.”</p><p class="double">“Aye, aye.” Stoic waved that off, and took a draught. “But I don&#039;t have a pocket big enough yet, Gobber won&#039;t give me some of his stash, and none of the rest of the Berk loopers seem to bother much with ale.”</p><p class="double">He swilled the liquid around in the mug, and took another drink, savouring it as it went down. “Let alone ale seasoned in a... honey-glazed barrel of pine wood with teak shavings. Delicious.”</p><p class="double">“I try,” Berry allowed. “Do either of your dragons want some? I see my boyfriend is entertaining them.”</p><p class="double">Stoic glanced over at the dance floor. For most of the past hour, the dragons had been enjoying what had been advertised (with a solemn seriousness which looped back around to funny) as a Disco-rd.</p><p>He still hadn&#039;t quite gotten his head around that. It was like having Drago Bludvist running a buffet...</p><p class="double">“Are there <i>any</i> villains from your baseline still around?” he asked, distracted by that thought. “I mean, there&#039;s that Nightmare Moon lass, who seems to be over there chattin&#039; to herself and Twilight and my son and Toothless; there&#039;s this Trixie who I&#039;ve been warned about not letting Thornado near; there&#039;s... Dischord?”</p><p class="double">“Discord,” Berry corrected. “Chrysalis is here as well, and even Gilda was quite unpleasant at first as I understand it. But – yes, there are a few. Sombra and Tirek come to mind.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Good</i>,” Stoic said firmly. At her confusion, he went on. “I&#039;d hate to feel like it was some kind of requirement to sort all that out.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, no, this is quite exceptional.” Berry shrugged. “Anyway, the ale thing?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right. No, don&#039;t think so.” Stoic nodded over to them. “Blitsif&#039;s more of a one for spirits, and I can&#039;t get Thornado to stop whining about Klah.”</p><p class="double">“I have some of that,” Berry offered. “I don&#039;t <i>just</i> do alcoholic beverages.”</p><p class="double">The Thunderdrum sidled over to the bar. <i>Did someone mention Klah?</i></p><p class="double">“They did, you bottomless caffeine addict,” Stoic muttered. “Quietly.”</p><p class="double"><i>I have excellent hearing,</i> Thornado informed them loftily.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re half deaf!” Stoic protested. “Were you eavesdroppin&#039; on me again?”</p><p class="double"><i>You thought about Klah, I couldn&#039;t help it.</i> Thornado tilted his head. <i>Anyway. Do you have any, pony who knows stuff about drinks?</i></p><p class="double">“Sure do.” Berry rummaged for a moment, and pulled out a flask. Four seconds of heat magic from a convenient spell, and it was steaming. “Don&#039;t drink it all at once, I&#039;ve not checked in a while how much I have left.”</p><p class="double">Thornado accepted the flask. <i>I like this place,</i> he pronounced.</p><p class="double">“I really need to learn how to store the stuff,” Stoic commented. “Or I might face some kind of revolt.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.7 (ScootaLewis)</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle awoke - and Awoke - under a large tree. After following Twilight&#039;s long-standing good advice to check the surrounding area thoroughly at the start of an unfamiliar loop, Sweetie had managed to gather a few nuggets of information.</p><p class="double">First, she was still her usual pony self. A relief, for sure.</p><p class="double">Second, the tree she was under was one of many that appeared to be making the soothing sound that had been in her ears since she woke up - its leaves were a peculiar shape, and the wind moving through them produced a tinkling that was pleasant but pervasive. She quietly mused to herself on the idea of grabbing a sample for Applejack; musical trees would be neat to have around.</p><p class="double">Three, there was a very large otter in a green peaked cap bent over her, with a good-natured grin on his face.</p><p>Sweetie barely had time to register the fact before it spoke, with what sounded like a Trottingham accent.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Ere, luv, I don&#039;t suppose you happen to &#039;ave been repeatin&#039; a certain slice o&#039; your life over &#039;n&#039; over?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie also took a few moments to digest this information. Realization dawned, and she smiled herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;I certainly have! And by the sound of it, probably more than you, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, really?&quot; He sounded quite affronted. &quot;I&#039;ll have you know this is me 12th time around! Though it&#039;s certainly the first time anyone but Jon-Tom&#039;s showed up, so there&#039;s that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie&#039;s smile got a little more smug. She got to give the multiverse speech for the first time!</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I can&#039;t say for sure, but I&#039;ve definitely had a bit more than 12 loops. I lost count around a few hundred, and that was ages ago. I guess this is the first time any of your company have been replaced?&quot;</p><p class="double">As the otter mulled it over, she checked the loop memories that were coming in. Huh. She had been playing with Bloom and Scoots at the treehouse, until she suddenly blacked out and woke up here. No idea why, or how, but probably magic. The otter&#039;s attire looked less refined than anything she&#039;d seen in Ponyville - probably a low-tech loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. Yeah, I reck&#039;n so. Why d&#039;yer ask?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This&#039;ll be your first Fused Loop, then...I better start from the top. Basically, every universe - and there&#039;s WAY more than one - is inside a big tree, and something bad happened to that tree. The people who tend that tree made it so that time repeated for all the people in those universes while they tried to fix it. To keep the universes stable, they made it so that at least one person for every universe could remember it every time their world &quot;reset&quot;. That person is called an Anchor, and they keep their world rooted so that there&#039;s some record of the original at all times. Anyway, each &quot;looping&quot; universe is like a branch on that tree, and when the branches cross over each other, it results in a &quot;Fused Loop&quot;, where two universes cross over and people from one experience the world of the other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So...me entire world is a branch on a giant tree, and your world&#039;s branch touched mine which is why you&#039;re here instead of Jon-Tom.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty much, yep. Is Jon-Tom one of the other people from here, then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. Usually I start rememberin&#039; just about when he shows up, and he only remembers about half of the time.</p><p class="double">It&#039;s gotten easier to keep him outta trouble, though, the naive git.&quot; He paused. &quot;That puts me in mind o&#039; somethin; we &#039;aven&#039;t been prop&#039;ly introduced. Me name&#039;s Mudge, and I&#039;m usually a thief, a gambler, a drunk, and an incorrigible womanizer. Ever since the end of me first loop, though, when I met me wife, I&#039;ve tried to clean meself up so&#039;s I can stay more presentable when I eventually meet her. How&#039;s about you, lass?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m Sweetie Belle; my world is called Equestria, and I&#039;m a young unicorn. My Anchor is another, called Twilight Sparkle, and she&#039;s way more experienced at this than I am. I wonder...does your...&quot;Jon-Tom&quot; do much singing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, bloody hell, he does that. &#039;E&#039;s what&#039;s called a Spellsinger, &#039;ere, which means he can do some downright impressive stuff when he gets goin&#039;. He needs his instrument to do it, though. Why did you mention it? Don&#039;t tell me you&#039;re a Spellsinger too. Even now I can barely handle his mad magical mishaps.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I dunno about a spellsinger, but as a unicorn of Equestria I have magic - though it&#039;s pretty weak since I&#039;m just a filly - and my special talent is singing. So, hey, if we can find an instrument, I guess I can give it a shot!&quot;</p><p class="double">Mudge pinched his nose, such as he could - a gesture learned from Jon-Tom. This would be a long loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, then. Round about now, I take Jon-Tom to see the resident wizard of these here Bellwoods, a senile turtle called Clothahump.&quot; Sweetie giggled at the name. &quot;Shush, you. Batty or not, he&#039;s a ruddy powerful mage, and he&#039;s threatened me enough times that even now I&#039;m fairly scared of him. But he&#039;s nice enough, and when he finds out he brought you here he&#039;ll probably apologise profusely. Maybe mentioning that you can do magic from the start will liven things up, though. You might even get better at it, learning from the old git.&quot;</p><p class="double">The otter and the unicorn strolled through the tuneless tinkling of the Bellwoods, each smiling at the possibilities the loops had brought them now. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.8 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as she awoke, in both senses of the world, to a place neither her library nor the meadow where she first read about Nightmare Moon&#039;s return. It was a room with a small window that oversaw Ponyville&#039;s Library. The bed she lay on was white and the walls were a simple turquoise, designed to invoke peaceful feelings in those who live within. There was even a bookshelf to the side of the bed with several of her favorite classic works and even a few Daring Do stories. Two things were off with the situation, however. Her horn was wrapped in an insulation material designed to nullify her magic, and the door was one more typical for a security room. She checked her memories, which caused her to stagger since they were her baseline memories.</p><p class="double">She briefly contemplated her options. Panicking was right out, since she had faced much worse awakenings. Ascending to alicorn status was an option for later should it prove necessary, but for now she decided to go with it. She lay back in her bed and took a nap. Whatever this loop&#039;s game was, it could wait.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Moments after Twilight&#039;s eyes closed, they opened again to her Library, with her friends all gathered around her. Twilight looked sheepish, &quot;Uh, girls, what are you doing here? Did you all sleep walk here and are you awake now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed, &quot;Yeah, we&#039;re all loopin&#039;. Pinkie, tell her, would ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie was bouncing up and down several times, &quot;Hey Twilight! Guess what, guess what! You remember that loop where Nyx and I were imaginary friends?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight felt a headache coming on, &quot;...yes...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Weeellll, it&#039;s kinda like that, except we&#039;re all your imaginary friends, and your baseline self has been a bit more out of it than that the last time Raine Sage looped in and you helped her edit the History of the Multiverse, volume four-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So basically,&quot; Twilight rubbed her head, &quot;I&#039;m in a Psychiatric Hospital, you all are figments of my imagination and I&#039;ve shielded myself from outside interference with a magical shield.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie tapped her ching for a second, then nodded, &quot;Yepperoni! Well, the last one is more unresponsive to outside stimuli, but close enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack cut in, &quot;Well, not quite, see we&#039;re all based off ponies ya run across in the hospital.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, &quot;Great. Well, this is something new.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>The Next Morning:</b></p><p class="double">Twilight awoke just as the sun started peeking its way through the window. She reached up and tried pulling off the magical insulator cone, but it was secured on there by a spell of some sort. Magic was out at this point. Instead, she closed her eyes and dug deep, reaching for and tugging at a different energy source. It wasn&#039;t one she used ordinarily, much preferring to stick with her magic or the Force. However, the force couldn&#039;t do what she needed this energy to perform. A second later, it was like a plug had been removed, and chakra started flowing through her body. The next step would be even more difficult, since seal-less jutsu were ridiculously difficult under ideal circumstances. Seconds later, her body started glowing blue as she finished gathering enough for this one jutsu and called out its name. With a puff of smoke, her mouth curled into a grin.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately, that was exactly the moment another pony decided to arrive.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Doctor Applejack was a simple psychologist. She enjoyed working at Ponyville Psychiatric Hospital. She had helped countless patients recover from their mental conditions. There had been quite a few odd things the patients had done over the last couple years. However, it paled on comparison to walking in to a single patient room with some food and a plan to read a Daring Do novel to Twilight, only when the door opened, She found not one, but six ponies present. All of them were familiar too. There was Rarity from the children&#039;s wing, Pinkie Pie who was another of Applejack&#039;s patients, Rainbow Dash who had been a recent arrival, a pegasus she didn&#039;t quite recognize, but was sure she was another inmate she had seen in passing, and then the crown, a perfect duplicate of herself.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked at the doctor and said sheepishly, &quot;Uh, doctor...I can explain everything.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>One week later:</b></p><p class="double">Twilight and five other ponies found themselves resting in Ponyville Library under close supervision of the Princesses and the doctors of Ponyville Psychiatric hospital. Rarity asked, &quot;Twilight, dear, tell me again how did you manage to get the necessary DNA to make these clone bodies?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, &quot;Applejack and Rarity parted with samples as long as we would teach them how to do the Shadow Clone Jutsu. Pinkie Pie just approached her doctor and gave permission without being prompted. Fluttershy only allowed it if our Fluttershy would visit her every so often. As for Rainbow Dash, she wasn&#039;t willing so I used genetic samples obtained from one of her pegasus eggs loops.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">111.6 continued (<b>TokoWH</b>)</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s tree library was bustling and Ember&#039;s &#039;Welcome to Ponyville&#039; party was in full swing. This loop had been rather interesting so far. As it stood, despite Twilight informing her that they possessed quite possibly the largest amount of loopers, this loop only three others were really awake. From what she had told Ember, she&#039;d meet two of the three eventually. For now, though, there was only one other looper in the immediate area.</p><p class="double">&quot;So then, dearie, how are you enjoying our loop so far?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember turned around, coming face to face with a white mare with a glorious mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m really enjoying it,&quot; Ember said, giving Rarity a soft smile. &quot;I was a bit unnerved at first, since this is my first fused loop by myself, but all the loopers here so far have been really nice.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s good to hear,&quot; Rarity said, sitting down at the table Ember was at. &quot;If you ever need anything, feel free to ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember had a grin on her face. There was a short pause and only the sounds from those enjoying the party could be heard. Ember blinked, an odd feeling like she was being watched coming over her. She turned her head to look behind her, catching Rarity&#039;s attention in the process and making her look as well. The two ladies caught sight of the purple head of a small dragon whose emerald eyes were peeking out from behind a chair. Realizing he had been spotted, Spike quickly jumped and dashed away, a luminous blush on his face. Both girls giggled at the sight.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still find it a bit hard to believe that you&#039;re married to the looping Spike,&quot; Ember said, looking back at Rarity. &quot;I mean, I know you two have apparently been looping for many, many years, but it&#039;s hard to view him as an adult dragon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, it takes quite a few loopers to wrap their heads around it at first,&quot; Rarity said, a slight smile on her face. &quot;Looping Spike has grown up a lot compared to his baseline self, though, and he also managed to gain complete control over how mentality can affect the age and size of his body. He&#039;s one of the few loopers whose body can grow alongside his mentality.&quot; Rarity have a slight giggle before shaking her head. &quot;The next you&#039;re here while he&#039;s awake, deary, you should see if he can teach you how to do so as well. It&#039;s a very rare thing for looper&#039;s bodies to actually age in the loops, and it&#039;s usually an ability most loopers would love to have.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no, that&#039;s alright,&quot; Ember said, putting her paws in front of her. &quot;I&#039;m quite happy with my body the way it is. Besides, I&#039;m not sure if Dragon Realm dragons can actually do that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember turned back to the table and paused, nervously shifting her eyes. &quot;Um, sorry about...uh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s alright, dearie,&quot; Rarity said, shaking her head. &quot;I know my Spike, the awake one, wouldn&#039;t so much as look at another women. Besides, I&#039;m not the jealous type.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a silent pause as Rarity glanced over to see Spike looking down from the balcony, though he quickly ducked back when he saw Rarity looking in his direction. Rarity narrowed her eyes slightly. She was unable to make out exactly who Spike was looking at. A few seconds passed before Rarity looked forward and hovered a small glass up to her lips.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Though, do keep in mind, dearie,&quot; Rarity said before she took a sip, her voice a tad bit more serious than before. &quot;If you do decide to humor his childish crush, keep in mind that his awake self <i>is </i>a married dragon.&quot; In a small flash of light, her wedding ring appeared on her horn.</p><p class="double">Ember gave a slight nervous chuckle, quickly raising her paws in front of her as she gave a nervous grin. &quot;Oh, you don&#039;t have to worry about that! I don&#039;t go after those who are already in a relationship, and even if he&#039;s technically older than I am—&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity took a deep breath, shaking her head as her expression lightened. &quot;I&#039;m sorry about that. I have no <i>idea </i>what came over me there.&quot; She placed her wedding ring back in her subspace.</p><p class="double">Once again, Ember chuckled nervously. Just as things began to get uncomfortably silent, Twilight walked up to them. Giving a small smile, she sat down. &quot;So how have things been so far?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember turned to Twilight, a wide smile on her face. &quot;Pretty good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s good to hear,&quot; Twilight said with a smile before turning to Rarity. &quot;Anyway, any ideas on how to deal with Nightmare Moon?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm...&quot; Rarity said, placing a hoof to her chin. &quot;...Trapping her in drapery?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Done it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Trap her in a bubble?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Done it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hm... Drop octopi on her?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Done it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember watched on with a blank stare as Twilight and Rarity bantered ideas back and forth. Finally, Ember shook her head. &quot;Um, excuse me?&quot; she asked, butting into the conversation. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked, looking at Ember. &quot;Oh, right!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;We haven&#039;t told her about that yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Twilight brought out the ever famous book she was almost always reading at the start of her loop. As the book was floated over, Ember carefully took it in both claws.</p><p class="double">&quot;You can keep that if you want. Birch only knows how easy it is for me to get more copies of that,&quot; Twilight said, rolling her eyes. &quot;It goes into quite a few details about it, but to give you the abridged version: Nightmare Moon is the evil alter ego of Princess Luna, who used to rule alongside her sister Princess Celestia over a thousand years ago. She controlled the moon and night, as Celestia did the sun and the day.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;However, Princess Luna eventually grew jealous of Celestia, with how ponies usually slept through the night and were more active during the day,&quot; Rarity joined in, putting her glass on the table.</p><p class="double">&quot;In her jealousy, Luna sought to overthrow Celestia so that her night would reign supreme and never go unappreciated again, becoming Nightmare Moon in the process. Nightmare Moon attempted an attack on Celestia, but even though it seemed like she had won, Princess Celestia used the Elements of Harmony to stop her, imprisoning her on the moon,&quot; Twilight said, raising her hoof. &quot;And after a thousand years, she is to escape this Summer Sun Celebration.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember listened to the story with wide eyes. She opened the book, flipping a few pages in and seeing the respective images of white and blue winged unicorns. Looking back up, she stared. &quot;Wait, did you say <i>this </i>Summer Sun Celebration? Isn&#039;t that...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, oh! No need to worry! Taking care of Nightmare Moon is rather easy for us at this point,&quot; Twilight said, waving her hoof in front of her in reassurance. &quot;It&#039;s actually become a bit of a game for us. How unconventionally can we defeat Nightmare Moon? Without accidentally traumatizing Luna when she reverts back, of course.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So far, we&#039;ve pretty much done everything from sicking Spikezilla on her to trapping her in a bubble,&quot; Rarity added, though she was quick to scratch the back of her neck. &quot;Of course, Spikezilla was back during our earlier looping days, and something we&#039;re not particularly proud of...&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember blinked. &quot;How did you defeat her in baseline?&quot; she asked, tilting her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, normally, my friends and I are supposed to travel into the Everfree Forest to the old castle, where we&#039;d get the Elements of Harmony and use them to expel the evil in Luna,&quot; Twilight explained, giving a slight sigh. &quot;Of course, I&#039;m a lot less crabby about it now than I was my first time through.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, why don&#039;t you use those? I&#039;d be interested to see how things went with you girls the first time through,&quot; Ember said, giving a small smile.</p><p class="double">Rarity paused, looking upwards as she put a hoof to her chin. Shortly after, she turned to Twilight. &quot;How about it, Twilight? Now that I think of it, it <i>has </i>been quite a while since we last went along with the baseline.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe,&quot; Twilight said, putting a hoof to her chin. &quot;Ember appears to be replacing Fluttershy, though. Though outside loopers getting a husk element isn&#039;t unheard of, whether or not she gets kindness specifically has yet to be seen. Of course, juggling around the Elements between us is nothing new...&quot; Twilight said, slowly becoming more and more lost in her ramblings. Finally, she jumped slightly. &quot;Oh, and, of course, if Ember will be willing to wield an element.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ember paused, her expression blank. <i>&#039;I&#039;m not even sure what an Element of Harmony is...&#039; </i>she thought, her expression remaining unreadable. <i>&#039;I don&#039;t think even Spyro has tried using stuff from other loops yet. I&#039;m not even sure if it&#039;ll work because I&#039;m replacing the normal user of it.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Ember glanced down, a slight frown on her face. <i>&#039;And yet... I don&#039;t know why...&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Ember looked back up, a grin on her face as a determined glint appeared in her eyes. &quot;Alright! Considering I&#039;m replacing one of the people who normally wields it, I suppose it&#039;s only fair.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, alright then! It&#039;s settled!&quot; Twilight exclaimed, a smile on her face. &quot;For a change, we&#039;ll actually go along with the baseline method.&quot;</p><p class="double">An upbeat aura came over the group as Twilight and Rarity began discussing the specifics and what to do if things somehow went wrong. Ember watched them with a smile for a moment, then glanced out the nearby window. The moon glowing eerily in the sky. It had almost reached its peak. A nervous frown creased her face.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Oh boy... What have I just gotten myself into?&#039;</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.1 continued</p><p class="double">“Not bad,” Twilight allowed, looking at the heavily concussed Tirek lying on the floor. “How&#039;d you pull <i>that</i> off?”</p><p class="double">“Little help from my son,” Stoic allowed, hefting a very large hammer. “Field of antimagic on my body, and there wasn&#039;t anything for him to drain. Then I just hit him a lot.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Twilight nodded. “I see. So, the simple solution then?”</p><p class="double">“Sometimes works best,” Stoic confirmed. “Now, that <i>is</i> about it, right?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much it for our loop, yes.” Twilight shrugged. “So far, anyway. How have you liked it here?”</p><p class="double">The burly griffin considered that. “Good, I think,” he allowed. “You&#039;re all very accommodating, which is nice – that Gilda was especially helpful with, er, the... you know, griffin thing – but at the same time, it isn&#039;t boring.”</p><p class="double">He shrugged his wings with care. “One downside of Pern, it&#039;s a wee bit repetitive at times.”</p><p class="double">“I see what you mean,” Twilight said, with another nod. “Yes, we do try to make sure that there are challenges – for those who want them.”</p><p class="double">She indicated the groaning centaur. “Case in point.”</p><p class="double">“And the non-looping villagers are pretty nice too,” Stoic went on. “I mean, they got used to the dragons pretty sharpish. Well, mostly.”</p><p class="double">As he spoke, Roseluck crossed the square heading to the shops. She had a pair of blinkers on, and was determinedly looking straight ahead.</p><p class="double">“I did talk to her about that.” Twilight winced. “She does understand, it&#039;s just... well, she can&#039;t get over the fear response. The blinkers are a compromise, and we agreed on it.”</p><p class="double">“Aye, well.” Stoic rubbed his beak with a claw. “Suppose it&#039;s the best we can hope for.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, awkwardly. “That&#039;s the way of things, I think. Muddle through as best we all can.”</p><p class="double">“As for you,” she went on, more brightly, “I&#039;m glad to see you&#039;re getting on so well with looping.”</p><p class="double">“Thank Hiccup, not me,” Stoic told her. “And Blitsif and Thornado, of course. It&#039;s still painful, knowing my wife isn&#039;t with me,” he added, with a sigh. “But those two keep me grounded.”</p><p class="double">“From what I&#039;ve heard, those two are more likely to need grounding <i>from</i> you.” Twilight smiled. “Anyway, I need to go see Pinkie. It&#039;s not long until the end-of-loop party, and-”</p><p class="double">There was a loud <i>boom</i>.</p><p class="double">“Oh, not again,” she sighed, and turned to look out over Ponyville.</p><p class="double">Sure enough, her library was on fire.</p><p class="double">Thornado flapped to a halt on a rooftop. <i>Sorry,</i> he said, wincing. <i>My fault, I sneezed. Hold on a minute.</i></p><p class="double">He took flight again, and vanished.</p><p class="double">There was a splashing noise, loud enough to be heard even over the distance from there to the dam, and then Thornado reappeared and dumped about ten tons of water on the tree-library.</p><p class="double">Twilight blanched, and vanished in a teleport of her own.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...the fire was bad enough, but to dump <i>water</i> on it as well?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “It&#039;s a library! Fire and flood... what could be worse?”</p><p class="double">Hiccup pointed a claw at her. “You know as well as I do that all your books were too well shielded to be damaged.”</p><p class="double">“It is the principle of the thing!”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, then looked back up at her fellow Anchor. “You&#039;re right, of course. This is practically nothing by the standards of what usually happens to my library.”</p><p class="double">There was a crack of tearing air.</p><p class="double">“And I installed a lightning rod,” she went on, without missing a beat. “So that&#039;s all sorted out.”</p><p class="double">Hiccup had to chuckle. “Nice work. Well, nice seeing you, Twilight. And it&#039;s been too long since I last saw Spike.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to him. “Do convey my greetings to Leah next time you see her, it&#039;s been a while since I saw her as well. I want to make sure she&#039;s alright.”</p><p class="double">“She will be,” Hiccup said, shrugging. “I know what her baseline was like, but by now she&#039;s as tough as old boots and twice as good at kicking jerks.”</p><p class="double">Toothless shouldered the door open. <i>Are you two going to join in the party or what?</i></p><p class="double">“Well, we&#039;d better go,” Hiccup nodded towards the door. “The unholy offspring of lightning and death has spoken.”</p><p class="double">“Ooh!” Pinkie said, poking her head through the door just underneath Toothless. “Is it time for you to Get Down with a Night Fury?”</p><p class="double"><i>I could just sit on you, you know,</i> Toothless observed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.9 </p><p class="double">“Behold!” the changeling queen called. “Behold the might of my changeling horde!”</p><p class="double">She then launched into a really rather respectable musical number written for a solo part and ten-voice harmony backing.</p><p class="double">“Er...” Twilight raised a hoof. “Shouldn&#039;t you be, well... infiltrating?”</p><p class="double">The queen reached the end of her song (it had started off being about ultimate power, but had somehow switched topics to pies).</p><p class="double">“Oh, probably,” she admitted. “I just thought – what&#039;s the point? I mean, it&#039;s not as if there&#039;s something I actually <i>need</i> from an invasion.”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned, then decided this had to be a looper. “Why not?” she asked, choosing to pull the thread and see where this went.</p><p class="double">“Well, I don&#039;t need <i>much</i> in the way of love,” the queen explained. “I mean, I only <i>have</i> ten changelings.”</p><p class="double">She paused for a moment, then smiled and tapped one on the shoulder. “Of course I love <i>you</i>.”</p><p class="double">The other changeling – one with gold highlights instead of the usual green – looked mollified.</p><p class="double">“Only <i>ten</i>?” Twilight blinked. “That&#039;s... well, actually quite ridiculously small.”</p><p class="double">“But it means I know them all by name,” the queen replied easily. “This here is Beauty, and this is Rocky, and these two are Diver and Poll.” She looked up. “I&#039;m not boring you, am I?”</p><p class="double">“You tell me, you&#039;re the telempath,” Twilight retorted.</p><p class="double">“Actually, it&#039;s hard enough sorting out the voices of just ten changelings,” the queen replied. “Especially when they&#039;re keeping up a running commentary. Anyway, these three are Mimic-”</p><p class="double">“At last, a proper changeling name,” Twilight interrupted.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t expect it to last,” the queen said. “And these are Lazybones and Brownie. These two ones with the green highlights are Auntie One and Auntie Two, and the blue one is Uncle.”</p><p class="double">“Auntie One and Auntie Two...” Twilight repeated. “Wait a second, I know who you are!”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” The queen raised an eyebrow. “Do tell.”</p><p class="double">“Welcome to Equestria, Menolly,” Twilight said by way of answer. “I should have realized sooner. How often do you see a <i>brown</i> changeling?”</p><p class="double">Mimic looked hurt, and transformed into a copy of Twilight. Brownie looked down at himself and shrugged, and Lazybones had already fallen asleep.</p><p class="double">“I have to say, though, this <i>does</i> explain how early you attacked,” she added. “If you can call this an attack. I mean, usually there&#039;s an Ursa around this time...”</p><p class="double">The library window banged open.</p><p class="double">“Trixie is still not speaking to that har-”</p><p class="double">“Trixie,” Twilight said warningly.</p><p class="double">“-per.” Trixie looked mulish for a moment. “Trixie does appreciate that the harper in question is not behind the disappearance of her marefriend, but she is also a little bit moody right now.”</p><p class="double">The window banged shut again.</p><p class="double">“So, anyway,” Twilight said, brightly. “Have you met Sweetie Belle before?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t think so,” Menolly answered, as Beauty started organizing the rest of the hordette to put their instruments away again. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, she&#039;s a musician by trade and talent,” Twilight told her. “She was Sebell once – barely needed a name change... anyway, she once helped sing Arda into existence.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Menolly looked interested at that. “Perhaps we should compare notes...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sorry?” F&#039;lar asked. “Could you repeat that?”</p><p class="double">“I said,” Chrystal repeated, slowly, then paused. “Shut up!” she shouted.</p><p class="double">The deafening cacophany of wings abated, replaced by the occasional shifting of clawed feet on grass. </p><p class="double">There was still a <i>lot</i> of noise, given how many sets of clawed feet there were. But it was manageable.</p><p class="double">“Anyway,” Chrystal continued, projecting her voice with all the force her sixteen-year-old body could manage. “I appear to have Impressed a very large number of fire lizards.”</p><p class="double">She scanned the field – and the other fields, covered by shifting multicolored bodies all the way to the horizon. “Possibly all of them.”</p><p class="double">With a cough, she returned her attention to the Benden Weyrleader. “Do you have a need of about thirty-five thousand fire lizards?”</p><p class="double">“Not that I can think of, no...” F&#039;lar admitted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">112.10 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">Twilight landed in Ponyville once again, speaking with Spike in a long-established code for establishing their respective plans for what seemed to be another baseline Loop. She came to a halt when she noticed a striking shift from the norm.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie&#039;s not here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike frowned and muttered, &quot;Wait, why would you want to open a gate to the Elemental Plane of Laughter after last time?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head and leaned close to him. &quot;Just thinking out loud. I meant that Pinkie literally isn&#039;t here. She should&#039;ve gasped and darted off to plan the surprise party by now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, we&#039;re there already?&quot; Spike shrugged. &quot;Eh, no big deal. Either she has a replacement or she&#039;s planning something.&quot; At a more conversational volume, he asked, &quot;So, will this affect your plans for tonight&#039;s festivities?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I was considering the traditional approach. I may need to make a few adjustments, but it should still work.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A week later, Twilight couldn&#039;t take any more. Constant vigilance for somepony with Pinkie&#039;s capabilities was exhausting. As such, she found herself in Sugarcube Corner, knocking on a door. &quot;Pinkie? We&#039;re starting to get worried out here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh?&quot; The response was drowsy and slurred. &quot;Oh. Oh!&quot; The door flew open, and Pinkie latched herself onto Twilight like a cotton candy barnacle. &quot;I&#039;m so so so sorry, Twilight! My thoughts were just running around in circles and I decided to try to meditate a little and so I imagined there was paint drying on the ceiling and then it got dark and light a couple times and that must have been Celestia and Luna and how&#039;d you deal with Nightmare Moon?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paused for a moment to catch up with the rant. &quot;Berry&#039;s Awake, so she subbed in for you. I realize this may seem like a silly question, but have you eaten?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, don&#039;t worry about little old me, come in, come in!&quot; Pinkie all but shoved Twilight into her room, shutting the door behind her.</p><p class="double">Inside, the unicorn could see a few plates and tins with the distinctive &quot;licked-clean&quot; appearance that told of a past powwow with a peckish Pinkie Pie. &quot;Let me guess, emergency cakes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And emergency pies. Never know when you might Loop into a famine situation.&quot; Pinkie seemed almost subdued now that they were alone, her speech less bubbly, her gaze directed nowhere in particular.</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. &quot;Okay, so what&#039;s been occupying your mind all week?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie sat down and rested her head on her forelegs. &quot;I think I found something I can&#039;t solve with parties.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheese Sandwich with the Alicorn Amulet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a moment to process this. Then another. &quot;I... uh...&quot; Nope, not enough. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it turns out that trying to out-party a regime of mandatory fun just results in mutually amused destruction. Lina getting involved didn&#039;t help. At all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Party nukes?&quot; Twilight asked with a wince.</p><p class="double">&quot;Party nuclear winter. Which is kind of like a really big Hearth&#039;s Warming party, but not even I like that much eggnog.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you know we&#039;re here if you need us, Pinkie.&quot; Twilight very carefully didn&#039;t add &quot;for all the good it would do.&quot; </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>113.1&nbsp;&nbsp;(Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double">Twilight twitched her feathers and clacked her beak before taking a moment to smooth down the fur on her new hindquarters. &quot;Even with all the Loops I&#039;ve been through I <i>still</i> can&#039;t get used to a D&amp;D Reincarnation spell. Thanks, Flutters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...&quot; Fluttershy dug bashfully in the dirt in front of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s the matter?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I didn&#039;t cast the spell. It just happened.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, <i>larch</i>, one of <i>those</i> loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">An elegant voice called from outside the room. &quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Twilight snarked. &quot;Yes, Rarity...?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.2 (DrTempo)</p><p class="double">Twilight had walked into Mac&#039;s Bar, having heard Sunset Shimmer was there. Seeing her friend sitting down, Twilight sat next to her, and asked, &quot;Hey, Sunset. What are you thinking about?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset sighed. &quot;Something that&#039;s been bothering me ever since I started Looping.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ever the helpful friend, Twilight asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset, taking a deep breath, said, &quot;I&#039;m...not too sure I want to become an Alicorn. I know I once dreamed of it, but when I put on that crown, I saw how unfit I was to wield that level of power. Though I&#039;ve become strong throughout the Loops, I still fear that if I reach that level, that I&#039;ll lose my sanity again. I just don&#039;t trust myself yet. You understand, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Of course I do, Sunset. I can understand why you&#039;re worried. I hope you&#039;ll feel unafraid of that someday, but that&#039;s your decision. You know some of us haven&#039;t become Alicorns yet.&quot; After looking at Big Macintosh, she continued, &quot;Just take your time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset chuckled, saying, &quot;Time&#039;s the one thing we all have.&quot; The two chuckled, and enjoyed a drink.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.3 (Midnight Crescent)</p><p class="double"><u>Twilight the Underdog - Chapter 5</u></p><p class="double">Nyx sighed as the nurse left her room. “Tristan, are you there?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I’m here,” Tristan returned to his chair. “You alright there, Nyx?”</p><p class="double">Nyx nodded slightly. “Just wish they’d stop poking me already. Are they gonna stop doing that before Momma gets back?”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, but they usually don’t.” Tristan leant back in his chair, trying to think how things usually went for Serenity in the baseline. “I spoke to Twilight while I was outside.”</p><p class="double">“Why didn’t you wait?” Nyx turned to face him, a small pout starting. “I wanted to talk to her too!”</p><p class="double">“I know, and I’m sorry.” Tristan kept his voice soft. “But given my nap, I figured letting her know nothing had happened was probably a good idea. Did Yugi tell you what happened at the shop after she beat his Grandpa?”</p><p class="double">Nyx giggled and nodded.</p><p class="double">“Now imagine what she’d have been like if I’d put the call off any more.”</p><p class="double">Nyx winced. “Ok, point taken,” she yawned as she leant back into her pillow. “So what do we do now?”</p><p class="double">“No idea,” Tristan replied, shrugging his shoulders for his own benefit. “I’d teach you to duel, but they don’t make Braille cards,” Tristain thought for a few seconds, before something came to him. “And I doubt you’d be able to use them even if I did.”</p><p class="double">Nyx shook her head. “Braille isn’t something momma’s got round to teaching me yet.”</p><p class="double">Tristan sat in thought for a few seconds “Hey, I know. Why don’t you tell me about your baseline?”</p><p class="double">Nyx froze for a few seconds. “M-my baseline?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we’re gonna be spending a fair bit of time together. Might be easier if we know a bit more about each other.”</p><p class="double">“W-well, why not tell me yours first?” Nyx folded her arms across her chest.</p><p class="double">“Nyx... Is something wrong?” Tristan looked concerned at the sudden shift in the girl’s personality. “If you don’t want to talk about it, then don’t worry. I can always just ask Twi...”</p><p class="double">“NO!” Nyx practically screamed the word. “I... I’ll tell you... Just, don’t mention this to Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, I promise.” Tristan watched the girl carefully. Her voice seemed to be all over the place. From her usual speaking manner, to a petulant child. And now, she sounded... old. Old and tired.</p><p class="double">Nyx took one deep calming breath, and mentally prepared herself for what she was about to do. “I’m... not from the baseline...” Nyx’s voice shrank as she spoke.</p><p class="double">“You’re not from your baseline?” Tristan raised an eyebrow. “How does that work?”</p><p class="double">Nyx bit her lip. “It’s a long story. And if I start, I can’t stop,” Nyx took a few deep breaths. “No matter how much you’ll want me to, how much <i>I’ll</i> want to, if I start telling you, you need to hear it all. ”</p><p class="double">Tristan thought for a few seconds. <i>OK, on the one hand, she </i><i><b>really</b></i><i> doesn’t want to tell this story. But, it sounds like this is weighing down on her pretty bad...</i> Tristan massaged his temple, as he struggled to come up with a solution.</p><p class="double">After almost a minute, he had his answer. “Alright, tell me.”</p><p class="double">Nyx nodded slowly. She closed her eyes, took one deep breath, and started her story.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx was worried by how long the silence lasted after she’d finished. “Tr...Tristan, are you still there?” Her voice was shaky, and tears were slowly rolling down her face.</p><p class="double">“I’m still here Nyx,” his voice was small. He gulped before he continued. “I just need to think, okay? You kinda dropped a lot on me.”</p><p class="double">“I’m so...” Nyx started, but Tristan cut her off.</p><p class="double">“Don’t. I asked you to tell me. It’s on me. It’s just... a lot to take in at once. Give me a few minutes.”</p><p class="double">“A...Alright.” Nyx said, before rolling over, sinking her face into the pillows as much as she could without smothering herself.</p><p class="double">Tristan rested his elbows on his knees, and sank his head into his hands, as he thought over everything he’d been told over the last few hours.</p><p class="double"><i>Alright, first question, do I believe her? </i>He asked himself. <i>Well, if she was lying, why would she say she’s the reincarnation of an evil personality? </i>He considered that for a few seconds, before he realised he didn’t really have any response. <i>Good point... So, what do I do?</i></p><p class="double">After a few minutes, he reviewed the story in his head one last time, trying to break it down.</p><p class="double"><i>So, she was intended to be pure evil.</i></p><p class="double"><i>She sure didn’t turn out that way. And she didn’t ask for it either...</i></p><p class="double"><i>She did turn back into Nightmare Moon...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Did she really? She never really acted like what that cult expected. And, again, she didn’t ask for that. They had to lead her into doing anything they wanted. And even then, she wasn’t what they wanted. She even saved the town full of people who wanted to be rid of her. And they still didn’t trust her.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Can you blame them?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Can you hear yourself?</i></p><p class="double">Tristan snapped bolt upright at that last thought, the warring voices in his head quickly replaced by his own.</p><p class="double"><i>She’s alone, she’s scared, and she can’t even see. I’m here to help her through this, and instead I just set about making her feel worse. Why am I even </i><i><b>thinking</b></i><i> about what I should do here?</i></p><p class="double">Tristan got up from his chair, and picked up one of the pieces of paper from the table.</p><p class="double"><i>Now what on earth do I get instead of daffodils? I’m pretty sure people can’t eat those...</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A knock on the door brought Nyx out of her stupor. She heard Tristan talking with someone at the door, before someone was walking over.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hey Nyx. Didn’t realise you were still awake.” Tristan said, as he placed something on the overbed table. “I got you something to eat.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked down a little.”I...I’m not hungry...”</p><p class="double">“Not even for celery soup?”</p><p class="double">Nyx’s head snapped up towards Tristan’s voice, as her eyes widened. “Did you say...”</p><p class="double">“Yep. Sorry, but I’m pretty sure daffodils are pretty bad for us though, so I got you grilled cheese instead. I remember I used to have them with soup when I was a kid.”</p><p class="double">“Why,” Nyx asked, biting her lip. “Why did you do this?”</p><p class="double">Tristan sat in his chair. “You told me your story, and I said I needed to think about how I felt. I’ll admit, I took longer than I should...” Tristain laughed sheepishly, before sighing. “You had a bad deal in your baseline Nyx. One you didn’t deserve. And now you’re stuck here without Twilight. I’m here to look after you for her. I can’t be her, but I can at least do this.”</p><p class="double">Nyx’s lip quivered, as she held her arms open. Tristan hugged the crying girl.</p><p class="double">“Thank you...” She whispered in his ear.</p><p class="double">“No problem...” he replied, as he broke the embrace. He sat back in his chair.</p><p class="double">“Umm...” Nyx’s voice was small, as she waved her arms slowly in front of her. “Could you... move the table closer?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, sure.” Tristan moved the table a little closer, as a beeping noise came from the laptop behind him. “Huh? What’s going on... OH! The duels must be starting!” Tristan, took a few quick steps toward the laptop, and began sorting through pop-ups and windows. “Hmm...Well, it looks like Yugi’s up first,” Tristain said, as he finally opened up the stream. “Not really surprising, but it’ll give us a chance to fix any issues with the set-up before Twilight’s first match.”</p><p class="double">Tristan turned up the volume, and put the video to full screen. However, it didn’t take long to notice there was a problem.</p><p class="double">“Has it started yet?” Nyx asked, unable to see the video.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, sound isn’t coming through. Give me a sec.”</p><p class="double">Tristan started to fiddle with a few options, before the sound from the stream finally came through the speakers.</p><p class="double">“<i>Exodia, Obliterate!</i>” Yami’s voice was closely followed by a low, guttural roar.</p><p class="double">“What’s going on?” Nyx asked, inching away from the sound. “What’s making that noise?”</p><p class="double">“It’s the monster Yami’s using.” Tristain watched as a bright light enveloped Weevil’s monster, and the counter in the corner of the screen plummeted to 0. “Or was, at least... jeez, Yami’s pretty scary when he gets into it...”</p><p class="double">“It’s over already?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, sorting the sound out took longer than I wanted, and that duel was pretty short... Still, at least everything should work fine next time.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It took less than half an hour for the alert to sound again.</p><p class="double">“Hey, looks like Twilight’s about to have her first duel.”</p><p class="double">Nyx froze as Twilight’s voice drifted through the speakers. “<i>Applejack?”</i></p><p class="double">“What!?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Umm... Yami? </i>Yugi’s voice echoed in the pair’s mind.</p><p class="double"><i>Yes, Yugi?</i></p><p class="double"><i>That card doesn’t normally look like that, does it?</i></p><p class="double"><i>No. No it doesn’t...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Could it be this Applejack Twilight’s talking about?</i></p><p class="double"><i>No, Yugi. The holograms do not have a soul.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Ha ha Yami </i>Yugi deadpanned. <i>You know that’s not what I mean...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Oh... That...</i>Yami paused. <i>I’m afraid I’m not sure. But given how Twilight’s taking this, I hope not. For both their sakes...</i></p><p class="double">Yugi opened his eyes, and turned his attention back to the duel. He walked over to Twilight’s podium. “Josie, it’s not her.”</p><p class="double">“But it looks just...”</p><p class="double">“I know. It’s more complicated than I can say, but we don’t have time. For now, just trust me. It’s not her.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked between the all-too-familiar humanised Applejack on the field, and Yugi. She sighed, before collecting her cards. “I hope you’re right.”</p><p class="double">She turned back to her opponent. She faked a sheepish smile. “Sorry, first time using one of these, wasn’t expecting that...”</p><p class="double">“Well, you better adjust quick. I’m not going to take it easy on you just because you’re new.”</p><p class="double">“You’d better not,” Twilight looked back over her hand, as she tried to remember what her plan had been. “Now, as I was saying, I place one card face down,” she said, as she placed her mirror force onto the field. “I guess that will do for now.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, my turn.” Mike drew a card from his deck, and looked over his hand, a smile on his face. “Well, it’s my lucky day. I place two cards face down,” he said, as two of the slots on his field became filled with a dull light. “And I summon my Harpie’s Elder Brother in Attack mode,” A winged man appeared opposite Twilight’s only creature. “Did I mention, he gains an attack and defence boost, thanks to the mountains in our field?” Twilight watched as the new monster grew in size. “Your turn.”</p><p class="double"><i>Even with that boost, it only has 1980 Attack points? Why summon such a weak monster? </i>Twilight thought as she moved to draw her card. <i>He must have a trap lined up.</i> <i>Well, I can easily avoid that...</i></p><p class="double">“First, before I draw a card, my Fortune Lady Earth gains an extra 400 attack and defence points. That also means you take 400 points of Life Point damage.” Twilight said, watching his counter tick down to 1600, before drawing her card. “Next, I summon my Magician Valkyria in attack mode. That ends my turn.”</p><p class="double">“Scared to attack me directly, little girl?” Mike asked, as he pulled a card from his deck. “I can’t say I’m surprised. I activate my Cyber Shield,” one of the squares of light vanished, as Mike’s monster became encased in a strange suit of armour, and its attack points rose. “Now, you gave me something nice for target practice. It would be a shame to waste it. Harpie’s Brother, take out that Valkyria thing.”</p><p class="double">“Not so fast!” Twilight said, as she flipped over her face down card. “I activate my mirror force, sending that right back at you.”</p><p class="double"><i>Don’t party just yet. If that’s meant ta be Mai, an’ I think it is, then trust me, he has a plan...</i></p><p class="double">“Alright, seriously!” Twilight said, looking around. “Who just said that?”</p><p class="double">“Josie...” Yugi looked worried as he spoke. “No-one said anything...”</p><p class="double">Mike grimaced, before muttering “Figures I’d pick the crazy one to duel...” He shook his head, before flipping over his second face down card. “Either way, I activate my Negate Attack trap, to stop my Harpie Brother’s attack before it even started.”</p><p class="double"><i>Told ya he’d have a plan... </i>The voice retorted.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a breath, and thought. <i>Ok, so whoever this is knows how to duel, speaks in something like a Brooklyn accent... </i>Twilight screwed up her face as the realisation hit her. <i>Oh great. I think I’ve got the person who I’ve replaced in my head... This is just fantastic... Alright Twilight, focus on the duel first. Worry about the voices in your head later, they’ll wait.</i></p><p class="double">She turned back to the field to see that there was once again another square of light in Mike’s magic and trap zone. He was tapping his fingers on his podium. “You can go anytime now...”</p><p class="double">“Okay, my Fortune Lady’s strength increases again, dealing 400 points of damage to your Life Points again.” Twilight said before drawing another card. “And now, I summon my Fortune Lady Wind.”</p><p class="double">Once the summoning light had faded, everyone involved was staring at the field.</p><p class="double">Tea was the first to speak. “Yugi, that card isn’t meant to have rainbow hair, is it?”</p><p class="double">Yugi shook his head. “No, it isn’t. But I think I can guess what’s happened...” he said, before a thought struck him. <i>Six Fortune Ladies. Six friends. All things considered, I probably shouldn’t be all that surprised...</i></p><p class="double">“Oh, good.” Tea said. “I was worried it was just me seeing things or something.”</p><p class="double">Twilight, being the only one to expect something like this, only took a couple of seconds to recover. “Now, when I normal summon her to the field, I can destroy one magic or trap card for every Fortune Lady I have on the field. So, kiss that armor and your face down card goodbye,” Twilight smiled as the armor shattered around the monster, and the light faded from the field. “And then, my Fortune Lady Earth will deal with your monster, and the rest of your Life Points.” Twilight smiled as the Applejack lookalike raised her staff. An orange orb of magic flew towards the monster opposite her, and disintegrated the monster. As Mike’s Life Counter hit zero, the holograms faded.</p><p class="double">Mike looked shocked at the carnage that had occurred. “Three turns...” He tried to gather his cards together, but kept dropping them, his hands shaking. “How... How did you beat me so fast?”</p><p class="double">“You didn’t think I stood a chance.” Twilight said, only realising what she was saying half way through. “There’s faith in your deck, and there’s arrogance. I think you need to take a day and see if you can remember the difference. You’re not out of the tournament yet...” Twilight said, as she collected her prize. She climbed down to the others as Mike walked off, lost in thought.</p><p class="double">“Yugi, we need to talk. Away from any prying eyes...” Twilight said as quietly as she could.</p><p class="double">Yugi nodded. He looked around, and waited until everyone was looking away. A few seconds later the trio had disappeared into the forest.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tristan watched the black screen in shock. <i>I know Yugi likes to give the guests an easy time, but damn. That was insane...</i></p><p class="double">“Wow, momma is really good at this duelling thing, huh?”</p><p class="double">“You said it, Nyx...” Tristan said, as he closed the stream again. “You said it...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After five minutes walking, Tea, Yugi and Twilight stopped walking. “Alright, I don’t think anyone would follow us this far in. What’s bothering you, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“I... think Joey’s in my head...” Twilight said, waiting for the others reactions. “I keep hearing things. In a Brooklyn accent...”</p><p class="double">“Can you remember any of it?” Yugi asked. “We know him better, if it’s him, we’ll know.”</p><p class="double">“Well, before the duel started, the voice said ‘Well, at least he ain’t pullin’ Mai’s two-bit psychic bull...’.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that sounds like Joey.” Tea said, sighing. “What do we do, Yugi?”</p><p class="double">“Can you communicate with him?”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know, I haven’t tried...” Twilight said, before thinking <i>Can you hear me, Joey?</i></p><p class="double">After a minute with no response, Twilight shook her head. “Either he isn’t listening, isn’t answering, is pulling some sort of prank, or he can’t hear me.”</p><p class="double">“Alright. I’m not sure what we can do right now, other than carry on. But we definitely need to look into this at some point. This more than just the odd random comment...” Yugi took a deep breath. “By the way, Twilight. There’s something else we need to talk about...”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Yugi?”</p><p class="double">“Remember how I said those holograms aren’t your friends?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. Although you said it’s complicated...”</p><p class="double">“Like I said, there’s a part of my loop – it doesn’t happen every time – but it’s possible your friends may Awaken during that time. It’s not certain, and even then, we try to just completely shortcut that part, but...”</p><p class="double">“They might be around for that...” Twilight completed the thought, and gulped as she realised what he was saying. “How does that even work?”</p><p class="double">“I’m not entirely sure...”</p><p class="double">“Have you ever awoken as a card before?”</p><p class="double">“No, I ha...” Yugi started, but Twilight cut him off with her next question before he could answer.</p><p class="double">“What’s it like Awakening as a card? Do you only exist for duels? Are you fully aware? Or is it more like a sense of Paralysis until you’re played?”</p><p class="double">“I don’t kno...”</p><p class="double">“What happens if you get destroyed?”</p><p class="double">“Twil...”</p><p class="double">“What happens if you’re removed from the game?”</p><p class="double">“Twilight...” Yugi tried to speak more forcefully, but the result was no different.</p><p class="double">She gasped before her final question. “What happens if someone destroys the card? Do you just go to another copy? Or is your Loop over? And what about Monster Reb...”</p><p class="double">Yugi grabbed the foreign anchor’s shoulders, and gave her a gentle shake, breaking her concentration. “Twilight! I don’t know!” Once it was clear he had her attention, he lowered his voice, and let her go again. “I’ve never looped in like that. They don’t loop in often, and the how and why varies from Loop to Loop. But from what I remember, sometimes they just go to the card graveyard. Sometimes they’re just aware while they’re in play. Sometimes they can project themselves out from the cards, like spirits. And sometimes, the first time the card leaves play, the Looper is gone for the rest of the loop. I can’t say what this Loop has in store, but you have to ask yourself: Do you really want to take that risk?”</p><p class="double">Twilight gulped, before taking six cards out of her deck. She looked at them, but at one in particular.</p><p class="double">Fortune Lady Light. She hadn’t really thought of the cards effect. And then what that would mean. <i>No...</i></p><p class="double">“If it comes to that, I’ll take them out of my deck for a while. I’m not going to risk them like that.”</p><p class="double">Yugi nodded. After a few minutes, he checked his watch “I think we should probably start heading out toward the docks. There’s something we might need to cut off. Pegasus <i>seems</i> nice this time, but that doesn’t always mean anything.”</p><p class="double">Twilight slid the cards back into her deck. “Lead the way...” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.4 (fractalman)</p><p class="double">So far, things had been baseline. The letter from Celestia, the meetings with the other bearers, the night-long party.</p><p class="double">Things diverged when Celestia walked onto the stage. Many long millennia allowed Twilight to discern the subtle eye twitch that was Celestia’s equivalent of nervously looking over her shoulder.</p><p class="double">Celestia gave a quick speech, lit her horn to raise the sun-</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m walking on sunshine, wooah</p><p>I&#039;m walking on sunshine, woooah</p><p>I&#039;m walking on sunshine, woooah</p><p>and don&#039;t it feel good!!”</p><p class="double">Celestia simply closed her eyes and sighed while a filly-sized Luna danced around on her back. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.5 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double">Zidane sat down on the gagged and bound Kuja. &quot;Like I said, easy as pie to cut this one short.&quot; He regarded his fellow looper with a twinge of sadness. &quot;The only sad part is, you may be Garnet, but you&#039;re not Dagger. No half-year honeymoon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora shrugged. &quot;What now, then? To this world I have not been.&quot;</p><p class="double">The monkey-like boy thought for a moment. &quot;Go track down Sir Fratley and restore his memories, I guess. Wait. In the rush and noise, I didn&#039;t quite catch your name. Did you say you were... Why Not Sprinkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora blinked. &quot;Zecora is my name. But you I do not blame: I mentioned Twilight Sparkle&#039;s moniker, for she is my anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zidane thought for a moment. &quot;Twilight Sparkle? And Zecora? Where have I heard those before... Aha!&quot; he pulled a fist-sized crystal from his pocket and tossed it her way. &quot;Here. I yoinked them from Bartz while he wasn&#039;t looking, at the end of the loop. Not quite the thief I am.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora caught it in her air racket, and fished it out. It felt odd, and familiar. She couldn&#039;t get a magical response from it, though - certainly nothing that would indicate herself. She offered him only a quizzical eye.</p><p class="double">He taunted, &quot;You can&#039;t even attune to the one named after you? Someone hasn&#039;t been chosen by the crystals!&quot; He held up a different crystal, cleared his throat and declared, &quot;Spirits of the ponies that reside in the crystals: Twilight Sparkle.&quot; After a moment, he added, &quot;Normally in that loop, you&#039;d expect to get &#039;heroes&#039; instead of &#039;ponies&#039;, and Time Mage instead of Twilight Sparkle. Yours, there? Usually it&#039;s &#039;Chemist&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You used the powers of me and my friends - for your own ends?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Naw, it was mechanically identical to the originals, but the costumes...&quot; He focused on one, and his clothing changed into a very good anthro-Rainbow Dash cosplay. &quot;Guess what the Dragoon was called.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;With the hair colors all a-splash, that must be Rainbow Dash.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zidane grinned. &quot;You&#039;ve got dedication to that rhyming thing. I like it. Anyway, I really liked the visual effect upgrade on the Jump attack. Big rainbow explosion thing, not just jump... land.&quot;</p><p class="double">A clomp-clomp-clomp of footsteps became audible from the stairwell. Zidane sighed. &quot;Well, looks like time&#039;s up. Here comes Steiner, and...&quot; He leaned out over the railing. &quot;Hey, rustbucket! You awake?&quot;</p><p class="double">From there, it was a chase scene. A chase scene between two fit loopers carrying a captive megalomaniac, and one unawake overweight man in heavy armor. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.6 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Twilight read it again, but it hadn&#039;t changed.</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Twilight,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Burn things.</i></p><p class="double">The scroll had appeared in the usual manner, but clearly this wasn&#039;t Princess Celestia&#039;s writing. <i>Does someone think I&#039;m that gullible?</i> Twilight thought. <i>Or maybe brain-damaged for the sake of a cheap gag?</i></p><p class="double">Taking up a fresh scroll and quill, she composed a quick response:</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your orders have been received and shall be carried out immediately. I hereby enclose the original orders so you will be reminded of the strict letter of your orders, should there be complaints.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Princess Twilight Sparkle</i></p><p class="double">She then proceeded out into the Ponyville streets, looking around for her first victim.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash. Perfect.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Rainbow Dash!&quot; she shouted. &quot;I just want to say that everything I&#039;m about to do is by order of Princess Celestia, so complain to her, all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh? Twilight, what are you talking about?&quot; Dash stared down at the purple alicorn, face wrinkled in confusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem.&quot; Twilight held a hoof to her chest and declaimed, &quot;Rainbow Dash, you are so slow that Hearth&#039;s Warming gets to the finish line before you do. I wouldn&#039;t say you&#039;re as thick as molasses, because you can water down molasses. Lessee... oh, yeah,&quot; Twilight added, &quot;and geologists had to invent a level 11 on the Hay-Mows hardness scale for your head.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s jaw dropped. Then it rose again, because your jaw can&#039;t drop while your teeth are grinding. After several seconds of very tense silence, the pegasus said, &quot;And Celestia ordered you to say that, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Direct orders, sent just minutes ago,&quot; Twilight nodded innocently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Dash said. &quot;I think I&#039;ll just pay Canterlot a visit. See you later!&quot; The sonic rainboom seemed a bit fiercer than usual, this time.</p><p class="double"><i>Right, who&#039;s next? Not Pinkie: one-fifth chance she breaks down in tears, four-fifths she treats it as a game and answers back, zero chance she annoys Celestia. Fluttershy... no, because that&#039;s just cruel. There goes Scootaloo... no, that&#039;s cruel with whipped cream and a cherry on top. Oh wait... there&#039;s Vinyl Scratch. If I play this right I might actually be able to double the burns. Huzzah!</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A couple of hours later, back in the library, Twilight received another scroll, this time in slightly better hoofwriting that still wasn&#039;t Celestia&#039;s. And was in crayon.</p><p class="double"><i>Twilight Snarkle,</i></p><p class="double"><i>I think you misunderstood, hardee har har, misunderstood my left flank. I ordered you to burn things, that is set things on fire. </i><u><i>No metaphors.</i><i> As a princess you should know the extreme importance of everything going up in towering columns of smoke and fire, fire, huh huh, huhuhuh, huhuhuh, nacho supreme. </i></u></p><p class="double"><i>Here&#039;s a lighter. Get to it.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Princess Celestia</i></p><p class="double"><i>P. S. tell your friends to </i><u><i>cut it out</i><i> with the complaints.</i></u></p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the butane lighter in her hoof and nodded. <i>Whoever this is, they really do think I&#039;m an idiot. Well... challenge accepted.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed this is not my sister&#039;s writing,&quot; Luna agreed. &quot;But I am a bit surprised you went along with this farce.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was bored,&quot; Twilight admitted. &quot;Besides, I only picked things that would be difficult to set on fire. A village full of thatched-roof homes and tents isn&#039;t a challenge at all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Cloud Kicker&#039;s house in Cloudsdale? The grass around the Stalliongrad train station, while it was still under a foot of snow? An entire river??&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That last one was not me,&quot; Twilight protested. &quot;The Cuyahorsea River self-ignites about every other spring.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I must speak with my sister about the pollution caused by industry these days,&quot; Luna sighed. &quot;But I was referring to the River Canter.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, <i>that</i> river,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Yeah, that was me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I still fail to see the point of this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To enjoy myself while making sure the idiot who thought this up DOESN&#039;T enjoy himself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you certainly succeeded there, Ms. Weisenheimer Princess.&quot; Discord appeared out of nowhere, wearing a fake alicorn horn and a most unconvincing Celestia wig. &quot;Here I was, expecting princess-powered chaos, and all you do is subvert my plans with pointless acts of nonsense.&quot; With a voice so whiny it had vintage and bouquet he added, &quot;That&#039;s MY line of business, I&#039;ll have you know!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you for that confession,&quot; Twilight smiled. &quot;Now that I know it was you, I can apply the appropriate karmic retribution.&quot; With a flash of her magic, she caused a giant ice sculpture of a large butane lighter to appear, complete with the logo of a very popular Hub world auto manufacturer embossed on the side.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t get it,&quot; Discord said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yes you do,&quot; Twilight said, picking up the giant sculpture in her magic and flicking the striker. A giant flame of carved ice leapt from the wick, engulfing Discord. When Twilight flipped the ice lighter closed, nothing remained but some ashes and a pair of googly red-irised eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is no way to treat a reformed lord of chaos,&quot; Discord muttered. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;Keep your eyes closed!&quot; Indiana Jones shouted. &quot;Whatever you do, do NOT look inside the Ark! No matter what happens, DON&#039;T LOOK!&quot;</p><p class="double">As he clenched his eyes shut, and hoped Marion did the same- sometimes she didn&#039;t, and that was always a bad Loop- Indy tried to piece together exactly where he&#039;d failed to derail this chain of events. He&#039;d Awakened early enough to discredit Belloq when that disgrace to the name of France attempted to plagiarize his thesis... and yet he&#039;d managed to get the Nazis on his side, no big surprise there. He&#039;d tried to keep the relationship with Marion viable, but he just couldn&#039;t prevent sparks from flying when the two got together, so of course he was half a world away when her father died. He&#039;d gone straight from Nepal to Egypt, getting a full day&#039;s jump on the baseline, and still the Nazis managed to take the Ark. He&#039;d even foregone stowing away on the U-boat, instead stealing a fishing boat and following the Nazis to that damn island so he could pick up the Ark after its spirits had finished with them... only to be captured as soon as the dinghy touched ground on the beach.</p><p class="double">So here they were again, tied to the stake, closing their eyes against the horror to come, wishing they could close their ears as well.</p><p class="double">He heard the Nazis and Belloq gasping in wonder at something. Probably the angels, or whatever, making their appearance. (He&#039;d watched precisely once. One angel had floated up to him, its face twisted in confusion. Then it hung its head and shook it sadly... and Jones&#039; memory blessedly failed at that point, except to note that it took very little time for the Loop to reset after that experiment.)</p><p class="double">The gasps of wonder turned to grunts of confusion. &quot;Vas ist los?&quot;</p><p class="double">The valley echoed with the trumpet of... a party blower?</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi! Welcome to the ULTIMATE party experience!&quot; The voice was female, girlish, and chipper enough to render a century-old pine tree to kindling in seconds. &quot;I&#039;m so glad ALL of you are here for this!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indy, is that-&quot; Marion asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;EYES SHUT!&quot; Jones gasped, having to fight the overwhelming urge to peek himself.</p><p class="double">&quot;By the way, I should point out...&quot; The perky voice took on an even sharper edge. &quot;By &#039;ultimate&#039; I mean the original definition of the word. Here comes the cake... but the candles blow YOU out...&quot;</p><p class="double">In later Loops Indy would thank any and all listening Gods that his memory edited out the sounds of the several minutes that happened after that. The only fragment of recollection he retained was the horrible sensation of overwhelming curiosity and anti-curiosity at war within him; never before had he both wanted to know, and NOT wanted to know, so desperately.</p><p class="double">When the sounds of horrible merriment ended with the booming slam of the Ark&#039;s lid, he heard the sound of hooves approaching over the rocky ground. &quot;You can open your eyes now,&quot; the voice said. &quot;I&#039;m only a temp worker. Not really official. But don&#039;t ask any questions, or I&#039;ll have to send you to the party.&quot;</p><p class="double">Indy&#039;s eyes opened... and there, standing before him, was a pink pony thing with a large pair of shears held between its forehooves. It stared up at him with huge blue eyes.</p><p class="double"><i>I knew the Loops would drive me mad</i>, he thought, <i>and today is the day.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Hold still,&quot; the pink pony said. A few seconds later the ropes around them were gone, and Indy and Marion fell away from the stake. A moment later they were in each other&#039;s arms.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okie dokie, my work here is done,&quot; the pony said, grinning. &quot;I&#039;ll see you in Hatay State in a couple years, Indy...&quot; Struck by a thought, the pony froze and added, &quot;Oh yeah! Be reeeeeal sure to remember- in Latin the name &#039;Jehovah&#039; is spelled with an &#039;I&#039;!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... yeah... right...&quot; Indy and Marion watched as the pony walked up the crest of a hill and vanished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Indy,&quot; Marion gasped, &quot;what was-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NO QUESTIONS!&quot; the chipper voice echoed through the valley.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think we should just get the Ark off this island as quickly as possible,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Before anything else happens.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A great many Loops later, Indy Awoke in a cottage in the far northwest of Equestria. His hooves hovered above a typewriter- <i>how does that WORK</i>, Indy wondered? On the paper in the roller read the words: <u><i>Equestria Jones and the Sapphire Stone</i><i>, by Hairy Withers.</i></u></p><p class="double">He ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Pony. Check.</p><p class="double">He ran to the closet and opened it up. Khaki shirts, workable. Pith helmets... <i>feh. I hate pith helmets.</i></p><p class="double">And on a hook behind the front door... a bullwhip.</p><p class="double">Without thinking about it, Indy reached a hoof up, took down the bullwhip, and gave it an experimental crack. It felt right.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; he said aloud, as Loop memories began to filter through his consciousness. &quot;I wonder if this is where-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NO QUESTIONS!&quot;</p><p class="double">Indy looked out the window. Another pony, pink with a poofy mane, looked through the window. It pointed one hoof to its own blue eyes, then directly at Indy in the standard I&#039;m-watching-you gesture. Then she sank slowly out of sight below the level of the windowsill.</p><p class="double">Indy spent half an hour looking for the pink pony, or any hoofprints from same, before giving up and pulling out the very secret bottle of hard cider his pre-Awake self kept in the bottom drawer of the writing desk. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.8 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hey, Twilight!&quot; Rainbow Dash exclaimed as her friend entered her hospital room.</p><p class="double">The Anchor chuckled ruefully. &quot;Still don&#039;t have the hang of chiropteran wings, hm?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Kie-rop... ?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Bat wings. I <i>do</i> try to find out quickly what the proper term is in Loops where Luna&#039;s Night Guard <i>aren&#039;t</i> using disguise magic, you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, heh, right.&quot; Dash blushed and wiggled her good wing; her injured one was immobilized by the cast. &quot;Anyway, since this is supposed to be somewhat baseline, what have you got for me this time around? I love Daring Do and all, and A. K. Yearling is almost as awesome as me, but . . . I&#039;ve read them all.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight levitated some obviously rebound Hub Loop paperbacks. &quot;Well, I got copies of some of the baselines of other worlds that Sleipnir administrates. I was going to offer you <i>The Heavenly Horse from the Outermost West</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow twisted her lips into a <i>moue</i> of disgust that Twilight thought looked adorable with the little fangs. &quot;Isn&#039;t that one of the saddle rippers Rarity was reading a couple loops ago?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. &quot;That Loop had an unawake version of the Hub author of these books. That version is a pretty good romance, but this is epic fantasy instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, who knows?&quot; Dash mused. &quot;I might Wake up as the protagonist one of these Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Or the love interest,&quot; Twilight teased.</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought we weren&#039;t mentioning the shotgun wedding Loop ever again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah,&quot; Twilight said, kissing Dash&#039;s cheek. &quot;It&#039;s too much fun teasing you, &#039;Blitz.&#039;&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.9 (DrTempo)</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer, as she tended to do when she was on summer vacation in the other world, was relaxing in Ponyville. Rarity sat down next to Sunset, and after a few minutes, Rarity asked, &quot;Sunset?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are you so...how do I say this...prone to fighting?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset chuckled for a second, replying &quot;Twilight asked me that when she finished reading my journal.&quot; Taking a sip of her drink, she then said, &quot;I suppose it&#039;s due to that journey. I had to fight more often than not, and I&#039;m good at it. Trust me, I know you&#039;d kick my flank easily if I went nuts, Rarity. But I&#039;ve had to experience many cases in my early Loops where fighting was the only option.&quot;</p><p class="double">After taking a sip of her dink, Sunset continued, &quot;Don&#039;t worry, Rarity. I haven&#039;t lost the values of friendship everypony here in Equestria holds dear. But I know from experience that sometimes, you have to fight to protect what you cherish most. And if I have to bear the burden, I&#039;ll do what it takes to do so. I don&#039;t have the skill to settle things without battle like most of you can just yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled, replying, &quot;And I thought you could be a brute when I first met you after you Awoke.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset sighed. &quot;You punch out a giant red dragon&#039;s lights one time, and you never hear the end of it....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;...soooooo,&quot; Nyx started as she glanced up at nothing. &quot;Quick question. Did Fluttershy, yano, kinda take you aside to discuss... things?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lemon Rush sighed. &quot;Yes, yes she did. And my wolfpack did too. And the Emperor, when he got wind of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Nyx coughed. &quot;Did... any of them have, um... charts?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ha! No. Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">They walked together in silence.</p><p class="double">&quot;...and,&quot; Nyx added with a blush, &quot;diagrams.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...what.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For both ponies and humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>What.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mostly regarding proper dating etiquette.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lemon opened his mouth, paused, and nodded. &quot;Oh, alright, that makes sense.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.11 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">The bearers of the Elements of Harmony all dearly loved Twilight Sparkle, but when they arrived at the library and saw her armed with a slide projector, chalkboard and pointer, they knew exactly what to expect. Rainbow Dash, believing in being prepared, had brought a cloud for a pillow.</p><p class="double">Twilight glared at the pillow, but decided not to mention it. &quot;I have made an important discovery,&quot; she said instead. &quot;This is not, as we previously thought, a baseline Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The others exchanged glances, and Rarity found herself silently nominated spokespony. &quot;What makes you say that, darling?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve spent most of my free time this Loop observing the motions of an unAwake Derpy Hooves,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Normally Derpy&#039;s movement is either direct and competent-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not often enough,&quot; Rainbow Dash muttered, keeping her head planted firmly on her cloud.</p><p class="double">&quot;- or so random that it comes close to genuine Brownian motion,&quot; Twilight pressed on. &quot;But this Loop is different. All observations of Derpy in flight show a common trend, which I have recently identified through careful mathematics. In fact, Derpy is traveling in straight lines. However, these lines appear to us to be corkscrews and spirals due to conditions which Derpy is unable to observe.&quot; Raising her voice slightly to cover Rainbow Dash&#039;s snoring, she finished, &quot;Specifically, a rotating frame of reference.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rotating frame of reference?&quot; Fluttershy asked. &quot;Does that mean-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You can&#039;t be saying-&quot; Rarity interjected.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I do. I am.&quot; Twilight flipped the chalkboard to show a diagram of stars and planets swirling around a single pegasus. &quot;It seems that this Loop, the universe literally revolves around Derpy Hooves.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.12 (Zetrein and FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double">The scene opened, looking at a picturesque view of the Ponyville Library. A suave male voiceover began.</p><p class="double">&quot;Causality got you down?&quot; The Library disappeared in a titanic explosion, wood shrapnel pelting the camera before the scene changed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wish you could know just what the next disaster will be?&quot; Discord stood before a pristine Library, wearing a top hat and cape, twirling his mustache. With a snap of his claws, it was reduced to a pile of cheese.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe you just want to know if aliens are real?&quot; The scene was now a wide angle aerial shot of Ponyville. A giant black cuttlefish flew into view, blasting a ridiculously loud fog horn, before sweeping a red beam of energy through town, striking the Library.</p><p class="double">The camera changed to a purple mare, sitting at a wooden market stall. &quot;Well wonder no more! Twilight Sparkle&#039;s Temporal Advice Service is here to help!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled at the camera. &quot;Time&#039;s broken, ask me anything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Disclaimer: Twilight Sparkle is not Omniscient, she is a Timetraveller.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom looked from the holoprojector to the beaming unicorn and back again. She essayed a nervous smile. &quot;Well, it&#039;s a real good commercial, Twilight, but we ain&#039;t got TV most o&#039; th&#039; time.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;Exactly! Which is why I wanted your help getting it up and running.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fer the whole nation.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yup!&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly considered this. She started to voice a few objections, but more came to mind each time she tried. &quot;And what timeframe were ya lookin&#039; at here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, the first few times would probably take the whole Loop, but with practice, I&#039;m sure we could disseminate the technology before I get the Gala tickets.&quot; Twilight smirked. &quot;Besides, I&#039;m sure this isn&#039;t the first time you&#039;ve dragged Equestria up a few rungs of the tech ladder.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom shrugged. &quot;Eh, why not? Not like any of the other Crusaders are Awake right now. Ya wanna start with cathode ray tubes or go straight t&#039; plasma?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">113.13 (TokoWH)</p><p class="double">Twilight stumbled as she attempted to throw the odd plant creature with all the strength she could muster. Having lived for who knew how long and having enough magical power to ascend to alicornhood ten times over, it should have been a simple task... If she could have accessed her powers, that was. Twilight sighed, the plant creature barely landing a few feet away. She had been to safe mode loops where her powers were suppressed, as well as her subspace pocket, but there was one little fact that made this all the more odd...</p><p class="double">&quot;I take it you&#039;re still adjusting?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced over to the sight of a semi-stout man in a yellow space suit, his giant nose barely fitting in his dome shaped space helmet. The oddest part was the single antenna on the top of his helmet that ended in a bright red bulb. It was an odd sight, to be sure, though Twilight wasn&#039;t any less odd thanks to this loops standards.</p><p class="double">She still had her same mane, or hair style, rather, as always, though she was apparently of the same species as the man next to her was. Her nose was slightly smaller than the mans, and her head was a bit less rounded. Her space suit was almost an exact mirror, though the bulb atop her helmet was purple instead of red.</p><p class="double">&quot;Kind of. It&#039;s nothing too new, but...&quot; Twilight said, standing up straight. &quot;I still find this loop really odd. It&#039;s not so much the army of plant creatures that obey the commands of aliens, though that&#039;s pretty weird, don&#039;t get me wrong, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">The man smiled, giving a nod. &quot;Ah, yes. I assume you mean the fact that our world deactivates subspace pockets and any abilities ones wouldn&#039;t have learned pre-awake, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Twilight said, raising an eyebrow. &quot;I don&#039;t get that. I know safe mode loops do something similar, but never to this extent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. Our loop is... odd, to say the least.&quot; The man said, giving a shrug. &quot;The exact way our loop works is a bit... screwy, from what our admin has said. We get fused loops, but usually the loopers are on a completely different planet far away from us, so we rarely run into outside loopers such as yourself.&quot; The man said, crossing his arms as he tilted his head. &quot;On top of that, our presence rarely has an effect on one another&#039;s worlds. From what our admin said, events usually carry out like they do in baseline almost to a T, for both us and the guest loopers.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is weird.&quot; Twilight said, tilting her head. &quot;Any idea on why that is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;From what our admin says, the reason our loop is like it is was because of some sort of event called &#039;The Crash&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seeing Twilight flinch at this, the man shook his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can only assume it wasn&#039;t a pleasant event, that much is for sure. Apparently, our branch of Yggdrasil is rather close to the universe that started the crash, and thus was heavily affected by it. Luckily, it didn&#039;t cause major disruptive damage so much as it knocked a few things loose, hence why our loops, and fused loops with our loop disrupt subspace pockets and suppress abilities not native to the baseline, and general power downs all around.&quot;</p><p class="double">The man shrugged as he finished his explanation, before he noticed one of the plant creatures walk up to him. He gave a soft smile, giving the red being with a sharp, point nose a pat.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know how it goes for outside loopers on other planets, but if it weren&#039;t for the Pikmin here, we likely wouldn&#039;t be able to make it through our loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight had a hand to the part of the dome just under her chin as she listened to the lengthy explanation. &quot;That&#039;s quite the tale, Olimar.&quot; Twilight said, shaking her head. &quot;I can&#039;t imagine what it must be like to go through several loops without a subspace pocket, let alone that being the norm for your loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Olimar turned to Twilight, an amused expression on his face. &quot;It&#039;s a bit disheartening to not have the same abilities that are the norm for everyone else, but we get by.&quot; Olimar said, before he shook his head. &quot;Though, to say we <i>never </i>have access to our subspace pockets is a bit of lie. We <i>can </i>access them once in a great while, as well as non-native abilities, but it&#039;s incredibly rare. Like a &#039;Once in a blue moon&#039; type deal.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Olimar glanced over to a group of Pikmin heading towards one of the cylinder shaped objects that was standing on three yellow legs. Twilight looked at it with blank stare, before glancing over to Olimar.</p><p class="double">&quot;I still find the idea of random beings from other planets touching down on an uncharted planet and taking control of a colony of the native beings a bit unsettling.&quot; Twilight said, before looking back at the Pikmin.</p><p class="double">&quot;From what I understand, a lot of outside loopers do.&quot; Olimar said with a shrug. &quot;I can understand why, but really it&#039;s a symbiotic relationship. The Pikmin can&#039;t survive on their own. They more or less <i>need </i>a leader to guide them.&quot; Olimar said, turning to Twilight. &quot;Every time I&#039;ve touched down on this planet after leaving the last time, the number of Pikmin in the Onions always drops drastically from what it was when I was here last.&quot; He said, turning back to the Pikmin. &quot;Without a leader, the Pikmin become the bottom barrel of the food chain on this planet, easily picked off by predators without being able to properly fight back. It&#039;s a sad fact, but being part plant, it&#039;s likely natural.&quot;</p><p class="double">Olimar chuckled, before turning towards the Red Onion. &quot;I think the Pikmin realize this too. That&#039;s likely why they follow Hocotatians or Koppaites when they&#039;re on the planet. The fact that I&#039;m looping likely confirms this theory.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Twilight said, turning to Olimar with a raised eyebrow. &quot;aren&#039;t you the anchor, though?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what we thought at first.&quot; Olimar said, turning to Twilight. &quot;However, after an alarming number of loops where I was unawake, as well as the fact that Alph, Brittany, and Charlie started looping some time after, even though I&#039;m only barely acquainted with them, we have come to believe one of the Pikmin Onions might be the anchor, the Red Onion being the most likely candidate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Pikmin Onions? What makes you think that?&quot; Twilight asked, crossing her arms.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, for starters, while generally we&#039;re unable to carry stuff with us through the loops thanks to our messed up subspace pockets, the Onions seem to be able to occasionally carry any Pikmin created through the loops over, with the Red Onion being the most frequent offender, so to speak.&quot; Olimar said, glancing over to the Red Onion. &quot;On top of that, the loopers of our world seem to be limited to people who have spent an abnormal amount of time on the Pikmin Planet, with the ones who encountered the Red Onion first, Alph and I, being the first known loopers of our universe.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How odd. I mean, looping artifacts serving as the anchor aren&#039;t unheard of, but still...&quot; Twilight said, turning towards the Red Onion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then again, it might not be an artifact.&quot; Olimar said, placing his hand on the bottom of his helmet. &quot;I&#039;ve always had a theory that the Onions were at least somewhat sentient, and not just the Pikmin&#039;s nest or means of reproduction. Whether or not the Onion being the anchor, or the other Onions occasionally looping proves this theory or not has yet to be seen.&quot;</p><p class="double">A silence fell over the duo as the Pikmin continued to carry pellets back to the Onion. Olimar smiled, before turning to Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;I must say, despite this being your first loop here, you&#039;re performing much better than my usual partner Louie.&quot; Olimar said, glancing over towards the Pikmin. &quot;I knew there were ways to make them collect berries and such without our direct command, but I didn&#039;t know collecting pellets could also be automated.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What can I say. I&#039;m an organized pony... or person, this loop at least.&quot;</p><p class="double">Both loopers shared a hearty chuckle, before Olimar took a deep breath.</p><p class="double">&quot;At this rate, we should have Hocotate Freight&#039;s debt repaid in no time.&quot; Olimar said, though he was quick to breath a sigh. &quot;I just hope the President of Hocotate Freight doesn&#039;t force us to return here after it&#039;s paid off to collect the rest of the treasures. No matter what we do when he&#039;s unawake, he <i>always </i>finds out about the Submerged Castle, and <i>always </i>forces us to go collect the treasure within it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked, tilting her head. &quot;Why? What&#039;s so bad about this &#039;Submerged Castle&#039; place?&quot;</p><p class="double">Olimar took a deep breath, shaking his head before he glanced at Twilight out of the corner of his eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me put it this way. The only times we go there are when the loops forces us to go there.&quot; Olimar said, before he straightened himself up. &quot;Tell me, Twilight... do you believe in Eldritch Abominations?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shivered. All of a sudden, she <i>really </i>didn&#039;t want to see what this &#039;Submerged Castle&#039; was about... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Which record would that be?”</p><p class="double">“Tech uplift. What&#039;s your best?” Twilight paused, then elaborated. “Let&#039;s say... from an arbitrary starting point no later than Hub Napoleonic, to spaceflight. And no Pocket cheats.”</p><p class="double">“Humm.” Applebloom fidgeted with her latest project – she&#039;d been making what she called a nanospanner, which would use Jain-type tech to fix something while apparently just tightening up a bolt. “&#039;bout a year is my best, assumin&#039; you&#039;re goin&#039; from something before steam power. Built somethin&#039; right out of Jules Verne, put all my effort into a big &#039;ol grav-compensator and the mother of all guns. You?”</p><p class="double">“Tool use to spaceflight in four hours.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom dropped her spanner.</p><p class="double">“What.”</p><p class="double">Twilight held her expression for a moment, then laughed. “Okay, yeah, kind of a cheat. I was a Cheela.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom looked blank.</p><p class="double">Twilight put a book down in front of her. “This should explain. Anyway, Cheela think and evolve really fast. To me it was more like five hundred years, basically. But I never specified <i>subjective</i> time, did I?”</p><p class="double">“...yeah, bein&#039; an Anchor just gives you a lot more chances to learn the loopholes, don&#039;t it.” Applebloom retrieved her spanner, put it carefully on the workbench, and then picked up <i>Dragon&#039;s Egg.</i> “Ah&#039;ll just give this a read, then.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy whistled to herself – one of Sweetie&#039;s latest pieces – as she went through the loop-start routine. Feed the animals, grow the plants, teach something new to the birds – she thought <i>Tubular Bells</i> would be nice this time – and make sure Angel Bunny wasn&#039;t too grumpy.</p><p class="double">Around ten in the morning, however, hooves coming up the path interrupted her.</p><p class="double">“Good morning, Fluttershy,” Twilight said pleasantly. “Do you have a few minutes?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy interpreted that easily. <i>Please give me some time with you to cope with my last loop.</p><p class="double"></i>“How could I say no?” she replied, and turned to the parrot. “Please make sure that they keep learning the melodic line.”</p><p class="double">The parrot nodded to her, flaring his wings. “Melodic line! Melodic line!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right.” Fluttershy then headed for her door. Seeing Twilight looking mildly interested, she smiled. “He can pronounce speech, but he doesn&#039;t quite understand what each word means. He can understand me, of course, because...” She indicated herself with a small movement of one wing. “Special talent.”</p><p class="double">“And your Element, of course.” Twilight nodded, and followed her friend into the cottage.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thanks, Fluttershy,” Twilight said, sipping her mint tea. “For remembering I like this, as well.”</p><p class="double">“Not a problem,” Fluttershy assured her. “Now – what was it that happened last loop?”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, and put her mug down. “I&#039;m glad you were Awake,” she said, more or less as a non sequitur. “The other Kindnesses aren&#039;t... <i>quite</i> as appropriate a choice. You see, I was in Lemon&#039;s world.”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Fluttershy smiled. “Did you see him?”</p><p class="double">“No, I was the only one Awake.” Twilight swallowed, and took another sip of tea. “Anyway, it was one of those loops where most of my abilities were locked out.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t like those,” Fluttershy agreed. “I can&#039;t help people as easily.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s usually what I don&#039;t like, either,” Twilight nodded. “There was one time I was a mare in the Hub world, all I had was my brains... anyway, I was basically a standard Eldar farseer. Exodite, if that means anything to you.”</p><p class="double">“Exodite are usually quite pleasant,” Fluttershy mused.</p><p class="double">“That part was,” Twilight replied. “I went around there for a few years, casting about in the future to make sure it was baseline for the Dark Millennium, and then I used the Webway to walk to Earth.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blinked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know, not one of my better ideas.” Twilight took a full mouthful of tea, this time, and savoured it for several long seconds. “I appeared in the Throne Room – mostly empty, which was lucky – and contacted the Emperor.”</p><p class="double">Her audience reacted in two different ways.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy, who had had several conversations with the Emperors of different iterations of the loops – not all pleasant – made a little <i>oh</i> of surprise. “Was that safe?” she queried.</p><p class="double">Angel, who had <i>been</i> the Emperor, shrugged and went back to gnawing on a carrot.</p><p class="double">“Well, I wasn&#039;t sure, but I did future-sight just in case.” Twilight rubbed her forehead with a hoof, and then drank some more tea. “He was quite pleasant. I told him some of the important things which he should know – the Word Bearers were the weak link, but Chaos was coming; the nature of the Necrons; how to build a non-psychotic artificial intelligence – you know, raise it like a child – and all sorts of other things. Over dinner, actually.”</p><p class="double">Twilight winced. “He was charming, witty, erudite, asked searching questions, clearly understood what I was saying, and then as I rose to leave ten members of the Sisterhood of Silence stepped in and captured me.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s breath hissed. “Oh dear,” she said quietly. “You didn&#039;t see them-”</p><p class="double">“-when I future scryed, yes,” Twilight completed. “Because they&#039;re Blanks. And then I spent about the next month and a half being exhaustively interrogated for everything I knew.”</p><p class="double">She swallowed compulsively. “I tried to give it to them, and they didn&#039;t believe it. And then they moved onto the torture.”</p><p class="double">The room was silent for several seconds, with the only sound being a parrot outside squawking “Mandolin! Mandolin!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy stood up from her chair, walked over, and hugged Twilight wordlessly.</p><p class="double">“Thanks, Fluttershy,” Twilight said, her voice hitching slightly. “I... the Emperor&#039;s a very powerful psyker, and he did eventually manage to crack my shields. Possibly that was when they tried the...” She stopped there, swallowed again, and went on gamely. “Anyway, there&#039;s an Eldar technique to suicide. I used it.”</p><p class="double">She sighed, the exhalation going on for a long time.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy?” she asked eventually. “I&#039;m sorry, but – can you handle things today?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Louise de Valliere triggered her summoning spell. This <i>had</i> to work!</p><p class="double">With a bright flash of green light, something very big dropped into the centre of the circle.</p><p class="double">“Well, well,” the teacher said with an interested eyebrow-raise. “It appears, miss Louise, that you&#039;ve summoned a dragon.”</p><p class="double">He frowned. “But I&#039;m not sure what kind...”</p><p class="double"><i>I?</i> The black dragon raised up on his hind legs, flaring his wings. <i>I am the Unholy Offspring of Lightning and Death Itself! I am a Night Fury, the swiftest of all dragons, possessed of a mighty flame that burns even rock! I am-</i> the tone of the silent voice changed from bragging to confused. <i>Okay, you&#039;re not Hiccup. What the Hel&#039;s going on?</i></p><p class="double">“Hi, bud,” one of the other students said, waving from next to a large griffin.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, nope.</i> The dragon took off with a slamming wingbeat, and flew over to the other student – leaving Louise looking rather startled in the summoning circle.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>What&#039;s going on?</i> Toothless repeated. <i>What is going on? Who&#039;s </i>that?</p><p class="double">Hiccup nodded to the griffin, who rolled upright.</p><p class="double">Tail lashing, the griffin crunched her foreclaws together with a <i>clack</i> sound. “<i>She</i>, you right pillock, is Gilda the Griffin.”</p><p class="double">Toothless looked Gilda up and down. <i>Oh, yeah, I remember you – the shouty one.</i> This earned a snigger from Hiccup and a look from Gilda.<i> How&#039;s Equestria?</i></p><p class="double">“Could be worse.” Gilda shrugged, then punched Toothless in the shoulder. “You&#039;re all right, dragon. Now, what was the big deal?”</p><p class="double"><i>Well...</i> Toothless twitched his wings in a shrug. <i>Hiccup is sorta mine. I&#039;ve been here before, it&#039;s just... you&#039;re kind of in my slot.</i></p><p class="double">Gilda tapped her beak. “Right, right.” (By now, most of the students had gotten over their shock at a talking dragon and a talking griffin, and were actually listening to what they were <i>saying</i>.) “Tell you what. Swap?”</p><p class="double"><i>Fine by me.</i></p><p class="double">Toothless strutted over to lie down behind Hiccup, neatly taking the place Gilda had vacated.</p><p class="double">Gilda, for her part, fluttered over to land in the summoning ring. “Right,” she said, pointing at Louise. “You&#039;re with me now. You pass the coffee, I beat stuff up.”</p><p class="double">Louise looked helplessly at Colbert, who pursed his lips. “It&#039;s very irregular... has the summoning contract been completed yet?”</p><p class="double">“Just did it with Toothless!” Hiccup called. “Gilda never got bonded.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Gilda agreed. “Okay, how do we do this?”</p><p class="double">“Bonding is sealed with a kiss,” Colbert said automatically.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not into bipeds,” Gilda replied near-instantly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee looked down at the four fillies. “Okay, what have you gotten up to now?”</p><p class="double">“We have seen the truth,” Diamond Tiara announced solemnly. “She has come.”</p><p class="double">“Her vessel was ready,” Applebloom added, in similar tones. “Prepared from birth.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle began chanting solemnly. <i>“Pie iesu domine, dona eis requiem...”</p><p class="double"></i>Cheerilee had to hide a smile, recognizing the cadence. “Have you been summoning chaos lords again?” she asked sternly.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Applebloom blushed, rubbing the back of her neck. “Not <i>exactly.</i>..”</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon peeked her mismatched head out from behind a curtain. “Can I come out now?”</p><p class="double">“No, not yet,” Tiara said, then sighed. “Oh, whatever. Too late now.”</p><p class="double">Silver floated into the main area of the classroom, shrugging. “You&#039;re honestly lucky that I waited long enough to get to the chant.” She landed between Scootaloo and Sweetie, and curled her fluffy tail up around her hind legs.</p><p class="double">Applebloom was giving the teacher a look. “You seem awfully calm about this, Miss Cheerilee.”</p><p class="double">“Why wouldn&#039;t I be?” Cheerilee asked, confused.</p><p class="double">“...oh, fer...” Applebloom kicked a table leg. “She&#039;s Awake, girls. Waste of a setup.”</p><p class="double">There was general disappointment.</p><p class="double">“I could pretend not to be?” Cheerilee suggested.</p><p class="double">“Nah, &#039;s ruined now.”</p><p class="double">Silver gave her a smile. “Nice thought, though.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Excellent work, Diamond!” Rarity gushed, as the latest satisfied customer left the shop. “Simply superb!”</p><p class="double">She extended her smile to include Zecora. “And, of course, your help was invaluable as well.”</p><p class="double">Zecora nodded politely. “If I might just be so bold – it was nothing, truth be told.”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. “Of course it was, darling. And I&#039;m glad that both of you have absorbed the true message of what I was trying to teach you.”</p><p class="double">Blank stares from the other two Generosity-bearers.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear...” Rarity sighed. “I must have been far too subtle.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;d be a first,” Tiara quipped.</p><p class="double">At a stern look from Rarity, she held up a hoof. “Pax, pax! It&#039;s the effect of hanging around the other Crusaders, really. I can&#039;t pass up a good setup line.”</p><p class="double">“From what I recall, that&#039;s not changed at all,” Zecora pointed out.</p><p class="double">“As I was saying,” Rarity said firmly, bringing them back to the first topic. “You&#039;ve both heard me sing that heartsong, <i>Art of the Dress</i>. But can either of you tell me what the <i>true</i> Art of the Dress is?”</p><p class="double">Zebra exchanged a look with earth pony filly.</p><p class="double">“Nope,” Diamond said for both of them.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Rarity took a deep breath, and favoured them both with a smile.</p><p class="double">“The <i>true</i> Art of the Dress... is that it should <i>fit</i>.”</p><p class="double">The others nearly fell over.</p><p class="double">“I think that was in our first lesson, before the pony had a dress on...” Zecora said, thoroughly confused.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Tiara confirmed. “That&#039;s <i>not</i> a secret.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Rarity smiled mysteriously. “Look around at these dresses I&#039;ve made for every mare who loops. Which one is going to... Rainbow Dash?”</p><p class="double">Diamond looked for a few seconds, then pointed. “That one.”</p><p class="double">“Precisely. Why?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” the filly looked it up and down. “Er... well, it&#039;s in her size, and it&#039;s got a cloud motif, and it has a diaphanous material so it billows out when she moves fast like she always does...”</p><p class="double">“And the cut is built for speed,” Zecora finished. “It is Dash&#039;s dress indeed.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly.” Rarity looked between them. “It&#039;s fitting for her.”</p><p class="double">“...<i>oh</i>,” Tiara said, tapping a hoof. “<i>That</i> kind of fit.”</p><p class="double">“Well, yes and no.” Rarity trotted over to the sewing machine, and started working absently. Her telekinesis picked up all the tools she needed, and she began making an outfit out of shimmering water-cloth cut through with mercury-cloth. “If I were to give a poor peasant a slap-up dinner, would that be generous?”</p><p class="double">“Well... yes?” Tiara agreed. “That seems simple. I mean, you&#039;re giving her something.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, but if I gave it to a noble like High Jump or Blueblood?” Rarity peered at them as the shoulders came together. “Ah, now it&#039;s more interesting, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">She whistled a few notes of <i>Art of the Dress.</i> “True generosity isn&#039;t just giving things away. It&#039;s more subtle than that. The reason our Elements all have – very minor, admittedly – healing properties is part of the same thing.”</p><p class="double">With a flourish, the dress was finished. “It&#039;s about <i>completeness</i>. Generosity is filling in the holes in someone, the things they lack – and so deftly that, ideally, you&#039;d never know they were there in the first place.”</p><p class="double">“So...” Zecora frowned. “A true dress should be like air – it&#039;s hard to tell it&#039;s even there.”</p><p class="double">“Precisely.” Rarity smiled. “It&#039;s only <i>really</i> worked a few times – it&#039;s an exacting art – but my truest masterpieces are the ones which just match their wearers. So well that your mental picture of that person includes the dress – and doesn&#039;t really change at all.”</p><p class="double">She pointed to Zecora. “Your work in potions...” and to Diamond. “And your work with philanthropy, leadership and... well, essentially what you do... I bet they work best when used to build up a person from within, rather than impose from without. Strengthen them.”</p><p class="double">“Fill in the blanks,” Diamond said slowly. “Yes, I think that makes sense.”</p><p class="double">“Well,” and the fashion unicorn shrugged. “It&#039;s only conjecture on my part, but it <i>does</i> seem to hang together.”</p><p class="double">“Right.”</p><p class="double">Zecora nodded.</p><p class="double">“Oh...” Tiara pointed to the dress. “Who&#039;s that for?”</p><p class="double">Rarity simply raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">“Silver Spoon, I would guess,” Zecora decided. “It is a <i>quick</i>silver dress.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right.” Rarity held it up, showing that the material settled down to a faint silver-sheen ripple once it wasn&#039;t moving any more. “I overcharged the normal adjust-form enchantment, so it should keep pace with her shifts.”</p><p class="double">She tapped a hoof on the floor. “Now, if only I had someone here who could deliver it to her... perhaps a close friend, or perhaps someone who shared an important moment with her.”</p><p class="double">Carefully, Rarity folded the new dress into a box, wrapped it in paper, and placed it between the two.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll let you work out which would be <i>more</i> generous,” she said, winking, and headed into the back room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Addendum by KrisOverstreet</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Two days later, Rarity found Diamond Tiara and Zecora still in the room, staring at the box. &quot;Well?&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara said, &quot;We can&#039;t find a polite word that rhymes with &#039;impasse.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The right to Silver Spoon&#039;s dress supply, neither of us could the other deny,&quot; Zecora added.</p><p class="double">Rarity shook her head. &quot;It appears I&#039;ll need a quicksilver accessory to go with the dress. A bracelet, perhaps? Better yet, a bracer! Or perhaps a bangle for her hair? Or possibly all three! It is enchanted mercury, after all!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, not to interrupt your creative process, but can we go eat now?&quot; Diamond Tiara asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, er, right. I&#039;ll have it done in a couple of days, whatever it is. And then we can decide which of you-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NO!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Or you could take them together,&quot; Rarity replied meekly. &quot;That works also.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.6</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You mean it?” Applebloom asked, teary-eyed.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ll buy the farm off us?” Applejack held out a hoof, and Flam took it somewhat bemusedly. “Four bits and a smile, done! Alright, family, we&#039;re free!”</p><p class="double">Cheering, Applebloom cantered off down the road. Big Mac followed, moving his sleeping grandmother on her chair, and Applejack paused only long enough to collect four bits from the unresisting Flim and Flam before hurrying off after them.</p><p class="double">“...well, I&#039;m not complaining,” Flim said, nudging his brother. “That&#039;s the best that that scam&#039;s ever gone.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed it is, brother mine,” Flam agreed. “Now, let&#039;s see what we&#039;ve purchased for a song.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack whistled to herself as she Earthbent them a small mansion, and Applebloom finalized a nanovirus that would give them the furnishings they needed.</p><p class="double">Mac glanced over at Granny Smith. “Still sleepin,” he reported.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Applejack looked over at their old home, and grinned. “Ah&#039;ve wanted this for quite a while, y&#039; know.. not all that virtuous, ah&#039;ll admit, but funny as hay.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the dim pre-dawn light, magic moved on silent paws.</p><p class="double">Well, more technically, <i>kindness</i> moved on silent paws.</p><p class="double">The small farm cat that was Fluttershy padded into the Apple farmhouse, and checked that both Flim and Flam were asleep.</p><p class="double">Then she moved to the door, yawned – she&#039;d had a late night – and connected to nature on a deep and fundamental level.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy might not be an Earth Pony by blood – not usually, anyway – but she was certainly something close.</p><p class="double"><i>“Animate Plants.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Yep,” Applejack said critically, as a tree threw Flam twenty feet into the air. “That&#039;s an Apple tree bein&#039; playful, alright.”</p><p class="double">She put her hooves around her mouth. “That one&#039;s kinda frisky first thing in th&#039; morning! Try givin&#039; her a cup of tea!”</p><p class="double">Flim crawled up to the fence. “What... in Equestria...”</p><p class="double">“Well, this farm is kinda high maintenance,” Applejack said casually. “&#039;s why we have the best apples, place is full of life. But, y&#039; know... buyer beware.”</p><p class="double">She&#039;d have to thank Fluttershy for this.</p><p class="double">After they&#039;d let the brothers sell them the farm back, of course. Four bits and a smile sounded about right. And then &#039;shy and Rarity could give them a talk about proper business practices.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.7 (Bardic Knowledge, Filraen and DrTempo)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u><b>Sunset and the Doctor</b></u></p><p class="double">Variations to the Loop were only slightly more common on the other side of the mirror than in Equestria proper, since most other Loops were populated by humans, so whenever Sunset Looped into &quot;home,&quot; she was generally prepared to meet visitors to Canterlot High, especially those who were resistant to attending high school a second time. Teachers were a different matter, since most Loopers had little idea on <i>how</i> to teach. She sat down in her sciences class, already familiar with the subject for the most part.</p><p class="double">So the new arrival was only sort of expected.</p><p class="double">After everyone was seated, the teacher entered. He was tall, with gray hair and a frilly, almost Victorian-looking, outfit. His skin was peach in tone, which while somewhat normal for a regular human, it tended to stand out amongst the technicolour population of Canterlot High.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good afternoon, class,&quot; he announced. &quot;I&#039;m your new teacher. My name is Doctor... John- no, that doesn&#039;t fit this world does it... Time Turner, yes, that&#039;s right. I&#039;d prefer, however, if you just refer to me as Doctor.&#039;&quot; He started writing on the board. &quot;Now, to establish a bit of a baseline, who here is familiar with the concept of a &#039;Time Loop?&#039; Anyone at all?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset was the only one to raise her hand.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excellent. Miss...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shimmer, Doctor. Sunset Shimmer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Shimmer. I have a special assignment for you, then. Please see me after class. Now then, we&#039;ll see how much knowledge we can stuff into your heads by the end of the period, shall we?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset was certain she heard him mutter, &quot;Hopefully you&#039;ll retain more than the Brigadier ever did.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr> </p><p class="double">Time Turner spoke with an unusual accent, which now Sunset realized was similar to British from some human loops, though Sunset realized it could be easily faked with no special Looper skill required. And the famously long scarf was just in one corner on the hat rack, right next to a fez. How she hadn&#039;t seen it before was a mystery. In the end Sunset decided to give the benefit of the doubt on Time Turner being the Doctor, as she didn’t know enough about him to disprove any evidence he may have with him.</p><p class="double">After classes ended both waited until all other students left the class. The teacher spoke first as he approached Sunset Shimmer: &quot;Now, Miss Shimmer, if you would be so kind. Might I ask after the Anchor of this quaint Loop? I haven&#039;t had much experience outside my own, you see. Even my first Fused Loop was in my own universe.&quot;</p><p class="double">No ping and now this… is the Doctor a young looper? It made a weird kind of sense. &quot;Um, okay,&quot; still baffled, Sunset did her best to answer. &quot;This is a sort of parallel subset of the Equestrian Loops. Our Anchor is Twilight Sparkle, and she&#039;s probably just moving to Ponyville now. I don&#039;t know if anyone else is Awake, the ping doesn&#039;t work very well through the mirror.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually… are you the Anchor of your world?” Sunset Shimmer asked in a pensive look.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I am indeed the Anchor for my little Branch of the World Tree. Still working on the ping, too. Rather more complicated than you all let on.&quot; He tapped his chin. &quot;Perhaps if I reverse the polarity... No, that couldn&#039;t possibly work.&quot;</p><p class="double">“Well, in that case there&#039;s no guarantee Twilight&#039;s Awake,” Sunset continued where she had left. “While multiple Anchors might be Awake in any given loop, only one is required and you’d fill the quota.”</p><p class="double">“I see.”</p><p class="double">Seeing the conversation being under control Sunset decided to launch the most complicated question she had. &quot;Look, I don&#039;t mean to be rude, but who are you? You can&#039;t possibly be who I think you are, but there&#039;s no other choice left.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And as the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, through Sherlock Holmes,” the Doctor said back,”&#039;when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&#039; Though, between you and me, I think he got that phrase from me.&quot;</p><p class="double">“Only in loops you exist.” Sunset sniped back.</p><p class="double">The Doctor chuckled “True, true.”</p><p class="double">Taking a more serious stance Sunset pressed on. “But seriously, isn’t your world Read-Only and forbidden to Loop?”</p><p class="double">&quot;It was,” the Doctor corrected. “You see, my original Administrator enlisted the help of Jörmungandr to upgrade something called an &#039;Ouroboros Patch.&#039; And, with that, I was activated as a Looper. It is rather annoying to Awaken as a different me all the time, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer blinked “So it’s like Link and Zelda?”</p><p class="double">“Who?”</p><p class="double">“Loopers from Hyrule.&quot; Sunset Shimmer explained. &quot;Their loop has reincarnation built in its life and death cycle so they tend to Awake in whole different eras.”</p><p class="double">The Doctor smiled wryly, “Somehow I don&#039;t think they can regenerate into different bodies and personalities about a dozen times in a single life.”</p><p class="double">&quot;Point.&quot;</p><p class="double">The conversation paused at this point and Sunset Shimmer looked outside. “It’s night already and everybody left. You said you wanted to meet our Anchor?” At the Doctor’s nod she pointed to Canterlot High’s front yard, “then let’s go the statue. That’s our ticket to meet her.”</p><p class="double">The Doctor stepped over to a wardrobe in the corner opposite the hat rack. How she missed that one was even more baffling, considering its blue colour. As he pulled out a light coat, she spotted a hard-to-miss overcoat with enough colours to make a clown jealous. With confirmation that he was the Doctor, she supposed it made some sense that he&#039;d have all his outfits.</p><p class="double">After leaving the classroom they walked in silence, leaving enough time for Sunset Shimmer to digest what had happened today. A grin started to creep its way across her face as she realized this had to be the biggest news in the entire Multiverse and she got to hear it first (not actually true, but she could be forgiven for thinking otherwise)! She had to see if the others were Awake. And if so, they needed to know <i>immediately</i>.</p><p class="double">“If you’re just starting to loop, Doctor, I&#039;m guessing you’ve always been a biped, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” The Doctor answered back, slightly confused. “Your point being?”</p><p class="double">“Travelling through the portal will change your shape.” Sunset answered back as she summoned her Keyblade. “You’ll probably become a pony just like me, and walking on four legs may be difficult if all your life… lives you’ve been a biped. Oh, and I&#039;ll have to seal the gate behind us. First time I did this, I forgot to do that, and some of the people here followed me through.&quot;</p><p class="double">“Understood, Miss Shimmer.” The Doctor said, apparently fascinated with how Sunset Shimmer summoned her giant key and worked it through the solid marble of the statue. “You know, it&#039;s quite the experience being the inexperienced one for a change.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a shared laugh, both walked through the portal into Equestria. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.8 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had tried many forms of meditation throughout the Loops, but her favorite method was still reshelving. Placing books in their allotted spaces according to a sensible sorting system satisfied her on some undefinable, almost visceral level. Maybe it was because she was doing it in a tree; she felt like she was helping in some small way to bring order to the ongoing chaos of Yggdrasil itself.</p><p class="double">The door opening interrupted her ruminations. &quot;Hi, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">She turned to the voice and smiled. &quot;Sunset? This is a pleasant surprise. We haven&#039;t even had the Running of the Leaves yet. What brings you here?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset floated a ring binder out of her saddlebags. &quot;I&#039;ve been noticing a trend lately. The last five times I woke up after the Fall Formal debacle, three girls showed some time later.&quot; She opened the binder to a photo, presumably of the three in question. &quot;It always happened near the end of the Loop, but each time was progressively earlier along the timeline.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took the binder in her magic and considered the image. &quot;Hmm. The girls have mentioned a trio like this once or twice, but we don&#039;t awaken in that universe often enough to determine trends. We&#039;d just assumed they were from another Loop with a high-school-age Anchor.&quot; She started paging through the rest of the binder. &quot;You&#039;ve been analyzing them?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset nodded. &quot;Every way I know how. Their singing is definitely magical; it seems to tie into their feeding methods.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which appear similar to those of changelings,&quot; noted Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Only with disharmony instead of love. I figured you should know.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight closed the binder. &quot;I really appreciate this, Sunset. I&#039;ll see if I can find anything about creatures with these properties.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset smiled. &quot;Thanks. I don&#039;t exactly have access to the right research materials most of the time.&quot; Her grin widened. &quot;Oh, and one more thing. Last I checked, they can&#039;t take a punch.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunset!&quot; A laugh took any bite out of the chastisement.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Her mock indignation only made Twilight laugh harder. &quot;They were singing about standing above the crowd, glory through competition. They should&#039;ve seen it coming!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.9 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Shining Armor kept the news to himself as best he could over the course of the Loop, even through the wedding. But after missing Sombra with a smite evil and nearly getting impaled by a jagged lance of crystal, he felt it was better to confess than to let the secret weigh on his heart.</p><p class="double">That night, in the royal bedchambers (newly furnished with sheets made this millennium) he broached the subject. &quot;So, Nyx and Lemon seem to be getting along well...&quot; His ears flattened as he mentally braced himself.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s nice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining felt a bit like he&#039;d put his hoof on a stair that wasn&#039;t there. He looked over to Cadance, who seemed engrossed in an Iris Drake novel. &quot;Um, yeah, it is.&quot; Surely Chrysalis hadn&#039;t replaced her. The changeling queen hadn&#039;t been Awake, but Fluttershy had pacified her easily. &quot;They... make a cute couple?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mm hmm.&quot; Cadance turned a page.</p><p class="double">&quot;So... their wedding?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Will happen when it happens. He hasn&#039;t even proposed yet, Shiny. You can&#039;t rush these things.&quot;</p><p class="double">And then Shining understood. &quot;Oh, you&#039;re one of those Loopers who tries to act out the local baseline. I wish you&#039;d told me before—&quot; Cadance whapped him over the head with the book. &quot;Ow!&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare glared at him. &quot;I am Mi Amore Cadenza, Princess of Love, Crystal Empress, several other titles depending on the Loop, and most importantly, your wife. And I am not in the mood for what you&#039;re trying to get me to do.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a brief silence as Shining tried to reorganize his thoughts. &quot;Wha?&quot; He belatedly realized he should&#039;ve waited longer.</p><p class="double">Cadance gave a soft smile that assured Shining that yes, this was his wife. &quot;Don&#039;t get me wrong, I still love weddings. They&#039;re beautiful celebrations of everything I hold dear. But the joke&#039;s gotten old.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The joke?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The &#039;Wedding-Crazy Cadance&#039; joke. I haven&#039;t really felt that way for a long, long time, but your reactions were so funny I kept it up.&quot; She sighed. &quot;But I&#039;m tired of everypony walking on eggshells around me. The joke&#039;s gotten old. I know what I did was wrong, but—&quot;</p><p class="double">She was cut off by her husband&#039;s embrace. &quot;You have no idea how happy I am to hear that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance smiled and returned the hug. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.10 (Masterweaver and Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Apple Bloom entered the bar with an awkward grin. &quot;Hey, uh, Mac?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeeyup?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ya know that meteor that crash landed in tha west field last night?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeenope.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...well, Ah kinda was poking around with it, with some basic, ya know, excavation machinery, and, uh, it kind of turned out ta be the AllSpark--&quot;</p><p class="double">A massive face with glowing eyes peered through the door. &quot;Momma? Can I come in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, just a sec honey, Ah&#039;ll be right out!&quot; The filly gave her brother a pleading look. &quot;Help?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac sighed, considered the situation, and nodded gravely. &quot;Now &#039;Bloom, Motherhood is a big responsibility, and I coulda&#039; <i>sworn</i> Applejack woulda&#039; gotten around ta givin&#039; you the <i>talk</i> by now, but-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eat a <i>sprig</i> ya thistle-sucker will ya help me or not!?&quot; she barely kept herself from shouting. By the end the stallion was already nodding with a wide smirk. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.11 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was just another day in Ponyville, if a bit sparse on Loopers this time around. Just like any other day, Twilight sat in her kitchen, waiting for her kettle to boil.</p><p class="double">Well, right up until somepony started knocking loudly on her door. &quot;Twilight? Open the door! Please? I need your help!&quot; Shutting off the stove with a sigh, Twilight started walking towards the door, pondering who the male voice belonged to.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh crap, somepony saw me.&quot; The knocking intensified, now interspersed with pings from Sunset Shimmer. &quot;Let me in! I&#039;m not safe out here! Lemmeinlemmeinlemmein!&quot;</p><p class="double">The moment the door was unlocked, Sunset tumbled into the room, before slamming the door shut and locking it. Aside from the fact that Sunset was a stallion at the moment, Twilight honestly didn&#039;t see what he was panicking about.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, hello there, Handsome.&quot; Twilight blinked, shaking her head in confusion. <i>That isn&#039;t what I wanted to say.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no, not you too!&quot; Sunset now had his back pressed to the door, obviously considering taking his chances with whatever was outside.</p><p class="double">Closing her eyes, Twilight took a deep breath, and focused on what she <i>wanted</i> to say. &quot;Sunset, calm down. I know what&#039;s going on.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You-you do? You&#039;re not just saying that to trick me, right?&quot; Twilight imagined Sunset looked some combination of hopeful and suspicious, but she didn&#039;t open her eyes yet. This particular kind of mental effect required a well built counter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Every mare you&#039;ve met, that wasn&#039;t already in a relationship, has found you attractive, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And they&#039;ve all started vying for your attention, competing with each other, often injuring you in the process, and generally making your life miserable?&quot; Twilight finished her preparations, and opened her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;You really do know what this is, don&#039;t you?&quot; Sunset had visibly calmed while Twilight&#039;s eyes were closed.</p><p class="double"><i>Best just rip this band-aid off now.</i> &quot;You&#039;re a Harem Protagonist this loop. You&#039;re literally the most desirable stallion on the planet right now.&quot; Stepping up to him, Twilight gave Sunset a hug. &quot;Trust me, I know your pain. Go hide in my basement, I&#039;ll round up everypony else that&#039;s Awake, and we&#039;ll walk you through how to deal with this.&quot;</p><p class="double">While being taller than Twilight was novel, Sunset began to feel uncomfortable as the hug drew out. &quot;Um, Twilight? It&#039;s not that I mind the hug, but shouldn&#039;t you be going?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight pushed away with a jerk. &quot;I wasn&#039;t staring at your flank!&quot;</p><p class="double">After an awkward silence, Sunset walked past the blushing mare. &quot;I&#039;m just going to go hide.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Later that morning, Twilight had gathered their friends in the library&#039;s basement. Besides herself and Sunset, it was just Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Luna for this loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, now that we&#039;re all here, let&#039;s talk about this.&quot; Twilight slipped into lecture mode. &quot;So far, we only know two sure-fire ways to defuse the Harem Protagonist Effect.</p><p class="double">First off, fleeing Canterlot High was the best thing you could do. In addition to bringing our options into the game, you&#039;ve also left a possible highschool rom-com. Before we continue, I have one other important question. Did Celestia, Cadance, or any other alicorn see you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that I know of.&quot; Sunset&#039;s voice came, from the cardboard box she hid under.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good, without an alicorn after you, just being a moon-hermit for the loop is a valid option. Rainbow tried that once, after an unawake Luna had started to pursue her; it didn&#039;t work.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;On the other hoof, the Cloud Fortress she built me was pretty nice.&quot; Rainbow broke in. &quot;Also, as Trixie found out, don&#039;t try and be a performer when you&#039;re a Harem Protag.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do I want to know?&quot; Luna inquired.</p><p class="double">&quot;Two words, shipping wars.&quot; Applejack told her. &quot;It came down to her thousands of fans factionalizing, rallying behind those they all felt were the best choices for her. The fightin&#039; was a thing to see; we&#039;re talkin&#039; battalion level combat, thousands o&#039; pies thrown. They ended up breaking Discord out months early, then he declared Trixie was to be his Queen o&#039; Chaos.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Moving on, both of those incidents gave us datapoints on how to get out of it.&quot; Twilight continued. &quot;The only other way we&#039;ve found to get out of this, thus far, is to subvert the genre. Instead of playing along, or trying to ignore them all, you choose. Even in Trixie&#039;s case, after her shotgun wedding, all her other suitors moved on.”</p><p class="double">“Which brings me to why I went out to get everypony. A couple times now, we&#039;ve had somepony marry another Looper, and while the relationship stayed platonic, the public marriage staved off any further problems.”</p><p class="double">“So! Would you like to choose, or shall we play spin the bottle?&quot; Twilight paused. &quot;That came out wrong. Anyway, Sunset?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Can I just get a lift to the moon? Maybe some help in making it habitable?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But! But! You could be a datapoint! An important datapoint!&quot; Twilight pleaded.</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, my research! C&#039;mon, Sunny, old buddy, old pal? Please?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.12&nbsp;&nbsp;(AcademicPony)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Five fillies and an alicorn were relaxing in the Golden Oak Library. The pleasant smell of paper filled the air, and six glasses of iced fruit juice (bendy-straws optional) were a welcome respite from the warm summer&#039;s day outside.</p><p class="double">At a designated table, of course. This was a library, after all.</p><p class="double">Having the Cutie Mark Crusaders Awake made &quot;Twilight Time&quot; much simpler; doubly so with Diamond Tiara Awake as well. On the other hoof, this made it a challenge to find study material. On days like today, conversation topics tended to wander farther afield.</p><p class="double">Nyx sipped at her juice. The little alicorn filly&#039;s nose crinkled in thought, in an expression that Twilight and Rarity had privately agreed ranked at least &quot;0.2 squees&quot; on the Fluttershy scale. A few moments later, that thought was voiced.</p><p class="double">&quot;Momma,&quot; she asked, &quot;what did you and Celestia do that time you experimented with the sun?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, yeah,&quot; Scootaloo chimed in. &quot;That sounds like it would have been awesome! Even if, well...&quot; She trailed off, seeing Twilight twitch at memories of the Eiken loop that followed.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom, on the other hand, looked miffed. &quot;Wait, y&#039;all went messing around with stars without inviting me? I&#039;ve got loads of gear I&#039;ve been wanting to try out. I figured I&#039;d have to wait for another Trek loop before having the resources.&quot; She paused to take another sip of her own drink. &quot;Stellar engineering ain&#039;t easy, ya know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know, Sweetie managed it pretty easily during the Arda loop,&quot; Diamond Tiara chimed in. The smirk she directed at Sweetie Belle was a friendly one; a far cry from the expressions used by her baseline counterpart.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle shifted uncomfortably. &quot;I had help; all of the Ainur worked together for that. Besides,&quot; she smirked looking at Twilight, &quot;we&#039;re getting off-topic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath, and sighed. &quot;All right; I suppose it&#039;ll have to come out eventually. It was near the end of a loop, and it was more than just Celestia; she and Luna were both there, along with the original Element bearers...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Make haste, Twilight Sparkle. I do not know how long I can maintain this expansion.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s voice was strained - and for good reason. The basement underneath the Golden Oak Library held rather more space than usual, even given Twilight&#039;s propensity for digging extra storage rooms. &quot;Space&quot; was also a bit more literal than usual, given that her basement didn&#039;t normally have a G-class star inside of it. Looping prominences cast harsh flickering light across the faces of both Royal Alicorn Sisters. Celestia&#039;s usually-serene expression couldn&#039;t quite mask stress matching her sister&#039;s, as she struggled to hold the star in place and keep it compressed enough to fit within the library&#039;s expanded confines.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m almost ready!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rushed to and fro, making final adjustments to the jumbled mass of humming equipment that circled the central space. The other Element-bearers waited uncomfortably on the circular platform she&#039;d assigned to them. For all that they&#039;d seen non-Euclidean space before, that didn&#039;t make it pleasant to stare at. Glancing about the periphery wasn&#039;t any more pleasant; they could either watch Twilight prancing about in full mad scientist mode, or glance at the two Royal Sisters who were struggling, with obvious stress, to keep the unsettlingly large ball of fire sharing the room contained.</p><p class="double">Four out of five were uncomfortable, at any rate. Rainbow Dash had pulled a pair of sunglasses and a deck chair out of her pocket and was basking. Finally, Twilight trotted back to the group.</p><p class="double">&quot;All right girls, elements on, and formation!&quot;</p><p class="double">Six pairs of eyes closed, and six faces took on an expression of deep concentration. A familiar aura of power enfolded the Bearers, lifting them into the air, and as they opened their eyes, rainbow light burst forth. Instead of stopping, though, the drain went on and on. Twilight&#039;s eyes glowed with white fire as she poured more power into the Sun. Finally the light faded, and the bearers sank to the ground in exhaustion. Twilight remained standing, though, horn aura glowing violet-white.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, Twi,&quot; Applejack asked, &quot;ain&#039;t it over? We used the elements like you told us to, shouldn&#039;t they be doin&#039; the rest of the heavy lifting?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They are, Applejack,&quot; Twilight replied, teeth gritted. &quot;I still have to guide the process. Celestia and Luna are still holding on as well.&quot; The farm-pony glanced over towards the royal couple, whose strained faces confirmed that yes, keeping a star in Twilight&#039;s basement was still requiring effort.</p><p class="double">Rainbow was looking at the sun and scowling. &quot;So, what was this supposed to do again? The sun still looks like it did before.&quot; This wasn&#039;t quite true, she decided. There was a faint shimmer of magic around the flickering tongues of fire, and... was it getting smaller?</p><p class="double">&quot;It should be starting any second now... there!&quot; Twilight&#039;s panting slowed, and her horn aura dimmed to its usual pink. Her grin had come back, and that wasn&#039;t entirely reassuring. &quot;It&#039;s collapsing; you can see the accretion disk starting to form. If this works, we&#039;ll have magical power to spare! Think of it, girls - we could set up our workshops in hours instead of weeks, run extra-space charms powerful enough to hold entire cities, maybe even directly connect normal space to our pockets! There&#039;s no limit to what we could accomplish!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the elements do what now?&quot; Rainbow still looked confused.</p><p class="double">&quot;They set up a harmonic resonance, and I&#039;m using it to halt the collapse at the last moment so that we can extract power. It&#039;s harmony that makes all of this work!&quot;</p><p class="double">The eight ponies watched as the sun shrank to a disc which swirled around an eye-hurtingly bright point of light.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, this is our magic element swirly-thing?&quot; Rainbow ventured.</p><p class="double">Rarity responded to that. &quot;&#039;Swirly thing&#039;, darling? Let&#039;s not be so gauche. Rainbow spiral, perhaps?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe. Harmony cyclone?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy had been watching the disk contract, and finally spoke. &quot;Um, actually, it doesn&#039;t look like a cyclone any more. It looks almost like an eye.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re all close,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;It&#039;s inspired by something I&#039;d encountered in the Who loop. Girls, we now have our very own Eye of -&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a faint popping sound, and twin gasps of pain from Celestia and Luna. They fell to the floor... which was a lot more ordinary-looking than it had been a moment ago. Twilight&#039;s head whipped back and forth between her beloved mentor and trusted friend, and the empty, normal-sized room where a star was supposed to be. &quot;What happened? Is everypony all right? What happened to the Sun? Did you have to pocket it? Did anything else - &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m all right, Twilight,&quot; Celestia replied. The monarch looked worse for wear, but was recovering. &quot;My connection to the spell vanished, but I don&#039;t seem to have experienced any ill effects from that. Lulu, did the same thing happen to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, sister,&quot; Luna said, as her panting slowed and became normal breaths. &quot;One moment, I was straining to hold this much Sky in one place, and the next it was as if I hadn&#039;t begun the spell.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight was distraught. &quot;But, but - the Eye! What happened to it? It was working, and we could have done so much!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie bounced up to interrupt her monologue. &quot;Mmf! M found this!&quot; With that, she deposited a small piece of paper at Twilight&#039;s hooves, and bounced off again humming happily.</p><p class="double">Twilight levitated the slip of paper in front of her, reading it.</p><p class="double"><i>What part of &quot;read-only&quot; wasn&#039;t clear, Sparkle?</i></p><p><i>-Skuld</i></p><p class="double">&quot;...Tree-damnit.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Eight ponies - three weary, four quietly relieved, and one prancing - made their way up the stairs from the basement. Upon entering the library proper, another surprise waited for them. Stacks and stacks of paper filled the foyer floor to ceiling, teetering precariously. A scroll with a purple ribbon rested in front of the nearest pile.</p><p class="double">Twilight opened it with trepidation.</p><p class="double"><i>Community service paperwork - lot 1 of 277,432.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;...For birch&#039;s sake.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Five fillies sipped their juice as they juice as they digested the story.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom spoke first. &quot;Ah&#039;m torn between askin&#039; ya for your schematics, or avoidin&#039; Who-tech all together. That punishment don&#039;t sound like fun, and I&#039;m gettin&#039; the impression she still went easy on ya.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, it could have been much worse,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;Even so, that&#039;s more paperwork than I ever want to see in one place again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, wait - paperwork!&quot; Scootaloo chimed in. &quot;So that loop where we were all your daughters, and you couldn&#039;t spend time with us because there was too much you had to do as Queen -&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;Got it in one. That was a major contributor to it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie piped up. &quot;So, did you finish it before taking your, um, sabbatical as &#039;Northern Twilight&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s chin lowered to rest on the table, gaze held off in the far distance. &quot;No. By the time that loop ended, I was a quarter done.&quot;</p><p class="double">The fillies pondered that. Nyx summed up the group&#039;s feelings eloquently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remind me never to tick off Skuld.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.13 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Is... is mom fighting a dragon?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...On her own?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Did she just cast a spell?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But she&#039;s a pegasus--!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, she isn&#039;t right now.&quot; Dinky tapped her horn. &quot;Grew one of these before taking off.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sparkler stared at her distant mother, jaw dropped. &quot;She... what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that was my reaction too.&quot; Dinky shrugged. &quot;I&#039;m still in shock, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can understand that....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">114.7 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After the rather disorienting experience of traversing the barrier between worlds unprotected, the Doctor found himself rather awkwardly falling from an upright position into his new body&#039;s proper quadrupedal stance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Odd,&quot; commented Sunset, hovering her Keyblade in her magic as she re-locked the gateway. &quot;I would&#039;ve thought you&#039;d look a bit... browner.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor gave himself a once-over. His tail was as grey and curly as his hair (and what a novel experience, having a tail), and his coat retained a peach-pale tone. He kept his suit jacket and frilled shirt, but his light jacket and pants seemed to have vanished. And on his rear was an hourglass, with most of the sand in the top bulb. &quot;And just why is that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we have a pony-slash-person in our Branch called Time Turner who&#039;s brown with a spiky mane. He&#039;s got the hourglass cutie mark, too.&quot; She looked closer at his hourglass. &quot;Though, yours seems to have more sand in the top.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds like he&#039;d be very similar to my tenth self. You say this image is called a &#039;cutie mark?&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, it&#039;s supposed to signify a pony&#039;s special talent. And, as a Time Lord, yours would obviously be time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Quite right. Now, you were going to-&quot; The Doctor paused as he felt an unusual burst of energy pass through him. &quot;My word. Is that what a ping is supposed to feel like?&quot; A moment later, several more bursts of energy were felt.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s right, you haven&#039;t quite gotten the hang of pings yet. Here, let me give you some tips...&quot;</p><p class="double">After Sunset explained the ping to the Doctor, Sunset said, &quot;Hang on, Doctor. This is going to be a wild ride!&quot; Using the Force to grab the Doctor, Sunset cast the Rey Wing spell she learned from Lina Inverse to take flight.</p><p class="double">&quot;How exhilarating!&quot; The Doctor had rarely flown without a craft of some sort, the closest he&#039;d ever come being the time he borrowed the power of the Archangel Network to hover for a bit in his tenth incarnation.</p><p class="double">Sunset chuckled in reply. &quot;I&#039;ve picked up a few tricks in my time as a Looper.&quot; Soon enough, Sunset landed near Ponyville. Taking the time to grab a newspaper, she noticed it was a few weeks after the 1000th Summer Sun Celebration. &quot;It&#039;s a bit later than I thought. Still, this works just fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor straightened his suit jacket. &quot;My word, Miss Shimmer. What was that just now? Some form of telekinesis?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One was the Force, from the Star Wars universe. It&#039;s a bit easier to carry people that way than using my personal magic sometimes. The other was a spell called &#039;Rey Wing.&#039; Speaking of, if you ever have a Fused Loop with Lina Inverse, be careful. She tends to cause mass destruction.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor cocked an eyebrow, curious. &quot;And why does she cause mass destruction?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, the first time she Awakens to a new Fused Loop, she casts her signature spell to make sure it works. Said signature spell can flatten small villages. Other than that it&#039;s often incidental damage from fighting.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My word. I hope I don&#039;t run into her any time soon.” The Doctor looked around the quaint village of Ponyville. “Now then, you were going to show me to your Anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She lives over there, in the house-tree-library.&quot; The Doctor wasn&#039;t quite sure what to make of that, but he had seen some very odd things in his time.</p><p class="double">As the two trotted toward the library, Sunset gave the Doctor some tips on several of the Loops she had been to.</p><p class="double">“Now, one of the Original Seven, Ranma, has a rather interesting home Loop. It&#039;s so focused on various martial arts, that it started making some up, like Martial Arts Tea Ceremony-” Suddenly, Sunset saw a certain pink party pony out of the corner of her eye, shaking like mad. She held up a hoof to the Doctor as she paused.</p><p class="double">Smirking, Sunset said to the Doctor, &quot;Follow my lead. I just thought of something that&#039;ll make your big debut as a Looper more fitting for you. After all, you&#039;re the one person everyone thought would never Awaken.&quot; The Doctor cocked his eyebrow in a specific manner, Delphon for “you&#039;re the expert here.”</p><p class="double">Sunset, loudly, asked the Doctor, &quot;So, feeling a little Loopy?&quot;</p><p class="double">Doing his best to guess where she was going with this, the Doctor replied, &quot;Yes, but now I feel quite Awake. For the first time, so to speak.&quot; Pinkie looked at the Doctor, curiously.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, you&#039;re a Doctor, right? What&#039;s your specialty?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Ah,</i> he thought, <i>this other pony must be Awake as well.</i> Out loud, he replied, &quot;Well, anything, everything. Time in particular.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie stared at the two of them for a long moment, blinking, before shrugging and continuing on her merry way.</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s not the reaction I was expecting,” remarked Sunset.</p><p class="double">“What do you mean?”</p><p class="double">“I thought for sure she&#039;d zip off, raring to get a party together for you.” Sunset shook her head. “She&#039;s acting odd, even for herself.”</p><p class="double">“Hmm. Well, regardless, you were going to introduce me to your Anchor, Miss Shimmer.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once they were out of view of pretty much anypony, but still quite a ways from the library, Sunset paused. &quot;Doctor. There&#039;s something that&#039;s been nagging at me for a while now, but it&#039;s difficult to talk about with people from here. We&#039;re all so very forgiving, after all.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor looked at her, puzzled, &quot;Nothing wrong with a bit of forgiveness. But, why are you asking me? There must be more experienced Loopers out there who can advise you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, but there&#039;s something about you. I think it has to do with all the experience your baseline alone gives you.”</p><p class="double">Sunset took a deep breath. “Anyways, in our baseline... I go a little insane. I stole Twilight&#039;s crown, the Element of Magic, one of Equestria&#039;s most powerful artifacts, and intended to use it to invade Equestria and take it over with an army of mind-controlled teenagers.&quot; Sunset looked at the ground, haunted by her baseline memories.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I take it you&#039;re worried about potentially backsliding, is that it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In a way. You see, Equestria is ruled over by Alicorns, a pony made of all the pony tribes. And almost all the Looping Equestrians are or can become them at will. I&#039;m worried that if my time to ascend to Alicorn ever comes, that I&#039;ll wind up going mad with power again. Especially since I&#039;m told emotions run a little hotter when someone ascends.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor nodded in understanding. Fortunately, he had a few examples he could pull from. &quot;I see. Tell me, my dear, do you know of my Warrior incarnation?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve heard of it, yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He did many terrible things in the Time War. Enough to feel that he should renounce the very name of &#039;Doctor.&#039;&quot; It was difficult to think of that era in his life. The Time War had been so long and so brutal, that by the end of it he had practically forgotten his true age and just reset the age he gave to around eight hundred and something.</p><p class="double">The haunted look faded somewhat as he looked into her eyes. &quot;I have since learned that there are many ways of being a Doctor. However, it is still very difficult to forgive that part of myself for what he did – and what he intended to do. It&#039;s the same for what my tenth incarnation did when he tried to break a Fixed Point, calling himself &#039;the Time Lord Victorious.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor paused. &quot;What I&#039;m getting at, Miss Shimer... Sunset, is that even if you do something terrible, if you learn from it and use its lesson to be better, you have nothing to fear from that part of you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset stood in silence for a minute. &quot;Thank you. I&#039;m still not sure I&#039;m ready to be an Alicorn. But if it happens, I&#039;ll try not to fear myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor patted her on the shoulder. &quot;That&#039;s all anyone can do with themselves. Shall we continue?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset shook herself. &quot;Right.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, Doctor, this is it,” said Sunset, as they stood in front of the library.</p><p class="double">“No need to stand around, I think.” And with that, the Doctor pulled open the door, inwardly marvelling at the dexterity of his hooves.</p><p class="double">“Hello,” greeted Twilight. “Oh, Sunset! We don&#039;t usually see you around now. What&#039;s up?”</p><p class="double">“We have a new Looper,” grinned Sunset, gesturing to the Doctor.</p><p class="double">“Good afternoon, Miss Sparkle. I&#039;m the Doctor.”</p><p class="double">“Nice try, but I don&#039;t think so.”</p><p class="double">The Doctor gave her an incredulous look. “I beg your pardon?”</p><p class="double">“He sounds like one of the Doctor, but that&#039;s easy to replicate. I&#039;m surprised you thought this would work, Sunset.”</p><p class="double">“Now see here-” The Doctor restrained himself from yelling angrily at the unicorn. “What must I do to prove to you who I am?”</p><p class="double">“Time travel.”</p><p class="double">“The TARDIS didn&#039;t follow me over. And even if she had, there&#039;s no artron energy in your universe, so she wouldn&#039;t be able to move.”</p><p class="double">“Sonic Screwdriver.”</p><p class="double">“Is there anything in here <i>not</i> made of wood?”</p><p class="double">“Regenerate?”</p><p class="double">“Aside from wanting to remain myself, I&#039;m not currently Gallifreyan and therefore cannot.”</p><p class="double">Sunset looked between the two as they continued their verbal tennis match. Every time Twilight asked something of the Doctor, he&#039;d give a good reason he couldn&#039;t do it or an answer that Twilight would dismiss as “common knowledge” about the Doctor&#039;s adventures. After several minutes of this, Sunset and the Doctor found themselves outside the library.</p><p class="double">“Of all the nerve,” grumbled the Doctor. “I have half a mind to-”</p><p class="double">“Please, Doctor, let&#039;s just try someone else, okay? Rarity lives closest, we can see if she&#039;s Awake.”</p><p class="double">As it turns out, she was. However, while she complimented the Doctor on his current outfit, she didn&#039;t believe them either. Nor did Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash. And with each failure, the Doctor became angrier and angrier.</p><p class="double">“Millions of Loops under your collective belts and not one of them seems to think I could possibly be who I say I am?! The absolute nerve!”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s still a few ponies left to try, Doctor. We&#039;ve only met half the pings out there. Going by the trend, I&#039;m sure Applejack must be Awake, and she&#039;s the Element of Honesty. She <i>has</i> to believe us.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t believe it.”</p><p class="double">The pair stared incredulously.</p><p class="double">“That does it!” The Doctor shouted. “I-”</p><p class="double">“No, that ain&#039;t what I meant,” interrupted Applejack. “I can feel the truth in what yer sayin&#039;. He&#039;s really the Doctor. I was just so shocked I could scarcely believe my own senses.”</p><p class="double">“I knew we could rely on you, AJ,” sighed a relieved Sunset. “Every other Element wouldn&#039;t believe us at all. They thought we were pranking them.”</p><p class="double">“Now, I could be a mite offended that ya didn&#039;t come ta me first, but I know I&#039;m a bit out of the way compared to everypony other than Fluttershy.”</p><p class="double">“Do you think you could help us tell everyone else?”</p><p class="double">“Well, first we should go meet up with Apple Bloom. She&#039;s going to be so ecstatic to meet ya Doctor. She&#039;s been working on her own Sonic Screwdriver, y&#039;see. After that, we&#039;ll hope that nopony thinks ya managed to rope me inta a prank.”</p><p class="double">“Won&#039;t she have met me when I was unAwake?” asked the Doctor.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not actually sure. The only time I&#039;ve heard of her meetin&#039; a version of ya was when we were replacing all of ya&#039;ll.”</p><p class="double">“My word, replacing all of me? How did that work?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Princess Celestia was in the place o&#039; yer first self...” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i></p><p class="double"><i>This loop I got a reminder on how someone or somepony who lacks evidence to prove their word isn&#039;t automatically a liar, and how a little bit of trust can get goodwill on others, especially on a young looper, as well as helping to realize an amazing discovery: the Doctor, whose very world was once unable to loop, is now looping.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your faithful student</i></p><p><i>Sunset Shimmer</i> </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Hold on, I&#039;m coming up there!&quot;</p><p class="double">Loop memories burst into her mind as the clip clop of someone rapidly ascending the stairs hit her ears. By the time the golden unicorn had entered, she&#039;d managed to at least calm down into heavy breathing. &quot;I&#039;m okay, Sunset, I... I&#039;m fine, just a scare.&quot; Right, not born with wings, didn&#039;t get them till later apparently...</p><p class="double">Very slowly the unicorn nodded. &quot;Yeah, I know how that feels. Waking Up to something odd can drive me Loopy too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cynder froze for a moment, before very slowly meeting the eyes of Sunset Shimmer.</p><p class="double">Sunset gave her a quirked brow and a small smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;...yeah, especially when you don&#039;t have anyone to Anchor you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, good,&quot; the unicorn sighed in relief, &quot;I didn&#039;t know if I was right. Let me guess, you usually have wings?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. Also I&#039;m normally about your size.&quot; Cynder stood up and examined herself. &quot;Bipedal, huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s not too weird is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. Yes. Well, it&#039;s...&quot; Cynder shrugged helplessly and almost fell over. &quot;Whoa!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset lit her horn and grabbed her. &quot;Careful! You&#039;ll need to balance with your tail for the moment.&quot; She steadied the dragoness gently, shaking her head. &quot;I remember my first time on two legs, it was pretty awkward. Anyway, welcome to Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you.&quot; Another memory surfaced. &quot;You... hatched me this loop, didn&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm. And Twilight hatched Spike. She&#039;s the local anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. That&#039;s good to know.&quot; Cynder readied herself and took a few steps forward. &quot;Right. What are the dangers here? I mean, do I need to prepare for any ancient evils, armies, dark magicians...?&quot;</p><p class="double">For less than a second, Sunset seemed to frown, her eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. But the expression was gone in a blink, and the unicorn smiling warmly. &quot;Actually, we&#039;ve appointed ourselves as a sanctuary loop. It&#039;s our duty to make sure that visitors can relax, unwind, and detox from the loops. Most of our ancient evils are reformed and looping anyway, all we need to handle are a few jerks and one or two other situations.&quot;</p><p class="double">She paused.</p><p class="double">&quot;...I just want to be clear on this, though. We want to help, but we don&#039;t want to make you uncomfortable.

Eventually, she slumped her shoulders with a sad sigh. &quot;Am I really that obvious...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. Trust me. I...&quot; Sunset glanced away. &quot;I know what guilt looks like. Feels like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...you one of those reformed villains?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, pretty much.

I hadn&#039;t thought of it that way,&quot; Twilight admitted. &quot;To be honest, my mind is still kind of stuck thinking of you as this love-obsessed-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, yes, I know,&quot; Cadence sighed. &quot;The joke wore out, and I&#039;m sorry about taking it too far. But there&#039;s more to me than getting married, matchmaking, and using the sheer power of true love to swat down uppity evil husband-stealing bugs with delusions of competence. Er, no offense, sis.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;None taken,&quot; a pony absolutely identical in every way to Cadence except for the cutie mark (a heart made out of bug wings) said as she walked past. &quot;I&#039;m off to rehearse the cricket chorus for the Summer Sun Celebration. Back in time for Pinkie&#039;s party!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Explanations?&quot; Twilight asked, still a bit in shock.</p><p class="double">&quot;Apparently Chrysalis was your babysitter, if my Loop memories are accurate,&quot; Cadence said. &quot;We both Awoke over breakfast yesterday and compared notes. There&#039;s a legend about a lost kingdom in the Badlands that sounds suspiciously familiar.&quot; Cadence&#039;s smile faded a little as she added, &quot;Also, Shining isn&#039;t Awake this time, and Chrys and he are the ones with a... thing... this Loop. Seems I got married to my work.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Literally?&quot; Twilight had a mental image of Cadence in bridal gown standing next to a tall pile of paperwork wrapped in a tuxedo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Figure of speech. I wanted to prove to Celestia that I could handle the responsibility. Anyway, since we haven&#039;t heard from Trixie, we agreed to let Chrys go ahead with her relationship with your brother and see what happens.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Doesn&#039;t that bother you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A bit, but not terribly. If your brother were Awake, now that&#039;d be a different story, but the three of us have already had that discussion.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... see.&quot; Twilight decided to change the subject quickly. &quot;So, how difficult is it to be mayor of Ponyville?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not as difficult as being ruler of a semi-independent city-state,&quot; Cadence shrugged. &quot;If it weren&#039;t for the frequent disasters and the pervasive insanity running through the town, it&#039;d be a part-time job.&quot;</p><p class="double">The sound of a large two-stroke engine blocked further conversation. A familiar-looking earth pony, beige coat slightly spattered with pink mane dye, roared past on an enormous motorcycle, tie-dyed blouse flapping in the breeze. &quot;FREE! FREE! I&#039;M FINALLY FREE!! A-HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAA!!&quot; Ivory Scroll revved the engine, popped a wheelie, and sped across the stone bridge out of Ponyville and out of sight.</p><p class="double">&quot;A job which some ponies apparently handle better than others,&quot; Cadence concluded. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.4 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Mi Amore Cadenza looked down from her throne at the two petitioners. &quot;It is well known around Canterlot that I am the Princess of Love,&quot; she said. &quot;What fewer ponies have recognized is that I am as much a <i>princess</i> as I am a pony gifted with the talent for inspiring love between ponies. This gives me both the power and the responsibility to judge when a rare case arises where love has gone awry. And even fewer ponies are Awake,&quot; she said the last word with a definite emphasis, &quot;to the notion that I am just as serious about ending bad relationships as I am about celebrating good relationships.</p><p class="double">&quot;In short, we are present today to determine if the good ship <i>Rarishy</i>, for the good of the two ponies involved, needs sinking.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two ponies in question, standing at separate podiums, shuffled their hooves slightly. Fluttershy was Awake, which explained why she wasn&#039;t hiding behind her mane in such a public forum. Rarity, on the other hand, was not Awake this Loop, which explained the absence of Spike and the mascara streaked so heavily that the weeping pony had begun to resemble an equine-cheetah hybrid minus the spots.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your Highness,&quot; the latter began, &quot;I admit that our relationship has been difficult of late... but Fluttershy was one of my closest friends even before we married! We share so many interests, such as fashion and beauty and haute couture!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You just said the same thing twice,&quot; Fluttershy whispered.</p><p class="double">&quot;I recognize that I haven&#039;t been the best pony to live with,&quot; Rarity continued, &quot;but I am willing to make any change, any sacrifice to make this relationship work!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid that just isn&#039;t true, Your Highness,&quot; Fluttershy interrupted, softly but firmly. &quot;I&#039;m afraid we have irreconcilable differences as regards my animal friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have no problems with your animal friends,&quot; Rarity insisted. &quot;I just rather wish they would... er... remain outside.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember when I asked you for a pretty ribbon for Mrs. Boulevard?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You didn&#039;t tell me Mrs. Boulevard was a skunk!&quot; Rarity snapped. &quot;And that she was frightened of scissors!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mrs. Boulevard had a very traumatic experience with hedge shears as a pup,&quot; Fluttershy replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I had a very traumatic experience that required two tubs full of tomato juice to remove! But I was a very big pony about it,&quot; Rarity insisted, &quot;and I accepted her apology.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You offended her so terribly that she won&#039;t come back to our house!&quot; Fluttershy insisted. &quot;Nor would Mr. Creosote!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mr. Creosote is a wild boar hog,&quot; Rarity shouted, &quot;who destroyed my entire workroom because he didn&#039;t care for the decor!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He disagreed with your dislike for earth tones! And the LANGUAGE you used to him--!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He splashed mud over every available surface! I lost a dozen commissions because I couldn&#039;t remake them in time! I believe he deserved the talking-to I gave him!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you made Miss Snifflewuffins CRY!&quot; Fluttershy&#039;s shouting was almost as loud as Rarity&#039;s now.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Snifflewuffins is an ELEPHANT!&quot; Rarity threw her forehooves in the air. &quot;She smashed down the front WALL of the Boutique! WHERE this side of Zebrica did you find an-&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence pounded her gavel on the armrest of the throne until both ponies went silent. &quot;Ladies! Ladies! This is a court of Equestria! Please try to maintain some semblance of dignity!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy, taking several deep breaths, turned to face Cadence. &quot;Your Highness, even after I Woke Up-&quot; she said the two words with the same emphasis as Cadence had used earlier, but went on without pausing, &quot;-to the impossible situation, I tried to make the best of it- honest I did. But as much as I love Rarity as a friend- and she still is my friend- we really can&#039;t live under the same roof anymore. We&#039;re simply too different in our needs.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity sniffled, tears running down her face as Fluttershy gave her a sad but comforting glance.</p><p class="double">&quot;I believe I have heard enough to judge this on the merits,&quot; Cadence said. &quot;Your attempts to make your relationship work do you both credit, but it is blatantly obvious that neither of you can provide the kind of support the other needs. Rarity needs someone who can appreciate her need for a clean, secure home and work environment, and Fluttershy needs someone who can accept, or at least tolerate, her animal friends despite the difficulty. The two of you were born to be friends, not lifemates... and the bizarre circumstances that resulted in your marriage are enough to make anyone Loopy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence&#039;s horn glowed, and a very large cannon, muzzle pointed straight down, floated into view. &quot;I therefore grant Fluttershy&#039;s petition for a no-fault divorce with all property to be restored to its pre-marriage ownership. I hereby declare this ship... sunk.&quot; Cadence reached a hoof to the lanyard and yanked it.</p><p class="double">The cannon roared, sending its ball straight through the decks. Water began gushing from the hole almost immediately.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did we have to BE on the ship for this part?&quot; Rarity shrieked over the noise of witnesses screaming and galloping in terror.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wanted to make a statement!&quot; Cadence replied over the rushing water. &quot;It&#039;s not all about marriages for me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The next time I have a strange Loop like this,&quot; Fluttershy whimpered, &quot;I&#039;m asking Twilight for help.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.5 (Drachefly, Draconas, Gym Quirk, masterofgames, Daniel H, Dalxein, FanOfMostEverything, misterq, Hubris Plus, Snakes_Shadow, KrisOverstreet, Nikas)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight read from the scroll: &quot;Round 17: least impressive feat of the baseline character you were replacing, that you have never been able - not merely unwilling or never given the opportunity or need, but actually unable - to replicate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash raised a hoof. &quot;Reaching warp 10 without mechanical aid.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight clarified, &quot;A: I mean, something that the person you were replacing actually did in baseline, and B: aim as low as possible.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash nodded. &quot;Yup.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo spoke for everypony when she said, &quot;Who were you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight coughed. &quot;All right, we have a low bid of &#039;reaching warp 10 without mechanical aid.&#039; Let&#039;s ease our way down... any other not particularly impressively unimpressive worst best performances?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike sighed. &quot;When I was the Little Prince, even after I got rid of the vast majority of my body, I couldn&#039;t get back up into space.&quot;</p><p class="double">A brief silence. Scootaloo said, &quot;Uh, doesn&#039;t he die in baseline?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity put in, &quot;No, not at all! I was the flower one other time besides that one he&#039;s referring to. The unawake prince made it back, rather the worse for wear, but quite alive.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike added, &quot;To him, it&#039;s like Minovia Cay&#039;s space program, with unlimited parachutes and steering, but no boosters or launch system. Doable, but hard.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie blushed. &quot;I&#039;ve been Twilight several times, but I&#039;ve never been able to put the Ursa Minor back to sleep without help.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis (presently appearing as Cadence, who otherwise didn&#039;t exist in this variant) reached over and rubbed her head. &quot;Explode-a-bye baby, on the house top. When the bomb blows, the cradle will rock...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on, I wasn&#039;t doing it with explosions. I&#039;m just not that good with kids. What&#039;s yours, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blushed. &quot;I cannot replicate Wario&#039;s umm... Waft.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Boooring. Come on, Dissy, what&#039;s yours?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord flopped upward in despair before speaking, &quot;I can&#039;t manage even a single turn of Jenga!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... even if you really can&#039;t, I think that still counts as not having tried.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight concurred. &quot;We still have a best... worst... a low bid of not being able to put an Ursa Minor to sleep. Gilda?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda sighed. &quot;Pfeh. Unlike Amaterasu Sensei, I can&#039;t walk through town in feudal Japan, and not have anyone so much as glance at me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight objected, &quot;She does kind of have the species advantage.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, it fits.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm. I think it&#039;s different enough to not be quite the same. But close enough. And... it&#039;s kind of odd to hear you refer to her so formally.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda glanced around rapidly in panic, then laughed nervously. &quot;D-don&#039;t be silly! I always refer to her with respect.&quot; She then leaned over and put a claw to the side of her mouth. &quot;Stuff it, sparkle butt! She dropped off Chibi earlier, and the last thing I want is Boss thinking I&#039;m a bad influence on her kid!&quot; she hissed, gesturing with a head tilt to a white puppy who had slipped into Fluttershy&#039;s group of animal friends, begging for cuddles.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes lit up. &quot;Wait a moment! That reminds me - I found mine! When I attended Cromartie High, I was not able to maintain the usual masquerade that I was a boy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy offered, &quot;They noticed you were a robot?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. Well, they didn&#039;t notice I was a unicorn, but they did notice I was a girl.&quot; After a moment, she said, &quot;Actually, I&#039;m not sure that can really be attributed to any success or failure on my part since I took no steps whatsoever to conceal my body type. Let me think some more. Someone has to be able to beat &#039;concealing self in plain sight as an abnormal species&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra scowled with the intensity of multiple incensed personalities. &quot;I don&#039;t know how Guybrush does it, but my lungs just can&#039;t hold ten minutes of air. I had to use seapony magic instead.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right. New leader. Can anyone top that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle resignedly said, &quot;I simply can not qualify as a professional Go player.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash began to object, but checked herself and said, &quot;Yeah. If Lyra had said five minutes, that would be less impressive, but that beats ten.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie offered, &quot;I can&#039;t sit still for an hour at school. How can any pony actually do that!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity sighed, &quot;Pinkie, I&#039;ve seen you spend three hours watching paint dry, after the cloning incident. For fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, it was boring the first time, but by the end I was really getting into it. It&#039;s like a soap opera, only without the bubbles and singing! Watching paint dry is actually pretty interesting if you watch it happen on a molecular scale.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But... wait, were you doing that baseline?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her head cocked, and she stared down at the counter. For a moment it seemed she was watching the dew accumulating. &quot;You know, I don&#039;t remember.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a silent moment, Twilight said, &quot;All right. Everypony else? Let&#039;s hear &#039;em. You don&#039;t need to beat that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom offered, &quot;Ah&#039;ve been every member of the Apple family there is, and Ah&#039;ve never been able to get through a day of apple bucking without getting covered in tree sap.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo - &quot;You know the bit in Cloud City after Vader&#039;s dinner party where someone, usually Chewbacca, rebuilds Threepio? I&#039;ve never been able to get him functioning with the head on backwards.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon stopped drinking from a shake in a glass that would make Escher&#039;s eyes water. &quot;I was R. Dorothy Wayneright one time. Do you have any idea how hard it is to leap around like she does in the baseline and not have your skirt flip up?&quot;</p><p class="double">That reminded Twilight, and she smiled. &quot;All right, got it. For my own entry... once Pinkie and I replaced Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, respectively. I didn&#039;t find out about this detail until a Hub Loop a long time afterwards, but Mr. Goodwin is an excellent dancer. And I... well... shall I demonstrate?&quot;</p><p class="double">A lot of chairs and stools scooted loudly away from Twilight&#039;s position, not wanting to be inside flail range.</p><p class="double">&quot;All right!&quot; She stopped as the stools scooted back in.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash got up and threw a hoof over her back just to be sure. &quot;I got a better one. Worse one. Still more awesome than most of those you are all fumbling around with. Whatever. You know that stunt from Top Gun where Maverick pulls up and deploys flaps to force the plane chasing him to overshoot? I can never get that to work out properly.&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo comforted her, &quot;Not surprised, Dash. It involves slowing down, which isn&#039;t part of your vocabulary.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash demonstrated that she had no difficulty replicating Grubber&#039;s trademark raspberry.</p><p class="double">Rarity finally said, &quot;Well, mine is a <i>terrible</i> disability. Though it&#039;s a perfectly respectable counter-cultural milieu, I can&#039;t do true Goth chic. If I loop in as a Goth, I have to settle for ironic Goth, reinterpret the wardrobe, or completely replace it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight deadpanned, &quot;Our hearts go out to you. Let&#039;s see if our votes do. And... Fluttershy?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy sighed. &quot;There&#039;s a book I can&#039;t finish.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash chuckled. &quot;Well, if <i>that</i> counts, I&#039;ve got a couple billion.&quot;</p><p class="double">She wailed, &quot;But I <i>want</i> to finish it!&quot; She looked down at the floor. &quot;I can&#039;t. It&#039;s just too sad.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. Well, that&#039;s everyone. Votes for Fluttershy? Rarity? Pinkie? Anypony else? All right.&quot; She marked down the score. &quot;Round eighteen...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.6 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh Awoke in his own bed. That was something of a relief. Waking up in the midst of plowing the south field, where he normally was when Twilight read that one book, wasn&#039;t precisely disorienting, but he often lost momentum on the plow and had to start the furrow again, which was a bit of routine annoyance that he could do without.</p><p class="double">He yawned, stretched, let the sheets flop off, and sat up, looking about for any indication of the time, of day or year. It was warm, without the drafts associated with the baseline farmhouse during winter. The room was lit only by the beams of a setting moon, so it was about time to get up and start doing the chores. The ticking alarm clock on his headboard served to reenforce this impression.</p><p class="double">A &quot;ping&quot; encroached on his mind, that subtle wave of mental hoodoo that was Multiversal for &quot;Anybody awake?&quot;. Mac responded in his own way, a psionic nudge from that one loop in Sharona. Practical folk, for the most part, the Sharonans, and his time as a psychic Voice, a human with empathic Talent, had left just enough of an impression on him that he&#039;d adopted it as his method of pinging back. No way of knowing who was inquiring from that little poke though, aside from that they weren&#039;t in the house, so he&#039;d have the apple and a muffin for postage in Ditzy&#039;s hooves when she came around with the mail.</p><p class="double">Next thing on the agenda was to take stock of Loop Memories. As a later-than-usual start, this was prime opportunity for the Loops to decide to shack the sole looping bachelor up with somepony or other. That was always fun, in the completely sarcastic sense of the word.</p><p class="double">Letting down a Significant Other because you&#039;d looped into their paramour&#039;s body wasn&#039;t easy, and often led to a lot of hurt feelings. Not a problem if they were also Awake, but he didn&#039;t always have that luxury. The non-looping Cheerilee was normally accepting, if a tad harder on the students than usual for a bit. Fluttershy would withdraw into herself until one of the other Elements got her going again. Caramel hadn&#039;t spoken to anypony for the rest of that Loop. Still, it was better than playing along as something he wasn&#039;t.</p><p class="double">So far though, it seemed like his unawake self had kept aloof. There was more than the usual conflict with Twilight over that doll, but nothing noteworthy. Just a bit of yelling out the door and an unofficial game of hide-and-seek with the thing.</p><p class="double">He looked over at the offending object. There it was, lying on the bed in a curled-up bundle, half in and half out of a moonbeam from the window. He&#039;d taken it the first time just to be cheeky, but had become attached to it because it reminded him of simpler times. Back when Applebloom had curled up on top of his back at night, using him as a self-warming sibling-shaped breathing mattress, to fill the hole where a father might have been.</p><p class="double">Since the loops had started, he&#039;d asked for a copy of it from Twilight, and it was one of the few things he would keep in his Pocket. There wasn&#039;t much room in there, but he&#039;d made some.</p><p class="double">Macintosh sighed. Good and bad, those old times, like the loops. Sometimes, all too rarely, they let him relive those old memories, or even make new ones with his parents, in those few blessed opportunities. Other times, they put him through the grief all over again, and while it didn&#039;t sting the same way as it had the first, the dull inevitability of it would saw at his heart each time he had to relive his foalhood days too late to change it.</p><p class="double">A rustling startled Mac from his thoughts. That was close. Too close. Not in his sisters&#039; rooms, down the hall and across the way. Certainly not Granny&#039;s, which was below him. Definitely not his parents&#039;, a dusty memorial which took up most of the rest of the upper floor this loop. It was in the room with him.</p><p class="double">In fact, now that he was listening hard, he could hear the breathing, too light and quiet to hear otherwise.</p><p class="double">He tensed, and he could feel his determination to protect his family coalescing into a green miasma, a distinct awareness of himself, all his components drawing energy from and falling under the sway of his force of will. Every bit, down to the subatomic particles, Twilight had said when she&#039;d applied science to the effect.</p><p class="double">Movement caught the corner of his eye, and he turned to see the dark gray coat, hard to pick out of the shadows without concentrating. The silhouette was further disseminated by the dapples of lighter fur and splotches of different colors. No wonder he hadn&#039;t noticed it.</p><p class="double">Two eyes, one red and one blue, blinked at him out of the darkness, the moonlight glistening off a little filly&#039;s pupils as she uncurled herself from the bundled-up shape she&#039;d been sleeping in, half in and half out of the moonlight.</p><p class="double">&quot;You okay daddy?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fewmets.</p><p class="double">...</p><p class="double">&quot;Daddy, you&#039;re looking at me funny.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh decided, for once, that the chores could wait. This would be dealt with in the light of day, or perhaps the loop would end prematurely, or something. Maybe this loop&#039;s version of himself had hallucinations from time to time. This might just be a dream. It was not outside the realm of possibility that somepony was playing a distinctly tasteless joke. In any case, he had one word for how much he wanted to come to terms with the little one on the edge of his bed. Perhaps it wasn&#039;t grammatically correct, but it was how he wished to respond.</p><p class="double">And so, he flopped back onto the pillow, switched off the alarm, and tried his best to go back to sleep.</p><p class="double">Part of that trying included ignoring the petite hooves clambering up his side, onto his exposed back. An attempt was made to disregard the miniature circle those hooves walked in, turning around after a minute poofy tail that tickled him as it went, before their owner curled up in a small disk of warm, empirically present filly. Further effort was expended to limit the attention paid to the little voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;I love you daddy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Was any of it successful?</p><p class="double">Eenope.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;TWILIGHT TIME!

TWILIGHT TIME! TWILIGHT TIME!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YOOOOOOOooooooou asked for it!&quot; shouted a voice as something slithered out of the hedge. &quot;And now, I, THE NOBLE DISCORD, will deliver!&quot;</p><p class="double">He snapped his talons, and the sun hopped just below the horizon as stars twinkled in the sky.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia sighed. &quot;Discord... the foals were referring to Twilight <i>Sparkle.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But the stars are shimmering in quite a lovely way!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Discord, I meant my student. Former student. The new princess. Bearer of magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">The draconequus tapped his chin thoughtfully. &quot;That&#039;s not ringing a bell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Sorry.&quot; As if on cue, Twilight Sparkle appeared with a black case and a fold out table. &quot;I didn&#039;t mean to be late.&quot; She opened the case and arranged a selection of handbells.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yes, now I remember her!&quot; Discord grinned. &quot;So what you&#039;re saying is that they wanted Twilight to be a clock?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please don&#039;t turn me into a clock,&quot; Twilight asked casually, partway through her rendition of Smile Smile Smile. &quot;I&#039;m already a little cuckoo as is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I did notice you nesting in the library.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia looked between them. &quot;Wait, is this... is this some sort of joke?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My dear Tia, of course not!&quot; Discord spread his arms wide. &quot;Jokes require punchlines, and as you can see there is no punch.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey guys, I brought the punch.&quot; Spike sidled through the door, carrying a bowl of liquid. &quot;I gotta say, I&#039;m surprised there are no lines.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well of course there&#039;s no lines, Spike, this is improv!&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Silly dragon.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.6 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Well, this was a fine kettle of apples and fish, and no mistake.</p><p>Macintosh ambled towards town, the tiny gray filly bouncing around his legs as he went, forcing him to be incredibly careful as to where he put those feet of his. That she insisted on repeating the same words over and over only made it slightly more troublesome.</p><p class="double">He was now quite positive that incident with the filly had not, in fact, been a dream. When he&#039;d woken up, she was still curled up there on his back, clear as day. Which meant he had to actually deal with the situation.</p><p class="double">When he&#039;d awoken, lower case A, a thorough check of his loop memories for an explanation had turned up nothing. It simply wasn&#039;t physically possible for this little bundle of gray to be his offspring. Nor had his non-looping self been interacting with her, so it wasn&#039;t like she&#039;d been adopted. Dabbling in arcane magics that could bring a doll to life was similarly unlikely. That Macintosh would have been just as lost as he was.</p><p class="double">The problem had stumped him.</p><p class="double">The initial best-fit explanation had been a prank. No pings had been returned from inside the house this morning, and none of the other signals they&#039;d worked out between them had been reciprocated, but that only meant none of them chose to respond.</p><p class="double">On the one hoof, Applejack was right out. This wasn&#039;t her style. You didn&#039;t mess with family on this level. Pranks from her would be up-front and very straightforward, like making acid out of potatoes. He&#039;d know an Applejack prank when he saw it, and by then it would be too late. This one, if it was a prank, was a bit too subtle for the elder of his two sisters.</p><p class="double">On the other, Applebloom could have made an android, but that didn&#039;t seem likely. The filly here gave off all the visible indicators of life. More importantly, she felt real. There were androids, and then there were people.</p><p class="double">Macintosh smirked. That had led to an amusing line of thought when he&#039;d first considered the idea. If the filly was one of Applebloom&#039;s creations, his sister would be getting a talking to about making new life without getting married first.</p><p class="double">Living more years, hooey. He was still the first-born, which by his reckoning made him eldest and responsible for that sort of lecture, unless he brought Granny Smith into it. Loops or no loops, there were some traditions that ought to be stuck to, and he&#039;d expect any other Apple to have the same sort of expectations.</p><p class="double">He turned to the little one. She didn&#039;t even look like an Apple. No cutie mark, obviously, but he&#039;d only seen relatives with this diverse and drab a color scheme in gag loops where every pony and their mother was an Apple.</p><p class="double">But no, that was irrelevant. The filly wasn&#039;t discernibly a robot. The explanation for this seemed actually far plainer, between the unusual awakening time, memories devoid of this new individual, and a certain item missing from his room.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d be going to see Twilight regardless, if only to discuss what the anchor had planned, but most the most telling piece of evidence came from the foal&#039;s incessant, squeaky chanting.</p><p class="double">Before that fateful loop, when he&#039;d been discovered, and for a little bit after that, he might have suspected a prank or something more malicious. By now though, having spent a thousand years as her sibling, and more as her friend, he felt he could eliminate that possibility. And it was hardly fair to blame Twilight the Looper for the actions of her un-awake self.</p><p class="double">So onward Mac trudged, the little filly&#039;s incriminating mantra ringing in his ears.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re going to go see mommy, we&#039;re going to go see mommy!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.8 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight again stared at the beaten, battered, and utterly defeated form of King Sombra surrounded by the armed and dangerous citizens of the Crystal Empire. The citizens who, just a few hours prior, were so scared of Sombra that they couldn&#039;t even be coaxed into <i>remembering</i> him. Then she turned to the sheepish looking Fluttershy and the armored mouse perched in her hair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, what just happened?&quot; she asked her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Fluttershy began, &quot;it all started when I met my new friend Mighty here. You see, he wanted a cookie and he looked so cute and sweet and hungry that I decided to give him one...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.6 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The front door of the Ponyville Public Library, as it was known this loop, creaked open at its librarian&#039;s behest to reveal Macintosh Apple and a small filly, gray and blue with white spots and two mismatched eyes.</p><p class="double">“Got a problem Twilight, an&#039; a hunch you might be able to help me with it.”</p><p class="double">He gestured at the little one, who was bouncing up and down beside him on the doorstep.</p><p class="double">Twilight regarded the filly, head cocked curiously. Mac followed his friend&#039;s gaze to the little one, who chirped,</p><p class="double">“Hi mommy!”</p><p class="double">When Mac looked back to the Anchor, her face had shifted to the universally-recognizable unamused-parent-look.</p><p class="double">“Nyxine Sapphire Sparkle, you have ten seconds to explain yourself. You know better than to prank Macintosh without running it by me first.”</p><p class="double">Macintosh mentally kicked himself. He&#039;d forgotten about Nyx. Then the second of Twilight&#039;s sentences hit home, and one of his eyebrows raised. Further comment was cut off by the clap of a teleport, and a whining voice from behind the Anchor.</p><p class="double">“Moooooooooooooooom. You know that&#039;s only my full name some loops.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked from the first filly, who had retreated behind Macintosh&#039;s front legs, to her looping daughter, and back. Her horn began to glow, even as nightmare incarnate continued in a sleepy-sounding ramble.</p><p class="double">“I only just Woke Up, anyway. What&#039;s the big deal? Did Mac open those Klingon spirits I asked him to hold until the next loop with Leman? They were only supposed to go off if Rushie-”</p><p class="double">The small voice was interrupted by a booming pink shockwave that emanated from Twilight&#039;s horn and washed out over the town, sending half of Fluttershy&#039;s animal friends scrambling for cover, deflating Pinkie&#039;s first souffle of the day, dislodging Rarity&#039;s ceiling-high stack of mane care products, inadvertently dropping one in five apples on Applejack&#039;s half of the Acres, and causing Rainbow Dash to turn over and bash her alarm clock, which for once didn&#039;t deserve it. Its only effect on both ponies on the doorstep was to muss their manes a bit. Twilight observed this, and gave voice to a two-word comment.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Ginko.”</p><p class="double">Macintosh raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">“What was that supposed ta do?”</p><p class="double">He could see his friend going into lecture mode, even as she looked the filly over.</p><p class="double">“That was a wide-angle illusion, mirror duplicate and shadow clone disruptor. It only dispels the really simple glamours, but it should have at least made her flicker.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up and addressed him.</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s flesh and blood, isn&#039;t she.”</p><p class="double">Macintosh may have been fooled thus far, but figured it couldn&#039;t hurt to double check. He took a forehoof and gently booped the filly, which got a giggle. Still seemed pretty solid.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">“Well, that explains what my unawake self was doing with Shelle&#039;s Spelle Booke until four in the morning. Apparently in this variant it&#039;s possible to pull a full-fledged Pinocchio gambit if you have the right cantrips and enough pow-”</p><p class="double">“Eeek!”</p><p class="double">All four ponies were distracted by a clearly-terrified changeling tearing its way across the square, followed closely by a large-eyed, grinning and evidently unawake Lyra, whose cries echoed in the still-sleepy village streets.</p><p class="double">“IknewyouwererealIknewitIknewitIknewit!”</p><p class="double">The two adults remained transfixed for a moment. Macintosh instinctively covered the filly&#039;s ears, as the chittering from a panicked changeling did not bear repeating, but Twilight was the first to more-or-less recover.</p><p class="double">“Should we-”</p><p class="double">“Ah&#039;m not sure.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked up from waving at the filly behind Macintosh&#039;s legs.</p><p class="double">“Nah. She&#039;ll be fine, from what my memories as an existential concept tell me, Lyra&#039;s just obsessed with general cryptology this loop. Even if she does catch Bon-bon, the worst that&#039;ll happen is a net, an involved discussion of biology, some light petting, and coffee.”</p><p class="double">Macintosh blinked. That sounded plausible, if a little specific. He remained transfixed by the odd sight, at least until a quiet rumbling emanated from somewhere near his foot. Twilight smiled.</p><p class="double">“Why don&#039;t you come in, and we&#039;ll discuss this over breakfast.”</p><p class="double">Mac nodded. His friend&#039;s suggestion was a good one. The sooner this was straightened out, the better, and food could only help. Twilight gave a slightly harried look, and then turned in the direction of the tree&#039;s kitchen.</p><p class="double">“Hey Spike! Mix batter for another batch of pancakes, we&#039;ve got guests!”</p><p class="double">Macintosh stepped to follow, but found his other hoof wrapped in diminutive female.</p><p class="double">“Daddy, why was mommy angry? Did I do something wrong?”</p><p class="double">The wide, mismatched doe-eyes dredged up old memories again, of a little yellow one who&#039;d curled possessively around his leg like that after a thunderclap or a creak from the house settling on its foundation. Mac shook his head, in an attempt to both reassure the filly and shove the association aside.</p><p class="double">“She weren&#039;t angry, just surprised. Weren&#039;t nothing you did, or she did. We&#039;re just gonna have a bit of a talk. Now come on, we wouldn&#039;t wanna miss the pancakes, now would we.”</p><p class="double">A miniscule pink tongue licked at grey lips, the whole head shook back and forth rapidly, and its owner dashed inside. The clatter of tiny hooves was drowned out and interrupted as Bon-bon&#039;s panicked chittering went by in another direction.</p><p class="double">&quot;Daddy, what&#039;s a fewmet?&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac sighed, and pulled the door closed behind him. Just when he thought this loop was making sense.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Now, Scrapper, remember: most ponies are a little more delicate than you, so try to be careful around the other foals.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay Momma.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And if you have any questions or trouble, just come to me--&quot; Apple Bloom cut herself off as she came in sight of the schoolhouse and spotted a familiar purple pony. &quot;Howdy miss Cheerilee! Could ya come over here for a sec?&quot;</p><p class="double">The schoolmarm smiled as she turned to look at her student. &quot;Oh, hello Apple <i>what.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah....&quot; Apple Bloom coughed awkwardly. &quot;This is Scrapper. Long story short, a bit o&#039; construction equipment touched an alien box and bing bang zoom Ah&#039;ve adopted tha biggest metal child ya&#039;ve ever seen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Momma loves me.&quot; Scrapper smiled happily at the still blank-faced Cheerilee. &quot;That&#039;s a good thing!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awwwww.&quot; The yellow filly nuzzled the giant robot&#039;s ankle. &quot;Ain&#039;t he a charmer?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...quite,&quot; Cheerilee managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;See, tha thing is, Ah&#039;m kinda still a filly and all. Ah mean Ah&#039;m getting help from Macintosh, but... well, there&#039;s school and getting ta play with other foals...&quot; Apple Bloom twirled a hoof. &quot;Ah was wondering if he could sit in on class today, just as a test you know?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... don&#039;t know if he&#039;ll fit into the building,&quot; Cheerilee pointed out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it&#039;s a nice day. Maybe we could hold class outdoors?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee bit her lip, looking into the innocently smiling face of a robot six times her size. &quot;...weeeeeell. We can try it for a week, I suppose, but I should probably send for some... homeschooling material.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.6 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The pancakes had been delicious.</p><p class="double">It was a small thing, unsurprising really. Spike was a decent cook, even when he wasn&#039;t Awake, and pancakes were hardly the pinnacle of culinary difficulty. Macintosh relished the normalcy of that fact nonetheless. By the looks of things, normal was going to be in short supply this loop. Just now, for instance, he was resting on a couch in Twilight Sparkle&#039;s library, watching two fillies at play. Not all that unusual, until you considered the fillies&#039; origins.</p><p class="double">One was the Spirit of Darkness incarnate, adopted as a daughter by the most powerful entity in Mac&#039;s universe, who also happened to be his friend occupying the easy chair, watching as well.</p><p class="double">“So she says her name is Smarty Pants?”</p><p class="double">“Eeyup.”</p><p class="double">The other, up until the wee hours of last night, had been a doll that his unawake self had stolen from said entity, and that he himself kept around in a bit of nowhere he&#039;d carved out.</p><p class="double">“I realize this is my unawake self&#039;s fault. If you like, I can have her stay here at the library. It&#039;ll practically be a baseline loop for you.”</p><p class="double">You could tell it by looking. The little one giggling on the floor being tickled had the same matted mane and tail, like strings of yarn sewed into a plush. Hindquarters were both unmarked, but still bore the telltale dark blue patches and white spots.</p><p class="double">“Reversing the spell is, of course, out of the question.”</p><p class="double">Yet, the reality of the filly was equally undeniable. Her boundless energy, little legs pinwheeling as she raced around the spacious library after Nyx, the glimmer in those mismatched eyes, each was as real as in any of the youngsters Macintosh had ever seen. This was a real little pony, one that considered him her father.</p><p class="double">“&#039;course. But she&#039;ll stay with me. Y&#039;all&#039;ve got enough on yer plate.”</p><p class="double">There was responsibility and duty there, and emotion was tied up in it too, but he could also sense a feeling there, deeper than morality or simple psychology. Love was a familiar bond. A bond with something that would be gone in a few years when the world reset. Not replaced by a younger version with no memories of the intervening time, just gone. And, despite rhyme or reason, he could feel himself caring.</p><p class="double">It was going to hurt.</p><p class="double">“So how do y&#039;all deal with it? Ah mean, ah&#039;ve dealt with mah sisters resetting. Never had a kid before. Suppose Ditzy or Berry would know too, on account of their baseline, but you&#039;ve been awake the most out of all of us...”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s... Well, I think those mares have it worse in a way, with kids that are unawake. Nyx is really only &#039;here&#039; when she&#039;s Awake. I&#039;ve only felt I lost her the once.”</p><p class="double">The two little ones streaked by in a blur, batting a ball back and forth in a game with no particular rhyme or reason to it.</p><p class="double">“Sometimes, the loops have given me children besides Nyx. When they&#039;re not somepony Awake, I do my best.”</p><p class="double">She giggled, and Macintosh thought he heard an echo in Smarty Pants&#039; laugh.</p><p class="double">“I have a whole album of Celestia and Luna as rambunctious little fillies. Times like that, they&#039;re something to remember.”</p><p class="double">The two little ones flopped in the middle of the library, apparently exhausted from the activity. After a few moments though, the crayons came out, and some helpless coloring book found itself victim to a haphazard rainbow of wax.</p><p class="double">“Just enjoy the time you get together, be the best you can for them, and then treasure the memories. That&#039;s all normal parents get to do with their kids anyway.”</p><p class="double">He nodded. That was what he&#039;d done for each of the innumerable versions of his sisters and grandmother. Treasure, help, remember, and try to do better next time.</p><p class="double">“Dddr?”</p><p class="double">Mac looked down. His daughter was sitting on the floor in front of him, holding a rolled-up piece of paper. He took it and unrolled it on one of the couch&#039;s arms.</p><p class="double">The sheet had been vigorously inundated with colored wax, but there were discernible shapes in the chaos. Mostly in that in the middle there was an area that was largely red and orange, another that was predominantly gray and blue, a third made up of purple and pink, and a final one that was black and purple. Green festooned the top of the paper, and a brown region extended down into a second area of green. The bottom was a light blue, with a large yellow circle dominating the bottom right corner.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s you, me, mommy, and Nyx!”</p><p class="double">Macintosh turned the picture so that it was rightways-up. Well, that at least made a little more sense.</p><p class="double">“You like it?”</p><p class="double">He made a note to ask Twilight for one of those albums. Maybe later though, when there wasn&#039;t any water in his eyes.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.10 (AnonymousAsk/fractalman collaboration)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx and Sweetie Belle made puppy dog eyes at each-other, surrounded by several unconscious adults...including Princess Celestia.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe Twilight can help us decide?&quot; queried Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, let&#039;s go find mommy!&quot; replied Nyx.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, Twilight!&quot; panted Applebloom, &quot;Ya gotta help, Nyx and Sweetie...well ya gotta stop &#039;em!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stop them from what, Applebloom?&quot;</p><p class="double">Just then, Nyx and Sweetie showed up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Momma, momma! I&#039;m the cutest, right?&quot; said Nyx.</p><p class="double">&quot;No I&#039;m the cutest!&quot; pouted Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, girls?&quot; asked Twilight, who made the mistake of looking straight at the power of puppy-dog eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please mommy, please tell me I&#039;m the cutest!&quot; whined Nyx</p><p class="double">&quot;I know she&#039;s your daughter, but you gotta remain impartial! I&#039;m the cutest!&quot; demanded Sweetie.</p><p class="double">The cuteness was too much, and Twilight Sparkle collapsed.</p><p class="double">The two fillies looked at each other. </p><p class="double">&quot;You think Discord will be able to withstand our cuteness?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.11 (Gamerex27)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in a laboratory set up in her tree&#039;s basement, soldering a final wire into a colossal machine. According to her Loop memories this time around, she had been working on a magical telescope shaped suspiciously like the Hubble, and she had just made the final step in getting it functional.</p><p class="double">A quick ping, followed by an element check, confirmed that the only other pony Awake was most likely Applejack. In fact, the ping came from very close by-</p><p class="double">THOOM.</p><p class="double">The earth shook, and Twilight briefly flew into the air from the massive tremors. &quot;What the hay was that?!&quot;</p><p class="double">THOOM. THOOM. THOOM. THOOM.</p><p class="double">The impacts repeated at regular intervals, almost as if they were hoofsteps. As she walked up the stairs, Twilight could already hear the entire town panicking, followed by the telltale thunder of a stampede. Which was still drowned out by whatever was making those tremors.</p><p class="double">THOOM. THOOM. THOOM. THOOM.</p><p class="double">CRAAAAASH!</p><p class="double">The door was sent flying off its hinges by a massive impact. Without even thinking, Twilight conjured a shield into existence, and the shrapnel and splinters bounced harmlessly off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops,&quot; said a voice which came from outside. Odd, considering that no one was at the door. &quot;Sorry, sugarcube.&quot;</p><p class="double">Hesitantly, Twilight sent out another Ping, and was answered by an echo mere feet away. &quot;Applejack? What&#039;s going on? Where are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Squinting, she could see the faint blue-ish outline of a pony standing on her front porch. The Element of Honesty rubbed her head sheepishly with a hoof. &quot;Sorry. Ah Woke up like this, and Ah fell right through ta the mantle. Ah&#039;ve been using all my Earthbending ta get back up and make sure Ah don&#039;t fall through the ground again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Must be another Gag Loop,&quot; the Anchor sighed. &quot;But what could cause..wait there a moment.&quot;</p><p class="double">In a flash of light, Twilight teleported out of sight, and returned seconds later with the telescope. Wheeling it out the doorhole, she aimed it at the stars and adjusted the lenses to focus on a specific point. One cast of a spell to help the telescope see in the day, and she found what she was looking for.</p><p class="double">She looked out towards Applejack&#039;s outline, then back in the telescope, then back again. She sighed again, comprehension dawning on her face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, for whatever reason, it looks like you&#039;re made out of dark matter in this Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great. How am Ah supposed&#039;ta buck apples if Ah break everythin&#039; Ah touch?&quot; A sigh came from the outline, and it flopped onto the ground, making a massive crater at the point of impact. &quot;Ah wish Mac was Awake. Ah need some cider, now.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.12 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Ho hum...another baseline loop</i>, thought Twilight as she and Spike disembarked from the chariot in Ponyville. She didn&#039;t have anything planned and was going more or less on autopilot until inspiration struck. Her element scan had picked up one Kindness, and she absently wondered if any of that trio had anything interesting in the works.</p><p class="double">Near the outskirts of the town, on the way to Sweet Apple Acres, she was approached by an ill-at-ease Bonbon.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me? You&#039;re Twilight Sparkle, right?&quot; asked the cream-coated earth pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I am. Can I help you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah...I&#039;m Bonbon and...Um...Aren&#039;t you supposed to be a princess?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; <i>Oh bark. I hope that doesn&#039;t mean what I think it does...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Just that I remember you giving the town a tour of your new palace a few days back, and then I woke up this morning to find no gigantic crystalline tree, the library back to normal, and you arriving in a Royal Canterlot chariot.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Huh. Well, I suppose Lyra might be happy about this, and Pinkie&#039;d certainly be delighted to throw a &quot;Yay! New Equestrian Looper!&quot; party.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What is she talking about, Twilight?&quot; asked Spike. &quot;Do you know her?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Okay. I need to distract Spike so I can get a private word with the newbie.</i></p><p class="double">Turning back to Bonbon, she said, &quot;Look. I think I know what&#039;s happening, but it will take some time to explain. Can you meet me at the library in about ten minutes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess so.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn made an about-face and started back toward Town Hall. <i>Rarity, please forgive me for this afternoon...</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fifteen minutes into the &quot;Welcome to the Multiverse&quot; presentation, the small nagging feelings that had been building up finally crystallized into a solid suspicion. &quot;You&#039;re taking this amazingly calmly,&quot; Twilight observed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Am I?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Are you sure you&#039;ve never been exposed to this material before?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s just that most newbies I show this material to express more shock or disbelief.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You, on the other hoof, seem just a tad bored, as if you&#039;re not only familiar with the topic, but have seen this specific presentation before.&quot; The unicorn fired off a low-powered spell.</p><p class="double">&quot;Drat. You got me,&quot; admitted the now exposed Chrysalis. &quot;So much for that spur-of-the-moment prank.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t feel too bad. You did get me to ditch Spike and start the lecture, after all. If you did this without any prep work, it was a very good try.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d hoped to make it to the end of the presentation at least.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;know. If you want to try this again, I&#039;m willing to help. I have this idea about waiting for Celestia, Rarity and maybe Luna to be Awake. Then at the Grand Galloping Gala, you can play a confused Blueblood...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.13 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke to a thin sliver of light. She tried widening her eyes and found she couldn&#039;t. She tried moving closer to the light, and while the pattern of colors and gradients changed, it grew no wider. She tried reaching out with a foreleg and found she had none to speak of.</p><p class="double">Then the Loop memories hit, and had she been able to, T. Square would&#039;ve facehoofed. &quot;Oh. Flatland. And this either a Variant or a gender swap, given that I&#039;m not a line segment.&quot;</p><p class="double">She… yes, yes she was a she. In any case, she oscillated about her center, for lack of a head to shake. &quot;Alright. So long as I don&#039;t write something questioning the orthodoxy of two-dimensional space, this should be fairly interesting.&quot; She sent off a ping and noted that it seemed to fading much more slowly than usual. &quot;I suppose the inverse-square law is just an inverse law here, isn&#039;t it? Well, that&#039;s a discovery already!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight reflexively tried to pull a notebook out of her pocket, only to shudder as it jammed against the edge of the subspace. &quot;What the… Of course. Trying to pull a 3D object into 2D space isn&#039;t going to work well. Guess I&#039;ll just have to remember everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sure you can handle it, Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Anchor spun, trying to find the source of the other voice. &quot;Hello?&quot;</p><p class="double">A bright dot appeared in Twilight&#039;s vision, then began to expand. The gradual dimming along its edges suggested a circle. An inexplicably expanding circle. And with that voice… &quot;Let me guess. Spherelestia?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Got it in one. Care to go on a tour? I think the king of Pointland may be Loop-aware.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled as best as anatomy and geometry allowed her. &quot;Sounds like fun to me!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.14 (Gamerex27)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, what happens in this Loop?&quot; Rarity looked around at the vast city of Tokyo, scowling slightly as that tacky headphones&#039; cord got in her line of sight.</p><p class="double">&quot;In a few hours, demons start invading the city like crazy,&quot; replied Atsuro, the Anchor of the Lockdown Amala Loop. &quot;People can use these COMPS,&quot; he said, holding up a device that looked suspiciously like a Nintendo 3DS, &quot;to summon and control them. Then the military locks down the whole city.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity could take it no longer: she tore those accursed headphones off of her head, dropping them to the ground. &quot;Is there any way to cut this short?&quot; she asked. &quot;I think I felt my sister&#039;s Element, and I want to track her down before she gets into any trouble.&quot;</p><p class="double">Atsuro grimaced at this. &quot;Then she&#039;s probably replacing Naoya-that&#039;s the older brother of my buddy you&#039;re replacing. He&#039;s the reincarnation of Cain, and he made the Summoning Program as part of this gambit to get revenge against God.&quot; He removed a drone from his Pocket, tweeting a command to it through his COMP. It flew off, presumably in search of Sweetie. &quot;To stop the lockdown, you have to beat all the Bel demons, and then kill Babel to become the King of Bel. Otherwise, the whole city gets destroyed, since that&#039;s the only way to get rid of the lockdown. Well, the <i>best</i> way: Yooho gets mad when we take the more unorthodox methods, since they lead to more explosions.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity quirked her (thankfully real this time) eyebrow. &quot;Bels?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re a bunch of demons that were the pieces of this big demon, killed thousands of years ago. They&#039;ve all got Bel in their name, and whichever one kills all the other Bels can become the King.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, Rarity groaned, holding her head in her hands.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; Atsuro asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know why I&#039;m here now,&quot; Rarity groaned. &quot; It&#039;s <i>another </i>Gag Loop. My full name is Rarity <i>Belle</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Anchor tried to stifle his laughter, and failed. &quot;Yeah, that would explain it,&quot; he said after composing himself. &quot;You&#039;re replacing Kazuya, who&#039;s the reincarnation of Abel, and since he&#039;s a Bel...&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity <b>Bel</b>le sighed again, facepalming. If only she could Ascend this Loop to just end it now. This was going to become annoying. Especially if she couldn&#039;t find anything better to wear than the mind-numbingly plain clothes the Loop saw fit to put her in. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">115.15 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was contentedly humming to herself as she went over the pile of checklists in front of her. They took up quite a lot of counter space at the bar, but as she telekinetically moved them out of the way whenever Mac needed, he couldn&#039;t complain. After an hour of this, Mac decided to act on his growing curiosity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Planning something?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a moment to blink before remembering where she was.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, just trying to figure out future drinking game rounds for the next loop when everypony is Awake,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I like having some ideas on standby, but I think we might have done all the obvious ones. And these ones are kind of...well...&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac accepted the list that Twilight hoofed him and read it.</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re mostly too simple or boring,&quot; Twilight finished.</p><p class="double">That was true, the list included several very simple ideas: &#039;Most Unusual Color&#039;, &#039;Shortest-and/or-Longest Loop Duration&#039;, and so on. Not that a group of happily drunk ponies wouldn&#039;t enjoy these rounds of the game as much as the others, but Twilight clearly wasn&#039;t satisfied.</p><p class="double">Mac spotted the title of another checklist as he hoofed this one back, and it raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Bad Ideas&#039;?&quot; he asked, taking a look at that one next.</p><p class="double">Reading the list raised Mac&#039;s other eyebrow as well. &#039;Most Issues When Replacing Pinkie Pie&#039;? &#039;Most Unsuccessful Loop&#039;? &#039;Worst Loop Visited Aside From Eiken?&#039; Enope, not the best ideas here. Though one or two had a <i>little</i> promise.</p><p class="double">&quot;What about this one?&quot; Mac asked, pointing at one further down the list.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Most Practical Power From A Fused Loop&#039; is too subjective,&quot; Twilight replied, &quot;I mean, for Sunset it&#039;s probably her Keyblade, for Spike it would have to be the Force, for other ponies it might be even more basic things like magic or chakra. I suppose if I specified it to be a <i>minor</i> power, then maybe...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight trailed off. Mac had pulled a bottle of apple cider out from below the bar, and was staring at it. Then, with a sudden glow of his eyes, the cap of the bottle popped off. Mac proceeded to pour the cider into a glass, only noticing Twilight&#039;s bemused expression when he passed the drink to her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Got that from a loop as &#039;Strong Mac&#039;,&quot; Mac admitted, sounding a tad sheepish, &quot;Only works t&#039;open bottles, so there&#039;s no use for it outside the bar.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, then quietly crossed &#039;Most Practical Power&#039; off the list entirely. Back to the drawing board... </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>116.1 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...And I know for absolute certain, that everything...&quot; The purple pony on the screen sang. Gloaming Glimmer softly sang along with herself, still thinking about what happened at the convention that afternoon. Was this really her life? Was she just a washed-up actress, from a beloved, but cancelled, show? Did she really have nothing else?</p><p class="double">&quot;Pegasus body double wasn&#039;t even close to my body shape.&quot; She muttered, as she opened a new bottle. &quot;Had to wear that silly dress to cover it up.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up, in multiple meanings of the term, on her living room floor. Her name this loop was Gloaming Glimmer, she had a hangover, there were empty bottles on her table, and somepony was knocking on the window.</p><p class="double">Looking up, Twilight flinched at the light streaming in. As she tried to cast a hangover cure, she could just barely make out a white pony standing on her patio. The pony gestured to her door.</p><p class="double">Somehow staggering across the room, Twilight opened the door, now recognizing the frowning face of her friend. &quot;Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Gloamy...&quot; Twilight noticed she didn&#039;t speak with Rarity&#039;s accent. The mare, her memories now giving the correct name of Crystal Song, stepped up to hug her. &quot;Gloamy, I&#039;m sorry none of us followed you after you blew up yesterday. Judging by the smell, you could have used a friend last night.&quot;</p><p class="double">Moving to her side, Crystal started helping Twilight walk towards the kitchen. Moving inside, away from the painful light, Twilight stopped squinting so much, and saw more differences between Crystal and Rarity. The most noticeable was how she wore her mane, a short braid that barely reached her shoulder.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re lucky I decided to drop by early, we still have a couple hours until that throwaway job. Here, take a seat, let&#039;s get you sobered up a bit, kk?&quot; Setting her at the kitchen table, Crystal set a glass of water in front of her, then set about nosing through her kitchen.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re all worried about you, Gloamy.&quot; She addressed Twilight, pulling out a pot and a container of oatmeal. &quot;Even setting aside that we didn&#039;t go after you yesterday, we&#039;ve been worried you&#039;re starting to slip into a real funk.&quot; The pot on the stove, water heating, she turned to look at Twilight directly. &quot;So I was thinking, after this gig Bright Eyes got us, how about we cut the autographs short, and go out somewhere? Just the seven of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">Crystal looked down, with a sad smile. &quot;Heh, if that silly drake was still alive, it&#039;d almost be like old times.&quot;</p><p class="double">They didn&#039;t talk much after that. Aside from a reply ping, Twilight&#039;s breakfast quietly passed by.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Take it from us, we&#039;ve been all over Equestria.&quot; Crystal Song said, smiling out to the crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;But we&#039;ve never seen such wonderiffic values as we&#039;ve seen here, at...&quot; Surprise continued, exactly on cue as usual.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tech Value Electronics Superstore!&quot; Twilight finished.</p><p class="double">There was a moment of silence, before Crystal nudged Prism. With a distinctly unenthused voice, she said her line. &quot;This store is at least twenty percent cooler.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...I mean, I get that it&#039;s <i>my line</i>, but seriously, do I <i>have</i> to use it every time?&quot; The blue pegasus griped, as they walked down the road.</p><p class="double">As it turned out, Bright Eyes, one of the show&#039;s writers, had been Ditzy. The rest of her friends, who were the actors that played her friends, were an interesting bunch.</p><p class="double">&quot;I kinda know the feeling, Pris. I mean, everypony expects me to do all this wacky stuff, not knowing that I had CG, bluescreens, and about twenty stage hands to pull it off.&quot; Surprise was strange to Twilight, in that she was almost normal; a Pinkie Pie that obeyed the laws of physics.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s yer own fault for ad-libbin&#039; that line, Wings.&quot; Posey, meanwhile, was nothing like the character she portrayed. A cheerful, outgoing mare, a nickname for everypony on the show. Like Crystal, she used a different &#039;voice&#039; in character, and sounded almost as country as AJ out of it.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, staying silent in the back of the group was Velvet Apple, B-list actor by day, persimmon farmer by weekend. Like Pinkie, she was very close to the pony Twilight knew. Originally brought in by a writer for insight into farm life, she ended up as Applejack after test-reading a few lines for her friend in front of the right pony.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hours later, the seven of them sat around a table at some pub Crystal knew about. They had eaten dinner, then just spent their time drinking and reminiscing about, as Prism put it, that time they all had jobs.</p><p class="double">In a lull in the conversation, Ditzy caught Twilight&#039;s attention, before giving her a wink. At least, she thought that was what it was. Hard to tell, sometimes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Say, there&#039;s something I&#039;ve been meaning to bring up.&quot; Ditzy addressed the table. &quot;Just say, if we <i>could</i> get funding for a season four, would you do it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Before anypony could answer, the lights flickered. &quot;Hm? Hope the power don&#039;t go out, be annoying to get through my apartment in the dark.&quot; Posey turned her attention back to the table.&quot; Anyway, I think I&#039;d-&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>CRACK</b></p><p class="double">Everything went dark. All the sound around them, the background noise of the crowded pub, all cut out, just for a moment. Then, they were back in the pub.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wh-what was that?&quot; Prism asked, wide-eyed and clearly rattled.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t kn-&quot; Twilight had started to say as she stood, only to be interrupted by it happening again.</p><p class="double"><b>CRACK</b></p><p class="double">Once again, they were in the void. The unicorns lit their horns, checking on everypony at the table, before trying to make out their surroundings. Aside from the table, chairs, and even the floor of the pub, the world around them seemed to be an empty void.</p><p class="double">&quot;Does anypony feel that wind?&quot; Velvet asked, prodding the void with her chair.</p><p class="double">Twilight tried to feel where this wind came from, even going so far as to flick her tail over the edge of the platform. &quot;It&#039;s coming from below us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s a light down there.&quot; Ditzy, meanwhile, had just stuck her head off the edge, while everypony was watching Twilight.</p><p class="double">Seeing Ditzy had kept her head, they all ended up taking peeks of various lengths. In the far distance below them was a pinprick of light, swiftly growing larger. While Ditzy kept watch, the six of them tried to come up with a plan.</p><p class="double">Well, Twilight tried to come up with a plan, the others were in various states of panic, save for Surprise. Surprise had just gone back to the table, to finish her drink.</p><p class="double">Planning, panicking, and panicked planning, were all cut short when Ditzy dove for the table shouting. &quot;Brace for impact!&quot;</p><p class="double">Most of them had enough time to process what she had said, before everything went white.</p><p class="double"><b>CRACK</b></p><p class="double">As their vision cleared, they found themselves in a cave. Surrounding their patch of pub, was a massive hexagram, carved into the stone. Different places were inscribed with words, though they couldn&#039;t make them out from where they stood.</p><p class="double">What they could make out, in the torchlight, were the dozens of robe-wearing ponies staring at them.</p><p class="double">It was Posey that broke the silence. &quot;Well, that&#039;s a whole new set of problems, innit?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">116.2 (FanOfMostEverything)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The entrance to Golden Oaks slammed shut. Twilight galloped up the basement stairs to see why.</p><p class="double">There she beheld a furious Rarity, face flushing, tail lashing, and horn sparking. &quot;That, that...&quot; Rarity gave a noise that was part scream, part groan. &quot;THAT!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight carefully approached her, making no sudden moves. &quot;Talk to me, Rarity. That what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity heaved a few deep breaths in and out before she could compose herself enough to respond. In a voice far more collected than her expression, she asked, &quot;Do you remember our last Loop together, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... You mean the one where we just played mental chess?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity boggled at Twilight for a moment. &quot;The one where we played mental chess. That&#039;s what stood out to you? The chess?&quot;</p><p class="double">This got a shrug. &quot;Not the first time I&#039;ve been a nebula.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, well.&quot; Rarity&#039;s voice adopted a sweetness on the edge of sanity. &quot;Do you recall what I was, perchance?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;A supermassive black hole. Good thing telepathy doesn&#039;t care about gravity, huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And did you perhaps share this fact with our other Awake friends at some point?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I thought it was interrRainbow Dash made fun of you, didn&#039;t she?&quot; Twilight groaned. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, Rarity, I didn&#039;t even think about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a problem, not a problem!&quot; Rarity&#039;s pupils had contracted to pinpricks. &quot;I&#039;m sure one day in the far, far future, when she calls me &#039;Singurarity,&#039; I will join in her laughter. Now, if you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;m going to go dust off my weather magic.&quot; She pranced off, head held high.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. There was really only one appropriate reaction to this. &quot;Losing a friend&#039;s trust is the fastest way to lose a friend—&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;FOREVER!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, Pinkie.&quot; Easiest summoning ritual she ever learned. &quot;I need you to tell Fluttershy, Lyra, Sweetie Belle, Silver Spoon, and the mayor that we have a Code Prank Prism.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie saluted. &quot;You can count on me!&quot; She zipped back into the drawer from which she&#039;d emerged.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. Unawake Pinkie, almost as good as dragon mail. At least now the other Loopers would be properly warned. Things would be getting messy soon enough... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">116.3 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Are you sure we should be doing this?&quot; Rarity asked miserably as they left the library.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah ain&#039;t one to shirk work that needs doin&#039;,&quot; Applejack answered in not-quite-a-whisper. &quot;Somepony needs ta save the Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s right,&quot; Twilight rasped. &quot;Right now we&#039;re Equestria&#039;s best hope.&quot; <i>Not to mention that a dose of Harmony will leave us all feeling a lot better than we are now,</i> she added to herself.</p><p class="double">It was a Lonely Loop and seemed to be baseline save for the persistent cold that had swept the nation just before the Summer Sun Celebration. The bug was at least partially magical, and had thus far withstood her every attempt to cure it. She hadn&#039;t tried ascending yet, but she was tempted to give it a shot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wanna go bed...&quot; Rainbow whined, dragging her hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheer up, Dashy, an adven-&quot; Pinky&#039;s typical cheer was interrupted by a sudden coughing fit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh dear...&quot; Fluttershy said, even more quietly than usual.</p><p class="double">&quot;Girls, we&#039;ll be <i>fine</i>,&quot; the Anchor insisted. &quot;We&#039;re all just a little hoarse.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">116.4 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><b>No Need For Applejack (GXP)</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A high school girl sat on a road embankment staring at a rice field, carefully pulling her thoughts together.</p><p class="double">The other locals passing by on the local road above knew her as Fujiringo Yoshiko, human, a farm girl helping her aunt and uncle on their Okayama rice farm while the rest of her family grew apples up north in Aoyama. But inside her own head she had another name, a name that meant countless years of experience on multiple worlds, thanks to time loops and a wonky computer-tree-thing messing up all imaginable time and space.</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed, letting Loop memories assimilate as she sent out another ping. Twilight Sparkle would have pinged first, had she been in the Loop. The others would have answered her first ping immediately, if Awake. Even a number of the more frequent visitors to Equestrian loops would have sensed the signal and responded. Nobody responded. There was nobody to respond, unless they were stealth Loopers like the Star Trek Loopers.</p><p class="double">There had to be an Anchor somewhere in this universe; otherwise Applejack wouldn&#039;t be here at all. A world required an Anchor to Loop- a single individual, usually critical to the history at the point time looped, with above-average mental and physical stability and prowess. These people remembered every single iteration of a Loop, except when they were accidentally placed in another world&#039;s Loop. Anchors somehow dragged other people into the Loops with them, Awakening them and allowing them to remember some- but not all- of their own Loops.</p><p class="double">Applejack had been the first Equestrian to join Twilight Sparkle as a Looper, but she wasn&#039;t an Anchor and never would be. Twilight was the Anchor. Twilight was always there. Always- well, almost always, but even when Twilight wasn’t Awake and some visiting Anchor was taking her place, there was a Twilight.</p><p class="double">How long ago, how many Loops, had it been since the last time she was the only Equestrian in a Loop? How long since the last time she Looped without Twilight Sparkle? <i>There was that time... no, wait, Twilight showed up later then... or maybe, um, no, Twilight had been there too, come to think...maybe that Doctor Who- no, Twilight had been the TARDIS, even if she hadn&#039;t realized it at the time. Well, how about- no... Wait, there was the time- no, no, I forgot, then too...</i></p><p class="double">Ah. <i>Then</i>. An Eiken Loop she&#039;d shared with the Evangelion Loopers. And that had been... at least two thousand Loops ago, she guessed. Probably more. Before that...</p><p class="double">Applejack tried to concentrate, tried to remember all her Loops, despite how many of them basically repeated the same baseline events over, over, <i>over, over</i> and <b>over</b> again. That Eiken Loop, the Star Wars Loop where she and Twilight had awakened half a galaxy apart (and she&#039;d become an alicorn after magically terraforming Tatooine)... and her visit to the world of the Avatars and learned earthbending. Those were, so far as she could remember, the only Loops where she&#039;d spent any significant length of time without Twilight Sparkle either next to her or in easy reach. Twilight had just always... <i>been there.</i></p><p class="double">Or... wait... or was it, that <i>Applejack</i> was always there?</p><p class="double">Yes. Good ol&#039; Applejack. Good ol&#039; dependable Applejack. Willing to go along with practically anything Applejack. Seldom having new ideas of her own Applejack. Seldom having new <i>adventures </i>of her own Applejack. Twilight helped break in new Loopers. Pinkie Pie bent even magical laws of nature into candy-coated pretzels. Rainbow Dash could achieve faster-than-light speeds without a ship. Fluttershy communed with nature more closely than any earth pony, even Applejack. Rarity and Spike had become the first Loopers to marry outside of baseline.</p><p class="double">And Applejack? Oh, she was there, too.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d never really looked at it like that before. There had always been farm chores, family, and friends to keep her time filled. Earthbending came in extremely useful on the farm, and alicorn powers were a handy cheat now and again, but that&#039;s all she&#039;d used them for- tools to make life a little easier. The other girls came up with the ideas, the adventures. Applejack just followed along, helped out, and did the work.</p><p class="double">All of them were stuck in the Loops, but Applejack, she now realized, was the only one stuck in a rut. Her friends had grown... and she hadn&#039;t. She&#039;d missed the opportunities, taken the easy way out, followed the others&#039; lead. Take away the skills and powers learned or earned in the Loops, and Applejack was still the same farm pony whose baseline self kept thinking of helping other ponies, never seeking anything for herself.</p><p class="double">Now there weren&#039;t any others to follow.</p><p class="double"><i>What do I do now?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Well, think, pony. I&#039;m a public school student in southern Japan. It&#039;s the end of summer vacation. School resumes in two days. I could go back to school, take my university admission exams in a year and a half, go on to college, and do whatever else Yoshiko or whoever was meant to do in baseline until the Loop ends. </i></p><p class="double"><i>I could do that, but I won&#039;t, because I&#039;ve done the Japanese schoolgirl thing many times before, even not counting Eiken, and nobody should. I could take the exams right now and earn a perfect score minus whatever changes in history this Loop throws at me while fighting alien ninja ghosts from fairyland in a martial arts tournament. I refuse to do it again. </i></p><p class="double"><i>I could quit school and go back to, yes, my granny and brother and sister up north, and spend yet another Loop applebuckin&#039;. Up to five minutes ago that would have seemed like a mighty fine plan. Now... now I kinda do and don&#039;t want to do it. After all, even if they&#039;re not Awake, they&#039;re family, and- </i></p><p class="double"><i>No. They&#039;re not Awake, and that&#039;s what matters. Nobody else from my Ponyville is here but me. That means this Loop is for nobody but me. Whatever I do this Loop, I do for myself.</i></p><p class="double"><i>So... what do I want for myself?</i></p><p class="double">Applejack interlaced her fingers in her lap, closed her eyes, and let her mind go blank. Twilight and Fluttershy had both taught her meditation, and she&#039;d found it really did help at finding answers you&#039;d hidden within yourself. <i>Just let the thoughts die away. Shut away the outside world. Turn off the senses, until your own heartbeat is the only thing you hear, the pulse of the earth the only thing you can feel. Turn your mind off, open it, and find the thing lost inside.</i></p><p class="double">Instead of finding answers, she found power.</p><p class="double">She could sense something extremely powerful not all that far away- not Looper ancient, but at least hundreds of years old. With her eyes closed she could see it glowing through the hills northwest of town. She could feel it tugging at her like a kite string when she opened her eyes again, plucking at both her earth pony magic and earthbending talent, leading her in the precise direction if she wanted to follow.</p><p class="double"><i>And yes, I do want to follow. Ain&#039;t no point in tryin&#039; to find my answer if I just ignore it.</i></p><p class="double">Loop memories continued to surface as Applejack ignored the roads and worked her way cross-country, using her skills to pass through the densely wooded steep hillsides without damaging a single plant. On the other side of the hills lay more farms, mostly belonging to the extended Masaki clan. (Yoshiko went to school with a Masaki, come to think of it. His older sister spent most of her time away at school or work or something.) A small lake glittered in the sunlight at the bottom of the valley. On the hill above the lake stood the Masaki shrine, dedicated to the memory of a legendary warrior who had imprisoned a demon in a cave in the hillside centuries before. The shrine never held festivals and seldom had visitors of any kind; &quot;Yoshiko&quot; had gone only once before to seek advice from the spirits on whether to stay with her aunt and uncle or go back to Aoyama.</p><p class="double"><i>Somethin&#039; familiar about this</i>, Applejack thought, <i>but I can&#039;t think of why. Still, kind of makes sense that somethin&#039; powerful and magical would be at or next to a Shinto shrine</i>.</p><p class="double">The power tugging at her senses led her down the other side of the hill to a spring-fed pond a little way above the lake. In the center of the pond stood a tree, an immense tree of hundreds of years&#039; age if the thickness of the trunk was anything to judge by. Several freshly folded <i>shide</i> hung from a rope tied around the trunk, marking the tree as holy.</p><p class="double"><i>As if I couldn&#039;t tell that myself. I don&#039;t need to see it. I can feel her. And I&#039;m pretty sure she can feel me.</i></p><p class="double">A mix of stepping stones and wooden posts rose just above the water level of the spring, allowing Applejack to walk right up to the trunk itself. She put a hand to the trunk and said, &quot;Howdy. I&#039;m Yoshiko, but I&#039;d rather be called Applejack.&quot;</p><p class="double">A scattering of rainbow lasers flashed down from the leaves into the water around her. Applejack didn’t even bat an eye at the light show, nor at how she could sense words echoing from the tree’s depths. Loops are Loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;Funaho? That&#039;s a nice name.&quot;</p><p class="double">More lasers rained down from the leaves.</p><p class="double">&quot;How&#039;d you know I was a Looper? Do trees Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">More lasers, these slightly redder than the ones before.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yeah. Didn&#039;t mean to be insultin&#039;. Nothin&#039; wrong if a tree does start Loopin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">The tree explained, through its laser-based telepathy, that although it did not Loop, it had a connection to Looper memories that made it aware of the Loops&#039; existence. One such was its own grandmother, who was both tree and human, in a way Funaho wasn&#039;t able to explain. Another was the Loop&#039;s Anchor, who had Awakened only an hour or so before.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just about th&#039; time I Awoke, too,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;Where is she?&quot;</p><p class="double">After a lot of laser-based laughter, Funaho pointed out that Applejack&#039;s default gender was incorrect. Tenchi was, in fact, male.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoops. Sorr- HEY!&quot; Applejack stepped back from the tree, almost slipping off the stepping posts and into the water. &quot;I KNEW there was somethin&#039; familiar about this! This is that Loop Twilight visited that one time, with that super mad scientist girl! What was her name?&quot;</p><p class="double">The tree suggested tactfully that it might be good to say hello to the local Anchor and continue the conversation there.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe,&quot; Applejack said, putting her hand back on the trunk and running her hand along its bark. &quot;But to tell th&#039; truth I feel a lot more comfortable around trees.&quot;</p><p class="double">Funaho suggested that more trees could be arranged, but for now she really ought to speak with Tenchi.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, all right.&quot; Applejack reluctantly stepped away from the tree and back onto solid ground. &quot;But I&#039;ll be back for a longer talk when I get a chance.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack didn&#039;t hear words in her head anymore, but the cascade of light from the branches seemed to her like a welcome to return.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack got to the top of the stairs and passed through the torii gate just in time to hear a teenage boy shouting, &quot;Grandpa? The demon of the cave and I are going into town! Do you want anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Have a good time! But lock the gate back before you leave!&quot; The slightly raspy shout came from the small living quarters next to the shrine proper.</p><p class="double">Applejack raised an eyebrow at this exchange. Kinda makes me wonder, she thought, what the first day shenanigans we pull in th&#039; home Loop look like to visitors. &quot;Hello?&quot; she called out. &quot;I&#039;m lookin&#039; for someone named Tenchi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Tenchi,&quot; a deep female voice cooed, &quot;is there something you should tell me about? Met another girl already?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, must be a visitor,&quot; the first voice said. Applejack finally spotted the voices, coming from another set of stone steps that went even further up the hillside. The boy, obviously, was a nondescript black-haired, brown-eyed teenager. The female voice, on the other hand, belonged to a colorfully dressed woman with long, spiky hair brushed back from her brow- hair almost the exact color of Lyra Heartstrings&#039; coat, Applejack noted.</p><p class="double">And both of them, Applejack sensed, pulsed with power- even more so than Funaho the tree had. She hadn&#039;t sensed it before because, being an earth pony farmer by both origin and preference, Applejack had noticed the tree first.</p><p class="double">&quot;Howdy,&quot; she called out, walking over to the pair. &quot;I&#039;ve been thrown for a Loop and I&#039;m lookin&#039; for a strong Anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We figured,&quot; the boy said. &quot;I&#039;m Masaki Tenchi, and this is Ryoko. We were about to go round up the rest of our local Loopers.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is that why y&#039;all didn&#039;t respond to my ping?&quot; Applejack asked pointedly.</p><p class="double">Tenchi rubbed the back of his head and laughed nervously. &quot;Uh, sorry about that. We almost always Loop together now, and we have so few visiting Loopers, that I kind of forgot to listen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fair enough, I guess. I&#039;m Applejack. From Equestria,&quot; she added quickly. &quot;My local name this Loop is Yoshiko, but, well, you know how it is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good to meet you. How&#039;s Twilight doing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s been better. Our Loop had a number of expansions, and ever since the latest expansion it seems hell-bent on destroying the library she lives in. She&#039;s not taking it well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, who cares about a bunch of books anyway?&quot; Ryoko grumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re only saying that because we haven’t rescued Washuu from Kagato yet,&quot; Tenchi muttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s who I was tryin&#039; to remember,&quot; Applejack said, smacking fist against palm. &quot;Twilight and her got on like a house on fire, to hear Twilight tell it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The house DID catch fire.&quot; Now it was Ryoko&#039;s turn to mutter. &quot;Five times.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which isn&#039;t that much more often than you and Ayeka do it,&quot; Tenchi replied. &quot;Anyway, she doesn&#039;t usually Awaken until she&#039;s freed from Kagato. The fight can get pretty dangerous.&quot; Tenchi frowned slightly. &quot;If you want, we can talk again after it&#039;s over. We don&#039;t want to put you at risk.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack grinned. She reached her power into the earth and Bent, raising the cobblestones she stood on into a three meter column of stone and soil. She reached into her subspace pocket and pulled out a Space Marine autocannon, sized for the genetically engineered giant warriors and longer than she was tall. She held it up in one hand, using the other to pull out a Skifandr duelling sword. &quot;I think I can handle myself,&quot; she said. &quot;But it&#039;s your call. I prefer to be a team player. It&#039;s what I&#039;m good at.&quot; She cocked her head in thought and added, &quot;That, and apples.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ryoko rose into the air, hovering in front of Applejack and examining the BFG. &quot;Those must be some mean apple trees.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Naw, th&#039; trees are all sweethearts,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;Th&#039; fruitbats are a whole other matter, though.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Applejack asked when the battle was over. &quot;A pipe organ? Did he really think that was original?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, sorry if our universe&#039;s evil bastards aren&#039;t original enough for you!&quot; Ryoko snapped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please do not mind Ryoko.&quot; Ayeka, princess of Jurai, stepped forward with a dangerous gleam in her eye. &quot;We have more urgent matters to consider. In particular...&quot; The princess gave Applejack a stare that would have done a police interrogator proud. &quot;What are your intentions towards Lord Tenchi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My what now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;After all this time they still do this to almost every female visiting Looper,&quot; Tenchi groaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spill the beans!&quot; Ryoko shouted. &quot;We know Tenchi&#039;s irresistible, but we&#039;re not letting any visiting Looper try to horn in on us!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So if you have any base desires as regards Lord Tenchi, kindly abandon them now! We will not permit it!&quot; Ayeka declared.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... beg pardon,&quot; Applejack muttered, &quot;but as cute as he is, if you&#039;re inta that sort of thing-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What sort of thing?&quot; Ayeka asked. &quot;Do you find something wrong with Lord Tenchi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s bipedal, omnivorous, lives in another universe...&quot; Applejack shrugged and added, &quot;An&#039; he ain&#039;t an apple. I&#039;m th&#039; kinda pony who&#039;s married to my work.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pony?&quot; Ayeka looked the thoroughly humanoid Applejack up and down. &quot;Have the Loops driven you insane?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s from Equestria,&quot; Washuu put in. &quot;Remember Twilight Sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that explains it,&quot; Ayeka nodded. &quot;Is she a friend of hers? It was nice having a sensible fellow princess around the house. With a sensible hair color.&quot; The purple-haired princess nodded her head in approval.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... about that,&quot; Applejack shrugged. &quot;I&#039;ve been feelin&#039; a bit like a third cartwheel ever since I got here. Seems like my friends, especially Twilight, are kinda leavin&#039; me behind, and I hadn&#039;t noticed until they weren&#039;t actually around.&quot; After noticing the wave of confused looks, she continued, &quot;I mean, all my friends seem to be growin&#039; and learnin&#039; new things, but I&#039;m just th&#039; same old me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooooooooooh,&quot; all the others said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Power issues,&quot; Washuu nodded sagely. &quot;You don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re getting all the neat tricks your friends have.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No! .... um. yes.... um, maybe?&quot; Applejack sat down on the couch and slumped forward, chin on her hands. &quot;It&#039;s just like... I dunno... I don&#039;t have anythin&#039; that says, &#039;I&#039;m a Looper with unique adventures and skills.&#039; Instead I&#039;m just th&#039; one who goes along with whatever someone else is doin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I get it!&quot; Mihoshi giggled. &quot;It&#039;s like that Loop where I spent the whole time watching TV and eating snacks while everyone else went out having adventures and stuff. I was having a good time at the time, but I felt like I hadn&#039;t really gained anything from it, and that made me really sad.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;(As if it were ONLY one Loop,)&quot; Ayeka whispered to Ryoko, who nodded her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s how it works,&quot; Applejack said. <i>Memo to self,</i> she thought: <i>putting this woman and Pinkie Pie together: probably VERY bad.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Washuu waved a hand, and a tasselled cushion appeared in midair, supported by nothing. She bounced up to sit on it and bounced her clasped hands on her knees as she spoke. &quot;Well, maybe we can offer a bit of perspective. You see, we don&#039;t have that problem in this Loop. In fact, it&#039;s kind of the opposite.&quot;</p><p class="double">The light in the living room changed, and suddenly a vast dark shadow rose behind Washuu- her own silhouette. The little girl seated next to Applejack on the couch- Sasami- had a similar silhouette. &quot;Bear in mind that in our baseline, two of us are two-thirds of the highest pantheon in a twelve-dimensional universe. We suspected Tenchi had the potential to surpass even us... again, in our baseline. And every other person you see here,&quot; the little redheaded mad scientist gestured around the room, &quot;has combat power, strength, psychic abilities, and political connections which by any other world&#039;s standards are ludicrous.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ranma Saotome started out as an ordinary mortal. He&#039;s still only about demigod rank, all things considered. He can still pick up new skills and power and what-not. But we cannot. We dare not. We don&#039;t know how much more power it would take for any of us to Ascend, but it can&#039;t be much. And we love each other, this world we created, and this family we sort of fell into, too much to risk destroying it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ryoko fidgeted and muttered, &quot;Jeez, can the lovey-dovey mushy stuff, already.&quot;</p><p class="double">Washuu shrugged. &quot;So we spend our Loops mostly as homebodies. These days we pretty much all loop together, which makes it easier. We have a few variants where our power levels get severely reduced... well, most of us, anyway.&quot; She shot a glance at Sasami.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s wrong with being a magical girl?&quot; Sasami replied. &quot;Why don&#039;t you try it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And when we have fused Loops outside our world, we usually end up at normal human power levels,&quot; Washuu continued, ignoring the comment. &quot;Which only encourages us to keep a low profile.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So what you&#039;re sayin&#039; is,&quot; Applejack drawled, &quot;that y&#039;all don&#039;t really have any perspective on my problem at all!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not one little bit!&quot; Washuu agreed.</p><p class="double">Applejack groaned and pulled her hat over her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;But we do try to be hospitable to visiting Loopers,&quot; Washuu continued. &quot;I wouldn&#039;t call it a sanctuary Loop like you have at home- if someone wants to make trouble, we let them have fun... until some of the OTHER absurdly powerful forces in our world catch up with them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like Lady Seto,&quot; Ayeka smiled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Or Tokimi,&quot; Sasami grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Or Seina,&quot; Tenchi nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Or Grandmother!&quot; Mihoshi giggled.</p><p class="double">&quot;This world can take care of itself pretty well,&quot; Washuu said. &quot;But if you&#039;re more inclined to play nicely, we can be more helpful than that. What would you like to try?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What d&#039;ya mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You can hang around here, you can study in my lab, you can go offworld-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Offworld!&quot; The decision happened before Applejack thought of the reasons. Staying here would mean staying on the farm- well, on somebody&#039;s farm, anyway. If this was going to be her Loop just for her, then she&#039;d have to seek out adventure- and what more adventure could you ask for than outer space? You always got adventure and excitement and like that in outer space, especially if you were travelling with Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Trixie, or (oak help the aliens) any combination of the three.</p><p class="double">&quot;All right,&quot; Washuu said. &quot;Is there anything in particular-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mya.&quot; The shortest and furriest member of the household, who had spent the entire conversation lying still in Sasami&#039;s lap, looked up at Applejack. &quot;MyaI&#039;ve been talking with Funaho,&quot; Ryo-Ohki said in a half-squeak, half-meow. &quot;She really likes you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought she Awoke here on Earth,&quot; Ryoko grumbled. &quot;Or are you talking about the tree, sis?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Must mean th&#039; tree,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;We had a brief chat before I met you an&#039; Tenchi.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you like trees,&quot; Ryo-Ohki continued, &quot;how would you like to meet Funaho and Ryu-Oh&#039;s sisters?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... sure?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jurai, a planet whose surface is seventy percent forest. (That doesn’t mean seventy percent of the land area is forest. Practically all the land, and a large part of the oceans, are covered in trees.)</p><p class="double">Jurai, where the capital city, imperial palace, main shipyards, and principal holy site are all located in a single tree… a tree so tall its crown brushes the planet’s tropopause.</p><p class="double">Jurai, a planet where practically everything, even the spaceships, are made of wood.</p><p class="double">A casual visitor would take the impression that the human species native to Jurai was just a touch tree-happy, and the casual visitor would be understating the case. Jurai had been founded when a space pirate discovered a very special tree indeed… and the secrets of that meeting had made Jurai the single most powerful political and military force in the known galaxy (that didn’t live under Tenchi’s roof).</p><p class="double">So when that eldest tree, the goddess of Jurai, had manifested in human form and requested top clearance for a special visitor to the most sacred, most secret, most secure location in all Jurai space- the place even the rulers of Jurai walked only seldom, and the common citizens never- the answer had been, <i>It shall be done.</i></p><p class="double">Still, the royal courtiers and priestesses could be excused for flinching when their visitor said, “Whoo-ee! Ain’t this somethin’?”</p><p class="double">Applejack gawked at the vast open area in the heart of the great tree, at the saplings of the royal trees, all descendants of the original, each planted in a special platform that hovered in total defiance of gravity well separate from the central walkway. It was worth gawking at. Not even in Lothlorien, in the Arda Loop, had Applejack seen living wood and trees in such a vast and glorious display of the power of growing things.</p><p class="double">And then the trees began to flash with rainbow laser light, and Applejack could hear their voices in her head.</p><p class="double"><i>Hey! This one’s different!</i></p><p class="double"><i>I like how she feels!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Who are you?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Who are you?</i></p><p class="double">“Er, I’m Applejack. Nice to meet all of ya.”</p><p class="double"><i>She’s an Applejack!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Hi, Applejack!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Welcome, Applejack!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Are you here to name one of us?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Hey, no fair! I want to bond with her!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Oooh! Pick me! Pick me!</i></p><p class="double">Dozens of the floating platforms began moving, rising from the distant depths, descending from the heights of the great chamber, clustering around the center of the walkway where Applejack stood.</p><p class="double"><i>Hey, be kind to my friend.</i> Applejack couldn’t quite tell if that was Sasami’s voice. It felt like her, but… <i>Don’t be rude! Behave yourselves!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Sorry, mama/mistress,</i> a ragged chorus of tree-voices echoed in Applejack’s head. The platforms backed off a little distance, no longer overshadowing the walkway, but still staying close. To Applejack it seemed like Birnham Wood had come to the Galactic Senate.</p><p class="double">Most of the attendants had scrambled away at the approach of the royal trees. Only two remained standing: Funaho Misaki Jurai, first wife of the Emperor of Jurai (and the woman the tree was named after) and Seto Kamiki Jurai, the emperor’s mother-in-law by second marriage. &quot;I&#039;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; Funaho said, helping Applejack to her feet from where she’d ducked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Every single unbonded tree actually moving their platforms and swarming her,&quot; Seto nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you hear the voices?” Applejack asked, looking back and forth.</p><p class="double">“For most of those who bond with a royal tree,” Funaho said, “it is only an empathic bond, not true telepathy. And for those not bonded, not even that, except on those rare occasions when Tsunami speaks. We heard her just now.”</p><p class="double">“I heard Sasami’s voice,” Applejack said.</p><p class="double">“Tsunami has chosen to be Sasami’s tree,” Funaho said.</p><p class="double">“Just as, apparently, every single tree here has chosen to be yours,&quot; Seto continued, &quot;I’d call it entertaining, but…&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack frowned uncomfortably. &quot;I&#039;m sorry. I&#039;m powerful sorry,&quot; she said, turning on her feet to address the trees. “I am really very sorry. But Washuu an&#039; Tsunami explained th&#039; Loops to ya, right?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Loops? What are those?</i></p><p class="double"><i>My Key is shaped like loops! You could make a necklace out of it!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Hey, I can make a key shaped like a loop too!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Children!</i> This time the dominant voice sounded a lot less like Sasami; older, vastly more mature.</p><p class="double">The trees subsided again.</p><p class="double">&quot;More or less,&quot; Seto said. &quot;You&#039;re repeating time, and after a few years you&#039;ll be returning to your home universe.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s th&#039; thing,&quot; Applejack said, facing the Juraian royalty again. &quot;I could go bond with one o&#039; them trees, all nice ladies an&#039; gentlemen that they are. An&#039; for a few years I don&#039;t doubt we&#039;d have a lot of fun. But then th&#039; Loop would end. I&#039;d go home, but my friend would jus&#039;... vanish. As if she never existed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And are we any different?&quot; Seto said calmly. &quot;We would all reset to where we were at the start of the Loop, none the wiser. But you would at least have the memory of the fun times. I think you&#039;re making a mistake. I always say, better to regret having done something than to regret having done nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s only part of it,&quot; Applejack sighed. &quot;Whichever tree bonded with me would be in my head all the time, right? No secrets. An&#039; whatever tree I took would know it was on borrowed time. &#039;Tain&#039;t fair to th&#039; tree, is what I&#039;m sayin&#039;.</p><p class="double">&quot;If I could take her with me when the Loop ended, like I could a lightsaber or computer or somethin&#039;, that&#039;d be different.&quot; Applejack pulled a lightsaber, a laptop, and a small pickup truck (complete with cardboard cutout Twilight Sparkle) out of her subspace pocket to demonstrate. As she put them back, she continued, &quot;I built a tree-ship once for a battleship game, an&#039; any of yours would put mine to shame. But Loopers share horror stories of the old days when the Original Seven Loopers put people in their pockets- heck, sometimes whole populations in subspace, an’ th’ next time they looked they were all dead of old age, killed each other in wars, or jus’ plain vanished. We don’t do that anymore. Ever.” Well, excepting accidents, but Applejack didn’t even like to think of those situations, much less talk about them.</p><p class="double">“If I got one o&#039; them trees inta th&#039; pocket, no tellin&#039; what&#039;d be there when I tried to pull it out next Loop... but I don&#039;t think it&#039;d be one o&#039; these sweet, friendly, intelligent creatures we got here. I&#039;m terrified it&#039;d be a pile o&#039; rotten sawdust.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>No,</i> the trees all replied. <i>No, no. We wouldn’t let it happen. No.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Perhaps seeds, then?&quot; Seto hazarded. &quot;Grow a new one whenever-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, dangit!&quot; Applejack stomped her forehoof... then remembered she didn&#039;t have forehooves, and she&#039;d just bent forward and jammed her middle finger on the walkway. She straightened back up and rubbed her sore finger, continuing, &quot;I am NOT bringin&#039; any intelligent life form inta th&#039; world just so th&#039; Loops can wipe it out four or five years later!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Seto smiled warmly, gently grasping Applejack’s injured hand, &quot;you&#039;re obviously upset, and I think we can let the matter lie for now. Why don&#039;t you have that hand looked at, my dear? And while you&#039;re doing that, I&#039;ll have a chat with a few people.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What about?&quot; Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, this and that.&quot; Seto flipped open a fan and covered her lips with it, walking along the walkway to the far gates of the Sacred Grove.</p><p class="double"><i>Bye, Applejack!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Come visit us soon, Applejack!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Why do I have th&#039; feelin&#039; she&#039;s plottin&#039; somethin&#039;?&quot; Applejack asked Empress Funaho.</p><p class="double">&quot;If Lady Seto is awake,&quot; Funaho sighed, &quot;then she&#039;s ALWAYS plotting something.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack opened her eyes and immediately wondered if she&#039;d slept through the ending of a Loop.</p><p class="double">There had been a banquet. Said banquet had included quite a lot of large mugs of a strange fruit wine- she&#039;d done a classic spit-take when Lady Seto had told her that one bottle of the stuff could buy a whole bucking PLANET. After reassurance that there was plenty for everyone and that it was only withheld from the market to keep prices up (reminding Applejack of zap-apple jam back home), she&#039;d developed a taste for the stuff.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been mellow... no, she&#039;d been way beyond mellow, she&#039;d been downright plastered by the time she was escorted to a guest bedroom better than anything the palace at Canterlot could boast. She should have been waking up in that room again with a hangover that only Berry Punch could truly empathize with.</p><p class="double">Instead she was wide-eyed, clear-headed, and sitting up in a modest bed in a modest room with no windows- hence Applejack wondering if she&#039;d Awakened in a new Loop.</p><p class="double">Check mirror- nope. Yoshiko Fujiringo still stared back at her.</p><p class="double">So. What. The. <i>Buck?</i></p><p class="double">She reached out with her earthbending senses... and felt absolutely nothing. No soil. No rocks. No plants. Not even ordinary metal or wood, aside from the bedframe. Absolutely nothing with an affinity for the ancient element for a very, very, VERY long way.</p><p class="double">She summoned the Element of Honesty, and she sighed with relief as the necklace and gem appeared around her neck. <i>Right. The kick-flank-and-take-names option is ready and on standby.</i></p><p class="double">Applejack walked over to the far wall from the bed, which appeared to have a Star Trek world sliding door set into it. It didn&#039;t open automatically as she approached, but there was a touch-pad to the right. When she put her hand to the panel, it buzzed irritably. Touch, <i>buzz.</i> Touch, <i>buzz.</i> Touch touch touch, <i>buzz buzz braaaap.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Well, this is gettin&#039; annoy-</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s strange! I wonder if it&#039;s broken?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack spun around. The blonde woman with dark skin, a cheerful smile and huge blue eyes had NOT been there ten seconds before. Nor had the mop in her hands.</p><p class="double">Wait... mop?</p><p class="double">Seriously, <i>what the </i><i><b>buck?</b></i></p><p class="double">&quot;Here, let me have a look.&quot; The strange woman stepped past Applejack and bent down to stare at the panel. She reached out her hand, and her fingers danced in a complex pattern Applejack couldn&#039;t follow. At the end, one corner of the panel blinked yellow. &quot;Oh, I see!&quot; the woman with the mop said. &quot;You haven&#039;t answered your messages yet! Would you like to do that now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Possibly the strangest thing about the woman was the voice- as cheerful as Pinkie&#039;s, but with the soft edge she usually associated with Fluttershy. In fact, if it wasn&#039;t for the softness, she&#039;d have sworn-</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, beg pardon, ma&#039;am,&quot; Applejack said quietly, &quot;but are y&#039;all any relation to a young woman named Mihoshi?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, have you met Mihoshi?&quot; The smile grew a little bit more cheerful. &quot;She&#039;s my daughter! I&#039;m Mitoto Kuramitsu. Glad to meet you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... Yoshiko Fujiringo, but my friends call me Applejack.&quot; After shuffling her feet for a moment, she added, &quot;An&#039; beggin&#039; your pardon again, but where exactly ARE we?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... um.... um...&quot; Applejack&#039;s heart sank as Mitoto looked around the room. &quot;Well, that&#039;s funny... I was cleaning the girls&#039; dormitory at the GP Academy, but this certainly isn&#039;t one of the rooms there!&quot; After a bit of a nervous giggle, she added, &quot;It looks more like a first-class stateroom of an Express-class transport ship.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s mouth opened to ask how a body could get on a transport ship without realizing it. It shut again when she realized: (a) the same instincts that told her to not ask questions about Pinkie Pie screamed at her now; and (b) Applejack herself had no idea how she got on board a spaceship in mid-flight. Oh, she could <i>guess</i>, but guesses didn&#039;t count.</p><p class="double">So, for lack of any better ideas, Applejack reached a finger forward and pushed the flashing yellow square on the door&#039;s touchpad.</p><p class="double">A large screen appeared in the wall to the right of the touchpad. Lady Seto sat in a luxurious wooden chair, waving a paper fan, flanked by attendants. &quot;Good morning, Applejack,&quot; she said, her voice a purr that put Applejack in mind of a cat on an all-canary diet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, Seto!&quot; Mitoto waved. &quot;Wow, Applejack, I didn&#039;t know you were friends with Seto!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I hope you had a pleasant night&#039;s sleep,&quot; the Demon Princess of Jurai continued with barely a pause. &quot;You&#039;ll be glad to know that I looked up a few things as regards the problem you had with our trees.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah yeah yeah, whoop-de-doo, tell me what Ah&#039;m DOIN&#039; here!&quot; Applejack growled.</p><p class="double">&quot;I got this straight from the horse&#039;s mouth, so to speak.&quot; Seto’s recorded image smirked wickedly. “You didn’t tell us about that, by the way. Next time I’ll make sure the banquet has plenty of oats and hay.”</p><p class="double">“I prefer apples,” Applejack muttered. “An’ roses when they’re in season.”</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway,” Seto continued, using her fan to wave away the detail, “I spoke with Tsunami herself, and she reassures me that your concerns as regards the trees are quite mistaken. The bonding ritual includes a soul-bond which Tsunami reports is almost identical to soul-bonds of universes like Mid-Childa or Bleach... whatever those are,” Seto shrugged. “Ryu-Oh in particular has traveled along with Ayeka to most loops where her own subspace pocket is accessible, with no ill effects. In most other universes the trees&#039; power is very much reduced, but it is still capable of fully powering a starship and engaging in combat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here are a few other facts to put your mind at rest, though I&#039;d appreciate it if you kept these to yourself while you&#039;re in our universe. First, trees of Jurai are not susceptible to old age. Second, all royal trees from Tsunami to the fourth generation can create a seed of themselves when death is imminent, containing their memories and power. For all practical purposes short of total disintegration, the trees are immortal.</p><p class="double">&quot;And finally... royal trees generate their own subspace pockets. My own tree keeps a small continent inside its main unit, which is most convenient for keeping pets or hosting guests. Tsunami and Washuu both say it is extremely unlikely, should you bond with a tree of Jurai, that these Loops would present any great difficulty.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack wanted to sit down, but the bed was too far away from the viewscreen. &quot;So what you&#039;re sayin&#039; is-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In short, if you want a tree, you can have one,&quot; Seto continued. &quot;Obviously there are a lot of trees who want their very own Applejack. But there are... conditions.&quot; The fan snapped shut with a loud clack. &quot;Tsunami and Washuu have both pointed out that you probably won&#039;t return to our universe anytime soon, if ever- and if you did I wouldn’t remember you. You would have to build your own main unit to house the tree and care for the tree by yourself, without any aid from us. You would also have to learn how to operate the ship your tree would power- since, of course, we could not provide you with a crew.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, to make a long story short, we&#039;re going to test and see how badly you want that tree. I&#039;ve sponsored you for the next class at the GP Academy, which begins in five days. Graduation takes two years, after which your education will continue on the job, as it were. Tsunami and Washuu assure me that our loop has a stable run-time of at least twenty years, possibly quite a bit longer if certain variants crop up, so asking you to give five years to the Galaxy Police seems like a safe test.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Th&#039; Galaxy Police?&quot; Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;After you&#039;ve completed five years of honorable service... assuming you survive, but that shouldn&#039;t be a problem... return to Jurai, and we will teach you the secrets of building a containment unit for your ship. If you absorb your lessons well enough... then we shall see which tree gets the honor of surviving the end of this Loop with you.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, I have no doubt you&#039;ll accept my offer, considering the deep love of trees you showed us all here,&quot; Seto continued, reopening her fan and using it to hide her smile. &quot;But I thought it wise to send you on your way while you slept, so that you wouldn&#039;t waste time and energy dithering about it. But remember... if you feel for whatever reason that you can&#039;t go through with it, you can always say no at any time. You can drop out of the Academy; you can resign your commission; you can avoid Jurai for the rest of your stay. You&#039;ll be returned to Earth at once with no hard feelings and no questions asked.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s teeth ground. She had had some misgivings, mostly about having her ability to choose her destiny taken from her, but that last little bit had flushed them right out of her head on a wave of anger. <i>What kind of pon- er, woman does Seto think I am? Apples ain&#039;t quitters!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I do believe that covers everything,&quot; Seto said. &quot;Good luck, Applejack, and have a wonderful time!&quot;</p><p class="double">The viewscreen blanked out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow!&quot; Mitoto gasped, hugging Applejack to her bosom. &quot;You&#039;re going to be a GP cadet! We&#039;re going to be seeing a lot of one another! Oh, I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be the best of friends!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bwuffle? Murfle mffpt mff-&quot; Applejack managed to break the hug and get a clear breath. &quot;How&#039;s that again? Are you part of this &#039;Galaxy Police&#039; thing too?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; Mitoto smiled. &quot;My father is Grand Marshall of the GP. My mother is headmistress of the Academy. And I&#039;m the chief of sanitation!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yer... yer... aw, I can&#039;t say it.&quot; <i>I don&#039;t care how happy she seems to be about it, nopony deserves th&#039; title, &#039;head cleaning lady.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, I believe your door’s unlocked now!&quot; Mitoto smiled. She touched the panel, and the doors slid open onto a futuristic-looking corridor. &quot;Would you like to go meet the captain?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The technician&#039;s name was Erma. Unlike most of the other people Applejack had seen in this universe&#039;s space travels, she didn&#039;t have a human face. Instead she had a muzzle and slit eyes, looking like a cross between a cat and a dog from the neck up.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Taint fair,</i> Applejack thought. <i>There&#039;s gotta be a planet of pony people in this Galactic Union thing. Why couldn&#039;t I have started there?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Before you begin classes at the GP Academy, you must undergo body modification,&quot; Erma said. &quot;Nanobots will be introduced into your bloodstream. These will reconstruct your body, making you stronger, faster, and more resistant to damage.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really,&quot; Applejack said coolly. &quot;How &#039;bout not? Supposin&#039; I already had somethin&#039; just as good, or even better?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we can put it to the test and see,&quot; Erma shrugged. &quot;If you can meet the minimum standards without body modification, it&#039;s not required. But the process is free and safe, so there really isn&#039;t any reason not to have it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You had this body modification yourself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then how &#039;bout a little race?&quot; Applejack asked. &quot;Got an obstacle course &#039;round here?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ten minutes later the alien Wau and the human Applejack stood at the starting line of the Academy&#039;s obstacle course. &quot;Twice around the main track before entering the obstacles, then once through them. Agreed?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Agreed. Y&#039;all call it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ready... set... GO!&quot; Erma took off in a superhuman blur of motion.</p><p class="double">Applejack grinned, summoned her Element, and reached for its full power. Alicorn ascension wasn&#039;t quite possible here, but as the power surged through her, she knew the difference in power wasn&#039;t enough to worry about. Her ears shifted from human to pony ears. A long tail sprang out of the seat of her pants. <i>Call it magic, call it esper power, call it manipulating probabilities... whatever you call it, I got it. </i></p><p class="double"><i>And now y’gonna see why Rainbow Dash is th&#039; only pony can keep up with me on th&#039; ground. Ms. Erma.</i></p><p class="double">Erma rounded the final curve of her first lap, expecting to see Applejack ahead of her just waiting to be lapped. She was going a good fifty kilometers per hour, which for an enhanced body was about equivalent to a light jog. No unmodified human- and especially not one from a primitive world like Earth- could do better than thirty kilometers per hour for any great period of time.</p><p class="double">Instead Erma heard a rumble as if a stampede of hooved animals were right behind her. A gust of wind nearly blew her off her feet, and then a yellow-haired blur faded ahead of her into the far curve.</p><p class="double"><i>Wha- Bu- How- Time to bring my A game!</i> Erma picked up her own pace, pushing herself to maximum effort. Applejack still pulled ahead. By the time Erma was midway through her second lap, Applejack was already crawling under the cargo nets like a serpent. Erma watched, her own pace slowing to a walk, as the cadet entered the tires, her pounding feet sending sod flying three meters high. She ignored the rope swing, leaping across the mud pit and landing perfectly on one foot in the middle of the balance beam beyond.</p><p class="double">Past that stood the wall- five meters of sheer, slick metal wall a foot thick. It had been built to withstand the worst abuse cadets could throw at it, even cadets with the latest body-mods and strength training.</p><p class="double">Erma&#039;s jaw dropped as Applejack hit the wall with her shoulder like a hockey player checking an opponent. The wall leaped out of the ground and went flying, smashing into the bleachers at the other end of the stadium.</p><p class="double">Applejack stopped just short of the cargo net climb, turning around to face the admissions officer. &quot;Er, sorry &#039;bout th&#039; mess,&quot; she said. &quot;But Ah think Ah made my point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... um... yes,&quot; Erma gasped. &quot;So long as you&#039;re willing to undergo special tests and physical examination... then I think we can waive the body modification.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Yes. Lots of tests. And a report. </i></p><p class="double"><i>Two reports.</i></p><p class="double">Unnoticed by Applejack, Erma&#039;s eyes narrowed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Dear Tenchi and all,</i></p><p class="double"><i>The GP Academy has turned out to be pretty interesting so far. I&#039;m learning a lot about your technology, your laws, and your worlds. O&#039;course all of that stuff you already know and would likely bore you, so I&#039;ll talk a bit about the people I&#039;ve met.</i></p><p class="double"><i>First there&#039;s Mitoto, Mihoshi&#039;s mother. By the way, she says hi and to tell Mihoshi to stay warm, since it&#039;s autumn back in Japan. She reminds me of a calm Pinkie Pie: she&#039;s friends with everybody, and it&#039;s pretty clear there&#039;s a genius hiding behind that innocent face. I learned the hard way not to follow her when she&#039;s cleaning, though- we ended up on a Galactic Army ship three sectors away, and I missed a week of classes riding back with that ship! Like I said, she REALLY reminds me of Pinkie.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Mihoshi&#039;s great-aunt Mikami runs this place. We&#039;ve spoken together a few times. I gather she&#039;s friends with Lady Seto, and Seto&#039;s pulling strings to make sure I don&#039;t end up in an office somewhere doing nothing. Doesn&#039;t feel rightly fair, but on the other hand it does mean I&#039;m getting all sorts of chances to show what I can do! </i></p><p class="double"><i>I even got to meet Mihoshi&#039;s grandfather, the GP Marshal, but he spent most of the time interrogating me about Mihoshi being on Earth. I told him the truth, excepting the parts about Loops, which means I didn&#039;t tell him much.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Then there&#039;s my student advisor, Erma. I don&#039;t know if I get along with her or not. She never lies to me, but I always have a feeling she&#039;s hiding something around me. All the medical tests and scientific exams she puts me through don&#039;t make me trust her more, I tell you that. If I wanted to be a blamed guinea pig I&#039;d have stayed there and let a real expert do the poking and prodding!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Then there are my roommates. They&#039;re nice, but I think they&#039;re proof that the Loops have a lousy sense of humor. (No news there.) One of them is a Wau who&#039;s the spittin&#039; image of my dog back home. Even the name- Ona na Wyn- no way is that a coincidence! And then there&#039;s the other one... she&#039;s an Inanan... and consarn it I KNEW you had a planet full of pony-people in your Loop! And yes, she looks like one of the newest Loopers from my world- calls herself Brightly Doo here, but I know Derpy when I see her. Makes sense, though... she&#039;s a delivery mare back home, and the GP funds itself as the high-priority mail and shipping service for the galaxy. Knowing my luck, her Looping self will probably remember this Loop. She does that sort of thing sometimes.</i></p><p class="double"><i>I get on fine with both of &#039;em... but it&#039;s just so weird!!</i></p><p class="double"><i>One more thing: tomorrow I begin combat classes. The teacher is the mens&#039; fitness supervisor, Captain Seriyo Tennan. I&#039;m hearing a lot of mixed things about him. On the one hand he&#039;s popular because his ships practically never get attacked by pirates. He also has a reputation for taking care of his crews. On the other hand, a lot of people tell me he&#039;s a complete idiot who got where he is on a combination of being super-rich and super-lucky. Can you tell me anything about him? Does he Loop?</i></p><p class="double"><i>I still haven&#039;t decided about the tree thing. I still get the heebie jeebies about putting a thinking being in my pocket. You know the horror stories- you might even have been there for a few! But if I do go through with it, I&#039;ve decided to name her &quot;Shojiki,&quot; for &quot;integrity.&quot; I thought about &quot;Makoto,&quot; but there&#039;s at least three Loopers with that name already. Speaking of name confusion, give my love to Funaho-no-ki, and tell her to be careful of beetles!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Write me back soon!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Love, Applejack</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Applejack,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Seriyo is an arrogant idiot. Thank the Admins he is NOT Looping and hopefully never will. However, he IS lucky, he IS a skilled fighter, and he IS practically indestructible, so have fun with him.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Everyone says hi, and keep on fighting! </i></p><p class="double"><i>Washuu</i></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<br /><p>117.1 (116.4 continued)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;By now you have all qualified with the basic laser pistol and heavy laser rifle. However! There will be times during shipboard combat when stray laser blasts may endanger innocent lives or the structure of the ship or valuable cargo! For this reason we also have this!&quot;</p><p class="double">The thing in the pink-haired loudmouth&#039;s hand was quite clearly a lightsaber, but not the hand-crafted kind Applejack had seen (and once used) in the Star Wars Loop. Seriyo&#039;s force sword looked mass-produced, sleek, simple, and plain. Since nobody else batted an eye at the thing, Applejack gathered that such things were pretty commonplace in this universe. Even in the Star Wars Loop, even before Palpatine got rolling, a lightsaber would get everybody&#039;s instant and undivided attention. Here, not so much.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadet Fujiringo!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack still didn&#039;t care for her local name, but she came to attention automatically for it regardless. &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand you come from a barbarian planet called Earth,&quot; Seriyo smirked. &quot;You&#039;ve probably never seen a weapon like this before!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We ain&#039;t so backward as all that, sir!&quot; Applejack grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;With that accent?&quot; Seriyo barely bothered to cover his chuckle. &quot;It&#039;s fortunate for you that you&#039;ve come to the Academy! We&#039;ll soon have that accent ironed out of you!&quot; He deactivated the blade and tossed the swordhilt to Applejack. &quot;But since you obviously have experience with the weapon, you&#039;ll be glad to demonstrate its usefulness for the rest of the class!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>He thinks I&#039;m nothing but an alligator-mouthed hick,</i> Applejack thought. <i>He&#039;s going to make an example of me.</i> She allowed the corners of her mouth to turn up very slightly. <i>Now to see how much I remember of that Loop where I was Luke Skywalker and Twilight was Yoda. That was a lot of Loops ago, but...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Ignite the blade, cadet!&quot; As Applejack activated the force sword, Seriyo pulled out a standard issue GP laser pistol. &quot;The standard issue GP force sword will deflect laser blasts if wielded by an expert swordsman!&quot; With careful aim Seriyo fired once, spanging a stun-blast off the tip of the sword and into the dirt between Applejack&#039;s feet. &quot;In the hands of an unskilled user, the sword will be more dangerous to the one holding it than to the enemy! Observe!&quot; Seriyo lowered his aim and began squeezing the trigger.</p><p class="double">Applejack let herself go calm, reaching her senses out across the athletic field, through the ivy and trees, through the soil and rocks of the Academy&#039;s artificial habitat. What worked for earth pony magic and earthbending also worked for the Force, at least well enough to see where the stun bolts were going to land.</p><p class="double">The rest of the class saw Applejack close her eyes, then waggle the force sword back and forth, slapping away Seriyo&#039;s shots, sending most of them into the dirt right at Seriyo&#039;s toes. The captain, startled, began picking up one foot and then the other, frantically trying to keep his toes out of the line of fire, still thoughtlessly snapping off one wild shot after another. One flailing foot found a pebble in the mix of soil; a random kick sent it flying into the air.</p><p class="double">The pebble struck the base of Applejack&#039;s saber, stunning her wrists and sending it spinning away.</p><p class="double">Without thinking Applejack switched skill sets. <i>Forget being a Jedi... time to be an Amazon.</i> Twin bracers appeared out of her subspace pocket around her wrists. The shot blocking continued, two handed this time. A bead of sweat trickled down her brow as she tried to recall her skills from two long-ago Loops, one in an anthropomorphic Equestria as Mistress Mare-velous, another in the DC Loop replacing Diana Prince. All she needed was for Seriyo to quit the random shots and bring the pistol back towards her center of mass, then the right deflection- <i>no- no- close- no- no-</i></p><p class="double"><i>YES.</i></p><p class="double">The stun blast took Seriyo straight in the chest. He fell backwards and flopped onto the dirt torn up by his feet.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, lesson inverted, job done.</i> Applejack returned the bracers to her subspace pocket and stepped forward to the prone teacher. <i>Now to show proper respect and get this lesson back on track.</i> &quot;Mr. Tennan! Are you all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Seriyo&#039;s eyes opened. His movements were jerky and twitchy, but the light stun was already wearing off. &quot;You- mock- the great- Seriyo- Tennan!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, sir,&quot; Applejack responded. &quot;Y&#039;all wanted a demonstration, and I did my best, sir.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you CONTINUE to mock me!&quot; Seriyo weeble-wobbled his way to a mostly vertical position. &quot;Barbarian Earthling! You don&#039;t belong at the GP Academy! Go take a hundred laps! That should wear down your savage tendency to insubordination!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Yep,</i> Applejack thought, <i>arrogant idiot. We def&#039;nitly ain&#039;t gonna be friends. And I&#039;m glad I&#039;ve stayed in Mostly Ascended Mode the whole time I&#039;ve been here. Forty kilometers... well, maybe I can catch the last half of the actual lessons.</i></p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s slipstream sent Seriyo spinning back into the dirt, much to the amusement of her classmates.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ryoko Baulta, I understand you have a piece of intelligence for us.&quot; The giant hologram of the chief of the Da Ruma pirate guild loomed over the other pirate captains seated at the virtual conference table.</p><p class="double">A shapely figure, pale-skinned, raven-haired, stood up, her hologram enlarging somewhat so that the others could see and hear her better. &quot;There is a cadet of special abilities in the most recent class at the GP Academy,&quot; she said. &quot;My sources report her name as Yoshiko Fujiringo, though she also goes by the alias Applejack.&quot;</p><p class="double">A two-dimensional picture of the cadet appeared above the conference table. &quot;Although she claims to be an Earthling, she exhibits abilities not typical of the pre-civilized natives of that planet. She apparently has limited shapeshifting abilities- note the equine ears and tail.&quot; The picture switched to footage of Applejack on the GP&#039;s athletic fields, outpacing the other cadets, outlifting, outjumping, out-and-out-everything-ing them. &quot;She exhibits superior speed, strength, skill and reflexes- without any assistance from body modification.&quot;</p><p class="double">A few of the pirate captains gasped at this information. GP body modification was among the best available. Only the most successful pirate captains could afford the bribes to get nanite treatments to equal the GP standard.</p><p class="double">&quot;She also seems to have a sixth sense that allows her to detect lies,&quot; Ryoko Baulta continued. &quot;Our agents have had to be very circumspect around her to avoid detection. Prolonged contact with this cadet may make our chief agent&#039;s continued presence at the Academy untenable.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Our agents at the Academy are few and precious,&quot; the Da Ruma chief boomed. &quot;And if this cadet completes her training she will be a deadly threat to our continued business. Therefore she must not be permitted to complete her training.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Understood,&quot; Ryoko Baulta said, not blinking. &quot;Next week her class goes on its freshman cruise. Do you wish me to ensure that she does not return?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You are more valuable in your current duties,&quot; Da Ruma replied. &quot;Other people will take care of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Near the head of the conference table, one particular captain licked his thin lips in anticipation of his favorite kind of mission.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">WHUMP.</p><p class="double"><i>Whirrr. Clack.</i></p><p class="double">WHUMP.</p><p class="double"><i>Whirrr. Clack.</i></p><p class="double">Crates whirred through the processing machine, and as they popped up in front of the cadets&#039; stools, each cadet stamped the crate in front of them with a stamper roughly twice as large as any of them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gotta tell ya, girls,&quot; Applejack said, raising the giant cancellation stamp and bringing it back down on the postage label of yet another crate, &quot;this wasn&#039;t th&#039; kind of trainin&#039; I expected on a starship cruise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, it&#039;s work!&quot; Ona na Wyn grinned, bringing down her own stamp. &quot;Work is always good!&quot;</p><p class="double">Brightly Doo had done her Looping counterpart proud, in that somehow she had managed to stamp herself. Twice. &quot;I like this,&quot; she said, bringing the stamp down mostly on the package label this time. &quot;For some reason it seems so... so familiar to me. It&#039;s like I was born to do this!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack had to bite her tongue.</p><p class="double">A whistle shrieked through the cargo area, and the cadets set down the stamps, shut down the float-pallets, and stepped away from their work stations. &quot;Shift&#039;s over,&quot; Applejack groaned, stretching her legs. &quot;Time to eat!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Muffins!&quot; Brightly grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Steak!&quot; Ona barked.</p><p class="double"><i>Leg cramps,</i> Applejack groaned to herself. She was NOT built to spend four hours at a time perched on a stool moving nothing below the waist. Oh, for an apple tree. Anthropoid or not, she wanted to buck a tree something fierce. Forty acres would just about work out the cramps.</p><p class="double">Before the cadets could move towards the galley, red lights began flashing, followed by sirens. <i>&quot;Battle stations, battle stations,&quot;</i> a voice boomed on the PA. <i>&quot;This ship is under pirate attack. All cadets report to your cabins immediately and remain there until curfew is lifted. All other crew report to battle stations.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;No steak?&quot; Ona whined.</p><p class="double">&quot;No muffins?&quot; Brightly looked a little like Ona.</p><p class="double"><i>No movement,</i> Applejack sighed. <i>Ah well, probably just a drill anyway. </i>&quot;C&#039;mon, girls,&quot; she said, tugging her roommates along. &quot;If this is a drill, we&#039;ll get stuck with cleanup duty if we&#039;re the last ones in our cabins.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There were three of them. They had different names (Alan, Barry and Cohen) and looked nothing alike, but for all practical purposes they shared one brain between them. They were so interchangeable that they alternated stations on the bridge each day with no one noticing, least of all the captain.</p><p class="double">&quot;Visual ID on the ship!&quot; Seriyo Tennan shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Visual coming up now!&quot; Barry responded, keying in the order.</p><p class="double">The main screen lit up with a view of a sleek purple space cruiser, its bridge shaped in a golden crest of arms.</p><p class="double">&quot;Th-th-that&#039;s Ryoko Baulta&#039;s ship!!&quot; Barry gasped.</p><p class="double">&quot;The lovely Ryoko Baulta!&quot; Alan cooed.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Pirate Idol of the GP three years running!&quot; Cohen added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Activate weapons! Raise shields!&quot; Seriyo shouted. &quot;Establish weapons lock on the pirate!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Opening hailing frequencies!&quot; Barry shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yoo-hoo, Ryoko!&quot; Alan shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re all waiting for you, Ryoko!&quot; Cohen added.</p><p class="double">The face that popped up on the viewscreen was most definitely NOT Ryoko Baulta. Or female.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You have a person called Yoshiko Fujiringo on board,&quot;</i> the pirate growled, eyes almost shut, arms folded, glaring down at the GP ship&#039;s bridge from the screen. <i>&quot;If you surrender her to us peacefully we will let your ship continue unmolested. If you resist we will take her by force, along with anything else we choose to take.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;The Galaxy Police does not surrender its cadets to common pirates!&quot; Seriyo shouted. &quot;Not even cadets as uncouth and barbaric as the insubordinate Fujiringo!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean... no Ryoko?&quot; Alan asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ryoko&#039;s just too busy to talk, right?&quot; Barry added.</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s still on board, isn&#039;t she?&quot; Cohen finished.</p><p class="double">The pirate on the viewscreen didn&#039;t budge, but a vein on his forehead pulsed visibly. <i>&quot;Captain Baulta is not on board!&quot;</i> he snapped. <i>&quot;If you can&#039;t take this seriously, here&#039;s something to snap you back to your senses!&quot;</i> The viewscreen switched back to the view ahead, which showed the pirate cruiser coming to bear on the GP ship.</p><p class="double">A few flickers of light later, the GP ship rocked with several direct hits.</p><p class="double">&quot;Main reactor offline!&quot; Alan shouted. &quot;Power to shields and weapons has been cut off!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Return fire!&quot; Seriyo shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Owing to the fact that there is no power to the weapons,&quot; Barry said, &quot;we are unable to return fire!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Return fire!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We are currently unable to return fire,&quot; Cohen reported, &quot;due to the fact that the weapons systems are without power!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Return fire!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cohen turned to look at his longtime colleagues. &quot;He really doesn&#039;t get it, does he?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">The other two interchangables shook their heads in solemn agreement.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Right,</i> Applejack thought as the ship shook, <i>this ain&#039;t no buckin&#039; drill.</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Cadets remain in your cabins,&quot;</i> the announcer repeated. <i>&quot;All other hands prepare to repel boarders.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;all girls stay here,&quot; Applejack told her roommates. &quot;I ain&#039;t goin&#039; ta sit on my hoov... my hands when other folks are in danger.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re coming with you!&quot; Brightly grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah! Just tell us what to do!&quot; Ona agreed.</p><p class="double">&quot;I just TOLD y&#039;all what to do,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;If we were all graduates it&#039;d be another thing, but I&#039;m th&#039; only one of th&#039; three of us with fightin&#039; experience. Please, stay put, all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">They didn&#039;t like it, but Applejack&#039;s look kept them in the cabin until she shut and locked the door behind her.</p><p class="double">Next to the cabin door was a communications panel. A few keystrokes, and a bypassed security system later <i>(thanks for th&#039; tips, li&#039;l sis),</i> Applejack had a line open to the bridge. &quot;Cadet Fujiringo reportin&#039;, Captain,&quot; she said. &quot;Tell me where th&#039; varmints are boardin&#039; from. I&#039;ll counterattack an&#039; drive &#039;em off!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Countermanded!&quot; Seriyo shouted. &quot;Even if an untrained, uncivilized brute such as yourself were qualified for combat, I could never order a single fighter to take on an entire pirate crew!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Firstly, sir,&quot; Applejack drawled, &quot;I wasn&#039;t askin&#039; permission. I was tellin&#039; ya what I&#039;m gonna do.&quot;</p><p class="double">While Seriyo spluttered on the other end of the connection, she put her fingers through a well-practiced set of motions. She was slightly surprised she got it right the first time; she&#039;d had much more practice doing it with hooves than hands.</p><p class="double">&quot;Second,&quot; a hundred Applejacks replied, their voices echoing through the empty corridors of the cadet quarters, &quot;who said there was only gonna be one o&#039; me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shadow clones: the second most useful trick Applejack had picked up from the Naruto Loops, right after tree-walking. Made harvests a snap.</p><p class="double">The boarding party that stormed down the plank never knew what hit them, nor why it kept vanishing in a puff of smoke any time one of them landed a solid hit in return.</p><p class="double">The crew that remained on board the pirate cruiser found out in a most definite way what hit them. And what kicked them. And what shackled them with thrown handcuffs that strongly resembled horseshoes. And what hogtied them in what seemed like an endless supply of lassoes.</p><p class="double">Ten minutes later the pirates&#039; bridge crew recalled its boarding party with orders to re-take its engine room.</p><p class="double">Ten minutes after that the pirates&#039; bridge crew called the GP ship to request terms of surrender.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aha!&quot; Seriyo shouted. &quot;You finally recognize the superior fighting talents of Seriyo Tennan!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Who? No!&quot;</i> the gruff pirate commander replied. <i>&quot;But we want you to call off this lunatic you put aboard our ship before she does to us whatever she&#039;s done to the rest of our crew!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Seriyo scowled. &quot;Embarrassed by that insubordinate Earthling again,&quot; he muttered. In a louder voice he added, &quot;I can only accept unconditional surrender, of course. Pirates must face proper justice.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;So long as proper justice doesn&#039;t include that young woman,&quot;</i> the pirate replied, <i>&quot;we&#039;ll take our chances with the judge!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Captain!&quot; Alan shouted from his console. &quot;New ship coming out of warp!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Break away from the pirate cruiser!&quot; Seriyo shouted. &quot;Come about to face the new enemy!&quot;</p><p class="double">On the screen, one of the pirate crewmen shouted, <i>&quot;Oh God, she&#039;s broken through the do-&quot;</i> The signal broke up in static, replaced by a demonic-looking battleship, black with red highlights, looking like a cross between a steam locomotive and a demon from Hell.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s the <i>Daedalos!</i>&quot; Barry gasped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tarrant Shank&#039;s ship!&quot; Cohen shuddered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shank takes no prisoners!&quot; Alan finished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Come about, I said!&quot; Seriyo snapped. &quot;Bring all weapons to bear on the newcomer and prepare to open fire!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re still on auxiliary power!&quot; Cohen said. &quot;Shields and weapons are inactive!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then ram the enemy!&quot; Seriyo said. &quot;The GP will never give up without a fight!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir!!&quot; Alan protested. &quot;The <i>Daedalos</i> is specifically armored for ramming and grappling tactics. Our ship isn&#039;t built for that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We have no weapons! We have no shields!&quot; Seriyo shouted. &quot;But in the face of certain destruction by a merciless enemy, never let it be said that the GP went down without a fight! Ramming speed, my men! Let&#039;s show Shank what the Galaxy Police are made of!&quot;</p><p class="double">The three interchangables went into conference. &quot;Got any better ideas?&quot; Barry asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dead is dead, either way,&quot; Cohen moaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;So we might as well die fighting, right?&quot; Alan grinned.</p><p class="double">The other two nodded, then turned to their consoles.</p><p class="double">The Galaxy Police transport ship ripped away from the purple cruiser&#039;s boarding ramps, tearing the gangway apart. In a rather anemic burst of speed it staggered towards the oncoming <i>Daedalos...</i> which passed it by effortlessly, bearing down on the cruiser. Massive guns crackled with energy, then spat out a lance of red destruction that slammed into the disabled cruiser, sending it in a trail of flame and smoke towards a nearby desert planet.</p><p class="double">Satisfied that the mission was complete, the <i>Daedalos</i> cloaked, vanishing into the blackness of space.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wasn&#039;t he one of you guys?&quot; Applejack shouted at the pirate commander as both struggled to put flames out on the bridge.</p><p class="double">&quot;Our mission was to capture you!&quot; the pirate replied. &quot;Tarrant Shank just decided to finish the job himself!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He wasn&#039;t doin&#039; nothin&#039; y&#039;all weren&#039;t tryin&#039; ta do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We only kill in self-defense!&quot; the pirate snapped. &quot;Captain Ryoko doesn&#039;t believe in pointless death. Shank ENJOYS it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;all are <i>pirates</i>,&quot; Applejack commented, tossing aside an empty fire extinguisher and looking for another one. &quot;Ain&#039;t killin&#039; in your job description somewhere?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We are pirates with honor,&quot; the commander corrected Applejack. &quot;We only steal from the rich and the insured. We don&#039;t kidnap for ransom and we do not kill when at all avoidable!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;wanna explain me, then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Orders from Da Ruma himself. You pose a threat to our guild- to all pirates everywhere, if you become a GP officer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks for that,&quot; Applejack muttered. &quot;That&#039;s th&#039; last of th&#039; fire extinguishers. Any hope of bringin&#039; th&#039; fire suppression systems back on-line? Navigation? Anythin&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">The commander looked at the one other member of the bridge crew still on his feet, who shook his head solemnly. &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#039;re down to emergency life support. We won&#039;t survive the crash.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack closed her eyes for a moment, steadied herself, and nodded. &quot;Right,&quot; she said. &quot;Then it&#039;s up to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Up to you?&quot; the pirate commander asked. &quot;What are you going to do? What CAN you do?&quot;</p><p class="double">The Element of Honesty appeared around Applejack&#039;s neck. &quot;Magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Alicorn magic, to control the winds of the desert planet&#039;s atmosphere, bringing clouds together in the hot, dry air to cushion the descent.</p><p class="double">The Force, to stablilize the spin and tumble of the pirate cruiser and to put it at the proper angle for re-entry.</p><p class="double">Shadow clones, rushing through the ship, putting out small fires with their bodies, attempting repairs to the emergency thrusters to regain minimal control of the ship.</p><p class="double">Spells learned at Hogwarts and in Seirun and Arda, lifting the ship, slowing it down when the emergency thrusters proved irreparable.</p><p class="double">Earthbending, reaching below the ship to reshape a massive section of hard rocky ground into a ramp, a pit, and then a runoff zone filled with loose sand and gravel.</p><p class="double">Dozens of tricks, talents, skills and spells learned through all those Loops standing behind Twilight, being the one supporting the egghead, being the one going along with whatever one of her friends came up with, added with the stubbornness born into every Apple and the will forged by enduring who knew how many million Loops without going stark raving mad.</p><p class="double">All together, it was enough to bring the ship down.</p><p class="double">It would never go up again, but it came down safely, with no further loss of life.</p><p class="double">After the shrieks of armor plating on rock died away, after the last shuddering bump and lurch of the ship scraping against the planet&#039;s surface ended, the unwounded members of the pirate crew, led by their commander, gathered around Applejack, who stood motionless, eyes closed, arms spread, on the bridge.</p><p class="double">Just as one curious pirate reached a hand forward to touch her to see if she was alive or not, her eyes opened up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Jus&#039; ta be clear &#039;bout this,&quot; she mumbled, &quot;y&#039;all are still under arrest. Un&#039;erstand?&quot;</p><p class="double">All the pirates except the commander took two very hasty steps backwards. The commander, arms folded, nodded solemnly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good,&quot; Applejack muttered. &quot;S&#039;long we got that str...&quot;</p><p class="double">She hit the deck, fast asleep, before she could finish the word.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the personal aide to the Jurai Sector director of the Galaxy Police, Erma was in the perfect position to hear about everything first. Sometimes it could be heard from the other side of the teleport booth.</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you MEAN you didn&#039;t conduct a search for survivors?&quot; Airi&#039;s eyes bulged from her face. A vein in ther temple bulged to match. On the viewscreen, even that confirmed idiot Seriyo Tennan had the sense to be afraid.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately, he didn&#039;t have enough sense to stop digging his own grave. &quot;Ma&#039;am, we spent hours on combat patrol seeking to re-engage the <i>Daedalos.</i> By the time we gave up on that search, no trace remained of the initial pirate vessel. As we had a crew of cadets and valuable cargo, I judged it best to proceed to our destination at best speed rather than waste time verifying that the enemy ship was lost with all hands.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All hands plus one of your cadets, Captain!&quot; Airi&#039;s fist hit her desk, sending one of the mountains of paperwork sliding off in a hissing avalanche. &quot;The Galaxy Police does not leave one of our own behind! At the least you should have held position and awaited reinforcements!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Airi, I-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Kindly report back to the Academy, Tennan,&quot; Airi growled. &quot;If being a gym teacher is all you&#039;re good for, you may as well get back to it! Just stay out of my sight!&quot; Before Seriyo could get another word out she cut the connection, slumping forward and knocking over the rest of the stacks of paperwork. &quot;What am I going to tell Seto? She asks me to slip a student into the Academy, and I lose her on her freshman cruise??&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Madame Director,&quot; Erma said, &quot;please give me a ship. I will undertake the search myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Airi lifted her head from the remnants of the paper piles. &quot;Really, Erma?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am a Detective First Class, am I not?&quot; Erma said. &quot;I&#039;m fully qualified for command. If not, at least give me a hyper-capable yacht and I&#039;ll conduct the search solo.&quot;</p><p class="double">A corner of Airi&#039;s mouth turned up. &quot;Anxious to retrieve your lost student, I take it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No more so than yourself, ma&#039;am,&quot; Erma replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ll leave it at that then... Captain.&quot; Airi said. &quot;And when you return, we can discuss how a pipeline of information can be made to run two ways. Am I clear?&quot;</p><p class="double">Erma froze for just a moment, sweat trickling through her fur. &quot;Er... crystal clear, ma&#039;am.&quot;</p><p class="double">The instant Erma disappeared from the teleport booth, Airi keyed open the private channel to Lady Seto. &quot;Seto? This is Airi. I&#039;m afraid you&#039;ll have to move up your plans for Baulta quite a bit...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Erma double-checked the galactic coordinates... then triple-checked them.</p><p class="double">Star? Check.</p><p class="double">Planet? Well, yes.</p><p class="double">Nearly barren desert world, uninhabited? Not so much. Try forest planet... with the forest arranged in suspiciously orderly rows and lines of trees. Plenty of rain clouds, the few sullen lakes of the desert swelling into oceans...</p><p class="double"><i>How in the galaxy does someone terraform a planet this radically, without tools or spaceflight capacity, in three weeks?</i></p><p class="double">At least the forest proved that Cadet Fujiringo was alive. None of Ryoko Baulta&#039;s crew had any capacity to do anything like this, but Fujiringo&#039;s mysterious capabilities... well, were mysterious. There was nothing that said she <i>couldn&#039;t</i> do this, and absolutely nobody else could have.</p><p class="double">&quot;Helm, take us down to treetop level above the tallest and densest trees,&quot; Erma said. &quot;I think we&#039;ll find our lost sheep there.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;all got here jus&#039; in time, ma&#039;am,&quot; an exhausted looking Applejack said, saluting. &quot;We were down to our last roll of toilet paper.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lucky for you, then,&quot; Erma nodded. &quot;And you had no trouble keeping over two hundred pirates under your authority?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, once I made it clear what they could an&#039; couldn&#039;t get away with,&quot; Applejack shrugged, &quot;it was pretty easy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s no longer your worry, cadet.&quot; Erma smiled gently. &quot;A Galactic Army ship will arrive soon to take charge of this... er... impromptu prison colony. You, however, are two weeks behind on your coursework. You&#039;re going to leave immediately with me for the Academy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, ma&#039;am!&quot;</p><p class="double">Erma blinked. &quot;I beg your pardon... <i>cadet?</i>&quot; She intended to put a dangerous emphasis on the rank, but instead it gave away her curiosity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ma&#039;am, it would be improper for me to leave until custody of the prisoners is formally transferred to a permanent custody officer. Furthermore, I would have to be satisfied that the officer in question was capable of-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have to remind you, cadet, that you are not yet a full officer in the Galaxy Police.&quot; Erma drew herself up. &quot;Without a ship, these prisoners have no means of escape. We will leave sufficient supplies to last until the relief ship arrives. But in the meantime I am ordering you to come with me!&quot; <i>And now,</i> Erma thought, <i>what do you do about that?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, ma&#039;am,&quot; Applejack replied. &quot;But under these circumstances I must invoke Article Twenty-Nine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Erma&#039;s eyes widened. She didn&#039;t need to look that one up; she&#039;d lived in fear of it ever since she first put on the uniform.</p><p class="double"><i>Article Twenty-Nine: In the event that there is reasonable suspicion that a fellow Galaxy Police officer is an imposter, every effort shall be made to validate or disprove the identity of the accused; and if proof of imposture is found, the imposter is to be placed under arrest at once, chain of command notwithstanding.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a dangerous accusation to make, Cadet Fujiringo.&quot; Erma&#039;s smile had vanished, and she didn&#039;t bother trying to fake one. &quot;Shall we go talk to Airi about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No need, ma&#039;am,&quot; Applejack said, holding her hands in a loop before her. &quot;I reckon we can settle it right here’n now.&quot; Applejack&#039;s hands glowed, and a slow wave of light burst from them and pushed forward, enveloping Erma.</p><p class="double">When it faded, Erma was gone, and Ryoko Baulta remained.</p><p class="double">&quot;I kinda had a feelin&#039; ever since we met,&quot; Applejack continued. &quot;But when you tried to leave prisoners unguarded an&#039; uncared for, that was what made me decide. So I tried a &#039;dispel magic&#039; spell I learned from watchin&#039; a friend of mine. Good ta know it works here, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rrrrrgh,&quot; Ryoko Baulta groaned. &quot;Fine, fine, right answer, Cadet... but for the wrong reasons!&quot; She threw her hands into the air. &quot;A Galaxy Army ship is going to be here in hours, and I really AM supposed to take you back to the Academy at once!&quot; Ryoko shook her head. &quot;I only asked to lead the search because I have a responsibility to my crew. If anybody else had shown up instead, their orders would have been exactly the same!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; Applejack shrugged. &quot;Don&#039;t change the fact that you&#039;re under arrest... <i>ma&#039;am.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid she isn&#039;t, Applejack dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">Both Applejack and Ryoko spun on their heels in time to see Seto Kamiki Jurai, the Devil Princess herself, step out from behind a tree. &quot;Now, whatever am I going to do with you two?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;What do you mean, repatriation?&quot; The question leaped from both throats simultaneously.</p><p class="double">&quot;How dare you kidnap my crew?&quot; Ryoko leaned well into Lady Seto&#039;s personal space, shouting at the top of her lungs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Kidnap your crew?&quot; Applejack didn&#039;t crowd Seto, but she did get pretty close. &quot;You&#039;re stealin&#039; my prisoners outta custody, is what you&#039;re doin&#039;!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, now, ladies,&quot; Seto said, stepping back and waving her fan in supplication. &quot;I appreciate that you both have a duty to fulfill, but I have my own duty... to the peace and stability of the galaxy.&quot; Half-hiding her face behind her fan, she looked at Ryoko Baulta. &quot;And that peace requires that you, my dear pirate captain, retrieve your crew and return to raiding the spaceways.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wh-wh-what??&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve discussed the matter with Airi and Mikami,&quot; Seto continued, naming the second and third ranking officers in the Galaxy Police. &quot;We all agree that the best way to reduce the threat of piracy at this time is to have someone on the inside. Someone who could, for example, feed us information on the location of Tarrant Shank, or the plans of the Da Ruma pirate guild. You know,&quot; she added, &quot;the people who tried to kill your crew rather than allow them to surrender?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ryoko&#039;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Is that your game?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah don&#039;t get it,&quot; Applejack muttered. &quot;Or rather, I get it, but I don&#039;t want it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s politics, of course,&quot; Seto said. &quot;More specifically, it&#039;s a plan I&#039;ve been working on for fifty years now. If it succeeds, the threat of piracy in the galaxy will be reduced to a shadow of what it is now.&quot; Seto&#039;s smile vanished with a snap of her fan as she added, &quot;And believe me when I say I have ample reason to see piracy eradicated from this galaxy by any means necessary.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack had been Looked, Stared and glared at by experts, so Seto&#039;s look didn&#039;t faze her. &quot;I&#039;ve seen a lot of things, ma&#039;am,&quot; she said. &quot;An&#039; most of what I&#039;ve seen says that &#039;by any means necessary&#039; is always th&#039; wrong way to do it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not always,&quot; Seto replied. &quot;In any case, the decision is Captain Baulta&#039;s, not yours. Your orders, from the GP Marshal herself, are to relinquish custody of all your prisoners to me.&quot; She raised an eyebrow and added, &quot;Are you going to risk your career by trying to stop me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean, risk my chance at one&#039;o them royal trees of yours?&quot; Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">Ryoko&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lady Seto, I am an honest po... woman. An&#039; that don&#039;t just mean I&#039;m bad at lyin&#039;.”</p><p class="double">Ryoko Baulta dashed between Seto and Applejack, facing the latter. “Are you NUTS? Shut up, shut up, shut UP! You’ve been offered a royal tree? NOBODY outside Jurai’s allowed a royal tree! And you’re going to throw away the biggest honor in the galaxy on a point of principle??”</p><p class="double">“Shut up,” Applejack grumbled, stepping around Baulta for a direct look at Seto. “If th&#039; choice is between doin&#039; my duty an&#039; losin&#039; th&#039; prize, or gettin&#039; th&#039; prize dishonestly, then for me there ain&#039;t no choice at all.&quot; Applejack stepped forward, looking up into the taller woman&#039;s narrowed eyes. &quot;You ain&#039;t takin&#039; my prisoners. You know what you can do with your tree.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seto raised an eyebrow. “Is that your final answer?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack looked down at the seed in her hands, speechless.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, there&#039;s your Shojiki,&quot; Seto smiled. &quot;Now that the bonding ceremony is completed, there shouldn&#039;t be any difficulties, but Tsunami says it would probably be best if you wait to construct her containment unit until you have a Loop that begins well before your normal baseline start... whatever that means,&quot; she said with a shrug. &quot;I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m sad or relieved that I won&#039;t remember all this when history resets.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack still continued to stare.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Tsunami made that seed especially for you. She says it doesn&#039;t exist in baseline, though I don&#039;t know why that might be important. You could say something like, &#039;thank you.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I still can&#039;t believe you&#039;re actually doin&#039; this,&quot; Applejack said at last.</p><p class="double">&quot;You stood on your integrity to your superiors, right on up to Airi herself. That should be rewarded.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But this still feels wrong,&quot; Applejack said.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s because you&#039;re looking at it the wrong way.&quot; Seto jabbed her ever-present fan at Applejack. &quot;I never said the gift of a royal tree was a <i>quid pro quo</i>. You <i>assumed</i> that. Jurai does not bribe people with royal trees... ever.&quot; That fan snapped open again, and Seto stared over it. &quot;The kind of person who would accept such a bribe is wholly unsuitable to be a tree&#039;s partner in the first place.</p><p class="double">&quot;You didn&#039;t get Shojiki because you earned her. You get Shojiki because you deserve her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Applejack said quietly. &quot;Well... that&#039;s all right, then.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s good. Now then, before you return to the Academy...&quot; Seto keyed up the image of a less-than-impressive young man in Jurai noble robes. &quot;Since we have quite some time before history resets, why don&#039;t you spend part of it as part of the Jurai royal families? I can arrange an <i>omiai </i>with this eligible young man this very evening!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er...&quot; Applejack wondered if she could outrun Seto&#039;s courtiers and guards all the way to the spaceport.</p><p class="double">The mental laughter from the seed in her hands didn&#039;t help her discomfort.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A group of colorful ponies sat in the cellar of a barn, sipping from drinks served by the bartender and listening to the pony in the cowboy hat telling her story.</p><p class="double">&quot;... an&#039; I retired after making Detective First Class, which is about as high as you can go before they start stickin’ ya behind desks, an&#039; spent the rest of the Loop learning about Jurai ship construction and royal tree maintenance.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that seed is still good?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked, reaching a hoof towards the open presentation box. Applejack swiftly shut the box and stuck it back in her subspace pocket.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow, in Tenchi&#039;s baseline, one of his friends discovers a royal seed that&#039;s millions of years old and still vital and powerful,&quot; Twilight Sparkle said. &quot;Royal trees live off the power differential between universes. Even being in a subspace pocket is enough to keep it viable. In fact, its power supply is practically limitless.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what they told me,&quot; Applejack nodded. &quot;In their home universe they draw off of Tsunami herself, but elsewhere they get on all right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, when ya gonna build your spaceship, huh?&quot; Pinkie Pie asked. &quot;&#039;Cause I need to plan the You&#039;re-A-Sapling-Now-Welcome-To-Equestria Party!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m waitin&#039; for th&#039; next Sisters-type Loop I have,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;Two thousand-odd years should be plenty enough head start to prevent any de-aging glitches Yggdrasil might throw at us. An&#039; then...&quot; Applejack grinned. &quot;Then Shojiki an&#039; I are gonna want a rematch of that Battleship game you won backalong, Twi.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paled a little, trying to think of what technology or magic, in all her Loops, could counter Light Hawk Wings without vaporizing Shojiki or triggering a Loop Crash... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">117.2 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><b>And the Rest Loop: Prologue</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Twilight asked the other Loopers gathered around the back of the barn at Sweet Apple Acres. Unfortunately none of them was Big MacIntosh or Berry Punch, so the bar wasn&#039;t going to open this Loop... no matter how badly Twilight needed it.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s the matter, purple plot?&quot; Gilda asked. &quot;Do we not measure up to your standards, or something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no, that&#039;s not it at all,&quot; Twilight said hurriedly, &quot;but... well, last Loop was kind of rough on me, all right? Almost Bureau bad. And I was hoping that Applejack or Fluttershy or Pinkie might be Awake so I could talk it out...&quot; Even Rainbow Dash or Rarity would have done, really. She really wanted at least one of her closest friends with her for a while. Though most of these Loopers were also friends... well, Angel Bunny was stretching the point, but still... it wasn&#039;t the same thing. There were her other friends, and then there were <i>the girls</i>, and she couldn&#039;t explain it better than that.</p><p class="double">&quot;If you&#039;ll accept the word of this&#039;n,&quot; Zecora said soothingly, &quot;all of us are willing to listen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... thanks, but it&#039;s not the same,&quot; Twilight said. Looking at Angel Bunny, who had pulled out a notepad and pencil from his subspace pocket, she added, &quot;In some cases, REALLY not the same.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I hate to push things along,&quot; Ivory Scroll said, &quot;but what is the plan for this Loop? Did you have any project, any experiment, any pranks in mind? We really need to know now- it&#039;s only about eighteen hours until Nightmare Moon&#039;s return.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, everyone,&quot; Twilight said quietly. &quot;I think I need a bit of a rest. Not a full vacation, but I&#039;m pretty much gonna go through the motions this Loop. You know, autopilot. You all do whatever you want.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight was less than reassured by the five very evil grins that appeared on the faces of the Mayor, Zecora, Cheerilee, Angel Bunny and Gilda.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>And the Rest Loop: Friendship is Magic</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had made an early evening of it at Pinkie&#039;s surprise party. The unAwake party pony had, for once, been quite understanding when, after making the rounds to greet and thank her new (very, very old) friends, Twilight had plead exhaustion after her trip to Ponyville and her work overseeing preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. She had been a little less understanding when Twilight spotted another pony spiking the punch, took the bottle of hard cider away from her, and went to bed with it... but Pinkie didn&#039;t do anything more than give Twilight a look of sad disapproval just before Twilight shut the door.</p><p class="double">Half the remaining bottle had been enough to put Twilight to sleep, and she&#039;d rather hoped to sleep at least until after Nightmare Moon had been and gone. She&#039;d dropped a couple of hints about a prophecy she&#039;d been researching, how a clue should be in this library, if only she had the energy to follow up. Nightmare Moon would give her little speech and flee, and her friends would come to the library seeking answers... after Twilight had had a long, restorative night&#039;s sleep in her safe, peaceful home.</p><p class="double">So when the knocking on the bedroom door woke her up only a handful of hours after she&#039;d gone to bed, Twilight woke up neck-deep in confusion and only got deeper. &quot;Bwah? Whah? Who? Who&#039;s there?&quot;</p><p class="double">The bedroom door opened to admit the sound of the still-rocking party and Ivory Scroll. &quot;There you are, Miss Sparkle!&quot; she cried. &quot;We&#039;ve got to hurry! You&#039;re due to introduce Princess Celestia in just seventeen minutes!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am? I what? Wait, aren&#039;t you- I mean-&quot; Still half asleep, she struggled to formulate a coherent thought as the mayor and Cheerilee herded her out of bed, out of the library, and over to Ponyville&#039;s town hall, along with a trickle of other ponies already shifting from one party-in-progress to the party-about-to-begin. Every time Twilight managed to get enough words in a row in her brain, like <i>Since when do I introduce the Princess?</i> or <i>What do you think you&#039;re doing?</i> or <i>What the larch is going on here?</i>, Cheerilee would fuss with her mane or Ivory Scroll would go into a rapid-fire monologue about how proud Ponyville was to have Princess Celestia&#039;s right hand pony on site at this, Ponyville&#039;s finest hour. The combination of this and the continuous pushing and bumping kept Twilight both mentally and physically off-balance until she was actually standing on the stage in front of practically every single pony in Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now, to introduce our beloved ruler, we have the personal student of Princess Celestia, the most talented unicorn to ever attend the School for Gifted Unicorns, Twilight Sparkle!&quot; With that Ivory Scroll and Cheerilee stepped out of the spotlight, and Twilight was alone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... um...&quot;<i> This is a prank. It has to be a prank. But I have NO idea if I&#039;m the target, or where it&#039;s going to come from. All I can do is play along with it.</i> &quot;Er, thank you all. I have to say that in the one day I&#039;ve spent in Ponyville I&#039;ve been made so welcome, I feel like I&#039;ve lived here for milli- er, for hundreds of years.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Some of us have, dearie!&quot; Granny Smith shouted from the audience, to much laughter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, yeah,&quot; Twilight smiled ruefully. &quot;Anyway, I can&#039;t think of any town friendlier than Ponyville in all my travels with Celestia as her student. And I certainly can&#039;t think of any town in Equestria more deserving to host the one thousandth Summer Sun Celebration!&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire town cheered, whistled, and pounded its hooves in applause.</p><p class="double">&quot;And so that we can get started on that, allow me to introduce the ruler of Equestria, a powerful alicorn, a wise monarch... and the best teacher a pony could possibly have...&quot; Twilight gestured behind her to the balcony where Celestia, she knew, would not be. &quot;Princess Celestia!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s birds trilled their fanfare, Rarity raised the curtains, and sure enough, as usual the balcony was empty.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... Princess Celestia?&quot; Twilight called out, trying to sound concerned. She glanced out the western window... yes, the Mare in the Moon had vanished... and more to the immediate point, so had Ivory Scroll. <i>Guess I&#039;ll have to deliver the line...</i> &quot;Please keep calm, everypony, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a good explanation.&quot;</p><p class="double">One of the guards looked around the balcony and called down, &quot;She&#039;s GONE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooooh, she&#039;s good!&quot; Pinkie chirped. &quot;They must teach that sort of thing in Canterlot!&quot;</p><p class="double">Laughter echoed through the room, silencing the murmurs of the nervous ponies inside. A swirl of smoke twinkling with the light of distant stars coalesced on the balcony into the shape of a midnight-blue alicorn clad in armor- Nightmare Moon. &quot;Greetings, my faithful subjects,&quot; she said. &quot;Thank you for being here to welcome me back from my exile.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack stepped forward. &quot;Who the hay are y&#039;all, an&#039; what have ya done wtih-&quot;</p><p class="double">The loud <i>thock</i> of a throwing star embedding itself into the balcony railing above cut Applejack&#039;s question short. Nightmare Moon flinched, leaned forward to look, then flinched back again as a pencil embedded itself into the railing twice as deeply as the throwing star.</p><p class="double">Twin spotlights lit up balconies high up along the sides of the town hall. Two earth ponies clad in black ninja suits from muzzle to tail stood in the spotlights, one fanning out a large sheaf of paper, the other posing with an array of pencils in her hoof. Each pony also wore a green sleeveless jacket and a headband with a metal device attached, engraved with the swirled leaf symbol of Konohagakure.</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned as she noticed the pince-nez glasses perched on the paper-wielding ninja pony&#039;s masked muzzle. Of course.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Third Hokage sends her regards, Nightmare Moon,&quot; the pince-nez ninja said in Ivory Scroll&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Fifth Hokage sends her regards, Nightmare Moon,&quot; the pencil-wielding ninja echoed, speaking in Cheerilee&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;For the honor of the Ninja Village Hidden in the Leaves, we shall defeat you!&quot; the two chorused.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon glanced from one ninja to the other. &quot;You&#039;re having me on.&quot; Twin blasts of black magic speared out towards the spotlights.</p><p class="double">The ninjas were already in the air before the magic blasts struck home, leaping from the sides of the great hall straight onto the balcony where Nightmare Moon stood. &quot;Nightmare Moon, you have been served,&quot; Ninja Scroll said, sticking a large, elaborately calligraphed scroll on Nightmare Moon&#039;s chest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please sign for receipt,&quot; Ninjilee added, shoving a pencil down the front of Nightmare Moon&#039;s plastron.</p><p class="double">Both ninjas leaped away a split second before the pencil and scroll glowed and exploded, engulfing the evil alicorn in fire and smoke. Ninja Scroll tossed two bundles of papers into the air; they landed in two rows along the central aisle of the hall. One string of papers read: THIS WAY TO THE EXIT. The other said: YOU DON&#039;T WANT TO BE HERE. Both rows rippled with red lights, guiding the way to the open doors.</p><p class="double">That was the only cue the ponies of Ponyville needed. They skedaddled, shrieking in terror. Twilight found herself carried along with the crowd. The last words she heard as she was pushed outside were Nightmare Moon&#039;s: &quot;THIS MEANS WAR!&quot;</p><p class="double">For several minutes afterwards Twilight and the rest of Ponyville watched as loud explosions, flashes of light, and bolts of midnight magic burst out of one window after another of town hall. Each time some blow or blast shook the building, the building shook a little bit more. Finally one loud explosion shook the town hall so hard it kept shaking, bits falling off, loud crunching and groaning sound echoing from within.</p><p class="double">Two night-clad figures jumped out of upper-story windows and vanished into the eternal night... just before the whole building collapsed to the ground in a pile of wood scraps and tattered banners.</p><p class="double">A few seconds later the moon set and the sun rose, illuminating a single dark blue hoof stretched through a gap in what had once been the town hall&#039;s roof. It was waving a white flag.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, Princess Celestia,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;but I honestly can&#039;t tell you who defeated Nightmare Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a shame,&quot; the princess replied. &quot;I owe whoever managed the feat a great debt... just as I owe you for comforting my sister and helping her let go of her hate and jealousy afterwards.&quot; Nightmare Moon had been a blubbering wreck when the work crews had released her from the rubble pile. It had taken but a few well-chosen words of consolation and encouragement from Twilight, combined with some gratuitous fangirling about her favorite constellations, to finish the job of purging the Nightmare from Princess Luna.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem. Speaking of debt...&quot; Ivory Scroll, wearing her best ascot, mane impeccably styled, stepped forward and presented a scroll to Celestia.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s this? ... bill for services rendered... expenses include one town hall... early settlement would oblige??&quot; Celestia&#039;s eyes widened as she looked at the numbers carefully and exactly aligned down the right hand margin of the scroll.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, Princess, we don&#039;t expect you to pay us directly. It would be most uncouth for a princess to carry a checkbook around like a commoner.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... yes... I mean... we shall have to discuss this. Luna, have you- Luna?&quot; Celestia looked around for her sister, who had vanished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; Ivory Scroll continued. &quot;Our town&#039;s public counselor recommended community service as a therapeutic means of reacquainting Princess Luna with the modern world while easing her guilt. Specifically, as teaching assistant at our town&#039;s school.&quot; Ivory Scroll shrugged. &quot;The counselor&#039;s also our schoolmistress. When you live in a small town, you have to exercise all your talents.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah... yes... well, Luna always had a soft spot for children in her heart. She should do well.&quot; Celestia raised a hoof at a particular item on the scroll. &quot;Now, if we could discuss some of these estimates...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight didn&#039;t know if she was going to burst out laughing or if her head was just going to burst, but either way she decided the time had come to make a discreet withdrawal.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>And the Rest Loop: Bridle Gossip</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared out the window of Sugarcube Corner at Zecora. Normally, in a baseline run, Zecora would make her first appearance in a grey hooded cloak, trying (and failing) to avoid calling attention to herself. This time... &quot;What kind of mare wears a tuxedo, cloak and top hat to go shopping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, right??&quot; Pinkie Pie gasped. &quot;She&#039;s obviously evil! EEEEVIL! I even wrote a song about it! Wanna hear it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope,&quot; Twilight said, making Pinkie&#039;s ears droop. &quot;I&#039;d rather get it straight from the zebra&#039;s mouth.&quot; It took a bit of a struggle, with five mares trying to drag her back through the doors, but eventually Twilight got out into the street and walked up to Zecora. The zebra had set up a large cauldron in the middle of the street, built a fire underneath, and now was adding this and that from bags and pouches around her into the mix.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">&quot;My pardon you need not, if you but step into my pot,&quot; Zecora replied with a grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... what? No!&quot; Twilight took a couple of steps backwards. &quot;Miss, I just came out here to prove you&#039;re not the big scary strange person my friends think you are!&quot; She pointed back at her friends, who had reluctantly followed her out. (Pinkie Pie&#039;s hooves were still clamped around Twilight&#039;s tail.)</p><p class="double">&quot;Who am I, I hear you cry?&quot; Zecora grinned. She rose onto her hind legs, doing a kicking dance, twirling the spoon from the pot and occasionally poking Twilight with it as she sang.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m an evil enchantress</i></p><p><i>And I do evil dances</i></p><p><i>When I look in your eyes</i></p><p><i>I can put you in trances</i></p><p><i>Then you know what I&#039;ll do?</i></p><p><i>I&#039;ll mix an evil brew</i></p><p><i>And then gobble you up</i></p><p><i>In a big tasty stew</i></p><p class="double">&quot;So... WATCH OUT!&quot; she grinned, jabbing Twilight in the barrel once more with the spoon before giving the greenish mixture in the pot another stir.</p><p class="double">&quot;See? See? I told you she was evil!&quot; Pinkie shouted, pointing a hoof at Zecora. &quot;She&#039;s so evil she even stole my song! And this must be the big tasty stew she&#039;s going to eat us in!&quot; She leaned over the edge of the cauldron and dipped a hoof into the mix. She licked off the residue and made a face.</p><p class="double">&quot;GAH! This stew isn&#039;t tasty at all!&quot; she shouted. &quot;It&#039;s... split pea soup! Yuck!!&quot; Pinkie pointed her other hoof back at Zecora. &quot;Worst... evil enchantress... EVER!&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora sighed and took off her top hat. &quot;&#039;Tis true at evil I sorely fail,&quot; she said. &quot;All I can do is make people fit and hale. It&#039;s a shame for a zebra witch to fail to be a total <i>wicked pony.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>Really?</i> Twilight thought. <i>This is the best gag you can come up with? Well... I admit turning the tables on Pinkie is pretty good, but... it just feels like this is... lacking something...</i> Out loud she said, &quot;You know, you don&#039;t have to be an evil enchantress. You could just be a master of herbal remedies and folk magic. And I&#039;m sure that once the town has learned that Pinkie Pie&#039;s shamed you into giving up your evil ways-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, ya <i>have</i> quit bein&#039; evil, right?&quot; Applejack interrupted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed my heart was never in it; I lost the fight before I could begin it,&quot; Zecora replied. &quot;My wicked ways I do abjure, and Pinkie&#039;s protest was my cure.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack turned to face the row of buildings behind them. &quot;Y&#039;all can come out now!&quot; she shouted. &quot;Pinkie beat th&#039; evil witch of th&#039; Everfree, an&#039; she&#039;s promised ta never be evil again!&quot;</p><p class="double">Doors slammed open up and down the street, and cheering ponies rushed out, picking up both Pinkie and Zecora and carrying them around the streets of Ponyville, cheering and dancing.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll just make sure your soup doesn&#039;t burn, shall I?&quot; Twilight shouted after them, left alone by the pot. She took a taste from the spoon. &quot;This isn&#039;t actually that bad... could use some salt...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora smiled smugly at the two ponies standing at the door to her hut the next morning. &quot;Swiftly consequences come due, to those who taste an evil brew,&quot; she said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lay off the comedy,&quot; Twilight grumbled, brushing her floppy horn out of the way, &quot;and tell us you have a cure for poison joke poisoning.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie nodded frantically, her voice muffled by the enormous polka-dotted swollen tongue sticking out of her mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought Discord&#039;s posies would make a fine seasoning,&quot; Zecora shrugged. &quot;Although I&#039;m unable to explain my poor reasoning.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Here&#039;s the punchline,</i> Twilight thought. <i>She got us to dose ourselves with the stuff. Lo, I do laugh. Ha. Ha. Ha.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">117.3 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset shifted her weight from hoof to hoof, trying to burn off nervous energy. Maybe she should come back another time. It was late and she&#039;d hate to interrupt anything. And she shouldn&#039;t just spring a visit on ponies like this. And it wasn&#039;t as though she wanted anything very important. And...</p><p class="double">And if she didn&#039;t do something <i>now</i> she doubted she&#039;d have the resolve to do it later.</p><p class="double">Steeling herself, she raised a hoof and knocked on the aging wagon&#039;s door. A moment later a night black mare with a sea green mane poked her head outside. A sequined bow tie was fastened at her neck.</p><p class="double">&quot;The Great and Powerful Trixie is currently- Oh! Sunset!&quot; She threw the door open before leaning back inside and calling out. &quot;Trixie, we&#039;ve got company! Please, make yourself at home,&quot; she added, motioning for Sunset to follow her in.</p><p class="double">The orange mare stepped inside and closed the door behind her. As soon they were free of potential prying eyes the other mare flared green for a moment before Chrysalis&#039;s disguise fell away. Trixie was seated in the general vicinity of the kitchenette, pans going about their business encased in her magic while she leafed through a magazine. Her hat and cloak were hung up on pegs near the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sunset,&quot; she greeted warmly as she marked her place. &quot;What can we do for you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I asked Twilight to tell me the next time we were both awake. I was hoping we could talk.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mm, do you want some privacy?&quot; The Changeling Queen asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I think that, um, you could help too,&quot; Sunset told them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright then,&quot; Chrysalis situated herself next to the table and indicated the other seat with a hoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was wondering,&quot; she began slowly. &quot;When... When did you know you were... You know...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In love?&quot; Chrysalis batted her eyelashes. &quot;Have you found a special somepony? I suppose I should be flattered that you came to us instead of Cadence, but she really isn&#039;t as pushy as you might have heard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?! No!&quot; Sunset stammered. &quot;I mean, I&#039;m sure you know a lot, and I&#039;d definitely come to you if I <i>did</i>, but...&quot; She took a deep breath and tamped down on her rambling. The topic at hoof had her all out of sorts. &quot;When did you know you were reformed?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah,&quot; Trixie said, nodding in understanding. &quot;This is going to be one of <i>those</i> conversations. I&#039;ll put on the coffee.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought tea was traditional?&quot; Sunset blinked in confusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe for you and Twilight,&quot; the unicorn answered, idly adding a coffee pot to the implements she was magically juggling. &quot;I tend to end up as Luna&#039;s student, and she&#039;s always preferred the bean to the leaf. She likes her coffee like she likes her skies: Dark, with a splash of milky way. She&#039;s also the diarch of choice when it comes to this sort of thing. She knows where we&#039;re coming from.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see...&quot; Sunset said uncertainly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, this has to come from somewhere. What&#039;s got you down?&quot; Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, a couple Loops ago my side of the mirror had a magical girl variant.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Nothing too unusual. Monster of the week, life lessons, big finale, that whole thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you were cast as the villain?&quot; The changeling asked. Oak knew she&#039;d been through that often enough herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Star, actually,&quot; Sunset answered and chewed at her lip for a moment. &quot;I was kicking monster ass, cheered on by the student body, and I realized that I hadn&#039;t really <i>changed</i>, you know? When I ran through that mirror I was looking for power and adoration, and now I have to wonder if I&#039;m only happy because I <i>have</i> them. What if I&#039;m still the same pony that spent years tormenting children and topped it off with mind control?&quot;</p><p class="double">The other two exchanged a glance, and Trixie smiled encouragement to her marefriend.</p><p class="double">&quot;I went through something similar for a long time,&quot; Chrysalis admitted. &quot;Thought I was just a happily glutted parasite feeding on Trixie&#039;s love. I didn&#039;t trust that I was good enough to be otherwise until I got this,&quot; she manifested Kindness around her neck.</p><p class="double">&quot;Which makes her very silly,&quot; Trixie noted, tapping her playfully on the snout before distributing cups of coffee. &quot;Take it from the mare who ascended via extensive property damage: You don&#039;t need the approval of magical jewelry to be a good pony. It would have saved <i>some</i>pony a lot of trouble if they&#039;d taken that advice from the start.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Chrysalis rolled her eyes. &quot;How foolish of me to doubt the Wise and Beautiful Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And humble, don&#039;t forget humble,&quot; the magician smirked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... I&#039;m not sure I want to deal with Harmony over this,&quot; Sunset admitted. Her baseline had been so very long ago, but being on the wrong end of the elements was something that stuck with you. Because, when they really got going, you <i>knew</i> you were in the wrong the moment they struck, deep in your bones with all illusions peeled away.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I said you shouldn&#039;t have to,&quot; Trixie said primly. &quot;Our stories aren&#039;t so different. We wanted fame and power, got them in spades, and were a little conflicted over whether we deserved it. So I&#039;ll give you the same advice Luna and Twilight and just about everypony gave me: The fact that you&#039;re worried about it and <i>want</i> to be good means you probably are.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t take this the wrong way, but is that <i>it?</i> I was hoping for something a little more...&quot; She trailed off, realizing she didn&#039;t know <i>what</i> she&#039;d been hoping for. If she knew what advice she wanted, she wouldn&#039;t have needed to find it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight would probably say it fancier. And longer. And cite sources,&quot; Trixie shrugged. &quot;But this sort of thing is usually only as complicated as you make it, and there&#039;s almost never some magical piece of advice that&#039;ll make you feel better.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... Yeah, okay, that makes sense,&quot; Sunset slumped.</p><p class="double">&quot;But talking helps,&quot; Chrysalis added.</p><p class="double">&quot;And we&#039;ve got the whole Loop ahead of us. Wanna stick around?&quot; Trixie was suddenly beside her, forehoof hooked over one shoulder while the other gestured expansively. &quot;I&#039;m thinking we do a fire and ice theme. Our colors fit perfectly and I&#039;ve been meaning to brush up on cryomancy. What do you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you sure I won&#039;t be in your way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just because we&#039;re dating doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t have time for our friends,&quot; the changeling scolded.</p><p class="double">&quot;And that goes for <i>any</i> Loop. If you need us, we&#039;ll be there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s... Thank you. That sounds good.&quot; She shifted awkwardly. &quot;But, um, can you help me brush up on <i>illusory</i> fire? I kinda specialize in the fighty kind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Sunny,&quot; Trixie grinned wide. &quot;You&#039;ve come to the right mare.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>118.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, girls,” Twilight said, nodding. “I think I understand. I&#039;m surprised it hasn&#039;t happened sooner, actually.”</p><p class="double">Nyx shrugged. “Being a referee is kind of neat, but I want to give it a go myself.”</p><p class="double">“And none o&#039; us wanted to be the ref instead,” Applebloom added. “So, we thought we&#039;d ask you.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m honoured,” Twilight said. “Now – I think I&#039;ve got a potential extra rule, this time. A fillip, as it were.”</p><p class="double">“Go on,” Scootaloo said.</p><p class="double">“Well. You always pick the best of everything. So, this time, a new rule. You can only pick ships which were at one time or another seriously considered – and you won&#039;t know who&#039;s going to drive it.” Twilight held up an envelope. “This has the list of whose ship is going to be commanded by who, and none of you are going to get to see it – so you know that it&#039;s going to be better for you if you pick a really, really <i>bad</i> design.”</p><p class="double">The CMC exchanged glances.</p><p class="double">“Okay, ah&#039;ve already got like four ideas fer that,” Applebloom agreed. “Nice idea.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks.” Twilight shrugged. “Obviously I&#039;ll be perfectly willing to be the referee for a more normal game or two in the future, but I thought this might be a nice break from your routine.”</p><p class="double">“Right.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo rubbed her hooves together. “Okay, get out the consoles. I&#039;ve got a real stinker of a design for you guys!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">About a week later, the two earth ponies, one unicorn, one pegasus, two alicorns and one bizarre mutant squirrel-changeling-lion-starbeast-whatever collage reconvened to start their game.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Twilight began. “Let&#039;s see what you&#039;ve got. Applebloom?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom pointed behind her at the truly insanely large battleship. “HMS <i>Incomparable</i>, reporting. Twenty inch guns, forty-six thousand tonnes, thirty-five knots, armour like tissue paper. Sure, she packs a punch, but actually too much of a punch – you&#039;re going to want ear defenders, it&#039;ll rain sheared rivets all over the ship when she fires, and I don&#039;t hold out much hope the aiming gear will survive the shock.”</p><p class="double">The others gaped.</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s certainly the biggest one here,” Twilight managed. “Okay, next up – Scootaloo.”</p><p class="double">“KMS <i>Graf Zeppelin</i>, with original airgroup.” Scootaloo nodded. “Most of the aircraft she carries are terrible, no torpedo planes, the fighters&#039; undercarriage tends to fall apart on landing and the dive bombers aren&#039;t much better.”</p><p class="double">“Are those <i>casemate guns?</i>” Twilight asked. “On a <i>carrier</i>?”</p><p class="double">“Yep, original design.” Scootaloo shook her head. “And this was the same time they were buildin&#039; Shokakus and Essexes in other parts of the world, too...”</p><p class="double">She pointed. “As a final touch, all the AA guns are on the same side. Just because. And yeah, that&#039;s original too.”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “Are you sure this was a real design?”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo slapped down a sheaf of papers in front of her. “Got built, too.”</p><p class="double">“...huh. Okay...” Twilight sighed. “I feel so depressed... Sweetie?”</p><p class="double">“HMS <i>M2</i>.” Sweetie beamed. “A submersible aircraft carrier with one unarmed seaplane!”</p><p class="double">“...moving on,” Twilight decided. “Tiara?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I feel somehow cheated,” Tiara told her, huffing. “Mine was a production design they made hundreds of.”</p><p class="double">“A Wickes-class destroyer,” Twilight read off the cover sheet. “Where is it?”</p><p class="double">“Behind Applebloom&#039;s mobile mountain, I think.” Tiara sighed. “Well, at least it&#039;ll be quick.”</p><p class="double">Next up was Nyx, who revealed she had built an Ise-class battlecarrier.</p><p class="double">“So, it removed about a third of the heavy guns of a perfectly serviceable – if slow – battleship,” Nyx explained. “And in return, it got the ability to...?”</p><p class="double">She tailed off.</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Tiara looked the ship over. “Launch planes, I guess?”</p><p class="double">“Correct.” Nyx paused. “<i>Float</i>planes.”</p><p class="double">“...then what was the <i>point?</i>” Scootaloo burst out.</p><p class="double">“Exactly,” Nyx agreed. “I fully expect a disastrous aviation fuel fire.”</p><p class="double">Twilight coughed. “I see. And Silver?”</p><p class="double">“The Tessakonteres.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo facehoofed. “Oh, no...”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, what?” Tiara asked. “What&#039;s one of-”</p><p class="double">“It means forty-handed,” Scootaloo explained. “Basically, she built a Greek battleship from back before Rome, which could probably be outmanoeuvred by an island.”</p><p class="double">“...right,” Twilight said. “Well, I must admit I never said it had to be a ship from <i>after</i> the invention of gunpowder... okay, here&#039;s the matchups.”</p><p class="double">She passed them around.</p><p class="double">“What one am I getting?” Sweetie asked. “Hope it&#039;s-”</p><p class="double">She broke off, staring at the paper.</p><p class="double">Sweetie → Sweetie</p><p class="double">“Uh... Twilight?” she asked. “Am I supposed to get mine?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I&#039;ve got mine too,” Nyx reported.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Exactly. You all do.”</p><p class="double">“What!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s-”</p><p class="double">“No fair!”</p><p class="double">“Wait, wait!” Silver said, hovering slightly. “It works! See, now we all have to use rubbish ships we picked ourselves.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom turned an eye on Twilight. “Is this one of them friendship lessons?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Twilight looked slightly embarrassed. “Sort of the opposite, really. &#039;You don&#039;t go to war with the army you want to have.&#039;”</p><p class="double">“Ah. Gotcha.” Applebloom sighed. “Well, best go tryin&#039; to square this circle and turn th&#039; ship into an actually useful war machine...”</p><p class="double">“You think you&#039;ve got problems?” Silver asked. “Mine&#039;s made of wood!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Come on, come on...”</p><p class="double">There was a splintering crash.</p><p class="double">“Aaaargh!” Scootaloo cantered out onto deck and kicked the Ju87R which had just suffered a landing gear failure. “This is stupid!”</p><p class="double">After a session of cursing, she shoved the lost aircraft over the side and replaced it with a Bf109. This one, at least, launched successfully and climbed into the sky.</p><p class="double">“Oh, this is giving me a headache...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon lay back on her blanket, on the top deck of her multi-oared wooden ship.</p><p class="double">The way she saw it, she had no hope whatsoever if she was spotted, so she had better just try not to do anything and hope that that worked out.</p><p class="double">And it meant she could get in some sunbathing on top of that.</p><p class="double">The whole ship shook with a loud <i>clunk-craaash</i>.</p><p class="double">“What?” Silver asked, getting up and looking around. Nothing in sight...</p><p class="double">The Tessakonteres shook, and started to settle slightly in the water.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hello, Sweetie,” Twilight greeted. “What happened?”</p><p class="double">“Surfaced under Silver&#039;s ship,” Sweetie grumbled. “It knocked the hangar doors open, and I flooded.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded sympathetically, and looked over the side of her cloud. “Hmmm... Silver&#039;s ship seems fine.”</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s made of wood, isn&#039;t it?” Sweetie replied. “Wood floats.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver concluded that her ship wasn&#039;t actually going to sink any more, now the hatch to the lowest deck was closed, and slumped.</p><p class="double">Then brightened. It looked like she&#039;d achieved a sinking, which was several times better than she was expecting her Tessakonteres to accomplish.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Who knew...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve got a huge advantage here, Nyx!” Applebloom shouted into the communication relay over the thunder of her guns.</p><p class="double">“Really?” Nyx replied. “How so?”</p><p class="double">A rivet bounced off Applebloom&#039;s head.</p><p class="double">“First, that!” Applebloom gestured, as her ship gradually shredded itself. “My main guns are trying to blow themselves off the ship!”</p><p class="double">Nyx stuck her tongue out. “You chose it!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, to be a failure!” Applebloom winced at a loud groaning sound. “Anyway, gotta be quick before somethin&#039; really does fall off. Yours has got air-observed shot!”</p><p class="double">BLAM.</p><p class="double">“I can&#039;t use my superior range, for-”</p><p class="double">There was a loud <i>bong</i>, and the whole ship rang like a bell.</p><p class="double">Then it shook, and gave a groaning creak.</p><p class="double">“I hate Jackie Fisher...” Applebloom sighed. “There goes the backbone, &#039;cause he didn&#039;t include enough armour to work structurally...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">By the time the smoke cleared and Nyx had taken stock, she felt cautiously optimistic. The three 20” hits she had taken had hurt – one had destroyed the fore turret, and another had caused waterline flooding – but the ship could still fight.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, as there was a suspicious aircraft buzzing around as she landed her floatplanes and hoisted them up for replenishment.</p><p class="double">“Is that you, Scoots?” she asked.</p><p class="double">“Well, it sure as sugar isn&#039;t Sweetie Belle,” Scootaloo replied. “Hey, that looks kind of beat up. Want an aviation fuel fire?”</p><p class="double">“Not especially, no.” Nyx worked her ship up as fast as it could manage – 19 knots – and started up her AA guns. “Right, you came from the east... let&#039;s go visit.”</p><p class="double">“Never fear!” Scootaloo replied. “I&#039;m faster than you, you know!”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Nyx beamed. “But the wind&#039;s coming from my direction. You can&#039;t run and launch planes at the same time.”</p><p class="double">“...you&#039;re quite good at this,” Scootaloo admitted. “Must have been all the stints as ref.”</p><p class="double">At that point, the fire on <i>Incomparable</i> reached her magazine.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hm, not bad,” Trixie said critically. “Bit too much flying metal, couldn&#039;t use it in a show without shields – but the water works with it quite well.”</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “How did you even-”</p><p class="double">Trixie smiled. “There was an explosion due. I have my ways, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Twilight considered that. “I... see...”</p><p class="double">When Trixie wasn&#039;t looking, she wrote a quick note to Spike and sent it off. Then consoled Applebloom on her loss.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“At last!” Tiara cackled. “An easy target!”</p><p class="double">Silver waved. “Hi, Diamond. I guess I&#039;m for it?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much,” Tiara agreed. “Sorry, but I have to take what I can get – if I faced Applebloom&#039;s monster I&#039;d have a life expectancy of about a tenth of a second, even if the recoil did make her roll upside down.”</p><p class="double">“If I had marines, I&#039;d be boarding you right now,” Silver commented absently.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, probably.” Diamond shrugged, and opened fire. Specifically, she set Silver&#039;s hull on fire.</p><p class="double">“Abandon ship!” Silver called. She tapped a hoof on the floor, and the instruments of a complete orchestra appeared, playing <i>my heart will go on.</i> “See? A band, on ship!”</p><p class="double">Tiara groaned. “Do Draconequui have a biological need for puns?”</p><p class="double">“All signs point to yes, I&#039;m afraid.” Silver shrugged. “Bye – this could take a while.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Run away, run away, run away,” Scootaloo chanted. “Running, running, running...”</p><p class="double">The AA guns started firing. As did the broadside guns.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hi Tiara,” she added. “Sorry, this carrier&#039;s kind of not vulnerable to that.”</p><p class="double">The gallant little destroyer met a broadside of eight 6” rounds coming the other way, and promptly exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That sucked,” Tiara said, shaking her head. “Ow.”</p><p class="double">She shook Silver&#039;s paw. “Thanks for the grace you took your defeat with, by the way. I forgot to mention.”</p><p class="double">“It helps keep it all friendly, I think,” Twilight supplied.</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s head went up, and she vanished.</p><p class="double">“What just-” Applebloom began.</p><p class="double">Twilight cast a time spell. “To the minute. Well, that&#039;s vaguely worrying...”</p><p class="double">“What?” the fillies pressed.</p><p class="double">“Spike <i>just</i> set off a large pile of explosives about ten miles outside Appleloosa. Trixie said she had an explosion sense, and I thought I&#039;d check that... I&#039;m still surprised the answer was yes...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The fourteen dive bombers, all that was left of Scootaloo&#039;s air wing aside from two remaining fighters, straggled down to the deck.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo kept one eye on the plotting board. She&#039;d have to recover them quickly to avoid trouble from that battleship...</p><p class="double">Land. Land. Crunch. Land. Crunch...</p><p class="double">Every time an overstressed landing gear gave way, or an arrestor hook tore out of the aircraft, was like a tiny cut to her chances of winning. Nyx might be down to her secondary armament by now, but that was still more than enough to finish her off in a surface action-</p><p class="double">The <i>fifteenth</i> plane in the landing formation dropped something.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo had just enough time to notice it before it went through the deck with a <i>crunch</i>, through the armour belt with a <i>clang</i>, initiated, and detonated in the hangar.</p><p class="double">“Oh... horsefeathers,” she said softly, as her carrier promptly caught fire.</p><p class="double">“Nyx! What did you <i>do?</i>”</p><p class="double">“I spent about half an hour before your last attack rigging a seaplane with one of the main gun shells, that&#039;s what!” Nyx said, sounding very pleased with herself. “Gotcha!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah...” Scootaloo sighed. “I feel so embarrassed. Sunk by an airstrike from a battleship...”</p><p class="double">“I couldn&#039;t have done it without you,” Nyx told her with a wink.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s never do that again,” Applebloom said, once they were all gathered together again.</p><p class="double">“Agreed,” Sweetie said fervently. “We all hated our ships, I&#039;m pretty sure.”</p><p class="double">“Did you learn anything from it?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Diamond looked between the other fillies, who nodded, then turned to the Anchor. “Get Spike to be the ref.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">118.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer lay back on the grass, just a few furlongs from Fluttershy&#039;s house.</p><p class="double">She made a gesture with her hoof, and twenty-four glowing keys shimmered into being over her head. She frowned, shifting them back and forth, then made a decision and tapped one.</p><p class="double"><i>Heart of Joke</i> dropped into her hoof as the others vanished like smoke, sticking to it like they were magnetized. She waved it back and forth, feeling the balance, and smiled.</p><p class="double">“Afternoon!”</p><p class="double">Sunset craned her neck to see who was coming up the hill towards her. “Oh – good afternoon, Lyra.”</p><p class="double">“So,” the green unicorn added. “What&#039;s with the display?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Sunset reached another hoof to the sky, and her characteristic <i>Shimmering Sunset</i> formed. “Well, I usually use this one, but I was thinking – what&#039;s the point of a Keyblade you never use? So I was trying to pick one to get used to, to use next time.”</p><p class="double">“Right, right. Cool.” Lyra watched as Sunset stowed <i>Shimmering Sunset</i>, and then selected <i>Super Galaxy Bonds.</i> “What&#039;s that one for?”</p><p class="double">“Kisaragi Gentarou,” Sunset answered without missing a beat. “A who, not a what. Most of them are. He&#039;s one of the guys who anchors the world all the Kamen Riders live.”</p><p class="double">“More humans?”</p><p class="double">Something in Lyra&#039;s tone made Sunset pause weighing the keyblades against one another. She looked over at Lyra, and frowned slightly. “I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re the human one?”</p><p class="double">“Yep.” Lyra nodded, and knelt down before rolling over onto her back. It was awkward, but she adopted a fair facsimile of a human lounging back on a hillside with one hand on their knee. “Got it in one.”</p><p class="double">“To be fair, there&#039;s only four choices.” Sunset dismissed them both. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Lyra “Heartstrings” Heartson shook her head. “Just... kind of jealous, I guess?”</p><p class="double">“Jealous of what?” Sunset asked softly.</p><p class="double">“Your first few loops after you awoke... you were a human. You were a human for a lot of them.” Lyra raised an eyebrow, and Sunset nodded confirmation. “And then you came back here, and now you&#039;re usually a pony.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s correct.”</p><p class="double">“But me... well, every single loop, I get loads of memories from me-as-a-human. Every last time. But just about all the time, I&#039;m living in a world of magical ponies. Who are quadrupeds.”</p><p class="double">The human-in-mind-only tapped a hoof on the floor. “So... all this, all this being-four-legged, I never get the chance to get used to it. I get the memories from when Lyra-all-of-us is human, so every five years of experience being a pony gets swamped by hundreds of years of memories-being-a-human. So... so I tend to let the others drive, I guess...”</p><p class="double">Sunset nodded sympathetically. “Yeah, I got that a lot, from the other direction. Still do from this one, a little.”</p><p class="double">“Really?” Lyra looked dubious. “How?”</p><p class="double">“See this?” Sunset materialized <i>Will of Fire.</i> “I got this in Naruto&#039;s world – the Elemental Nations. The specific experiences which got me the keychain were a few weeks long, and my memory of them is nearly photographic.”</p><p class="double">She smiled fondly. “That&#039;s what a keychain <i>is</i>. It&#039;s... memories, simple as that, just wrapped in magic and friendship and a shiny shape. And it means I never forget a single one, nor what earned them.”</p><p class="double"><i>Will of Fire</i> vanished, replaced by <i>Shimmering Sunset.</i></p><p class="double">“This is the one I got because of my time in Equestria, my very first loop – before I, or, er, technically you... awakened. Me, I mean.”</p><p class="double">Pushing past that embarrassing point, Sunset went on. “And it&#039;s valid for nearly half the loop. A long one, at that. So, basically, I had perfect recall of several years as a pony all through my time in other worlds... and now, I&#039;ve got perfect recall of several years of human life as a pony.”</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Lyra nodded. “I didn&#039;t know that.”</p><p class="double">Sunset smiled.</p><p class="double">Then there was a flicker of light.</p><p class="double">They both looked at the small charm sitting between them, and the golden chain connected to it.</p><p class="double">“Is that—”</p><p class="double">“I think it is,” Sunset confirmed.</p><p class="double">Lyra gaped for a moment before asking, &quot;But <i>why</i> is it—&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset lifted the string of seven pearls in her magic. &quot;I don&#039;t know, and I&#039;m kind of afraid to find out. Is Derpy even Awake this Loop?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">118.3 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack ducked under a low-hanging branch, panting lightly as she struggled to compress her magic as tightly within herself as she could.</p><p class="double">&#039;<i>This was such ah good Loop too.</i>&#039; She thought, ruefully, as the old barn at the edge of the orchard came into view. It had been a Stealth Anchor Baseline Run. Only her, Cheerilee, and Gilda were Awake, and so she had spent most of her free time getting their advice on the set-up of a couple of the wings of her museum. Whoever the Anchor was, they hadn&#039;t revealed themselves or pinged. Baseline had proceeded as per normal; right up until Tirek broke out early. Applejack still wasn&#039;t sure what had happened, as Tirek had shown up stronger than she had seen him in a long time, and he had cast some spell that caused Twilight&#039;s Library, with Twilight and all three of the Baseline Alicorn Princesses inside, to vanish into thin air. Applejack could still sense the Princesses&#039; power, but it felt faint and far off. Possibly in a different dimension.</p><p class="double">In any case, Tirek had drained Discord, Cheerilee, and Gilda of power, gaining Gilda&#039;s ink abilities in the process, and reminding all three of the Loopers why he really was a threat. Applejack had managed to escape with only minor draining, and now she was suppressing her magic as much as possible to keep Tirek from tracking her through that.</p><p class="double">Applejack slipped into the barn and shook herself, dislodging leaves and some dirt from when she had Earthbent her way out of town. On the edge of her senses, she felt Tirek approaching, though he didn&#039;t appear to be moving straight towards her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ok. Now, let&#039;s see if this works.&quot; Applejack had been running back to the barn to pack up the wing of the museum that she had been tinkering with, when she had remembered an item she had picked up a couple dozen Loops ago. She dashed into the hall, flaring a bit of magic to break the seal she had put on the door to keep the CMC from poking around. In the distance, she felt Tirek&#039;s anger sharpen and he began to approach faster, moving towards her position.</p><p class="double">Moving quickly, she pulled several of the more fragile items that were on display into her Pocket, then withdrew a single golden tablet. She placed it against the back wall, pushing a bit of her magic into it, just as the doors, and most of the walls around them, were ripped off, revealing Tirek in his dark majesty.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hahahaha, I&#039;ve found you, pony! You are the last. With you, my conquest of magic will be complete. Now, prepare to lose your magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack spun to face him, and then grinned. &quot;Alright. If y&#039;all want mah magic so badly, I&#039;ll give it to y&#039;all. But I&#039;ll do it mah way.&quot; And then she bucked the Tablet of Ahkmenrah (or, as Dash has said is should be called, Jackmenrah). She flooded her magic into the tablet, and a wave of golden light flowed outward. Tirek brought his arms up, grasping at the wave of light, only for it to flow around him and across the building. He blinked, as Applejack began to laugh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah got two things to tell y&#039;all. One, it&#039;s nighttime right now, and will be till we get Celestia back, and two, this is a museum!&quot;</p><p class="double">Tirek scowled in confusion, before he noticed motion out of the corner of his eye. All around him, close to two dozen statues were coming to life, wings stretching, as the Hall of Ascension came alive.</p><p class="double">Tirek scoffed. &quot;You think to best me with statuary. You&#039;ve squandered your magic. I shall &quot;*FOOMPH* Whatever Tirek had been planning to accomplish was lost as the statue of Trixie the magnificent decided to lead off with a blast of fireworks spells.</p><p class="double">At the moment, Applejack could tell that she was still more powerful than Tirek, though it was a lot closer than she was comfortable with. In the face of that, it seemed somewhat odd that she would split her power with the Tablet and the items in her museum. However, she didn&#039;t want Tirek to have the chance to drain her abilities like he had Gilda and Cheerilee, and, while her magic was used as a catalyst for the tablet, it utilized an even greater power.</p><p class="double">Applejack wasn&#039;t much of a scholar compared to Twilight, or even Trixie, and she hadn&#039;t had that long to study the golden tablet, but she had found that it was actually quite similar to the Elements of Harmony. The Elements, in the most basic terms, tapped into the universal energy of Harmony, and not only used it to amplify the powers of the wielder, but also channeled the energy directly. It was this connection to a greater power that allowed six above-average ponies to defeat godlike foes many magnitudes of power above their level in baseline. It was also what allowed them to use the Elements outside of the Equestria Loops, because the concept and energy of Harmony existed across universes.</p><p class="double">Similarly, the Tablet of Ahkmenrah called on the power of History. The greater the presence of a given figure in history, the greater the power granted to images of the figure by the Tablet. There were more functions, but most of those were layered over the basic functionality of, quite literally, bringing History to life.</p><p class="double">For ordinary museum pieces, such as the figure of Sacajawea that Applejack had replaced when she got the tablet, the figure represented perhaps a handful of centuries impact in history, maybe as much as a millennia or two on the outside, giving them many of the skills and abilities the figure represented had in life, but not too much power overall. The figures in Applejack&#039;s museum, and more specifically, in the Ascension Wing that she was currently facing off against Tirek within, represented beings that had had eons of history behind them, that had altered the course and fate of thousands of universes. And now, all of the weight and power of that History was being fully brought to bear against the dark tyrant, Tirek.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cutie Mark Crusaders, Alicorn Attack Go!&quot;</p><p class="double">The living statues of the CMC led off the charge. Scootaloo and Diamond Tiara approached first, Scoots going low and Tiara aiming high. Scootaloo bent the air around her into a sharp blade, grinding the air against itself, and smashed into Tirek&#039;s knees, causing them to buckle, slightly. At the same time, Diamond Tiara built up a telekinetic wall in front of her and rammed it into Tirek&#039;s face, synchronizing it with a bolt of telepathic force against his mind. She didn&#039;t try to establish a connection, wanting no part of Tirek in her head.</p><p class="double">Tirek staggered backwards, a bit dazed, as Nyx and Sweetie Bell followed up on the assault, Nyx with a blast of explosive void magic and Sweetie with a pure note of force, both of which smashed through Tirek&#039;s magic draining ability and knocked him spinning into a swamp of fondue and tree sap created by Silver Spoon and the statue of Discord from the Pre-Ascended Section. Tirek struggled, just as Applebloom brought the device she had been constructing with her mane around. It was fairly small, a single polished shaft, which let out a humming buzz as it fired out a thin beam of blue light. Sparks of azure lightning crackled across Tirek as it impacted with no other visible effect. Tirek started to chuckle, before Applebloom&#039;s next words cut him off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mordekainen&#039;s Disjunction Laser Mk 4.6. He shouldn&#039;t be able to drain magic for the next few minutes. Hit him hard!&quot;</p><p class="double">And then the pain started.</p><p class="double">Applejack stood back next to the statues of the Mane Six, who had all held back at the statue of Twilight&#039;s insistence.</p><p class="double">The blonde farmer tilted her head slightly. &quot;So, just to get it out of tha way, but are you Awake?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned, before shaking her head slowly. &quot;No. I am aware of the significance of the term, but I am not truly Awake. It is more like... I am like someone that has read an in-depth biography of the Looping being known as Twilight Sparkle. I know all of the history behind her that you recorded, along with a few other things that bled over from somewhere else. Contingency plans she has made and such. But I am also aware that you built me and that I am truly only a replica of the true Twilight Sparkle, a rather pale copy at that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. While the Alicorn (and Changeling Queen, and Dragonequues, and Griffon-bear?, etc.) Statues were holding out rather well against Tirek, Applejack could feel the fact that it wasn&#039;t doing much too actually weaken him. His power levels were lowering, but the statues were still in the end just copies, as was shown when one of Tirek&#039;s Ink Slashes tore through Gilda&#039;s and smashed against a hastily erected barrier by Shining Armor, shattering it as well. Applejack turned back to the group. &quot;We need something stronger. The Elements.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity turned from admiring the one-eight scale size Spikezilla firing a jet of flame into Tirek&#039;s rather abused face (it being a favored target of both Celestia and Luna), and shook her head. &quot;It won&#039;t work. We don&#039;t have access to our Pockets. I tried to pull out a battle dress that I, me, the other me made, and there was nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;And we can&#039;t call them either. I tried and there was no response.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack frowned. &quot;Huh, interestin&#039;. I have a few in mah pocket, but they&#039;re attuned to me, so I don&#039;t think you could really use them all that well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded again. &quot;Or at all. We are still just statuary, they might not react...&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash cut in. &quot;Yeah, yeah. Science time later, solution time now. I could fly to the Tree and...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut her off. &quot;No, the gems might not even exist anymore, assuming the box was opened by this Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash huffed. &quot;Well, what do you suggest then?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paused, and then smiled. &quot;Give me a minute. I have an idea.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">All things told, the battle was going pretty well. Tirek had gotten his second wind, but it wasn&#039;t meaning much when faced with the combined experience of the Loopers&#039; Statues. Zecora, one of her wings broken off, stomped on the ground, and a thick wooden vine lashed out to bind Tirek&#039;s legs in place, just in time for Shining Armor and Cadance to blast him with a Love-based burst of force.</p><p class="double">Lyra Heartstrings darted around, dodging past one of the large inky bombs Tirek had started lobbing about. Princess Luna had been taken out by a single blast from one of them, and the rest of the Statues were being careful to avoid them. Lyra was feeling rather frustrated at the moment, because she was likely the weakest fighter in the entire battle. Most of her abilities were tied up in her split memories, and while she knew about having split memories, she, as a statue, didn&#039;t possess either the disparate personalities, or the ability to manifest their abilities. Still, she would use what she could. Focusing intently, her horn glowed as she fired off a globe of force, knocking Tirek&#039;s hoof out from under him. His guard dropped, and a haymaker from Spikezilla knocked him off his feet, straight into a quintuple buck, courtesy of the CMC sans Silver Spoon, who was currently trying to put Discord and Luna back together.</p><p class="double">Lyra grinned as Tirek crashed to the ground. If she made it through this fight, she intended to tell Applejack to make statues of her other selves, as right now she was limited to her Unicorn body. She couldn&#039;t even properly use her thief skills.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look out!&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra gasped as she was jerked backwards, moments before a large beam from the broken roof above crashed down where she had been crouched. Lyra shuddered, then turned towards Vinyl Scratch, who&#039;d pulled her out of danger.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t mention it!&quot; Vinyl belted out. Lyra winced, and Vinyl coughed quickly. &quot;Sorry, been amplifying every sound I make to try and make a difference. Forgot to turn off the reverb.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra shook her head. &quot;Not a problem. Let&#039;s see where we can go help.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vinyl nodded, and both of them returned to the fight, just in time to see Ivory Scroll dash in and slap a Restraining Order onto Tirek&#039;s face, locking him in place.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Got it.&quot; The Mane Six Plus One turned to look at Twilight, just as her eyes opened and light flared out, feebly but still visible. A rainbow aura gathered around her body, and Twilight smirked at the looks of comprehension on the others&#039; faces. &quot;Each of us has been a bearer of pure Harmony at least once. I knew what it felt like, and I was able to trace it back. We can call on that power and uuuuu~ss&quot; she swayed suddenly, staggering before catching herself. &quot;Ooogh, that&#039;s not good. The powers of the tablet and Harmony aren’t meshing well. The magic of Harmony is trying to take over supporting me, and it&#039;s pushing the power of the tablet out. I can balance it, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded. &quot;How long can you hold it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Long enough for one good shot, at least.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie bounced up, laying one of her wings over Twilight&#039;s. Rapidly, her skin and wings began glowing with rainbow energy as well. &quot;Make that six good shots. Heehee, we&#039;re like a revolver of Harmony.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled as the others approached, using her aura as a catalyst for their own transformation. &quot;The backlash will probably break our statue forms, so after this it will be up to you.&quot; She glanced at Applejack.</p><p class="double">Applejack nodded solemnly, the light of Harmony building around her as well, and then the seven of them took off.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was the first to reach Tirek, who had been pushed back out of the broken museum and into the orchard proper. She circled, squeezed between Princess Big Mac and Sunset&#039;s Crown Demon form from the Accidental Ascension exhibit, and gathered as much speed as she could. It was just shy of a Sonic Rainboom, but the detonation of Harmony still created a large shockwave, knocking Tirek through several rows of trees.</p><p class="double">Rarity was the next to strike, flying down from above, helped by a Fastball Special from Spikezilla, who had taken to the sky. One crater later and Tirek was just pulling himself to his feet, when Pinkie and Fluttershy came at him from either side, resulting in a double detonation.</p><p class="double">Applejack grinned as she saw raw magic peeling away. The magic Tirek had stolen was breaking free, a sure sign he was weakening. Twilight was just coming around for her attack run, when suddenly she tumbled in mid-air and vanished in a flash of light. Applejack and her counterpart pulled up short, wary of whatever attack Tirek had just pulled out of his pocket, when Applejack felt a slight pressure. Acting on a hunch, she tapped the ground, pulsing out her senses through the earth, towards Ponyville.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s library was back. Maybe this Loop&#039;s Twilight suddenly reappearing disrupted her statue&#039;s balance with Harmony? It didn&#039;t matter, so Applejack shook it off and nodded towards her duplicate. As Dash had said, science time later, solution time now.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s do this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm!&quot;</p><p class="double">The twin farmponies charged, building up speed with Earthbending as they charged at Tirek, who was still blinking from the Twilight Statue&#039;s flashy exit. He realized they were approaching a moment too late, and both of them rushed into his guard, each executing a perfect turn, and bucked him square in the sternum. Applejack felt the energy rushing out of her statue, and focused on amplifying it with her own power. She could feel Tirek&#039;s ability, which had come back moments after Dash impacted him, pulling at the magic, but the pull was feeble, and most of the power went straight into causing Tirek pain.</p><p class="double">There was a double crack, the first being the sound of Tirek blasting through what was left of the canopy and into the sky, and the second being the sound of the broken form of Applejack&#039;s statue hitting the ground. Applejack winced, her statue was in several pieces, but it should be repairable. Quickly, she scooped all of the pieces into her Pocket, and quickly rose after Tirek.</p><p class="double">It was almost anti-climactic. She had just cleared the tree-line when two Twilights and the three Princesses all popped in at once, directly in Tirek&#039;s parabolic flight path. One of the Twilights, which Applejack immediately pegged as the real Twilight, lashed out with a beam of Harmonic Magic, which blasted the already leaking magic straight out of Tirek. His unconscious body flew back the way it came, and Applejack caught him out of the air, checking to make sure he really was unconscious.</p><p class="double">The statue Twilight flew over. &quot;I sensed them coming back, and I felt Celestia reaching for the sun. I knew I needed to stop her from raising it before we finished with Tirek.&quot; Applejack blinked and nodded. She had been too focused on Tirek to even notice.</p><p class="double">Speaking of Celestia... &quot;So, dear Applejack, this simulacrum of our newest Princess said you could explain her existence?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed. &quot;Yeah, let me pull out the pamphlet.&quot; This was going to take a while to clean up.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">118.4 (Gamer A)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was the start of another loop, and Rarity was busy sewing the decorations for the Summer Sun festival. Oh, sometimes she would just pull a set out of her Pocket and get to work on something more interesting, but right now, she happened to be in the mood for simple busywork.</p><p class="double">She was snapped out of her trance by the sound of the front door, and began to rattle off her usual welcome as she took in the new arrivals: a familiar seeming local shepherd and some of his flock. &quot;Hello, Welcome to Rarity&#039;s boutique – ah, if it isn&#039;t Dolly and Sweaters coming by for a visit again. I must admit, I wasn&#039;t expecting you at this hour, Mr. Bell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, Rarity,&quot; &quot;Sweaters&quot; the pinkish sheep said, a sigh audible in her tone. &quot;Dolly,&quot; with a more purplish tint, was busy squealing over some of the outfits she had on display, while the fourth sheep, whose distinguishing feature was a simple white hat, was standing at the shepherd&#039;s side. The shepherd himself was a navy blue stallion with a black hair and mane, and a cutie-mark of a tower with a bell on top.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, well, I had something I needed to check up on,&quot; &quot;Shepherd&#039;s Bell&quot; responded, producing something for her to look at. &quot;First, I wanted to get your advice on this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Playing along for the moment, Rarity looked at the trinket. &quot;Hmm, I haven&#039;t seen one of these in a while. Wood, carved and colored into the shape of a mistletoe decoration, attached to a nylon string. And if I&#039;m not mistaken... it was mistletoe wood to begin with.&quot; She looked back up at the stallion. &quot;Normally I&#039;d say it was completely the wrong time of year to be showing this off. But you just wanted to see if I recognized it, didn&#039;t you, Abel?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thought of you the minute I Awoke,&quot; he confirmed, &quot;Alright. We can all speak freely now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Finally...&quot; &quot;Sweaters&quot; relaxed, &quot;It&#039;s bad enough being called Sweater girl or Yoohoo. It&#039;s worse being named that way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Yuzu, I remember,&quot; Rarity responded. &quot;Now Abel – I may go on calling you that? - What really brings you here? Your world was a trial, with several tricks Atsuro didn&#039;t properly prepare me for – but I have endured worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Might as well. I was just seeing whether absorbing several demons had any permanent effects on you,&quot; Abel said, smiling off to the side, &quot;That sort of thing can be dangerous in the wrong circumstances, you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just a drop in the bucket, I assure you. It did however give me some of my own Loop powers back for the lockdown&#039;s duration,&quot; Rarity answered, &quot;Enduring our siblings was much worse. I wasn&#039;t expecting Sweetie Belle to be an unrelated rock star.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I didn&#039;t know she was a singer!&quot; Atsuro defended himself, &quot;...But I guess I should&#039;ve remembered. Naoya was my idol on top of everything else, and has some big shoes to fill. If I&#039;d thought for a second, I&#039;d have known he was the same as always.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you deal with everything?&quot; Abel asked, &quot;Atsuro wouldn&#039;t tell me that part.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, first I fought Beldr on schedule. then I convinced Remiel to let me fight Jezebel early - no point leaving that priestess at risk. But after that...I got into a heated argument with the border guards,&quot; Rarity admitted, &quot;Pointing out that they were making that cult look like heroes in comparison drove some of them over the edge. After that... Things escalated quickly. Fortunately after my brief career as an alicorn lightning rod, everyone was more inclined to match wits instead of blades with me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm, Maybe I should try something like that next time.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">118.5 (Jcogginsa)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Shining Armor awoke, he noticed three things immediately.</p><p class="double">The first was the telltale sensation of a shield dropping. That tended to happen when he woke up with a shield out. The second thing he noticed was that he was a biped this loop. Human, probably. The third thing he noticed was a noticeable weight in his chest area.</p><p class="double">&#039;<i>Great. Human and a different gender. Always an annoying combination. Oh well, better check the loop memories. Let&#039;s see....Superhero, power&#039;s force fields of course...Ooh, I&#039;m Canadian, that&#039;ll be fun. Named after the Jedi of the seas, neat...fighting something called Leviathan. Evil Aquaman on steroids, from the sound of it...I use force fields instead of clo-</i>&#039;</p><p class="double">Shining immediately blushed, and began to reapply his &#039;Costume&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Shining Armor watched the battle unfold with distaste. He was a soldier in the baseline, and usually out of it too, so he had much more of a stomach for this that his sister did. That didn&#039;t mean he liked seeing people die.</p><p class="double">&#039;<i>Okay, I&#039;ve had enough. Time to start operation Buck this Shit.</i>&#039;</p><p class="double">Shining reached inside himself, and ascended. This, since he was human, and female, resulted in a magical girl transformation. Of course it did.</p><p class="double">His outfit resembled the traditional sailor fuku, only it was very obviously made of the same energy as the force fields. The wings were real at least. No actual horn though, just the force field horn this person usually had. Not important anyway.</p><p class="double">Afterwards, he reached into his subspace pocket, and pulled out a thing of pure beauty. It was a shield personified, to him at least. It was Captain America&#039;s mighty shield. Shining Armor still wanted to meet the looping version of the man, but Shining felt even the unawake version was worthy of admiration, and always had time to talk to him.</p><p class="double">Grinning, Shining Armor charged the Evil Aquaman Ripoff and shouted &quot;Stars and Stripes!&quot;</p><p class="double">Then he proceeded to smash the Endbringer around before banishing it to the moon. Manually of course. No elements this loop, and he didn&#039;t have one anyway.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">118.6 (fractalman)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the absolutely massive chocolate syrup swimming pool, then headed back into her library-tree-house to reread a random book.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie took one look and decided it needed sprinkles, banana slices, fresh strawberries, and a giant cherry.</p><p class="double">Rarity took a look at the result. &quot;Shouldn&#039;t it have, you know...whipped cream?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not this time!&quot; replied Pinkie.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">118.7 (Gamerex27)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Yu Narukami Awoke lying in bed. Something immediately felt off. For one thing, he felt much smaller than usual. He quickly thought that he might have Awoken earlier in his timeline in this particular variant.</p><p class="double">He was partially correct: he certainly was younger this Loop. However, as he discovered when he tried to get out of bed, that wasn&#039;t the only thing that was different.</p><p class="double">His shoulders refused to move the way he wanted them too. Grunting, he struggled to get up, waving his limbs vainly in an attempt to get his numb fingers to push himself up.</p><p class="double">And, when he got a glimpse of his limbs, he understood why he couldn&#039;t feel his fingers. Because, at the time, he didn&#039;t have any. In place of his hand was a gray-furred hoof.</p><p class="double"><i>Great,</i> the Seeker of Truth thought to himself. <i>This must be Equestria, then</i>.</p><p class="double">He skimmed his Loop memories. Apparently, his name here was True Sight (still not as bad as the Sisterhood Complex Kingpin of Steel), and he was still in grade school; today was the first day. Looking behind him, he saw that he was covered front to back in a dishwasher gray coat. According to his memories, there was supposed to be a symbol on his flank called a &quot;Cutie Mark&quot; (he rolled his eyes at this), but he was too young to have one.</p><p class="double">He sent out a Ping, and got back around a dozen responses. At least he wasn&#039;t alone this Loop (though, since Igor was the Anchor back home, he didn&#039;t have to worry about Lonely Loops like some other Loopers).</p><p class="double">&quot;True! You up in there!&quot; That was unmistakably Dojima&#039;s voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yu said, in a voice that was too high-pitched for his liking. &quot;I just need to grab my books, and I&#039;ll be on my way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Big bro!&quot; said another voice, most definitely Nanako&#039;s. &quot;Come eat breakfast! Your alfalfa browns are getting cold!&quot;</p><p class="double">Yes, this was going to be a <i>strange</i> Loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Yu took his seat in class, he scanned the rest of the classroom. Several of the peo-ponies looked suspiciously familiar. One of them, wearing Naoto&#039;s hat, tipped her cap in their usual signal to tell if they were Awake-and, since she took it off afterwards, all of them were. Yu nodded in turn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, great,&quot; said a voice behind him, &quot;it&#039;s a whole <i>herd</i> of blank flanks. As if the three weren&#039;t enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Considering how his Loop Memories told him that the phrase was a derogatory term, Yu figured that this must be a bully. Turning his head, he saw a pink filly sneering at him, reminding him somewhat of King Moron from her attitude.</p><p class="double">While the best way-in his experiences, at least-to deal with jerks was to ignore them, that didn&#039;t mean it was the only solution.</p><p class="double"><i>Hey, Bro,</i> Yosuke (here called Second Wheel) said, using a private telepathy spell. <i>I&#039;m not looking forwards to spending a whole year with these girls. You want to stop them before they get started?</p><p class="double">Sure, </i>Yu replied. <i>But I think we should let everyone else get a turn, too.</p><p class="double">Damn right, we will,</i> Kanji (or Steel Weaver this time) added. <i>I want to shut these assholes down before they can get to anyone else.</i></p><p class="double">Behind Yu, Yukiko snorted, desperately trying to hold in her laughter. Considering how nearly everything in this Loop was named after a horse pun of some kind, it was amazing that Yukiko was able to keep her cool for this long without breaking down into another laughing fit.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a lot of books on your desk, blank flank,&quot; said another pony condescendingly. She glared at Yukiko, who gave no sign of noticing them.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara bumped hooves with Silver Spoon, and sneered again. &quot;Too bad you won&#039;t be needing them, since you don&#039;t even have a Cutie Mark for reading. Or anything. Your head&#039;s as blank as your own flank.&quot;</p><p class="double">That as the final straw for the black pony: she collapsed into helpless laughter, sliding out of her seat and onto the ground.</p><p class="double">Diamond and Silver instantly stopped laughing at her expense, and turned to stare at the other filly. &quot;What&#039;s... so funny, blankie?&quot; Diamond put on a half-hearted sneer, clearly thrown off of her game when Yukiko reacted in the exact opposite way she expected.</p><p class="double">&quot;P..p...Ponyville....heeee.....Steamy Sanctuary.....ho....blank....FLANK! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot; Yukiko beat her hooves on the ground, her eyes already starting to water up out of sheer mirth.</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s mask of carefully constructed disdain shattered to pieces, replaced by a look of absolute horror. This <i>blank flank</i> was <i>mocking her!</i> &quot;Stop that! Stop laughing at me!&quot;</p><p class="double">Yukiko paid her no heed, and she continued to literally roll around on the floor, laughing.</p><p class="double">&quot;STOP LAUGHING AT ME!&quot; Her plans thoroughly dashed, Diamond Tiara screamed in frustration, and stormed out of the classroom, followed by an equally annoyed Silver Spoon.</p><p class="double">The room was silent, save for the teacher droning on and on about long division (it was amazing, Yu had thought many times over his countless Loops, how little teachers noticed what was going on in their own classrooms) and Yukiko&#039;s laughter. The sound of applause came from nowhere. Yu turned his gaze to see three fillies sitting together, clapping their hooves wildly. The Awake Cutie Mark Crusaders were very impressed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next day, the pair of disgruntled bullies decided to try again, this time with the gray-coated blank flank.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re staring at nothing an awful lot, aren&#039;t you?&quot; Diamond Tiara hissed to Yu. He had been so busy fusing Personas in his mind (a trick he had learned from Igor not too long ago), he hadn&#039;t been paying attention to the lesson.</p><p class="double">&quot;Keep going,&quot; the bully continued, &quot;I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get your Cutie Mark for being a brainless daydreamer soon enough. I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be on your flank annnny second now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Now.</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Yu said slowly, without a trace of emotion of any kind, &quot;you&#039;re staring at my flank, then.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bully froze mid sentence. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m flattered,&quot; he continued, &quot;but I don&#039;t think flirting is allowed in school.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s face turned red, and Silver Spoon subtly scooted her seat away from her friend to avoid her incoming outburst. &quot;H-How dare you! I wasn&#039;t-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Cheerilee,&quot; Yu said, much louder than he usually spoke, &quot;Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon are staring at my plot. It&#039;s making me uncomfortable.&quot;</p><p class="double">Not even turning around, the Unawake teacher continued writing on her chalkboard. &quot;Miss Tiara, Miss Spoon, could you please stay after class? I need to speak with you about your behavior as of late.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bullies stuttered in rage and disdain, before finally falling silent and sulking in their seats.</p><p class="double">They glared at Yu for the rest of the class. He didn&#039;t care at all.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">118.8 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle had a plan for this Loop; to introduce Equestria to a magic-based version of the Internet. It took very little time for her to set up; magic-generated electricity was already part of Equestrian infrastructure in baseline, as were typewriters and even primitive arcade games. Crystal balls took a lot of power to become more than fortune-teller props, but a wall plug and booster stations took care of that problem. Programming was the simplest part, since magic-based transistors could go beyond binary and Boolean logic, beyond fuzzy logic, straight into Pinkie Logic if necessary.</p><p class="double">Thus, only a few months after the start of the Loop, every home and business in Ponyville and Canterlot was equipped with a shiny new magical terminal, and Twilight Sparkle looked forward to making Ponyville her home world&#039;s version of Silicon Valley.</p><p class="double">Twilight woke bright and early the morning of Activation Day, when the network went live for the first time. She trotted downstairs to where she&#039;d had her terminal set up, turned it on, and logged in to her account.</p><p class="double"><i>You have (1) new message</i></p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. Who would have sent the first message? Apple Bloom (Awake) or Pinkie Pie (not, but still indispensable for programming)? Applejack? Probably not Rainbow Dash or Rarity, who likely weren&#039;t up yet, nor Fluttershy, who hated even going to her mailbox. Or maybe Princess Celestia? Surely the Princess would want to send the first message on the new system to all her newly wired subjects!</p><p class="double">Eager to find out, she opened the message and read:</p><p class="double"><i><b>DO YOU SUFFER FROM HORN DYSFUNCTION?</b></i></p><p class="double"><i>Ask your doctor about </i><i><b>VIAGIC!</b></i></p><p class="double"><i>VIAGIC is a little blue pill which can restore horn function on demand, providing longer and stronger magical activity for those with horn dysfunction problems.</i></p><p class="double"><u><i>WARNING: unicorns with heart or lung conditions should not take VIAGIC.

<p>119.1 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>And the Rest Loop: Applebuck Season</b></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle glared at the crowd of animals surrounding Applejack. The farm pony had been trussed tighter than a broken leg at a kingdom-wide Colt Scouts jamboree. A dog-sized mummy of rope stood on a stake beside hers. One of the critters had just finished piling the wood beneath her and had begun fiddling with a box of matches.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, Angel Bunny,&quot; Fluttershy murmured, &quot;I know Applejack was a little bit frightening and scared your friends, but isn&#039;t burning her at the stake just a little bit excessive?&quot;</p><p class="double">The other bunnies raised torches (and a few pitchforks) into the air. Angel Bunny, being him, pulled a flamethrower from his pocket and tested it.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy ducked away from the roaring flame and squeaked, &quot;Of course that&#039;s only my opinion!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think you&#039;d better go home, Fluttershy,&quot; Twilight said quietly. &quot;I&#039;ll handle this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you won&#039;t hurt them, will you?&quot; Fluttershy asked. &quot;They&#039;re such helpless, timid creatures.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, Oak save me from the non-Awake versions of my best friends.</i> &quot;I won&#039;t hurt a hair on their heads,&quot; she reassured Fluttershy. &quot;But we&#039;re going to have to have a serious talk, and I don&#039;t think you want to hear some of the words I&#039;m going to use.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh... er... all right... but please don&#039;t be too mean to them,&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;They&#039;re not responsible for what they do when they&#039;re panicked.&quot; Fluttershy fluttered off, and Twilight waited until she was out of sight and earshot.</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, you&#039;ve had your fun,&quot; she told Angel. &quot;You&#039;ve made your point. But there are lines we do not cross in a baseline Loop. You have already crossed one. Now you&#039;re going to cut down Applejack and Winona and apologize to them both.&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny&#039;s eyes narrowed. The flamethrower vanished, replaced in a back flip by a small set of midnight-black robes. A tiny red lightsaber ignited in his paws.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes narrowed in turn, and she drew herself up as tall as she could. &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure you didn&#039;t just challenge me,&quot; she hissed. The clear blue sky above the treetops vanished behind swirling clouds, which grew darker by the moment. &quot;You, after all, are an experienced Looper, and would know better than to directly confront the Anchor of your Loop.&quot; Shadows gathered around Twilight Sparkle, forming the shape of armor and helm. &quot;An Anchor who has a thousand Loops for your one. An Anchor who can summon godlike power merely by an instant act of will.&quot; Twilight&#039;s eyes began to glow, their pupils taking on a reptilian slit shape. &quot;An Anchor who has merely promised not to harm a hair on your head, saying nothing whatever about the rest of your body.&quot; Lightning flashed overhead, sending distinct Nightmare-ish shadows across the bunnies, who cowered in terror. &quot;And an Anchor who has just had a very bad Loop, wants some peace and quiet, <i>isn&#039;t getting it,</i> and wants the annoyance to <i><b>go away.</b></i> &quot;</p><p class="double">Eternal Twilight towered over Darth Gel, a deep purple shadow of menace almost blotting out a tiny flicker of darkness. &quot;You weren&#039;t challenging me, were you now?&quot; The voice hissed on the edge of pony hearing, and even a few of the bunnies had to strain to catch the words.</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny calmly weighed the situation, considered his alternatives, and made a decision.</p><p class="double">The red lightsaber flashed twice.</p><p class="double">Smoldering ropes fell away from Applejack and Winona, who topped forward off their stakes and onto the woodpile beneath them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good,&quot; Twilight Sparkle said. &quot;Now apolo...&quot;</p><p class="double">A loud snore broke into the conversation. Applejack, who had been exhausted as usual when the bunny census had begun, had passed out asleep long before. Now, released from the ropes, she could get the deep breaths necessary to really saw some logs.</p><p class="double">&quot;On second thought, you gather every single bunny in and around Ponyville and get to work picking apples. Each bunny gets two apples for their day&#039;s work. And if you skive off or take more apples for yourself...&quot; Twilight&#039;s face disappeared completely into shadow, leaving only those glowing eyes. <i>&quot;I&#039;ll know.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Angel raised one eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Or else what?&#039;&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;Do you really want an answer to that question?&quot; Wings made of the interstellar void spread from her back, blotting out the sky and the forest.</p><p class="double">Angel, apparently unafraid, shrugged, raised a paw, and snapped his digits. The other bunnies threw away their torches and began hopping towards Sweet Apple Acres.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s better.&quot; Twilight relaxed, and, in an instant, all of the shadows, clouds, and lightning vanished under the light of a sunny day. &quot;And I&#039;ll still expect you to apologize when Applejack wakes up... in two or three days.&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel rolled his eyes and hopped away.</p><p class="double"><i>What I have to go through to get that rabbit to behave,</i> Twilight sighed. <i>How does Awake Fluttershy manage it?</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>And the Rest Loop: Griffon the Brush-Off</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had been, up to that point, a very quiet day, which Twilight Sparkle had enjoyed. She&#039;d slept in, awakened to a late breakfast cooked by Spike, and then curled up at a reading table with one of her favorite bad-Loop-recovery books, <i>Literary Analysis of the Ancient Lays of the Middle Minotauran Republic, Volume 2.</i> It was a stultifying boring work that could send Rainbow Dash to sleep in seven words or less. Twilight had only read it eighty-two times.</p><p class="double">Then the brass band kicked in, followed by cheering and shouting and the tramping of far, far too many feet.</p><p class="double">Twilight stuck her head out the library door just in time to see a train of elephants, one after another after another, walking past and through Ponyville&#039;s main square, tossing bits at the bewildered ponies watching. A very familiar-looking griffon sat on the back of the lead elephant, led in the procession by a turban-wearing Pinkie Pie. Pinkie had already begun to sing at a pitch that carried through the whole of Ponyville:</p><p class="double"><i>Princess G, Fabulous she, Gilda the Griffon!</p><p class="double">Genuflect, show some respect, down on one knee</p><p class="double">Now try hard to keep your cool</p><p class="double">The manners you learned in school</p><p class="double">And come and join her splendiferous party</p><p class="double">Princess G, Mighty is she, Gilda the Griffon!</p><p class="double">Strong as ten regular hens, definitely!</p><p class="double">She faced the emperor&#039;s hordes</p><p class="double">Their claws and their beaks and their swords</p><p class="double">Who shut them all down with one word?</p><p class="double">Why, Princess G</p><p class="double">She&#039;s got seventy-five hot air balloons</p><p class="double">Fighting squadrons</p><p class="double">She&#039;s got twenty-three</p><p class="double">When it comes to obedient goons</p><p class="double">Two thousand and two</p><p class="double">Give or take a few</p><p class="double">Who serve obediently</p><p class="double">Princess G, beautiful she, Gilda the Griffon!</p><p class="double">Those golden eyes triggering sighs of sheer ecstasy</p><p class="double">Not to mention that she&#039;s rich</p><p class="double">Which means when she gets hitched</p><p class="double">Her hubby can swim in the Griffonian treasury</p><p class="double">Princess G, Imperial She, Gilda the Griffon!</p><p class="double">Because she won, she rules griffons absolutely</p><p class="double">And she&#039;s come to our town</p><p class="double">To let her feathers down</p><p class="double">So give a Ponyville welcome to-</i></p><p class="double">Pinkie, and perforce the whole procession, came to a sudden halt as a griffon messenger descended from the skies, handed a scroll to Pinkie Pie, tipped his cap to her, and flew away again.</p><p class="double">Pinkie opened the scroll and read aloud: &quot;To whom it may concern; due to the incredible expense of the diplomatic mission to Equestria, the government of Griffonia has collapsed. The griffons have created a new republic in its place. Therefore let it be known that Gilda the Griffon is immediately deposed as ruler of the griffons and that any drafts made by her on the treasury of Griffonia from this date forward shall not be honored.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda found herself dumped to the street. Ten seconds later the elephants, band, servants, soldiers, flower girls, and fan-wielding male harem had vanished to the four winds, or as close to them as the streets of Ponyville would allow.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged and began a new song and dance:</p><p class="double"><i>For she&#039;s a flat broke ex-Princess,</p><p class="double">For she&#039;s a flat broke ex-Princess,</p><p class="double">For she&#039;s a flat broke ex-Princess,</p><p class="double">Which nopony can deny!</i></p><p class="double">At which point Pinkie pulled a cupcake out of her mane, handed it to Gilda with a smile, and trotted away.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash, who had been watching the parade from above, swooped down to land beside Gilda. &quot;Hey, Gilda,&quot; she said. &quot;That was kinda harsh, y&#039;know? They coulda at least let ya keep one elephant.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh,&quot; Gilda shrugged, &quot;easy come, easy go. I&#039;m sure something else will come up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wanna hang out at my place until you get back on your wings?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, I&#039;d like that,&quot; Gilda said. &quot;I&#039;ll be along in a while... I need to look and see if I can scrape any of those bits my boys were throwing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I understand,&quot; Dash nodded. &quot;Catch you later!&quot;</p><p class="double">As the rainbow-maned pegasus zoomed off, Twilight walked up to the griffon and said, &quot;I have to say, that wasn&#039;t a bad prank at all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What prank?&quot; Gilda asked. &quot;This was a serious diplomatic mission.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cocked her head. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda looked grumpy for another three seconds. Then one corner of her beak turned up as she added, &quot;I was saving the really silly stuff for Celestia.&quot; She held up four extremely large saddle shoes and sighed. &quot;Do you know how hard it is to find trained tap-dancing elephants?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.2 (Pinklestia)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Somepony slowly opened the door to Big Macintosh&#039;s bar, and a black Earth pony colt walked inside. He was wearing a Batman costume, one look and Mac knew he was the real deal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey boss, been a while, first time in Equestria?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot; Batman said and sat in front of the counter.</p><p class="double">&quot;So... care to talk about what&#039;s bugging you?&quot; Mac served him a drink, not alcoholic, but looked like one at first glance, is what Bruce drank when he was being at a social event or he was pretending to get drunk.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am fictional this loop.&quot; Bruce then sipped his drink, with an ease that showed that he had indeed been a pony before. Mac didn&#039;t say anything else, waiting for him to go on and he started to clean the mugs and glasses. It was still quite early and there wasn&#039;t much else to do. After a moment, Batman continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not in the sense that I am a fictional character, but that I am an actor portraying Bat Colt in a TV series, everypony knows who I am. I am famous. Ponies just won&#039;t leave me alone!&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac understood, Batman wasn&#039;t the most social guy around, save when he was playing the role of playboy millionaire. But even then, it was just an act, for a loner like Batman, being the centre of attention and being forced to act nice all the time was torture.</p><p class="double">&quot;You could retire.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I actually enjoy being an actor.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac raised an eyebrow &quot;Then...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Cutie Mark Crusaders won a prize in a contest, meet the actor that portrays Bat Colt, and they get a minor scene in the show. They aren&#039;t awake and I have to deal with them for a week.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac silently switched Batman&#039;s drink for something hard. While he never saw Bruce getting drunk, it seemed this time he actually needed to.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.3 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Loop Trek: The Next Iteration -- &quot;Encounter at Farfetched&quot;</p><p class="double">Captain Celestia paused in her walk around the bridge of the <i>Enterprise</i> to allow the loop memories to settle.</p><p class="double"><i>Ah. This again. I wonder what the crew lottery came up with this time.</i></p><p class="double">Glancing around, she concluded that this was a ponified variant, rather than a straight substitute-into-bipeds fusion.</p><p class="double">There was Twilight in Data&#039;s seat at Conn. <i>I wonder how often she gets slotted into scientific support roles.</i></p><p class="double">She did not recognize the pony at Ops. <i>Oh dear. Redshirt. Must make an effort to save that one if possible.</i></p><p class="double">She noted Diamond Tiara speaking to Gilda at the Tactical station. <i>Tasha and Worf. Rather predictable...</i></p><p class="double">Cadance was in the Counselor&#039;s chair. <i>And loop memories indicate that we&#039;ll be meeting with Shining Armor, Zecora, and Apple Bloom at Deneb IV.</i></p><p class="double">As she moved to peer over Twlight&#039;s shoulder, the unicorn murmured, &quot;Two Generosities, one Kindness, and another Magic so far.&quot; More loudly, she announced. &quot;Unknown sensor contact directly ahead, approaching rapidly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There is a very powerful mind out there,&quot; added Cadance in an almost bored tone of voice as she idly examined her left front hoof-shoe.</p><p class="double">&quot;And here it comes,&quot; muttered DT to Gilda as the view screen was filled with a tessellating pattern. The griffon grunted in acknowledgement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi guys!&quot; said the draconequus after she flashed into existence.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, Silver. Are you here to judge if ponykind is a savage and unworthy race?&quot; asked Celestia politely.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah. Technically, I&#039;m here to help judge if ponykind is a boring and uninteresting race. Discord and Q are running interference with the Continuum, and I got stuck with the public appearances. I feel obliged to point out that you don&#039;t have any Elements of Laughter available just now, so you&#039;re at a slight disadvantage for the trial...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.4 (Gamerex27)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The door to Mac&#039;s bar slowly crept open, and Pinkie Pie walked in. She didn&#039;t bounce, or skip, or even teleport in from under a stool. No, she walked in. This, in Mac&#039;s experience, was always a bad sign.</p><p class="double">Her mane a mix between its usually poofy self and flat, Pinkie eased herself onto a seat at the bar top, and sighed.</p><p class="double">Mac didn&#039;t say anything: he didn&#039;t want to risk upsetting her. He merely continued to clean his mugs.</p><p class="double">Mac took a second look at his customer, and instantly understood what was wrong. On Pinkie Pie&#039;s forehoof was a large orange bracelet.</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s gaze slowly trailed to her bracelet, and then made eye contact with Mac.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have diabetes this Loop,&quot; she said, her voice missing all of its usual cheer.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Magic</i> diabetes,&quot; she clarified, as Mac opened his mouth to give advice. &quot;Twilight&#039;s done everything she could to cure it, but nothing worked.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Mac said, &quot;it&#039;ll only be for this Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it&#039;s so <i>annoying!</i>&quot; Pinkie&#039;s mane fully deflated and turned totally flat. &quot;I can barely eat one tiny cookie without risking my life! I have to stop in the middle of every single party and check my glucose level just to make sure I won&#039;t pass out and wake up without my hooves! I can&#039;t even order any of my usual drinks here, &#039;cause all of them are packed with sugar!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You could just try to find some...&quot; Mac hesitated for a moment. &quot;...sugar-free snacks?&quot; he said hesitantly.</p><p class="double">The Element of Laughter twitched. &quot;I know, but they&#039;re so hard to find around here! I never noticed just how much sugar everypony uses around here to bake and cook everything! I had to go all the way to Manehattan just to find a bakery that sold all my favorite things without sugar!&quot;</p><p class="double">She sighed, and downed the shot of Berry Punch&#039;s special sugar-free brew. &quot;I...I just don&#039;t know what to do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I ain&#039;t sure what to tell ya, Pinkie. Maybe,&quot; he realized, &quot;you can just make your sugar-free snacks on your own?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie froze. Her mane instantly poofed back up, and she squeed in joy. &quot;Ohmygosh, <i>you&#039;re right!</i> Thank you so much, Maccy!&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled him into a deep kiss, then ducked underneath the stool, teleporting out of the bar.</p><p class="double">As Berry Punch walked out of the back room, she saw Mac blushing furiously.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.5 (Kingofsouls) (Gamerex27) (DrTempo) (TrueZero2) (Fractalman) (Masterweaver) (banjo2e) (Draconas) (drachefly) (send help, too many authors!)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, New round. Weirdest married couple you have seen or been in.&quot; Twilight announced to the bar patrons. She then shot a glare at Cadence. &quot;And no Cadence, that time you got everypony married to their human counterparts doesn&#039;t count.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence slammed her head into the table.</p><p class="double">&quot;I got one. I Woke up married to Davenport that one loop.&quot; Pinkie took a swig of her drink.</p><p class="double">Rainbow gave Pinkie a questioning look. &quot;Wait, the sofa and quill guy? That Davenport?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yepper-Ronnie!&quot; She sighed wistfully. &quot;Good times.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I speak for everyone present when I ask how that came to be.&quot; Rarity questioned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, he told me he really liked what I could do with a sofa.&quot;</p><p class="double">The others looked at Pinkie, wondering just how far out of context that statement really was.</p><p class="double">Shining Armor sighed, cradling his head with a hoof. &quot;Even so, that couldn&#039;t have been as bad as that one time I Woke Up married to Panty.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Loopers in the bar looked at one another, clearly having no idea who that was.</p><p class="double">&quot;She and her sister Stocking were angels who were exiled from Heaven for being too sinful in their home Loop,&quot; Shining explained. &quot;They had to fight ghosts on earth in order to get back to Heaven, and they did it by turning their clothes into weapons for some reason.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, <i>those</i> two.&quot; Twilight sighed, taking a sip of her cider. &quot;I remember them from when they replaced Celestia and Luna. I&#039;m pretty sure Panty seduced every single stallion in the Royal Guard except you. She was like a foul-mouthed, tamer version of Molestia.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nearly every Looper in the bar shuddered in unison at this.</p><p class="double">&quot;And, since she kept using human curses, nopony knew what she was talking about half the time,&quot; Twilight continued. &quot;Her sister ate so much sugar, she single-hoofedly gave the Pies enough business to open up franchise shops all over Equis. She <i>ate more cake than Celestia and Pinkie combined, for elk&#039;s sake.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped at this. &quot;Ohmygosh! That&#039;s more cake than there should ever be in one place! You can&#039;t let just one pony hog it all!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When you said they used their clothes as weapons,&quot; Rarity asked, raising an eyebrow, &quot;what do you mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They used some kind of magic to literally turn them into weapons. Panty turned her...ah, namesake into guns, and Stocking turned her socks into swords.&quot;</p><p class="double">Unexpectedly, Rarity smiled at this. &quot;<i>Finally</i>, someone finds a use for those things.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset said, &quot;Hmm...weirdest married couple I&#039;ve seen...&quot; After thinking for a few minutes, she said, &quot;I&#039;ve seen a lot of odd couples, but the one that takes the cake was an Unawake Fluttershy and Ryoga Hibiki. Fluttershy was able to actually calm Ryoga down. THAT is rare.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smirked &quot;I can beat that. An Unawake Shining Armor was married to his job one loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor slammed his head into the table.</p><p class="double">&quot;Weirdest married couple... weirdest married couple...&quot; Vinyl muttered as she tried to remember one. &quot;Probably the one where Rarity and Shino hooked up. Neither one was Awake, and Rarity fell for Shino when he saved her life during Pain&#039;s attack on the Hidden Leaf. I tell ya, not many people believed it at first. Killer reception though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Weirdest marriage? Chrysalis and C&#039;thulu. Yes, that was a marriage.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There was this one time Angel and Luna were married.&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;The moon was pretty green that Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna slammed her head into the table.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle raised a hoof. &quot;Does it have to be a couple? Cause I have a herd example...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence raised her head. &quot;Go on...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright... so we all know how Ivory ended up with Stephen Magnet and Gustav le Grand after Rarity and Spike&#039;s bachelor party--&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory rolled her eyes. &quot;Yes, go telling everypony why don&#039;t you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem. Anywho...&quot; Sweetie shrugged. &quot;One loop had herd-based marriage laws--a couple was just &#039;a herd of two&#039; and not something unique--and I <i>think</i> Spike and Gilda were awake, and they campaigned for some sort of racial equality... long story short, when me and Rarity took Manehattan, Suri Polomare was married to Garble, Gilda&#039;s third cousin, a changeling queen--not unique that loop--and Stephen Magnet.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gave an awkward little cough. &quot;They, ah... they commissioned Rarity for specialty bed sheets, and I won&#039;t elaborate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I once married a demonic overlord and a paladin. Barely remember their names at this point, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord finished his drink in a completely normal fashion, then scowled as he realized the entire bar was staring at him. &quot;Look, I think the fact that they asked <i>me,</i> of all people, to officiate the ceremony would tend to suggest they <i>might</i> not be an entirely normal couple!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia downed a shot of alcohol heated to the point of fusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s just say in one loop Luna and I had to keep up an eclipse for five days so the Sun and Moon could have their honeymoon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Of to the side, Luna cursed before trying to think of a new example.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, do fake weddings count?&quot; Rainbow Dash had put her head on a hoof in an uncharacteristic &#039;thinking&#039; pose.</p><p class="double">Twilight coughed. &quot;No, they do <i>not</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I ask &#039;cause&quot; - &quot;I just said they don&#039;t.&quot; - &quot;Twilight and I have been married a few times. Not looped in that way, but actually chose to when awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave up and let her continue.</p><p class="double">&quot;First there was the time you <i>had</i> to get married or else, and only we were awake, and we were both too worn out to fight the system. Then there was the time we were all under pressure by a set of secret police, and they tried to play us off against each other. Then there was the time we just did it to make some bigots&#039; heads explode. Oh, and pranking Cadence by getting married and divorced more and more frequently until you needed a millisecond timer to keep count - no, you haven&#039;t forgotten, that was before you ever woke up... did I miss any?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked around the room and felt a peculiar series of sensations: first, relief that the reactions were mere amusement at the situations, not anything she should be embarrassed over; second, confusion that she could still be insecure enough that that could still occur to her; third, surprise that most of her friends were still recognizably themselves after all this time and experience; and fourth, fear - of change, of loss of self, of the end of the loops by the recovery of Yggdrasil, of the end of the loops by a total crash, of data corruption changing people in ways they never chose.</p><p class="double">&quot;You okay there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I...&quot; she blinked. &quot;I think you got them all.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda&#039;s grin was quite predatory. &quot;I got one that&#039;s pretty good. Queen Celestia and Emperor Tirek.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039; s head smashed into the table, Twilight&#039; s drink being shot out of her mouth at the nearest pony (it was Rarity). &quot;<i>What!?</i>”</p><p class="double">&quot;Stealth anchor. You were replaced with one of the Yugioh anchors,&quot; responded Celestia, her head rising slightly. &quot;It was a strange loop. Tirek challenged my unawake self to single combat when he came to first Equestria. He won, and forced me to marry him. Needless to say, Equestria wasn&#039;t exactly...friendly.</p><p class="double">&quot;When I woke up, the first thing did was file a divorce by banishing him to the sun.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Was my....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry Twilight. There Was a Freak solar flare that happened after I banished him.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s head smashed into the table.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.6 (Gamerex27) (Masterweaver) (DrTempo) (LordCirce) (Ghrathyrn) (Gym Quirk) (Drachefly)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Can guest Loopers propose an idea?&quot; Iron Coat-or as he was more commonly known, Langdon- studied the glass in his hoof, wondering how he was managing to hold it without fingers. &quot;How about this: the best or most impressive way you&#039;ve ever de-railed another Loop&#039;s baseline.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a broad category,&quot; replied Twilight. &quot;Give me a minute to think of one of my better Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There was the time where we completely destroyed the plot of Romeo and Juliet,&quot; Spike pitched in. &quot;But I think my best one was when I replaced the Dovahkiin back in Skyrim.&quot;</p><p class="double">He took a sip of his drink, belched atomic fire safely into his subspace pocket, then continued. &quot;It went normally until I infiltrated the Thalmor embassy. When I found their files on how they brainwashed Ulfric to spur on the war...I showed the Imperials and Stormcloaks the documents. Right when we were negotiating the ceasefire in the civil war.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike reached his paw into his Pocket, and withdrew a picture of the Thalmor Ambassador&#039;s face during the event. Suffice to say, it was priceless.</p><p class="double">&quot;I had no idea humans could stretch their mouths so wide,&quot; remarked Octavia, from her seat next to Vinyl. &quot;Her mouth is a foot away from literally dropping to the ground.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She <i>isn&#039;t</i> human,&quot; Spike stressed. &quot;See the ears? Elves can stretch their mouths wider than humans. Anyways,&quot; he continued, &quot;they worked out peace, alright. Although, it didn&#039;t exactly go as planned.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. &quot;I don&#039;t think either of us anticipated the Empire and Stormcloaks teaming up to take on every single Thalmor in Tamriel. Even though it did lead to a golden age of prosperity and cultural understanding (somehow), the war was far more bloody than either of us wanted. Turns out lightning bolt spells travel faster than the Elements of Harmony did in that Loop.&quot; Rarity shivered, then put on a small smile. &quot;The cultural renaissance afterwards gave me ideas for some fabulous new dresses, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, alright, get this.&quot; Vinyl spread her hooves wide. &quot;I Wake Up, and I&#039;m a seapony right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyebrow rose ever so slightly. &quot;Equestrian or G3?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Neither, actually. My Loop memories tell me that I&#039;m sort of a nice girl, bit curious--obvious hero material--but beyond that, nothing. So I go swimming out of my cave and, guess who&#039;s out there? ANIKAN FREAKING SKYWALKER.&quot; Vinyl snorted. &quot;He was also a seapony, but wearing a robe.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, he explains that his pre-awake self was going to restore only some of my memory as part of a gambit, but offers to restore all of it. I decide, on a whim, to just have him restore the part he was going to cause, ya know, why the heck not.&quot; Vinyl grinned broadly. &quot;So it turns out that this whole world I&#039;m in is built on &#039;the verse&#039;--basically, think magic that can be channeled by singing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Octavia sighed in resignation. &quot;What song did you pick?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dubstep remix of our hub show theme song. Ten minutes later, a bunch of ponies in scuba gear go down to the depths and blast a depressed demigod with the powers of harmony.&quot; The unicorn leaned back with a smug smirk. &quot;Yep, that&#039;s how I completely fixed Aquaria.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset smirked. &quot;Interesting baseline derailments....Here&#039;s one. You know that loop with the animatronic puppets in that pizza place...I just blasted that place to bits.&quot; The grin on her face was wide. &quot;Problem solved. That place was going out of business anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny made a series of gestures, before twitching his nose and turning back to his drink. Sunset squinted. &quot;I don&#039;t think I caught that.&quot; She glanced at Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blushed. &quot;Oh, um, Angel was taking the place of Bonnie the Bunny that Loop. He was the first thing you hit.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset flushed. &quot;Oops.&quot; Then she paused. &quot;Hey wait, he chased me through three rooms.&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel twitched his nose and turned away.</p><p class="double">Sweetie perked up. &quot;Ooh, ooh, I got one. I was in Arda...&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom cut in. &quot;We&#039;ve all heard your Ascension Story. That doesn&#039;t count.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweetie glowered at her. &quot;This is a different time. I Looped in as Galadriel, and I managed to make Heart Songs a thing. Smaug and Bilbo did a really funny cat-and-mouse duet, the Battle of Helm&#039;s Deep turned into a giant rap battle, and Gandalf and the Eagles did this amazing Orchestral Jazz fly-over at the end of the Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, Ah think Ah&#039;ve got one!&quot; Apple Bloom said. &quot;Twilight, remember when we Woke up on Gor?&quot;</p><p class="double">The entire bar fell silent. Even Pinkie Pie, eternal engine of motion that she was, froze at the mention of Gor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait a moment.&quot; Rarity said slowly. &quot;Are you talking about <i>the</i> Gor?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That planet where those aliens abduct people from Earth and force them to live in Stone Age cultures?&quot; Fluttershy asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;The one where the men are deplorable knaves, who brainwash the women and make them their slaves?&quot; Zecora asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please tell me you two gave those aliens some justice,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, with a sharp edge to her voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course!&quot; Twilight sipped her cider. &quot;The moment our Loop memories kicked in, we Ascended, and destroyed the aliens&#039; orbital cannon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Ah wired their bases so they couldn&#039;t build anythin&#039; like that again,&quot; Apple Bloom added. &quot;Cut off their production factories, vaporized all of their teleportation technology, an&#039; put &#039;em all in a penal colony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We did leave them with a one-way video feed to Gor, though.&quot; Twilight grinned. &quot;We spent the next few years travelling the planet, making massive changes to society, and making a unified global culture.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah introduced the poor folks trapped there ta&#039; gunpowder, electricity, heatin&#039;, and all the bells n&#039; whistles. &#039;Course, we sent anyone who wanted back to Earth, but a whole bunch of &#039;em stayed to show up the jerks that put &#039;em there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We got a women&#039;s rights movement going in record time. By the time we got governments running across the planet, a little under half of the officials were females.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; the best part?&quot; Apple Bloom beamed. &quot;Them aliens couldn&#039;t do a darn thing about it. We enchanted those TVs to make &#039;em unbreakable, so they were forced to watch their big experiment fall apart.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We made them watch that sick society of oppression they had built crumble to pieces, and there was nothing that they could do about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Many of the ponies in the bar applauded. Apple Bloom blushed, and Twilight took a moment to bow on her stool.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twi?&quot; The young Apple&#039;s face turned thoughtful. &quot;Do ya think we got that world Looping? It was static when we got there, but with all th&#039; changes we made, ya think...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe? I have no idea. If we did help make an Anchor, it was probably one of those Amazons.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Interesting loops huh?&quot; The dark-maned thestral twitched her tail as she leaned against the bar, a black and white mongrel lazing at her hooves. &quot;I can think of a few breaks, not all of them mine.&quot; She grinned before sipping her drink. &quot;Actually, one was a Fallout loop, you know, the places where the entire planet ends up on the receiving end of a WMD bombardment? Well, in this case it was the… third one, where the main person has to leave the vault after their father.&quot; She snorted, shaking her head. &quot;Of course Dad was really interested in their tech, particularly the GECKs, but knowing the Enclave morons would be out there looking for it, we went a different route.</p><p class="double">&quot;Instead of us sneaking out of the vault, we browbeat the Overseer with science out the gate, cutting out a good chunk of the problems that would come later, then I shifted to Assirraya the Inferno, grabbed the nuke in Megaton and dropped it on the Enclave&#039;s heads while Tim here used his dragon form to start mucking with the ground. He got a good chunk around Megaton purged. Took us a few years to get everything done, but we got the Capital Wastes cleared, even managed to get rid of the ghoul infestations around, didn&#039;t even need the GECK when we found it.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>:What my brood-mate isn&#039;t saying is that once we found the rest of our brood things went a lot quicker, especially since we could purify the water and force weather patterns until they stuck.:</i> The dog&#039;s voice sounded in everyone&#039;s heads. <i>:The combination of Fireborn powers, Thu&#039;um and spells for purification and creation certainly helped, as did Quentin&#039;s scientific abilities. Between him and that Moira girl Megaton had products that made even those in Tenpenny Tower envious, and they couldn&#039;t really do what they had planned because we used the bomb on the Enclave.:</i> His jaw dropped in a canine laugh.</p><p class="double">Another pony, this one a pale blue pegasus snorted in amusement. &quot;And here I thought there were fewer stories like that, though that said, I remember once I looped into the place of Captain Geary, which was interesting, since we started facing summary death.&quot; He paused, sipping his drink. &quot;I&#039;ve talked to Geary, normally he tries to get everyone back the slow way since it&#039;s safer. Fortunately I had Angel and the <i>Angelwing</i> available, so we sent her over to the enemy fleet, shut down their targeting and combat systems, then I ordered my fleet to push straight for the jump gate, got back to alliance space a lot quicker and with Angel around, we found the other group of aliens pretty fast, she was able to disable their tricks and we sued for peace. Got it too, once we revealed how the entire group had been played.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack tapped her chin with a hoof. &quot;Well, Ah think mah best one might&#039;ve been when Ah was in the Kingdom Hearts Loop, and Ah replaced Aqua.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer blinked. &quot;Really? I&#039;ve never actually Looped to that part of the timeline. How did that go for you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;At the time, Ah didn&#039;t think Ah was doin&#039; anything major. Ah just asked Ventus <i>why</i> he left home, an&#039; he told me that the boy in the mask told him to find Terra. An&#039; when we met up in Radiant Garden, Ah told Terra that he needed to come back to the Land of Departure &#039;cause Ah was suspicious of Xehanort. And <i>then</i> Ah told him that the masked boy sent Ventus to find <i>him.</i>&quot; She smiled. &quot;Amazing what just askin&#039; a few questions can do. It didn&#039;t take long before we realized that Xehanort was running us &#039;round in circles and manipulatin&#039; all of us, an&#039; before you knew it, we&#039;d foiled all his plans by just <i>not</i> goin&#039; to that graveyard.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, you fixed the problems of the whole baseline...by doing <i>nothing</i>? Except asking a few questions?&quot; Sunset looked incredulous at this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nearly every bad thing that happened in that Loop was his fault. All we had to do was be honest with each other, an&#039; we stopped everythin&#039; bad from happening.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow.&quot; Sunset removed a notebook from her pocket, and began writing in it. &quot;The next time I Loop back into Kingdom Hearts, I&#039;ll be sure to tell this to Sora and the others.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not sure if you need to. Ah think Xehanort was usin&#039; some kind of Suggestion spell to push those two boys into following the rails of his scheme. &#039;Course, since Ah&#039;m the Element of Honesty, that kind of spell doesn&#039;t work on me, so it didn&#039;t take that long ta notice somethin&#039; was off about the whole thing. Ah think any Looper worth their salt would notice the road apples he was layin&#039;, even if he didn&#039;t use any mind-control magic in the baseline.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy shrank into herself even more than usual. &quot;I managed to mess up the Barrayaran Empire pretty badly. I was doing Miles&#039; Academy entrance exam and took my time and was very careful during the physical fitness portion...&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll said, &quot;The loop I derailed most thoroughly? When Dr. Fetus abducted my boyfriend, I called in OSHA. They shut him down after taking one look at his factory.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack dryly asked, &quot;Oh! Is that loop why you were deathly afraid of salt for a while? Anyway, once I was in a loop loosely based on our admins. In this variant, Wotan had the worst head for money I&#039;ve ever heard of - and yes, I&#039;ve seen my baseline. When the loop started, he&#039;d already bought an enormous sky palace from two giants, with no down payment, no regular source of income, and me - his sister-in-law - as collateral. Without my permission. And moreover, I gave all of our family and friends our immortality.&quot;</p><p class="double">A pause while that sunk in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. So anyway, I married both of them and sent a golden-apple care package home every few days. Also, we had to go keep Alberich from taking over the world, but by then the plot rails were out of sight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity coughed. &quot;You married <i>Fasolt and Fafnir</i> for a loop that&#039;s a few hundred years long?&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack snorted. &quot;Memory charms worked for a while. Then Fafnir got himself cursed by Alberich. Once the Rhine maidens had drowned him, it was just me and Fasolt. He was actually all right.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.7 (Masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lyra, Lyra, Lyra, Lyra, and a sweet roll all sat in their designated places around the meeting table. Lyra Classic tapped her hoof against it. &quot;I now call this meeting of The Increasingly Confusing Council of Lyra&#039;s Head to order! Roll call...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, we can all count, and we all know each other. We&#039;re all here. Get on with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh, fine. First order of business, who is in charge this time? Please note we are a code 7 this time, a seapony in disguise.&quot;</p><p class="double">Human Lyra raised her hand with a grin. &quot;My turn! I&#039;ve never been in charge while we were a seapony before! This should be fun!&quot;</p><p class="double">Seapony Lyra shrugged. &quot;Just watch the instincts and you should be fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">Classic nodded. &quot;Any objections? ... No? Okay then next on the agenda, cake.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seapony Lyra grinned. &quot;Are we all still in agreement that we are getting a piece of the MMMM at any cost this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Science Lyra nodded. &quot;No question! We&#039;ve never so much as smelled the thing before! How can we replicate it for BonBon&#039;s birthday if we don&#039;t have even the slightest clue what it tastes like!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I agree. We know the damage can be fixed before the contest anyway, so overall, no harm done.&quot; Classic Lyra declared sagely.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... I just like cake.&quot; Human Lyra shrugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;...&quot; said the sweet roll.</p><p class="double">Human Lyra blushed. &quot;I didn&#039;t mean it like that and you know it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Right, most of the rest of the schedule is routine stuff, but there is one last thing here. Twilight&#039;s offer of Alicornhood.&quot;</p><p class="double">Science Lyra sighed and slumped over the table. &quot;Look, we all know what you&#039;re thinking. It SHOULD merge us all. But what SHOULD happen, and what WILL happen, are not always the same! Case in point, the elephant in the room.&quot; she frowned, gesturing to the head of the table.</p><p class="double">The table that, prior to Twilight&#039;s offer, not HAD a head of the table.</p><p class="double">And most tellingly, the brand new, Alicorn sized empty chair that had appeared at it, awaiting its owner.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.8 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The guard looked confused as Twilight began walking away, leaving her friends to enter for the Gala. &quot;You&#039;re... not coming in?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no. I gave away my ticket.&quot; She said offhoofedly, barely turning back to respond.</p><p class="double">&quot;But... you&#039;re Twilight Sparkle. Princess Celestia&#039;s <i>private student</i>. You don&#039;t <i>need</i> an invitation. You could just... go to the gala, if you want.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight turned back to stare at the guard, her friends blinking inquisitively off to the side as she tilted her head and her mane began to frazzle.</p><p class="double">Somewhere, off in the distance, a goat bleated.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">119.1 continued (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>And the Rest Loop: The Ticket Master</b></p><p class="double">Twilight stood and watched with a twitching eyebrow as Applejack and Rainbow Dash hoofwrestled for the never-to-be-sufficiently-damned-to-Tartarus tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala. The Gala itself was about fifth or sixth on the list of Parts of the Baseline Twilight Absolutely Hates; the day Celestia actually sends the tickets ranked second on that last, only marginally worse than Tirek blowing up the library but nothing like as bad as the Want-It, Need-It incident. When in a good mood she&#039;d play along just enough to find something amusing in Canterlot, without re-enacting the original, horrible, no-good, very worst night ever. Now, when she wanted peace, quiet, and familiar, comfortable things- and nothing else... not a chance.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d tried just giving Applejack and Rainbow Dash one ticket each before; that worked out even worse than baseline, with her other three close friends resorting to bribery, deceit and theft to get the tickets for themselves. One Loop things had become so bad between them that Twilight had been forced to cancel the Gala altogether... by blowing up Celestia&#039;s castle. She&#039;d spent the rest of that loop on the Moon, with time off to deal with Discord and for weddings... but at least her friends made up during her trial.</p><p class="double">Twilight was about to set the tickets on fire and give Rote Speech #2G (Nobody is Going to the Gala and I am Sorely Disappointed in All of You) when the Mayor&#039;s carefully cultivated voice said, &quot;Oh, Twilight Sparkle, there you are!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Ivory- er, Ms. Mayor?&quot; Twilight replied, glad to take her eyes off two of her closest friends being total idiots for the (vague eight or nine figure number here)th iteration.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I&#039;ve just been catching up on some paperwork regarding your transfer of residency to Ponyville,&quot; Ivory Scroll said. &quot;You know, of course, that Ponyville recently adopted the Sweethaven tax code?&quot;</p><p class="double">Warning bells rang in the back of Twilight&#039;s mind. <i>Sweethaven... I know that- oh, no...</i> &quot;You mean the Commodore&#039;s Code? But that was repealed!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, so I don&#039;t need to explain it to you,&quot; Ivory Scroll smiled. &quot;So, let me just go over the charges: departure of residency tax from Canterlot... beginning of residency tax in Ponyville... are you renting a home here, by the way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know I&#039;m not!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lack of residency tax,&quot; Ivory nodded, checking off a scroll that kept unwinding longer and longer as the mayor kept listing itemized charges. &quot;Habitation of a public building tax... magic tax, progressive according to power ranking of unicorn... keeping of pet parenthesis dragon close parenthesis tax... keeping of hazardous materials parenthesis dragon close parenthesis tax... opening public building, service or accommodation tax... er, is the library open at the moment?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, Spike and I are both here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Closing public building, service or accommodation tax,&quot; Ivory continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, doesn&#039;t my stipend from Princess Celestia cover-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Special stipend income tax...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess not.&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;Look, just let me see the bottom line, all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory showed the final amount to Twilight, who gawped. If she went to Smoky Mountain in about, oh, three weeks and stole the not-yet-arrived dragon&#039;s hoard, that might cover it... almost.</p><p class="double">&quot;Since there are prolonged hearings and court procedures regarding the garnishment of royal stipends,&quot; Ivory Scroll continued, &quot;the township of Ponyville shall settle for the seizure of all your possessions of real value. As of this moment, according to our best understanding, those consist of two exclusive tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala, correct?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I thought that&#039;s where all this was headed,&quot; Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then I shall be taking those tickets,&quot; the mayor continued, &quot;and in three days I shall auction them off, the proceeds to fund public works in and around Ponyville.&quot; She reached over to Spike, who held the tickets in his claws, and took them in her teeth, carefully depositing them in her saddlebags.</p><p class="double">&quot;HEY!&quot; Applejack and Rainbow Dash broke up their hoofwrestling match and dashed over to the mayor.</p><p class="double">&quot;You cain&#039;t take our friend&#039;s property like that!&quot; Applejack drawled.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right!&quot; Rainbow Dash agreed. &quot;Those tickets belong to mmmmm, er, my friend Twilight Sparkle!&quot; She snugged herself up next to Twilight and added, &quot;Isn&#039;t that right, old buddy, old pal?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid she can,&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, girls. I know how much each of you wanted to go.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not a total loss,&quot; Ivory Scroll added. &quot;You could always buy one of the tickets at auction in three days&#039; time.&quot; Putting the tax bill back in her bags, the mayor turned back for town. &quot;Thank you for your cooperation, Twilight dear.&quot; With that the mayor trotted off down the road, followed at a distance by Applejack and Rainbow Dash, both with expressions of silent thoughtfulness.</p><p class="double">Twilight waited for all three to go over the hill and out of sight before she let the evil, evil smile show on her face.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">That evening, after the scheduled rainstorm, Twilight sat in the library&#039;s reading room, sipped some tea from her cup, and read to the delightful sounds of a Ponyville mob growing ever more disgruntled by the minute. Sweet, sweet music.</p><p class="double">For a moment the muffled sound of shouting angry ponies became much less muffled as the front door swung wide open; it slammed shut again an instant later, and after a couple of tables and one of the mobile bookshelves was shoved in front of it the sounds became muffled again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, Twilight Sparkle,&quot; Ivory Scroll said nervously, &quot;it appears that the ratification of the Sweethaven tax code had some, er, legal irregularities which renders the tax bill you owe-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re here to give the tickets back, aren&#039;t you?&quot; Twilight said calmly, turning a page of her book.</p><p class="double">&quot;PLEASE!&quot; Ivory cried, falling to her knees and crawling to Twilight, forehooves clenched together in supplication. &quot;At least two-thirds of Ponyville is after those tickets or my dead body or both!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your dead body?&quot; Twilight asked, apparently unconcerned.</p><p class="double">&quot;I may have let slip that I meant to keep one of the tickets for myself,&quot; Ivory Scroll admitted. &quot;You know, rig the sealed bidding.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oopsie,&quot; Twilight smirked. &quot;Possibly you shouldn&#039;t have used your outside-the-head voice for that. I have that problem sometimes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was Derpy!&quot; the mayor cried. &quot;Sweet, innocent, non-Awake Derpy! Who would have imagined she was that desperate to see Princess Celestia and get Dinky Doo a shot at Celestia&#039;s School for Gifted Unicorns?&quot; The mayor stared over her pince-nez at Twilight with terror-filled eyes. &quot;And when you&#039;ve lost Derpy Hooves, Twilight, take it from a pony who knows, you&#039;ve lost all of Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gee, that&#039;s sad,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;And yet... not my problem.&quot; She turned her attention back to her book.</p><p class="double">&quot;PLEASE, Twilight, you HAVE to help me!!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not my circus, not my ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll do ANYTHING!&quot; Ivory sobbed.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a deep breath and smiled. Time to end the suffering. &quot;I want you to write a thousand times, &#039;I will not use my phenomenal bureaucratic powers for personal gain.&#039; And I want a new public library built on the other side of town from this tree before Tirek escapes. Promise?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! Yes!!&quot; Ivory gasped. &quot;Just please get me out of this mess!&quot; After a moment she added, &quot;And if it&#039;s at all possible, leave me with a decent chance of re-election.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow. &quot;I thought you enjoyed the occasional escape from your duties.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t enjoy the humiliation of losing an election!&quot; Ivory raised a hoof to her throat, gulped, and added, &quot;Or my head!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, then raised her voice. &quot;SPIKE! Come here, please, I need you to take a letter!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">Today I learned that it&#039;s not a good idea to use public authority for your own purposes, even if your intentions are good. You&#039;ll only end up making yourself look bad- to say nothing of the government which you represent. Only by being fair and impartial can a public servant gain the trust and friendship of the people she works with.</p><p class="double">On a related note, I strongly urge that the entire Ponyville district be issued invitations to the Grand Galloping Gala, in order to maintain the peace and to uphold the civil authority. I know Canterlot Castle won&#039;t hold all of Ponyville in comfort, so I will spend my free time over the next six months winnowing out those ponies whose interest in the Gala is only tangential to other unrelated affairs. I ask that you help me in this by being available to such ponies as I send to you for personal interviews.</p><p class="double">If you could please respond at once so I can prevent our mayor from being ridden out of town on a rail, I would really appreciate it.</p><p class="double">Your faithful student,</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle</i></p><p class="double"><u>P.

They&#039;d seen that manic grin on the princess&#039;s face in the past and knew it meant nothing good for somepony or other. None of them wanted to be that somepony.</p><p class="double">Without bothering to cancel court, Celestia dashed off her throne, galloped across the castle to Luna&#039;s tower, and crashed into her sister&#039;s bedchamber. &quot;Lulu, Lulu, guess what?&quot; she grinned, giggling in excitement.</p><p class="double">Luna raised a sleepy head. Her mane still hadn&#039;t recovered its magical luster, and the pillow hadn&#039;t helped matters either. &quot;Sister, what are you talking about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Six months from now,&quot; Celestia chortled, &quot;we are going to have the <i>Best.

You&#039;ll thank me later!&quot;</p><p class="double">She then teleported the both of them both into the center of the sun, where the loop abruptly ended.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Several loops later, Twilight found Queen Chrysalis sitting in Mac&#039;s Bar the day after the Summer Sun Celebration. Sitting down next to the already-drinking changeling who was circled by full drinks and yet more empty ones, she remarked, &quot;Well, it&#039;s later.

But still... <i>&quot;What!?&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Chrysalis visibly shuddered. &quot;Yeeeeah, they acted mostly like normal changelings before the loop started, but then they were <i>all awake</i> and... Haha, no.&quot; She shook her head vigorously. &quot;Noooo nonono.&quot; She took a swig from a new drink and sighed. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, by the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">After sucking in a deep breath and letting it out slowly, Twilight nodded. &quot;Apology accepted. I&#039;m still a tad miffed about being flash-fried, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a chuckle, the queen pushed one of her full glasses toward the princess. &quot;I&#039;ll buy your drink?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her brow wrinkled as she asked, &quot;Does Mac even <i>charge</i> for drinks?&quot; It&#039;d been so long since he&#039;d started the bar that she was honestly not sure what its original policies might have been.</p><p class="double">&quot;You wanna ask?&quot; At least Chrysalis was smiling again.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Buck</i> no. My tab must be <i>astronomical </i>by now if he does.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion in question, at the far side of the bar cleaning a glass, nodded to himself as he watched the two laughing.

Then Gilda showed up. “Ello, Sunbutt.”</p><p class="double">Silence fell as the nobles turned to stare.</p><p class="double">Two seconds passed. “AHHHHHHHHHH!”</p><p class="double">‘Sunbutt’ giggled while Gilda muttered “I’ve seen them go into a panic when I’ve called Celestia fat-butt before, but this is the first time I’ve seen them panic over the nickname Sunbutt.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.2 (fractalman)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy placed some barrels around the tree. “Ok Mr. Tree, it’s time to let go of your apples.”-and it did.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Yeeehaw!” yelled Applejack, as she lassoed the next cloud into position.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Most ponies agreed that Rarity’s parties were “pretty good, as long as she remembers that not everypony likes caviar”.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“One little bunny, two little kitty, three little gummy, four little snakey…”</p><p class="double">The animals weren’t quite sure what to make of the pink…thing in the house, but they did agree on one thing: she was more interesting than clawing up curtains or running around making a mess.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Rainbow Dash always dresses in style-and you can too, at the Carousel boutique!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Unlike the disastrous cutie-mark swapping of baseline, Twilight’s friends were quite happy in their new roles. Twilight decided she’d let her unawake friends stay the way they were for now…if she could break Rainbow’s habit of saying “Rainbow Dash always dresses in style”. That simply had to go.</p><p class="double">First things first, though, she had to figure out who cast Starswirl&#039;s incomplete spell, before the caster did something stupid with it...like ascending everypony at once.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.3 (Novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Sunset Shimmer turned the page of her Hoofbeat magazine, engrossing herself in the juice rumor and gossip the pages provided. It was proving more interesting than her current job of protecting the Blue Intelligence Briefcase.</p><p class="double">*Whoosh*</p><p class="double">Sunset jerked her head up, looking left and right for the source of the sound that had interrupted her. However, nothing presented itself as the source of the sound. As immediately as it started, it stopped. Shrugging, Sunset went back to her magazine, assuming that the noise was nothing to be concerned...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;So, class.&quot; Cheerilee said, pausing the video. &quot;What exactly did Sunset Shimmer do wrong?&quot; A handful of hooves went into the air, each attempting to be the one to answer. &quot;Yes, Applejack&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack put her hoof down. &quot;She ignored the sound. Even if it ends up being nothing, you can&#039;t take that risk.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee nodded. &quot;That&#039;s one of many things, yes. When you are responsible for the security of someone or something, you must assume that any noise made could be from someone with hostile intentions. And that means you must be alert at all times. Which Miss Shimmer was clearly not. Now, watch what could happen to you in such a situation.&quot; She turned back towards the television and pressed play...</p><p class="double"><i>...she flipped a page, her need for sordid gossip overtaking common sense and her awareness as a human figure dressed in a nice suit with a red mask on walked into view behind her, a butterfly knife clutched in his hand. A sudden clamping of Sunset Shimmer&#039;s mouth, followed by a quick motion with the knife across the throat, and in a few seconds the only living thing in the room was him. Grabbing the Briefcase, he walked calmly out of the camera&#039;s view.</i></p><p class="double">Cheerilee pressed &quot;pause&quot; again, and turned towards the class, many of which were in a state of shock. &quot;Now, that was a simulated event, and nobody actually died. But there are many Loops out there where not paying attention can end badly. Especially in the role of the security guard.&quot; She then smiled, as the sound of a Pinkie Pie-rung school bell echoed through the class, as students started getting ready to go home. &quot;Remember that the lesson on guards and teamwork is tomorrow, so study up!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, how did the class go?&quot; Twilight Sparkle asked the schoolteacher, both of who were currently in Mac&#039;s Bar, the usual place for unwinding.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it feels so good to teach ponies and actually have the lessons <i>stick</i> after a Loop Reset.&quot; Cheerilee gushed, swaying a tad bit in her seat. &quot;And I can play the role of both the teacher <i>and </i>the student! I&#039;d actually learned quite a bit of guard duty from some loopers. Actually, I looped in as a guard at this pizza place a few loops ago and got to test some of my skills. See if I&#039;d picked it up enough to teach. And thanks to the animatronics there, I had!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m assuming this was why you&#039;re teaching it now.&quot; Twilight said, getting a nod in response. &quot;Well, I&#039;m glad this is working out for you. And if you ever need me to assist with your lessons ...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee put a hoof to her chin. &quot;You know, I do need to make a few videos for my next subject, and you could be the perfect subject. It&#039;s about checklists!&quot;</p><p class="double">The grin on Twilight&#039;s face told all that needed to be said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.4 (novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! Twilight-sempai!&quot;</p><p class="double">A slow sigh escaped from &#039;Twilight-sempai&#039;. &quot;Hai, Rari-chan?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, Sempai noticed me!&quot; Rarity responded, posing dramatically for a couple of seconds, which Twilight would swear cherry blossoms petals blew past both of them, before Rarity became as serious as the situation would allow. &quot;So, have we turned Japanese this loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I really think so&quot; Twilight looked around at their current location, which to no surprise was a traditional High School. &quot;It&#039;s not Eiken, which is good...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, thank Kami!&quot; Rarity exclaimed, before stopping to consider the fact that &quot;Kami&quot; was used rather than a plant-based word. &quot;This is going to be a thing this loop, isn&#039;t it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hai.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">From the Journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">My next Loop was the Fate/Stay Night Loop, with me in Rin Tohsaka&#039;s role.</p><p class="double">Basically, the big thing here is that seven magic users summon seven legendary heroes, or &quot;Servants&quot; for the proper term, to fight in a big battle royale. The prize to the winner? The &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, which grants a wish to the winner.</p><p class="double">I wouldn&#039;t use it, even if it wasn&#039;t corrupted by an evil being to twist any wish to cause the end of the world. Too darn risky.</p><p class="double">Anyway, I&#039;d heard that more often than not, other Loopers get summoned as Servants here a lot. Such was the case for me, as my Archer wasn&#039;t the baseline one Rin got, but Pit from the Kid Icarus Loops. After the introductions, we quickly ran to save the Anchor, Shirou Emiya. He wants to be a hero, but ends up never thinking about his own survival. At least, he used to from what I&#039;ve heard, but from what I noticed, his Awake self&#039;s gotten past that. As we were about to fight the Servant Berserker, something blasted it to oblivion first.</p><p class="double">Deciding to solve that later, I took the chance to spar with Shirou&#039;s Servant, Saber, who&#039;s actually King Arthur, but a girl. Even with all my experience from my Loops, she still kicked my sorry flank easily. OUCH.</p><p class="double">Things went close to baseline after that until our confrontation with the Servant Caster...who was Pit&#039;s boss, Palutena. As Pit&#039;d figured, she&#039;d been the one to send Berserker packing. However, the wild card, Gilgamesh, showed up, and despite her best efforts, Palutena fell, and Pit decided to take Gilgamesh with him in an act of self-sacrifice. The rest of the Loop was simply making sure the Grail wasn&#039;t used, and taking down the two main villains here, Kirei and Zouken. They give me the chills...Utter monsters, both of them. I did enjoy sending those two to their fate.</p><p class="double">In all, it was an exciting Loop. I got a few new tricks, and sparring with Saber sharpened my sword skills a bit. Pity about Pit, though. Hope his next Loop is better than this...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(DrTempo)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">From the journal of Sunset Shimmer:</p><p class="double">My next stop was the Pokemon world; namely, the version where Ash&#039;s Pikachu is the Anchor. I was in the Unova region at the time he was, and was focused on entering the Pokemon League there. I started with a Tepig, and before long, I was caught up in Team Plasma&#039;s antics. You&#039;d think they&#039;d realize Pokemon and humans are perfectly fine working together. But considering Ghetsis was pulling the strings, they were deluded. Jerk.</p><p class="double">Besides that mess, my life was more or less that of your usual Pokemon Trainer; nothing unique, really. I didn&#039;t win the Pokemon League; in fact, Ash easily beat me. It was fun, though.</p><p class="double">It was a fun journey, though, and I made a few friends, including Ash himself. It sucks my Pokemon couldn&#039;t join me in the Loops, but rules are rules.</p><p class="double">Nice breather Loop for me, though, after my last Loop.. Knowing my luck, my next Loop won&#039;t be as peaceful...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.5 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and her friends, Awake and otherwise, had been in something of a bind. It was one of those weird rare variants where non-native powers didn&#039;t quite work right, if they worked at all, and the power levels of loopers in general were nerfed to roughly baseline levels. It was also one of those variants where events veered so greatly from the baseline that foreknowledge was all but useless.</p><p class="double">Which had ultimately led to them getting trapped in the local version of the Everfree by a pack of timberwolves just large enough to overwhelm them. And then the sounds of general flank-kicking began and the timberwolves started flying.</p><p class="double">And what a group of stallions it was. They weren&#039;t overly muscled like Bulk Biceps tended towards, but their muscles were evident enough that baseline Big Mac would have looked kind of ordinary next to them. Plus they were clad in the kind of barbarian-style outfits that seemed to exist solely to highlight musculature.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my,&quot; Rarity tittered and blushed. Though Twilight suspected all of the mares were blushing. Most Loops she herself wasn&#039;t generally in the market for a romantic and/or physical relationship, but that didn&#039;t mean she was blind. Yowza.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you fine stallions?&quot; Applejack asked as more timberwolves were sent flying.</p><p class="double">One of the stallions cleared his throat and in deep manly baritones, the six began to sing as they fought.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Call upon the He-Ponies when you&#039;re in distress! Mighty as can be ponies, simply signal S.O.S!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ah, Prince Blueblood. The Ponce of Ponydom, the Ninny of Nobility, the Moron of Magic.</p><p class="double">Well... most of the time.</p><p class="double">Eighty five percentish of the loops he was merely a buffoon. Granted, he could be a foolish one or dangerously cunning in his grasp of noble law, whether he was classist or racist or simply superior could flip and flop, and exactly how much power he actually had waxed and waned at random.</p><p class="double">The remaining fifteen percent of the time was split between &quot;Tired of gold diggers,&quot; where his act at the Gala was merely an act, &quot;Crushing on somepony,&quot; where he was actually very reasonable but doggedly loyal to somebody, and &quot;No sense of self worth,&quot; where he put Celestia on a pedestal and simply believed himself to be a pointless appendix to the nation. It was that last one that saddened and frustrated the loopers the most, to the point where they would always subtly check around for the signs before even planning to step foot in Canterlot, let alone go to the gala. Building up this version of Blueblood was something of a priority to them, both due to their status as a sanctuary loop and...</p><p class="double">...well...</p><p class="double">...nobody wanted the Ponce to be looping, to be completely honest.</p><p class="double">Still, even knowing that they had to be careful, Twilight found it hard to suppress a giggle at the current situation.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no, Auntie, you need to... use your magic. With your horn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooooooh.&quot; Celestia prodded at the keratin on her head, staring wide eyed at the staring horizon. &quot;Okay, so I just point it at the mountains and the sun will come up?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. No. You need to use your magic...&quot; Blueblood levitated a small flower. &quot;Like this, but on the sun.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...how are you doing that?&quot; The alicorn stared at the flower in amazement. &quot;It&#039;s like magic!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight snorted, snickered, and burst out laughing. Blueblood glared at her. &quot;I certainly hope you&#039;ve been working on that memory spell of yours, or you&#039;ll be raising the sun again today...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;The Jedi Council will be gratified to know,&quot; the Kaminan geneticist told Obi-Wan Kenobi, &quot;that our production of the new clone army proceeds ahead of schedule. Although we must admit, due to the nature of the... donor subject... the military discipline of the force will be a bit... er... unorthodox.&quot;</p><p class="double">Obi-Wan had been through enough Loops that he&#039;d become quite skilled at feigning the appearance of a person trying hard not to look surprised. When the observation ports opened to reveal the mess room below, however, he found himself quite unable to feign anything. The surprise was just that real- and emphatic.</p><p class="double">The massive mess hall was full of quadrupedal creatures, almost all pink, except for a very small minority of white-bodied, blonde-maned sports. You couldn&#039;t say the room was festooned with balloons and streamers, because that would leave no space for the words, &quot;overloaded,&quot; &quot;overburdened,&quot; &quot;overkill,&quot; and the two word phrase preferred by the part of Obi-Wan&#039;s brain that gibbered in fear at the sight, &quot;game over.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course we had a different donor in mind,&quot; the Kaminan continued, &quot;but Jedi Skywalker was adamant that this was the optimum form for the Council&#039;s needs.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Jedi Skywalker? Jedi <i>Anakin</i> Skywalker?&quot; Kenobi asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I believe so,&quot; the Kaminan nodded. &quot;It&#039;s none of my affair, but I thought it odd that the Council would send such a young man on such a task. But since he knew everything about the project,&quot; the tall, slender amphibian shrugged, &quot;I suppose the Council knows its affairs better than I would.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, Anakin, Anakin,</i> Obi-Wan thought, terror rising in spite of a lifetime of Jedi training from the crèche, <i>what HAVE you done?</i></p><p class="double">Below, the creatures tossed cupcakes at one another and bounced around merrily, shouting, &quot;Fun! Fun! Fun fun! <i>Fun fun! </i><i><b>FUN!!</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.8 (Masterweaver, Bigou)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">‘<i>Well, this is awkward…’</i> quipped Vinyl.</p><p class="double">Octavia sighed. “What is it this time?”</p><p class="double">‘<i>Oh, just Waking Up inside your head.’</i></p><p class="double">“Vinyl, you always wake up inside my head. You&#039;re my imaginary friend!”</p><p class="double">‘<i>Yeah, um… About that…’</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.9 (yannoshka)</p><p class="double">All things considered, Twilight Sparkle did not often loop in as a full blown alicorn. Occasions where she was male were of more frequent occurrence than that. Sister - or in recent looping history mother - loops excepted.</p><p class="double">So, when she awoke encased in forty feet of ice, her first instinct was understandably to free herself as swiftly as possible. Loops where she died at the very beginning were a bad portent for the nature of the following one.</p><p class="double">Thus it happened that it did not dawn onto the alicorn of magic that she in point of fact was an alicorn - aura mane and tail and all - until after she had quite spectacularly shattered her icy confinement and faced the six awe-struck ponies. Three of which had apparently been brawling before her prodigious revelation of herself.</p><p class="double">Before she could even try to ascertain what was going on, she heard a slight shuffle behind herself and felt a magical touch from an Honesty, which besides herself was responded by another magic, a laughter and a loyalty.</p><p class="double">None of the pony loopers cared much for telepathy in general, but it was widely acknowledged and accepted fact that, on occasion, it was a useful channel for communications, especially when there was no one around who could conceivably detect it.</p><p class="double">Thus, hearing her daughter&#039;s mental voice intruding into her thoughts, while unexpected, was firmly considered a nice kind of surprise.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi momma! Girls are device necklaces. We have a plan. This is hearthswarming cave we find ourselves in. Be haughty and hammy, please momma.&quot; Nyx could usually produce much more coherent and well articulated mental conversation, but simple was best when time was nipping at one&#039;s hooves.</p><p class="double">There were very few persons within the multiverse that Twilight Sparkle would do whatever was asked for without a thought, no questions asked. Her little Nyxie was at the very top of that list. So, when the alicorn spoke to the huddled ponies she gave a command performance.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS!&quot;</b> She thundered in Royal Canterlot Voice. <b>&quot;WHO DARES DISTURB MY REST? WHO DARES BRING HATRED AND DISHARMONY TO ME AND MY DAUGHTER? SPEAK NOW YOU FOOLISH FOALS, OR FACE MY FURY!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">The first to snap out of the mix of abject terror and awe in the face of what to them appeared as goddess was the bright yellow pegasus mare. Without missing a beat, she smartly turned, saluted her ebullient superior officer and reported.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir, as your aide, it is my duty to advise you that this is the time to exercise every last scrap of humility and diplomacy you possibly could manage to dredge up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even as the pegasus was speaking the earth pony mare dragged her elderly mentor, looked him straight into the eye, and spoke levelly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now sir, none of your usual antics now, elsewise you will never see another honey-and-oats cookie again. Now go and try to soothe the angry super pony afore she blasts us all to smithereens, aye?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorns on the other hoof, had quite different predicament. Namely the green one in hooded robes was hyperventilating and babbling while her becrowned compatriot was trying to get her attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;OhMyHerdOhMyHerdOhMyHerdShe&#039;sAnAlicornSheMustBe TheMasterWasRightINeedToTellHimINeedToFindOutMore OhMyHerdOhMyHerdShe&#039;sAngryShe&#039;sMadShe&#039;sGoingToAnihilateMe Idon&#039;tWantToGetAnihilatedThereIsSoMuchMoreToLearn OhMyHerdWhatDoWeDoNow...Ack!&quot;</p><p class="double">Platinum finally broke her chief mage out of her fit by a resounding telepathic slap.</p><p class="double">&quot;None of that. You can fall to pieces later. Now feed me cues however you can.&quot; The unicorn princess growled at blinking Clover out of the side of her muzzle before affixing a gracious smile, and took a deep bow before the purple being of immense power.</p><p class="double">&quot;As it please your greatness, I am Platinum, crown princess and in the interim the regent of the unicorn Kingdom. I led the expedition of my people here in attempt to find a safe harbor from the unendurably deteriorating environments of our home, only to find out that these lesser ponies followed us, and brought the blizzards with them!&quot;</p><p class="double">Clover was not called the clever for nothing. Once snapped from her panic attack her mind raced as fast as it ever had in her young life - and being an apprentice to a brilliant, absentminded eccentric who lacked the basic most sense of self preservation trained one to think fast indeed. And if her master&#039;s theories were right, Platinum had just insulted two thirds of the alicorn&#039;s biology. She hurriedly butted in over her mistress in a damage control mission.</p><p class="double">“And by lesser ponies my mistress meant those of lesser education and culture, not disparaging the other tribes of ponies!”</p><p class="double">Diplomat from her cradle, Platinum accepted the alteration in stride and tried to carry on as if Clover’ correction had been exactly what the unicorn princess meant. Unfortunately for her it was not a very big cave, the ones she referred to as &#039;lesser ponies’ were also present, and at least one of them was not about to allow for a precedent of allowing prissy useless unicorns to malign him and his army.</p><p class="double">“Like stormblazes she wasn’t. She meant every zephyr and cumulus word exactly as it came out!” The pegasus stallion bellowed in parade ground shout, his voice surprisingly high.</p><p class="double">His move might have been politically inspired, had he not spoiled the effect by then turning and arrogantly leering at Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Commander Hurricane. Stratus Stratocracy. Who and what are you?”</p><p class="double">Twilight noted with an internal wry smile that Pensee facehooved in exasperation.</p><p class="double">Before Twilight could respond to Hurricane’s insulting behavior the only other stallion present there chided him. In contrast to the former’s clear, high voice, Puddinghead had a brogue so thick you could cut it with a knife.</p><p class="double">“Naw, naw, maw fellah. Where’re yar manners… Er was it marrinades - nevar could remember which’s which - tha’s ‘ardly polite’s what I’ve be’n sayin’ dontcha know. We’re all guests here at mistresses suffer’nce. Tis not p’lite ta be d’mandin an all that. An’ I’d watch that fowl tongue ayours. There be youngin ears ‘ear’bouts, dotcha notice.” The Elderly stallion trotted past Twilight bold as brass, to come face to face with Nyx, who was mostly hidden in the shadows of the cave and her mother&#039;s body, and then took down his enormous hat to reveal a bowl of pudding perfectly balanced at the top of his head. He took it down, pulled a small wooden spoon from the band of the hat, replaced the hat upon his head, and then offered the bowl and spoon to bemused alicorn filly.</p><p class="double">“Hello there youngster. Want some pudin’?” as Nyx readily took the offering from his hooves, he turned back to apparently gobsmacked Twilight and abashedly shuffled his hooves.</p><p class="double">“Sorry I couldn’t offer you any ma’am. I only got enougha fer one.” Then he gave her a Pinky-wide grin and bowed floridly, sweeping off his absurd hat once more.</p><p class="double">“Pecan Puddin’ be my name, though mosta folk jist call me Puddin’ead. Fer my sins, th’ duly elected chanc’ler o’ the earth pony federation.”</p><p class="double">Where Pensee was still holding her head in her hooves, Cookie looked caught in between desire to laugh uproariously and bash her head on the cavern wall. That was the nature of her boss, he’d either charm you utterly, or drive you completely up the wall. Her paralysis of indecisiveness finally broke as Puddinghead handed the bowl of pudding to the angry imposing supper-pony’s foal. She did have to admit that the black little filly looked awfully cute, even if she did have very odd eyes.</p><p class="double">As Puddinghead introduced himself to Twilight, who it must be said had to work hard to maintain her forbidding expression in face of the old stallion’s odd charm, Cookie bashfully approached to the alicorn, and, gaze held firmly to the ground, addressed her.</p><p class="double">“Erm, ma’am. He didn’t mean anything by it. Giving your daughter sweets I mean. And ignoring you while he went about it, of course. He just loves foals is all. And I want to assure you that that pudding is nothing dangerous. That was to be his luncheon.”</p><p class="double">“I’ll shay. Thish shtuff ish top notch.” Nyx mumbled in foalish bliss through a muzzleful of pudding.</p><p class="double">Her mind however conveyed a question to her mother. “Ready to kick it up a notch momma?”</p><p class="double">“I’m thinking going to 2.3 Rarities and 1.64 Trixies*?” was Twilights mental response</p><p class="double">“Hmn, Fine to start, but maybe drop it to 1.61 Trixies, we don&#039;t want to get too overwhelming.”</p><p class="double">Twilight reared up in apparent agitation, and her horn momentarily lit up like a newborn star. A broad ribbon of lilac magic shot up and lassoed around the room (thank you AJ for your tutelage) gathering and disposing each and every non-alicorn pony in the chamber before her in a space of time so small none of them could even draw breath to comment. As the coup de grâce of performance, the ribbon then proceeded to muzzle them down.</p><p class="double">“<b>ENOUGH OF THIS CHARADE!”</b> She boomed magnificently.</p><p class="double">“<b>YOU WISH TO KNOW ME?

HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO DECLARE FOR THINE SELVES AFORE I MET OUT MY JUDGMENT OF YOU?”</b></p><p class="double">Her declaration was met with resounding silence. That is until Nyx wryly pointed that with their mouths magiced shut they could hardly say anything.</p><p class="double">It was hardly unexpected that it was Puddinghead who spoke first as the magic binding dissipated from the muzzles of ensorcelled ponies. His question however…</p><p class="double">“Yar younes didja ‘ear ya right? Onnaya names thingys be Snark, aye?” He asked brightly, apparently oblivious to any minor considerations such as say being in magical grasp of a testy corporeal goddess.</p><p class="double">Caught by surprise by the non-sequitur, Twilight just nodded mutely. Even a mind inured by eons of association with Pinkie Pie apparently was no proper preparation to dealing with this version of Puddinghead.</p><p class="double">The old stallion’s face near split in two as he crowed to his unamused secretary.</p><p class="double">“An’ yer dou’ted me Cookie. I tolja Snark wus real. Whyelse woulda maw fam’ly dedicate generations to ‘unting it if it wusn’t real.”</p><p class="double">Cookie’s voice was desert dry and bone tired as she gave a long suffering sigh and responded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Chancellor, as usual, your logic is proven to be beyond the ken of lesser minds...&quot;</p><p class="double">Puddinghead did not seem to notice anything amiss with the manner his assistant and protégé delivered her response as he turned his face back to Twilight and, with an irrepressible grin, added.</p><p class="double">“Though even I gotta admit I nevar expected snark to be a d’vine pony. I thought ittd beh a small bird or sum kinda roddant to be ‘onest ‘bout thigs.”</p><p class="double">Twilight just stared at the unruly statespony for a good, long, and decidedly unamused moment, before she shook her head in true exasperation. Then, ever so slowly her penetrating gaze moved from one face of her captives to the next. Another flash of magic neatly divided the group in two, with the three leaders left in front of her, and their subordinates unceremoniously dumped near Nyx. As she next spoke to the leaders her voice was that of a being who had left mortality a long, long way ago. She was particularly proud of that voice, it took her several loops to truly perfect.</p><p class="double">“My little ponies are meant to live and love and work together in harmony. That you disgraces managed not only to perpetuate divisionism but active hatred and animosity to the point that you called down windigoes upon those in your charge is beyond the pale. I judge you unfit to lead a herd of drawn sheep much less living ponies. Much as I would wish otherwise, as I had hoped for in the past, I see now that I cannot leave my little ponies to their own devices. You are simply not yet ready…”</p><p class="double">As Twilight was berating the three leaders, Nyx did not waste time on pleasantries. As the founders were dropped and her mother drew attention, she used her magic to shove the appropriate device housing the appropriate one of her friends onto the appropriate mare.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Now, it should be mentioned an interesting phenomenon. The three founders, as a point of fact were not loopers. They were souls voluntarily bound to magical technology that were further soul bound to actual loopers. Therefore, the actual memories were contained, not by the souls of the founders themselves, but by the combination of Cutie Mark Crusaders and the intelligent devices housing said souls. This allowed for the admittedly rare and frankly odd cases when the CMC took residences in the devices for the loop to… facilitate the awakening of the souls of founders to the loop by putting them into contact with the devices. Put in simpler terms it took souls of the founders plus the physical devices plus the souls of cutie mark crusaders in direct contact for the founders to be, as it were, loop active.</p><p class="double">Pensee blinked as her in-loop memories integrated with her ‘looping’ ones. Then she scowled.</p><p class="double">“Was the charade truly necessary Scootaloo?” She mentally communicated to her mistress.</p><p class="double">“Sure it was. We’re gonna play this loop without touching either the elements or the tree of harmony. We get to deal with all the treats as erstraz superheroes slash divine entities.” Came the unrepentant reply.</p><p class="double">Despite herself the yellow Pegasus grinned.</p><p class="double">“I suppose we’re finally going to attempt to feed me, Cookie and Clover alicorn energy to prevent our aging?” She queried in honest interest.</p><p class="double">“... For self governance. I shall have to reassume the title of Queen of Equestria.” Twilight finished her diatribe.</p><p class="double">“Umn, what and where is this Equestria?” Platinum asked in bewilderment. She could just feel the events spiraling more and more out of control, and it unsettled her more than she would be ready to admit to any save Clover.</p><p class="double">Twilight graced her with cold smile. It was a good cold smile. She won sea cucumber over tufa in cold smiles, evil sneers and maleficent grins versus Discord with that one. Pinkie of course cleaned the house.</p><p class="double">“Why, right here my dear. This, is my domain, and this will become the land of all ponies as it was meant to be.” And just to drive the point home, Twilight’s horn lit up like a localized supernova.</p><p class="double">As everyone recovered from the blinding light of the spell, they found themselves, not in the crude cave they had been just a moment ago, but in grand throne hall, made of marble and gold and silver. Before them, the purple alicorn was no longer standing, but lying on the grand throne raised upon a dais. And just beside her grand throne, was another, filly sized one obviously intended for her daughter.</p><p class="double">It was an ostentatious piece of magic, but universally agreed amongst the loopers, as a most fun one to use, if for no other reason than to observe the reactions of the nonlooper.</p><p class="double">“Are the Heralds ready Nyx?” Twilight continued in imperious manner, finally drawing the attention of the three leaders of pony nations back to the little alicorn and their subordinates.</p><p class="double">The Founders were a sight to behold indeed, clad in resplendent suits of armor, they hovered in midair just beyond Nyx and their eyes shone with eldritch fire.</p><p class="double">“As ready as I could make them momma,” Nyx replied with a carefree grin, and military grade innocent childish cheer.</p><p class="double">“Then step forth my Heralds, and accept thy tasks,” commanded Twilight.</p><p class="double">True to his nature, Hurricane decided then and there that he was not going to take any more cumulus.</p><p class="double">The poor, poor, misguided egomaniac…</p><p class="double">“Lieutenant what is the meaning of this treachery, Must I remind you that desertion and defection are serious crimes.” He hissed at Pensee, before turning back to contentedly impassive goddess on her stately throne.</p><p class="double">“And, I don’t know who do you think you are, but…” he started to below, but before he could gather any steam, he found himself muzzle to muzzle with a very surprised windigo, some forty miles above equistran.</p><p class="double">“Well, now that that is taken care of…” Noticing the stink-eye both Nyx and Pensee were giving her, Twilight huffily amended what she was starting to say. “Oh, what do you take me for. I placed a bubble of protection on him that should last long enough for him to learn his lesson before it brings him down unharmed.”</p><p class="double">With that paltry little thing out of the way she continued upon the prior agenda, and sent the three founders to herald the immediate - and in the case of Stratus Stratocracy forceful - change of governance and coincidentally, could you three be dears and kick the windigoes back to mesopause, we wouldn’t want former commander to get lonely, now would we?</p><p class="double">Platinum was huddled in a miserable mess right where she stood before the almighty purple pony casually banished that insufferable lout Hurricane, without even a blink of her horn. That lasted until the madpony next to her cheerfully called the alicorn’s attention back to them.</p><p class="double">“So yer takin’ tha’ buncha silly buggars offen m’ back? G’ luck witem m’lady and thenkeevermach o’ muchness. I’ll be righta glad t’ get backta wurkin’ with lil ones. Much m’re reasonable an’ sweet themper’d foals be as camper’d with m’ fine bucha coucilers, doncha know.” He turned jauntily and left the throne room tu utter, flabbergasted silence.</p><p class="double">And then, just as the three remaining ponies were starting to recover, he stuck his head back in and shyly asked “If’n sompony could see it clear t’ lead me outa this yore castle on accounta, me ‘avin’ no iddea ‘ow to navigate it, twould be muchly ‘preciated.”</p><p class="double">“Actually good master Pudding, it occurs to me that now that I am taking control of a nation, I will need a master of the royal nursery, and you seem to have already established a nice rapport with my daughter. Besides that, what with all the ravages caused by conflict and the ensuing windigos there are bound to be orphans of all three pony kinds that will need care for. Would you be interested? I warn you now it will be a hard and often thankless job…”</p><p class="double">“Sahy no more, yer Maj. I’m yar stali’n, fer that, an’ no mistakin’ it. When willa ye be free to discuss plans and resources?” Despite his jolly, oftentimes cheerfully crossing into full blown ridiculous, demeanor, it should be noted that Pecan Pudding was by no means, intentions nor indications a fool. There was no mistaking the steely seriousness of his voice nor expression as he accepted the offer without a blink.</p><p class="double">Twilight graciously nodded, and with great dignity proclaimed, “As soon as my heralds return with a preliminary census, and I establish some basic governance and infrastructure, you shall have first call on my time. For the moment though, Nyx can take you to the kitchens, since... ”</p><p class="double">She never even got the opportunity to finish her sentence, before her daughter popped up next to the old goofball, picked him up in her magic and zoomed out of the throne chamber.</p><p class="double">“...bwuh?” Twilight muttered in annoyance and mindspoke to Nyx. “What was that about?”</p><p class="double">“I’m building a reputation for childish exuberance, general irreverence and mischievous spirit. I plan to have a lot of fun this loop. By the way, at what rate do I have to age? I’m thinking three hundred to one.” Came the prompt mental reply from her daughter.</p><p class="double">Twilight had to fight down a bemused smile. “I’ll be taking the request under consideration. I accept bribes in the form of books, large amounts of chocolate and cuddles.” She bantered back, and then turned her attention to the gibbering mess of the former leader of the unicorns.</p><p class="double">“Oh, do stop that, it is undignified. I neither torture, eat, experiment upon nor do other unspeakable things to my little ponies, and whatever I might think about your attitudes so far, you are one of my little ponies. You have my word as an alicorn.”</p><p class="double">“But… But… Hurricane…”</p><p class="double">“..Is taking a slightly uncomfortable and rather unpleasant time-out, but is otherwise quite safe.”</p><p class="double">As she observed Platinum pulling herself together, she considered the unicorn carefully.</p><p class="double">“Now, what shall I do with you? The stallions are easy to deal with, but you - you are versed in intrigue and plotting, and as unbalanced as you are now, I am quite certain it will not take you too much time to start pursuing your own agenda. To be quite blunt, I neither have time nor inclination to deal with that - so here is an offer, and you won’t get a better one, I can assure you of that. I leave you and your descendants, direct line only mind you, the title of princes and princesses, grant you housing, staff and stipend, and in return you pledge yourself and your progeny in service to myself, my family, and the well being of Equestria.”</p><p class="double">Platinum did not need to consider the offer for overlong. She was quite shrewd enough to understand that while the alicorn’s promise protected her from horrific fates, it said nothing about any number of very unpleasant fates that she could think of offhoof.</p><p class="double">“By the stream and the mountain, horn and spell, the sun and the moon, I Platinum, of a sound mind and under no coercion, do pledge allegiance of myself and any foal of my bloodline, to your majesty and your kindred, and also to that of the nation of Equestria.”</p><p class="double">*Though perhaps a bit unkind Rarity and Trixie came to be neigh-universal scale for measuring drama and hammines respectively amongst their fellow Equestrian loopers. It said something about the nature of loops and loopers that those two were hardly the only ones used as a measurement, nor were they the most unkind usages. It is best left unsaid what Pinkie Pie scale was used for. Suffice to say, it only went from -1 to 1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.10 (85.1 Continued) (Bigou)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The nightmarish idea that Pinkie Pie might be an imaginary pony made real not only scared said pink being, but also Twilight, the narrator, and even the author himself.</p><p class="double">Strangely, Fluttershy wasn&#039;t. In fact, when it was proved that Pinkie never was anypony&#039;s imaginary friend, she was strongly disappointed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.11 (AnyonymousAsk: highly edited by fractalman)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord was resting inside a sofa, while Twilight and Celestia looked at him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you sure this is going to be a good idea, Doctor Twilight?&quot; Asked Discord, feigning nervousness.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dah... the root of all your evil is inside you...we need to take it out&quot; Say Twilight with a false Russian accent.</p><p class="double">Twilight then took a pocket watch and swung it in front of Discord.</p><p class="double">&quot;Follow the watch, Mr. Discord... just relax, and listen to my voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, you are relaxed. Let your mind return to the past...to the deep past...now, where are you, Discord?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In Canterlot Garden. I&#039;m a statue.&quot; answered Discord.</p><p class="double">There are many misconceptions about hypnosis. For starters, Legitimate hypnosis subjects do not speak in a monotone; instead they sound quite normal, if a bit relaxed. Discord and Twilight knew this, and knew that Celestia knew this, so Discord very much did NOT answer in a monotone voice. Deadpan snark, on the other hand/hoof/claw/paw...</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay...further back...that&#039;s it...now where are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still a statue.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Further back, please. &quot;</p><p class="double">There was a pause.</p><p class="double">&quot;WAAAAAH! I miss my mommy!&quot; whined Discord.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oops!&quot; giggled Twilight. &quot;I guess he went too far back. Ah well, I guess you can raise him up from square one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aunn&#039;ie! Aunn&#039;ie Sunny take care of me!&quot; slobbered Discord as he hugged a rather nervous Celestia.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">120.12 (fractalman)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow as she stepped outside. The ground was slightly hardened sugar, most houses were made of gingerbread, and her tree was a candy cane.</p><p class="double">She double-checked her loop memories; no, it was not discord&#039;s fault this time.</p><p class="double">As she stared at the rim of the world, she chuckled: Equestria was literally a sugarbowl.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I hear she flosses her teeth!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She lives in the Everfree!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It ain&#039;t natural there. The ground is made of nasty dirt! Ya can&#039;t eat it!&quot; Applejack, farmer of candy apples, pointed out.</p><p class="double">&quot;The trees are...broccoli!&quot; whimpered Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, that would be the bushes. And broccoli is edible in small quantities, though I have to admit it is most distasteful.&quot; quipped rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, the trees are made of toothpicks!&quot; pointed out Rainbow Dash.</p><p class="double">&quot;The rain...is water! Pure water&quot; whispered Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Most of the ponies in the room shivered in fear at that.</p><p class="double">Twilight sparkle was quite bemused...until she remembered that, this loop, ponies were literally made of candy, rendering water hazardous to their health.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Droplet fell, and struck the sugary ground. For a second, nothing obvious happened. Then it bubbled up, a black welt on the white land…</p><p class="double">Twilight stared in horror for a second that felt like a minute. If that droplet had hit a pony…</p><p class="double">Another droplet fell. Twilight snapped out of her stupor, cloned herself with kage bunshin, and started swarming the planet to find and wallop Dischem, the spirit of chaos and chemistry. Other clones went to retrieve the Skittles of Sugar, which would be most helpful for cleaning up the sulfuric acid clouds.</p><p class="double">No messing around with this version of Dischem, oh no, Twilight was going to take him out with overwhelming firepower before he got somepony killed.</p><p class="double">She was, however, looking forward to firing the Skittles of Sugar.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight approached Bon Bon. &quot;Excuse me, do changelings eat blood or love?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon Bon stared. &quot;What&#039;s blood?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The sugar water in ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon Bon shrugged. &quot;They drink the sugar water from ponies. Uh, why did you want to know?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed. &quot;You&#039;re leaving licorice crumbs everywhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon Bon eeped, while Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m just going to grab some water from the Everfree and mix it with some ground. If it turns out that pony sugar-water has some nutrient you need, I&#039;m sure I can synthesize that as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon Bon sagged in relief. &quot;Oh, you would? Oh, it&#039;s official, Twilight Sparkle is best pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AHEM!&quot;</p><p class="double">Both ponies turned to see Lyra tapping her hoof. &quot;Best pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bon Bon blushed. &quot;Er, second best?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;I&#039;ll go get started on that sugar water.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile, in Lyra&#039;s mindscape:</p><p class="double">&quot;LET US OUT!&quot; yelled human Lyra.</p><p class="double">&quot;This sticky concoction is not good for my circuitry.&quot; deadpanned Robot Lyra.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shoo-bee-STILL STUCK!&quot; was all that Seapony Lyra felt needed to be said.</p><p class="double">&quot;How did Sweet Roll take over the entire mindscape, anyways? This is the first time she&#039;s even been sapient, isn&#039;t it?&quot; asked Unicorn Lyra.</p><p class="double">Sweet Roll Lyra merely grinned like an idiot. &quot;This is so much fun!

One sophont, one vote.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Celestia shook her head and got up to leave. “Well, that sort of...” She trailed off. “What vote counting system are we using?”</p><p class="double">“First past the post by constituency.” Luna held up a big pile of paper.</p><p class="double">“Good.” Celestia took her seat again. “Anything else and I&#039;d say the whole thing was pointless, with that many Changelings...”</p><p class="double">Cadence trotted in. “We got a set of ballots from the badlands!”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Shining added, following his wife. “Problem is, that&#039;s about fourteen constituencies each of which has two dragons and a minotaur in. They&#039;ve all gone Loyalty.”</p><p class="double">“Please tell me that Honesty, at least, is running a fair campaign...” Celestia begged.</p><p class="double">“Gilda said she was going campaigning, if that helps,” Luna reported. “I do not know what-”</p><p class="double">There was a soft <i>flumph</i> sound, and all four of them found themselves buried in paper.</p><p class="double">“Pfeh,” Shining muttered, pulling a slip of paper out of his mouth. “...and she seems to have taken over the Griffin Empire and told them all to vote for Honesty.”</p><p class="double">“Is that legal?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">Cadence replied by putting a very large book on the paper-drifts. “This is the rule book.”</p><p class="double">“Author O.B.I.H Discord.

Time to get counting.”</p><p class="double">She opened the first box, which promptly exploded.</p><p class="double">When the flash-blindness wore off and the Royal Best Element Election Commission could see once more, they beheld a room full of a truly vast amount of ashes and dust.</p><p class="double">And, sitting neatly on the floor where the table had been, three slips of paper.</p><p class="double"><b>Twilight Sparkle </b>– Magic</p><p class="double"><b>Trixie Lulamoon</b> – Magic</p><p class="double"><b>Applebloom</b> – Magic</p><p class="double">“...sister,” Luna said, after several seconds of silence. “Did the Elements of Magic just rig the election to explode?”</p><p class="double">“It seems so,” Celestia replied calmly. “Right, that was an interesting waste of a few days. If you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;m going to work out exactly what kind of letter I wish to send Twilight, Trixie and Applebloom over this.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">121.2 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, Lyra, what is it you wanted to show me?&quot; Twilight asked, joining her friend on the park bench.</p><p class="double">&quot;First, put these on.&quot; Lyra hoofed her a pair of glasses. &quot;Glasses of True Seeing; had &#039;em made so I could do a quick and easy check to find out if Bonnie&#039;s a changeling in a given loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Putting on the glasses, Twilight looked out across the park at Lyra&#039;s direction. Twilight looked out at all the <i>changelings</i> in the park, disguised as ponies. They even had little changeling fillies and colts. In a change from the norm, they all seemed to have the coloration and even cutie marks of the ponies they looked like.</p><p class="double">&quot;One of those loops, eh?&quot; Turning to her friend, Twilight was presented with a mint green changeling. After a quick check of her own leg, she returned Lyra&#039;s glasses. &quot;Well, I know I&#039;m not a changeling this loop at least. Ideas on how far this goes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... Here&#039;s the thing, Twi, you and Bon Bon are the only two <i>actual</i> ponies in Ponyville.&quot; Lyra scratched her head. &quot;Other than that, about half of Baltimare. Not many of us beyond that, though. At least, not connected to our hivemind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Even the girls, eh? Well, the Elements didn&#039;t have an issue with them, so I don&#039;t think this&#039;ll be a problem.&quot; Twilight gave her friend a playful shove. &quot;And how has the hivemind been dealing with your hivemind? Getting along?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re kinda in charge.&quot; Lyra replied in an exhausted tone. &quot;The Swarm follows the eldest, and as Loopers I, me, myself, and the other me, are the oldest and wisest.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra smiled cheerfully at Twilight. &quot;On the bright side though, we&#039;re growing a few mindless drones for the rest of me to control. Give it half a year, and each of me&#039;ll have a body, if only via remote control.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm. Well, unless you wanna do something special, I think I&#039;ll just take it easy this loop, go baseline. As leader of the changelings, do you have any ideas on what, if anything, you want to do for the wedding?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I did have a couple ideas...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight!&quot; Cadance cried at the mare that had just appeared in her prison. Her very nice prison, which was furnished like an upscale hotel.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance?&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;If you wanted to talk in private, you could have said so. Where are we?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I didn&#039;t bring you here! I&#039;ve been kidnapped!&quot; Before Twilight could reply, the face of the pony Cadance had privately started calling Princess Pink (after her own distaste of being called that) appeared in the room&#039;s large mirror.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello again! It is I, once more, speaking to you! In my voice! Well, in her voice really, but who&#039;s counting?&quot; Not-Cadance cleared her throat. &quot;Moving on. I do hope you don&#039;t mind sharing your prison, Cadance, but this one was getting just a bit too close to my plans. Do not bother with your magic, the room&#039;s insulated, there is no escape, blah blah blah. Cadance can fill you in on the whole spiel. I made sure the minibar was topped off while she slept, and there&#039;s munchies in the fridge. Ta-ta!&quot; With that, the mirror faded back to glass.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meanwhile, in a Canterlot Police interview room, a certain mare was trying to convince somepony she was telling the truth.</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s when you claim the entire town turned into bug-ponies?&quot; The officer asked, trying to keep his headache in check.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! Trixie does not know which spell caused it, but she saw them all! And they know!&quot; The blue mare shifted uncomfortably, looking behind her, before lowering her voice. &quot;They know. They&#039;ve been following Trixie ever since. She sees them, in crowds at the market, sitting in passing trains, in the audience at her shows.&quot; Trixie let her head rest on the table, covering it with her hooves. &quot;They know, and they know Trixie knows that they know. Trixie had to tell somepony, had to let somepony know before they got to her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Lulamoon, hearing your story, I think you may have accidentally made yourself able to see through changeling disguises.&quot; The officer steepled his hooves. &quot;Most likely, they&#039;re not after you personally, and you&#039;re just seeing them going about their business.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie jerked her head up to look at him. &quot;But! But!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie fell silent at the officer&#039;s beckoning. &quot;We will investigate, see if there&#039;s a possible stalking charge to be made. But if the changelings in Ponyville, or any connected to them, aren&#039;t stalking you, then there&#039;s little we can do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But, horrible shapeshifting bug-ponies?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are registered Equestrian citizens, if of a very little known species.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; There was a pause. &quot;Trixie would like to apologize for her unintended racism.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I still can&#039;t believe that the minibar was the key to breaking out.&quot; Cadance whispered, as they snuck along the castle&#039;s servant corridors.</p><p class="double">&quot;Enough booze makes problems go away, just ask any drunkard.&quot; Twilight snarked, before waving her into a side room. &quot;Okay, I know how to turn this around. I&#039;ve learned a few things in my time in Ponyville.&quot; She smiled at Cadance. &quot;Trust me, this is gonna work, and be pretty funny too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Setting about looking through the boxes in the room, Twilight kept talking. &quot;Start off by drinking that bottle we saved from the bar, it&#039;ll help. The first thing we need to find now, is a Hawaiian shirt...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lyra was smiling, disguised as Cadance at the altar. <i>Come on, Twilight, I&#039;d rather not get married today.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Well you&#039;re the one that lost!</i> Lyra-Lyra told herself, from where she stood as a bridesmaid.</p><p class="double"><i>You know, there might be a law against marrying yourself. Just a thought.</i> The other two Lyras, were magically hidden from sight, filming the event from multiple angles.</p><p class="double"><i>Aha, There&#039;s Twilight&#039;s signal! It begins!</i> All the Lyras started taking glances at the door in anticipation.</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia, oblivious for the moment, continued with her role in the wedding. &quot;Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you– &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stop!&quot; Twilight Sparkle burst through the doors.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh! Why does she have to be so possessive of her brother?&quot; Lyra-Cadance played her character, turning on the waterworks. &quot;Why does she have to ruin my special day?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;MUCKLE DAMRED CHANGINS &#039;AIR EH NAMBLIES BE KEEPIN&#039; ME BONNIE WE SHINY?!&quot; The words that would live in Canterlot infamy, for the rest of the loop at least, came from the angry mare that had just entered the room. She wore an orange Hawaiian shirt, a pair of aviator sunglasses, and had Philomena perched on her shoulder. The phoenix was also on fire.</p><p class="double">Right on cue, the Cadance at the altar started screaming bloody murder, before slugging Shining Armor to disrupt the shield around the city, and making for the horizon.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Many months later, at Lyra&#039;s request Twilight had gone for her baseline ascension. As she put it, since the entire town was Loop Aware, they felt most comfortable going with tried and true methods.</p><p class="double">That said, noling expected what happened when the Elements blasted her. Twilight and her friends stood outside the library, staring down a dumbstruck Princess Celestia. Literally, in Twilight&#039;s case, as the newborn changeling queen had been lifted up by the four celebrating Lyras.</p><p class="double">&quot;New boss, not the leader! New boss, not the leader! New boss, not the leader!&quot; They were chanting, as the entire town was coming together around them. By the time Celestia got her wits about her, a block party was rapidly being assembled around her, under the direction of a familiar pink changeling.</p><p class="double">As she looked at all the undisguised changelings around her, Celestia felt somepony pat her on the back. &quot;Relax, Princess.&quot; Bon Bon told her. &quot;They ain&#039;t bad folk, once you get used to them.&quot; The candymaker sighed. &quot;Guess I&#039;m back to being the only pony in Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">Looking back to the party, Celestia let out a laugh. &quot;And I thought Discord was joking about this!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">121.3 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luke Skywalker Awoke next to the malfunctioning vaporator on the south ridge.

She struggled to retain her position as she channeled the Horse, enveloping the trooper in a shimmering blue radiance that lent him speed as well as helping to deflect blaster shots.</p><p class="double">Luke watched the pack of running Stormtroopers retreat into the distance, to the tune of weapons fire and diving merchants. &quot;Gee, Old Ben,&quot; he snarked. &quot;How did you pull that off?&quot;</p><p class="double">Obi-Wan struggled to retain a stoic expression as his charge started up the landspeeder. &quot;The Horse is often effective against the weak-minded, although this effectiveness may come at the... utter expense of stealth.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">Darth Vader struggled to keep the X-wing in his sights. &quot;The Horse is strong with this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luke would have shrugged if he had any room in the cockpit for the gesture.

He was close to the exhaust tunnel that headed directly to the massive space station&#039;s core. That said, due to the massive amounts of laser fire from the emplacements and the several squadrons of Imperial Star Fighters that were chasing him and him alone, the chance of success looked to be nil.</p><p class="double">However, he quickly remembered the words his deceased master Obi-Wan Kenobi had told him during his early days of Jedi training...</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Use The Horse Luke, use The Horse!&quot;</i> And so... he did use The Horse.

No matter how much time passes, how old you get, how much you think you know, there is always something new to learn. No matter how old and wise you become, you will never know everything. And sometimes, you are just so used to how things are, that you stop questioning things. But that&#039;s wrong, because there is always something else which can be done to improve things. There may be not such thing as perfection, but that is a stupid excuse to not try to do better! Case in point, I got two mommies, and I have been ignoring one of them. Could you please tell Luna that I am sorry and I want to expend time with her the next time she is awake?</p><p class="double">Your Faithful Niece, Nyx.</p><p class="double">PS: Here are pictures of a loop where non awake Luna and Twilight got married and adopted me.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nyx Moonlight Sparkle!

Underneath the aggravation of being woken up far too early, she was intrigued. Mainly because it was the day after the Poison Joke incident had resolved itself (since this Loop she appeared to be alone, she&#039;d decided to go for a baseline run), and she had no idea what could be causing the knocking.</p><p class="double">Slowly, carefully, she made her way downstairs, and to the door. Cautiously, expecting anything, she opened the front door.</p><p class="double">After a few seconds adjusting to the light, she looked around. Nopony was there. Then she looked down, and saw an envelope sitting on the doorstep. She opened it, and examining the contents.

Upon awakening, however, she couldn&#039;t help but have a double take since Pinkie was bowing and worshiping an oversized sweet roll, along with shrines for sweet rolls throughout Ponyville. She suddenly got the feeling Discord was awake and had set this up just to mess with her, &quot;Pinkie, what are you doing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped, &quot;Don&#039;t you remember, Twilight?

She had done a lot of things to redeem Nightmare Moon, almost all of them were crazy in some way, shape or form, but this she couldn&#039;t picture, unless Pinkie or Derpy transformed the moon into a sweet roll and dropped it on Nightmare. Pinkie failed to notice Twilight&#039;s blank stare and continued, &quot;Celestia had a stain glass window of the event commissioned and even elevated their position to guardians of Equestria.

Maybe cover his house in moon pies, or somethin&#039;-wait.&quot;</p><p class="double">Oswald turned around, and then just stared.</p><p class="double">There, standing in front of him was a navy blue horse...thing with wings and a horn. Her mane, Oswald noted, was apparently made of stars, and she bore a symbol of the moon on her flank.</p><p class="double">Also, she was radiating magic on a level that Oswald had never seen before, excluding deities.</p><p class="double">The alicorn and the rabbit just stared at each other for a few seconds. &quot;Please tell me you know what Looping means.&quot; Oswald finally stammered.</p><p class="double">The alicorn smiled. &quot;Indeed. My name is Princess Luna&quot;</p><p class="double">Oswald nearly collapsed in relief. &quot;Oh, thank the stars. I&#039;m Oswald. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna tilted her head confusedly. &quot;I don&#039;t believe I have heard of you before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not many people have. I&#039;ve only just started Looping recently. Just after the Crash.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna nodded. &quot;Yes, this makes sense. We have some Loopers from that time period. Anyway, welcome to Equestria. Or at least, Equestria&#039;s moon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Oswald grinned. &quot;Aw, neato! Mickey told me about this place after I started Looping!&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the Loop memories hit. Luna waited politely while Oswald got them sorted out.

Luna?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why the blazes are we <i>married?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna looked at Oswald in confusion, before her Loop memories came in. &quot;Ah. it seems that the Magic Kingdom is an actual country in Equestria this Loop, and you and Mickey got hitched to me and Tia as a political move.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mickey&#039;s here?

That&#039;s right!&quot;</p><p class="double">As Mickey finally burst out laughing, and Celestia couldn&#039;t make up her mind whether to attack the members of Team Nightmare or check on her husband, Twilight sighed, and brought a hoof to her face. At least this Loop would be interesting.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.2 (TangleKat)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tony Woke Up running down a hill. Normally this wouldn&#039;t have been a problem, since he often Woke Up during the track meet. Normally, however, he didn&#039;t have four hooves. And normally he didn&#039;t have a grand piano chasing him. &quot;Why did it have to be a piano!? Why couldn&#039;t it have been a toaster?&quot; he cried. “Toasters are small. Toasters are safe. And why is it a random piano?!”</p><p class="double">Spotting an alleyway ahead of him, he darted into the alcove just as the piano was about to run him over. &quot;That was way too close.&quot; Glancing out the alleyway, he could see that the instrument had crashed at the bottom of the hill and was being looked after by several townsfolk. He could also see a few tired ponies nearby; clearly he hadn&#039;t been the only one in danger. Several of them were glaring angrily at a cross-eyed mare at the top of the hill.</p><p class="double">&quot;Definitely not the best way to begin a loop.&quot; he muttered to himself. &quot;Probably about as bad as the one where I looped in as Korg.&quot; He paused for a moment, thinking it over. &quot;No, the Korg loop was worse. But not a good start either way.&quot; Now that he had a moment to breathe, Tony checked his loop memories. &quot;Okay, my name is Solar Shard and I moved to Ponyville a month ago to study the animals of the Everfree Forest. Not a bad profession, really. I think Strag lives in town, so I should probably check in with him first thing. No memory of Edyn though; she probably looped in elsewhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tony stepped out of the alleyway and<i> into a dark pavilion. Nearby he could see Edyn and Strag were prepared for battle (both ponies as well, though Edyn looked like a unicorn and Strag had wings) and around the three Final Dreamers the townsfolk were talking nervously. He could hear them murmuring about someone named Princess Celestia having gone missing. &quot;Do either of you know what&#039;s going on?&quot; he asked.</p><p class="double">It was Edyn who answered. &quot;Long ago, two royal sisters ruled Equestria together. The older sister brought day and helped crops to grow and flourish, while the younger sister brought the night and kept dark forces from invading the Dreams of the three tribes. In a distant land, an evil sorcerer grew hungry for power; he turned his eyes to Equestria, but was driven away by the two sisters. The sorcerer would not give up, however. He entered the Dreams of ponies and tried to corrupt them, in order to turn them into his loyal servants. This time he was defeated by the younger sister, and so the sorcerer hatched a devious plan. Slowly and subtly, he sent parts of his dark presence into the Dreams of the younger sister. He convinced her that the ponies shunned her and her night, corrupting her into a Shadow of her former self. On the night before the longest day, she transformed into a wicked mare of darkness and did battle with the elder sister. The younger was defeated and sealed into the moon, while the sorcerer was imprisoned in the deepest pits of Tartarus. It is said that a thousand years after her banishment, the younger sister will return and seek to free her dark master. Guess what today is?”</i></p><p class="double">Tony gasped and stumbled; his visions always came at the least opportune times and were usually info-dumps. From what it sounded like, Agram had turned one of Equestria&#039;s rulers into the equivalent of a Shadow Magi and was trying (once again) to escape his seal. And having an evil night-goddess opposing you didn&#039;t sound like a good thing either way. &quot;Now I really have to find the others.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“<i>The first thing one should always do upon Waking Up is to check one&#039;s Loop Memories. They will have crucial information on whatever Variant or Fused Loop you find yourself in.”</i></p><p class="double">This mantra had become a part of Edyn&#039;s routine whenever she began a new Loop. She couldn&#039;t remember when she had begun to recite it, but it often helped to calm her down in a new place - especially if that place happened to be dangerous. Thus she began to take stock of herself and her environment: she seemed to be named Moonbud, she was a Unicorn and was the personal apprentice of the local ruler. As for location, she was in a public garden located in the capital city of Canterlot. A book was lying open in front of her, and she seemed to recall that she had been reading it before Awakening. In addition, her Unawake self had been rather frantic for some reason.</p><p class="double">“<i>The second thing one should do is to test all available magical frequencies with a Ping. It will inform you of any other Loopers who are currently Awake.”</i> Having allies was always useful; even though Tony and Strag always Awoke with her, it could get a little boring sometimes with just the three of them. A quick pulse did the trick, with two responses echoing back - one seemed much fainter than the other. It reminded her of how Tony used to Ping, before they had learned that all three Final Dreamers were Co-Anchors. Since he Woke Up on Earth, his had always been much fainter than Strag’s.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;That&#039;s odd.&quot;</i> She thought to herself. <i>&quot;I always heard that Equestria had one of the most numerous Loop populations; I guess we got a quiet Loop. And since I’m certain that I’ve Replaced the local Anchor, I guess I won’t be able to debate magical theory with her.</i></p><p class="double">Now that she&#039;d gotten the important things dealt with, she turned her attention to the book in front of her. It appeared to be some sort of creation myth about two sisters and an evil sorcerer - she was willing to bet that Agram had had a hand in things - and how the younger sister had been locked away. What was most disturbing was the threat of the lunar Diarch&#039;s return. &quot;An ancient legend about a fallen princess returning? That could partially explain why I feel so nervous… Not counting the fact that she&#039;s probably a Shadow Magi (or whatever the equivalent here is), I&#039;ll have to do a little bit of research on the topic in order to get a better grasp of the situation. According to the Loop Memories, I should have a good reference book in my room.&quot;</p><p class="double">She rose to her feet and reached out for the book with telekinesis; she was pleased to find that her new Unicorn magic responded readily and in much the same manner. As she was packing the book away, she heard the sound of approaching hooves behind her. She turned around and found a trio of ponies all chatting as they ascended a near-by path. One of them noticed her and waved.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Moondbud! We&#039;re going to Moondancer&#039;s birthday party; do you want to come?&quot;</p><p class="double">Edyn smiled. &quot;As much as I&#039;d love to, I&#039;m afraid that I just found a really intriguing legend. If I don&#039;t follow up on it now, I&#039;ll probably be awake all night studying it. Give her my regards though, will you?&quot; The other ponies agreed, and the two groups spilt ways.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Naroomi-turned-Unicorn was able to find her chambers easily enough; Loop memories were useful for small things like that. Upon entering the room, she was greeted by her assistant for this loop - Spike the Baby Hyren. The dragon-turned Dream Creature held a colorfully wrapped package - most likely for Moondancer, given his crush on the Unicorn. She almost felt bad asking for his help, and had to remind herself that he could always attend the party later. &quot;Spike, would you please give me a hand for the moment?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike glanced at the package sadly before placing it safely on a table. &quot;Sure Moonbud; what can I do for you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Edyn was already busy examining the shelves for anything that might provide a clue. &quot;Could you please help me find that old compendium of (<i>let’s see, what was it? Oh yeah!</i>) Myths, Legends and Old Mare&#039;s Tales? I was pretty sure we had one here, and I want to use it for something.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike floated up to one of the upper shelves, and spotted the book easily. &quot;It&#039;s over here!&quot;</p><p class="double">Edyn glanced up from the shelf she&#039;d been on - a particular book on mixing magical and herbal remedies had caught her eye - and took the book from the Baby Hyren with her telekinesis. &quot;Thank you, Spike. Would you mind waiting a few moments longer? I want to check on something, and I may need you to send a message to the Princess. You should be able to head to Moondancer&#039;s party after that though.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Dream Creature was only too willing to oblige. &quot;It’s not a problem! I like helping you, Moonbud!&quot;</p><p class="double">Edyn opened the book and skimmed the table of contents. &quot;Let&#039;s see now... Mare in the Moon, page 228.&quot; She turned the pages to the appropriate section and glanced over the pages until she found the passage she was looking for. &quot;The Mare in the Moon - also known as Shadow Moon - is believed to be a spirit of darkness that once served an Ancient sorcerer. She will bring about nighttime eternal to weaken the bonds of her master&#039;s cage, releasing his evil back into the world. Some scholars believe that it is possible to banish this dark spirit permanently using a magical artifact called the Book of the Ancients. However, the location of the Book is unknown and many claim that the Book itself does not exist.&quot;</p><p class="double">Edyn glanced over the passage again. So far, what she had found did appear to conform to Agram&#039;s plan - even the eternal night brought to mind the many Shadow Geysers Agram had set out to use in the Baseline. Though her loop memories were still nagging at the back of her mind... Oh! The thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration was in a few short days! That explained the sense of urgency she had been feeling all morning. &quot;Spike, please prepare to take a message.&quot; The young Hyren snapped to attention and fetched both quill and parchment.</p><p class="double">&quot;To my honored teacher; I have recently found an old legend claiming that your sister - tainted with dark magic - will return during the Summer Sun Celebration. It is my request then that I act as overseer for the preparations in order to ensure that there are adequate facilities to provide aid in the off-chance that something does happen. Your gracious student, Moonbud.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike breathed a green flame over the scroll (probably a dragon leftover, since Hyrens were incapable of such magic) and it vanished in a puff of smoke. Edyn turned back to the shelf and was about to pick up the book on herbal remedies when a burp and flash of heat caught her attention.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow! I didn&#039;t expect her reaction to be that fast!&quot; the Baby Hyren said. &quot;Should I read it?&quot; Edyn nodded and he unfurled the scroll, coughed twice and began to read.</p><p class="double">&quot;My dearest student; I am touched by your concern for what you have found. I am well aware of the legend, and emergency preparations have be accounted for. However, I do feel that perhaps you are spending too much time in Canterlot. I will grant your request to oversee the festivities in order to provide a change of pace; all I ask in return is that you take this opportunity to relax and to not worry about what may or may not be. Take a vacation and make some friends! Signed, Celestia, Diarch of the Day.&quot;</p><p class="double">A vacation? With Agram plotting and scheming behind the scenes? It was almost enough to make Edyn scream. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.3 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zecora watched the warship limp away with minor misgivings. While these &#039;Blue Rogues&#039; seemed more akin to Luffy and his Straw Hats in their conduct, they had still stolen every single thing of value from the Valuan ship save personal items and just enough fuel for them to reach safe harbor.</p><p class="double">What had made it awkward was the Valuan soldiers swapping increasingly exaggerated tales of how Zecora had saved their Sub-Commander from certain death (at the hands of their much hated Commander, no less) and went on to defeat the ferocious Antonio single-handed. It had nearly come to blows when the pirates made it clear that Zecora was also coming with them.</p><p class="double">But even the more devoted of Zecora&#039;s new fans had to admit that they were the ones who&#039;d attacked Zecora without provocation, sinking her ship in the process, and so off they went.</p><p class="double">As for Zecora, she and her new companion Cupil were heading to the pirates&#039; base. The two youths who had chased off Alfonso seemed to have been assigned as her minders...but there was something about the boy that made Zecora suspicious...not the least of which was when she introduced the two to Cupil, Vyse and Aika were immediately on the receiving end of a somewhat squishy hug.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Vyse watched the blasted and ruined Pirate Isle disappear into the distance with a familiar clench in his belly. He <i>really</i> didn&#039;t like doing this, in fact it went against every fiber of his being not to at least warn his dad or the rest of the crew about what was going to happen, but...he&#039;d learned the <i>hard</i> way that having Pirate Isle evacuate ahead of the attack, raising their defense or putting up any resistance, or even just the act of taking Fina with them to Shrine Isle that day ended BADLY. It resulted in Galacian shelling the island until it broke apart, planting Valua&#039;s flag on the biggest remaining piece that still floated, and yet <i>another</i> loop where Vyse was responsible for the horrible death of his family. At least with the original course of events everyone lived.</p><p class="double">Aika still didn&#039;t approve, even having seen the result firsthand. How Fina had forgiven him was mind-boggling...though the fact that Ramirez was now looping might&#039;ve had something to do with it. Even if the man&#039;s devotion to Galacian had lasted through the loops and he would never dare gainsay that monster&#039;s order to open fire on innocent <i>women and children</i> - </p><p class="double">His thoughts derailed spectacularly as Vyse, opening the door to their ship&#039;s little cabin, found himself face to face with an extremely unamused Zecora. And no matter what Aika might claim later, Vyse certainly did not scream like a little girl, flail his arms, or fall into an undignified heap on the deck.</p><p class="double">&quot;Once you have recovered from your place on the floor,&quot; Zecora said dryly, &quot;Perhaps you can explain your deception from before?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, won&#039;t Galacian notice if you&#039;re, y&#039;know, not his prisoner anymore?&quot; Aika pointed out as the three of them prepared to set sail again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aika, I must say you are quite mistaken,&quot; Zecora answered with a sly smile, &quot;For indeed, as their prisoner I was taken.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and that is why I remain a loyal servant of Lord Galacian,&quot; Ramirez concluded.</p><p class="double">He hesitated for a moment, before adding &quot;You were right, it was a relief to finally share my thoughts. Vyse is a strong warrior but he hates my lord far too much to ever accept my reasons.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora - or rather, a Kage Bunshin of her - nodded solemnly. Ramirez returned the nod as he straightened his uniform.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sadly, I must return to my duties. Unfortunately as you are replacing my sister, I must ask that you stay in this cell for the time being. Vyse typically arranges her rescue after breaking into the Coliseum.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Zecora clone glanced around her cell - which was actually a luxurious stateroom - and smiled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do not worry for my sake. But as for your duties, should you not arrive late?&quot;</p><p class="double">Hopefully her real self would follow up on this budding friendship, the Zecora clone thought as Ramirez took his leave. He was a very interesting young man. Perhaps they would get a chance to speak more before she was dispelled. That would be...nice. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.4 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lyra fidgeted in the town hall, waving off the various concerned ponies who wondered what was wrong. All four of them were full of nervous energy, except for Sweet Roll, who was full of honey glaze. It wasn&#039;t that she knew that Nightmare Moon was about to put in an appearance. She might not be the strongest Looper, but she thought she&#039;d be able to take a baseline alicorn in a pinch, especially with Seapony at the helm.</p><p class="double">She tossed a glance towards the crimson stallion watching the balcony expectantly. His black mane had been pulled back into a topknot, showing off the pair of curved horns twisting out from his forehead and causing no small amount of gawking from the other unicorns. His right forehoof was encased in what appeared to be a cylinder of elaborately carved stone the same color as his coat.</p><p class="double">Hellcolt, he called himself. When she&#039;d told him that Equestria was a sanctuary he&#039;d just grunted and said &quot;we&#039;ll see.&quot;</p><p class="double">She wasn&#039;t offended. A lot of Loopers were incredulous the first time they heard the offer. But usually one of the Bearers was on hoof to enforce things. If not the first six then Trixie or Gilda or, larch, the crusaders in a pinch. At the moment, Cheerilee was the oldest local Awake. And, while the teacher could be exceptionally kick-flank when she wanted to be, there was an irreplaceable comfort to having friendship powered artillery backing you up. Just in case.</p><p class="double">&quot;What have you done with the Princess?!&quot; The Mayor called out, shaking Lyra from her reverie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Her hour has passed,&quot; Nightmare Moon spoke, unhurried. &quot;The day has ended and night is upon you. A thousand years ago I sought to rule over this world, but in my exile I have learned humility in the service of my master, who lies sleeping upon the edge of eternity. This world will be <i>his</i> as it was in ages past. Darkness is his purpose and his blood and his prison, and through me it shall be his freedom also.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she&#039;d spoken, Nightmare&#039;s mane had billowed out above her, filling the ceiling with abyssal darkness and a million points of dying light. One in particular began to grow larger, or closer, a misshapen seven pointed star. Lyra shivered. This was new, and she wasn&#039;t sure if she was feeling up to <i>new</i> just then. Around her ponies stood, transfixed in horror.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seven is their number, seven in heaven and seven in the earth, but they are also one, one in name and one in purpose,&quot; the usurper continued, eyes aglow with eldritch light. &quot;They are the wind of destruction, for mighty children are they, and their time is come again. Behold, the Great Dragon, Ogdru Jahad! Returned from the abyss by my hoof and my-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And though evil winds may blow and chaos fill the sky, I am sheltered &#039;neath your bough and thy roots hold firm...&quot; Cheerilee&#039;s voice rose in counterpoint as the pages of a small book rippled in an unseen wind before her. As they&#039;d worked out over a hoof full of vampony and demonic variants, prayers to trees worked just fine while the Tree of Harmony was in place.</p><p class="double">Across the room, Vinyl swept a hoof through the air. The prayer&#039;s words, backed by a melody blaring from her speakers, were compressed into a physical force and hurled at the chanting goddess.</p><p class="double">&quot;Naught but sound and fury, signifying <i>nothing!</i>&quot; She snarled as the attack forced her back a step. &quot;Your precious tree holds no more power here than your Princess. Neither holds the faintest glimmer of might next to that which-&quot;</p><p class="double">She was cut off once more as Lyra dropped her disguise, falling to the floor in her seapony form. The released illusion allowed her to devote her full power to a conjured whip of water. The liquid weapon struck with a sickening <i>crack</i> and Lyra&#039;s eyes widened as one of Nightmare Moon&#039;s wings went limp. She&#039;d only put so much force behind the attack because this version of Nightmare seemed so much stronger than the usual, she hadn&#039;t wanted to hurt her <i>that</i> badly!</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>ENOUGH!</b>&quot; Nightmare Moon roared, ignoring her injury as she reared up and launched lightning from the abyssal chasm her mane had become. Where the bolts landed the room erupted in black fire, burning high and hot. The cracks of thunder had finally rattled the non-Loopers from their stupor and a stampede began for the doors. &quot;Surrender. This is the end of your era. From this moment on there is no joy, no courage, no <i>hope</i>. Only the endless night and terror of-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lady,&quot; Hellcolt said as he strode through the flame without fear or discomfort. &quot;You talk too much.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anung Un Rama,&quot; she breathed. Above, the star had resolved itself into a massive amber crystal. Larger than cities, than continents, than <i>worlds</i>, it loomed overhead, waiting. &quot;Your place here was foretold, Right Hoof of Doom. As I am the Gate, so you are the Key. Together we will rule over the last bleak days of this realm and watch the destruction of all from on-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah yeah, I&#039;ve heard it all before,&quot; he grumbled, more annoyed than anything. He turned in Lyra&#039;s direction. &quot;You guys wanna handle the portal? I got this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, sure,&quot; Lyra answered uncertainly before perking up. &quot;Could you go easy on her? She&#039;s pretty nice once she comes down off the crazy.&quot;</p><p class="double">He regarded her for a long moment before offering a curt nod. &quot;Yeah. Alright.&quot; With that, he bunched up his rear legs before springing at the balcony and cracking his stone hoof across Nightmare Moon&#039;s jaw.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright,&quot; Lyra said, encasing herself in a sphere of water and floating over to the only other ponies still on the ground floor. &quot;Ideas?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You are blinded by my sister&#039;s <b>lies</b>, Anu-&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Ain&#039;t my name,&quot;</i> The conversation, punctuated by heavy blows, drifted down from above.</p><p class="double">&quot;Feels weird,&quot; Vinyl commented, horn glowing as she scanned the aetheric vibrations around the hole.</p><p class="double">&quot;Agreed,&quot; Cheerilee nodded, waving a heavily modified tricorder. &quot;It&#039;s less a gateway-&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You cannot fight your fate, child. Your destiny has been laid since long before your birth.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Shut <b>up</b>, lady!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;-And more a foreign set of physics imposing themselves on the world,&quot; she finished.</p><p class="double">~Oh, oh, tag in!~ Miscellaneous enthused from within Lyra, and Seapony obligingly slid aside. The other personality rummaged through their Pocket for a moment before stabbing a six foot steel post covered in blinking lights and loose wires into the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s that?&quot; Vinyl asked.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You are a <b>fool</b> if you think you can-&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;I told you to <b>shut up</b>, lady!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I call them Regularity Rods, they&#039;re kinda the opposite of Peppermint Pylons,&quot; Lyra explained. &quot;They enforce local physics and make them harder to override. Real useful for limiting damage during mad science, saved me a trip to Eiken more than once.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three looked up again and saw an edge of Nightmare Moon&#039;s mane bulging up and away from the rod.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seems effective,&quot; Cheerilee agreed. &quot;If we can set up more of them we may be able to <i>pinch</i> it shut.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;On it!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You <b>will</b> open the way, if not today, then-&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Lady, you and me, we got a <b>problem!</b>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>&quot;Again, we&#039;re <i>really</i> sorry about that,&quot; Lyra told their guest after things had settled down. &quot;We can usually manage on our own.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it, kid,&quot; Hellcolt answered.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, she&#039;s right,&quot; Cheerilee insisted. &quot;Equestria is a sanctuary Loop, and we take that seriously. You shouldn&#039;t have had to get involved.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m serious too,&quot; he assured them. &quot;Admins tell me my universe got whammied by a bunch of the Outer Gods before the Loops started, and well... Lets just say that I got troubles, an&#039; they tend to follow me. Ain&#039;t your fault most of the big guys shrug off anything that didn&#039;t help make &#039;em.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trust me, just getting someone out from under the Dragon is miracle enough for me.&quot; Luna had come out of it looking much worse for wear than usual, having been held in the tender mercies of dark gods for a thousand years, but she <i>had</i> come out of it. &quot;And that thing with the prayer was clever. Probably would have worked if she weren&#039;t getting backed up by squid-face. Now...&quot; He lit up a cigar and clamped it in his teeth. &quot;Anything else I should know about? Imprisoned devils, sealed monsters, ancient civilizations, Fae courts, stuff like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">The trio of locals exchanged glances. &quot;That... Yeah, that might come up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I usually work with a team, and I like having a fish-man at my back, so...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, and vamponies are a thing this Loop,&quot; Vinyl added, peeling back her lips to show off a set of fangs. &quot;Thought you&#039;d wanna know.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.5 (Scorntex) </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">One otherwise calm and quiet day, the doors to Big Mac&#039;s bars swung open, and a pony dragged themselves in. Slowly, they made their way to the bar, and collapsed before reaching it.</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh just watched this with concern. He didn&#039;t recognise the pony, one of a dark blue colour, thin and tall build, and greying hair, but they looked like they were going to be requiring his services all the same.</p><p class="double">Slowly, the pony lifted his head, revealing a set of eyebrows best labelled as &quot;ferocious&quot;, brows that would instill unease in the eldest of dragons. Or they would have if their owner didn&#039;t look so weary.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi&quot; the pony said, casually, as if he had not just dragged themselves into a room.</p><p class="double">&quot;Morning&quot; Big Macintosh said, carefully. He couldn&#039;t help but notice the distinctly Scottish accent the pony had. That combined with everything else led him to one conclusion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Doctor?&quot;</p><p class="double">The man nodded, gloomily.</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh eyed the man carefully. He hadn&#039;t as much experience with the Time Lord as some of his other Loopers, but he could still guess that whatever had caused him to be this despondent had to have been something truly horrific.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened?&quot; he asked. The Doctor paused for a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;s them ponies. Wanted to turn everyone else into more ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Without a single word, and without any appearance of actually having moved at all, Big Macintosh had reached under the bar, pulled out a large tankard, and placed it next to the Doctor. He stared at it, then to Big Macintosh.</p><p class="double">&quot;That was fast&quot; he noted, apparently for lack of anything else to say.</p><p class="double">&quot;Brain bleach&quot; Big Macintosh replied, &quot;standard procedure with Bureau Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">The man glowered at the drink, and Big Macintosh was impressed. The way he was glowering, the liquid would have been well within its rights to just combust there and then.</p><p class="double">&quot;Worse than just a Bureau&quot; he said, &quot;it-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope&quot; Big Macintosh cut in, before pointing to an adjacent sign hanging above the bar. There, drawn in friendly letters was the phrase &quot;first rule of Bureau Loops: Do not talk about Bureau Loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">Just underneath it, someone else had thoughtfully added &quot;Until Very Drunk.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Doctor just nodded at that. &quot;Right.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the man stared cautiously at his drink, Big Macintosh set off to find Miss Sparkle, and anyone else who happened to be Awake that Loop. He had the feeling they would be needed. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.6 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Mac and Berry, having just finished setup of the bar for the new loop, looked up in surprise as the door to the bar slammed open and the front half of a silver draconequus poked through.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank oak, you&#039;re both Awake!&quot; Silver exclaimed, &quot;I need some kind of brain bleach that can also replenish chakra! Do you have anything like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can whip up something quick,&quot; Berry said, already rummaging through the bar&#039;s supplies, &quot;Had a bad loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, but it&#039;s not for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver proved her point by sliding the rest of the way into the room, revealing that she was carrying a pony on her tail. She dumped her passenger on a bar stool, where he proceeded to slouch against the counter while covering his face with both forelegs. The grumbling complaint at the rough treatment proved that the pony wasn&#039;t unconscious, but by the sound of it he might&#039;ve been happier that way.</p><p class="double">Mac spotted the scarecrow cutie mark on the pony&#039;s flank and frowned.</p><p class="double">&quot;We can give Twilight a ring, have her come in from Canterlot early,&quot; Mac offered.</p><p class="double">Kakashi made another grumble. Then, after Silver nudged him, repeated &quot;<i>M&#039;fine</i>&quot; at a slightly higher and surlier volume.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not THAT serious, but...we just finished a rough loop in Kakashi&#039;s baseline,&quot; Silver clarified, &quot;It started off pretty normal, except we had a stealth Anchor and we were the only ones Awake. Stuck with baseline powers and no pockets too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac nodded, encouraging Silver to continue.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...we were twins, and the preawake us had been working together for our whole lives, so we decided to finagle the Hokage into assigning us as dual sensei for Team Seven. I mostly was curious about Sakura&#039;s genjutsu potential, Kakashi basically turned Sasuke into a trainee hunter-nin, and Naruto bounced around between the two of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry slid a glass of something green and softly fizzing over to Kakashi, who grabbed it without looking and drank. He perked up immediately, though even after Kakashi removed his hooves from his face, he didn&#039;t open his eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Our universe is going through these &#039;expansion&#039; things nowadays,&quot; Kakashi said, continuing the tale, &quot;Irregular ones, and the other loopers in our branch derail things pretty fast.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So we decided that as long as we were there, we might as well see how things were <i>supposed</i> to go,&quot; Silver added, &quot;And it got WEIRD around the time that the Infinite Tsukiyomi activated. Especially with the Ten Tails changing forms and blowing up everything like we were in a Dragon Ball fused loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not to mention Naruto never bothered to mention who &#039;Tobi&#039; was ahead of time,&quot; Kakashi growled, &quot;I could have done without <i>that</i> surprise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The loop crashed right after Kaguya was defeated though. Not sure why.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Must&#039;ve been one tough fight if you&#039;re still tired after the reset,&quot; Berry said, &quot;Silver, you need a pick-me-up too?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Err, that&#039;s not really...&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver trailed off, looking over to Kakashi. Kakashi sensed what she wanted, sighed, and reluctantly opened both eyes. Mac and Berry were treated to the sight of a matched set of Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan for four whole seconds before Kakashi slammed his hooves over his face and slumped back down onto the counter in renewed exhaustion.</p><p class="double">Much like his original Sharingan, Kakashi couldn&#039;t figure out how turn them off. At all. Obito was probably laughing at him from the afterlife.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Really</i> hope this is temporary...&quot; Kakashi groaned out loud.</p><p class="double">Silver patted his shoulder sympathetically.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll just go ahead and make you a double,&quot; Berry said, already heading back to her tools. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.7 (fractalman)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Rainbow</i> Dash stuck her tongue out-or tried to. It was kind of hard to move when you were a pile of <i>rocks.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.8 (Novusordonmundi)</p><p class="double"><i>You&#039;re... here...</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m trapped... And I&#039;m lonely... So very lonely...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Won&#039;t you join me?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you poor creature! Have you been trapped up here in Pokemon Tower all this time? Of course I&#039;ll join you for a while!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy rummaged through her subspace pocket for a little bit, before finally pulling out a stasis container with what looked to be preserved brains (ethically sourced, of course). She looked over to her companion, a decaying corpse of a man sticking halfway out of the floor. It just grunted and groaned a little bit, but wasn&#039;t actually going after Fluttershy, or pulling out it&#039;s Pokemon to battle. </p><p class="double">Fluttershy had been told by Loopers about this possible variant, where this zombie would challenge them to a Pokemon Battle at the top of the Pokemon Tower in Lavender Town, and pulling them into the ground and eating them if he won. All they knew of him was he went by &quot;Buried Alive&quot;, or &quot;Buryman&quot; for short. For the most part, he wasn&#039;t enough of a challenge to warrant much attention from most Loopers. And to her knowledge, nobody had tried to have a picnic with him.</p><p class="double">But there was a first time for everything. Fluttershy took the brains out of the stasis jar, and put it on a plate in front of Buryman. The corpse looked at it for a second, before taking it with his free hand, a grin on it&#039;s face.</p><p class="double"><i>Finally... Fresh meat...</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Was all Red could manage, his brain unable to come up with any better statement to being told about Fluttershy&#039;s adventure.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I just showed him a little bit of kindness.&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;Being buried alive must have been horrible! It was the least I could do for the poor thing...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that is a first for dealing with him.&quot; Red allowed, before a thought crossed his mind. &quot;Hey, if we&#039;re trying for kindness, want to come with us over to Cinnabar Island? I know a certain something that could use a bit of kindness. Just... don&#039;t try to catch him, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">Flutershy&#039;s face brightened &quot;I&#039;d love to. But if you don&#039;t mind, do we have time to grab a shovel and head back to the Tower? I kind of promised the man I&#039;d dig him out...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Sure, why not?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.9 (The Cyan Recluse)</p><p class="double">“Hurry up Twilight! You’ve got to put a stop to this!” An Awake Spike demanded, practically pulling Twilight Sparkle along behind him as he stomped towards Sweet Apple Acres.</p><p class="double">“Spike! I’d have better luck ‘putting a stop to this’ if you took a moment to explain what ‘this’ is!” The purple furred unicorn reproached her number one assistant / son /brother / personal postal service.</p><p class="double">Spike didn’t bother slowing down as he replied.</p><p class="double">“Look, you know how Big Mac started installing one of Pinkie’s mini Candy Cane Pylons in the bar to deal with the unexpected ‘problems’ variant or fused loops sometimes cause?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, so? It seems like a good idea to me.” Twilight replied, raising an eyebrow. </p><p class="double">“Well, Pinkie and Trixie are abusing it to have a drinking contest!” Spike grumbled, clearly unhappy with the situation. Twilight just blinked in confusion.</p><p class="double">“A drinking contest? Is that all? We have drinking contests all the time Spike! I don’t see what has you so worked up.” She huffed as they neared the entrance to Mac’s bar.</p><p class="double">Truthfully, both Pinkie Pie and Trixie could be a handful when sober and on their own. Pinkie had a tendency to casually violate the law of physics. And Trixie tended to violate laws regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction. If the two of them were drinking and egging each other on... Well, that could lead to the sort of event where reaching ‘minimum safe distance’ required leaving the planet’s orbit. </p><p class="double">For non-looping Equestrians such an event would be terrifying beyond their ability to comprehend. For individuals such as Spike and herself, it would be a rather hum-drum Tuesday. In short, something that needed to be handled, but certainly nothing URGENT. </p><p class="double">Which made the way Spike was rushing her so peculiar.</p><p class="double">“It’s not the contest that has me so riled up!” Spike groused. “It’s WHAT they’re drinking!” Before Twilight could reply, he pushed the door to Mac’s bar open and gestured inside.</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced through the door and noted that Mac’s bar was more or less in its normal configuration for this early in the loop. The scorch marks on the floor and walls were a new touch however. (Major property damage usually didn’t occur quite THIS soon.) Some of the tables were also looking a bit... melted. Then there was the fact that Mac was hunkered down behind the bar, wearing a clear plastic blast shield over his face, and looking ready to duck.</p><p class="double">In front of the bar stood a grinning Pinkie Pie, with a smile on her face and a glass in her hand. A heavily shielded and enspelled glass full of a simmering, smouldering liquid that had most certainly NOT been designed for equine consumption.</p><p class="double">“Bottoms up!” The pink party pony giggled before downing her beverage in one shot.</p><p class="double">“PINKIE!” Twilight’s eyes went wide in alarm as she rushed forward to try to stop her friend. She was far, far too late of course.</p><p class="double">“Ooooh… I feel tingly….” Pinkie began to wobble from side to side after a few moments, before holding still and emitting an enormous, echoing BELCH! Twilight blinked and slowed her headlong dash towards her friend.</p><p class="double">“Ooooh! That feels MUCH better…” The element of laughter began to grin. </p><p class="double">Then she exploded.</p><p class="double">In video game terms, it would be referred to as Ludicrous Gibs. Bits of fluffy pink fur and meat went flying in all directions, trailing pinkish colored ‘blood.’ After a few seconds the giblets came to rest on the ground, forming little pools of blood.</p><p class="double">Then the pieces exploded too. </p><p class="double">Twilight’s pupils shrunk down to pinpricks as she stared around the room at the (relatively few) remains of one of her best friends. A few puddles of pink goo were all that remained, sizzling as they started to eat into the floor. </p><p class="double">Before she could fully wrap her brain around recent events, where was an electronic ‘whoop-whoop-whooooop’ sound… And suddenly an intact, perfectly hale and hearty Pinkie Pie was standing in the middle of the room again, flashing in and out of existence for a few seconds before fully solidifying with a grin on her face.</p><p class="double">“That was AWESOME!” Pinkie bounced up and down in excitement. “I really love those fizzy drinks!” </p><p class="double">“Trixie believes the proper word is ‘fissile.’ Hello Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight managed to pick her jaw up the floor and turned her head to spot Trixie, who had apparently been standing in the opposite corner of the room. Twilight had completely missed the show-mare’s presence in her rush to save her friend. The blue furred pony smiled and waved as she approached Pinkie.</p><p class="double">“Well, I don’t care what it’s called, it’s awesome! So, your turn now?” Pinkie grinned in excitement.</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned and face-hoofed. “Pinkie’s Candy Cane Pylon. Of course. I’m an idiot.” She sighed and glanced around the bar as Pinkie and Trixie began mixing another one of Berry Punch’s ‘Dragon-Specials.’ The damage to the scenery was surprisingly superficial. Most of the blast marks looked identical and seemed almost painted on. </p><p class="double">“Well, at least I won’t have to douse the place with an entire lake. Again.” She muttered to herself. Giving her head a shake she walked over to Big Mac, who was cautiously standing back up from behind the bar.</p><p class="double">“Please tell me that you didn’t think this was a good idea.” She asked plaintively.</p><p class="double">“Eeenope.” </p><p class="double">“You try to stop them?”</p><p class="double">“Eeeyup.”</p><p class="double">“And how well did that work out?”</p><p class="double">Big Macintosh just give her a long suffering look and sighed.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that’s what I thought.” Twilight sighed herself. “We really have GOT to get that mare a HEALTHY hobby for loops when Chrysalis isn’t Awake.”</p><p class="double">“Eeeyup.”</p><p class="double">By now Spike had entered the bar proper, and arrived at Twilight’s side.</p><p class="double">“Don’t just stand there Twilight, get them to cut it out already!” He demanded.</p><p class="double">“Spike, while I agree that this behavior isn’t exactly... healthy... They’re not actually harming anyone.” She paused, then shrugged. “Well, not harming anyone PERMANENTLY. So long as they fix Mac’s bar when they’re done, I don’t see a reason to stop them.” </p><p class="double">“Not harming anyone my tail!” Spike crossed his arms and eyed the other two mares angrily. “They’re going through the bar’s stock like Celestia through a cake factory! Do you have any idea how hard it is to get some of the ingredients for those drinks? Red mercury doesn’t grow on trees you know! At this rate there won’t be any left for us dragons!” </p><p class="double">Twilight just blinked. “What?” </p><p class="double">But Spike was paying her no mind, instead stomping over to Pinkie and Trixie, who had just finished (carefully) pouring another cocktail into an enchanted glass. Which was already starting to dissolve.</p><p class="double">“Alright you two, you’ve had your fun! Now cut it out!” He waved his arms about in frustration. “Go have some cider or something and leave the good stuff for those of us who can’t get drunk off of alcohol! I want to have something left to drink after a Bureau loop too you know!”</p><p class="double">Twilight face hoofed again. Sometimes she envied humans. Pinching the bridge of your nose was a surprisingly effective way to relieve stress. Difficult to do when you lacked hands though. And a nose.</p><p class="double">“It is WAY too early in the loop for this.”</p><p class="double">Big Mac patted her on the shoulder consolingly. “E’Yup.”</p><p class="double">Then he used that hoof to pull her down behind the bar at the sound of Trixie’s voice.</p><p class="double">“Cheers!” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.10 (fractalman)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie bounced in through the closed door of the treebrary. &quot;Hi Twilight! I&#039;ve got a surprise for you! Come outside and see!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged, placed her bookmark, and complied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared, turned around, and was blocked by Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember the chocolate syrup swimming pool that randomly showed up? Well you never even tried to swim in it, so I thought, &#039;how can I change this so that Twilight can enjoy it&#039;, and then I remembered that you really really like mint, so I filled a swimming pool with mint jello!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, that&#039;s <i>mint</i>?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded.</p><p class="double">Twilight turned back towards the mint jello swimming pool, grinned, clapped, and squeed like a filly, then jumped in with a running start. She took three bites before she realized something was wrong. Horribly, horribly, wrong.</p><p class="double">&quot;EEEEEUGH! Pinky! What in Yggdrasil possessed you to add chlorine to mint jello!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s easy! Trixie said it would make the jello jell faster, and it did!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;UGG! When I get my hooves on her...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.2 continued (TangleKat)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">My Little Magi – Part 2</p><p class="double">Strag was convinced that Yggdrasil had to be a troll in some capacity or another. It was the only explanation for all of the odd situations that he seemed to Awaken in. Case in point: he was an Underneathian. He was familiar with the earth, with having a tunnel over his head and solid stone beneath his boots. Thus it was logical (and he had assumed) that he would enter the Equestria Loops as an Earth Pony.</p><p class="double">He had instead Looped in as a Pegasus. He was no stranger to flight; he didn’t at all mind visiting the cloud-lands of Arderial nor did he have issue with Magining the bird-like Epik to aid him when need be. No, it was the sheer oddity of Looping in as something completely foreign that confused him. At least the whole Pegasi-stand-on-clouds thing wasn’t out of the ordinary for a Moonlander. It was a fairly useful thing to know since he was currently sitting on a cloud above town.</p><p class="double">He shook his head and resolved to worry about odd Loop behavior later. Right now it was time to check his Loop Memories.</p><p class="double">First – his Equestrian name was designated as Nightfall. Probably due to his duties as a Shadow Stalker, but one could never be too sure. Especially a person with his heritage. Second – He was a part of the local weather team. His duties were primarily to observe the current conditions and to ensure that nothing unexpected happened. And third – he seemed to be a fairly athletic pony. In his baseline he had been a strong contender in the various coliseum battles, so it was only fair that it had carried over somehow.</p><p class="double">Just as Strag finished this examination, he felt Edyn pinging from far away. There was no need for him to reply, since she would already know that he was Awake. What did interest him were the responses. One was faint and likely indicative of someone on another planet or some such, while the other was very strong. In fact, it was strong enough to have come from directly below him. Best to check it out and introduce himself.</p><p class="double">If he could find a way to actually fly first – being stuck on a cloud was problematic.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Edyn stared out the window at the mountains, and was immensely relieved when she saw Ponyville emerge from between them. The small town was nestled between a thick forest and the sprawling plains beyond. “I’m glad we’re almost there; this trip has been entirely too long.” She turned to Spike, who had fallen asleep to the train’s gentle rocking. “Time to wake up; we’ve almost arrived in Ponyville.”</p><p class="double">The Baby Hyren yawned and stretched like a cat before turning to her. “What did you say? I was having the nicest dream…”</p><p class="double">Edyn giggled. “I said that we’re almost there. I wouldn’t want you to sleep through our arrival, would I?”</p><p class="double">Spike’s face flushed bright blue, and he scratched his chin with a claw. “No, I guess that would be kinda bad. Do you want me to go over the list of tasks now?”</p><p class="double">Edyn tapped her chin with a hoof. “Yeah, that would probably be a good idea. What do we have lined up?” She got off of her seat and looked up at the baggage rack, eyes searching for the saddlebags she’d packed before leaving. Spotting it nearby, her horn flared to life with magic and she pulled out the scroll sticking out of one corner. Spike flew up and grabbed it, eagerly unrolling it.</p><p class="double">“Okay, first things first – we’ll have to visit Applejack of Sweet Apple Acres and the proprietors of Sugarcube Corner. They’re going to be doing the catering.”</p><p class="double">Edyn nodded, both memorizing the agenda and listening intently for any sign of her fellow Magi.</p><p class="double">“Next is Town Hall; a unicorn by the name of Rarity is supposed to be in charge of the decorations.”</p><p class="double">Edyn smiled at that; the Looping Spike and Rarity’s wedding was legendary among Loopers. Although she had only heard of it, she thought that what the two had managed to accomplish was both incredible and heart-warming. Shaking the thought from her head, she turned her attention back to her assistant.</p><p class="double">“After that we have to check on the Weather Patrol; a Pegasus named Nightfall is supposed to be watching the skies.”</p><p class="double">The Naroomi’s attention was piqued by that; wasn’t Rainbow Dash usually in charge of weather? The possibility of it being one of her friends was very high. “Actually Spike, can we do that one first? I don’t want to be worrying about the condition of the skies during everything else.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. “Sure thing, Moonbud. I guess it really doesn’t matter what order we do them in, huh?” Spike coughed once for effect and returned to the scroll. “The last one on the list is music. Apparently an Earth Pony named Solar Shard has volunteered to handle it, with an animal-based choir.”</p><p class="double">Edyn had to refrain from clapping her hooves. That one was definitely Tony; of the three of them, his skill with Dream Creatures was the strongest. That left Strag as Nightfall. Her face fell a little as she wondered what he felt of the name he’d been given by this Loop. And certainly as she wondered how he felt about being a Pegasus.</p><p class="double">As Spike rolled up the scroll and returned it to the saddlebag, she felt the train slow and noted that they were currently pulling into Ponyville Station. Lighting her magic once more, she pulled her belongings onto her back and felt the Baby Hyren land just behind her neck. “Ready for this, Spike?” He nodded his affirmative, and together the two of them set out to see what the Loop had in store.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.11</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three armies prepared to face each other, under the supervision of Professor Quirrell, who was bald and didn&#039;t wear a turban this loop.</p><p class="double">Dragon Army had a simple insignia: a patch of fire. This was generally agreed to be a bad sign.</p><p class="double">Chaos Legion had a hand poised to snap. This was universally agreed to be a bad sign.</p><p class="double">Team Happy had three balloons, which freaked out eldritch entities throughout Yggdrasil.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Quirrell rubbed his head, headache rising. &quot;Harry, Draco, Pinkie...you three are hereby forbidden from participating in all future battles.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three loopers grinned sheepishly as they glanced at the battlefield, which was littered with glowing green craters and flying streamer monsters. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.12 (Filraen)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">One of the things which was common knowledge to all ponies in general and Sound Mind in particular was whenever Princess Celestia needed to meet somepony she&#039;d do it in the Royal Hall, as if it was a single-pony Day Court...</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Scratch that, there&#039;s two Princesses now.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Apparently with the recent incident of the Summer Sun Celebration in Ponyville there&#039;s was a second Princess, Princess Luna, younger sister of Princess Celestia, even if nopony had known of her attending any official events or holding a Night Court yet.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Now I&#039;m just diverting my own thoughts, I must be more nervous than I thought.&#039;</i> Anyway, the point was it was unheard of having Princess Celestia requesting anypony&#039;s presence to her private quarters, unless she&#039;d need a stallion for... <i>&#039;Hold that thought! Obviously she wouldn&#039;t have send one of her guard to make such a pompous request in my psychologist clinic if she were just looking for a stallion... right?&#039;</i></p><p class="double">With that thought in mind Sound Mind had the doors opened to Princess Celestia&#039;s bedroom. The place was huge and beautiful decorated with day and night motifs on the walls and bed, but he didn&#039;t have much time to admire it. Princess Celestia and a unicorn, which Sound Mind recognized as the Princess&#039; personal student, were at a table, their worried expressions thankfully sobering his previous thoughts. Steeling himself he went to speak with the two ponies.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After bows given, introductions were interchanged and any Royal Guard dismissed Princess Celestia spoke to the stallion. &quot;What do you know about the Summer Sun Celebration two days ago?&quot;</p><p class="double">The question threw Sound Mind a bit off (probably to shake him from his nervousness, his own mind provided) enough to not to measure his answer &quot;Not much, Princess. I only know that night lasted considerably longer than usual and the rumours of a new Princess, by the name of Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia nodded. &quot;Both things are true, even if that isn&#039;t precise on everything which happened that night. I had to wait for a thousand years for my sister Luna to return,&quot; Princess Celestia&#039;s voice took a sad note. &quot;However, in her return there were complications. Have you heard the tale of the Mare in the Moon?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sound Mind blinked, &quot;that old&#039;s mare&#039;s tale about the two sisters which raised... and imprisoned in the moon...&quot; his eyes widened in surprise as realization hit him. &quot;They were you and Princess Luna?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Ignoring the obvious outburst Princess Celestia answered. &quot;Yes, though at the time my sister was corrupted by a dark force and took the form of Nightmare Moon.&quot; Nightmare Night&#039;s patron? &quot;When we fought I couldn&#039;t heal her myself, and she ended sealed in her moon, still as Nightmare Moon. And she was in that form when she returned, a thousand years later, still corrupted.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t thank my faithful student and her friends enough for bringing Luna back, healed,&quot; Princess Celestia said while smiling to the unicorn by her side, &quot;but their victory wasn&#039;t without casualties. Blinded by the corruption, Nightmare Moon managed to bring one of the ponies who confronted her to madness before being defeated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sound Mind, I&#039;m in need of your services as psychologist. Please heal this pony, both for her own sake and Luna&#039;s: I don&#039;t want to burden my sister even more with the reminder of her shattering the sanity of one of my little ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">If somepony were to ask Sound Mind&#039;s thoughts at this moment, he&#039;d comment on how the powerlessness expression on Princess Celestia&#039;s face goes against the natural order of things. She... she was Princess Celestia herself!</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Diverting thoughts detected, correct course ASAP.&#039;</i> With that Sound Mind took a long sigh, trying to gather his own thoughts. Eventually he spoke: &quot;Is she in Ponyville? I have many other patients and I would make a disservice to them if I couldn&#039;t make to their appointments just because of a new patient.&quot; Wait, had he just rejected Celestia&#039;s personal request? <i>&#039;Horseapples!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Princess Celestia&#039;s smile and words calmed his own thoughts. &quot;I wouldn&#039;t expect anything less. Don&#039;t worry, she&#039;s living here in the castle right now and will be as long as she needs to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then there&#039;s no trouble, I&#039;ll see her,&quot; Sound Mind nodded. &quot;Who is this pony, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s one of the friends I made in Ponyville a few days ago,&quot; it was the white unicorn, Rarity according to her introduction, who spoke while levitating a folder towards him. &quot;Her name is Twilight Sparkle and she was working as Ponyville&#039;s librarian.&quot; The folder has a picture of a lavender earth pony with a purple mane and a starburst as her cutie mark. &quot;I... please help her!&quot; Rarity suddenly broke down crying, barely holding herself with both forelegs in the table and surprising Sound Mind at how much Rarity was holding herself back all this time. &quot;She helped us so much and now... and now she just... lost herself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Closing the folder Sound Mind decided &quot;I don&#039;t have any appointments this afternoon. Let me check her file and I can see her in about an hour.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you.&quot; Rarity said on a soft voice, showing a small if tired smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then you can use the royal study, and in an hour we&#039;ll lead you to Twilight Sparkle&#039;s room.&quot; Princess Celestia provided.</p><p class="double">Sound Mind nodded, taking the folder and... &quot;Erm...&quot; the earth pony mumbled and looked around as he realized he didn&#039;t have anything to carry the folder.</p><p class="double">That somehow made Rarity bounce back to normal immediately. &quot;Oh! Wait a moment.&quot; Going to a corner of the room, Rarity emptied a saddlebag, most probably hers at it had her cutie mark, and brought it back with her magic grip. &quot;Here, darling. Please use this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it&#039;s yours, there&#039;s no need,&quot; Sound Mind shook his head to try to reject but Rarity wouldn&#039;t have anything of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about it,&quot; Rarity said in a genial tone. &quot;I can always get another later or levitate my things myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sound Mind got a little nervous. &#039;Darling&#039;? offering those gifts so easily, marked with her own cutie mark no less? He just hoped Rarity didn&#039;t get a crush on him, he had a wife after all.</p><p class="double">Apparently Princess Celestia realized this as she made a small laugh. &quot;Please don&#039;t worry too much. This is just how Rarity addresses everypony.&quot;</p><p class="double">Calm Mind blinked, more relaxed. &quot;Okay...&quot; After a moment of silence he spoke again. &quot;So, where&#039;s the study? I&#039;d like to start reading Ms. Sparkle&#039;s file right away.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, please?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity just nodded. &quot;No problem, Princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity will lead you to the study, and we&#039;ll be carrying you to Twilight Sparkle&#039;s room in an hour. See you later, Sound Mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">Not forgetting to bow, the stallion answered &quot;Until later, Princess Celestia.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In one of the guest bedrooms Twilight was resting on the bed. &quot;So, still feeling woozy?&quot; she said, apparently to nopony in particular.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Still a bit, mom.&#039;</i> Nyx answered from inside her. This was a variant where Rarity was Princess Celestia&#039;s student instead, though something interesting happened when confronting Nightmare Moon: Nyx Awoke just when the Elements were healing Princess Luna, somehow making the Elements place the weak last remains of Nightmare Moon&#039;s consciousness, Nyx, into Twilight&#039;s mind. Not that she minded, she loved to meet her daughter again.</p><p class="double">&quot;You realize you&#039;re making me look like a crazy pony, right?&quot; Twilight asked in mock annoyment.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;As much as you realize you don&#039;t have to speak aloud to talk to me? Yes.&#039;</i> Nyx snarked back before mother and daughter giggled in unison.</p><p class="double">After calming themselves Twilight started walking to the door. &quot;Well, when you&#039;re better we can make the whole Eternal Twilight routine again. Meanwhile, why don&#039;t we get us some ice cream?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Yay!&#039;</i> Nyx happily agreed. She couldn&#039;t eat ice cream as she didn&#039;t have a body but this was the next best thing. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">122.13</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, this is going to cause comment,&quot; Twilight observed.</p><p class="double">&quot;How so?&quot; Rarity asked, with a frown. &quot;It&#039;s hardly the first time Spike and I have re-married in a loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes, I admit that.&quot; Twilight then pointed. &quot;But this is the first time you&#039;ve been a sea pony and Spike has been a griffin.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike examined his plumage, which was mostly purple. &quot;That&#039;s not the most fun bit, either.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What is the most fun bit, then?&quot; Twilight asked, in the tones of someone who was determined to get this over with.</p><p class="double">&quot;Before you stands the ruler of the Griffins!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Wow. Okay, you&#039;ve only had a couple of days since I saw you last, and you certainly weren&#039;t Emperor then. How did you pull that off?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I didn&#039;t.&quot; Spike pointed at his wife. &quot;That would be her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...right.&quot; Twilight shot Rarity a look. &quot;Seriously?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was visiting my dear Spiky-feathered-Wikey&#039;s parents - Gilda&#039;s his sister, small world - and the Emperor insulted his judgement for becoming infatuated with a hippocampus.&quot; Rarity examined her fins. &quot;One thing led to another.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;At least partly because of a hippopotamus joke,&quot; Spike stage-whispered. &quot;Anyway, the coronation&#039;s tomorrow and the wedding two days after that. That does mean we&#039;re going to miss Discord&#039;s return, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. No problem, Diamond&#039;s around, she can sub in for you.&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;Just... please give me a warning before the next time something like this happens?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Where would the fun be in that?&quot; Spike asked. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>123.1</p><p class="double">&quot;Well...&quot; Blade said, closing the second book with the soft sound of pages turning. &quot;That was an interesting read.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kit nodded agreement. &quot;Yes, it was. Quite nostalgic, in its own way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Especially for me.&quot; Elda flicked back through her own copy to about halfway. &quot;Was I really <i>that</i> oblivious? The poor man...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Kit chuckled. &quot;Yes, you were.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please tell me I&#039;ve improved...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no contest.&quot; Her differently-shaped brothers nodded, not quite in unison.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank goodness for that.&quot; Elda closed her own copy. &quot;Well, thank you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged. &quot;No problem. I&#039;m just glad to meet more looping griffins, we&#039;re not as common as we could be.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what about me?&quot; Blade asked with a grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Honorary griffin,&quot; Gilda replied promptly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good to know.&quot; Blade looked from brother to sister, then got out a bottle of wine and four glasses. He poured out a half measure into each, smiling faintly. &quot;I&#039;d like to propose a toast.&quot;</p><p class="double">He cleared his throat. &quot;To Diana, who told it so well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;To Diana,&quot; the griffins echoed.</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Gilda said, once that was over. &quot;What happened after the Year of the Griffin?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why not wait and find out?&quot; Kit asked, smiling as well as one could with a beak.</p><p class="double">&quot;If I have to,&quot; Gilda sighed. &quot;Hey... you know how your dad is going to be a fake Dark Lord?&quot;</p><p class="double">Blade nodded, just ahead of his siblings.</p><p class="double">Gilda smirked, then switched to celestial-brush mode, her fur and feathers bleaching out. A sinister-looking sword appeared on her back, and her tail arched up over it. &quot;Want an extra villain?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We normally solve the whole thing in about a week...&quot; Kit mused. &quot;But that could be fun. I&#039;ll suggest it to Dad.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.2</p><p class="double">“Okay, so that&#039;s on a five minute timer,” Twilight went on. “Once it expires, that&#039;s when you get Freki and Geri to come charging out with their noses lit up, and say-”</p><p class="double">“Question,” Lemon Rush interrupted.</p><p class="double">Twilight stopped. “Go on.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks. Well...” Rush looked uncomfortable. “I suppose it&#039;s only just occurred to me... how does this fit with the whole &#039;safe loop&#039; thing?”</p><p class="double">“What?” Twilight parsed the question again. “Okay, I think I understand your question. How do the pranks fit in with the idea of a safe loop?”</p><p class="double">Rush nodded.</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight turned away from their planning board. “This is something which I&#039;ve given a lot of thought to – all of us have – and we think this is self-consistent. If you see a problem with it, please, let us know.”</p><p class="double">Nod. “Agreed,” the colt said, sitting down.</p><p class="double">“Right. Well, the first axiom we started with was this: &#039;Anything permanent requires informed consent.&#039;”</p><p class="double">Rush asked her to repeat it, to make sure he had the phrasing down. “Okay. Let&#039;s see... define &#039;informed&#039;. And &#039;consent&#039;.”</p><p class="double">“Informed means...” Twilight mulled it over, searching for the words. “Cognizant of the downsides of the process, downsides defined as broadly as possible. Consent means either that positive consent has been given, or that it has been made clear that not performing a specific action means that negative consent has been given and the action has been rejected.”</p><p class="double">She noticed his hoof starting to raise, and clarified. “Not necessarily at the time, but only for things for which being fully informed at-the-time are deleterious, such as Ascension – if someone wanted to Ascend, they would give permission, and then at some future date if they no longer wished to they could withdraw that permission.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you for the example,” Rush said. “And Permanent?”</p><p class="double">“Differs depending on if they&#039;re looping or not. For loopers, it means anything psychological or mental, or persistent-loop physical. Anything potentially traumatic, anything which changes their mind.” Twilight shrugged awkwardly. “It&#039;s hard to be precise, but – for example, ascension is persistent, so that requires prior consent if it&#039;s being arranged. Psychiatric therapy is another thing which we do not give if there is no consent – but if it has been made clear that someone must simply leave to avoid it, and they do not, and it is in their power to do so, then that is treated as consent – though we stop if asked.”</p><p class="double">“You <i>have</i> put a lot of thought into this.” Rush tapped a hoof on the floor. “So... what about for non-loopers?”</p><p class="double">“Almost the opposite. Nothing fatal, crippling or significantly mentally altering.” Twilight looked embarrassed. “The Elements of Harmony are borderline – they&#039;re basically grandfathered in because they predate this system, but we&#039;ve gathered a lot of experimental data and as far as we can tell they don&#039;t actually do anything beyond a course of mental therapy – and that&#039;s only when they&#039;re set on that mode.”</p><p class="double">She shrugged. “I should stress that these rules can be bent when applied to out-and-out villains.”</p><p class="double">“Like Jadis?” Lemon asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight gave him a sharp look.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy mentioned her once,” he clarified. “Used her as an example.”</p><p class="double">“Well, then... yes, like Jadis.” Twilight sighed. “I had no guaranteed way of stopping her that would ensure she didn&#039;t use the Deplorable Word, and I didn&#039;t have a counterspell.” She looked moderately happier as that topic came up. “I&#039;m working on developing one, though, in the hope that if I end up there again then I can contain her non-fatally.”</p><p class="double">She blew air through her lips. “None of this is perfect, and we don&#039;t pretend to be. We just try to do the best we can.”</p><p class="double">“And, going back to the original topic... pranks?” Lemon asked, moving it back onto firmer ground.</p><p class="double">“Pranks are easy,” Twilight said, nodding over to the <i>other</i> board. “Have you seen how thoroughly we plan out the cleanup?”</p><p class="double">Lemon looked. “That is scary even to someone who&#039;s administered ten thousand warriors and their support services.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, when we tell the prank stories to other loopers we <i>do</i> stop before that bit,” Twilight agreed. “Though I know Pinkie Pie made up a song about cleaning which was surprisingly catchy.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.3 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double"><i>Let&#039;s see...

I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m not going to misuse and corrupt them. And nobody&#039;s here to see if I fail. At most, some foreign anchor who doesn&#039;t know who I am will know that someone failed, which shouldn&#039;t be unusual. I just need to keep from doing anything that gives away who I am.</i></p><p class="double">She slowly got up, then, with growing confidence, ran off to the tower.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike?&quot; she called out, slamming the door open, hitting Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ow.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. I&#039;m so sorry! I, ah, didn&#039;t know you were there.&quot; <i>Notes for next time I loop as Twilight: do not nail Spike with door. Also, contrition check: genuine. Score! So far so good for qualifying!</i> She clenched a hoof in a slight pumping motion. &quot;Can you take a letter to Princess Celestia?&quot;</p><p class="double">He fetched a quill and paper, &quot;All right. Dear Princess Celestia...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Hmm. Oh snap. I don&#039;t know precisely what she would know at this point since I deviated. And I haven&#039;t memorized her letter.</i> &quot;Thank you for the edifying reading. The timing does seem very co-incidental... use the dash since I mean in the sense that it happened at the same time... with the predicted return of your sister from the moon tonight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Keep writing, Spike. Since you assigned this reading to me and not, say, my brother, I deduce that this is a myth rather than a threat. On the other hand, I...&quot; <i>well... what now? Also, &#039;hoof&#039;.</i> &quot;...don&#039;t want to assume when so much is at stake. Your faithful student...&quot; <i>Sunset Shimmer. Faithless student, as far as she remembers me. Repairing my relationship with her Awake self doesn&#039;t extend here.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;... Twilight Sparkle. Okay.&quot; He sent it, and a few moments later, the return note was just what she had been expecting. Upon finishing reading it, Spike let out a sigh of relief. &quot;You know, you had me kind of worried, for a moment.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Everything&#039;s going to be fine, Spike.&quot;</p><p class="double">He looked at her warily. &quot;That&#039;s... actually not helping.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I guess I was more &#039;I can take this&#039; than &#039;there is no problem&#039;, wasn&#039;t I?</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The tense mood evaporated by the time they reached Ponyville. Sunset let Pinkie breathe in, scream, and run.</p><p class="double">&quot;Weird ponies here.&quot; Spike commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;There are tales of a pony who would shriek and run from any pony she meets. And then, she prepares, long and hard. And then, when her target least suspected it, BAM! Surprise welcome party.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike was still blinking when a nearby cloud suddenly laughed, &quot;Ha!&quot; Rainbow Dash fell out and landed on a puddle, covering them both.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that was perfect! Hmm. How about I dry you off with my patented...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m familiar with it - patent number 50,732: Technique for drying utilizing a circular flight path around the target.&quot; Sunset improvised.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash blinked, then guffawed. &quot;Yeah! Only I made up the part about the patent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So did I. Don&#039;t worry some patent troll is going to come along and make you pay a fee.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike looked at Twilight oddly for the moment Rainbow took to wind up; then he was too dizzy.</p><p class="double"><i>I guess with this hair, it&#039;ll be time for Rarity after &#039;ten seconds flat&#039;?</i></p><p class="double">After similarly tweaked encounters with the other three, she ended up at the party. She tried to cement her bonds to the others, but was left wondering what she&#039;d do when Nightmare Moon came. She didn&#039;t want to win, and she needed to make sure that the others would follow her afterwards.</p><p class="double">&quot;You all right, Sugarcube?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey. Didn&#039;t expect to see you here, what with the reunion.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Had to bring the goods in, and then... well Pinkie knows parties.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Glad to see you.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a few seconds, Applejack leaned in. &quot;Something on your mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer sighed. &quot;Of course. I hope it&#039;s nothing. Worried about the Celebration.&quot; <i>It is pretty rare for Nightmare Moon to actually just be a myth, but it does happen from time to time. On the other hand, now that I think of it, I don&#039;t actually hope it&#039;s nothing, do I? At least I meant it when I said it.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ll pull it off, don&#039;t fret.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset took a deep breath. <i>How long? Oh shoot. Is the Celebration at dawn or some other time in this variant?</i> After a moment, she recalled the previous Summer Sun Celebration. <i>It&#039;ll be at Midnight here. So, not too long.</i> &quot;I agree we&#039;ll muddle through somehow, I&#039;m sure. Thanks for asking.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Which of the others have I been with least? Fluttershy.</i> She looked around and, to her surprise, found her on the dance floor. <i>Dancing seems like a good way.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t you know who I am?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer stepped forward. &quot;I know who you are. In <i>general</i> you&#039;re Princess Luna, but presently &#039;Nightmare Moon&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">The cold stone eyes met her fiery eyes, and an eyebrow twitched. &quot;&#039;Presently&#039;? I have been Nightmare Moon longer than you can imagine. Long centuries of waiting, now over. The night will last <i>forever!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">As she turned into mist and oozed out of the building, Sunset remained still. <i>Not a muscle, Sunset. No early takedowns. Eyes on the prize.</i></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash finally fought herself free of Applejack&#039;s restraint. &quot;You <i>knew</i>!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer felt a moment&#039;s warning - a quarter of a second, no more - before her loop ended. She woke into her usual High School morning. &quot;What?&quot; She checked, and found she had a fresh set of Loop Memories. It was that morning, not that evening. &quot;No! I was right on track!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double">Vinyl Awoke just in time to get knocked the buck out by a high speed hoof to the face. It wasn&#039;t the worst start she&#039;d had to a Loop. An improvement over the time she gotten hit by a bus, and leagues better than the time she&#039;d been in the process of dying before going on an afterlife adventure.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anypony get that wagon&#039;s cutie mark?&quot; She mumbled as she came around. As much as she&#039;d regret the headache, it was a blessing in disguise. Waking up in the traditional sense gave her a moment to sort out her Loop memories.</p><p class="double">Letter to Celestia, Summer Sun Celebration, yadda yadda Nightmare Moon. Yup, looks like I&#039;m Sparklebutt. Something had seemed off about the speech to Nightmare, but it&#039;d been a long time since baseline and she&#039;d never listened that close to begin with.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow!&quot; Applejack was scolding. &quot;There weren&#039;t no call fer that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She knew this was coming!&quot; Dash shouted back. &quot;She could be a spy or a cultist or I don&#039;t know what!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, Ah agree she knew somethin&#039;, but that don&#039;t make her an enemy. Ain&#039;t that right?&quot; She added, turning to Vi- Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you and how did you know this was coming?&quot; Dash demanded, suddenly right in her face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Could ya give me a minute? I just Woke up.&quot; She looked blearily around the room and didn&#039;t spot any kind of acknowledgement. Looked like she was on her own. &quot;I knew because of who I am,&quot; she stuck out a hoof and plastered on a manic grin. &quot;I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle, and I know everything.&quot;</p><p class="double">That didn&#039;t seem have garnered anything but confusion and a vague air of concern, so she trotted over to her unawake self.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, you got Ultra Def Mix Three?&quot; She asked, leaning over the turntables.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; the other Vinyl answered. &quot;But I was gonna premier it at the after party. How&#039;d you hear about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle,&quot; she answered, tapping herself on the chest. &quot;I know everything. So, can I get that record?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; the DJ answered, hoofing over a disk of her namesake.</p><p class="double">She seized it in her magic and trotted out the door to the general confusion of everypony in the room. Vinyl Scratch had a plan. Anypony who knew her would have been rather worried by this.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Are you serious? You can&#039;t be serious. Oh my me, you&#039;re serious,&quot; Nightmare Moon rambled as she examined the purple unicorn confronting her. The mare had pulled a portable turn table and speaker system from somewhere and was setting them up in the old castle&#039;s throne room. A number of ponies from the town had followed her up, and most of them seemed just as incredulous as the monarch.</p><p class="double">&quot;Buck yeah I&#039;m serious! You an&#039; me, here an&#039; now, break dance battle for the fate of Equestria!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If it is battle you desire,&quot; Nightmare rumbled, spreading her wings and casting her mane out in a menacing cloud. &quot;I will grant it to you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Drop it!&quot; Vinyl called out, and her baseline counterpart took charge of the equipment. A heavy bass beat filled the ruins, shaking the ancient bricks in their mortar. Ponies backed up for a moment, worrying that the building might actually come down around them, but the structure held.</p><p class="double">She dropped to the ground, spinning and contorting in ways that the bookworm&#039;s body wasn&#039;t used to. Seizing the music, she gathered it close, feeling the pulse and rhythm as she shaped it. She slapped one hoof to the ground to halt her spin while the other flicked out. A whip of solidified sound sang through the air and flung Nightmare Moon into the far wall.</p><p class="double">That was when the roof started falling in.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I must say,&quot; Celestia began as she surveyed the destruction. &quot;While I&#039;m proud of you for rescuing my sister and myself, I hadn&#039;t expected you to do it this way.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Castle of the Two Pony Sister was in ruins, significantly moreso than it had been the previous day. Nopony had been hurt, with the obvious exception of the mistress of eternal night, but many appeared shaken.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeeaah...&quot; Vinyl said, rubbing at the back of her head. &quot;I didn&#039;t really think that one through.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia adopted the slightest frown as she tried to come up with an elegant way of saying &#039;ya think?&#039;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright everypony!&quot; Vinyl called out to the gathered crowd. The citizens of Ponyville had been a bit skittish around her ever since she&#039;d single hoofedly struck down a god and demolished a castle, but everypony had their price. The price in this case was a pair of tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve got two tickets to the Gala and no desire to go. Seeing as I don&#039;t wanna waste &#039;em, I thought to myself, what&#039;s the fairest way to give &#039;em away? There&#039;s only clear option: Dance contest.&quot; There was a general shuffling away from her at that declaration. They all remembered what had happened at the last one. &quot;Hey, I told&#039;ya I don&#039;t wanna go, I&#039;m sitin&#039; this one out. &#039;Sides, this ain&#039;t about style. Endurance, last one dancin&#039;, however they dance, gets the tickets.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd settled a bit at that.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright,&quot; Vinyl began, raising her hoof to signal her counterpart to start the music. &quot;Drop-&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;-it,&quot; Vinyl mumbled as she tumbled out of bed to land in a tangled pile of sheets. Squinting against the unfettered rays of the accursed morning sun, she wondered what had just happened. Then she shrugged, tugged her pillow off the bed, and hid her head under the sheets. It could wait &#039;til mid afternoon.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">“-It?”</p><p class="double">Ditzy Doo Awoke speaking. She really hoped this wasn&#039;t another loop in that one forest, the nice tall people with the funny hats seemed hurt when she said that word. Then she looked around.</p><p class="double">The world was sitting still for once, unlike all the ponies, who were dancing about to some sort of music. That looked like fun, even if the music wasn&#039;t the best for dancing. She sang along anyway.</p><p class="double">“Wub, wub, wubwubwub”</p><p class="double">Even though the beat was simple, it was infectious. She could feel her body start to move to the beat, and since everypony else seemed to be having a good time, she began dancing along with them.</p><p class="double">“Wubwubwub, wubbity wub-wub”</p><p class="double">Since she could see clearly this time, the first few seconds of the dance went well.</p><p class="double">“Wubwub, wub-wub wub-wub”</p><p class="double">After those few seconds though, she started to let the rhythm guide her movements. To better feel the rhythm, she closed her eyes.</p><p class="double">“Wuuuuuuuuuub, wubwubwub”</p><p class="double">She wasn&#039;t trying to knock ponies over, honestly.</p><p class="double">“Wub-wub-wubwubwub”</p><p class="double">The impacts were easy to mistake for others getting jiggy with it too,</p><p class="double">“Wub, wub, wubbity-wub”</p><p class="double">and Ditzy was more than happy to up the ante in response as the beat grew stronger.</p><p class="double">“WUBWUB, WUBBITY-Weeeeoooo”</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t until the screech of a speaker getting crashed into silenced the music that she realized something was wrong.</p><p class="double">She opened her eyes.</p><p class="double">Practically every pony in Ponyville was scattered on the ground, in varying degrees of bruised and bemused. Big Macintosh was struggling to extract his head from one of the stereo speakers. The only ponies standing were herself and a mare she recognized as Vinyl Scratch, who was behind a deejay table. Vinyl seemed pleased, despite the damage to her equipment, applauded, and pumped a hoof in the air.</p><p class="double">“Arright, that was metal! But since you&#039;re the last pony dancing, I guess you get your tickets back?”</p><p class="double">Hm, tickets?</p><p class="double">Oh, right. Tickets.</p><p class="double">Prompted by that magic word, the loop memories started floating to the surface in drips and drabs. How desperately everypony wanted a ticket. How she&#039;d decided, for whatever reason, to hold a dance contest to solve the issue. And how silly it was to have participated in that same dance contest only to win the tickets back.</p><p class="double">Ponies started picking themselves up, groaning, rubbing at sore spots, and scowling at her.</p><p class="double">“Um, my bad?”</p><p class="double">The apology did not seem to mollify any of the testy-looking townsfolk.</p><p class="double">“Er, rematch?”</p><p class="double">When that didn&#039;t seem to help either, she started edging away from the scene. She almost made it too. Rarity was nursing a black eye, but paused in her rubbing long enough to point at Ditzy and yell.</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s getting away!”</p><p class="double">The chase that followed was long and convoluted. She tried to fly away, to at least narrow the pursuit down to Rainbow Dash and the other pegasi. This was prevented because her wings weren&#039;t working for some reason.</p><p class="double">Distracted momentarily, she wasn&#039;t looking where she was going and booped her snout on a storefront. “Mirrors and Scrolls” wasn&#039;t a store she bumped into, normally, but this encounter proved enlightening.</p><p class="double">“Oh.”</p><p class="double">The predominantly purple pony peering back at her was more than enough explanation for why flight was currently unfeasible. The sight of an angry mob behind that purple pony was what got her moving again. She took off down an alleyway, the angry shouts and thundering hooves practically on her tail.</p><p class="double">“Alright Ditzy, you&#039;ve had a horn before. Now you just have to use it without the benefit of having an alicorn&#039;s huge magic reserve. Think, think, thinkthinkthink.”</p><p class="double">Thinking about trying to use her horn unfortunately left her navigation up to instinct. Ditzy turned a corner and then bumped her snout on a door. A jiggle of the handle revealed it to be locked. She looked around for another escape route. The door was at the end of a dead-end alley, and before she could get out the angry herds had rounded the corner.</p><p class="double">Trapped.</p><p class="double">Ditzy desperately tried to think of an escape, but wound up just using the first spell that came to mind. That the spell was Prichard&#039;s Spontaneous Pachyderm weighed little on Ms. Doo, as the doing anything seemed better than doing nothing.</p><p class="double">A large gray creature almost as tall as the surrounding buildings sprung into existence in front of her, nearly filling the alley with impassible animal. While this barred the way to Ditzy, it also cut her off from any obvious avenue of escape. As she racked her brains for some other way out of this, the elephant trumpeted restlessly, breaking her concentration. It was pointed away from her, so it was probably worse for the others.</p><p class="double">That consolation went away, though, when her ears picked up whispering.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Uh-oh.</p><p class="double">The elephant shuffled to the side, and the angry herds filtered around it and started coming down the alley ominously.</p><p class="double">Out of ideas, Ditzy just closed her eyes and started whispering to herself.</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s no place like home, there&#039;s no place like home.”</p><p class="double">She could feel a warm glow just above her head, she heard a pop, and then she was someplace else.</p><p class="double">Upon opening her eyes though, all she saw was the door she&#039;d been backed up against. Then Applejack&#039;s voice filtered through from the other side.</p><p class="double">“Ah heard her say &#039;thar&#039;s no place like home&#039;. She musta gone to the library!”</p><p class="double">Then the noise of the crowd receded, accompanied by the stomp of an elephant and the sound of it trumpeting a cavalry call. Silence fell for a few seconds, as Ditzy remained riveted to the floor, staring at the solid door between her and the alleyway. She was indoors now, so things remained quiet until she heard a voice from behind her.</p><p class="double">“Mommy, what was all the noise?”</p><p class="double">Ditzy smiled, and reassured her daughter.</p><p class="double">“Oh, just some ponies who wanted to talk. Nothing to worry about, muffin.”</p><p class="double">It took Ditzy a second to remember why that might not have been a good thing to say. She turned around, and sure enough, she was in her house in Ponyville, by the back door. Over there in the living room were a gray mare with a blond mane and her daughter, staring at her like she was some sort of space alien.</p><p class="double">“Um,”</p><p class="double">To rectify the situation, she pulled something out of her subspace pocket. It was a small white box with Capsu Corp written on it in block capitals. The only other visible feature of the device was a large red button, which she promptly pushed. The thing buzzed, and then a fresh blueberry-flavored pastry sprang into being in her hoof. She held it out as a peace offering.</p><p class="double">“-muffin?”</p><p class="double">The next day, Ditzy was relaxing in the library. The whole situation had just needed a letter to the princess, vigorous use of the muffin button, and a loofah to sort out, and now she was friends with most of Ponyville again. Or at least, those whose loyalties could be bought with pastry, so mostly just her unawake self, Dinky, and Pinkie Pie. The rest of the town had at least decided to leave her alone after getting the tickets, although Applejack, Rarity and Fluttershy had each since come by to apologize for imposing like they had. She honestly didn&#039;t mind, but there was a niggling feeling she&#039;d forgotten somepony...</p><p class="double">It was at this moment that Rainbow Dash was sent careening through the upstairs window, to impact the south wall and slide down it, squeakily. Ditzy rushed over, but Rainbow didn&#039;t seem injured. She simply muttered,</p><p class="double">“Applejack, I just don&#039;t know what went wrong.”</p><p class="double">and then slumped on the floor.</p><p class="double">Before Ditzy could move to help, she Awoke in the middle of her route, hauling the mail towards Sugar Cube Corner, but the sudden shift from examining somepony and using magic to holding something heavy and flying sent her off-balance, tumbling into Quills and Mattresses. Blowing a stray feather off her nose, she waved to the store&#039;s owner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Lyra blinked a bit as she Awoke, trying to determine exactly where she was.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, we&#039;ve got ourselves a horn,</i> Classic mused. <i>By body shape, we&#039;re definitely an equestrian unicorn--</i></p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t recall ever starting a loop this fit,</i> Seapony commented.</p><p class="double"><i>Hey!</i> shouted a blushing Human. <i>Are you calling us fat?!</i></p><p class="double"><i>We </i><i>generally</i><i> live with a candymaker and practice bipedal locomotion,</i> Robo Science Thief pointed out. <i>Being slightly out of shape is the norm--</i></p><p class="double"><i>....</i></p><p class="double">The whole council froze at Sweet Roll&#039;s comment, focusing their gaze on the blue pegasus slumped against a bookshelf. Ah, Ponyville library, that made sense--! She filtered through her memories quickly – there were, oddly enough, not nearly as many as she got in a usual loop – and let out a sigh. &quot;She&#039;s overworking herself in the orchards?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked up at Lyra and shrugged. &quot;I don&#039;t know Twi, but it wouldn&#039;t surprise me.

I&#039;m... going... to be awesome... somewhere else!&quot;</p><p class="double">She darted out of the library as though Tirek himself was on her tail.</p><p class="double"><i>Overplaying it, don&#039;t you think?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Oh come on, Human, let me have my fun! And anyway, this loop&#039;s Twilight is crazy already, she wubbed for the gala tickets and then gave more then enough away to Ponyville.</i> The unicorn shrugged to herself, headed down to her basement. &quot;Spike!

I&#039;m sure that will sort things all out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah... yes, um... qu-quite.&quot; Rarity backed away from Twilight&#039;s big grin. &quot;Do... come out and check on us when you&#039;re done, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Will do!&quot; Twilight turned back to her work, humming to herself. &quot;The ganglions connected to the... dendrites, the dendrites connected to the... neurons, the neurons connected to the... everything, oh what a wonder it will beeeeeeee....&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The library door burst open. &quot;TWILIGHT!

I heard you needed help harvesting!&quot;</p><p class="double">For a moment, nopony said anything.</p><p class="double">Then Twilight coughed. &quot;Er, this is going to sound weird, but... why is the library in Sweet Apple Acres?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You, ah... you just drove it here darling.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Right. Makes sense.&#039; Twilight nodded to herself. &quot;I&#039;ll be... down in a second...&quot; She stepped into the library quietly.</p><p class="double">Rarity and Rainbow shared a look.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;.. and you should be proud, my little ponies, for operating such a successful and well-run business!&quot;</p><p class="double">The managers and employees of the Manehattan Metropolitan Cake and Pastry Works bowed deeply once again, thanking Princess Celestia for her gracious words.</p><p class="double">Luna, standing off to one side, looked much less gracious, but she managed, &quot;Yes, thank you for your hospitality. I wish we could remain longer, but royal affairs are pressing. Shall we go, sister?&quot;</p><p class="double">Once outside, Celestia turned to Luna and said, &quot;So, how much cake did I eat?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s ears drooped. &quot;Not a bite.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Told you I could do it,&quot; Celestia grinned. &quot;Pay up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna levitated a bag of tea to Celestia. &quot;Mikuru Asahina&#039;s special blend,&quot; she sighed. &quot;You would not believe how much trading it took to get that...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight and I will think of your sacrifice as we drink it,&quot; Celestia grinned. &quot;Now, I believe the cheese shop is next on the itinerary, is it not?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.5 (Pinklestia)</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay... I know I been whining for ages about wanting a different cutie mark, but waking up with a different one is not the same that earning it.&quot; Twilight Sparkle was a pony named Sparking Apple for this loop. Her cutie mark was a zap apple, apparently she had won it after finding new magical uses for them. They had sent her to study to Canterlot and she had become princess Celestia&#039;s personal student after hatching a dragon egg, only it had been a year later than at baseline. Sadly, only she and her five friends were awake.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Sparkling , don&#039;t worry! There are things I can&#039;t do too.&quot; Pinkie Pie was Pinkamena Diana Apple, also known as Pinkie Di or just Pinkie, Her cutie mark was an apple birthday cake. She had got it after baking an apple cake and making a surprise party for her pet Gummy the rock frog.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am a tad ashamed to admit it, but I have been waiting for the six of us to be awake in a loop like this.&quot; Applejack was... well, no real change for her this loop, besides having the rest of her friends as relatives.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I get to be the older sister? I admit I am not used to being this big, but it gives me the chance to try making different dresses.&quot; Rarity actually was Applejack&#039;s older sister this loop, she had got her name because it was a &#039;rarity&#039; for a unicorn to be born in an Earth pony family. Also, she was almost a tall as Big Mac. Due to money problems, she had gone to stay with some relatives that did rock farming, where she found her talent was related to gems. That&#039;s how she got three apples shaped diamonds as cutie mark. Instead of a dressmaker, she was a jeweler.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... I feel strangely comfortable this loop.&quot; Fluttershy was Shy Apple, a distant relative of the Apple family that lived in the Everfree and was the Royal forest ranger. She had got an apple shield cutie mark after saving her sister Rainbow from a Manticore. The reason Fluttershy felt comfortable was because this loop she was way more confident in herself than at baseline. Yet she was still shy and had trouble meeting new ponies. Her cutie mark meant that she was a protector, not just of ponies, but also of animals (And monsters). And yes, she was still a Pegasus.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh... at least my name isn&#039;t zap apple.&quot; Rainbow Dash was Rainbow Apple, named that way because there was already a pony named Zap Apple in the Apple family, and because Zap was a guy&#039;s name. She still had the same cutie mark, since she might or not be adopted this loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well family, is time to prepare the baked goods, the summer sun celebration will be tomorrow!&quot; Applejack said in a cheerful tone, she couldn&#039;t wait to see non awake princess Celestia&#039;s face when she found out all the element bearers were part of the same family! </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.6 (zeusdemigod131)</p><p class="double">For Discord, his Awakenings weren&#039;t usually pleasant. Half the time, he Awoke as a statue, less often, he’d Awaken just before getting hit with the Elements for the first time.</p><p class="double">So waking up encased in amber, while unusual, wasn&#039;t that startling. “<i>Well, this won’t do.”</i></p><p class="double">Exerting a bit of his power, Discord melted the amber back into tree sap. Looking down at his body, he saw that he was more of a skeleton than usual, and was wearing tattered green and grey robes.</p><p class="double">“Ew.” Snapping his fingers, Discord returned himself to his normal resplendently chaotic form.</p><p class="double">Discord tapped his foot as he waited for his Loop memories to set in, after a moment, he remembered that he was Discord, terror of the Land of Ooo, sewer of Chaos. Apparently, he had tried to make the population of a post apocalyptic world as chaotic as he was.</p><p class="double">“Seems like I did a good enough job,” The Draconequus mused, looking out over a kingdom made of chocolate and gumdrops. “And some villains complain that Equestria’s a sugar bowl.”</p><p class="double">Chuckling to himself, Discord flew over the city, and into the castle that seemed to have been built around a large tree. “Reminds me of that tacky crystal palace Twilight keeps getting stuck with,” Discord peeled off some of the wallpaper and ate it. “Though the walls aren’t usually made of taffy.”</p><p class="double">“What the lump are you doing here?!”</p><p class="double">Discord whirled around and found himself looking down at a rather pink human with some kind of weapon in her hand.</p><p class="double">“You have three seconds to tell me why I shouldn’t blast you into atoms.” The pink woman said in practically a growl.</p><p class="double">Discord eyed the weapon again. “Are you going to threatening to shoot me with a tennis ball?”</p><p class="double">“My Ball Blam Burglerber can blow you to-”</p><p class="double"><i>snap</i></p><p class="double">The weapon was suddenly replaced with a golden scepter with Twilight’s head on it. “It’s gold wrapped chocolate.” Discord said with a grin.</p><p class="double">Throwing the scepter to the ground, the woman pulled a pair of pink gauntlets from seemingly thin air. “Alright, now talk.” The gauntlets glowed blue with an electric charge.</p><p class="double">Discord tapped his chin. “By any chance, do you know what the phrase ‘I’m Looping, so calm the heck down’ means?”</p><p class="double">Groaning, the woman dropped her gauntlets back in her Pocket. “Should have figured when you weren’t the Lich,” She sighed and raised her arms. “I’m Princess Bubblegum, now get the heck outta my kingdom!”</p><p class="double">“Oh come now Princess,” Discord said. “We haven’t even gotten to know each other yet.”</p><p class="double">Princess Bubblegum shook her head. “Nope, you wanna do something? Talk to Finn or Marceline, I don’t want anymore shenanigans in the Candy Kingdom than usual.”</p><p class="double">Discord frowned, he’d met beings like this before, though they weren’t usually Loopers. “Are you sure?” Discord asked. “You seem like the learning type, wouldn’t you like to see some chaos magic at work?”</p><p class="double">“Pfff, magic,” Bubblegum waved him off. “All magic is science, people like you just call it that because you don’t mphmffhmph.”</p><p class="double">Bubblegum grasped at her face and found her mouth had been buttoned shut.</p><p class="double">“See? Magic.” Discord said.</p><p class="double">Bubblegum rolled her eyes and unbuttoned her lips. “You transmuting part of my mouth doesn’t prove anything.”</p><p class="double">Discord snapped his fingers again and the Princesses hairdo was remolded into a bird nest, complete with living birds made of chocolate. “How about now?” Discord asked.</p><p class="double">Bubblegum shook her head, causing the chocolate birds to take flight. “Teleportation, and I rule a kingdom of living candy, you’ll have try harder than that.”</p><p class="double">Discord glared at the Princess. “Okay,” He said, stretching out his arms and cracking his knuckles. “Not like I can do much more damage to this world anyway.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A few hours later, and not far from the Candy Kingdom, a boy, a dog, and a vampire queen were making their way through what looked like a mixture of Wonderland, a Random Loot Loop, a three your old&#039;s finger painting, and a mad science lab.</p><p class="double">“Marceline?” Finn asked. “What exactly happened here?”</p><p class="double">The vampire queen shrugged. “I was going to check in on Bonnibel, just to see if she was Awake, and I saw... this.” She gestured to what might have been a tree at one point, but now looked more like a didgeridoo.</p><p class="double">“You think PB is playing crazy scientist this time?” Jake asked.</p><p class="double">“I don’t think so,” Finn sidestepped to avoid some kind of banjo/turtle. “This really isn’t PB’s thing.”</p><p class="double">“Admit it Princess!”</p><p class="double">“Never! You&#039;re just randomly reshaping and combining objects molecular and genetic structure! It’s a simple application of an entanglement field!”</p><p class="double">“I’ll tangle your field!”</p><p class="double">As if on command, the ground twisted and corkscrewed until it looked like a gnarled tree root.</p><p class="double">“You think Bonny pissed off another magic user?” Marceline asked.</p><p class="double">“Taste Yak cannon!”</p><p class="double">Hearing an explosion, followed by a loud moo, the three of them ran over the twisted ground and over a rather large lump, they spotted Bubblegum, on the back of a rather large swan, holding some kind of laser weapon, aiming it at a structure made of steel squirrel statues.</p><p class="double">“Discord!” Bubblegum shouted. “Stop messing up my Kingdom!”</p><p class="double">“We’re not in your kingdom!” Discord called back, peeking over the edge of his shelter. “Now, how about I shed a little light on our situation.”</p><p class="double">With a snap of his fingers, the ground, and everything else nearby, lit up like a light bulb.</p><p class="double">Marceline hissed, despite how long she’d been Looping, she was still sensitive to bright light.</p><p class="double">“Should we... do something?” Finn asked.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Marceline said, rubbing her exposed skin with SPF 5000. “This guy seems kinda-”</p><p class="double">“Turn off that light!”</p><p class="double">“With pleasure!”</p><p class="double">The bright light was suddenly replaced with utter darkness, it took a moment it realize the sun, moon, and stars weren’t shining either.</p><p class="double">“Powerful?” Jake supplied.</p><p class="double">“I was going to say nuts,” Marceline replied.</p><p class="double">“Hah! Jokes on you! I invented a nuclear powered flashlight!”</p><p class="double">“Big whoop, Twilight once made a fondue maker that ran off the Element of Magic!”</p><p class="double">“Grahh!”</p><p class="double">A bright red light lit up the darkness, it was followed by an explosion.</p><p class="double">“...Missed me!”</p><p class="double">There was another explosion.</p><p class="double">“Try again!”</p><p class="double">And another. “You’ve exceeded your maximum number of tries.”</p><p class="double">Large red letters flashed above everyone, spelling out the words. “GAME OVER!”</p><p class="double">“You wanna... go see if the Ice King is Awake?” Finn supplied.</p><p class="double">“Sounds like a plan.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.7 (Novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis ate a cookie.</p><p class="double">It was really just a simple action. Put the cookie inside your mouth, chew it up, swallow. Simple actions that can lead to enjoyment. However, as Twilight Sparkle watched, she could tell that the Changeling Queen was enjoying the dessert more than most beings could, especially with a very contented sigh escaping her lips and a slight blush creeping onto her cheeks.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Twilight broke the silence. &quot;That must have been some cookie. What kind was it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis had to think about that for a couple seconds. &quot;I think the best way to describe it would be a &#039;love cookie&#039;.&quot; The puzzlement on Twilight&#039;s face was obvious, so she continued. &quot;For the most part, it&#039;s just a plain sugar cookie. However, there is a special ingredient baked inside of them that, for the most part, only I could taste.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, it&#039;s love!&quot; Twilight exclaimed, before adding. &quot;It must be Trixie&#039;s love, isn&#039;t it?&quot;</p><p class="double">A nod. &quot;She&#039;d wanted me to have it for when she wasn&#039;t Awake. Goofy helped get some of her love for me into liquid form, and Pinkie Pie helped her bake the cookies. &quot; A small smile crept onto Chrysalis&#039; face. &quot;It&#039;s just one of those little things we do for each other.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.8 (Novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle walked in her ebony black Jimmy Choo&#039;s, her purple and pink Hot-Topic bought clothing and dark-as-night Gucci purse accenting her, as she walked towards her friend Rarity, dressed only in a purple strapless dress from Carousel Boutique clothing, the only brand worth wearing in her mind. </p><p class="double">Rarity sipped gently from her Aquafine bottle of water, while holding her leftovers from P.F. Chang&#039;s. She almost immediately noticed that Pinkie Pie was riding towards her on her gray Huffy Bike, being peddled by her Nike-clad feet, her Haus of Gaga clothing not inhibiting her, as she swayed her pink hair, washed in L&#039;oreal (because she was worth it) and flowing freely, while in her hand was her Lisa Frank notebook. </p><p class="double">Following her was Rainbow Dash, grinding a nearby rail with her Birdhouse skateboard, her Vans shoes, her Levi&#039;s shorts and No Fear tank top hugging her as she kickflipped off the grind. </p><p class="double">Trailing them was Applejack, walking along with a crisp Sweet Apple Acres apple being tossed and caught, her Faded Glory denim jeans and American Eagle shirt showing her no-nonsense-ness. </p><p class="double">And finally, Twilight could see Fluttershy, in a hand-knitted yellow sweater, her Dockers and store-brand flip-flops completing her ensemble as she carried her animal treats, bought from Petco, walk up beside her.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, noting that in this Loop, everyone had to know where anything had to have been either created or bought, in extreme detail. She even knew that this Loop was sponsored by McDonalds, but that didn&#039;t mean she had to love it... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.9 (DrTempo)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ever since the whole &#039;Battle of the Bands&#039; expansion, Twilight had to admit that baseline Sunset was a lot like the Awake version personality-wise. It just showed that Sunset was a better person now. Speaking of Sunset, she was smirking as the Dazzlings held up what looked like a...</p><p>Guitar pick?</p><p class="double">As they bragged on how this would make them music powerhouses, Twilight thought she&#039;d seen this before. &#039;Now why is this...familiar?&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly, the guitar picks flew towards Sunset, and in a burst of flame, she assumed her demon form. Before Twilight could react, Sunset roared, </p><p class="double"><i>I AM COMPLETE!</i></p><p class="double">The Dazzlings had only one thing to say as they saw the imposing figure, running away from the monster.</p><p><i>Buuuuuuuck!</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sunset smirked, slowly walking towards the trio, and laughed. </p><p><i>YES, YOU ARE BUCKED! SO OUT OF LUCK!</i></p><p><i>NOW I&#039;M COMPLETE, AND YOU HAD BETTER DUCK!</i></p><p><i>THIS WORLD WILL BE MINE, AND YOU&#039;RE FIRST IN LINE! YOU BROUGHT ME THE PICK, AND NOW YOU SHALL ALL DIE!</i></p><p class="double">As the song continued, Twilight groaned as she put two and two together. &#039;Sunset&#039;s Awake...and doing an encore of that prank she did with the Mirror Pool.</p><p class="double">Kinda fits, actually...&#039; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.10 (Bardic_Knowledge)</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why is, ah, &#039;Speed Force&#039; avoiding Sweet Apple Acres?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re not entirely sure why, but he keeps falling through the ground over there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that&#039;s right.

What can you do? Grow plants? Oh wait, you can&#039;t even do that, let alone fly or do magic!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, well, well...well at least ah&#039;m not a jerk like you, Tiara!&quot;</p><p class="double">Later that day...</p><p class="double">Applebloom felt miserable. She briefly wondered if she was supposed to feel miserable quite so soon, but the strange thought wasn&#039;t enough to distract her out of her depression. </p><p class="double">She kicked a pebble at a tree. &quot;Diamond Tiara&#039;s right...ah can&#039;t buck apples, ah can&#039;t sell apples, ah can&#039;t fly or do magic-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight overheard. &quot;Well, actually, there&#039;s a version of magic that even earth ponies can use-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Teach me teach me teachmeteachmeteachme-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s resistance to teaching a crusader anything dangerous crumbled before it could remember it existed. &quot;Ok ok! Uh, meet me at the library every, um, Tuesday evening?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YAY!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Usually, Twilight was careful about things like sleep deprivation: if sleep deprived, either cast a spell to not <i>need</i> the sleep, or else go to bed. But in the context of the loops, sooner or later she was going to make a mistake...like when designing a better memory-aid spell based loosely upon her &quot;want it need it&quot; spell at the behest of the looping Big Mac. The basic premise was simple enough: if you were interested in something, it was easier to remember things about it.</p><p class="double">It was noon, <i>Tuesday</i>, when she passed out.</p><p class="double">Applebloom nudged Twilight. Then all but kicked her. Then yelled in her ear. Twilight barely even stirred. </p><p class="double">&quot;Aww, I guess ah won&#039;t get my magic lesson...oh look! She left a spell for me to try on her desk!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.12 (fractalman)</p><p class="double">Winter in Sugarbowlquestria was brought about by grinding up plain sugar into a fine powder, mixing in some pegasus magic to make it extra soft, and blowing it across the land.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t forget to drink some hot cocoa&quot; said Twilight to Spike. &quot;You don&#039;t want to get too dehydrated.&quot;</p><p class="double">While the lungs of the sugar ponies were more than capable of absorbing the copious quantities of sugar in the air without choking, solid/liquid imbalance was possible, if uncommon. </p><p class="double">Five minutes later, Twilight felt she&#039;d had enough of watching Spike&#039;s antics from the sidelines, and joined in the fun, leaping and rolling about in the curious substance-which was somewhere between snow and clouds-like a filly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dear Twilight</p><p class="double">How would you like to raise the Light Switch on the wall tomorrow?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dear Celestia</p><p class="double">Sure! </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.13 (banjo2E)</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle Awoke reading a book.</p><p>This wasn&#039;t an unusual event,</p><p>but she could swear that something was amiss.</p><p>It did not take long for her to decide</p><p>that reading the book would provide a base</p><p>of knowledge from which to proceed further.</p><p>With that in mind, she turned to chapter one</p><p>and started to read.</p><p class="double"><i>Once upon a time</i></p><p><i>in the magical land, Equestria,</i></p><p><i>two regal sisters ruled in harmony.</i></p><p><i>The elder sister raised the sun at dawn;</i></p><p><i>the younger, likewise, with the moon at dusk.</i></p><p><i>Thus did the sisters maintain their kingdom</i></p><p><i>and safeguard their subjects, the pony folk.</i></p><p class="double"><i>But as the years went on, the younger mare</i></p><p><i>became resentful of her sister&#039;s rule.</i></p><p><i>The ponies loved her sister and the day,</i></p><p><i>but shunned her and slept through the beauteous night.</i></p><p><i>These thoughts culminated one fateful morn,</i></p><p><i>when she refused to lower the moon at dawn.</i></p><p><i>The elder sister tried diplomacy,</i></p><p><i>but the younger&#039;s bitterness had transformed</i></p><p><i>her into the monstrous mare, Nightmare Moon.</i></p><p class="double"><i>The Nightmare vowed to dethrone the sun mare</i></p><p><i>and shroud the land in never-ending night.</i></p><p><i>Thus was her sister forced to call upon</i></p><p><i>the most powerful magic ponies know:</i></p><p><i>The sacred Elements of Harmony.</i></p><p class="double"><i>The Elements defeated Nightmare Moon</i></p><p><i>and locked her in the moon forevermore.</i></p><p><i>The sun mare took responsibility</i></p><p><i>for both the sun&#039;s and moon&#039;s heavenly paths,</i></p><p><i>and harmony has been maintained within</i></p><p><i>Equestria for generations since.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle finished reading the page,</p><p>blinked, read it again, then brought hoof to face.</p><p>She closed the book and pondered for a time,</p><p>then shrugged, saying &quot;At least it doesn&#039;t rhyme.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">123.14 (fractalman)</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity!

<p>124.1 The Great Elevator Saga:</p><p class="double">(Gamerex27)</p><p class="double"><i>Another century, another Lonely Loop</i>, Twilight thought glumly.</p><p class="double">It had been her first one in a while, too: recently, she had a windfall of Fused Loops lately: aside from her horrific visit to the God Emperor of Mankind, they had gone well (although Awake Fluttershy muttered something about a &quot;poor kid&quot; when they Element-blasted a Bureau-Celestia last decade).</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been trying to keep things baseline for a while: for the most part, it was successful. She&#039;d just reached the point where Fluttershy had redeemed Discord, and the Element-bearers decided to celebrate with a sleepover at Rainbow Dash&#039;s apartment. This looked like a slight variant: instead of medieval technology supplemented by magic, this Equestria Variant ran off of nuclear-level technology and magic. Twilight was still annoyed that those crystal ball phones/computers were all the rage in this Loop, yet when she tried to make her own, one simple spam e-mail ruined the whole network.</p><p class="double">&quot;What floor did you say you were on, dear?&quot; Rarity asked, looking up at the tower that was about the size of Mount Everest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seven hundred. Don&#039;t worry, that elevator goes really fast,&quot; replied Dash. &quot;Not as fast as me, but not bad, anyways.&quot;</p><p class="double">A few minutes later, they had all piled into a surprisingly roomy elevator car. The doors closed in front of them, and only then did Twilight notice something very distressing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, girls?&quot; Twilight said, pointing at the buttons with her forehoof. &quot;We&#039;ve got a problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s-oh, <i>ponyfeathers</i>,&quot; Rainbow Dash swore, facehoofing. &quot;Some jerk <i>had</i> to push every single bucking button for <i>every single floor!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Can&#039;t y&#039;all just teleport us out?&quot; Applejack asked, nervously glancing around the car.</p><p class="double">&quot;They installed some kind of anti-magic field around the system. Safety measures, to stop any impatient unicorns from being crushed if they make a mistake teleporting,&quot; Dash groaned. &quot;Safety measures, my flank.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry!&quot; Pinkie said, bouncing over to the buttons. &quot;We&#039;ll just have to wait until we get to the top! Hm...the doors open for 30 seconds for every floor, and we&#039;re on floor two right now, meaning we&#039;ll get there in about...&quot; Pinkie&#039;s ever-present smile faltered for a moment. &quot;...6 hours.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;6 hours? SIX HOURS?!&quot; Rarity groaned. &quot;We&#039;re stuck in an elevator car for six hours?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we ain&#039;t gonna starve in here,&quot; Applejack noted. &quot;Ah&#039;ve got the snacks for the party in mah saddlebag, so we won&#039;t get hungry. Though, we&#039;ll probably be too tired when we get to Dashie&#039;s apartment to party...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The elevator is big enough to put the sleeping bags down..just barely, though,&quot; Fluttershy added in her usual whisper. &quot;Should...should we just have the party in here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YAY! Elevator slumber party!&quot; Pinkie pulled a party popper from out of nowhere, then pulled the string, sending streamers all over the cart.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s just hope that nopony needs to actually USE this elevator until we get there,&quot; Rainbow Dash grumbled. &quot;Here&#039;s floor number three.&quot;</p><p class="double">But instead of a hallway, the ponies saw something <i>strange</i> on the other end.

<p>125.1 (novusordomundi)</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright Alright!&quot; Vinyl Scratch yelled into her mic. She was currently speaking into her microphone, doing her job as a radio DJ this Loop. While it wasn&#039;t as cool as just spinning tunes in various clubs and parties, it did allow her a few perks. &quot;I&#039;m still holding tickets to Mistress Z and Iron Will&#039;s concert here in Canterlot in my very hooves! And they will go to the fifth pony who calls in.&quot; However, in these types of Loops, is was usually Octavia who was her co-host. However, this time someone different was with her.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not going to try calling in yourself, are you, Vinyl?&quot; Twilight Sparkle teased. Instead of a Librarian this Loop, she was more into radio. In fact, she&#039;d been listening to the legend about the Mare in the Moon when she Awoke, instead of reading about it. She had to admit, she was having a lot more fun than she would have thought.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, I only did that once!&quot; Vinyl jokingly protested, before a laugh escaped her lips. &quot;Anyways, let&#039;s put on &quot;Nature of Reality&quot;, the new hot single from Sweetie Belle&#039;s upcoming album! And when we come back, we&#039;ll let you know who won those tickets!&quot; </p><p class="double">As the &quot;On Air&quot; sign stopped glowing, as a slow beat started to kick in. &quot;So, how long has Zecora been rapping for?&quot; Vinyl asked, taking the headphones off of her head. &quot;First time I&#039;ve been Awake and heard about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paused for a moment. Then she said &quot;I think it&#039;s been about four or five Loops. She picked it up during a Fused Loop, and decided to keep it as a hobby. It&#039;s made for some interesting shows. I think I&#039;ve got a video of her and Trixie performing in a rap battle somewhere in my Pocket...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mrs. Sparkle? Miss Scratch?&quot; An intern unicorn came in to the studio, a piece of paper telekinetically following behind him. &quot;A &quot;Derpy Hooves&quot; from Ponyville accidentally called here while trying to get take-out. But she was the fifth caller, and she did want the tickets...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.2 (fractalman)</p><p class="double">&quot;Once upon a time, two sisters ruled over Equestria&quot; read Twilight in the most annoying voice she could manage, in an effort to make the story seem interesting again. </p><p class="double">&quot;The older sister raised the sun by swimming under it, while the younger sister raised the moon by jumping over- wait what?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>...by jumping over it. But one day the younger sister became jealous of the older sister&#039;s fiddle-playing cat, and so turned into Nightmare Moo. In her panic, the older sister banished the younger with the most powerful artifacts in Equestria, the Elements of Rhyme. Legend has it that three beings shall one day free her from her prison, but none can say which beings...&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Winona, Diamond Dish, and Silver Spoon barked, giggled, and cackled as they finalized their plans to help Nightmare Moo run out of the moon. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.3 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">Macintosh Awoke on Sweet Apple Acres. Specifically, near the back door coming off the kitchen.</p><p class="double">The familiar surroundings were about the only thing normal about it though.</p><p class="double">He shifted his weight, only just bringing himself out of a stumble. This was nothing new. Awakening mid-step was par for the course, even if he was typically in the south field. Most loops he had to restart the furrow he&#039;d been working on, but that was a minor inconvenience.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately his center of gravity was apparently further back this loop, so even though he managed to save his first step, the second sent Macintosh flopping head over hooves onto the half-door.</p><p class="double">Macintosh leaned there for a moment, chest resting on the lower, still-shut portion of the door. The edifice seemed taller than normal. He shook his head, trying to regain his balance. After a moment, he&#039;d cleared the dizziness enough to look around.</p><p class="double">What he saw poleaxed him for a full sixty seconds.</p><p class="double">The farm itself seemed normal, along with its inhabitants. Frieda May and the rest of the cows were in the dairy barn, getting their morning milking from Granny Smith. Winona was nosing around the hog pen, apparently tracking a wayward piglet. Supplies for the Apple Family Reunion bedecked the tables set up in the cleared area between the barn and the house. None of which was what had Macintosh, professional farmer, vocational all-weather help, amateur barkeep, and part-time Hulk on the fritz.</p><p class="double">Out there, in the south field, was a stallion with a straw-colored mane and bright red coat, plowing a furrow as straight as could be.</p><p class="double">Granny Smith&#039;s voice broke him out of his distant-stallion-beholding-and-potential-existential-crisis-provoking reverie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, y&#039;all wanna stop layin&#039; around on th&#039; door witcher mouth open like yer tryin&#039; ta catch flies and get yer sister up?&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh the Looper brought a hoof to his head as he listened. The rubbing motion he made was an attempt to dispel the headache he could feel coming on. All it actually accomplished was displacing a brown stetson.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah fewmets.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.4 (Gamerex27)</p><p class="double">As Twilight Awoke, she noticed that she didn&#039;t have a body. While this was rare, but not unheard of, it was the first time that she had just been a disembodied head.</p><p class="double">She opened the door to the shed she was lying in (although she seemed to be missing her horn this Loop, she had long since learned how to channel her magic through other parts of her body-in this case, her tongue). Then, text began to scroll across her vision.</p><p class="double"><i>1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Neighvada Desert had turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless ponies into zombies and had brought the Statue of Neighberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary unicorn horn Shura. When the great head of the magus, Twilight Sparkle, heard that the horn had fallen into evil hooves, she set off immediately for Manehattan. For only she possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical horn and free Equestria from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.</i></p><p class="double">The Anchor&#039;s disembodied head rocketed into the air, and, almost without thinking, flew all the way to Manehattan.</p><p class="double">She looked down at the city. At the undead ponies walking its streets. At the giant flying tanks and hands flying all over the city, smashing skyscrapers with wild abandon.</p><p class="double">As Twilight tried in vain to wrap her head (after all, she was nothing <i>but</i> a head right now) around what was happening, several of the hands broke off from the swarm to approach her. Opening her mouth, she shot a giant glass eyeball from her throat, piercing through the palms of the hands and tearing them all to pieces.</p><p class="double">She could do nothing but stare for several moments.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; she said to herself, as she flew deeper into the city, &quot;after this, I&#039;m going to have to have a <i>long</i> night at Mac&#039;s Bar.

Well might as well get started with the pranks.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Over the next couple days Twilight Velvet, mother of Twilight Sparkle, noticed something strange. Twilight was being fed but no one remembered giving her a bottle. Her diaper was being changed but no one remembered doing it. And sometimes Twilight was even being put to bed with no one doing it. And Twilight only cried when she, Nightlight or Shining Armor were right outside her room and every time the only thing she wanted was to be let out of her crib. Yes, something strange was happening in her daughter and she was going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p class="double">Velvet moved her typewriter into Twilight’s room; she wasn’t going to leave her daughter’s side until she figured out what was going on.</p><p class="double">About an hour later her daughter woke up and looked at her. Little Twilight’s horn lit up, which wasn’t unusual for unicorn foal. However a bottle of milk entering the room and heading straight for her daughter was. Little Twilight started sucking at the bottle.</p><p class="double"><i>Did Twilight just…? </i>thought Velvet.</p><p class="double">Little Twilight lifted herself up and changed her own diaper. When Twilight was done with the bottle it floated over to Velvet’s hoof.</p><p class="double">Velvet stared at her daughter. <i>What? I have heard of independent kids but that’s ridiculous. Oh, I know. This must be a dream I fell asleep in my baby’s room and I’m dreaming.</i></p><p class="double">Little Twilight levitated the finished pages of her mother’s book and a red pen and started poof reading.</p><p class="double"><i>Ok, now I know I am dreaming. There’s no way my one year old daughter is editing my book.</i></p><p class="double">Little Twilight put her mother book back when she was done and ascended and started flying around the room.</p><p class="double"><i>And now she’s an alicorn. Definitely a dream.</i></p><p class="double">“Mom, I’m home,” cried Shining Armor from downstairs.</p><p class="double">Twilight flew downstairs.</p><p class="double">“M-MOM!” Shining Armor galloped up the stairs. “Twily’s Flying!”</p><p class="double">Velvet left her daughter’s room. “I know dear. She’ll be back to normal when we wake up. I’m sure of it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It took Twilight Velvet a couple days to come to terms with the fact her daughter really was an alicorn. Now if she could just catch her phantom editor (There was no way she would believe that her one year old daughter was actually editing her book).</p><p class="double">Overall Twilight Velvet’s life was getting back to normal - at least until next week, when her daughter started speaking to Princess Celestia in old equis, a language that no one but Princess Celestia herself spoke anymore. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.6 </p><p class="double">(Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><b>... and the Rest Loop: Dragonshy</b></p><p class="double"><i>(Reminder: the &quot;And the Rest&quot; Loop has Twilight, Cheerilee, Ivory Scroll, Zecora, Angel, and Gilda Awake. The rest of the Mane Six, not Awake, are Element Bearers for the Loop. Twilight&#039;s previous Loop was so bad she doesn&#039;t want to talk about it, and she&#039;s declared a go-through-the-motions relaxation Loop. The other five Awake Loopers are gleefully abusing this.)</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What do you MEAN, &#039;condemned&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll ignored the blast of draconic outrage, which she could afford to do so long as it wasn&#039;t draconic flame. &quot;This cave has been declared unfit for habitation due to structural and hygienic defects beyond repair. Therefore it is scheduled for demolition, by order of the Housing Authority of Greater Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Unfit for-!&quot; The dragon snorted a large cloud of black smoke. &quot;IT&#039;S A CAVE! How can a cave be condemned? Is it insufficiently cave-y for you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; Ivory Scroll said, standing on her dignity, &quot;under the circumstances I must deny your certificate of occupancy and suggest you find an alternate place of residence.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I didn&#039;t apply for any certificate,&quot; the dragon growled. &quot;And what do you propose to do if I simply ignore you and move in?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Ivory Scroll put on her best offended look. &quot;Whatever happened to the legendary draconic concern for law and order?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This IS the legendary draconic concern for law and order.&quot; With thumb and foreclaw the dragon flicked the mayor out of his way, picked the enormous sack containing his hoard off the clifftop, and crawled into the cave.</p><p class="double">He was still in the process of arranging his bed of jewels and gold when the sound of beating drums echoed into the cave from outside. He poked his head out to see a zebra pounding on large tomtoms, wearing a garish wooden mask. &quot;Welcome wagon?&quot; he grumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;You have disturbed my ancestors&#039; burial place! Begone, or the consequences you shall face!&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon raised an eyeridge. &quot;Zebras don&#039;t bury their dead. And they don&#039;t live on mountains.&quot;</p><p class="double">The tomtoms stopped. &quot;Er... orphaned was I when but a filly. I was adopted by goats both gruff and billy.&quot;</p><p class="double">A voice from a cloud above hissed, &quot;Is that all you have?&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora looked up and said, &quot;To remove him I&#039;m trying...&quot; She bounded over the sweep of a large claw that crushed the drums into leather and kindling. &quot;... but I don&#039;t think he&#039;s buying!&quot;</p><p class="double">A second swat sent the zebra flying off the ledge. With an eagle&#039;s shriek, Gilda plunged through the cloud she&#039;d been lounging on and caught the falling zebra only about twenty feet down from the cliff edge.</p><p class="double">Satisfied that the new annoyance was gone, the dragon went back into the cave.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Gilda said, &quot;that&#039;s two down, one to go, since Angel didn&#039;t want any part of the bet.&quot; The griffin turned to Cheerilee and said, &quot;I hope you&#039;ve got something better.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, as a teacher I can only say,&quot; Cheerilee giggled smugly, &quot;watch and learn.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Demolition squad?&quot; the dragon rumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, on account of this cave being condemned,&quot; Cheerilee said. &quot;I&#039;m giving you fair warning that you&#039;ll probably want to be outside the cave in about two minutes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now listen, pony,&quot; the dragon grumbled, &quot;I came here for a restful little nap, and I&#039;m getting seriously annoyed by you pestering Equestrians. If you don&#039;t have something very good to show me, I&#039;m-&quot; The dragon&#039;s gaze turned from Cheerilee to the three new arrivals. &quot;And who are you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re the Cutie Mark Crusaders!&quot; the filly with the red bow in her mane chirped.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re on a crusade to find our cutie marks!&quot; the orange pegasus added.</p><p class="double">&quot;And we won&#039;t rest until we&#039;ve discovered our destiny!&quot; the unicorn finished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Girls,&quot; Cheerilee said, &quot;it&#039;s all arranged. Go right ahead!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS SPELUNKERS, YAAAAAY!&quot; The three fillies pulled out helmets, safety vests and more grapnels and ropes than anyone who&#039;d known them five minutes would feel safe about their possessing, and plunged off past the dragon and its treasure into the depths of the cave.</p><p class="double">The dragon watched the fillies vanish into the darkness, then turned his attention back to Cheerilee. &quot;Am I supposed to be concerned?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait for it,&quot; Cheerilee said. After a long four count, she turned and dashed for the cave entrance.</p><p class="double">Moments later the shrieks and giggles of enthusiastic fillies turned to shouts of dismay. Deep in the cave rocks began cracking and groaning. Things fell. Larger things fell. Even larger things fell, making loud booms in the depths that shook the relatively bright entry chamber where the dragon had set up residence.</p><p class="double">The dragon glanced up, spotted only two stalactites that might be annoying, and reached up and removed them, pounding them flat-side up into the cave floor for use as nightstands.</p><p class="double">In the depths of the cave, the sound of falling rocks tapered off into the occasional shower of gravel and the dismayed moans of miserable ponies.</p><p class="double">The dragon used a bit of flame to inspect the situation, found a long sapling log tucked in a corner by a prior occupant, poked around in the depths, and drew out three fillies covered in coal tar. He dropped the stick out the cave entrance, saying, &quot;You should probably wash that off them as soon as possible. The nearest shampoo is somewhere OFF MY MOUNTAIN!!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee looked at the three Crusaders, tangled in rope, covered in sticky toxic substances, and shook her head.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three large bags of bits dropped at Twilight&#039;s hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;What are these for?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Those three had a bet going and made me the judge,&quot; Gilda said, pointing a talon at the sheepish-looking zebra, teacher and mayor standing behind her. &quot;Who could get rid of the smoke dragon using no Looper abilities, just simple in-Loop talents? But they all failed, which means you should get that letter from Sunbutt this afternoon. So, since you&#039;ll have to deal with it as in baseline, I say you should win the bet.&quot; After a moment she coughed and added, &quot;By the way, he may be a bit grumpier than usual this time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right,&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;Thanks for that.&quot; As if getting a non-Awake Fluttershy up that mountain wasn&#039;t difficult enough already...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>and the Rest Loop: Look Before You Sleep</b></p><p class="double">&quot;So, all you did was assign Rarity and Applejack to opposite ends of town?&quot; Cheerilee asked Ivory Scroll.</p><p class="double">&quot;If they&#039;re not working together, they can&#039;t get on each other&#039;s nerves,&quot; the mayor nodded. &quot;So they either never bother Twilight at all, or else they meet at her place as friends, and things go swimmingly.&quot; Nodding to herself confidently, she added, &quot;Everything should work out perfectly.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, darling, your hooves are a fright!&quot; Rarity gasped, pointing to the mud encasing the earth pony&#039;s feet. &quot;Go rinse yourself off before you come in here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, it&#039;s pourin&#039; down out here!!&quot; Applejack gasped.</p><p class="double">&quot;No argument, shoo! shoo!&quot; Rarity demanded, pointing back out the door.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed as Applejack complied with ill grace, and she watched with silence as the garden hose outside took the apple farmer two falls out of three. When Applejack finally came back inside she was soaked through her coat, and her hat had lost its shape from the water soaked through every inch. &quot;Let me go get a towel,&quot; she said quietly, trudging off to the bathroom.</p><p class="double">Applejack looked at Rarity, who looked at Applejack. Both looked at the bathroom door.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, Twilight,&quot; Applejack said, walking over to the door and taking the towel that floated out to her, &quot;have we done somethin&#039; ta upset ya? &#039;Cause you seem really down in the dumps. I mean, more than ya usually are,&quot; she added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, yes,&quot; Rarity added. &quot;It&#039;s nice to have a quiet friend, especially after spending an afternoon with Pinkie, but you seem more... well... subdued than usual.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re gloomier than a pig who&#039;s just watched th&#039; last mudhole in th&#039; whole world dry up,&quot; Applejack agreed.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and flopped forward on a reading table, resting her head on her forehooves. &quot;I didn&#039;t want to talk about this,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#039;s too much I can&#039;t explain, and there&#039;s too much I don&#039;t even want to think about, much less talk about. But... long story short, not long before Princess Celestia sent me here for the Summer Sun Celebration, I went through some really unpleasant circumstances. One of the reasons I was happy to move here was to have a quiet place where I could recover... with my friends,&quot; she added with a tiny smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;What kinda un-&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s question was interrupted by a white hoof to the mouth. &quot;Darling, she said she doesn&#039;t even want to think about it,&quot; Rarity said.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, I never had friends back in Canterlot, aside from my brother and my foalsitter,&quot; Twilight continued. &quot;I&#039;ve certainly never had a sleepover. But just now, when I saw you two at the door, and how annoyed you were at each other-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Annoyed?&quot; Applejack cocked her head in confusion. &quot;Over a bit o&#039;water? It weren&#039;t that big a deal!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, she&#039;s right,&quot; Rarity said, looking abashed. &quot;I wasn&#039;t thinking about you at all, Applejack. You could have washed up in the bathroom. I&#039;m so sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I&#039;m not really in the mood for a party tonight anyway. Let&#039;s just have a quiet evening together, all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;A wet night calls for some comfort food anyway. Hot oatmeal with apples and cinnamon sound good?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Delightful, darling,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;I&#039;ll just check on Twilight&#039;s extra blankets and pillows.&quot;</p><p class="double">Outside, the rain poured peacefully onto the streets of Ponyville.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you were right,&quot; Cheerilee said. &quot;I hear Twilight had a nice, peaceful, pleasant evening with her two friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;So nothing went wrong...&quot; Cheerilee gestured to the greenery lying higgledy-piggledy around the inside of the town hall. &quot;Aside from a few loose branches, of course.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Topiary,&quot; Ivory Scroll groaned. &quot;Exquisitely crafted topiary. Two hundred and sixty-one pieces of exquisite unicorn-crafted topiary.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; Cheerilee nodded. &quot;Funny how, out of all the buildings in town, they only hit Town Hall.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll moaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;And based on a quick count,&quot; the teacher continued, &quot;they knocked out two hundred and fifty-eight windowpanes in the process.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll sobbed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Which, I suppose, would explain three of the seven holes in the roof,&quot; Cheerilee continued. &quot;But what about-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hai, Cheerilee!&quot; a cheerful voice called out from a large pile of styled tree branches. &quot;Did you come to help clean up too?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, hello, Derpy,&quot; Cheerilee called back, all her questions answered. Still, to be polite, she asked, &quot;Do you know how this mess got started?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really,&quot; Derpy replied, shaking her head. &quot;Rainbow Dash kept the wind blowing west-to-east during the storm, and she sent me home to take care of Dinky when it started. It looks like the streets funnelled all the loose branches the wind picked up straight into town square.&quot; Her crossed eyes crossed slightly more in helpless confusion. &quot;I don&#039;t know which pony was in charge of tree cleanup on the west side of town.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I do,&quot; the mayor of Ponyville wept into her ascot. &quot;Ohhh, I do...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.7 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Nyx blinked and examined herself as she Awoke. Human, or something close, again with dark skin (frankly it amused her how her human skin tones tended to flip between either really pale or as dark as was naturally possible). Moving on, she was walking in the middle of the woods, carrying a basket, headed to her grandmother Twilight Velvet&#039;s writing cottage to bring her some food (because apparently her grandmother frequently forgot to take enough supplies when she got inspired). Oh, and she was wearing a red hood and cape combo over her other clothes.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Well, this is interesting,&#039;</i> she thought to herself as she looked around expectantly. <i>&#039;Wonder if anyone replaced the Big Bad Wolf?&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Almost as it the thought had been a cue, she heard a deep masculine voice begin singing.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Who&#039;s that I see walkin&#039; in these woods? Why, it&#039;s Little Red Riding Hood!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Turning to the direction the voice came from, she beheld a tall muscular werewolf wearing plate armor and grinning cheekily in her direction.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Hey there Little Red Riding Hood! You sure are looking good!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Nyx couldn&#039;t help herself. She began giggling hysterically, interrupting the song. &quot;Hey Lemon!&quot; she managed to get out between giggles. &quot;How&#039;ve you been?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not bad,&quot; the werewolf, also known as Leman Russ, as well as Lemon Rush to the Equestrian loopers, allowed. &quot;Just saw you walking through the woods and wondered if you could use some company.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably,&quot; Nyx grinned back. &quot;After all, there could be any number of dangerous beasts lurking out in the woods that might attack a poor defenseless little girl out to take goodies to her poor old grandma&#039;s place! Why, if there wasn&#039;t a big strong escort around for defense, who knows what might happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">Leman Russ tried to hold it in, but the deep, rumbling laughter broke out anyway. &quot;And would I be protecting you from them... or them from you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Depends...&quot; Nyx tapped her chin playfully. &quot;Are you going to finish your set?&quot;</p><p class="double">Leman laughed again, shaking his head as he walked up to join Nyx on her trip through the woods. <i>&quot;You&#039;re everything a big bad wolf could want...&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Nyx tilted her head back and joined Leman with an echoing <i>&quot;Owoooooooo&quot;</i> before they both devolved back into laughter.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.8 (fractalman)</p><p class="double">Fluttershy gasped as she saw the state of angel bunny; fur was stretched tight across his chest, showing the bones beneath, and one of his eyes was missing. &quot;Oh, Angel, you poor thing!&quot; She moved to comfort him...</p><p class="double">Then he bit her hoof. Hard. &quot;Ow! ANGEL! You bad, bad bunny!&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel just gave her the finger and hopped off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Angel! That&#039;s rude!&quot;</p><p class="double">At least it meant Angel wasn&#039;t suffering, despite appearances to the contrary.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">*knock knock knock*</p><p class="double">Twilight opened the door to find Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh hi Fluttershy! What&#039;s up?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, well...&quot;</p><p class="double">To illustrate, Fluttershy&#039;s right eye fell out of its socket, only to dangle by a nerve bundle.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Let me guess. Angel bunny bit you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. &quot;How&#039;d you know?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to reveal a skeletal tail. &quot;That little rodent has been going around biting everypony for a couple days now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s left eye widened. &quot;Oh, my. I hope everypony&#039;s OK...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WOO HOO!&quot; yelled Spike, flying down the stairs. &quot;Check it out, Twilight! I&#039;m a skeletal wyvern!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. &quot;Some of the ponies are a little creeped out by the changes, but yeah, we&#039;re fine.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.9 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stumbled as she Woke up mid-step and rolled her eyes before taking stock. You&#039;d think she&#039;d have gotten the hang of a smooth gait after the first few million times it had happened, but she supposed there really were some things that you never outgrew.</p><p class="double">Looking around, she found herself-</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re walking in the woods,&quot; a voice informed her, seeming to come from the air itself. &quot;There&#039;s nopony around and your magic is dulled.&quot;</p><p class="double">She suppressed a groan. There were a hoof-full of decent narrators across the cosmos, but by and large they were a bad sign. A quick test of her horn confirmed that she could just about manage levitation. The rest of her abilities were just as sluggish.</p><p class="double">&quot;Out of the corner of your eye you spot her...&quot; Twilight barely caught the motion and was startled when a second voice chimed in with-</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Sapphire Shores.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s following you, about thirty feet back,&quot; it went on. Twilight found herself hurrying her pace just a little. &quot;She lowers her head and starts to gallop. She&#039;s gaining on you!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Sapphire Shores.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Twilight broke into a run as she tried to sort things out in her head. Getting run down by celebrities was hardly new. The Loops were more than happy to stick her with &#039;ponies are the deadliest game of all&#039; on occasion. Slasher scenarios happened often enough, and narrators were only a little rarer. All three at once was a new one, though.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re looking for the road, but you&#039;re all turned around. She&#039;s almost upon you now and you can see there&#039;s blood on her face. Sweet Celestia, there&#039;s blood everywhere!&quot; She suppressed the urge to upchuck as she caught sight of red all around her. To Tartarus with <i>this</i> mess, she was ending things then and there.</p><p class="double">&quot;Running for your life!&quot;<i>-&quot;From Sapphire Sh-&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Nope!&quot; Twilight shouted, turning back and running straight at the ponicidal pop sensation. This was somehow turning into a Heart Song, which meant she&#039;d have to act fast to shift the narrative momentum.</p><p class="double">&quot;Turning back to fight!&quot;-<i>&quot;Sapphire Shores!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s rearing back to strike you!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Musical mastermind, Sapphire Shores!&quot;</i> Twilight dove under her opponent&#039;s flailing forehooves before throwing herself upwards. Her horn drove into what she knew to be a sensitive nerve cluster just beyond the shoulder.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ve got her on the ropes!&quot;-<i>&quot;Sapphire Shores!&quot;</i> She continued her assault, dusting off disused martial arts to knock the musician off balance.</p><p class="double">&quot;But she doesn&#039;t give up hope!&quot;-<i>&quot;Sapphire Shores!&quot;</i> Sapphire continued fighting even as she hit the dirt. Her scrabbling hooves managed to strike Twilight a few times, leaving bruises and scrapes. Twilight, in turn, hefted a log in unsteady telekinesis and brought it around to strike her attacker across the back of her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Finally defeated!&quot;-<i>&quot;Safe at last from Sapphire Shores...&quot;</i> Twilight heaved a sigh of relief as the other pony&#039;s eyes rolled up and she slumped to the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright,&quot; she muttered, pacing as she unravelled the constraints on her magic. &quot;Am I teleporting you to jail or a psych ward?&quot; She wished Spike was there. Her own Legilimency was competent, but more intrusive than she&#039;d like.</p><p class="double">&quot;But she&#039;s only playing dead!&quot;-<i>&quot;Shores surprise!&quot;</i> The other mare leaped to her hooves in a lightning fast motion. &quot;She&#039;s got a knife in her hoof!&quot;-<i>&quot;And death in her eyes!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on!&quot; Twilight growled. Narrators were the <i>worst</i>. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.10 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia noticed her hoof tapping on the marble floor and forced herself to stop. Twilight Sparkle hadn&#039;t responded to her ping upon Awakening (nopony had), and she hadn&#039;t sent the usual &quot;help help Nightmare Moon is coming&quot; letter. One or the other always happened, without fail, in the first ten minutes of a baseline Loop. What was going on?</p><p class="double">She had almost decided to go looking for her student when Twilight Sparkle appeared in a flash in front of her. The purple unicorn shook like a willow tree in a tornado. &quot;Twilight,&quot; Celestia asked, &quot;what&#039;s wrong?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Big Mac and Berry Punch aren&#039;t Awake and nobody else is but you and this Loop doesn&#039;t have alcohol and I-I-I...&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia wrapped Twilight in one wing. To one of the guards at the door to her throne room she said, &quot;Cancel all audiences and public events for the day. All of them. We shall be busy.&quot; Before the guard could protest, she teleported herself and her student to her bedchambers, where Celestia&#039;s personal student could cry on her shoulder as much as she needed to.</p><p class="double">For the better part of half an hour Celestia just hugged Twilight and let her cry. Her mind flooded with questions- what Loop could have been this bad, that it completely shattered an Anchor this experienced?- but she kept her silence. If Twilight wanted to talk, she would. If not, Celestia would be there for her. True, their relationship wasn&#039;t what it once was, in baseline. Twilight no longer needed a mentor, and she had several friends closer than Celestia. But Celestia was still her friend, and would always be so, as long as Twilight Sparkle- Looping or not- needed her.</p><p class="double">Finally, long after the sobs had ended and the sniffles had dried up, Twilight spoke. &quot;What do you think would happen,&quot; she said, &quot;if someone inverted a Bureau Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia frowned, an expression all the more impressive for how seldom she used it. The Conversion Bureau. Not the absolute worst variant Loop Equestria had to offer, but none of the worse variants happened more than once, whereas the Bureau popped up again and again, like a wormy apple in the bobbing tank. &quot;Under any other circumstances I would guess it was a good thing,&quot; Celestia said cautiously. &quot;People imprisoned in bodies they weren&#039;t born in and didn&#039;t want, released and returned to the lives they were meant to live.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight snorted like a donkey. &quot;Not even close,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Human scientists were conducting an experiment in travel to alternate dimensions. They opened a portal onto Equestria. For a little while everything seemed to be perfect- peaceful first contact, cultural exchange, the start of friendship between the two species.&quot;</p><p class="double">When Twilight paused for reaction, Celestia replied, &quot;But the portal did something to poison Equestria, didn&#039;t it? Something requiring Conversion?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shuddered. &quot;Once the portal was established it was harmless. But the initial experiment that opened the portal tainted the mana field across Equestria. Anything that used magic would gradually be poisoned and die from the exposure. And since Equestria relies on magic for practically everything...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Everypony would have to migrate to Earth,&quot; Celestia said. &quot;I begin to see where this is going.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ponies could live on Earth as ponies,&quot; Twilight continued, &quot;but that Earth had its own magic field, tainted even more so than Equestria&#039;s. We tried closing the portal, but closing the portal didn&#039;t take away the taint from Equestria&#039;s magic. So eventually it came down to one solution: convert every talking creature in Equestria into a creature that couldn&#039;t touch magic in any way, that would be immune to the taint. Humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see,&quot; Celestia said. After a moment&#039;s thought she added, &quot;And I asked you to be one of the first ones converted, didn&#039;t I?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. &quot;You and Luna were too far gone by that point, you said- too much magic, too much poisoning to survive conversion. I was supposed to take your place and lead the ponies to safety on Earth... in a world they didn&#039;t understand, a world that worked like the worst horrors of the Everfree Forest, a world without any of the wonders or miracles we take for granted.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So what did you do?&quot; Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I said no,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;You cajoled me and I said no. You called to my sense of duty, and I said no. Then you got on your knees and pleaded, begged me to accept conversion so I would live.&quot; Twilight sniffed again and pressed herself a little harder against Celestia. &quot;I think it wouldn&#039;t hurt so much if she&#039;d acted more like the usual Bureau Celestia and tried to take the decision out of my hooves, but she wouldn&#039;t do that. She was basically you. She did everything she could except force me to be converted. But she would- not- give- up!&quot; After a shuddering sigh she finished, &quot;I eventually teleported myself into solid rock to crash the Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Uh-oh,</i> Celestia thought but carefully didn&#039;t say aloud. As a rule of thumb, deliberately crashing a bad Loop tended to land the Loopers involved in a worse Loop. But not always. &quot;And you ended up here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. Minecraft,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;That didn&#039;t last long, because I couldn&#039;t concentrate on mining and building. I kept wondering... did I do the right thing? I mean, the Loop crashes when the Anchor dies... but what if there was another Anchor in that Loop? Did I just condemn all Equestria to a lifetime of leaderless exile without magic? Could I have found some way to purify the magic field if I hadn&#039;t given up?&quot; Twilight looked up at Celestia and whispered, &quot;Could I have saved you and Luna?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia hugged Twilight again. &quot;My dear Twilight,&quot; she said, &quot;you made the best decision you could at the time. Sometimes the Loops are just cruel, and nothing we do can change that, no matter how hard we try.&quot; A small smile crept on her lips. &quot;Remind me to tell you about the Loop where my chosen student was Jack Napier... and he had to save Equestria from the dreaded Batmare.&quot;</p><p class="double">This teaser served its purpose, which was to break the mood completely. &quot;What? But... how? PLEASE tell me the Joker isn&#039;t Looping!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Another time, Twilight,&quot; Celestia chuckled. &quot;I think we both need a vacation Loop. Why don&#039;t we go tell Nightmare Moon the throne is hers, and see how long it takes for her to beg us to come back?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Surfing again?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, I was thinking Maneaco. Roulette and baccarat in a city that never sleeps. Incognito, of course. And with the Equestrian treasury for mad money.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I&#039;ve been working out this new system for card-counting at blackjack that I&#039;m almost certain the casino won&#039;t be-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s words were cut off as the two ponies teleported away.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.3 continued (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">When the ping came, he almost missed it.</p><p class="double">Macintosh Apple, elder brother, professional farmer, amateur barkeep and looper, in that order, rubbed at his forehead with a hoof. Massaging the bridge of one&#039;s nose was a comfort limited to the loops where he had fingers, and a nose for that matter. It was one which he had not managed to bring back to his equine form, and was sorely missing at the moment. So, in lieu of such action, he continued rubbing at his forehead with a hoof.</p><p class="double">An outside observer would see something quite different. Another pony, or similar narrator more focused on the physical reality, such as the two green eyes peering into the mirror, would say Applejack was massaging her forehead. For that was the name tied to the body currently ensconced in a bathroom on Sweet Apple Acres, as it had been for a good five minutes while the mind currently possessing it sorted out the disorientation of waking up somewhere unfamiliar.</p><p class="double">Macintosh, on the other hand, saw no reason to bow his internal pronouns to the whims of something so capricious in the Loops as Fact. So he massaged his forehead.</p><p class="double">There hadn&#039;t been a loop this... disorienting, since That One Loop with Twilight. Which had at least been bearable by dint of not giving him time to think over the changes until after Discord had been vanquished. By that point he had more important concerns, like forging a nation and keeping a religion devoted to him from getting too silly.</p><p class="double">It occurred to him that there were duties that needed to be done, here and now, and that his family would be missing the fourth member if this anti-headache session went on much longer, but the idea of interacting with the rest of the clan as Applejack, simply galled too much in his mind.</p><p class="double">A loop memory bubbled to the surface. Breakfast. It was familiar, one of the fresher memories whenever he Awoke. His sister always made hazelnut pancakes. But the memory was wrong too. He could remember making hazelnut pancakes. Thoughts accompanied images and actions, sounding like Applejack being there, whispering in his head.</p><p class="double">He tried listening for a moment. &#039;Gotta grind these nuts good an&#039; small. Granny Smith can&#039;t take the big chunks, get stuck in her dentures. Maybe I should make a separate batch for her, I like &#039;em, and Big Mac prefers-&#039;</p><p class="double">Mention of his name shot him back to the present, and his eyes widened, and then clenched shut as he strained at the corners of his mind. More loop memories tried to burn their way to the surface, but he held them down with a green-tinged extension of his will until they subsided. He let out a sigh of relief, and returned to regarding &quot;his&quot; reflection.</p><p class="double">What looked like Applejack continued to scowl at him through the bathroom mirror, reinforcing his conviction. Making him all the more determined to repress those thoughts from before he awoke in this body. After all, one fact remained true:</p><p class="double">Those were not his memories.</p><p class="double">Granted, there were many loop memories that he&#039;d seen that were not his. Every time he looped somewhere other than the Apple farm, he got a set that weren&#039;t his. These memories, however, weren&#039;t just not his.</p><p class="double">They were Applejack&#039;s.</p><p class="double">Who knew what kinds of private moments and thoughts were held therein?</p><p class="double">&quot;Sis? Y&#039; okay in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">The voice from outside made him stiffen. That wasn&#039;t Applebloom or Granny Smith. Didn&#039;t sound like them anyway. The male relatives wouldn&#039;t arrive until later, unless this was a stranger variant than he&#039;d thought. That left only one candidate. One he was not ready to face.</p><p class="double">Then the Ping hit.</p><p class="double">He cleared his throat, feeling the unfamiliar vocal chords. A tiny psychic poke at the back of his mind was the least of his problems. Despite the strangeness of using it, the voice sounded perfectly natural to him. Which could not be less normal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah&#039;m fine, jus&#039; don&#039; feel like mahself.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a grunt from outside, and then a receding set of hoofsteps as Macintosh moved away.</p><p class="double">&#039;That&#039;s going to get confusing quick,&#039; the looper thought to himself as he pinged back. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.11(DrTempo)</p><p class="double"><i>Another Loop here at Canterlot High...</i></p><p class="double">Sunset Shimmer was, as you&#039;d expect by now, tired of high school. The &#039;Dazzlings incident&#039; did change things up a bit, but even their tricks got stale. The teacher then mentioned two new exchange students, and that got Sunset&#039;s attention. <i>Five bits it&#039;s guest Loopers. </p><p></i></p><p>&quot;...Please welcome Pound Foolish and Blue Thunder.&quot;</p><p class="double">The latter, a young man with blue skin, bowed. &quot;It is an honor to meet you all. I hope we can get along.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pound Foolish, a young woman, then said, &quot;Pleased to meet you all! Hope you&#039;ll get us in the Loop about this place!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset knew that familiar sign, and quickly used a Ping, getting responses which were presumably from the new students. Raising her hand, Sunset said, &quot;I&#039;ll show them around!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A few minutes later, the new students were in the gym, when Sunset pointed to Pound Foolish and inquired, &quot;You&#039;re Nabiki Tendo, right? And by his name, your friend is...I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m saying this...an Awake Tatewaki Kuno?&quot;</p><p class="double">The revealed Nabiki nodded. &quot;Correct. Ranma told me about you. Heard you replaced me when you met him. Hope he taught you as well as he did me back during the early days.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset nodded. &quot;His teachings did help form my way of fighting. How DID you end up being the first Nerima Looper after him to Awaken anyway?&quot; Nabiki shrugged. &quot;He needed an ear to hear his problems, that&#039;s all, and didn&#039;t want to worry Kasumi. Even I was surprised when I started Looping.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset chuckled. &quot;Hard to believe the stories of how generous you are nowadays. So&quot;, Sunset pointed at Kuno, &quot;What&#039;s HIS story? When he&#039;d Awaken?&quot; Kuno replied with, &quot;Ranma befriended me one Loop where we had met during his training trip. He was there for me when my mother passed; I&#039;d likely fallen into my baseline habits otherwise. I happened to Awaken just as my baseline self was proclaiming his love for Ranma&#039;s girl form.&quot; </p><p class="double">Sunset cringed. &quot;Now that&#039;s gotta be embarrassing. So, what&#039;ve you been doing in the Loops, Kuno?&quot;</p><p class="double">The samurai wannabe replied, &quot;I have been trying to learn what it truly means to be a samurai. I have had a couple of Fused Loops which have helped. Allow me to demonstrate what I know, as little as it may be...&quot;</p><p class="double">Sunset grabbed a basketball, and said, &quot;Let&#039;s see it, then.&quot; </p><p class="double">Lifting his hand, Kuno used the Force to move the basketball. Sunset, intrigued, replied, &quot;A Jedi, huh. Their ways would fit you.&quot; </p><p class="double">Kuno then drew a sword, which Sunset could sense was a Zanpakuto. Saying, &quot;Strike, Ao Ikazuchi,&quot; the Zanpakuto&#039;s blade turned into pure lightning, and Kuno then sent it at the basketball.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Blue Thunder&#039;...” Sunset mused. “Why am I not shocked that&#039;s what that&#039;d be named?&quot;</p><p class="double">Kuno snickered, and when Sunset raised her eyebrow, then replied, &quot;I hope you meant that awful pun.&quot; Sunset facepalmed. &quot;I just realized it. Anyhow, welcome to this corner of the Multiverse, Kuno. Just don&#039;t try and hit on anyone.&quot; </p><p class="double">Kuno laughed mirthfully. &quot;What do you take me for? That buffoon whom I had once seen any day in the mirror?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nabiki shrugged. &quot;At least he&#039;s honest about it.&quot; The trio laughed. Sunset grinned widely. &quot;Well, welcome to Canter lot High. Hope you enjoy the experience!&quot; </p><p class="double">Nabiki nodded. &quot;We will.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.12</p><p class="double">“So, what did you dress up as for Nightmare Night?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Nyx shrugged. “Didn&#039;t. I just took my hairband off.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sniggered. “That, I admit, works.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.13 (with OathToOblivion)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, so... I <i>think</i> I&#039;ve got this down.&quot; The Smeargle sat down, toying with her tail idly. &quot;This is the Pokemon world, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Pikachu confirmed. &quot;It&#039;s kind of obvious.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, yeah, I don&#039;t play much. So... right. Why am I a Smeargle?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why wouldn&#039;t you be?&quot; Ash asked. &quot;Well, you might be a human, I guess...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I mean... look, I&#039;m a griffin, right? Why aren&#039;t I a griffin Pokemon?&quot; Gilda waved her tail around. &quot;I can see where it&#039;s coming from, I guess, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">Pikachu started to reply... and stopped. He turned to Ash. &quot;Do we even <i>have</i> a griffin Pokemon?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...now you mention it...&quot; Ash shrugged. &quot;Can&#039;t think of one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That sucks.&quot; Gilda shrugged. &quot;Oh well. Guess I may as well tag along with you butts. What do Smeargle learn, anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pikachu grinned. &quot;Good news! Anything they want. They copy moves.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Gilda&#039;s expression turned contemplative. &quot;Interesting. You guys run into Legendaries, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This could go either really well, or <i>really</i> badly,&quot; Pikachu commented to Ash, who nodded his agreement. </p><p class="double">&quot;Just to clarify, I get to keep the moves when I leave, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep,&quot; Ash confirmed, holding up his hand. A lazily-spinning Shadow Ball formed in his hand, while Pikachu spat out an Ember. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">125.14:</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Discord?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;Would you care to explain?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord shrugged. &quot;Explain what? All of this is above-board.&quot;</p><p class="double">He tapped the board to prove it, which made a wooden sound.</p><p class="double">&quot;More to the point, it is below my house.&quot; Twilight pointed at the large barrels. &quot;That one has a fuse. Why does it have a fuse?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord gestured to his comrade-in-legs. &quot;Ask her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora spread her wings, and coughed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember, remember,</p><p>the fourth season ender,</p><p>harmony, centaur and plot.</p><p class="double">If we blow your building</p><p>before Tirek escapes,</p><p>then - simply put - he can not.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very nice,&quot; Twilight said, and sighed. &quot;Have either of you had a stressful loop recently?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not especially, no...&quot; Discord replied. &quot;There is a good reason for this, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora nodded, and tapped the walls. &quot;These are treated with a potion. If made right, there will be no motion. The blast shall all go to the sky, and no danger for those nearby.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see.&quot; Twilight frowned. &quot;Right, just give me ten minutes to put everything I want to keep in my pocket and ascend.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ascend?&quot; Discord turned his head sideways in thought. &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight produced a large surfboard. &quot;I may as well see what Celestia sees in this, now I have the opportunity.&quot; </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
