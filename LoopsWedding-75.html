				<a name='53'></a><h3>Wedding part 1</h3>
<p>Twilight blinked Awake, and glanced over at Spike. He nodded at her with a grin, and briefly pushed himself an inch taller to show he was Awake.</p><p class="double">“Right, thanks,” Twilight said with a nod. “Let&#039;s see... two Honesty, one other Magic, both your Loyalty and Dash&#039;s... the other Elements are Awake as well...”</p><p class="double">A scrying spell appeared in front of her, flickering as she tuned it from location to location.</p><p class="double">Midway through the process, Nyx and Luna appeared in a burst of starlight.</p><p class="double">“Hi, Nyx,” Spike said, waving.</p><p class="double">“Art we chopped liver?” Luna asked, frowning.</p><p class="double">“Oh, and Luna of course.” Spike shrugged, earning him a playful glower.</p><p class="double">“Berry... Angel... and Mayor Mare,” Twilight concluded. “I think we&#039;re all here.”</p><p class="double">Spike raised a claw. “Does that mean-”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Twilight confirmed. “This loop&#039;s the big one. But first we need to sort you two out...”</p><p class="double">“I had an idea, actually...” Nyx grinned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Tremble in fear, mortals!” Luna-Nightmare boomed to the gathered ponies of Ponyville. “The Night Will Last Forever!”</p><p class="double">“Big sis?” a filly&#039;s voice piped from the backstage area. “Where did you put the crackers?”</p><p class="double">Luna let her hooves fall back to the stage, and turned. “Not <i>now</i>, Nyx,” she said in a strained voice. “I&#039;m busy.”</p><p class="double">Nyx pushed the curtain aside. “Sorry, but I want to have some crackers with my milk, and – oh, am I on stage?” She waved to the audience, some of whom waved back.</p><p class="double">“Stop it!” Luna punctuated that statement with a hoof-stamp and a wave of her wings. “You&#039;re messing with my big entrance!”</p><p class="double">“Oooohhh,” Nyx said slowly. “Sorry, I forgot about that. See ya later, sis!”</p><p class="double">Luna turned to the front of the stage as Nyx trotted off again. “Right. Now, where were we?”</p><p class="double">“Last forever,” Pinkie stage-whispered, beaming.</p><p class="double">“Right, thank you.” Luna raised her hooves again. “The Night Will-”</p><p class="double">“Can you heat the milk, please?” Nyx asked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, forget it.” Luna shrugged her wings. “I give up. Celestia can have it.”</p><p class="double">She flounced off.</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Sun emerged from the other side of the stage a few seconds after Luna had left. “Sorry I&#039;m late, I had to help my baby sister find some crackers. Now, shall we begin?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, your highness,” Mayor Mare said, looking a little uncomfortable. “It certainly worked. The main question I&#039;ve been hearing in my office is why nopony remembered that you and Luna had a younger sister.”</p><p class="double">Celestia nodded. “Good. I shall introduce Luna and Nyx properly in a few days, so as to make the populace as a whole thoroughly familiar with them.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” The Mayor frowned. “Your highness? Can we stop most of the catastrophes that would normally befall Ponyville? It&#039;s a little tedious clearing them all up.”</p><p class="double">“I believe we can prevent <i>most</i> of them,” Celestia temporized. “We may require Discord&#039;s rampage, however. That or the mirror...” she mused. “It bears further thought. But yes, I believe that such as the Parasprites and the Ursa may be prevented as much as is in our capacity.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike knocked on the door of the Rich household.</p><p class="double">You could tell it was a rich household because... well, for one thing it was a large and well-built house with grounds. For another, it had a number of tasteful and expensive sculptures visible.</p><p class="double">And the fact that a butler opened the door helped as well, of course.</p><p class="double">“Hi. Er... I wanted to speak to Diamond Tiara?”</p><p class="double">The butler nodded wordlessly, and did the Butler Vanishing Act.</p><p class="double">Spike walked in and sat down on a chair. To pass the time, he took out a cube with coloured squares on it.</p><p class="double">Each time he clicked one of the sides around, half the facets changed colour. It was something Twilight had made as a memory test – apparently it simulated seven-dimensionality.</p><p class="double">“Spike?” Tiara asked, coming down the stairs. “You here?”</p><p class="double">He stowed the cube. “Yeah.” With a furtive look back at the door, he walked over. “Did you finish it?”</p><p class="double">Tiara nodded. “Yep. Got it done a few loops ago, but I thought I&#039;d wait to deliver it until the Loop in question.”</p><p class="double">She pulled a box from her subspace pocket. “Here.”</p><p class="double">Spike took it, and opened it carefully for a quick peek at the glittering ring held within.</p><p class="double">It was made of a slightly bluish translucent material, which looked a little like the blue sheen one sometimes found on a metal absent the metal itself. The cap-stone surmounting it was a marquise-cut transparent diamond, set within a recessed heart-cut red gemstone.</p><p class="double">“Wow, that&#039;s impressive...” he breathed, closing the box. “So, how&#039;d you make it?”</p><p class="double">“Well.” Diamond paused, and motioned him into one of the receiving rooms.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, obviously I was flattered when you asked for my help making the ring,” Tiara began.</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged, a smile on his lips. “Asking Rarity was contraindicated, and fused loops are unreliable.”</p><p class="double">“And now I feel much less flattered,” she said with a smirk.</p><p class="double">The dragon threw up his arms. “A hit, a palpable hit.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway. I gave it a bit of thought, and the most important thing soon became clear. Durability.” She nodded at the box. “That ring is as close to invulnerable as I could make it, because it might be required to last as long as you both live – which, within the loops, is a very long time indeed.”</p><p class="double">“I see the logic.” Spike nodded. “So, first things first. The body of the ring?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s actually molecularly grown Corusca gem.” Diamond shook her head. “Took twenty years, on and off, to run the spell to grow it, because I wanted to eliminate shatterpoints and because I could only run it when I had time to Ascend without suspicion. If you&#039;re wondering, the reason it doesn&#039;t look like a fireworks display is something I&#039;ll get to later.”</p><p class="double">“Corusca gem? Oh, that thing Lando was working on.” The dragon paused, then let out an <i>oh</i> of realization. “That&#039;s actually pretty brilliant. My formative loop, very symbolic.”</p><p class="double">“Thank you.” Tiara grinned. “One of my better ideas. Okay, now, the bezel was grown integrally to microfractures induced in the larger stone, so they&#039;re all one piece – no weak point at the fastening. There&#039;s also a rim of corusca around the edge of the larger stone for redundancy.”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded along. “Again, very thoughtful of you.”</p><p class="double">“It must be my military background.” Tiara tossed her mane. “If it&#039;s impossible for things to go wrong, that&#039;s a good start.”</p><p class="double">“And the larger stone?”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ll like this.” She paused for dramatic effect. “That&#039;s the Heart Stone.”</p><p class="double">Spike blinked, reaching for the box. “I thought the Crystal Heart was-”</p><p class="double">“No, the heart <i>stone.</i> From that loop Twilight calls G1.” Tiara grinned. “I technically stole it... well, acquired it... and then cut it to suit. Which took another five years, but who&#039;s counting?”</p><p class="double">“You,” Spike pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Details. Anyway, given that it took an alicorn-powered version of a specialist gem cutting spell used by a gemstone-talent pony a <i>month</i> to make each facet, that should endure... well, anything. Even Discord&#039;s tender attentions.”</p><p class="double">At Spike&#039;s querying look, she elaborated. “It&#039;s made out of a powerful Harmony artefact. It&#039;s heavily resistant to chaos magic.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha. And the inner gem?”</p><p class="double">“Arkenstone.” Tiara waved her hoof self-deprecatingly. “Sweetie had some, she volunteered it...”</p><p class="double">“I start to see why it took so long.”</p><p class="double">Tiara shrugged. “It <i>was</i> an interesting challenge.”</p><p class="double">There was a moment of silence.</p><p class="double">“And the enchantments?” Spike asked, after a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right. Three types. The first is purely cosmetic – it&#039;s got a masking spell which absorbs ninety-eight percent of outgoing light until it&#039;s actually put on. When that happens, the masking spell drops, and it lights up like Corusca gems are supposed to.” Tiara flipped her hair with a hoof. “Just my little personal touch to the spectacle.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that will look cool.”</p><p class="double">“The second one...” Tiara frowned. “Well, I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s necessary, but I put it in anyway. That Oerth enchantment on rings which resizes them to the wearer.”</p><p class="double">“Never fear, that one&#039;s certainly going to get used.” Spike waved a claw. “There&#039;s been a few times I was the pony and she was the dragon, you know, and that&#039;s just for a start. Yeah, that&#039;ll have a use.”</p><p class="double">“Good.” Tiara flushed slightly. “It was less embarrassing than walking up to Rarity and measuring her horn, too... oh, the third category. Protective enchantments. Here... I kinda went nuts.”</p><p class="double">“Nuts is good,” Spike volunteered.</p><p class="double">“Right. So, step one is a trigger array which detects anything incoming with the prospect of even ablating away a single layer of atoms. I worked in precog to it, so it isn&#039;t limited by speed-of-light. Step two of the defences is a stasis layer, which sets up about two angstroms above the surface if step one is triggered. Step three...”</p><p class="double">Tiara went on for at least a minute, getting progressively more thorough, with impressive but perhaps slightly worrying paranoia.</p><p class="double">“...and then step fourteen is the last-ditch failsafe. If it detects that <i>all</i> of the above protections are going to fail, it automatically drops directly into Rarity&#039;s subspace pocket.”</p><p class="double">Spike blinked. “Back up. You designed something which can access the subspace pocket of another pony?”</p><p class="double">“Not... exactly.” Tiara waved a hoof. “It attunes to her when first put on, and from then it reserves a tiny bit of space for emergencies. The neat thing about the precog is – well, I tested it on a ring blank, and it does actually react to the loop reset by dropping back in.”</p><p class="double">The dragon absorbed that for a moment.</p><p class="double">“Thanks, then, Tiara. That sounds like you&#039;ve done me proud.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, don&#039;t mention it.” The filly shrugged. “Seriously. You two are the ones who&#039;ve helped me nurture both my special talent – in all its myriad interpretations – and my... little extra from Babylon Five.”</p><p class="double">Spike stowed the box in his Pocket with care, although he now knew that if he dropped it it was rather more likely for the planet to break than for that ring to be damaged. “Okay. Thanks anyway, though.”</p><p class="double">Tiara nodded to him, and sighed. “Imagine. A daughter of money, and my greatest work to date is in trade.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I don&#039;t think we ever actually discussed the issue of payment,” Spike mused.</p><p class="double">“Your word is good, of course,” Tiara said with a shrug.</p><p class="double">“No, I mean... if you&#039;re that worried about working in trade...”</p><p class="double">“Nice try.” Tiara gave him a look. “No, I&#039;m not going to do it as a favour. Next hundred fused loops, get at least one sample from each new kind of geology – uneaten, thank you!”</p><p class="double">Spike saluted. “Will do.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, and Smooth Service?” Tiara added, raising her voice. “This meeting never happened.”</p><p class="double">“Of course.”</p><p class="double">Spike jumped. “How did you do that?” he demanded, turning in his seat to look at the butler standing directly behind the armchair.</p><p class="double">In response, Smooth Service simply parted his hair to reveal a small horn.</p><p class="double">“Smooth Service&#039;s family have a kind of magic relating to quantum superposition or something.” Tiara shrugged. “I don&#039;t understand it myself – and I&#039;ve been trying – but, well, it&#039;s a valued talent among butlers.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{elmagnifico}</p><p class="double">Twilight trotted up to the bickering deities, checking off their names against a list from the Hub universe of diverse mythological beings. Urd and Peorth were there, the one obviously trying to break up the fight, the other alternating between helping Urd and egging on Hestia, of all deities, who looked ready to pull Ishtar&#039;s head off piecemeal. Osiris was dictating regally, his beard vibrating practically in Coyote&#039;s face. Cupid was hovering a little off to the side, looking smug and getting yelled at by Chang&#039;e about something or other. Sundry other gods, metaphysical embodiments, and other beings mingled, arguing about Yggdrasil-knew-what.</p><p class="double">Honestly, she was surprised Discord, Eris and Loki weren&#039;t there. Half the deities present weren&#039;t even associated with love. This whole situation stank of mischief.</p><p class="double">Not wanting the whole thing to get out of hoof, Twilight started channelling mana. At worst, these beings would ignore her, and if it worked...</p><p class="double">&quot;Mass hold person.&quot;</p><p class="double">...She could get them to all stop and listen to her, by dint of all being frozen in a purple aura. It was fortunate that apparently embodiments of Admins were at least allowing themselves at this juncture to be affected by in-loop effects, (probably to get pasted at the reception,) Twilight went into stern-without-offending-dangerous-subject mode.</p><p class="double">&quot;Erm, hi, hello. My name is Twilight Sparkle. Nice to meet you all. As you may or may not remember, I&#039;m the Anchor for this loop, and we consider it a sanctuary of sorts. I&#039;d much rather divine wrath not get flung around willy-nilly without good reason.&quot;</p><p class="double">Seeing as how a lot of the gods in her thaumaturgical net were still trying their best to look belligerent, she decided to put her hoof down just a little.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, if I remember correctly, the Yggdrasil framework runs on a Quadrig-7 style bureaucratic circuit, with a oxyrhomboidal pyramid referral and petition system going up from there?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight turned to Urd, releasing her from the purple stasis field as she did. Blond curls bounced as the goddess nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, if I were to file a form A-72B with Urd&#039;s office, along with Permit #838 with Balder&#039;s fourth undersecretary, there would be, as per circular B-65, a complaints application with forty-two copies needing to be signed and a teraflop of secondary forms for each of the involved parties.&quot;</p><p class="double">Purple lips spread in a smile that was only slightly threatening.</p><p class="double">&quot;I could give all of you a very large amount of paperwork to do.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ishtar&#039;s eye, the one that could face Twilight, swivelled to look at her and quiver angrily.</p><p class="double">&quot;Moreover, if any of this got up to the desk of the Allmighty, I&#039;m sure he&#039;d be most thrilled to hear so many of his subcontractors decided to bicker like a squadron of newly fledged seagulls, and at a wedding yet!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cupid rolled his eyes. Twilight chose to ignore him. He had, after all, chosen his 20th-century-influenced avatar, it was hard to take the little guy seriously.</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand, this is an auspicious occasion. It&#039;s not often something changes publicly and permanently in the Loops. You&#039;re all very excited. You want to be a part of it. But you&#039;re also ignoring the fact that the facilitator has already been chosen, and that going over the happy couple&#039;s head is liable to backfire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s smile faded just a bit.</p><p class="double">&quot;The truth of the matter is, the lot of you have, technically, missed the boat. If this gets too far out of hoof, Spike and Rarity will simply decide that the private ceremony they had earlier, which was recognized by several admins, will suffice. To avoid causing chaos amongst the Administrators, I think my friends would simply cancel the whole thing. Granted, there would be several people, myself included, that would be disappointed, but we wouldn&#039;t direct our ire at the happy couple. I feel, personally, that you&#039;d like to avoid that.&quot;</p><p class="double">What was left of her smile vanished like an icecube in Muspelheim.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because not only am I an anchor, and a close friend of both the prospective bride and groom, I&#039;ve made acquaintance with and share bonds to several other such beings, and along with my time in the Hub universe, I&#039;ve made quite a few comrades and companions. Friends, if you will, who wouldn&#039;t mind filling out one little form and maybe a permit, something that even their fellow loopers would be willing to do, were I to ask nicely. You lot might be above magic should you so choose to be, but friendship has a way of jumping metaphysical boundaries like no power can.&quot;</p><p class="double">And, just like that, the smile was back. The purple field dissipated, and before any of the deities could comment, Twilight was trotting off, a parting comment directed over her shoulder.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, I&#039;ve got arrangements to make for things we didn&#039;t already schedule. So many odd bits of the multiverse want their own contributions added to this ceremony. A traditional Fenrisian ice-ale sculpture, would you believe? You people play nice now, see you at the wedding!&quot;</p><p class="double">There was silence for a bit before Sun Wukong, who was being sat upon by Hera, commented.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hard to believe she&#039;s run by one of Loki&#039;s kids.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double">&quot;FILLIES AND GENTLECOLTS!&quot; A strange, mismatched serpentine creature floated over Ponyville. &quot;YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Giant glowing watermelons formed a collection of arrows in the sky, leading a confused populace to an inverted, hovering town hall. Everypony gasped when they saw what was beneath the floating building: a giant fishbowl containing eight ponies and a dragon! Murmurs rippled through the crowd as the strange entity walked down steps made of marshmallow waffles.</p><p class="double">&quot;How&#039;d he get a dragon in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s only a baby. I&#039;m more concerned about the mayor!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is... is that the Summer Sun Celebration overseer?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweet Celestia, the thing got Rainbow Dash! And her hermit friend from that cottage outside Everfree!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That dressmaker and the Apple girl... why both of them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie and Berry Punch? What could that creature want with them?&quot;</p><p class="double">With a very loud sigh, the chimeric serpent produced a cane made out of nerf and rapped the fishbowl twice. &quot;Ahem.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd of ponies quieted down.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now then. My name is Discord. In days long gone and far away, I reigned over all of ponykind and spread wonderful chaos from hither to yon, and sometimes backwards. Some ponies complained, and the two that complained the loudest were Celestia and Luna.&quot; The creature shrugged. &quot;They locked me in stone for... I don&#039;t know how long. But now, I&#039;M BACK!&quot;</p><p class="double">Various loud screams came from the crowd, and a few ponies even fainted.</p><p class="double">Discord tapped his chin. &quot;Strange thing was, though Celestia thinks she&#039;s better fit to rule then I am. So I cut a deal with her. I&#039;d take the current bearers of the Elements of Harmony, add in a few civilians, shake up the mix, and kick them out of reality. And if they made it back, I would let her keep the country. Seems fair, right? Hence, these ponies.&quot; A talon gestured dramatically at the imprisoned assemblage. &quot;So, without further ado...&quot;</p><p class="double">His lizard leg reared back, spun around five times, and then he slapped the fishbowl with his tail. It vanished in a puff of cream cheese.</p><p class="double">&quot;And now we wait! While we wait, I&#039;ll practice my evil laugh. YOU!&quot; He pointed at a random blue mare. &quot;Time me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, um, yessir...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AHhahHHAHAhahAHAhahaHHAhauAHahAUAHHAaOIAahahAHuah- -AhAahuahAAoiaoaahuaaHaihAoiAHioahoAIhaiohaHAheahaHaHaauah- -AHauauhahahuahAjhAAUPoaiuahAaYuaoAhaiaOhOAIhAoiaHiohoaiHo- -iAhaiOhHaAHAhAHAHhAhhAhAhAhaihahiahaiUAOauoHaihahhHat- -aHAHaYyAhAhatHhYHahAYHHAHAHABabHAHWHAWhwhWBHahhlaj- -AHhHAHahHAAAaAAIOIAUOHaHaAAAAHHahhohaoahhaoahiiahiuioha- -oishaohioahaaaahahhehaheahahehehehahaoiheuohaoihhaoihahheh- -ahahhchahehhahaoieihahoihaoihcoihaohahaoheiohoihohaoihvhahwo- -ihoahchoaihwiehoahahcoieah...&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord took a deep breath.</p><p class="double">&quot;...HFioedhlfkHFOIHZOhoahhauidhakjhsauiahahuhaihfeoia- -hhahahahehahhahhAhahahoaheuahhHAhAhayhAHahuheihuahakHaiuhe- -aehakheoahhHahaiheohieahaoheoaeh- -oahwhHAhaihiohaioahioahehaoiwhaiyaoiuahahHahahhahoahhahahaaaaaa!&quot;</p><p class="double">He smiled. &quot;How long was that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Three minutes, forty three seconds, two deciseconds, fourteen milliseconds.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YES!&quot; Discord&#039;s lion paw pumped the air. &quot;HALF MY PREVIOUS RECORD EXACTLY!&quot;</p><p class="double">Without warning, a portal formed next to him. The first out was a pony recognizable as the former sun celebration organizer... if she&#039;d taken a taste for latex and decided to brawl with tigers every other Wednesday. Right after her was Rainbow Dash, wearing some sort of armor that tripled her size and had shoulderpads as big as barrels. Berry Punch was the next one out, swaying slightly as she leaned on a strange primate-like biped wearing comfortable clothes and carrying a duffel bag. The dressmaker, now clad in bedazzling gems, rode a far larger dragon out after them. The crowd gasped as Mayor Mare came out, her mane entirely pink and cravat replaced by a shimmering green cloak and mask. When the Apple girl appeared, wearing a long cloak and a pair of complicated goggles, a few ponies noted the necklace of garlic and drew their own conclusions. And when a great yellow wolf hopped out before transforming into a pegasus, some ponies outright fainted. They missed the final arrival: Pinkie Pie, wearing a toga and blue shades and actually hovering above the ground as the portal vanished.</p><p class="double">There was a moment where everypony held their breath.</p><p class="double">Then the strange ape creature nodded. &quot;This is Equestria? It&#039;s very nice, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We spent twelve years trying to get back, Jenny.&quot; Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes. &quot;I think it&#039;d have to be a lot better than &#039;very nice&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, I only just got here, I need time to judge.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...&quot; The blue mare raised an awkward hoof. &quot;You&#039;ve... only been gone a little over four minutes...&quot;</p><p class="double">The latex-wearing unicorn sighed. &quot;Of course. Time dilation. Trust us, everypony, for us it was twelve years. Which reminds me...&quot; She turned to Discord. &quot;We&#039;re back. Celestia won. Put down town hall and get rid of the melons.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please,&quot; added the yellow pegasus. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How long were you gone?” Night Light asked, looking... <i>up</i> at Spike.</p><p class="double">“About, ooh...” Spike trailed off. “A decade, wasn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">“Closer to twelve years, dear,” Rarity replied.</p><p class="double">Night Light and Twilight Velvet turned to her. “<i>Dear?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Rarity blushed. “Spike and I have grown rather close over the years – the <i>twelve</i> years,” she added, shooting a look at Spike and making him grin and shrug, “that we were... well, away. He and I have saved one another’s lives many times, and...”</p><p class="double">Spike took over. “I love her.”</p><p class="double">“We love one another,” Rarity clarified.</p><p class="double">Twilight Velvet visibly realized something. “Twelve years. Right.”</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Spike said, grinning uneasily. “I&#039;m afraid you missed my eighteenth birthday – among others.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, back up.” Night Light looked across to the rest of the returnees, focusing on his children – Shining Armour having arrived from the palace as part of Celestia&#039;s entourage. “Does this mean that my daughter is now <i>older</i> than my son?”</p><p class="double">“In a word, yes,” Spike winced. “We all got a bit confused – and we&#039;re <i>really</i> glad it only went one way, so we didn&#039;t miss the time with you.”</p><p class="double">Rarity shuffled her hooves. “There&#039;s something else important, as well.”</p><p class="double">Velvet&#039;s eyes widened. “Wait. Are you two <i>engaged?</i>”</p><p class="double">“Did it about three months ago,” Spike confirmed. “That was... a stressful time, really. We weren&#039;t sure if we&#039;d ever get back, since we&#039;d been gone so long already, and after another narrow shave we decided we shouldn&#039;t leave it to chance-”</p><p class="double">“All this <i>we</i> business,” Rarity interrupted, smiling broadly. “You make it sound as though you didn&#039;t ambush me with a ring after that little incident.”</p><p class="double">“As I recall, you didn&#039;t exactly complain,” Spike riposted. “In fact, if memory serves, you literally jumped into my arms.”</p><p class="double">Night&#039;s lips were moving, as he looked between Spike and Rarity. “Er... not to be crude, but... the issue of size?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Spike nodded. “You haven&#039;t seen that yet. This is cool.”</p><p class="double">He closed his eyes, and shrank slowly. From so large that Rarity could use him as a mount, down to a little larger than Princess Celestia.</p><p class="double">Seeing his two sort-of-parents-it&#039;s-complicated staring, he put on a slightly failed attempt at a confident smile. “Basically, that&#039;s how. It&#039;s the most useful thing I learned while we were gone.”</p><p class="double">“To get back on topic,” Rarity said, picking up the conversation thread. “Now that we&#039;re back in Equestria, we can invite everyone we want to invite. To the wedding,” she added, finally saying the word itself.</p><p class="double">“When do you plan to have it?” Twilight Velvet asked straight away. “I&#039;ll make sure to keep the entire week free.”</p><p class="double">“Well... actually, we hadn&#039;t thought that detail through,” Spike admitted.</p><p class="double">Velvet frowned. “I see. Well, that&#039;s fair enough. What about a venue? Any thoughts on that?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was one of the most exhausting conversations I&#039;ve had for decades!” Spike said half an hour later. “I didn&#039;t realize Twilight&#039;s mom could be so devoted a wedding planner... I mean, she wasn&#039;t like this the first time.”</p><p class="double">“I think that&#039;s because we blindsided her with the time loops thing,” Rarity mused. “I hope <i>my</i> mother isn&#039;t so strongly focused on that side of things, or it could take a full hour to have that conversation.”</p><p class="double">“I think we know why Cadence and Twilight Velvet hit it off so well...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is... so strange,” Pearl said, looking Rarity up and down. “To think that you&#039;re now only about ten years younger than we are... you certainly don&#039;t look it.”</p><p class="double">Rarity shrugged, slightly awkwardly. “I kept in shape. We all did.”</p><p class="double">She looked over to Spike, who&#039;d been standing slightly back during the reunion. “Come on, Spike.” As the dragon approached, she looked at both parents. “Spike has something important to ask.”</p><p class="double">“Mister Belle,” Spike said, solemnly. “Would you do me the sublime honour of allowing me to take your daughter&#039;s hand in marriage?”</p><p class="double">Pearl gasped, her eyes darting to her daughter. Rarity gave a quick smile, winking at her mother.</p><p class="double">Magnum didn&#039;t react for a moment.</p><p class="double">“Rarity?” he said, quietly.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, Dad,” she replied, blushing. “I&#039;d have taken him to get to know you, but... you know... alternate universe, and all that...”</p><p class="double">“She told me a lot about you,” Spike contributed.</p><p class="double">“I should hope she told you a lot about both of us!” Pearl said, then giggled. “Or perhaps not – we might scare him away!”</p><p class="double">“Mother!” Rarity said, trying to hold in laughter of her own.</p><p class="double">“Okay, she&#039;s your problem now.” Magnum nodded briskly. “Pleasure to meet you, mister Spike.”</p><p class="double">Rarity turned to her father, frowning. “You don&#039;t <i>mean</i> that about me being a problem, do you?”</p><p class="double">“We love you, dear, but you could be two hoof-fulls and a horn as well!” Pearl teased. “Not every filly tries to redesign their graduation outfit because it&#039;s not fabulous enough...”</p><p class="double">Spike blinked. “I didn&#039;t hear about that.”</p><p class="double">“It was so long ago,” Rarity muttered, her blush deepening. “I&#039;d almost forgotten.”</p><p class="double">“Right, when&#039;s the wedding?” Magnum asked. “I want to know if I can attend, or if there&#039;s a game on.”</p><p class="double">Seeing Rarity&#039;s startled expression, he laughed. “Got you!” Then his expression softened. “Of course I wouldn&#039;t miss out on your wedding for a hoof-ball game.”</p><p class="double">Rarity rolled her eyes, looking imploringly at Spike. “See what I have to cope with?” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Filraen}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Shining, sorry!&quot; A pink alicorn threw herself to the Captain of the Royal Guard, Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">Trying to be the most tactful possible Shining answered as he raised himself from the floor &quot;What for, Caddie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Our wedding! It&#039;s almost time and I&#039;ve been so occupied with preparing things for Spike and Rarity&#039;s wedding next year. This time not even Chrysalis appeared to remind me!&quot; Cadence seemed very tired and almost on the verge of tears.</p><p class="double">Both his calm mind and experience as a Looper gave Shining Armor a quick getaway from this potential trouble. &quot;I have the next weekend free, how about we go to Las Pegasus and get married quickly there?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But out wedding...&quot; Shining placed a hoof on his wife&#039;s mouth to let him keep speaking.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve had... how many weddings? How many we&#039;ll have in the future? I love getting married with you every time but you&#039;re devoting your heart and soul to Spike and Rarity&#039;s this loop, a wedding which transcends Equestria itself.&quot;</p><p class="double">At Cadence&#039;s questioning look Shining Armor explained &quot;According to Twily, this is the first time two loopers marry permanently without being married in the baseline first.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s that big?&quot; Cadence tried to remove a very surprised expression from her face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Looks that way,&quot; Shining Armor tried to reassure his wife-not-in-name-yet-this-loop.</p><p class="double">After a moment, Cadence sighed. &quot;Sure, something small this time will do. When is your leave?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;After the Daytime Friday shift. After that I return on Tuesday.&quot;</p><p class="double">Imagining what she could have with a full long weekend with her husband (which still accounted to &quot;too little&quot; in Cadence&#039;s book), she gave a determined nod. &quot;Fine, I&#039;ll pick you up thenand we&#039;ll go to Las Pegasus to marry.&quot; And, with a laugh not out of place from Nightmare Moon, Cadence teleported away.</p><p class="double">Asking himself if he was going to survive his wife until the big wedding this loop, Shining Armor sighed. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double">&quot;Where have you <i>been?</i>&quot; Trixie squealed, pinning down the newcomer with what was either a grateful hug or an angry full body grapple. &quot;I&#039;ve been worried <i>sick!</i> Literally! In the hospital and everything!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, changeling politics this loop are complicated.&quot; Chrysalis sighed. &quot;A council of queens, we were all starving, total race superiority over &#039;prey....&#039; I had to assassinate three of my sisters just to shake things up, and after that there was the constant juggling of ever shifting alliances trying to control portions of the hive mind.... ugh.&quot; She smiled. &quot;But hey, I&#039;m here now, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Reluctantly, the magician released her grip. &quot;Fine, I guess that&#039;s a good excuse. You&#039;re still doing the honor guard for Rarity&#039;s wedding, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, is that this loop?&quot; The changeling queen grinned and rubbed her hooves together. &quot;Great! Hold on, I need to get, um, Cadance to do the whole Intro to Equestria bit...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There you go,” Fluttershy said, smiling. “That should fit you at that size.”</p><p class="double">Spike examined the newly-sewn suit. “Thanks, &#039;shy. You know, it&#039;s kind of helpful that you&#039;ve been studying so many loops.”</p><p class="double">“I wanted to be ready for... well... everything.” Fluttershy shrugged. “It&#039;s helped a few times, too, especially when I end up in the wilderness.”</p><p class="double">The dragon nodded. “I know the feeling. I&#039;ve had a few loops where I and a couple of others have to fend for ourselves.”</p><p class="double">He pulled gently at the shoulder. “Are these padded?”</p><p class="double">“A bit.” Fluttershy pushed down on them, letting them collapse down slightly and then spring back up. “I&#039;ve seen human suits do it, it seems to be a thing. And I don&#039;t really have a default pattern for biped suits.”</p><p class="double">She fussed slightly with the wing area. “I&#039;m afraid the only thing I could do for your wing shoulders, though, is to have them as... little sleeves in the suit. That means you&#039;ll have to either expand to your current size while wearing it, or furl your wings as completely as you can to get it off.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that should be fine,” Spike assured her. “I think I can drop the suit into my subspace pocket to get it off, and bring it out again to get it on.”</p><p class="double">“Oh... silly me,” Fluttershy said, blushing. “I don&#039;t normally use it for clothes, so...”</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s fine.” Spike waved his claws. “Really... oh, out of curiosity, what fabric did you use?”</p><p class="double">“Carbon nanoweave,” she replied. Seeing Spike&#039;s eyes widen, she smiled softly. “It&#039;s made of diamond, essentially. It seemed appropriate.”</p><p class="double">“Too right.” Spike stowed the suit with a mental nudge. “Thanks again, &#039;shy.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s no problem, Spike,” she stated. “We all want to make sure it&#039;s the best day it can be.”</p><p class="double">She waved him farewell as he left.</p><p class="double">Ten minutes later, a knock came at her door.</p><p class="double">Angel opened it so fast the hinges smoked, earning a warning look from Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">“Hi, &#039;shy,” Rarity said, standing on the step with a bundle of fabric. “I was wondering if you&#039;d be able to help me tweak this. I feel I need a second opinion.”</p><p class="double">“Not at all,” Fluttershy said, stepping back from the door.</p><p class="double">“I just... I want to make sure it fits, is all.” Rarity rubbed her hooves together nervously. “I&#039;ve never been so apprehensive in... <i>ever</i>, and it&#039;s making me doubt my own judgement.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, it&#039;ll be fine,” Fluttershy smiled. “I&#039;ll help you get it set up.”</p><p class="double">That she&#039;d be able to double check that Spike&#039;s suit and Rarity&#039;s dress would go together was a silent bonus.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double">&quot;That was.... exhilarating, actually,&quot; Mayor Mare finally managed. &quot;I had no idea these pranks could be so much... fun!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned, sipping down her cider. &quot;We&#039;ll make a proper looper out of you yet, filly! Now all we&#039;ve got to do is give you wings and a horn for a loop and get you swearing on plant parts.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wings and... oh, nononono.&quot; The other mare chuckled, waving a hoof. &quot;I don&#039;t think that&#039;ll be happening anytime soon. I couldn&#039;t possibly try to mimic the princesses like that!&quot;</p><p class="double">The party pony gave a deep sigh. &quot;And <i>that</i> is why you need wings and a horn. Oh well, we&#039;ve got time...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, darling, your mane is a lovely shade of fuschia,&quot; Rarity interjected. &quot;If you like, I could help you style it in a more... flattering manner?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, but... no. I prefer being seen as an old mare.&quot; The mayor smiled. &quot;Politicians do need to maintain a certain amount of respect!&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara snorted as she passed by. &quot;Old mare? Compared to us, you&#039;re essentially a filly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, have <i>you</i> ever had to handle the paperwork this crazy town generates?&quot;</p><p class="double">Tiara gave her a flat look. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor blinked. Then she sighed. &quot;Right. Time loops. I know this and...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s fine, really.&quot; Rarity smiled and patted her shoulder. &quot;It takes a while for everyone to adjust. We&#039;re all here for you if you need it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no, I can&#039;t ask that!&quot; Mayor Mare shook her head. &quot;This is your <i>wedding!</i> I&#039;ll be fine, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, Fluttershy is a lot better at this sort of thing,&quot; Pinkie pointed out. &quot;I mean, Lemon Rush, Chrysalis, Clearwater... She&#039;s like a friendship ninja!&quot;</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus smiled awkwardly. &quot;I was a ninja one loop. Actual ninja, mind you, not one of those super power chakra Naruto ninjas... it was an interesting experience.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare nodded. &quot;I can... tell, I didn&#039;t even hear you walk up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, well...&quot; Fluttershy turned to Pinkie Pie. &quot;Discord says he&#039;s ready on his end. Does... that mean anything to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">The grin that Pinkie responded with was one she&#039;d learned in her tenure as a chaos god. &quot;Oh... just a little surprise we whipped up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity narrowed her eyes. &quot;Surprise? Pinkie, please don&#039;t tell me you did what I think you did...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, Rarity, I won&#039;t tell you I did what you think I did.&quot; The party pony grinned. &quot;I&#039;ll show you instead! NOW DISSY!&quot;</p><p class="double">On cue, the draconequus kicked down the door to Macintosh&#039;s bar, dragging Spike behind him. &quot;FILLIES! GENTLECOLTS! ASSORTED OTHER GENDERS!&quot; He paused. &quot;Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Har har,&quot; a voice from the corner deadpanned, &quot;what it is to laugh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE SPIKE AN EARLY WEDDING PRESENT! The present of ONE LAST HOORAH as a single male. In ten minutes, I will take him on a wild and crazy whirlwind tour! That&#039;s right... I, Discord, Spirit of Chaos and Disharmony, am throwing Spike&#039;s bachelor party!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And!&quot; Pinkie shouted, getting up on the bar. &quot;In the spirit of gender equality, I, Pinkimena Diane Pie, have taken it upon myself to throw an equally crazy and wild bachelorette party for my good friend Rarity! Sign up sheets for both parties are posted around Ponyville, but remember! You can only go to one!&quot;</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare swallowed at the loud cheer in the bar. These were loopers, ponies with insane experiences, who considered death itself to be merely a painful inconvenience. Exactly what would happen, what could happen... she had not a clue. Even knowing that Pinkie would take precautions, even knowing that Twilight could magic up repairs, even knowing that the princesses themselves might step down to help with the clean-up....</p><p class="double">Her eyes turned to the two sheets that the draconequus and pink pony were stapling to the wall. Some part of her realized that it might be possible to mitigate the damage if she was present. Still.... it took her five minutes and a generous amount of cider to work up the courage to walk over and sign her name....</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmmrghfllum....&quot;</p><p class="double">Mayor Mare opened her eyes slowly. It took her a moment to process the face in front of her, mostly because she was still somewhat unbelieving that a mustache could grow on a beak.</p><p class="double">After another moment, she glanced down at the warm purple blanket they were sharing, following the scales up to a face with a big orange mustache.</p><p class="double">And then, the memories trickled in.</p><p class="double">She seriously considered panicking. Or hyperventilating, or freaking out in some other manner. But, eventually, Mayor Mare gave a mental shrug, nuzzled them both, and went back to sleep. It <i>had</i> been a fun night, after all. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The white unicorn murmured bleary, his reluctant eyes slowly opening in the morning light. He brushed some blue bangs out of his face, taking a moment to realize he was in a bed, and turned to see a purple unicorn staring deadpan right at him.</p><p class="double">There was a moment of rapid-fire processing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, this is bad.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare sighed. &quot;Calm down-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I mean, I was drunk! I didn&#039;t expect anything like-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just take a breath-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh no, oh god, what&#039;re ponies going to think when they find out about-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dude.&quot; The lavender mare burst into green flames for a second, leaving behind a black insectoid figure. &quot;It&#039;s me.&quot;</p><p class="double">The white unicorn paused. &quot;I... don&#039;t know if this makes it better or worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Come off it, Spinnerette, we both know it&#039;s you.&quot; The changeling rolled her eyes. &quot;Now shift back and let&#039;s figure out how to sneak back to the hive before anybody pins this on us--&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a firm knock at the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;...you still look like a pony.&quot; The changeling waved a hoof. &quot;Go on. Explain things, you&#039;re freaking Shining Armor.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spinnerette gulped, opening the door and coming face to face with his mirror image.</p><p class="double">&quot;....uuuuuuhhhhhh...&quot;</p><p class="double">He vaguely remembered something about Loops from the hive mind, something about Shining and changelings not being the best mixture, and put on a game face.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... can explain?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you remember anything that happened last night?&quot; Shining Armor asked calmly.</p><p class="double">Spinnerette tapped his hoof, considering his options, and decided to go for broke. &quot;Honestly? No. Nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well then. Let me remind you who you-&quot; Shining&#039;s horn shone briefly and snapped a window shut just before the other changeling could hop out. &quot;-and your companion suggested would make a cute couple.&quot;</p><p class="double">The disguised changeling gulped. &quot;Um.&quot; He remembered the purple unicorn he woke up with. &quot;I&#039;m guessing you and... somepony unacceptable?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My <i>little sister.</i>&quot; Shining Armor smiled politely. &quot;I would have let it slide because I understand changelings are lax in that regard. But then you started acting out our parts. Loudly. In front of all the partiers.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;And this morning, I woke up having to deal with the fallout.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aheh heh heh... heh... um....&quot; Spinnerette flinched back. &quot;I&#039;m... sorry. Really. I am. I, uh, I-&quot; Belatedly, he flashed back into his actual form. &quot;Uh... I-&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor stepped in. The door shut behind him. He was still smiling.</p><p class="double">Spinnerette fainted.</p><p class="double">The captain of the guard sighed. &quot;You. Stop scrabbling at the window and get your buddy out of here. Now.&quot; His stern eyes trailed after the changeling as he picked up his friend and scrambled out of the room.</p><p class="double">He managed to keep from bursting into laughter for all of thirty seconds.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis trotted in, shaking her head. &quot;Really, dear, is it necessary to traumatize my subjects?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, no,&quot; Shining replied as he disintegrated into a cloud of sparkles and became a blue unicorn mare. &quot;But I figure that Twilight and Shining are way too busy running the wedding plans to get involved in matters of honor... and hey, why not have a little fun while I&#039;m at it?&quot; Trixie grinned at her marefriend. &quot;Besides, you know you liked it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shrugged and sighed melodramatically. &quot;Oh, I suppose you have a point. And we do have an empty bedroom now...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I <i>love</i> the way you think.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are we all ready?” Pinkie asked, looking around her preparation area.</p><p class="double">Gustave and Donut Joe nodded. Mulia did something complicated with a pair of icing nunchaku.</p><p class="double">Cup and Carrot Cake exchanged a glance. “Yes,” they answered, in unison.</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle raised a hoof. “Me too?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie frowned. “Hm... backing music, please.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie nodded amicably. “Clover, set up.”</p><p class="double"><i>“Set up. Magic Flute.”</i></p><p class="double">“To start us off,” Sweetie said, bringing the silver flute to her lips, “Libiamo, or the Drinking Song.”</p><p class="double">As the first strains of music drifted into the air, Pinkie clapped her hooves. “Okay, guys, let&#039;s go! </p><p class="double">The trio Pinkie had first met all that time ago on the Friendship Express started work on their specialities, and the Cakes began constructing the bottom layer of a mammoth multi-layer wedding cake.</p><p class="double">Sometimes, the classics were best.</p><p class="double">On the other hand, a new fillip could be interesting too. Which was why Pinkie was making the figures for the cake top out of her super secret stock of capital-A Ambrosia, and then layering in several simple enchantments and a couple of more complicated ones.</p><p class="double">A lot of ponies had figures topping their cakes. Very few had ones which were <i>animate.</i></p><p class="double">Speaking of... Pinkie broke off her construction of figure-Spike&#039;s left wing to check on her experimental Sugar Phoenix currently curing in the no.5 oven.</p><p class="double">All indications were it was going super-duper.</p><p class="double">She grinned. If she&#039;d got <i>that</i> one right, it would breathe marzipan and regularly explode into a pile of toffees, before reforming from the powdery sugar dusting.</p><p class="double">Oh, and there was that apple, cranberry and peridot pie the size of a table she was making, too! And the sugarwork!</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s grin looked like it would take her head off. It was so rare she got to <i>really</i> cut loose.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dash dusted off the edges of her hooves. “Right. That&#039;s done and ready.”</p><p class="double">Normally, alternating between lazy and frantic was Dash&#039;s M.O. But this time, with something important at stake, she&#039;d decided to plan things out well in advance.</p><p class="double">The result was the complicated weather schedule laying in front of her. It meant that, for a full seven day window, she could guarantee the exact weather conditions at the planned wedding site with only a minimum of alteration on the day itself.</p><p class="double">So, technically, she was putting a huge amount of effort into being able to be lazy. Well, Rarity would probably prefer her to be in the audience anyway.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;m just wondering what the best time would be,” Dash repeated. “You know. So I can get the timing right on the weather effects.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, we heard you,” Rarity said with a sigh. “I know, you asked yesterday. But it&#039;s all got a bit... complicated.”</p><p class="double">Dash perked up her ears. She could hear the faint sound of an argument from inside...</p><p class="double">“Okay, look,” Luna said crossly. “I am as fond of Spike and Rarity as you are, sister, so to unilaterally declare that their wedding should take place during the day is a travesty!”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s just when weddings <i>normally</i> happen, Luna,” Celestia protested. “I am not trying to usurp the position of patron over the wedding in any way, shape or form!”</p><p class="double">“And yet, it is having precisely that effect...” Luna said darkly. “Besides which, were it to be put to a vote, I am sure that young Nyx and I would outvote you two to one.”</p><p class="double">“And why does she get a separate vote to you but I cannot bring in any others?” Celestia replied hotly.</p><p class="double">Rarity looked over her shoulder, wincing. “They could be a while...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Starfata}</p><p class="double">Applejack walked to a relatively unused patch of land on Sweet Apple Acres, bringing Twilight Velvet, Rarity and Spike along with her.</p><p class="double">“I didn’t collect as many things as Twilight while we were away, but I’ve been working on growing these samples from our trip.” She explained to the older mare, ignoring the way Twilight Velvet mumbled to herself while going over her checklists.</p><p class="double">“Some we traded for, and others were gifts.” She continued. “And Twilight held most of them. We thought we’d show you what we&#039;ve got so far.”</p><p class="double">Rarity perked up as they got close to the brand new Greenhouse the looping Apple family had built that first day. “What sort of plants do you have in here Applejack?”</p><p class="double">Applejack grinned, opening the door.</p><p class="double">Twilight Velvet looked up from her notes and blinked. “Is it just me, or is it bigger on the inside?”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded, supressing a grin. “One of Twilight’s spells? The Undetectable Expansion charm?”</p><p class="double">“Not quite.” Applejack shook her head. “Same basic principles though. If you’d like to walk this way, we’ve got all the flowers we could find in our pockets.” </p><p class="double">Rarity’s eyes widened at the rows of plants she could see- some type of glowing fern, some plants that Sweetie Belle had shown her from her trip to Middle Earth, and dozens more that she’d never seen in her life. “Oh my! You certainly have been busy Applejack.”</p><p class="double">The other looper checked to see Twilight Velvet engrossed in her exploration, then replied. “Not just me sugarcube. Twilight’s been collecting wedding presents for a long time now. I asked her to get samples of plants for me, and the others all pitched in where they could. We all wanna help make this a day to remember for the two of you.”</p><p class="double">As Rarity teared up at the sentiment, Applejack decided not to tell her about the surveillance system Applebloom was installing in the venue. It was going to be one heck of a wedding video when the Crusaders got around to the editing. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, that is IT!”</p><p class="double">Celestia and Luna both turned towards the door as Twilight Sparkle slammed it open. Her Element was on her forehead, and faint wisps of magic curling around her flanks served fair warning that she was on the razor edge short of Ascending.</p><p class="double">“You two have been arguing about this for <i>two hours solid,</i>” Twilight informed them matter-of-factly, with a calm that fooled nopony. “Since you don&#039;t seem capable of resolving it in a way that both parties are satisfied with, I&#039;m going to overrule you.”</p><p class="double">“But-” Celestia protested.</p><p class="double">“I have the stronger claim, in that Rarity is one of my best friends and Spike is in some sense a combination of brother and child,” Twilight continued over the top of Celestia. “As such, the wedding will take place at dawn. The weather will start cloudy, with one pre-scheduled clear sky window approximately ten minutes before dawn and then the clouds parting approximately ten minutes after.”</p><p class="double">Gilda strolled in, flicking her tail unconcernedly. “An eclipse would work too, of course. But unless you can both agree on a solar eclipse, it&#039;s dawn.”</p><p class="double">The two alicorns transferred their gaze to the gryphon. “Why then?”</p><p class="double">She flirted her tail again. “Kinda need dark sky for... an entrance. &#039;sides, it&#039;s a compromise in her favour – isn&#039;t she called Twilight?”</p><p class="double">Luna sighed. “It isn&#039;t as though we&#039;re going to resolve it otherwise.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{misterq}</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hello there, Twilight,&quot; Fluttershy said as she carefully walked into tree library where the purple unicorn was busy planning for the upcoming wedding.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello, Fluttershy. Did you need something?&quot; Twilight asked while peering over her lists.</p><p class="double">The yellow pegasus nodded, &quot;I just needed a book. Oh, are you still working on the wedding? Does that mean that no pony told you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Told me what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, um, about what happened. I suppose I should tell you, er.. You see, Spike and Rarity, they decided to elope. They said something about how they decided they didn&#039;t want a big &#039;too do&#039;, and ran off towards the beaches of the western ocean.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? But what about.. why? No, they wouldn&#039;t. I mean... Every thing had to be perfect. All the guests! The checklists! So many checklists.. so many,&quot; Twilight said right before her brain rage-quit and she toppled over on her side.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight? Are you okay?&quot; Fluttershy cautiously poked the passed out unicorn with a hoof. Somewhere, a goat bleated.</p><p class="double">The pegasus gave a nod and reached into her mane and pulled down a zipper. </p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ve still got it!&quot; Pinkie Pie giggled happily to herself as she pulled off the color-changing contacts and stepped out of her Fluttershy suit. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me, are you Prince Blueblood?&quot;</p><p class="double">The glorious stallion that was the apple of all of Canterlot, gem of Equestria, and family to the Sunbringer herself deigned to acknowledge the mare speaking to him. &quot;Why, yes, my dear. And you...&quot; He considered her face, recalling some announcement about a group of commoners that had saved the country from an absolutely garish lord of chaos. &quot;Why, you&#039;re the bearer of Kindness, are you not?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Generosity, actually.&quot; The unicorn smiled politely; Blueblood noted that her eyes and coat could well be considered a feminine version of his own, though the admittedly fashionable purple curls ruined the mirror image. &quot;You see, Celestia has agreed to arrange a wedding between me and my paramour, but I felt that with all she had on her plate I should find somepony else to help with certain aspects.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh?&quot; Auntie had agreed to such a thing? He supposed it wasn&#039;t entirely out of the realm of possibility. &quot;Do tell.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I need somepony who knows Canterlot,&quot; the mare explained. &quot;Somepony who moves in high circles. Somepony who understand the high culture, the cuisines, the character. Somepony noble and powerful.&quot;</p><p class="double">Prince Blueblood rose his regal head. &quot;Why, of course I&#039;ll help.&quot; This mare had a good head on her shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, thank you! It would have been so difficult to contact Fancy Pants on my own...&quot;</p><p class="double">That was... a strange statement. &quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; the mare explained casually, &quot;there are so many letters sent to him every day! I couldn&#039;t possibly ask him directly to coordinate with my organizer, but now that you&#039;ve agreed to--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, you... want Fancy Pants to organize your wedding?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, yes. Wasn&#039;t I clear?&quot;</p><p class="double">The prince smiled gently. &quot;My dear, you really should have said. I assumed you meant me!&quot;</p><p class="double">For some strange reason this confused the poor mare. &quot;Ah.... you did?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am, after all, the paragon of Canterlot nobility!&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare actually tittered. Tittered! As though it were a joke! &quot;Oh, Blueblood, you are such a comedian.&quot;</p><p class="double">He frowned. &quot;No, I&#039;m serious.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her laughter petered out. Her smile remained, though by now it was oddly strained. &quot;You... are?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But of course, my dear!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;....<i>oh.</i>&quot; The mare began to back away slowly. &quot;I... see. Well then, ahem. I shall be going! I&#039;ll be sure to alert your doc-<i>butler</i> that he is needed, is that alright Blueblood?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah...&quot; Something was definitely off, but the prince couldn&#039;t figure out what. &quot;I... suppose?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Tata!&quot; That strained smile disappeared behind a door.</p><p class="double">Well, that had been strange. Blueblood wondered what poor sap had been saddled with that mare, then decided he didn&#039;t care and went back to allowing the world to bask in his magnificence.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and I planted just enough evidence when he wasn&#039;t looking to land him in an asylum,&quot; Pinkie reported with a grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re <i>sure</i> this is alright?&quot; Fluttershy fidgeted a bit. &quot;I don&#039;t know if we should be doing this--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, I checked the asylums of this loop. They&#039;re very competent. And, well...&quot; Rarity smirked like a shark. &quot;I <i>don&#039;t</i> want him to ruin my wedding, and he <i>does</i> need this.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the eerie light of a full moon, a small party of travellers cantered down the main road.</p><p class="double">“...<i>still</i> think it&#039;s hilarious!” the largest of them said, a great earth pony stallion the size of Big Mac. Emblazoned on his flank was a strange cutie mark which resembled... a blocky metal claw, with four fingers to it. “I mean, you told us about your time here, but by the-”</p><p class="double">“Shut <i>up</i>, Bjorn,” a small, bright yellow colt said, ears flaming. “I don&#039;t ask to be nine years old here, so quit it.”</p><p class="double">The wolves loping alongside sniggered.</p><p class="double">“And you lot,” the colt added, sighing. “You&#039;re a bad influence on them, Leah.”</p><p class="double">The largest of the three wolves winked. “It&#039;s part of my job description. I <i>am</i> Awesome Werewolf Bitch, after all. This is just the Bitch part.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll tell you what you&#039;re <i>not</i>, though,” the sole unicorn in the group said. “A viking.”</p><p class="double"><i>I vote Leah Clearwater be adopted as honorary Viking</i>, a young dragon volunteered. <i>All in favour?</i></p><p class="double">Two enthusiastic yips and another bout of laughter from Bjorn carried the motion.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t feel any more violent,” Leah said lightly.</p><p class="double">“Hey, not all vikings are violent,” the unicorn protested.</p><p class="double">“Hiccup, Viking is a job description,” the colt said apologetically. “It sort of <i>does</i> mean &#039;violent norseman&#039;.”</p><p class="double">“And you&#039;d know, I suppose, Rush.” Hiccup shook his head. “Is it any wonder I turned out like I did?”</p><p class="double"><i>Yes</i>, the dragon replied promptly. <i>I&#039;m surprised you&#039;re literate.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Well, properly literate. Since those scratchings you call runes are basically straight lines bashed out by a rock on another rock, I suppose even cavemen could read them with reasonable fluency.</i></p><p class="double">“And remind me, Toothless, which of us was it who built a siege weapon in a hut with a box of scraps?” Hiccup asked pointedly.</p><p class="double"><i>Ooh, is Tony Stark here? Well...</i> Toothless let the word trail off. <i>Pony Stark.</i></p><p class="double">The motley group groaned or whined.</p><p class="double">“Where is this place they&#039;re holding it, anyway?” Bjorn asked after a moment.</p><p class="double">Toothless took two more steps and leapt skywards, snapping out his wings.</p><p class="double"><i>Next turning on the left</i>, he broadcast.</p><p class="double">“Show-off...” Hiccup muttered, grinning.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Uh... hi?” Hiccup said, scratching the back of his neck with a nervous hoof. “We&#039;re invited?”</p><p class="double">“Hold on a minute...”</p><p class="double">The utterly unflappable pony on door duty sorted through his clipboard. “Party of seven, from...?”</p><p class="double">“Well, the frozen north,” Hiccup provided with a sigh. “I&#039;m so glad to see <i>grass</i> again...”</p><p class="double">“Pah! Grass!” Bjorn said, shaking his head. “Back on-<i> Mount </i>Fenris, it&#039;s a warm summer when the ice is only one inch thick!”</p><p class="double">“I am <i>so</i> glad I&#039;ve only been there once,” Hiccup deadpanned.</p><p class="double">“Here we go. Back row on the left. And, if you could make sure not to startle the other guests, sirs?”</p><p class="double">Rush nodded firmly. “I&#039;ll kick the flank of any who do.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Velvet frowned. “How strange. I&#039;d thought Celestia was going to officiate, but she&#039;s in the seats with every- every<i>one</i> else.”</p><p class="double">Her daughter nodded. “That&#039;s right. A friend we met on our travels volunteered to do it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gilda watched overhead with an eagle eye as the clouds slowly parted.</p><p class="double">Luna had outdone herself for the occasion, and her sky was a glory in stars and nebulae and the tail of a vast comet, stretching across half the sky. Even with the lightening caused by the incipient sunlight, it was still easily visible.</p><p class="double">Then she saw it. A constellation that looked almost exactly like a running Saddle Arabian – the proportions not being right for a pony. But there were a couple of stars too many, making it look like it had five legs...</p><p class="double">She exhaled, colour draining from her fur and feathers before being replaced by red markings – on the crown of her head, on her haunches, on her back.</p><p class="double">Her tail arched over into her sight-line, and moved <i>just so-</i></p><p class="double">A silent explosion of light filled the heavens.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the crowd blinked back vision into their dark-adapted eyes, they noticed a change. Standing behind the altar was the largest equine any of them had ever seen – larger even than Princess Celestia, by at least three hoofs.</p><p class="double">Though he had neither wings nor horn, his presence seemed to fill the room. As though he was too large to fit – or, perhaps, as though he <i>would</i> be too large, except that the room itself had grown merely from his standing there.</p><p class="double">And, it suddenly became apparent, he had eight legs.</p><p class="double">“Hail and well met, all of you,” he said, voice rumbling out of a deep chest. “I am Sleipnir Lokison, Odinsteed, and I have been asked to officiate today.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, there he is,” Leah whispered. “Okay, I can kinda see where Rarity was coming from, he looks good in a suit.”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ll take your word for it,” Hiccup replied, applying Muffliato to all of them so they didn&#039;t disturb any of the other guests. “I didn&#039;t realize one of Loki&#039;s <i>kids</i> was going to officiate, though, that&#039;s pretty cool.”</p><p class="double">“He&#039;s Fenris&#039; elder brother, right?” Rush checked, getting a nod. “Right. I suppose I shouldn&#039;t be surprised he oversees this place.”</p><p class="double"><i>Hiccup,</i> Toothless asked lightly. <i>Can I wear a suit next time? I fancy being an island-to-island preacher.</i></p><p class="double">“We&#039;ll work something out,” Hiccup hedged. “Hey, can you hear that?”</p><p class="double">The various wolves, ponies and dragon pricked up their ears.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s an orchestra, isn&#039;t it?” Bjorn said with a frown. “Where did they fit an orchestra?”</p><p class="double">Leah blinked. “Okay, I recognize the music. It&#039;s Lohengrin&#039;s <i>Treulich geführt ziehet dahin.</i> Bella <i>hates</i> it, says it&#039;s too mainstream. Rants for hours.”</p><p class="double">The wolf shrugged. “In all fairness, she may have a point. The English name is &#039;Here comes the bride&#039;.”</p><p class="double">With a dramatic creak, the doors swung open.</p><p class="double">First through, in a simple white dress, was Sweetie Belle. A flute was hovering at her lips, and she was working it in a way which was physically incapable of producing the rich, multi-instrument sounds emanating from it.</p><p class="double">Then came Rarity, wearing...</p><p class="double">Well, it didn&#039;t look like <i>a</i> wedding dress, so much as <i>the</i> wedding dress.

<p>{Note: there is a heart song right at the start of this chapter. The two songs used as basis are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/OJM2g-3K2T0?version=3&amp;autoplay=1" rel="nofollow">&quot;What my cutie-mark is telling me&quot;</a> followed by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/y9pbSGLp3u4?start=41&amp;version=3&amp;autoplay=1" rel="nofollow">&quot;Justice for all&quot; from turnabout musical.</a>}</p><p><hr></p><p>{Filraen}</p><p class="double">Even without his inside knowledge of Yggdrasil, it was easy for Sleipnir to realize who was Awake and who wasn&#039;t by the looks of surprise. Expected really, as most unawake ponies would have expected any of the present Princesses to officiate here. &quot;Hail and well met, all of you,&quot; he said to all the guests with his best &quot;divine decree&quot; face. &quot;I am Sleipnir Lokison, Odinsteed, and I have been asked to officiate today.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the bride and groom walked towards him he started to hear a soft melody almost in the border of his perception, like a single piano piece. Realizing this was a heart-song on the brink of forming, he almost let his ears fold: he didn&#039;t particularly like to be part of a musical and much less being in the center of it. But it wasn&#039;t like he could really escape or resist: this was Rarity and Spike... Spykoranuvellitar&#039;s moment and Sleipnir wasn&#039;t going to ruin it.</p><p class="double">If his dignity was going to be the price to pay to keep his winning streak on the &#039;funniest Loop videos&#039; contest by using the wedding recordings, the eight-legged Yggdrasil administrator decided, then so be it.</p><p class="double"><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/OJM2g-3K2T0?version=3&amp;autoplay=1&amp;end=21" rel="nofollow">Good day every....pony, this meeting</a>&#039;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/OJM2g-3K2T0?version=3&amp;autoplay=1&amp;end=21" rel="nofollow">s under way</a></i></p><p><i>we&#039;re to celebrate Rarity and Spike&#039;s great wedding day.</i></p><p><i>There&#039;s only one annoyance, let&#039;s get it over soon:</i></p><p><i>if there&#039;s one who </i><i>opposes</i><i> this...</i></p><p class="double">Sleipnir left the note hanging for Celestia to end the verse.</p><p class="double"><i>... stand up so I can send you to the moon!</i></p><p class="double">By her side Luna raised a not so delicate eyebrow at her sister. &quot;Why the moon and not the sun?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Erm... so I can shield them better.&quot; Celestia managed, making a valiant effort to prevent flinching at Luna&#039;s insistent gaze. &quot;Don&#039;t make that face, I&#039;ll bring them back after the party.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sleipnir coughed once to stop their bickering, though Luna still mumbled something about the moon being her prerogative. The next verse was going to start after all, this time directed to the bride and groom with a bit of help from the audience.</p><p class="double"><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/OJM2g-3K2T0?version=3&amp;autoplay=1&amp;start=86" rel="nofollow">In life we start alone but that</a>`s not meant to be</i></p><p><i>the love of others is something that can make us really free.</i></p><p><i>But I&#039;m not here to preach you, I came to hear your vows,</i></p><p><i>so let us hear (so lets us hear)</i></p><p><i>what you hearts say...(what your hearts say)</i> </p><p><i>and spread your vow to your</i></p><p><i>and spread your vow to your</i></p><p><i>and spread your vow to your love and the worlds.</i></p><p class="double">The music didn&#039;t end with Sleipnir singing, he realized. Now he noticed how the song changed into a different tune altogether. As Rarity started to sing, she took the wedding ring from her sister. It was interesting seeing how Rarity&#039;s emotions on the heart-song put her on the verge of turning her into an alicorn, but she rode the heart-song herself perfectly without triggering the transformation.</p><p class="double"><i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/y9pbSGLp3u4?start=41&amp;version=3&amp;autoplay=1" rel="nofollow">You</a>&#039;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/y9pbSGLp3u4?start=41&amp;version=3&amp;autoplay=1" rel="nofollow">re no longer the child you were when I met you.</a></i></p><p><i>Spykoran, you&#039;re my knight, my strength to go through</i></p><p><i>When the darkness and despair try to hurt without compare</i></p><p><i>I feel we can safely fly to anywhere.</i></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara offered a smile to the other looping fillies, and brought the other wedding ring to Spykoranuvellitar just in time for when he started to sing.</p><p class="double"><i>Sometimes I doubt myself, &quot;is this everything a dream?&quot;</i></p><p><i>Having you, who are my whole everything.</i></p><p><i>You are mine as I am yours, no need for hoarding anymore.</i></p><p><i>I know precisely what I&#039;m vowing for...</i></p><p class="double">Sleipnir noticed another looper couple, Shining Armor and Mi Amore Cadenza if he remembered correctly, leaning on each other and singing voicelessly while Rarity and Spike put the rings on each other.</p><p class="double"><i>I vow for us (Always together)</i></p><p><i>I vow for caring (time and time again)</i></p><p><i>A vow through all the ages (we&#039;ll always be)</i></p><p><i>no matter how distant (on each other&#039;s side)</i></p><p><i>And if our paths were separated</i></p><p><i>Through some awful chance created</i></p><p><i>We&#039;ll always return back home again. (back home again) </i></p><p class="double">The heart-song enraptured everyone’s attention, even the local chaos draconequus Discord seemed calm enough to just take photos. Though Sleipnir noticed how outside the hall the guards were in pursuit of a blond white unicorn in a straitjacket when at an unheard sign both Rarity and Spykoranuvellitar started to sing in duet.</p><p class="double"><i>We vow for love</i></p><p><i>We vow for honor</i></p><p><i>To our home always be right on each other&#039;s side.</i></p><p><i>And if our lives had reincarnation, our vow would keep its affirmation.</i></p><p><i>Independent of location, species, race, time or of nation.</i></p><p><i>No matter what the situation, we will fulfill this obligation,</i></p><p><i>Through all the complications, sadness, joy and celebration.</i></p><p><i>For the future of us...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;By the power entrusted to me I declare Spykoranuvellitar and Rarity, husband and wife.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>We vow!</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike&#039;s ring, the one made by Diamond Tiara over the course of at least nine loops, flashed like the sun for a moment as the masking spell broke. When that faded, it still looked like a caged ring of light, caught reflected from the surface of a gentle sea.</p><p class="double">Rarity had made her own ring for Spike. While it had less of the pyrotechnic splendour of the one Diamond had made, it was somehow, ineffably <i>right.</i></p><p class="double">The band itself was, perhaps predictably, made of Tectonicum. (The sheer amount of time it must have taken to work it was impressive in and of itself.)</p><p class="double">Surmounting it was a faceted clear diamond which Rarity had made out of solidified magic – her own. It looked precisely like one of the three blue diamonds which made up her cutie mark.</p><p class="double">And within that, shining like a tiny red star, was a heart-shaped piece of Ruby Sunstone.</p><p class="double">As the heart-song ended Spike started to say something, but Rarity placed a hoof on his lips. Then, removing it, she kissed him.</p><p class="double">Dawn broke, and the clouds parted so that the very first sunbeam into the room fell squarely on the two of them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thank you all,” Spike said, some minutes later, in a slightly raw voice. “It was... everything I&#039;d imagined. Thank you for helping it be.”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded, not trusting herself to speak, but giving each of the many helpers – looper or not – a sincere look in the eyes.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle smiled. “We&#039;re glad you&#039;re happy.” Then she trotted forward, turning to address the room. “The reception&#039;s next door. I think we should all give them a little space.”</p><p class="double">There was a general rumble of agreement, and ponies and non-ponies started moving towards the doors.</p><p class="double">Spike turned back to his- <i>wife</i>, tears starting in his eyes. “I...”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled. “I know. Me too.”</p><p class="double">They embraced.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m so glad this happened,” he whispered, clutching her tightly. “The most valuable thing I&#039;ve ever run into, in any universe, is your heart.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">About ten minutes into the reception, Pinkie Pie hit a glass with a spoon and then climbed onto one of the tables.</p><p class="double">“Attention, everypony and every-oneelse!” she said loudly. “I would like to inform you that the kitchens have finished making the <i>real</i> meal, which is in room two – through that wall. Anyone who does not wish to participate in the <i>official</i> unofficial food fight should leave now.”</p><p class="double">“Food fight?” someone asked.</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “Hay, at least I&#039;m giving you all the option to participate or not.”</p><p class="double">Various ponies filed out. Those left included all the Loopers, along with Rarity&#039;s father (her mother having decided that Magnum could do this alone).</p><p class="double">“Right.” Pinkie picked up one of the custard pies laid out on the tables – which were suspiciously bereft of anything <i>except</i> pies and other such ammunition, in fact. “Let&#039;s-”</p><p class="double">SPLUT-SPLAT.</p><p class="double">Blueberries and custard dripped down her face.</p><p class="double">All eyes turned to the happy couple, who were each carrying two more and ready to throw again.</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled. “What? Who do you <i>think</i> asked for this? It&#039;s only good manners for the host to break the tension at a major event!”</p><p class="double">Her husband ducked as a pie from the general direction of Bjorn the Fell-Handed shot towards them at his head height.</p><p class="double">Then some sort of torte hit Luna, who retaliated with a meringue, and the culinary carnage became general.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“What&#039;s the first piece?” Twilight asked Sweetie quietly. “I mean, they&#039;re supposed to dance it alone, and I know they&#039;re good, but-”</p><p class="double">Sweetie smiled, holding Magic Flute to her lips. “I think they&#039;ll like this one.”</p><p class="double">Strings began to vibrate from the small Device.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity looked across at Spike. “How do you want to do this? Biped? Quadruped?”</p><p class="double">Spike frowned for a moment. “I think a mixture – one of those ones we worked out a while ago. Can you hear that?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn perked up her ears. “Oh,” she said, in a voice that brimmed with emotion.</p><p class="double">It was concert music, not dance music, and as a general rule one simply did <i>not</i> start with a finale piece. But that didn&#039;t matter. And as the finale of the <i>Rebirth of the Phoenix</i> began to swell around them, going from strings alone to horns to drums and flute, and swelling into one of the great triumphal musical pieces, the young-old dragon who was a mage&#039;s assistant and the unicorn who had always dreamed of creating beauty simply <i>danced.</i> As they had all those years and loops ago, at the Grand Galloping Gala.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was amazing,” Magnum informed his elder daughter absently, as the storm of applause died away. “You seemed more like one- one <i>person</i>, than two.”</p><p class="double">The couple looked embarrassed.</p><p class="double">“No, don&#039;t,” he added, looking a little more on the ball. “I know the feeling – compliments seem strange, sometimes. But it&#039;s all true. I take it that piece had some meaning to you?”</p><p class="double">“It was the last dance the night she consented to be my girlfriend,” Spike explained.</p><p class="double">Rarity chuckled. “As I recall, I asked <i>you</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Well, if we&#039;re doing things traditionally...” Magnum looked the question at the two of them, and they nodded. “That means I&#039;m to dance with your wife at some point tonight.”</p><p class="double">“Why not now?” Rarity asked. “I&#039;m sorry to put it this way, Dad, but I&#039;d really rather get it out of the way and get back to Spike.”</p><p class="double">“I know the feeling,” Pearl contributed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Richardson}</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash looked around the reception hall with a funny crinkling of her brow in confusion. Somepony was missing, two actually. Well, four someponies who should be there if she knew anything about the personality of one of them. Since they had somehow looped in without replacing Daring Do this time, they had to be free. So where the bark were they?</p><p class="double">They weren&#039;t by the drink table; just Applejack was there and watching her cider warily. Berry Punch must have been spiking it for Spike again.</p><p class="double">None of them had been thrown into the cake. Though one would run screaming from Pinkie as if she would suck out his soul or something. She rarely ever did that at her mega-parties anymore! Not since the MiniParty Incident! Though, on a plus side Blueblood had run from the building after seeing the cake. That had been good. Poor stallion had run right into the battalion of mental health doctors outside, too.</p><p class="double">None of them were harassing the mares, which was odd. Two of them at least tried most of the time, and a third one of the quartet could at least hold a nice conversation. This was getting pretty weird. Nothing was going wrong in the reception hall, everypony was behaving themselves, and it was making the frogs of Dash&#039;s hooves sweaty and itching like she had just been dropped into one of their novels. She was missing something, and as the unofficial bouncer of the wedding missing something was really starting to sour her mood.</p><p class="double">She looked out over the guests and the reception, and frowned. Twilight had gotten with Pinkie and made sure that the guests would be lured away from the &#039;narratively convenient set of windows&#039; that made up one side of the hall. The windows that Dash stood under, actually. Like straw and poison ivy was anypony going to cause some kind of ruckus by breaking through the windows, &#039;cause she had a bit of her unicorn magic going to reinforce the windows. Nope, Eenope! Nopony was going to get through them, they&#039;d just bounce off like Pinkie Pie vs. Gravity without wings! </p><p class="double">But what in the hay was that noise?</p><p class="double">&quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH~!&quot;</p><p class="double">One window stood firm against the impact of two bodies against it, reverberating against the stained glass in the painful way that only bodies could. The other window shattered harmlessly by the outstretched hoof of a far more savvy individual, and Captain Jack Sparrow and Commander Cane came screaming through the sudden opening in a high arc as the uniformed stallion clung to his shabbily dressed partner. Wings flailed about as Sparrow tried to make their landing dignified, only for Cane to cling harder and accidentally bring them to a tumbling halt in the wide open space Twilight had left for them. A moment later saw a grappling hook flung through the shattered window (which oddly looked more like crystalline sugar rather than glass) and reeled back to hook upon the windowsill. </p><p class="double">Ludicrous Gibbs, Captain Sparrow&#039;s second in command was the first to poke his head over the windowsill, followed by Cane&#039;s yeoman, Jurgen. The two earth ponies had the good graces to look ashamed as they climbed through to tumble to the floor atop Dash. &quot;Apologizes, one and all. It seems that a rather dreadful fright came upon the Commander when he read the guest list for some reason. Something about the &#039;God of Laughter&#039; out to eat his soul, or some rot. This was the only way we could get him in the building without him teleporting away from the doors.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie seemed to almost materialize before the quartet, holding up a flask of something for Jack who gratefully took it. For Cane, she rose up onto her hind legs and hugged him close. The poor Commander &#039;gleep&#039;ed in terror and froze up as she rubbed his nose. &quot;Candy! Oh I&#039;m so glad to see you again! Oh, I thought I wouldn&#039;t, with the way you were always running away, but now I can throw a party for you after this party! C&#039;mon and mingle, nopony will bite!&quot;</p><p class="double">Candy Cane twitched a little as he tried to squirm out of Pinkie&#039;s grip, which only convinced her to hug him harder as her mane pushed his hat off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mate, mate, Oi! Stop that, you&#039;re embarrassing yourself, mate!&quot; Jack hooked a leg around Cane&#039;s shoulder, tearing him away from Pinkie in the process. &quot;Matey, we have been invited to the wedding of the... ever, really. Everyone who is anyone anywhere in the multiverse has been invited. And they&#039;re all seeing you make a fool of yourself because of one mare. Why, it might even make them think that you&#039;re in love with her of all the silly things.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But-but-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, yes. The Eye of Parties, and all that. I know. But really, how many times was that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Three hundred and sixty seven times.&quot; Lemon Rush held up a glass of Berry Punch&#039;s special punch in a toast to the good Captain.</p><p class="double">&quot;See, an utter non-event in the grand scheme of things.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Eternal Parties!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not such a bad way to go, mate. I like to try and pretend every single day is an eternal party. Makes life worth living.&quot; Jack took his leg off of Cane&#039;s shoulders before picking up the Commander&#039;s hat and brushing it off for him. Two hooves jammed it down on Cane&#039;s head before Jack spun him around with his wings and shoved him towards the bride and groom. &quot;Now go apologize to them for trying to refuse their invitation and for making me make a dramatic entrance.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash dusted herself off, shaking out the disorientation of having two stallions land on her. She almost scowled at Gibbs and Jurgen, but stopped as the yeoman pulled an entire broom and dustpan set out of his ever-present saddlebags and smiled in the way that Fluttershy did, squeaks and all before starting to sweep up the mess that had been made. Wait, that hadn&#039;t come out of a subspace-no! If she looked into his saddlebags like last time, she&#039;d go crazy again trying to figure it out. Just leave it be!</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry about ruining your record, luv. Poor fellow was beside himself when he got that invitation from Pinkie.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, uh.... well, okay. Just don&#039;t do it again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course not. I&#039;d have to go outside, away from the beautiful, bountiful rum. I actually wanted to come in through the front door, truth to tell. But it seems that today-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No Captain Jack Sparrow jokes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Shining stood, to give the first of the customary speeches.</p><p class="double">“If I said everything that I feel about this, it&#039;d take all morning and completely <i>ruin</i> my reputation with the trainees. So I&#039;ll confine it to a few salient points.</p><p class="double">“First, embarrassing stories about the bride and groom. As for the bride, well, allow me to inform you all of an incident when we were taking bids for the tailoring of the guard dress uniforms.”</p><p class="double">Rarity started, eyes wide.</p><p class="double">“Well, it all started fine, as these things do. But... well, she was halfway through fitting Sergeant Shield into his outfit when my sister came around to ask for her help with a dragon...”</p><p class="double">Rarity put her head in her hooves, as the story went on.</p><p class="double">It had actually been several loops ago, but she had indeed left the poor sergeant pinned into a dress uniform mid-tailoring session for about five hours. Not one of her prouder moments.</p><p class="double">“The poor chap&#039;s still a little nervous around pins,” Shining concluded, to chuckles. (As it happened, Shield was sometimes – including this time – a deep-cover changeling, so the version from this loop would know not to contradict the story.)</p><p class="double">Then he looked at Spike, and grinned. “As for the groom – I&#039;ve got several more years to work from with <i>him!</i>”</p><p class="double">Spike winced. As he&#039;d half-feared, Shining started with the time a half dozen Stalliongrad notables had hidden behind a convenient pillar at the approach of &#039;the dragon&#039;, before discovering that said dragon was more engrossed in a lollipop, being about aged three at the time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Starfata}</p><p class="double">Pearl had been listening to the speeches intently, every name she didn&#039;t know and every incident she hadn&#039;t heard about carefully memorised. In fact, she had been listening so intently that she was shocked when Twilight Velvet gave her a small nod to let her know it was her turn to make a speech.</p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t let it show as she stood up. &quot;Rarity always had an eye for quality. Even before she got that Cutie Mark of hers. Thing was, she didn&#039;t always spend enough time looking. She sometimes gave folks a little too much credit, which isn&#039;t a bad thing. But it meant that she got hurt when they proved they didn&#039;t deserve it. So, she stopped looking for the good in people to spend more time looking for good gems to go on those dresses of hers.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pearl nodded to her new son-in-law. &quot;Now I guess she&#039;ll be looking for them to feed to you Spike.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a smattering of laughter at this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here&#039;s to Rarity and her best find yet! May they share many treasures in their life together, literal or not.&quot; Pearl finished with a flourish.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Magnum smiled at his daughter when it was his turn.</p><p class="double">&quot;I always expected this day would come. Truth be told, I wasn&#039;t expecting it to be quite so soon. In a way, that little trick of Discord&#039;s was the best and worst thing to happen to me.”</p><p class="double">Discord made an ironic little bow. Then tied it onto his goatee.</p><p class="double">“My daughter Rarity grew up, from a young mare finding her way in the adult world to a strong woman secure in her standing, with as close a group of friends as her mother and I ever could have dreamed, and a fiancé, now her husband, she&#039;s head over hoofs for – and who loves her every bit as much as she loves him.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s everything your mother and I ever wanted for you my darlin&#039;. I just wish we&#039;d been there to see it happening. Still, we&#039;re here now. And we&#039;ll always be here for you, even though you don&#039;t need us as much now.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Jcogginsa and Filraen, plus several for the messages}</p><p class="double">&quot;This is, quite frankly, the most daunting thing I&#039;ve ever been asked to do, and given my history, that says a lot. Trust me,&quot; Twilight began.</p><p class="double">She directed the attention of her audience to the couple &quot;Rarity, my friend who I first met at the Summer Sun Celebration what seemed lifetimes ago. Spike, my little brother and number one assistant, whom I hatched myself. I&#039;ve had so much time to get to know you both in and out of Equestria that I can&#039;t believe we&#039;ve lived through so much. After all this time, I don&#039;t know how to put it into words. How could I use words to describe Rarity and her generosity? How could I describe Spike and his Loyalty? These two were family in all but blood to me for years, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Words can&#039;t convey what they feel, or what I feel, about this day. They just can&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">She took a deep breath. “I&#039;m not going to wish you luck because you won&#039;t need it, I know you took all the time in the world to make yourselves absolutely sure to make this step. Just follow your hearts and I know you&#039;ll have a wonderful life together.&quot;</p><p class="double">During the customary applause, however, Twilight didn&#039;t move from her place, and by the time the stomping ended Twilight had produced a scroll. &quot;By the way, I have some messages from some ponies who couldn&#039;t make it today:</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Rarity, I hope you&#039;ve been fine. Knowing someone like us who was going to have a real wedding was the biggest surprises I&#039;ve had in a lot of time. So, in the case I can&#039;t get to the wedding: I know I&#039;m going to be in a few universes&#039; worth of trouble when, not if, the knowledge of your wedding spreads... so you better share a good time as a married couple so at least I know it&#039;s in part worth it. You and Equestria deserve it. Hoping to see you again, Ranma &quot;Rapid Hooves&quot; Saotome.&#039;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Rarity, Spike. I never in a thousand years thought you two were going to have a get married but I&#039;m glad you found happiness on each other. Now we&#039;re going to get our Wild Horse, so wish us luck. Best of wishes, Nanoha &quot;Starlight Breaker&quot; Takamachi.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When I saw you I knew I didn&#039;t need to do anything to get you together. In fact, I based a few plans around it. Love each other always. Tea&#039;s Tech.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your passion is pure and strong, so....&quot; Twilight sighed, facehooving. &quot;...have loads of mindblowing sex for me. Signed Wild Temptress, Pinkie&#039;s brother on the throne.&quot; Also known as Slaanesh, but...</p><p class="double">Various eyes turned to the pink mare, who shrugged awkwardly. &quot;It&#039;s a long story.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Dalxein}</p><p class="double">Big Mac stood when the first speeches were done, and the floor opened to general speakers. Clearing his throat, he started. &quot;Well, for as long as I&#039;ve known the two of yeh, you&#039;ve both been generous, kind, loyal and at least when yer&#039; not prankin&#039; some poor sap, honest, with everypony ya met.&quot; This was met with sheepish chuckles. &quot;That said, whenever ah see the two of yeh together, there&#039;s always laughter and joy. Always some kind of magic. Ah figure the both of yeh have enough Harmony to last as long as yeh&#039;d like it to.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{misterq}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie bounced up in front of the happy couple.</p><p class="double">She gave a big grin and started, &quot;I&#039;m not that great with speeches, since I know I tend to ramble on and on a little bit, sometimes, often, most every single time. So I think what I want to say to you both can be best summed up with the following interpretive dance.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then Pinkie sat on her haunches, smiled at her friends, shook a little; then suddenly took off upwards like a glitter-trailing rocket. A hundred feet in the air, a wave of brightly colored confetti exploded outwards from her like a firework.</p><p class="double">While the little paper streamers fell, Pinkie simply ignored gravity and stayed up in the air. Then she pulsed once with pink magic and exploding again with far more intensity. A wave of pink magic spread out from the pony-shaped epicentre. Wherever it passed, balloons and streamers appeared and lazily made their way down. Fancy customized party hats fell onto the heads of every party goer.</p><p class="double">Ciaphas took off his and stared at it. If there had been a legion composed entirely of silly children&#039;s party clowns, this would be the hat their commissar would wear. With a long sigh, he placed it back firmly on his head.</p><p class="double">Pinkie, still suspended in midair, folded herself into an almost ball shape, and then exploded for a record third time. The pink burst of light was a blinding flash. When all eyes managed to re-adjust, there on the plates in front of them was each attendee&#039;s favourite desert in cupcake or tart size.</p><p class="double">With that, the pink pony slowly floated down to the ground. &quot;Congratulations, you two!&quot; she shouted right before a twenty one party cannon salute went off, sending one final burst of confetti into the air. Pinkie gave the happy couple a curtsey and a little bow towards the rest of the audience. She started to make her way back to her seat, but stopped mid-step and seemingly vanished – only to reappear between Spike and Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Silly me. Almost forgot to do this!&quot; Pinkie said and pulled them both into a big hug. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double">The strange ape creature walked up to the podium. &quot;Greetings Equestrians! You all may know me as that weird monster that the drunk brought home! But my name is Jenny Everywhere.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a smattering of awkward chuckles.</p><p class="double">&quot;I first met Rarity and Spike while I was jumping across realities. Yes, I can do that, for some reason.&quot; Jenny shrugged. &quot;I can&#039;t always control exactly where I land, though. It&#039;s been... oh, I don&#039;t know how long since I&#039;ve seen my own home. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll ever see it again. So when I stumbled across other creatures that had been flung out of their reality, even ones that looked as fanciful as you lot do – I swear I had toys when I was a little girl that looked just like you, really! Well, I decided to hook up with them.&quot;</p><p class="double">She swirled her drink. &quot;Over the course of twelve years we all had so many experiences, good, bad, dangerous, dull... and all the ponies would talk about Equestria. And I figured, if I never found my own home, this might be a good enough place to settle down. Today, though, I&#039;ve realized something. It&#039;s not the land that makes this world great. It&#039;s the ponies, the dragons, the griffons... the people. And of those people, I can say without a doubt that Rarity and Spike here, they are amongst the greatest of your paragons. Not perfect – who is? But they get so close that you forget it sometimes. And when they&#039;re working together, I just... wow. Just wow, ponyfriends. WOW.&quot;</p><p class="double">Jenny lifted her glass. &quot;You two, I&#039;m not going to wish you a happy ending. I don&#039;t believe in endings. They&#039;re just kaput, and that&#039;s it. I&#039;m going to wish you a long life together, in love and harmony and whatnot. Live for each other, Rarity and Spike, and show Equestria just what it can become. Huzzah! And... yeah, okay, I suck at speeches, next please!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Discord stood. “They beat me at my own game.”</p><p class="double">He sat down again.</p><p class="double">On seeing some exasperated looks, he shrugged. “What? You&#039;re lucky I&#039;m behaving at all.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me start off by saying I have the best spy network in Equestria.&quot; Chrysalis smirked at the crowd. &quot;It takes training to spot a changeling, we have a hive mind, and I know that at least ten of my subjects are here right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was suspicious muttering and furtive glances.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, I can say positively that I know exactly how Spike and Rarity lived their lives, before and after the portal incident. These two are some of the best individuals I know, not because they were born that way but because they crafted themselves into wonderful ponies. And as a creature that feeds off love, I can tell you that... well, even with my thousands of children, we&#039;re going to be well fed for a <i>week.</i> To Rarity and Spike, true wonders of the world!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Stainless Steel Fox}</p><p class="double">Applejack took her turn. &quot;I ain&#039;t much for speechifyin&#039; but friends like Rarity and Spike deserve my best effort.&quot;</p><p class="double">She looked over at the radiant bride. &quot;Rarity, we don&#039;t always see eye to eye, and that&#039;s fine, because we&#039;re friends anyway. But two things I reckon I can get behind. First, it&#039;d take a stallion in a million to be worthy of some-pony like you; luckily, that&#039;s what you found, even if he ain&#039;t a stallion. Second, you both deserve all the happiness each of you can bring the other.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she turned to Spike. &quot;As for you, Spike, little buddy, I still remember all that time ago when Rarity was kidnapped by Diamond Dogs, and you were there fantisizing about rescuing her like a knight on Shining Armour...&quot; There were chuckles from a few guests, and a giggle from Cadence as she snuggled up against her husband. &quot;... I remember I told you to &#039;Whoa there, lover-boy!&#039;. Back then I figured you were just having crazy dreams, but it looks like dreams can come true, if you work hard enough at them. I won&#039;t say I hope and pray that this is everyting you dreamed and wished for, because I know for plumb certain that it&#039;s gonna be. So, I just want to say, &#039;Go there, lover-boy!&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;May your life together be everything you want it to be, because it couldn&#039;t happen to two finer people.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double">Fluttershy got up to the podium. &quot;Um. Well. Here it is. All I have to say is... it&#039;s about time you two!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Filraen}</p><p class="double">After Fluttershy ended her speech a small white figure poked her foreleg. The pegasus looked down to see it was Angel bunny who was holding an envelope towards her.</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it, Angel? Do you have a speech for me to read?&quot;</p><p class="double">The white rabbit nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure,&quot; the pegasus took the letter from Angel and started to read. <i>&quot;Spike, you owe me fifteen bits.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">As laughs sounded around the hall and Spike faceclawed, Fluttershy looked Angel with a questioning look. The rabbit just made a gesture encouraging her to continue.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;You bet you&#039;d teach me that card trick of yours before your wedding,&quot;</i> Fluttershy continued as Angel smirked towards the groom, <i>&quot;and I can&#039;t think on any better way to win a bet. Congratulations you two and be happy.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">After Spike and Angel nodded once to each other both Fluttershy and Angel stepped down for the next speech. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle hesitantly took the stand. “Okay. First thing I have to say is, I&#039;m really happy for my sis. I may not have spent as much time as I&#039;d like to have with her – especially because of... you know... but I can tell that he makes you really happy.”</p><p class="double">She nodded. “That&#039;s what&#039;s important about this, as I understand it.”</p><p class="double">“Anyway. Spike, take care of my sis, and... oh, who am I kidding.” She pointed grandiosely towards the dragon. “Coolest. Brother in law. Ever!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With the soft sound of paws, a large wolf walked gently up to the front.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll admit that I don&#039;t know Rarity as well as I really should,” she began, softly. “But I do know Spike. And I&#039;m sorry to perhaps put a damper on things, but... it&#039;s something people should know – because it shows in a way that really matters how good he is.”</p><p class="double">She took a breath, then continued. Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. “Without going into all the sordid details, he was instrumental in saving me from suicide – because he was there, and because he went out of his way to help, and because he was so careful to avoid pushing me further in a way that might go wrong.”</p><p class="double">There was nearly complete silence in the room as she raised a paw, and pointed directly at Rarity. “You are one lucky pony, Rarity. And I only wish I knew you well enough to say how lucky I&#039;m sure Spike is, too.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">From the memoirs of Ciaphas “Candy” Cain, Hero of the Imperium.</p><p class="double">When I discovered that, despite my best precautions, I had ended up within close proximity of the very being I had been so assiduously avoiding for the last two years, Pinkamena Pie, I will freely confess that my legs turned to water and my first instinct was to run like there was artillery coming in.</p><p class="double">Nevertheless, on sighting the presence of Lord Russ, I eventually recovered myself with the sure knowledge that, at least, any damnation that occurred would be technically his fault.</p><p class="double">So I kept to myself, out at the periphery of the wedding reception, for the most part. Jurgen was invaluable in the assistance he provided, largely in that he supplied me with the really rather excellent wine that had been laid on while staying close enough that I was within his comforting – though somewhat malodorous – aura.</p><p class="double">But, duty calls us all before the Golden Throne in time (though not me if I can help it), and so I eventually found myself called to the main podium to give a speech.</p><p class="double">I had to draw on my not considerable reserve of knowledge about the happy couple, and my not inconsiderable reserve of platitudes, to compose a hasty peroration which would hopefully mean that I was at least allowed to have continued access to the wine.</p><p class="double">“Assembled gentles all,” I began, turning to walk to one end of the small stage, “I have seen many strange sights in my time, and not a few battlefields. I have seen the great and the terrible that all sentient beings are capable of – along with that small contribution made by my own humble self.”</p><p class="double">Frankly, the only contribution I had made to the universe as a whole was some trenchant food criticism and a lot of not dying. But, as ever, my pretence of modesty fed the already inflated opinion of me that most of the audience held, proving once and for all that cynicism applies equally to the actions of man and xeno.</p><p class="double">“It would not be fair for me to say that I have a basis for comparison between my own experiences and those which these two will soon face,”{1} for if nothing else weddings are somewhat rare on battlefields, “but nevertheless it seems to me that what is well begun is half done, and this beginning to a marriage is a good sign for the future. May you both have the best of luck, many years together, and hopefully spend relatively few of them in mortal fear for your life.” I paused, to let the words sink in. “If you do, you&#039;ll be one up on me.”</p><p class="double">That awoke laughter in the crowd, though once more I was completely sincere.</p><p class="double">“Not bad, Ciaphas,” Lord Russ commented to me as I returned to my place. “Or is it <i>Candy</i>?”</p><p class="double">I shrugged, still somewhat awkward talking with one of the children of the Emperor himself, even after so long – especially when the Child of the Emperor is nine years old and a bright yellow pony.</p><p class="double">“Ah, Commissar,” Jurgen said, trotting smartly over. “I managed to locate some of the local <i>reserve</i> whiskey – you might find it of interest.”</p><p class="double">I took the bottle. “Thank you, Jurgen,” I replied automatically, pouring myself a generous measure – then stopped, noticing a label hanging about the neck of the bottle.</p><p class="double">In black hand – hoof? - writing on a bright pink card, it read:</p><p class="double"><i>Sorry for scaring you!</i></p><p class="double">The question of what, precisely, to do with the bottle&#039;s contents took me several agonising minutes to resolve.</p><p class="double">{1: Liar. - Amberley.}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie took the podium. “My speech is as follows!”</p><p class="double">Applejack tensed up.</p><p class="double">“Trixie first met Rarity in... a somewhat less than promising manner,” Trixie admitted. “And did not encounter Spike until after Discord&#039;s incident. But nevertheless, she is able to see quality when she sees it.” An embarrassed cough. “Eventually. So, in the vein of a unique conclusion to a speech – something I understand to be important:”</p><p class="double">She paused, dramatically.</p><p class="double">“Look out the window.”</p><p class="double">They did.</p><p class="double">There was nothing there.</p><p class="double">When they turned back to Trixie, she was shaking a watch. “Ah. It appears Trixie&#039;s watch is fast. <i>Now</i> look out the window!”</p><p class="double">They did again.</p><p class="double">For a moment, there was nothing. Then colourful explosions and lights blossomed across much of the sky, spelling out a message in firey letters.</p><p class="double"><i>CONGRATULATIONS AND GOOD LUCK!</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Elmagnifico}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The letters hung there for a moment before being broken by an explosion of prismatic light, which scattered the fireworks into spirals and backcurrents of pyrotechnic art.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash, accompanied by her trademark contrail, arrived in the wake of the flash through a conveniently-open window. She did a perfect two-point landing, coming to a screeching halt in what the more physically savvy onlookers figured must be a violation of some law of motion, and pivoted.</p><p class="double">She held one hoof up, indicating the happy couple. Behind her, the distant display was still playing out, with six wedge-shaped contrails of clean air cutting into it, until the roiling mass of rainbow and fire was shaped into a new series of letters.</p><p class="double">Before any in the audience could figure out who or what they were supposed to pay attention to, the sound arrived.</p><p class="double">It could have just been the acoustics of the chamber, or it might have been some crazily advanced pegasus magic. It might even have been everyone&#039;s imagination.</p><p class="double">What the assembled beings got out of the incredibly loud detonation, however, was &quot;WHO&#039;S AWESOME? YOU&#039;RE AWESOME!&quot;</p><p class="double">Satisfied her message had been delivered, Rainbow Dash turned and pointed at the now-fully-formed message made from her sonic rainboom, highlighted by the approaching Wonderbolts. The rapidly-dissipating mix of rainbow and explosive energy clearly said &quot;From all of us&quot;. And, while the grand majority of eyes were on the sky, two blue hooves bumped, and a unicorn and pegasus winked at each other.</p><p class="double">Definitely 20% cooler. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia cleared her throat. “Right. Well... as an alicorn, I have a long memory, and have seen many ponies grow and change – but Spykoranuvellitar is the dragon for whom I can say that I have seen the same. Spike, I remember your birth. I remember seeing you go off to Ponyville, and I remember the letter Twilight sent about her time there which mentioned the crush you had on a certain unicorn. I am sad that I do not remember all of the time in which you grew, and in which you and Rarity came to truly love one another. That is the only regret I have on this day.”</p><p class="double">She paused. “And Rarity? Do take good care of him.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Kris Overstreet}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I thought we all agreed,&quot; Rarity said, &quot;nothing extravagant for presents. Simple household wares would be more than sufficient.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it&#039;s a toaster!&quot; Applebloom insisted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Darling, it&#039;s a flamethrower,&quot; Rarity smiled. &quot;I just got one of those.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike ignored the crack, admiring the sleek wand and the well-polished flame reflector around the tip. &quot;Don&#039;t mind her,&quot; he said. &quot;I love it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I made it myself!&quot; Applebloom grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, darn it,&quot; Sweetie Belle pouted. &quot;I got you a toaster, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity unwrapped the gift in question and stared for a moment. &quot;Sweetie, that&#039;s an adjustable-output pony-portable plasma anti-tank cannon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It has a &#039;toast&#039; setting,&quot; Sweetie said. &quot;It&#039;s in between &#039;sunburn&#039; and &#039;political protest.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a crunch of cardboard and wrapping paper.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, dear me!&quot; Celestia giggled. &quot;I&#039;m ever so clumsy, I&#039;m afraid I just stepped on my gift for you! I&#039;ll just return it and bring you a replacement after your honeymoon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity raised an eyebrow. &quot;May we ask what it was, Your Highness?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A blender,&quot; Celestia said just a little too quickly. &quot;Definitely not a toaster.&quot; And definitely not a small magic-powered sun with a million years&#039; worth of fusible hydrogen built in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, I bought a blender too,&quot; Scootaloo muttered, leaning against a jumbled mass of wrapping paper three times her size. It was shaped suspiciously like a rotary multi-barrel cannon.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{FanOfMostEverything, Gym Quirk}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I got you a salad shooter!&quot; Pinkie produced... something out of her mane.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, uh, thank you, Pinkie.&quot; Rarity took hold of the... gift in her magic and contemplated it. It appeared to be the cheeriest firearm imaginable, from the daisy on the pink stock to the smile decals on the unusually wide barrel. More than anything, it looked like a hoofheld party cannon.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a hoofheld party cannon! I call it a funderbuss. You can shoot salads, jewels, dresses, just about anything that can fit, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... see.&quot; Rarity opened the breech. &quot;Oh, thank larch, it&#039;s unloaded.&quot; It was also much larger on the inside.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shuffled her hooves. &quot;I&#039;d have gotten something better, but you both already seem so happy, I couldn&#039;t think of any way to make you even happier.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike smiled. &quot;It&#039;s perfect, Pinkie, really.&quot; Rarity nodded.</p><p class="double">Yet another hug followed. </p><p class="double">Then Pinkie&#039;s eyes widened. “Oh! Oh! Because I wanted to be sure I didn&#039;t make this a not-party, I brought extra things! Here, have a cutlery set!”</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, dear? About this cutlery set...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeeesssssss?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I could be mistaken, but isn&#039;t that the Sword of Kahless?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Might be...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the paring knife bears a striking resemblance to Orcrist...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm...I guess if you look at it just right...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Also, Spike already has a lightsaber. Come to think of it, I&#039;m pretty sure he has three.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But this one&#039;s multi-spectral with variable-length blade control...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{elmagnifico}</p><p class="double">Macintosh looked on as Spike and Rarity opened his gift, his coat reddening as they did. </p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry fer gettin&#039; th&#039; same thing as everyone else. Ah guess ah figured ya&#039;ll needed a toaster.&quot; </p><p class="double">It was, in fact, a toaster. A small, silver box with two slots in the top and a standard thaum-plug with adapter for traditional electricity. </p><p class="double">Whilst Rarity was starting on the next gift, Mac grabbed Spike to the side. His whisper was barely audible over the ambient chatter. </p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s also a barrel of a lil&#039; somethin&#039;-somethin&#039; me an&#039; Berry whipped up situated behind th&#039; barn ifn&#039; y&#039; want to come by and pick it up later.&quot; </p><p class="double">A melodious vocalization made the both of them blanch. </p><p class="double">&quot;I heard thaaaaaaaaaat!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis trotted up to Rarity with a smile. &quot;I would have given this to you earlier, but I know how... sensitive you are about these things.&quot; She produced a thick tome. &quot;Volume one of five.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity glanced at the title and blushed furiously, quickly stuffing the book into her own subspace pocket. &quot;Um. Thank you dear, I... um.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Detective Ethan Redfield}</p><p class="double">And then they came to Discord&#039;s present. It was long, mostly rectangular shaped. Rarity eyed it warily as Spike tore open the paper. There was a moment of stunned silence. Twilight&#039;s mouth gaped, &quot;This...what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord&#039;s grin was so wide it could span the Grand Canyon, &quot;Do you like it? I even had it made out of diamonds!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity tilted her head in confusion, &quot;Discord, it&#039;s a door...with a doorknob attached.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord shook his head, sending chocolate frogs everywhere, &quot;Put it against a wall and open the door.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike placed the door against the wall behind the gift table and twisted the door knob. Somehow, it hung in the middle of the air and opened to a pocket dimension. Spike&#039;s eyes widened as he gazed in, countless monuments from variant loops inside. Rarity also looked inside and gasped. A few seconds later, they turned around, Rarity speaking first with a wry grin, &quot;The statue of Neighborty shaped like me was a nice touch. But why did you put it next to the chicken farm instead of the pyramids of Appleloosa?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Starfata}</p><p class="double">Nyx strutted forward, ignoring the &#039;awws&#039; from everyone still watching. Filly alicorns inspired them even more than regular fillies, she was almost used to it.</p><p class="double">&quot;As Princess, we have decided to gift the happy couple with this.&quot; Nyx said, holding out a box. &quot;A super hot cocoa fixture kit from myself and Princess Luna. We hope that it suits both your palates, as Princess Luna added a vial of unknown substance for Spike.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom pushed a cart forward, a lumpy shape in the middle covered by tarp. &quot;This here is from the Cutie Mark Crusaders – though ah think Scoots had somethin&#039; else...&quot; She dropped a small curtsey in the court style, earning almost as many &#039;how cute!&#039;s&#039; as Nyx had. &quot;We hope you like it. Turns out, none of us had a sculpting Cutie Mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">The couple shared a wary glance, before Apple Bloom unveiled the sculpture with a sharp pull on the tarp.</p><p class="double">Spike stared at the item underneath. &quot;Is that...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A model of Beauty and Beast&#039;s Castle made of fossilised tree resin? Yep. The sap didn&#039;t work right, so we came up with a plan B.&quot; Apple Bloom nodded. Apple Jack had loaned her the movie after she&#039;d made her first working VHS player. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">{Masterweaver}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the airship floated away, Rarity tossed the bouquet overboard. Dozens of mares leapt for it, but it suddenly shot up, split in two, and zipped to the back of the crowd. A very surprised Chrysalis and Trixie stared at the flowers now behind each other&#039;s ears.</p><p class="double">Twilight glanced at their growing blushes, before giving Cadance a flat look. &quot;I should never have shown you that invisible magic trick.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cadance smiled as the airship went over the horizon.</p><p class="double">Well... smile was, to put it mildly, an understatement. Her lips were parted, the corners curled upward, and her eyes wide with an amount of bliss that would be disturbing even on Pinkies face.</p><p class="double">Shining noticed she had gone completely still. &quot;Um.... Dear? You all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...........eeeeeee......&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s ears perked, her own eyes snapping wide as her horn glowed. A thick magical shield appeared around the pink alicorn just before she opened her mouth, reverberating as the bearer of magic fought to keep it contained.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sis, what&#039;s going on here?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve seen this before sometimes!&quot; Twilight managed, wincing. &quot;It&#039;s called cutie mark overload--augh! Shining, help me power this! She&#039;ll deafen everypony if it snaps!&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion complied, pouring his own magic into the shield. &quot;Cutie mark overload? I&#039;ve never heard of that!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just... basically, picture doing your special talent so well that you&#039;re overcome by ultimate euphoria. Most of the time it just results in fainting, but this was a <i>big</i> wedding and Cadance is an alicorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">By now, the pink pony was frothing at the mouth as she jumped for joy, still within the shield. Shining sighed. &quot;I should have seen this coming, is there anything we can do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Keep her contained until she&#039;s unconscious. When she wakes up, she&#039;ll be really happy.&quot; Twilight sighed. &quot;After you&#039;ve got her calmed you should probably report to a doctor...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Nearly time,” Spike said quietly.</p><p class="double">“I know.” Rarity glanced up at the clock on the dresser. “Only a few minutes left.”</p><p class="double">She snuggled deeper into his arms.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t want it to end,” she said eventually. “It&#039;s official, this time. And next time it&#039;s back to sneaking around and keeping it quiet.”</p><p class="double">“Well, we can enjoy the fused loops at least,” Spike volunteered. “Nothing to stop us there.”</p><p class="double">“I know, it&#039;s just-” she broke off. “It&#039;s... you know.”</p><p class="double">“It feels like such a short time.” Spike nodded, flicking the covers the rest of the way off their bed with his tail. “And it is. But we&#039;ve got a lot of short times together from now, love. It&#039;ll add up.”</p><p class="double">Rarity sighed.</p><p class="double">Spike eyed the clock. “About thirty seconds.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t, please,” Rarity pleaded.</p><p class="double">“Alright.” He put his arms more tightly around her.</p><p class="double">“I love you,” he whispered.</p><p class="double">“I love you too,” she replied with a fierce passion.</p><p class="double">There was a lurch-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...huh?” Spike said, several seconds later. “Did something go wrong?”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t know,” Rarity mumbled.</p><p class="double">He shifted his weight, trying to get up, and Rarity made a displeased noise.</p><p class="double">“Wait a second,” he said, eyes fixed on the clock. “That&#039;s changed.”</p><p class="double">“Pardon?” Rarity relinquished her grip, shaking her head, and followed his gaze.</p><p class="double">It was at least two hours <i>back</i> from when they&#039;d last seen it.</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s something under it, look...” she pointed out, and lit her horn to bring it down.</p><p class="double">When Spike plucked it out of the air, it turned out to be a plain white card.</p><p class="double"><i>You&#039;re welcome.</i></p><p class="double"><i>-Loki, Sleipnir, Hel, Fenris and Jormugandr.</i></p><p class="double">“Aren&#039;t most of those Sleipnir&#039;s family?” Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">“Er...” Spike ventured, nervously. “Did you Ascend last night?”</p><p class="double">“No,” Rarity said slowly, her wings moving slightly as she noticed their presence. “What&#039;s going-”</p><p class="double">Loop memories settled.</p><p class="double">“...I have to admit,” King Spykoranuvellitar the Just said distantly, “...that&#039;s one hay of a wedding gift...”</p><p class="double">Queen Rarity the Wise blinked. “Oh. <i>Oh.</i>”</p><p class="double">“Well, you said it was too soon,” Spike ventured. “How does another twelve hundred years sound?”</p><p class="double">Rarity reached into her Pocket and materialized her wedding ring, motioning for Spike to do the same. “<i>Marvellous</i>, darling.”</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>51.1</p><p class="double">“...huh,” Spike said, blinking at the deep sinkhole which had just appeared where Pinkie Pie had been. “I did not expect that.”</p><p class="double">“Neither did she, which is a bit strange,” Twilight agreed, looking down the hole. “Huh. Diamond Dogs, I think.”</p><p class="double">“Well, of course we have to save her,” Spike pointed out. “I mean, the mines are no place for a pony.”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave him a look. “I can&#039;t believe you said that with a straight face.”</p><p class="double">“Neither can I...” Spike admitted. “Right. Plan?”</p><p class="double">The ground erupted.</p><p class="double">“You keep pink po-ny!” a Diamond Dog said, throwing a chattering Pinkie out of the hole. “She too talky.”</p><p class="double">With a rumble of earth, he sealed the hole again.</p><p class="double">“Hiya!” Pinkie beamed. “Hey, you&#039;re upside down!”</p><p class="double">Twilight facehoofed. “So much for that.”</p><p class="double">Spike picked up Pinkie and flipped her back over onto her hooves. “There you go.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks! Hey, want to go get the others? I want to give those dogs a party! The place they live is so dull and brown, and I know <i>just</i> how to brighten up a dull brown earth place!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is going to go wrong,” Twilight said calmly. “I can tell.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t be a silly parade-raining pony, Twilight!” Pinkie replied, grinning. “Okay, RD, go!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s theory, such as it was, could be summed up as follows.</p><p class="double">She was at a rock farm, and she was miserable.</p><p class="double">Seeing a Sonic Rainboom cured her.</p><p class="double">Therefore, seeing a Sonic Rainboom would cure Diamond Dogs of their nastiness.</p><p class="double">All things considered, it was probably a good thing Dash could manage hairpin turns at supersonic speed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Spike looked over the huge sinkhole.</p><p class="double">“I can&#039;t tell if this went wrong or not...” Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">On the one hoof, the Diamond Dogs were all deafened by the explosion.</p><p class="double">On the other hoof, the Rainboom had shaken gems and other useful rocks and crystals out of the walls of the Dog tunnels.</p><p class="double">On the third hoof, it had made the tunnels all collapse.</p><p class="double">And, on the fourth and final hoof, they didn&#039;t know who to either blame or thank.</p><p class="double">“Is there a lesson in this?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“What about, don&#039;t let Pinkie plan things,” Spike deadpanned. “Especially not when she&#039;s on the hyper end of her baseline.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.2</p><p class="double">“Nuh.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom&#039;s eyes didn&#039;t want to open. Her pulsing headache might be a clue as to the reason, as might the fact that what little she could sense of the rest of her body suggested she was sprawled half-off some sort of furnishing. Her wings were crushed under her, and her horn appeared to be in contact with something.</p><p class="double">Her throat felt dry, and her mouth felt like a phoenix had died in it without cleaning up after itself later.</p><p class="double">After at least three tries, she cracked an eyelid. The light streaming through it had the intensity of a laser, and she closed it again with a wince.</p><p class="double">There was a quiet moan, followed by a slithering sound of fur on satin which ended in a loud <i>thud</i>. The sound of the impact set up industrial steam-powered triphammers inside Applebloom&#039;s skull.</p><p class="double">Several seconds of as much mental preparation as one can manage with a headache trying to remove one&#039;s head followed, until she gave opening her eye another try. This time, the light had dimmed somewhat from “laser” to “direct sunlight while in space”, which was theoretically encouraging.</p><p class="double">And so time passed.</p><p class="double">After about ten minutes had elapsed, she finally managed to get her eyes open long enough to see something. The bleary picture which emerged was of a deep pile carpet, from a distance of about five inches.</p><p class="double">That let her get some of her bearings. She was lying half off one of the couches in the living room. One she shared with... her sisters? Oh, the other Crusaders. Who, like her, were alicorn princesses this loop.</p><p class="double">Finally, she worked out what was going on. This was a hangover.</p><p class="double">With the name came the realization of a solution. Three tries, and she&#039;d managed to drink one of her hangover cures from her Pocket.</p><p class="double">Suddenly feeling much better, Princess Applebloom rolled carefully off the couch and stood up. “That must have been a great night...”</p><p class="double">“Shut up, please,” Diamond Tiara said in a distant voice. “I think you&#039;re using the Canterlot Voice again.”</p><p class="double">“Nah, DT, you&#039;re just hung over.” Applebloom stepped around a large stuffed chair to find Tiara lying awkwardly on the floor, face down, a blanket imperfectly covering her. “Here, anti-hangover potion.”</p><p class="double">Tiara snatched it and drank it in seconds. “You are a lifesaver, &#039;bloom.”</p><p class="double">“Ah try.”</p><p class="double">“Right, where are the others?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Applebloom peered out the window. “If I&#039;m not mistaken, that&#039;s Scootaloo dangling from the limb of that tree. Hi, Scoots!”</p><p class="double">A crash, a cloud of leaves, and a litany of muffled cursing interspersed with pained moaning drifted up from the courtyard.</p><p class="double">“Whoops...” The yellow alicorn blushed. “As for Nyx, I think she was fixin&#039; to get out that self-propelling chariot again.”</p><p class="double">“That sounds about right,” Tiara agreed, pointing to a mass of splinters on one of the tower roofs. An alicorn-shaped hole in the tiles marked where the driver had gone, into what they&#039;d made a storeroom last year.</p><p class="double">“Ah, fiddlesticks.” Applebloom shook her head. “Ah just fixed that.”</p><p class="double">“The roof or the chariot?”</p><p class="double">“Both.”</p><p class="double">The door opened.</p><p class="double">Princess Sweetie Belle stepped through, flanked by two guards. “I see you&#039;re awake.”</p><p class="double">“Hi, &#039;Belle,” her sisters chorused.</p><p class="double">“How&#039;d the evening go?” Applebloom asked. “I can&#039;t quite remember it all...”</p><p class="double">“Well, the highlight was probably when you challenged the Gryphon Ambassador to a duel...” Sweetie said critically. “Good thing was, he was drunk too, so he just suggested a drinking contest.”</p><p class="double">“I remember that now,” Tiara said, wincing. “Including that I won.”</p><p class="double">“Ah&#039;d have won if it were cider,” Applebloom said defensively. “But y&#039;all slipped in that banana gin...”</p><p class="double">“Nyx went a bit mad with that stuff,” Sweetie giggled. “Anyway, Diamond is now the Gryphon Ambassador to Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“How does <i>that</i> work?” Tiara asked.</p><p class="double">“No idea.” Sweetie shrugged. “I assume you should find out, though.”</p><p class="double">“So, what did Scoots do?” Applebloom got back to the original topic. “And why was she in a tree?”</p><p class="double">“Well, after the absinthe ran out and the dances were over, she got that Fokker Triplane you made last month out of storage and she and Nyx had a race.” Sweetie shrugged. “Long story short, Scoots managed to accidentally solifidy a cloud as she dove through it and landed in the tree after the Fokker disintegrated. I think the bits are still up there...”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Tiara counted under her breath, then nodded. “Okay, I think it&#039;s my turn to be Designated Ruler tonight. Usual catch-up meeting?”</p><p class="double">Both the others present nodded. Whoever was in charge on a given night had to be kept abreast of the events since last time they were the ruling Princess.</p><p class="double">Otherwise it was just irresponsible.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.3</p><p class="double">Twilight was playing around with international law again, this time with the full connivance of an interested Mayor Mare. (In return, Twilight had to do her paperwork for her next time she looped – cheap at the price.)</p><p class="double">So, the Books and Branches was an independent micronation. So, she&#039;d engineered Cadence as the Element of Magic again.</p><p class="double">On the other hand, some things were new.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Celestia began... then stopped, blinking at the surreal scene within the main room.</p><p class="double">“What?” Twilight asked, floating serenely about six inches off the floor, with a lidded cup of coffee floating in front of her.</p><p class="double">Then, as though nothing was amiss, she sipped some of the coffee from the cup with a straw. It floated gently off once she released it, until a flicker of telekinesis brought it back to rest.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Twi?” Spike said from one of the bookshelves, his tail lashed around a convenient handle and his body oriented sideways. “What was that book you were after?”</p><p class="double">“Edgar the Griffin&#039;s Decline and Fall, please,” Twilight replied. “I&#039;d like to take the opportunity to read it without undue strain.”</p><p class="double">“What is going on?” Celestia asked, a little plaintively.</p><p class="double">“Oh, well, you know I made the library an independent nation?” Twilight checked, and Celestia rubbed her forehead with exasperation.</p><p class="double">“Yes...”</p><p class="double">“Well, I put it to a plebiscite, and a two-thirds majority of Librarian citizens-”</p><p class="double">“Meaning both of us,” Spike added helpfully, pushing the huge book over towards Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Exactly,” Twilight picked up the thread again. “Anyway, there was concern that there were some outdated laws still in the statutes. So we repealed the Law of Gravity.”</p><p class="double">Celestia frowned. Then, carefully, she picked up a small pebble from the floor outside and tossed it into the room. Sure enough, it floated slowly along with the momentum it had started with.</p><p class="double">“I see. Well...” The alicorn stopped, and tried a new tack. “I was going to try to persuade you to give up the independence issue, actually. It really is quite a headache, not to mention that I don&#039;t particularly see the point.”</p><p class="double">“Why?” Twilight asked. “I mean, trade and tourism have both picked up substantially.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, some pegasus filly came in here to float around a bit yesterday,” Spike volunteered. “And also loaning books from the library now counts as trade.”</p><p class="double">The book finally reached Twilight, and she braked it with a hoof before opening it. Then she looked back at Celestia. “Sorry, I&#039;m being very rude. Would you like some zero gravi-tea?”</p><p class="double">She proffered a bulb with a nozzle. The liquid within it did indeed look like tea with milk.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.4</p><p class="double">Twilight felt the customary moment of disorientation.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, so, taking stock.</i></p><p class="double">First off, she was human. Female, which was nice, but with long black hair which only vaguely approximated her normal mane. That was annoying.</p><p class="double">She was on the limber of a covered wagon, with a horse hitched to it. <i>Sapient horse? No, earth-mundane variant. Pity, it&#039;d be nice to have a companion on the road.</i></p><p class="double">That thought touched something off.</p><p class="double"><i>Ah, the loop memories. </i>So she <i>did</i> have a companion. In fact-</p><p class="double">The head of a Northwest Coast Indian woman poked out of the wagon, two triangular ears perched atop it. “Hi, Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Leah, it&#039;s good to see you.” Twilight smiled. “Any idea where we are?”</p><p class="double">“I think so, actually...” Leah paused, thinking. “There were a few loops where I read anything remotely connected to werewolves I could get my paws on, which seems to have been a good choice given where I keep ending up. Remind me to tell you the time I was Moony once. But anyway, this looks like the world of Spice and Wolf.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s handy.” Twilight said, nodding. “What do you remember?”</p><p class="double">“Well, loop memories wise, I&#039;m the local harvest goddess – wolf in form, this is my human guise.” Leah waggled her ears, winning a giggle from Twilight at her expression. “We&#039;re off to find my homeland, I think?”</p><p class="double">“Dovetails with what I know,” Twilight assured her. “Anything else?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, the books could have been first year economics history course material at any college you&#039;d care to name.”</p><p class="double">A mischievous expression came over her face. “When I taught undergrads once, I did actually use them as course material. That was fun.”</p><p class="double">“So you&#039;ve done economics?” Twilight took a moment to make sure they were on the correct road, and turned back to the fellow Anchor. “Somehow, I wouldn&#039;t have thought...”</p><p class="double">“Hey, unlike some people my home loop doesn&#039;t have crazy super martial arts or hermetic magic or something like that.” Leah pulled a small notebook out of the air, and passed it over. “So, for training, I often go for the more... structured choice.”</p><p class="double">Twilight opened it. “History... Politics... Economics... Architecture... Leah, is this a list of degrees you have?” She flipped through the book, discovering there were at least sixty entries. “That&#039;s pretty impressive.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, what can I say.” Leah shrugged, grinning. “So, how would you improve the economy of this place, given what you know?”</p><p class="double">She shrugged again. “Hey, the books are all about discussing economics, why not live up to it?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, hiding a grin. “I&#039;m a bit negative towards thieves, you know.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah?” The leader of the bandits chuckled, his men echoing him. “Well, we&#039;ll just have to cope with the weight of your disapproval.”</p><p class="double">“Right, right.” Twilight raised her voice slightly. “Loss Prevention to the front desk, please.”</p><p class="double">There was a snarl, and a one-tonne wolf erupted from the covered side of the cart.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re fixing that!” Twilight shouted after Leah, as the latter put the fear of Her into the bandit gang. “Leather doesn&#039;t grow on trees!”</p><p class="double">“No, it grows on bulls,” Leah agreed readily, padding back and shifting. “Where&#039;s the sewing gear?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, I never need to use it,” Twilight replied. “You&#039;re the one who keeps wrecking her clothes.”</p><p class="double">“Hey, if you ever find a way to make a tunic not explode when your body mass goes up by a factor of fifteen, I&#039;m interested.” Leah threw a blanket around herself. “Right, can we stop for a bit?”</p><p class="double">“Only if you go hunting.” Twilight shrugged. “We were planning on stopping in a tavern, if you remember, but if we&#039;re going to sleep rough...”</p><p class="double">“Sure, sure. Anyone&#039;d think I didn&#039;t just save the cargo...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.5 (Masterweaver and misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Please tell me you know why we&#039;re centipedes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, no.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look at me! I&#039;m a grasshopper!&quot; Pinkie Pie bounced around like a pinball.</p><p class="double">Applejack hopped onto a fallen crab apple. &quot;Any idea why..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; Twilight pre-empted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness!&quot; Fluttershy, the butterfly, flew past her friends happily.</p><p class="double">&quot;At least I&#039;m still colorful,&quot; a bright, but grumpy Rainbow Dash followed.</p><p class="double">&quot;This feels so weird,&quot; Spike said as he landed onto a leaf and waved his dragonfly wings, &quot;But at least I still have &#039;dragon&#039; in my name.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The night shall last forever!&quot; Nightmare Firefly shouted as she suddenly shut off her glow, &quot;Or at least until daytime. But it will be a little bit darker without my butt light.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I.. I just don&#039;t know anymore,&quot; Twilight face palmed with six of her legs at the same time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just look at the bright side, Twi,&quot; Rainbow Dash flapped overhead with the butterfly equivalent of a grin on her face, &quot;At least you&#039;re not a bookworm.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;What sorcery is this?&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh took a moment to gather his bearings as he Awoke, glancing over to his... well, not his sister this loop, and from the looks of it more a Replacement then a Genderbent. &quot;Hello there. Welcome to Equestria--&quot;</p><p class="double">The white stallion started, whirling into what Macintosh recognized as a martial art stance. &quot;This realm is named Equestria? And how have I come to be in this form?&quot; Impressively, he managed to maintain his stance without shifting too much.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh.&quot; The farm pony sighed and rolled his eyes. &quot;Ah take it this is yer first fused loop then?&quot; He shut his eyes. &quot;Hrm. &#039;Cordin&#039; to mah loop memories, yer supposed ta be mah younger brother.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I&#039;m sorry?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, Ah should probably explain things...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So... the constant repeating of time I have been through is <i>not</i> some trick of Aku?&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh chuckled. &quot;Not &#039;less this Aku fella&#039;s responsible fer breaking Yggdrassil in tha first place. Granted, he seems like tha type ta do it, but from what Ah understand he&#039;s just not high enough ta actually have the power.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Anyway, since yer replacing mah sister, that means we&#039;ve got a bit of farm work to do. Oh, and yer gonna want ta see Twilight. Equestria&#039;s a sanctuary loop, but... well, we do have our own dark forces ta deal with. It&#039;s yer choice if&#039;n ya want ta help or not.&quot;</p><p class="double">The white stallion narrowed his eyes. &quot;A samurai always protects the innocent.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not impugning yer honor,&quot; Macintosh drawled. &quot;Just saying if ya want ta relax, it&#039;s fine. We take our hospitality and status as a sanctuary seriously here, and yer a guest. If&#039;n you reckon you need to keep a hoof in to not go spare, fine. If&#039;n reckon you need ta spend the whole loop meditating on a field of flowers, then we&#039;ll see nothing nasty interrupts ya.&quot; He smiled. &quot;By tha way, what&#039;s yer name?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...They call me... Jack.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.7 (BlankSlate)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s head tilted so sharply she felt her neck crack. Ponyville had looked completely normal when she&#039;d arrived there. No-one else had been awake, so she&#039;d decided to take a mild vacation and run a vanilla loop.</p><p class="double">Now, she was kind of regretting that idea.</p><p class="double">The Castle of the Two Sisters was... rather <i>different </i>from what she&#039;d expected. Instead of the graceful lines and elegant style of the Castle she was used to, <i>this </i>castle was...</p><p class="double">...well, rather obviously actually a <i>castle</i>. In the sense of a fortified structure, with all the heavy, rugged stonework one would expect from a place designed to withstand an active siege. A forty-foot tall rampart guarded the interior buildings and towers, with sturdy battlements and wall towers at the corners providing cover for the massive (though rusted and, unfortunately, closed) iron portcullis at the gate.</p><p class="double">Toss in that the whole thing was actually on a massive promontory sticking out over a lake that didn&#039;t exist in the baseline and Twilight was suddenly sure she was sitting in a fused loop.</p><p class="double">Right about that moment was when she caught notice of several fliers inbound, coming from the castle. A howl split the air, and Twilight&#039;s head jerked down to see what seemed to be a massive diamond dog jump off the walls and run towards her and her friends. Answering cries came from above as five pegasi descended.</p><p class="double">Even before they got close, Twilight could clearly see that the approaching pegasi were.. not the normal type. For one thing, their eyes were all glowing a brilliant green-tinged white. A quick glance down showed that the approaching diamond dog had the same eyeshine.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you think Nightmare Moon has them under a spell, Twilight?&quot; muttered Rarity. &quot;Pony eyes don&#039;t... <i>glow </i>that way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think a better question,&quot; Dash butted in, &quot;would be why do they have wings like a bat?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, though the combination was niggling familiar in the back of her mind. Glowing eyes, bat wings, howling...</p><p class="double">Four of the fliers stayed above as one descended to land. Twilight set herself, ready to take action... only to realize that the pegasus just kept getting bigger. A moment later, the massive black-maned pegasus landed, and Twilight shivered.</p><p class="double">The bat-winged pegasus was even taller than Celestia. More, it was massively built, to the point that in comparison Snowflake was a starveling half-grown colt, though this one had wings appropriate to the great mass of the pegasus.</p><p class="double">The eyes flared slightly brighter for a moment before the light faded away, leaving a pair of dark, yet otherwise normal eyes. &quot;What brings you to this Castle?&quot; The voice was deep, powerful, and male. </p><p class="double">And <i>familiar</i>...</p><p class="double">Twilight barely kept from yelling aloud. And just as tightly kept her body tense; suddenly relaxing as she now knew (well, 97% certain) that these newcomers weren&#039;t a danger to her or her friends would set off suspicions everywhere. </p><p class="double">&quot;I am Twilight Sparkle, student and protégé to Her Highness Celestia. I have journeyed here with my friends in search of the magics needed to defeat Nightmare Moon.&quot; </p><p class="double">The pegasus growled low in his thoat. &quot;I and my clan will aid you then. This... Nightmare Moon is our enemy as well.&quot; He motioned to those above, who likewise descended.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay!&quot; cheered Pinkie. &quot;So what&#039;s your names? We need to get the party planned for new friends!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ach, always with names,&quot; grumbled an old brown pegasus with a scar across one eye. &quot;<i>Everything</i> must always have a <i>name</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It never fails,&quot; chuckled the red pegasus with a white mane. He, and the last two pegasi, were all clearly younger, about the age of Twilight and her friends.</p><p class="double">Twilight let her gaze wander from a chubby blue pegasus to the last, a green pegasus slightly smaller than the others who had no mane, as their leader nodded firmly.</p><p class="double">&quot;I am called Goliath. And this is my clan...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.8 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double">The bar was relatively quiet, especially with Berry spending the day at the park introducing her daughter to the wonders of Mac’s Own Apple Sorbet Ice Cream.</p><p class="double">“It’s a nice thing you’re doing, making ice cream for the fillies like Ruby, Mac.” Cheerilee said from her seat at the bar.</p><p class="double">The big pony himself glanced down at her own dish of the confection and rolled his eyes. “Eeyup. For the fillies. Right.”</p><p class="double">She giggled. “Well, it’s still nice. What about Berry though? Are you two…?”</p><p class="double">That got a snort from the big red. “Yeh know Ah’m not lookin’ t’ settle down anytime soon. Neither are you for that matter.”</p><p class="double">Cheery grinned, idly stirring her sorbet. “Doesn’t stop a mare from wondering. Berry Punch has gotten to be a fine mare herself after she cleaned up in the loops, you know.”</p><p class="double">Mac gave her a deadpan look. “Y’all just want more li’l fillies an’ colts to school.”</p><p class="double">“Guilty.” She replied with a giggle. It went without saying that there wouldn’t be any new little ones until the loops were over, but it didn’t hurt to look forward to what could happen then. “Still… isn’t there <i>any</i> mare that’s caught your eye at all?” She said with fluttering eyes.</p><p class="double">Mac was about to scold his old friend for her teasing at his single nature when the door slammed open.</p><p class="double">“My matchmaking senses are tingling!” Princess Cadence proclaimed as she ran into the room.</p><p class="double">The stallion wasn’t amused. “Yer ‘senses’ weren’t right the <i>last</i> three times you barged in sayin’ that, and they aren’t right now, dangit!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, darn. You’re not going to budge on this are you?” Cheerilee faux-moped. “Single to the end, that’s our lone stallion Big Macintosh!” She ended in an overdramatic swoon, from which Cadence caught her.</p><p class="double">“You like finding ponies their special somepony too, dear?” Cadence asked with a grin.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee rolled backwards the rest of the way out of her seat and came up hugging the alicorn. “Do I ever! I love the love that lovingly loves little love-bundles into the world!” Which she would then teach to lovingly love the lovely world they were loved into being on.</p><p class="double">“And <i>I</i> love the love that lovingly loves two lovers into lovingly loving for love’s own sake!” The princess chimed.</p><p class="double">The two grinned madly at one another before shouting “MATCHMAKING MARES OF EQUESTRIA, AWAY!” and stampeding out the door to find poor saps to match together.</p><p class="double">Mac stared blankly at the door they’d left through.</p><p class="double">“…Ah really could’ve stopped this.” He muttered with a sigh. “Seems that bein&#039; involved in settin&#039; up the first permanent non-baseline Looper wedding ever ain&#039;t enough for her...” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.9 (Misterq)</p><p class="double">Nothing bothered Pinkie Pie. This was a fairly well known fact about the party pony about town. So when said mare calmly walked into Mac&#039;s bar - not hopped or skipped or trotted or sproinged in, but ambled in like a normal pony that was dragging her hooves; he knew that something was not right in Ponyville. The way her mane was twitching - alternating between poofy and straight, was also a massive indication.</p><p class="double">It was empty except for the two of them. Cheerilee and Cadence had left a while before and Berry Punch was off with her little one, so that left Mac to place Pinkie&#039;s order of an Extra Sugary Pony Colada on her table and take the seat across from her.</p><p class="double">After watching her use the straw to stir her untouched drink for several minutes, he finally spoke up, &quot;You want to talk about it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked up at him, &quot;Hmm? Hey Maccie. It&#039;s nothing really. You know me. Nothing ever upsets me. Unflappable Pinkie Pie. I never even ever had a flap installed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac snorted, &quot;I may not be the element of honesty, but I can smell the road apples from here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s true. No flap anywhere on me,&quot; the pink mare said with a small smile, which slowly fell as she looked up at her friend, &quot;Fine. It&#039;s just.. it&#039;s Candy Cane.&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac didn&#039;t say anything. Most times, he considered more can be said with silence than with any amount of words.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s the way he looks at me. He&#039;s scared, terrified,&quot; Pinkie continued, &quot;I don&#039;t really dislike much of anything, but if I did, then others being scared of me would be on top of the list. I worked really, really hard to change my image when I was in Cane&#039;s loop. I was the goddess of bright chaos, of joy and parties and celebration. But the way he looks at me, it just reminded me of growing up, when I was a little Pinkie. I thought I managed to overcome all that with the amount of time I&#039;ve had in the loops. Guess I hadn&#039;t yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mac nodded, &quot;What was it like growing up? You&#039;ve never done mentioned it much.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie sighed, &quot;It was.. it wasn&#039;t fun. &#039;If you have the energy to dance, sing, play, talk, laugh, slack off; then you have the energy to work harder,&#039; my dad used to say. They didn&#039;t really know what to make of me and my abilities. They didn&#039;t know if they had dug too deep or some ancient evil infected me at birth or what. My sisters were mostly normal, but they had each other and kept to themselves&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My family celebrated the day I got my cutie mark not because I found my special talent, but because it wasn&#039;t one of the many, many they feared it could have been. They never said so, but they were all scared of me. My family, my teachers, my schoolmates. I would also say my friends, but I didn&#039;t have any friends that weren&#039;t inanimate objects. That&#039;s the real reason I moved to Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You thought you were done with other ponies being scared of you, but then Candy Cane freaked out?&quot; Macintosh Apple conjectured, getting to the core of the situation, &quot;And it reminded you what you had worked so hard to overcome?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked up at him and just nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you know that when I was young, I dreamed of going to Canterlot to study Agricultural Magic on a hoofball scholarship? I wanted to explore new frontiers of Earth Pony magic; or failing that, become a locomotive engineer.&quot; Big Mac looked at the pink mare. She was looking at him in understanding, but not with surprise. He made a mental note and continued, &quot;Applebloom was just a little thing when we lost our parents. Granny Smith was getting on in years and we took the help of any of the extended Apple Family that had some free time and a hoof to lend. Apple Jack alternated between being despondent and angry at the world. That came to a head when she left the farm for Manehattan.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In school, I was also faster and stronger than the other colts. But I had the opposite of your problem. Every pony wanted to be my &#039;friend&#039;. When I realized that all they wanted was to either bask in my popularity, use me as a social stepping stone, or use me to win the championship game; where the place that truly needed me for me was back home on the farm - that was when I got my cutie mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie sat there thinking, before she asked a question with a small smile, &quot;Is it true that Apple Jack went all Apple Goth for a while?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, she didn&#039;t wear no black make-up or compulsively listen to &#039;Bauhorse&#039;, but eeyep,&quot; Big Mac chuckled. Then he looked directly at Pinkie, &quot;But you already knew all that. Just like you knew about my early days - or the fact that you need to keep trying to show Candy Cane that he shouldn&#039;t be scared of a pony that once controlled a place that used to be called the Eye of Terror. How did you even wrest the power from Slaanesh?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It tried to read my thoughts, so I shredded its mind until it believed that it was a fantastic idea to turn itself into a cupcake. Then I ate a chocolate frosted chaos god,&quot; Pinkie waved her hoof dismissively.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyep, because that ain&#039;t terrifying at all,&quot; Big Mac collected his thoughts, &quot;So if that isn&#039;t the reason, why did you come in here, Pinkie Pie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because talking to you always makes me feel a little better,&quot; said pony looked up at Big Macintosh, &quot;Plus, the awesome drinks.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a bit of silence as the stallion-turned-bartender processed the new information. Then he spoke up, &quot;Pinkie, before I was Awake.. Were there loops where we were together?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s wry smile turned into a genuine grin as she slowly leaned over and whispered seven little words into Big Mac&#039;s ear.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know what you like, Mister Smartypants.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she finished her entire drink with one long sip of her straw; and with a half-lidded stare, slowly sauntered out of the bar - her tail swishing provocatively behind her.</p><p class="double">Big Mac just stared at the door for a few moments. Then he turned around and started climbing the stairs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyep, now&#039;s a good time for that cold shower, I reckon,&quot; he said. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.10 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee awoke in a little flat in London. As her memories started to filter in, she could tell this was going to be one of the weirder ones. She was human once more, and that her name was Cheryl Lee and that she was a music teacher, the sitar on the stand in the corner of the room told her what instrument she was proficient in. But that wasn&#039;t the source of her confusion.</p><p class="double">Her second observation told her she had something on her head. She reached towards it, feeling something cold and metal protruding. Two somethings, one on either side of her head. She panicked for a moment thinking that she was a cyborg, but her loop memories told her that those were EBEs or Electronic Brain Enhancements and that they were detachable. Experimentally, she removed one of the two she was wearing. There was a slight tug, as if she were pulling on a magnet. Once it was free, she felt a noticeable decrease in her mental acuity, as if she&#039;d suddenly experienced a mild hangover. She put it back on her head, it reattaching with a snap, and the fog cleared up again. She also remembered that she could attach more, but that those who did tended to become paralyzed as they became consumed by contemplating the infinite. &#039;Go easy on your EBEs, indeed.&#039;, she thought to her self.</p><p class="double">Glancing at the clock, she could tell that if she didn&#039;t hurry, she was going to be late. She finished her sandwich, which her third observation told her was made of moths and butter and grabbing her bag, she headed to the window, did some quick calculations and flew off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee landed a block short of her destination, St. Heathen&#039;s Girls School and Conservatory. Thinking of whether to recalculate and fly off, or walk the rest of the distance, her eyes caught site of something. Two kids were spray-painting calculations on the wall. Worst of all, their calculations were wrong.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! A cosine is adjacent divided by hypotenuse, not the opposite.&quot; She said, running towards them. They ran off, leaving their spray cans nearby.</p><p class="double">Instead of giving chase, she considered the wall. Picking up one of the cans, and shaking it, she sprayed a strikethrough for the errant formulae, and put the correction above. Satisfied with the result, she put down the spray can and continued on to her destination.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It only took a few more minutes before she arrived at her destination, her classroom.</p><p class="double">“Hello, class. Sorry I&#039;m late. I&#039;ll take attendance and then we can begin”.</p><p class="double">She started calling out names until she came to one in particular.</p><p class="double">“Twilight MacSparkle.” She looked over in the direction of the purple haired girl.</p><p class="double">“Here!” She winked and Cheerilee nodded her head in acknowledgement.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Proceeding from there, she began her usual music lesson by firing up the Harrington 2000, the songwriting computer and let the students take turns creating music on it. After waiting her turn, Twilight walked up to the machine and spoke into it.</p><p class="double">“The song&#039;s key is M.” pausing between each sentence to allow the computer time to process the input.</p><p class="double">“The tempo is slow.”</p><p class="double">“The song title is &#039;List Mania&#039;” The computer hummed along before finally spitting out a paper with the lyrics and melody on them. Twilight took a look at the results before her face pinched into a frown as she returned to her seat.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Very nice, Twilight. You got a perfect score of 9.2.” Cheryl Lee said as she handed out graded papers. “The rest of you need to polish up on their grasp of negative reasoning.”</p><p class="double">The rest of the class groaned as they got their papers back.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee drew a problem on the board.</p><p class="double">“Train A left London 10:30. Train B is traveling on parallel tracks to train A and left Yorkshire at 12:30. If train A is traveling 20Kmph and train B is traveling 30Km, when will they cross each other?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Partaria?”</p><p class="double">“What’s the train&#039;s engine type, and what is the color of each conductor&#039;s socks?”</p><p class="double">“Good question! Lets say both trains are electric, and Train A&#039;s conductor&#039;s socks are brown. Train B&#039;s are white, while the toes and heel are plaid.&quot;</p><p class="double">“Does anyone know the answer? Yes, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Train A had an engine failure, and all passengers were held up for a couple of hours. Train B experienced no problems and rolled into the station at London at 3PM.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s correct.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Class was over, and as the students filed out, she signalled for Twilight to remain behind.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s your take on all this?” Cherilee asked.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s very bizarre, but everything I&#039;ve read seems to indicate that its experimentally verifiable.”</p><p class="double">“Even the socks?”</p><p class="double">“Especially the socks.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks for doing this, Twilight,&quot; Sweetie Belle said with a smile. &quot;I&#039;d take her with me, but, well, Baltimare&#039;s no place for a filly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a problem!&quot; The librarian waved in the unicorn foal. &quot;Come along, Rarity, say goodbye to your big sister!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity gave Sweetie Belle a final hug and a quick peck on the cheek. &quot;I know you&#039;ll be fabulous in Baltimare. Just don&#039;t forget us little ponies!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Haha, like I&#039;d ever forget my favorite little sister!&quot; The elder unicorn nuzzled Rarity briefly, before walking out the door. &quot;You behave for miss Twilight now!&quot; She waved at them as she ran for the train staion.</p><p class="double">&quot;...aaaaaand she&#039;s gone.&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes, turning toward the stairs. &quot;Spike, it&#039;s okay to come down!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled as the young dragon walked down the stairs, her youthful mask melting way into a wistful smile. &quot;Hello again, dear. Sorry for... well, the separation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike waved a dismissive claw. &quot;It&#039;s not your fault. We should have been more discreet. Um, Twilight, do you mind if--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just keep it PG,&quot; the librarian replied with a faint smile. &quot;Remember, as far as anyone else knows, you&#039;re both still children.&quot; She rolled her eyes and turned away, giving the pair a little privacy as they engaged in a long, deep kiss. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">51.12 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke sitting at a desk, notebook in one hand and pen in the other. Human again, she thought, glancing down and noting the pale pinkish flesh tone of her skin. More or less in front of her, sitting in profile from her point of view, sat a bulky human male in a dark gray suit, light gray hair in a buzzcut, perched on the front edge of an expensive-looking red leather chair.</p><p class="double">As Twilight watched, the scowl that appeared built into the face began to loosen. The process began with the eyes, which went from narrow and suspicious to open, then wide, then goggling. The clenched jaw didn’t drop so much as slowly cantilever downwards. The lines between the man’s brows relaxed as the furrows in the forehead deepened. The red flush to his face faded to white. His hand, which held a piece of paper folded in half extended forward, slowly dropped back into his lap.</p><p class="double">When Twilight followed the man’s gaze to her left, she felt like goggling a bit herself. Sitting behind a large desk, much grander than the one Twilight sat at, rested a bulk of human femininity. The figure wasn’t grotesquely fat, but she had definitely reached the stage where one could refer to her weight in fractions of a ton without being nonsensical. She wore a ladies’ suit, brown with thin pinstripes, the shirt a brilliant yellow offsetting the ruff she wore in front of her neck. Everything about her appearance reflected pride in appearance…</p><p class="double">… except the poofy, tangled, impossible shock of cotton-candy pink hair, shot through with a touch of gray.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie looked a bit shocked herself, but unlike the man and Twilight she wasn’t staring at anything in particular. Her blue eyes stared off over the man’s head, lips trembling at something horrible that only she could see. The Loop memories must be really bad, Twilight thought. I wonder who we’ve replaced this time?</p><p class="double">“I can’t take this.”</p><p class="double">The voice wasn’t Pinkie’s chirp. The gravelly growl would have fit the man perfectly, except for the razor-edged tremor Twilight recognized at once as coming from a pon- a person on the edge of a mental breakdown.</p><p class="double">“You’re not supposed to be there,” he continued, jabbing a finger in accusation at the bloated humanized Pinkie. “And you’re not supposed to be there, either.” He turned and jabbed the finger at Twilight. “Part of me says I’ve known you both for years, but most of me knows damn well I should be talking to Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. And you aren’t them.”</p><p class="double">The man lunged to his feet, raised a fist to slam it on the desk, and stopped in mid-swing. Instead both hands hit the table as he leaned forward, swaying, then flopping back in the red leather chair. “Over and over I’ve seen things. Sometimes they’re different, sometimes they’re the same. Once I saw Goodwin behind this desk and Wolfe behind that one. And I didn’t say anything. At first I thought it was a prank, and I wasn’t going to be caught out. Then I thought I was going nuts, and I didn’t want to let on.</p><p class="double">“But it just keeps COMING and COMING and COMING… and now you two. You two!” Now the man did hit the desk, slapping with an open palm instead of a closed fist. “Tell me!” he shouted. “Tell me what the hell is going on!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie had slumped back in her own chair, a hand over her eyes. “Twilight,” she said, “can you handle this? I need a few minutes.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. A simple calming spell would keep the man stable long enough to explain the Loops to him. She tried to cast the spell… and nothing happened. No magic. She tried to reach into her subspace pocket for something useful, and that also failed.</p><p class="double">Wonderful. A man slumped forward in his chair about to crack up right in front of her, and a friend who, from all signs, wasn’t that far from a crack-up herself, and here she was with her magic and Looper abilities blocked. Talk fast, Twilight, she thought, because that’s all you’ve got left.</p><p class="double">“Sir,” she said, and her Loop memories brought forward a name, “Inspector Cramer, this is not a joke, and you’re not going crazy.” Yet. “You have been repeating some period of time over and over. One day you wake up and it’s a year, or two, or however long in your past, and nobody around you remembers anything differently. Is that right?”</p><p class="double">Inspector Cramer took a deep, shuddering breath and flopped backwards into the chair again, relaxing. “Yes,” he rasped. “God, yes, that’s exactly it, except it’s a lot more than just a year. More like twenty-five. Sometimes it’s longer, sometimes it’s shorter. Sometimes it starts one year, sometimes another, and sometimes it’s hard to tell, but it’s generally about twenty-five years.”</p><p class="double">One of the longer Loops, then, and less regular. Maybe there was some pre-existing temporal distortion in the universe.</p><p class="double">“All right,” Twilight said. “Pinkie and I have experienced the same thing. I’ll be glad to explain it all, but first I think you could use a drink.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Twilight,” Pinkie murmured, her hand still shading her eyes, rubbing the bridge of her nose between thumb and fingers. “Will you have beer, Inspector? Or coffee?”</p><p class="double">“Whiskey,” Cramer rasped, “and then the beer. Please.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight finished assimilating her Loop memories as she explained the Loops to Inspector Cramer. Cramer was the head man at Homicide Manhattan South and had been for as long as Twilight’s Loop memories of him extended. The relationship between Cramer and the occupants of a certain brownstone two blocks east of the Hudson River was… fraught. The mixture of mutual respect and loathing, trust and distrust, antagonism and camaraderie stood beyond Twilight’s ability to sort out. She suspected that most of it came from the fact, while Cramer was paid a modest salary to uphold the law, Pinkie- or Wolfe, whichever- demanded and got outrageous sums of money to do what was basically Cramer’s job. Furthermore, when Pinkie- or Wolfe- took a hand, she often flouted the law Cramer was sworn to uphold if it was in her client’s- or her own- best interests. (Or his. Whatever. Replacing people in a Loop gave Twilight a headache.)</p><p class="double">Twilight’s explanations omitted a few details, most notably the fact that she and Pinkie were magical quadrupeds from a magical kingdom ruled over by magical princesses. Both Loop memories and common sense suggested that a man like Cramer wouldn’t appreciate such things, especially not in his current state.</p><p class="double">Twilight peppered her explanations with a few questions, and got some interesting answers. Cramer had lost exact count of how many times he’d Looped, but according to him it wasn’t more than about thirty or so. Leaving aside Wolfe’s intelligence and Goodwin’s luck, both of which tended to the phenomenal to hear Cramer tell it, he hadn’t seen or even caught a glimpse of any extraordinary talents or gadgets or anything of the sort. With a few changes which Twilight regarded as minor, all his loops up to this one had been baseline- no fused loops, no crossovers, no alternate histories, nothing. Twilight put the minor deviations Cramer mentioned down to Looper activity.</p><p class="double">The inspector, in all that time, had stuck as rigidly as he could to what he remembered. He’d gone through his repeated life scared livid that something horrible would happen if he didn’t play his part precisely to script. He spent a lot of worried nights lying awake wondering if he’d screwed up when his memory of past Loops failed him or when he encountered one of those minor alterations.</p><p class="double">Cramer obviously wasn’t the local Anchor. Twilight strongly suspected she’d replaced the local anchor, this Archie Goodwin, but Nero Wolfe’s name nagged at the back of her mind. This was her first time in this setting, but she might have read or viewed some fiction in another Loop about the character.</p><p class="double">When she explained the role of Anchors and her suspicions to Cramer, he smirked for the first time. It was a bitter smirk, but any form of smile under the circumstances was improvement. “And of course he didn’t say anything about it to me,” he muttered. “Either one of them. When one’s involved, both are.”</p><p class="double">“Consider a Looper’s perspective, Inspector.” Twilight jumped at the sound of Pinkie’s voice, so different from usual. Instead of her usual rapid-fire chirpy chatter, she spoke with a soft, smooth confidence… and, she noticed, a very slight accent under a crisp, clear diction. “Suppose that you had not, in fact, experienced dozens of iterations of the same day, the same year, the same life, over and over. Suppose then that someone in that position- in the position all three of us are in, and presumably Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Goodwin- suppose that someone told you they were repeating the same events again and again. You are a sensible man. Your common sense is deep and strong. And common sense would tell you that the person telling you about this repetition of time had taken leave of his senses.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie blinked and took a deep breath, and when she spoke again it was in her normal voice, cheerful and swift. “I figured you’d feel better if I used the kind of voice you’re more used to hearing here. You know, I could say that in Serbo-Croat if you like. Or French, or Italian, or German, or Russian, or Spanish, or Albanian, or Greek. I might even be able to manage it in Arabic, but that feels a bit rusty. That’s neat! I’m going to get a whole bunch of languages out of this loop- and so many words in Eques- er, in English I never knew before!”</p><p class="double">Cramer’s jaw dropped, and Twilight, amused as she was, couldn’t blame him. Thankfully Pinkie noticed that she’d lost her audience before Twilight had to say anything. She shut off her digression, took another deep breath, and went back to the Loop-local voice. “You’ll notice that most of us Loopers are a bit insane anyway. Loco in the coco, as I usually put it. But we’re also telling the truth.”</p><p class="double">“And besides,” Twilight added, “Wolfe and Goodwin may never have had the opportunity to tell you. If your baseline relationship with them is like what my memories tell me it is with us, you’re not on close personal terms. Did Mr. Wolfe discuss his secrets with you?”</p><p class="double">“Wolfe didn’t discuss secrets with anybody,” Cramer said. “Not even Goodwin if he could help it. I knew a couple of them, but not because he ever told me.” He shook his head slowly. “Wolfe keeps secrets better than any man I ever met.”</p><p class="double">“I think he may have good reason to.” Pinkie’s voice was back to Pinkie-normal, but sad. “If his baseline memories are anything like the Loop memories I got, he had a lot of really sad, horrible things in his past.”</p><p class="double">“Um… Pinkie? Would you like to talk about it?” Twilight asked gently.</p><p class="double">The pink-haired edition of New York’s greatest detective shook her head. “I promised myself I would leave all of that behind,” she said. “I didn’t want to remember… and I still don’t, really. But it’s really, really hard. The Pinkie Pie of this Loop loved hosting guests and making them feel comfortable, but she was hurt so bad she decided to shut out the world except for a handful of very close friends.” She tapped her obese body and added, “This was part of that; insulation against pain from both without and within- er, I mean inside and outside.” She smiled and added, “I really like words, this Loop.”</p><p class="double">Cramer snorted. “Wolfe loved words almost as much as he loved food,” he muttered. “He definitely didn’t like having guests, except for a few special people, but he took pride in his hospitality. Even with people he didn’t like.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I do,” Pinkie said. “And that’s the wonderful thing about the Loops, Inspector; you don’t have to keep doing things the same old way!” It was Pinkie’s turn to slap her desktop, and it made quite a bit of thunder. “I don’t care what this Loop’s memories are telling me. I don’t care what this world wants me to do. I’m Pinkie Pie! Parties and laughter and making people happy is what I am!</p><p class="double">“In this world I mingled in the highest society of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. I made the soldiers of Montenegro laugh even as the Germans drove them out of their homeland. I managed to organize an Easter party on the Western Front during the German offenses of 1918! I can sing two dozen different birthday songs in ten different languages, and I know over a thousand different cake, pie, pastry and candy recipes from around the world!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie thumped her desk sternly, but not as hard and before, and added, “And that’s before I Awoke and remembered more party skills from more Loops, more worlds, than you can imagine! And I’m supposed to turn all of that off just because the local narrative structure wants me to? I don’t think so!”</p><p class="double">And then Pinkie stood up. She had to use her hands to push against the arms of her chair- custom-made for her, Twilight’s Loop memories told her- to gain her feet, but she did it with surprising grace. As she stepped around the desk, again with much more grace than Twilight expected for someone of her bulk, she said, “I need to talk with Fritz about planning a party. We’ll invite Mrs. Hewitt and Sally and Freida and Ori and your friend Mr. Cohen, Twilight. And Inspector, you’re invited too- you and your Mr. Stebbins.”</p><p class="double">Her nose wrinkled as she added, “But not Lieutenant Rowcliff, because…” Her eyes crossed for a moment before she added, “The Loop wants me to call him an unmitigated cretin, but I like Meany McMeanypants better.”</p><p class="double">A bit of shock was returning to Cramer’s face. “Wolfe never invited me to dinner,” he said. “We never even spoke unless the subject was murder.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded. “Your world is a bit of a sad one,” she said. “I can’t change that… at least not this Loop. I’ll play along with the Loop a bit- I’ll be the great detective, and solve your tough cases, and squeeze big bags of cash out of rich people.</p><p class="double">“But I am not Nero Wolfe, and I’m not going to be a female copy of him, either. I’m going to be Pinkie Pie in whatever Loop I end up in, and that means those fees will be spent on making friends… and making friends smile.” She extended a hand to Cramer. “And you and I, Inspector, are going to be friends from now on… not this touchy-grouchy frenemies thing. Let Wolfe do that, if he thinks being Grouchy Sadderson is so much fun.”</p><p class="double">Cramer sat staring at the hand, but he couldn’t avoid chuckling at ‘Grouchy Sadderson.’ “I… I’m not the best in the world at making friends,” he said. “My whole life is enforcing the law. Wolfe never much cared about the law if it didn’t suit him.” He tilted his head and added, “And neither do you, I seem to remember.”</p><p class="double">“Pinkie usually doesn’t even care about the laws of physics,” Twilight giggled.</p><p class="double">“They care about me, this Loop,” Pinkie muttered. “I can’t get at my pocket, and I don’t think I have a Pinkie Sense here. Apparently all I have is what I have here,” she said, tapping her temple. “That and whatever’s in the pantry. Please pardon me, Inspector; I’ll call you later to arrange a date for your party. I can’t call it a You’re-Not-Crazy-You’re-Just-Looping-Through-Time Party, but I’ll think of something. Maybe a Let’s-Not-Be-Such-Grumpy-Grumpersons-And-Work-Together-To-Catch-All-The-Baddies Party?”</p><p class="double">Cramer shook his head. “Pie, you are definitely crazy.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked down at him, and her smile retreated to a modest upturn of one corner of her mouth. “Inspector Cramer,” she said, “it takes a crazy mare- er, man- to remain sane in an impossible world.”</p><p class="double">Cramer smirked again, this time with a little bit of warmth. “I’ll shake on that,” he said, and gave Pinkie’s hand one solemn shake.</p><p class="double">“Remember,” Pinkie said as she released Cramer’s hand, “you don’t have to keep doing the same thing all the time. The Loops give you the opportunity to try new things, to have fun, to go a little bit cuckoo. Use it. Who knows?” Pinkie grinned, and her eyes were almost as wide and innocent as the pony she usually was. “Maybe some Loop you’ll be genius detective Fergus Cramer, and you can drive Inspector Wolfe nuts!”</p><p class="double">Cramer’s smirk this time had a large dose of malice in it. “Oh, if only I can live to see that day.”</p><p class="double">At the door, as Twilight helped the inspector on with his coat, he asked, “I’ve just got one last question: if you two are here, where the hell are the real Wolfe and Goodwin?”</p><p class="double">“Search me,” Twilight said. “There are an infinite number of worlds. They could be in any of them. They could even be here somewhere. When Loops cross over, there’s no telling how they play out.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thanks, gentlemen,” the lavender unicorn said as he stepped off the chariot onto the streets of Ponyville. “I’ll put in a good word for you two with the Princess.”</p><p class="double">As the pegasus guardsmen lifted off again, the unicorn and his companion, a short, squat baby dragon, looked around the small town. “No street signs, no lights, nothing,” the unicorn muttered to himself. “Boy, am I a long way from home.”</p><p class="double">“It’s not that far from Canterlot,” the dragon said, pointing a claw at the city perched on the mountainside in the distance. “We could probably walk there in a day. And by we I mean you with me riding.”</p><p class="double">“Well, it sure wouldn’t work as well the other way round,” the unicorn said. “All right, short stuff, which way is it to the party coordinator’s office?”</p><p class="double">The dragon opened a scroll and looked at it. “Says here the town librarian’s in charge of preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration,” He pointed a claw towards a large tree not far off the town’s main square. “That’s the library over there.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn noted the large greenhouse built onto the rear of the tree-house library, and for the first time this Loop he felt an honest stirring of optimism. I’ll bet I can guess what kind of plants are in that hothouse, he thought. In fact, I can spell their names. Heaven knows I’ve done it often enough.</p><p class="double">A sign on the library door read NO VISITORS, but the unicorn opened it anyway. A deep voice bellowed, “BLAST YOU, CAN’T YOU READ?” The owner of the voice, a pony so overweight that the unicorn didn’t see how his barrel didn’t drag the ground, glared at the newcomers from over an open book. The earth pony’s coat was solid black, with a light brown mane and a bright yellow necktie. The unicorn noted with satisfaction the cutie mark; an orchid bloom. Of course.</p><p class="double">“Certainly I can read,” the unicorn said, floating a business card from his tailored suit jacket over to the librarian. “I trust that you can do likewise, or else the Equestrian Civil Service has made a grave error in staffing its libraries.”</p><p class="double">“This is a private library,” the black pony muttered. “And I am quite busy on a matter of urgent research, Mr…” The pony’s eyes widened as he read, “Arch Swiftlegs?”</p><p class="double">“That’s me,” Swiftlegs nodded. “Personal student of and troubleshooter for Princess Celestia herself. And I’ve been sent here to make sure that preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration are going according to schedule.”</p><p class="double">“Ah,” the earth pony nodded. “I, um, am Black Mountain. Good to meet you.” His attention turned to the little dragon. “And is the noble dragon hatchling with you as well?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, yes,” Swiftlegs added, “this is my assistant Spike. We’ve been together since he hatched. It’s a long story.”</p><p class="double">“No doubt,” Black Mountain nodded. “I must apologize for my lack of hospitality. Normally I enjoy having guests- a guest, you know, is a jewel on the cushion of hospitality- but I really have been very busy indeed. However, if your assistant knows how to brew tea, perhaps we can get started at once on the inspection.”</p><p class="double">“Sure thing!” Spike said. “Which way to the kitchen?”</p><p class="double">As soon as the kitchen door closed behind Spike, the fat pony’s mouth curled up marginally at one corner. “It is good to see you, Archie,” he said, “even in that ridiculous form.”</p><p class="double">“Likewise, I’m sure, Mr. Wolfe.”</p><p class="double">“What is that design on your rump? My own is quite straightforward, of course.”</p><p class="double">“What, this? The magnifying glass is obvious, but I haven’t figured out what the five white stars are for yet.”</p><p class="double">The fat pony grunted. “No matter. We can discuss this bizarre Loop later. While your assistant is out of the room, we must discuss an urgent matter I was apparently researching just before I Awoke. Did you know that tomorrow is not only the longest day of the year, but the precise thousand-year anniversary of the sole reign of Princess Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“I hadn’t thought about it, but I suppose I knew. Is that important?”</p><p class="double">“Possibly. Possibly even urgent. Have a look at this tome…” </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>52.1 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">And with a burst of green flame from her horn, Celestia&#039;s scroll burned to a crisp and whisked away to Twilight. She hoped that Twilight would follow her instructions, because the fate of Equestria...and herself...depended on it. Her eyes drifted to the windows and the sun. Before long, it would be nightfall and the beginning of her hopefully short imprisonment on the sun, so she decided to indulge herself a bit. Several servants were sent off to prepare some cake and in the mean time, she would walk among the gardens. </p><p class="double">The sun shone brightly and the wind playfully pushed at the celestial pony&#039;s mane. It was a good day as she walked among the sculptures. Stories of heroes and villains in ages long past accompanied each statue and all were dear to her heart. Or at least all but one, as she came to Discord&#039;s statue. Her oldest foe stood wearing an expression of utter joy. But then again, he never saw it coming, literally as he didn&#039;t realize the threat Celestia and Luna posed. </p><p class="double">Luna...who had helped her save the land from Discord...her head lowered and her insides turned to ashes. Everything seemed to remind her of Luna or what was at stake should they fail. </p><p class="double">*CRACK*</p><p class="double">Her eyes widened as her head rose to see a massive crack form in discord&#039;s statue. Her heart rate tripled. <i>No!!!! Why now? Why did the seal have to break now!? </i>She hadn&#039;t prepared anything for this. Then, the stone shattered and the laughter he had been holding in finished itself. Celestia shouted, &quot;Discord! How is this possible?!&quot; </p><p class="double">Her horn glowed but Discord just gave her a condescending smile, &quot;Oh hello Celestia, good seeing you. Unfortunately, we got to cut this reunion short, got to say hello to some old friends in Ponyville and figure out something to do before movie night. Looking forward to seeing you there,&quot; finishing up with a bright tone before snapping his fingers and disappearing in a burst of white light.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The doors to the throne room burst open as Celestia Shouted, &quot;Captain! Rally your men at once, one of my ancient enemies, Discord br-&quot;</p><p class="double">She trailed off as the sight of Luna on her throne in her non-Nightmare Moon form looked on in concern. Celestia&#039;s jaw couldn&#039;t get much more wide. Luna face hoofed and asked, &quot;Oh, what did Discord do now? Well, don&#039;t worry about it, Sister. We&#039;ll be sure to talk to him about it at movie night.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked her eyes several times, then rubbed her hooves against them, &quot;Luna? is...that you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna looked quite concerned, &quot;You alright, &#039;Tia? It&#039;s like you haven&#039;t seen me in a thousand years.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s eyes somehow grew wider in deeper confusion as her voice become more exasperated, &quot;but-wha...I haven&#039;t seen you in a thousand years!&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna rolled her eyes, &quot;Look, I&#039;ve learned my lesson already. Don&#039;t unleash a couple parasprites on an unsuspecting town again, I get it. I&#039;ve only been on time out for a week on the moon, just returned a few minutes ago.&quot;</p><p class="double">As she tried to formulate a response to <i>that </i>contradiction with history, a voice spoke from the throne room doors, &quot;Excuse me, Princess Luna, we wanted to get your opinion on our Nightmare Night costume since I was in the area.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia turned point her hoof at the pony who mentioned the defeat of Nightmare Moon and which went hoof and hoof with Luna&#039;s imprisonment on the moon...when a new sight made her eyes become like saucers. Before her stood another Luna that was picture perfect in her appearance. </p><p class="double">Luna rose from her seat and circled around the nervous alicorn. The night princess shoved her face into her face, scrutinizing and looking her over. After a few minutes of silence (which allowed Celestia&#039;s eyes to grow so wide it looked like they would pop out by now), Luna gave an approving grin, &quot;It&#039;s not perfect, but passable. A couple of the stars in your mane are wrong and the cutie mark is a bit off the flank, but otherwise you look just like my twin sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m standing right next to you,&quot; Celestia blurted out before she slapped her hoof into her mouth. Luna narrowed her eyes at her a bit, but then chuckled, &quot;Not to worry, &#039;Tia. No one can replace you. Have you met Chrysalis before? She&#039;s a master at makeup and disguises. Why, she promised to show me her changeling disguise at the movie night. I couldn&#039;t refuse.&quot;</p><p class="double">It was then that Shining Armor walked through another entrance, &quot;Excuse me, Princess Luna, but Princess Nightmare Moon sent a request for help with the environment dome on the moon. Something about the Beryllium Sphere needing replacing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna groaned, &quot;Again, that&#039;s the third time this month. Alright, I&#039;m on my way. Celestia, can you see Chrysalis out? I would appreciate it forever! Thank you so much!&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, the princess of the night disappeared in a blue teleportation flash. Celestia didn&#039;t say anything...heck she didn&#039;t even move as her eye just twitched and her mane became frazzled. Chrysalis walked around Celestia, then poked her, &quot;Um...Princess Celestia...you alright?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s mouth twitched for a second, then her eyes returned to their normal size. A grunt escaped her mouth, followed shortly by a chortle, then a chuckle and finally a laugh. Seconds later, she was rolling on the floor in mad laughter. It continued for several minutes before she managed to compose herself. Chrysalis backed away from her as Celestia rose to her feet once again. The changeling asked in a worried tone, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia was cross-eyed at this point, &quot;Never better. Just realized, this is all a dream and nothing matters. Discord couldn&#039;t have escaped his prison, both my and Luna&#039;s connection to the elements haven&#039;t been severed yet. Luna is still trapped on the moon as Nightmare Moon and the proof is you, Chrysalis. You&#039;re a perfect copy of Princess Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked confused, &quot;Wait...you think this is a dream?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What else could it be!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia walked forward a few feet, missing Chrysalis&#039; pumping her hoof in victory, but she didn&#039;t miss her whisper, &quot;Knew it. Pinkie owes me fifty bits.&quot;</p><p class="double">The sun princess&#039; eyes narrowed, &quot;I&#039;m sorry,&quot; her head snapping to the queen, &quot;What was that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis lifted a hoof in a placating gesture, &quot;Nothing, princess...nothing at all. I got to go. See you at movie night.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.2 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rusty blinked Awake in the pilot&#039;s seat of the X-1, which was thankfully on autopilot at the moment, and reached up to scratch at his scalp. <i>Bald again</i>, he noted morosely. Loops in the mirror universe were always pleasant, but waking up in the baseline afterwards tended to leave him disappointed.</p><p class="double">Still, he might be able to swing the musical again at the very least, he&#039;d made sure to keep a copy of the script in his Pocket ever since he&#039;d finished it, and knew which contacts he&#039;d have to make on broadway.</p><p class="double">He put that line of though on hold as he gave his Loop memories a cursory review for any glaring changes to the timeline. On his way to Mexico, officially to do a physics lecture, privately to pick up certain questionably legal &#039;medications&#039;. He&#039;d drop those and pay the knife jockeys to cut his twin out of him. And pay them extra to leave everything else where it was. Temporarily converting H.E.L.P.eR into a power suit would ingratiate Jonas to him, and Loops worth of debugging his inventions would ensure he didn&#039;t get outdone.</p><p class="double">A burst of chatter and the sound of scampering feet from the back of the plane shook him out of his planning and he frowned at the interruption.</p><p class="double">“Girls!” He shouted, “no horsing around on the X-1!” Wait. Girls? He paused to consider what he&#039;d just said and examined his Loop memories more carefully. Hank and Dean seemed to have been replaced by Bella, though apparently he called her &#039;Sweetie&#039;, and Blossom. The second gave him pause as he furiously hoped that this wasn&#039;t a Powerpuff fused Loop. Utonium had Had Words with him the last time that&#039;d happened.</p><p class="double">A snort of laughter from the seat beside him drew his attention to... Dash, a woman with rainbow dyed hair who had apparently swapped in for Brock.</p><p class="double">“Alright, we&#039;re almost there, so I hope you&#039;re all Awake,” he called out.</p><p class="double">“Bright eyed and apparently tailless,” Dash answered amicably.</p><p class="double">“Both o&#039; us!” Blossom said as the two girls moved to the front of the plane.</p><p class="double">“Good. You two,” he pointed at the girls, “stay on the plane. My nemesis likes to kidnap my kids first thing, and there&#039;s no telling what nonsense he&#039;ll pull if he&#039;s Awake.”</p><p class="double">“Your nemesis is Looping?” Sweetie asked. It wasn&#039;t unheard of, as proved by Chrysalis and Discord, but villains Looping was unusual, and it was doubly so for them to <i>remain</i> villains after any significant amount of time.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a frenemy thing,” Venture grumbled, pinching the bridge of his nose. “He&#039;s annoying, but super-villainy is more of a sport than anything here. My life is weird.”</p><p class="double">“Riiiiight,” Blossom said after a moment. “Gimme the schematics and some tools an&#039; I&#039;ll be <i>happy</i> ta stay aboard,” she patted the plane&#039;s console in an almost loving way that immediately identified her as an engineer. Rusty was almost disappointed that she was practically guaranteed to show him up, but at the very least he&#039;d be able to crib a few ideas for future loops.</p><p class="double">“Deal, just make sure we can make a quick getaway. Anyways, you,” he pointed at Dash, “need to make sure some surgeons don&#039;t steal my kidneys while they&#039;re extracting the twin I consumed in the womb.”</p><p class="double">He took a certain amount of satisfaction from their dumbfounded expressions.</p><p class="double">“I told you my life is weird.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I still don&#039;t get why you&#039;re afraid of the rabbit,” Twenty Four lamented. “It&#039;s tiny and adorable and has a little fluffy tail. And you&#039;re a total badass!”</p><p class="double">“Dude, I&#039;ve been <i>in</i> Holy Grail Loops,” Twenty One answered between pushups. It was always a hassle getting back into shape at the start of a loop, but so very worth it. “Messing with bunnies? Bad idea.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, alright, we&#039;ll leave the bunny alone. What about the new Monarch, got a bead on her?”</p><p class="double">“Seems like a nice girl. Little shy, though. Might wanna call in Killinger to help out.”</p><p class="double">“I thought you hated that guy?” Twenty Four was still relatively new to the Loops and getting used to the new dynamics. His best friend suddenly being a commando that could go toe to toe with Brock “unstoppable killing machine” Samson sometimes seemed like the least of it.</p><p class="double">“Eh, he&#039;s not so bad once you get to know him.”</p><p class="double">“Is he Looping?”</p><p class="double">“No idea, guy&#039;s impossible to read.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rusty pulled the X-1 into the Venture hangar while Blossom, or “Apple Bloom” as she apparently usually went by, excitedly discussed prosthesis possibilities with Jonas in the back. The whole trip had gone surprisingly smoothly, with none of the Monarch&#039;s usual shenanigans and a clean extraction of his twin. Apple Bloom had even managed to milk a seven percent efficiency increase out of the engines in the few hours she&#039;d had. If things stayed this quiet he might even try for a vacation Loop.</p><p class="double">Those hopes were dashed as he spotted the two figures waiting at the bottom of the loading ramp as they exited. The first, who he guessed was subbing for Dermott, ran past him and started chatting animatedly with the girls. The other was a woman wearing a familiar lab coat, though in purple with a star shaped sigil rather than the usual black with skull motif. On her face was a bone white mask, unmarked save for a conical horn rising from the forehead.</p><p class="double">“Greetings,” the woman said seriously. “I am Doctor Twilight Killinger, and this,” she held up a purple purse, “is my Fearsome Friendship Bag.”</p><p class="double">Rusty pinched the bridge of his nose and was about to retort when a door slammed open in the hangar. A woman in blue swept in, cape billowing behind her impressively. Trixie Orpheus, his Loop memories supplied.</p><p class="double">“HALT!” She proclaimed, pressing one hand to her temple while the other pointed at Twilight, fingers splayed wide. “I detect a terrible EVIL here! It seeks to CORRUPT and SUBVERT you! BEGONE foul interloper, you have no place here!”</p><p class="double">With each word she advanced, a brilliant white glow gathering around her outstretched hand. Finally, only a few steps away, the radiance reached a peak before exploding outwards, bathing the entire hangar in fierce light.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared stonily at Trixie for a long moment, completely unscathed by the display.</p><p class="double">“Your powers are useless on me, you silly filly.”</p><p class="double">The stare down continued for another few moments before the pair cracked and started laughing.</p><p class="double">“Sorry about that, Dr Venture,” Twilight said as she turned to face Rusty again and extended her hand. “We couldn&#039;t resist. Twilight Sparkle, Equestrian Anchor at your service.”</p><p class="double">“Thaddeus Venture, super scientist,” he deadpanned in reply. “Welcome to the Ventureverse.” That got him a few stares. “Don&#039;t look at me. Hank&#039;s the Anchor, he named it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There&#039;s, uh, a fair chance you&#039;re gonna regret letting him handle this,” Bronco cautioned as they waited in the Ponyville auditorium.</p><p class="double">“Well, he told me he wasn&#039;t gonna hurt anypony, an&#039; trust me, I can tell if somepony&#039;s lying.” Applejack answered beside him.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, not sure he&#039;s <i>capable</i> of lying, doesn&#039;t mean you should trust him. Killinger, ah, I mean, &#039;Dusk Contract&#039; is a slippery bastard when he has a mind to be.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn in question was standing in the center of the auditorium, night black with a grey mane and a cutie mark of twisting red lines that suggested the shape of a skull.</p><p class="double">The ceremony began and, right on cue, shadows coalesced on stage, taking the form of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Dusk called out, “excellent! Seize control of vhat iz rightfully yours und assert your dominance over those who denied your magnificence! Now iz zee hour of your victory, und so long as you remain firm in your purpose you are invincible!”</p><p class="double">“Um, what?” Luna asked, confused. She&#039;d intended cause a little scare, &#039;notice&#039; that her armor had gone out of style, revert to her typical form and then step aside for her sister. Encouragement was usually the last thing she expected while still in Nightmare Mode.</p><p class="double">“Each night you grace zee skies with lights und vonder beyond number, und yet you are scorned by your subjects, who choose to bask in zee gaudy simplicity of your sister&#039;s single sphere! Vhere iz zee justice?! It iz only right zat you take your rightful place as absolute ruler of day <i>und</i> night!”</p><p class="double">“So he&#039;s trying to convince her to maintain the day/night cycle even in victory? I suppose we&#039;ve tried stranger, but most fused Loopers try to prevent victory from the outset,” Rarity commented quietly.</p><p class="double">“He&#039;s kinda a super villain life coach, this is what he does,” Bronco answered.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s, um, very nice and all,” Luna said, reverting to her natural state, “but I&#039;ve had a thousand years to think on it, and I&#039;ve decided that the natural order is fine the way it is. I just really want to reconcile with my sister and sleep in an actual bed.”</p><p class="double">Dusk Contract contemplated for a moment before nodding. “If zat iz your desire, I have no quarrel. Far be it from me to stand in zee vay of love.”</p><p class="double">The ponies gave a collective sigh of relief as Luna stepped off the stage to give Celestia the spotlight.</p><p class="double">Then every window in the building shattered as the doors slammed open, every opening disgorging hundreds of butterflies into the chamber. Their entrance masked the two ponies that followed, concealing them from sight until the swarm swooped up to fly around the ceiling. One was a pegasus stallion who had a deep yellow coat with a short cropped red mane and short pointed beard, three butterflies that somehow seemed menacing emblazoned on his flank. The mare beside him was pale pink with a black mane in a bob cut and a cutie mark of a heart and a syringe.</p><p class="double">“DOCTOR VENTURE! As you have feared in your heart of hearts, I have followed you even here!” The stallion bellowed. “Yes, Venture, there is NOWHERE you can hide! No matter how far you run, how many universes you flee across, whatever form you may take, THE MONARCH will always find you! And now, bolstered by the power of NATURE ITSELF, I will at long last dest-”</p><p class="double">“Dude, calm down, my dad isn&#039;t even here,” a colt with a blue coat and blonde mane interrupted.</p><p class="double">“roy you...” The Monarch trailed off. “Wait, really? Oh. Um. Sorry about that everyone. It&#039;s kind of my thing.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s alright honey,” came the surprisingly deep voice of the mare, “you did a great job, he would have been shaking.”</p><p class="double">“Angel, you&#039;re the best,” he answered before looking around awkwardly. “There an IHOP in this universe? Kinda in the mood for breakfast.”</p><p class="double">“Nonsense,” Dusk stated, trotting for the door, “a home cooked meal is far superior. Come, I vill make zee flapjacks!”</p><p class="double">The native Loopers couldn&#039;t help but stare as their various guests filed out the door, Bronco shrugging at them before following suit.</p><p class="double">“...Ah can&#039;t tell if any o&#039; that violated the sanctuary,” Applejack said after a moment.</p><p class="double">“Seemed like they were having fun to me,” Pinkie chimed in. “And isn&#039;t that what matters?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Sister?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Luna?” Celestia answered over breakfast the next day.</p><p class="double">“Why is there a statue of David Bowie in the garden?”</p><p class="double">Alternate Ending:</p><p class="double">“Luna, I&#039;m not quite sure what I&#039;m looking at here,” Celestia said as she examined the sheaf of papers she&#039;d been given.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a standard Guild arching contract. There&#039;s a schedule for my weekly attacks on the palace on page twelve.” She telekinetically flipped the packet to the proper page.</p><p class="double">“...Weekly attacks on the palace?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I talked it over with Dusk Contract, and he convinced me that it would be healthy to work out any latent anger issues this way. Nopony gets hurt but, well, sometimes it&#039;s nice to just have an out and out fight.”</p><p class="double">Celestia hummed absently and a mischievous glint entered her eye as she reviewed the papers. “Would it be possible to roll back the thursday assault by an hour or so?”</p><p class="double">“I suppose, I only put it that late because I thought you had a meeting with the nobles then.” She blinked as realization hit her. “Sister, I do believe that <i>I</i> am supposed to be the evil mastermind.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.3 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity smiled to herself as she heard a familiar clip clop of hooves and slap of claws behind her, sewing up the final tapestry for this particular Summer Sun celebration.</p><p class="double">&quot;Beautiful....&quot;</p><p class="double">Her ears swivelled for a second.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Spike, the decorations are lovely.&quot;</p><p class="double">There had been the briefest of hesitations in Twilight&#039;s voice. <i>So.</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;Not that! <i>Her!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">That line clinched it. Rarity&#039;s shoulders slumped for a second, before she schooled her face and turned around. From behind the lovestruck little drake, Twilight was giving her an apologetic grimace. She smiled wistfullly, shaking her head and waving it off.</p><p class="double">She trotted down to little Spikey-wikey, keeping herself calm. &quot;It&#039;s good to know that the next generation can recognize true beauty!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... I uh...&quot; The drake blushed, rubbing the back of his head. &quot;You... weren&#039;t supposed to hear that--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; Rarity tittered. &quot;You have most excellent taste, if I do say so myself. Why, you remind me so much of my paramour, I could almost swear you were his brother!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your... paramour.&quot;</p><p class="double">It hurt to see Spike&#039;s heart break like that. But, Rarity knew, it was for the best. Still... Sweetie wasn&#039;t awake this loop... &quot;Why yes. Do you know, I was just telling my younger sister how she needed to find someone to teach her the fine art of discernment.&quot; She leaned in, fluttering her eyelids just so. &quot;Maybe you could help her out with that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike considered the request. &quot;Well... I am, um, kind of busy helping Twilight--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course. Such a responsible young drake! I wouldn&#039;t dream of seperating you from your duty, especially when you&#039;re assisting your sister. Tell you what, though, there&#039;s going to be a party before the celebration proper.&quot; She winked. &quot;I&#039;ll bring my sister, and a few gems.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That sounds nice! Uh, Twilight, do you think--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course we&#039;ll go to the party, Spike.&quot; The scholarly unicorn smiled and nuzzled him gently. &quot;I shouldn&#039;t have stopped us from going to Moondancer&#039;s party in the first place.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike boggled for a few seconds. Then a smug smirk formed on his face. &quot;Loosening up, eh? That&#039;s good.&quot; He took out the checklist, marking something off. &quot;That&#039;s decorations. All that&#039;s left is music!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two of them walked toward the door. Twilight looked back for a brief moment, mouthing something.</p><p class="double"><i>Thank you. Sorry.</p><p class="double"></i>Rarity sighed, shaking her head. <i>Not a problem.</i> She could wait. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.4</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled wistfully as the world clicked into place around her.</p><p class="double">Then blinked. Same library, no book. That means a variant loop.</p><p class="double">Poor Spike and Rarity, assuming both of them were Awake. Variants which didn&#039;t involve a Nightmare Moon could make it quite difficult for the two of them to enjoy their newly married life-</p><p class="double"><i>Wait a second.</p><p class="double">Why is there a dragon wearing armour on the roof spire?</p><p class="double"></i>Loop memories settled, answering her question quite nicely.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Okay, then.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Leave us,” King Spykoran the Just said to his guards. “My student deserves a private audience.”</p><p class="double">Queen Rarity the Wise activated a sound-muffling field for good measure, and as soon as the doors closed Spike grinned.</p><p class="double">“Nice to see you, Twilight,” Rarity said. “Apparently, the admins think we&#039;ve been doing rather good work.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we got a loop as the rulers of Equestria straight off. I think we might actually be in the running for longest honeymoon in history.” Spike shrugged. “I&#039;m hardly complaining.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m happy for you,” Twilight said sincerely, then got a glint in her eye. “Your majesties.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, stop it...” Rarity waved a hoof.</p><p class="double">“So...” Twilight began. “Since there&#039;s no Nightmare Moon and no equivalent villain, any idea what I should do until the Discord incident rolls around?”</p><p class="double">“I... actually have no idea,” Spike admitted. “I know Ponyville&#039;s still there – I remember granting the charter...”</p><p class="double">“Pen friends?” Rarity suggested.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.5 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double">Twilight went over her plan again as the pegasus guards flew her and Spike to Ponyville. She&#039;d picked up a new spellbook in her last fused loop and it had some interesting spells inside that she couldn&#039;t wait to test out. This solo loop would be the perfect place for initial testing.</p><p class="double">At least, she thought that until the chariot came in for a landing in Ponyville. Bubble-gum pink Ponyville.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Guh?&quot; Twilight managed halfway intelligently.</p><p class="double">Okay...so somehow her normal Equestria now contained a Ponyville where Rainbow Dash dressed in style. As the chariot flew off, and Spike unrolled the Official Summer Sun Celebration Overseer&#039;s Checklist (baseline version), Twilight frantically tried to figure out what had gone wrong. Had she overloaded something? Had Trixie blown up something she shouldn&#039;t have?</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my gosh! You&#039;re new!&quot; a cheerful voice with a slight lisp exclaimed.</p><p class="double">Turning her head, Twilight found a certain pink pony smiling at her. It wasn&#039;t her regular Pinkie at all, but the local party-throwing one without any strange powers. Compared to the proper Pinkie Pie, this Pinkie was as bland as oatmeal.</p><p class="double">&#039;<i>I wonder what would happen if she got the Element of Laughter.</i>&#039;</p><p class="double">Mentally, Twilight snagged the errant thought before it could disappear and examined it more closely. Well, aside from the existence of this Ponyville, the rest of the loop was normal baseline...and she did need five extra bearers...why not?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">This time, when the Elements of Harmony activated, it was more like an explosion than an rainbow. Shaking the ringing out of her ears, Twilight took a second to check that yes, Luna was no longer Nightmare Moon, before turning her attention eagerly to her new friends.</p><p class="double">&quot;This necklace is absolutely positively amazing!&quot; Pinkie Pie, Bearer of Laughter exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Darlings, did you see that? We made a rainbow that was absolutely dashing!&quot; said Rainbow Dash, Bearer of Generosity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Golly, I hope we didn&#039;t hit that Nightmare lady too hard,&quot; replied Applejack, Bearer of Honesty.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, *whistle*, we defeated the ultra-big-super-spooky Nightmare *whistle*...can we go home now?&quot; whistled Thistle Whistle, Bearer of Loyalty.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I feel a new song coming on,&quot; Starsong Melody, Bearer of Kindness said to nopony in particular.</p><p class="double">Twilight kept it from showing, but on the inside she was grinning. She&#039;d had more than her fill of being stuck in their boring version of Ponyville. Now, let the social experiment begin! </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sipped her tea, peering at the zebra fiddling with her potions. &quot;You know... you seem to be taking the whole &#039;loops&#039; thing fairly well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is a fair observation,&quot; Zecora replied. &quot;Is that a cause for consternation?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s just... most ponies, when they start looping, have some form of panic attack once in a while.&quot; The librarian leaned back. &quot;Well, not panic exactly. I buried myself in my books, Applejack sorta became listless, Rarity had a goth phase, Pinkie... we don&#039;t talk about that. There&#039;s something they <i>do,</i> something like a mix of existential horror and sheer boredom compelling them at random intervals to just... break character, or hide away. We all get over it pretty quickly, especially with each other&#039;s help, but the thing is I haven’t seen anything like that with you. You&#039;ve just accepted this, and I can&#039;t figure out why.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecora smiled as she poured a few bottles into a cauldron. &quot;My life is based on nature&#039;s rhythm; I do little on some wild whim. These loops are just a larger pattern, one which I can easily learn. Even with fused loops variety, I find my path simple to see.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sipped her tea thoughtfully. &quot;I... see. Huh. Well, alright then. Oh, incidentally, AJ&#039;s got a greenhouse where we gather plants from across the multiverse. Just in case you want to try something new with your alchemy.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Plants from other worlds, you say?&quot; Zecora nodded. &quot;I suppose I could study them today. I would love a chance to improve my art, it would distract me from the weight on my heart.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s ears perked. &quot;...This is about the whole... xenophobia thing, isn&#039;t it. Hmmm.&quot; She tapped her chin thoughtfully. &quot;It would be easy to bring you in as a &#039;foreign correspondent,&#039; or even arrange for you to defeat Nightmare Moon. Actually, it would be easy to attribute her defeat to you, say that you led us to the Elements and boom!&quot;</p><p class="double">The zebra tilted her head. &quot;...I thank you for your offer, Twilight, to remove Ponyville of its bite. Let us see what we can arrange so my entry each loop will change.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.7</p><p class="double">“I think I understand,” Silver said, nodding slowly. “So we each get to pick a kind of ship?”</p><p class="double">“Or lots o&#039; little ones,” Applebloom confirmed. “Though it gets kinda tricky to keep track of &#039;em all, if y&#039;all take that option.”</p><p class="double">“Right. So... I use this computer?”</p><p class="double">“Yep. Design&#039;s fairly intuitive. And it keeps what y&#039;all design secret from th&#039; rest of us, too.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Silver sat down, moving her tail aside, and cracked her paws. “Thanks for the custom seat, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“Well, it was an interesting challenge,” the engineer reassured her. “Ain&#039;t every loop ah even know a diamond dog, let alone have one &#039;round.”</p><p class="double">Silver shot her a teeth-bared grin, then got to typing.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, this&#039;ll be interesting,” Nyx mused, looking down from the cloud. With a tap of a button, her plotting sphere flashed to life. “Okay, guys, get going.”</p><p class="double">She pitched her cloud-tent. Seeing as the starting range on this one was no less than three hundred miles, it was kind of necessary.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Kinda wish ah had a screen...” Scootaloo mused, tapping away at her control board. “Okay, clear decks!”</p><p class="double">Engines flared. Two by two, sixteen fighters climbed clear of the <i>Hurricane</i> and orbited briefly before rocketing off in a search pattern.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo watched them go, then brought up a lift from the hanger deck to start spotting Sea Kings.</p><p class="double">Being hit by a submarine had been kind of funny once. Twice? No thanks.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There were a series of loud <i>splash</i> sounds off the port bow.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo threw <i>Hurricane</i> into a hard starboard turn, baring her teeth as the follow-up shots missed astern.</p><p class="double">That did still leave several questions, though. Her Lightning IICs had a perimeter at fifty miles out, so how had they missed whatever had done that?</p><p class="double">Wait a sec...</p><p class="double">“Silver!” she shouted, as the radar confirmed her guess. “Did you mount railguns?”</p><p class="double">“Guilty,” Silver replied, laughter in her voice. “Hold still, by the way, these shots still take a long time to travel.”</p><p class="double">“Like hay!” Scootaloo tapped on her board, sending the anti-shipping armed aircraft on a reciprocal of the ridiculously high speed shots coming from well over the horizon. Splashes bracketed Hurricane, but there was no real damage, and she started a random-walk evasive pattern.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that reminds me, I sunk Diamond earlier,” Silver volunteered, still cheerful. “She had an Aegis cruiser. You know, the ships with all the missiles.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo sobered a bit. “Yeah, that&#039;s kind of lucky for me. That&#039;s the best matchup you could have had, and the <i>worst</i> for me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why do I even bother with the light ships any more?” Diamond asked, looking glumly at the plotting sphere. “I should try something like an Iowa-class next time – and those nifty nuclear shells they get.”</p><p class="double">“I think that might breach Trixie&#039;s copyright,” Nyx replied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Aww...” Silver whined. “That was the main power feed!”</p><p class="double">“Good to know I got something worthwhile...” Scootaloo rejoined. “Those railguns are nasty in air defence mode.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks!” Silver replied, sounding much happier. “How many of your planes did I get, by the way?”</p><p class="double">“Fourteen Lightning IIC,” Scootaloo answered. “Kinda hurts, too, that&#039;s half my air wing.”</p><p class="double">“I feel for you,” Silver said unsincerely. “Don&#039;t go too far, I&#039;m off to fix the power feed.”</p><p class="double">The connection closed.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo wasted no time in putting all eight reactors to full power and motoring off south at full speed, getting as much distance as possible between her and the railguns.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hey, Sweetie?” Scootaloo asked. “Guess what.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie turned from her periscope. “What?” she returned dutifully.</p><p class="double">“Did you know that LIDAR can pick up submarines at periscope depth?”</p><p class="double">The unicorn leapt for the crash-dive button, but too late. Four homing torpedoes crashed into the water from a pair of Sea Kings, opening the side from bow to stern.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Hi,” Sweetie said morosely. “So much for the idea of an attack sub.”</p><p class="double">“I think we were all expecting you to go sub again after you won last time,” Tiara replied. “This is taking a lot longer than it did before.”</p><p class="double">“I have a Chaos set in my bag,” Nyx volunteered.</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Sweetie said, examining the plotter. “Wait... is Applebloom-”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Tiara looked marginally less sour. “That&#039;s going to be a surprise.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“All right, that&#039;s it,” Scootaloo muttered, as the last of her second strike were torn apart by a repaired aft railgun. “If you want a job doing properly, do it yourself.”</p><p class="double">Setting the carrier on a southward course, she cantered down to the flight deck.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Just one?” Silver asked, shaking her head. “Really not that impressive...”</p><p class="double"><i>PENG</i> went the railgun, making the whole structure shiver with recoil.</p><p class="double">“...huh,” she added, as the speck of colour didn&#039;t disappear. “That&#039;s unusual.”</p><p class="double">The muzzle tracked around smoothly, and spoke again.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that&#039;s getting annoying. Hold still so I can shoot you!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Lightning II jinked sideways in mid air as the thrusters gimballed left, pulling a manoeuvre no conventional plane could match.</p><p class="double">VIFFing was tricky, but very useful.</p><p class="double">With a triumphant grin, Scootaloo launched her missiles directly at the bridge.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was mildly unpleasant,” Silver admitted, scratching behind one ear. “Does it always feel like that?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, it does,” Tiara answered for her. “Better than exploding, though.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha.” Silver removed the teleport harness. “Okay, where&#039;s Applebloom?”</p><p class="double">They pointed at the plotting sphere.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Okay.” The currently-a-Diamond-Dog looked at the board. “Hey, I&#039;m not all that up on the rules... can you deal me in?”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Tiara said, placing a card on the table. “I&#039;m playing Minion, along with Sudden But Inevitable Betrayal.”</p><p class="double">“What does that do?” Nyx asked, picking up the rulebook.</p><p class="double">Tiara gestured to Silver to pull up... well, some cloud. “Well, Minion lets me draft any one non-playing person around the table in as a player who has to do what I say – and I pick Silver. Sudden But Inevitable Betrayal would have cost me points if I&#039;d ended the game without playing it, but it means you don&#039;t have to do what I say any more.”</p><p class="double">“Cool. Thanks.” Silver dealt herself some cards. “...what does a walrus have to do with anything?”</p><p class="double">“Discord,” they chorused.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo landed on the flight deck with the satisfaction of a job well done.</p><p class="double">But, glad as she was to have sorted out Silver before she ran out of planes, there was still that one problem.</p><p class="double">“...okay, where the hay is Applebloom? Game&#039;s not over yet...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">High above Equestria, Applebloom permitted herself a satisfied smile.</p><p class="double">Sure, they were probably going to accuse her of cheating again. But she&#039;d only specified the tech level.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d never said it had to be a <i>sea</i> ship.</p><p class="double">The hold of her SSTO flyer opened, releasing a little over one hundred dense iron spheres.</p><p class="double">“Look out below!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.8</p><p class="double">“Right, this looks vaguely familiar,” Twilight said, looking out over the deep coniferous forests cloaking the mountain behind her. As a precaution, since she was human, she withdrew OWL&#039;s current chassis from her pocket and slipped the bracelet onto her wrist. “But where from?”</p><p class="double">Footfalls sounded behind her.</p><p class="double">“I assume you&#039;re Awake?” a voice said from behind her.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” she replied, turning. “Oh, right, of course. This is Berk, right?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right, yeah.” Hiccup nodded. “Looks baseline so far, except that you&#039;re here, and... huh.”</p><p class="double">“What?”</p><p class="double">In answer, a little black fire-lizard about a foot long flashed into being between them.</p><p class="double">“Toothless isn&#039;t his normal size,” Hiccup explained, holding his arm out for his sort-of-co-anchor. “That certainly means something&#039;s up. Not sure what, though.”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought a bit, then shrugged. “Oh well. Any ideas?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, actually...” Hiccup paused. “How would you feel about staging a bout of divine visitation? If the village thinks we&#039;re favoured by...”</p><p class="double">“I think just the ones who are our loop patrons, actually,” Twilight suggested. “It&#039;s easier.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds good. Wonder how I&#039;ll explain Framherja, though, I was going to go for Thor.” Hiccup shrugged. “I&#039;ll think of something.”</p><p class="double">“Framherja?” Twilight asked. “I&#039;m not familiar with the name...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right. Framherja is a bow I pick up in a variant loop. It took <i>ages</i>, but I finally managed to get her properly soul-bound.” Putting action to words, he held out his hand and a <i>gorgeous</i> golden bow flashed into being.</p><p class="double">“Until then I had to rely on her being my standard-issue legendary weapon. She&#039;s basically partially sentient,” he explained. “Sort of like your Device – Owl, I think?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, is that the one you used in Valdemar? And yes, that&#039;s right.”</p><p class="double">A roar echoed over the valleys of the island.</p><p class="double">“Toothless?” Hiccup asked, a note of command in his voice.</p><p class="double"><i>Two. Large – my normal size.</i> The little dragon was looking up and into the distance. <i>They&#039;re... oh, right. I think this is who&#039;s filling in the Night Fury slot.</p><p class="double"></i>Toothless&#039; mental tone was mildly aggrieved. <i>That&#039;s my gig.</p><p class="double"></i>“Not this time.” Hiccup raised the arm holding Toothless in an expansive gesture. “You can be the sarcastic one who constantly throws barbs at us and never has to do any work.”</p><p class="double"><i>I like this new gig.</p><p class="double"></i>The two Furies were now close enough for the humans to see them. Hiccup casually fingered Framherja&#039;s string – not intending to draw, precisely, just not wanting to be caught off guard if he <i>had</i> to draw.</p><p class="double">Then, with a rush of wind, they both landed heavily down-slope.</p><p class="double">“Hi!” a cheerful voice called.</p><p class="double">“Spike?” Twilight checked. “Nice to see you here. Wait... is that-”</p><p class="double">“Indeed it is, dear.” Seeing a thirty foot Night Fury speak with Rarity&#039;s voice was slightly strange, to say the least. “Well, this is convenient.”</p><p class="double">“Might not be all that convenient in the future,” Twilight warned. “I suspect you&#039;ll end up being my dragon for the loop.”</p><p class="double">Rarity considered this. “Things have been worse.”</p><p class="double">“True.” Twilight turned back to her (for this loop, anyway) twin brother. “What was that you were saying about faking divine favour?”</p><p class="double"><i>This is going to be good,</i> Toothless opined.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.9</p><p class="double">“Okay, which of us has the most screwed up family this loop?” Scootaloo asked. “I mean, this is getting silly.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom shrugged. “Same as normal for me. Pretty borin&#039;, actually.”</p><p class="double">“My mother appears to have been secretly a noblewoman,” Diamond contributed. “That&#039;s fairly unusual. No idea who, though.”</p><p class="double">“What a scandal!” Silver grinned.</p><p class="double">“And we all know what&#039;s after bein&#039; your thing,” Applebloom said, pointing. “I mean, Changeling.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, well...” Silver shrugged. She&#039;d shifted into her earth pony filly “default” as soon as possible, but they all knew the reality.</p><p class="double">“As far as I can tell, my parents were gang members,” Scootaloo provided, and the others winced.</p><p class="double">“I think I might still have a shot at winning,” Sweetie temporized.</p><p class="double">“Why?” Scootaloo asked. “Your family is just about the most stable thing apart from Applebloom&#039;s.”</p><p class="double">“My brother in law is a shapeshifting dragon,” Sweetie reminded them.</p><p class="double">“My elder sister or sort of twin and kind of parent is Princess Luna, my sorta aunt it&#039;s complicated is Celestia, and my other kind of parent is Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">The others looked at Nyx.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, okay, easy win,” Scootaloo grumbled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.10</p><p class="double">Fluttershy felt the loop initiate around her, wobbled for a moment on two legs, and steadied herself.</p><p class="double">“What-” a familiar voice said.</p><p class="double">“Hello, Leman,” she replied, smiling as she turned. “Good to see you.”</p><p class="double">“And you, little mother,” Russ replied, spreading his broad arms for an embrace.</p><p class="double">“I see I&#039;m human,” Fluttershy said, looking down at herself once they separated.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I... think you&#039;re my adoptive mother, this time,” Russ confirmed. “And you also appear to be immune to ageing, which is convenient.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded, taking that in. “I see. So this is back on Fenris?”</p><p class="double">“It is indeed.” Russ paused. “I&#039;m sorry, little mother. It seems likely that you&#039;re going to see a side of me you&#039;d rather not, this time.”</p><p class="double">The ersatz human frowned. “Um... what do you mean?”</p><p class="double">Russ unbuckled his weapon belt and slipped off his armour, leaving him clad in a standard Fenrisian five-layered summer tunic. “Little mother, this is a baseline loop, save only for your presence. I...”</p><p class="double">He sat, heavily.</p><p class="double">“The Dark Millennium is one of the nastiest places in the multiverse, simply because of the sheer scale of the problem. Normally, it&#039;s much easier to cope – I have my trusted right hand, Bjorn, and I have Freki and Geri, and normally I have either my Father or at least one of the Chaos Gods on-side, nowadays. But...”</p><p class="double">The big Primarch shook his head. “I already checked. No Emperor, no helpful God to help reduce the scale of things. And last time you were here, your friends – the Elements – were with us. All six of you together makes a potent force of order, and quells the madness before it spirals out of control. And-”</p><p class="double">Russ slammed his fist into the arm of the chair, smashing it to bits. “I am only one man. I can usually preserve the Imperium, make sure it stays what it has the potential to be, but at the cost of an ocean of blood.”</p><p class="double">He finally looked back at Fluttershy, and there were tears glistening in his eyes. “Every time, I must win peace with millions of dead, spend the lives of my men like coin. I... I don&#039;t want to subject you to that, dear Fluttershy. Mother.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy was silent for several seconds.</p><p class="double">“I think I see. And...”</p><p class="double">She sighed herself.</p><p class="double">“I know – when I think about it, I know what you must have to go through. I know you, Lemon.”</p><p class="double">Neither of them noticed the slight shift in her pronunciation.</p><p class="double">“I raised you, and I know it was a long time ago, but... I do know you. The kind of man you are, and the kind you aren&#039;t. And I, I...”</p><p class="double">She took a breath.</p><p class="double">“I trust you, Lemon. I know that if you go to war, it&#039;s only because it&#039;s better in the long run. You&#039;re <i>right</i> that I don&#039;t like death. I hate that it has to happen, and I don&#039;t hate it less because of the way the loops reset things. But I&#039;m a druid, as well. A student of nature. Predators – wolves – have to eat, and I know nature isn&#039;t all fluffy bunnies, and so long as they&#039;re not cruel about it then I can cope.”</p><p class="double">“And,” she added, “I&#039;m going to help you in every way I can.”</p><p class="double">Russ stared at her for a long moment.</p><p class="double">“Thank you, mother,” he said eventually. “That means a lot to me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken two months for Fluttershy to get properly in tune with her druid nature in the new body.</p><p class="double">Five for her to get her studies of the Fenrisian wolf down to the detail necessary.</p><p class="double">And, finally, about two days for her to pick the precise traits she wanted to add.</p><p class="double">But now, floating above Fenris in a glow of the steely-blue natural magic of a world of ice, she was ready to try the best way she could think of to help her son.</p><p class="double">“Origin of Species.”</p><p class="double">A fraction of her soul, the accumulated power of dozens of normal lifetimes&#039; experience, burned itself as fuel.</p><p class="double">A spark lit, and raced outwards, covering the whole planet and rippling like an aurora.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you alright?” Leman asked, as Fluttershy came round.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m... fine, thank you,” she said quietly. “Did it work?”</p><p class="double">“Well, if you were trying what I think you were trying, then yes.” Leman stepped aside, and the – nonawake – pair of wolves he raised padded over to the bed.</p><p class="double">“Thank you, mother-of-our-pack,” one said in a deep, smooth voice. “How to speak as two-legged-pack do is a great gift.”</p><p class="double">The other licked her face. “Now, get some sleep. You are tired.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled as she sank back into bed again.</p><p class="double">It was much easier to ignore a sentient race that couldn&#039;t talk, than one that could. Assuming things went in a way similar to normal when the Emperor turned up, the fierce loyalty of the Wolves of Fenris should go a way towards cracking his entrenched xenophobia.</p><p class="double">Now, how to deal with the Eldar...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.11</p><p class="double">The Ursa advanced on Ponyville. Again.</p><p class="double">“Any ideas?” Trixie asked. “Trixie could go with the old bear-out-of-the-hat routine, but that is getting old...”</p><p class="double">“My brother wanted to try something,” Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">Theme music started playing.</p><p class="double">With a gale of wind from broad, feathered wings, an alicorn clad head-to-hoof in spandex landed in the town square.</p><p class="double">“Fear not, proud citizens of Equestria!” a male voice belled from the strange apparition. His costume was white trimmed with gold and black trimmed with purple, the royal colours, and a prominent &#039;E&#039; was displayed over where his cutie mark would be.</p><p class="double">“What.”</p><p class="double">Twilight covered her mouth with a hoof, glancing over at Trixie. “What? Never seen Captain Equestria before?”</p><p class="double">Trixie rolled her eyes, as the Ursa lashed out with a clawed paw at &#039;Captain Equestria&#039;.</p><p class="double">The blow bounced off his mane with a <i>clang.</p><p class="double"></i>“It just seems ridiculous,” Trixie admitted, as Shining advanced. “I mean, I get the whole &#039;he has an invulnerable shield&#039; thing, but...”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “He felt like it, ultimately. Besides, his mane looks funny when it&#039;s floor length – he keeps it that length the whole time, you know, he doesn&#039;t use a spell to regrow it or anything.”</p><p class="double">She coughed. “We may have a bet on as to how long it&#039;ll take someone to work it out.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight trotted up to the throne where her former mentor sat, clearing her throat. &quot;Celestia, I&#039;ve had some time to think and I just wanted to ask you about something.&quot;</p><p class="double">The alicorn smiled. &quot;Twilight, you know I&#039;m open to answering anything you ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia, you&#039;ve got a great voice, why is it I hardly ever hear you sing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that one&#039;s really easy. I&#039;m just not up to the task!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But aren&#039;t we singing now?&quot; asked Twilight. &quot;With this rhythm and these varying tones?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Twilight, but this is <i>heartsong,</i> music that comes from our bones.&quot; Celestia shook her head and blushed. &quot;It&#039;s true, when music is magic, I&#039;m as elegant as a diva, but when it comes to ordinary singing, it seems I have the fever. I&#039;m tone deaf! Rhythmically stymied! Four left hooves and no beat in my brain. Every time I opened my mouth, ponies would look at me as if I were insane.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know the feeling,&quot; Twilight admitted. &quot;I just can&#039;t dance. Not without magical support! I&#039;d probably crush the hooves of any stallion that I attempted to court. But then everypony gets up, compelled by the strongest heartsong, and I always get up and join them, swaying and swinging along!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why can&#039;t we do this without magic?&quot; they sang as they circled round the throne room. &quot;Why are we utter trash on the floor?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t hum a tune!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d be clumsy on the moon!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why must our songs always come from our core? It&#039;s true that they always mean <i>something</i> but we sometimes want to sing and dance for fun! Why can&#039;t we do this without maaaaaaagiiiiiiiic? Answer us! Anyone!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.13 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double">&quot;I feel stupid in this hat,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, adjusting the offending garment.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s only for the game,&quot; Rarity replied.</p><p class="double">While Dash was getting used to what she insisted was a very &#039;fru-fru&#039; outfit, Rarity was making minute changes to the rest of the costumes. Oh, after all these loops reining herself in to keep the costumes simple was a new challenge for Rarity.</p><p class="double">Finally, she sat back and looked over her work with a smile. Everypony&#039;s costume was perfectly suited to their role, if not exactly their personal taste. A rough-and-ready yellow for Applejack, purple tweed for Twilight, slinky red for Pinkie, a soft peach with lace for Fluttershy, and the iconic maid&#039;s outfit for Rarity herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where is everypony else anyway?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked, once Rarity helped her escape the feathers and silk so it could be put away with the rest.</p><p class="double">&quot;Building the mansion in Everfree.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks for the help, Zecora,&quot; Twilight said as the zebra paced around the chosen clearing checking their measurements.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy had already relocated all the wildlife that would have otherwise been displaced by their game, so all there was left was to build the &#039;board&#039; for this game.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight my friend, this help is truly no trouble at all for me,&quot; Zecora said, nodding and bracing herself, &quot;I should be thanking you, for allowing my practice in the Art of the Tree.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a surge of chakra, trees began erupting, twisting around themselves to form floors, walls, and a roof.</p><p class="double">&quot;You said you got this skill from a Naruto fused loop, right?&quot; Twilight asked, absently checking Naruto&#039;s entry on her list of Hub fiction and noting that it needed updating at the next possible opportunity.</p><p class="double">&quot;A strange world to visit, and stranger to stay,&quot; Zecora agreed, &quot;Especially after becoming their First Hokage.&quot;</p><p class="double">Behind Twilight, Pinkie and Fluttershy were sorting through a huge pile of furniture, tiles, wallpaper, and various decorative knick-knacks.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">One appropriately dark and stormy night later, all six friends stood in the foyer of their newly built and opulently decorated mansion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, we&#039;re ready Spike!&quot; Twilight called.</p><p class="double">Spike walked in from the Study wearing a nice dinner jacket.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, here we go...I&#039;m Mister Boddy. Welcome to my mansion...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Right then, Ah <i>accuse</i> Professor Plum,&quot; Colonel Mustard said, &quot;Of murdering Mr. Boddy in the Kitchen with the Rope!&quot;</p><p class="double">The others waited as the envelope containing the real details of the murder was opened, and the contents examined privately by the Colonel. ...Who promptly threw down her hat in frustration.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tarnation - Ah got it wrong! An&#039; that means Ah&#039;m out!&quot; Applejack groaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, that means you have to wait in the Foyer with Spike,&quot; Professor Plum said, smiling apologetically, &quot;Better luck next time?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Miss Scarlet bounced around, whooping, while the rest of the mares looked over the contents of the folder.</p><p class="double">&quot;So <i>Mrs. White</i> murdered Mr. Boddy, in the Billards Room, with the Candlestick?&quot; Mrs. Peacock said, &quot;...Rarity, why&#039;d you murder your husband like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The cards are totally random, I assure you,&quot; Mrs. White sniffed.</p><p class="double">Spike nodded vigorously in agreement. Then asked under his breath, &quot;You&#039;re going to keep that maid outfit, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s reply was a sultry wink. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.14 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">Chrysalis trotted into the mayoral office, glancing at the mare behind the desk. &quot;You wanted to see me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll nodded, walking over to the door and shutting it. &quot;I... have a personal favor I want to ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen rose an eyebrow as she observed the mayor of Ponyville. &quot;Go on...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... you see, during Spike and Rarity&#039;s... prewedding party, I came to realize that I have certain, ah, tastes. Tastes which are... unique, making it difficult for me to find another pony that shares them.&quot; Ivory tapped her hooves nervously. &quot;But, well... you changelings have a hive mind, and so I was wondering if perhaps you might find a drone who&#039;d--&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis held up a hoof. &quot;Before we go any further, I just want to explain a few things. Even with the hive mind, any drone I choose won&#039;t remember you between loops. They might remember what I recall--if I&#039;m awake--but they won&#039;t feel it in their heart.&quot; Her eyes drifted downward. &quot;It&#039;s the same thing with anypony, really; relationships with nonloopers or even those that just aren&#039;t awake that loop are going to hurt, because no matter how deep the bond you develop it&#039;ll be wiped clean when the loop resets. So don&#039;t look for love with anypony who isn&#039;t already... well, you know. Looping.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Believe me... you&#039;ll never stop regretting it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mayor nodded. &quot;Wise words. But, uh... I&#039;m only looking for, ah, a good time.&quot; She blushed. &quot;Um... with a rugged fellow, as it were.&quot;</p><p class="double">Instantly Chrysalis relaxed. &quot;I am so glad you realize that. You wouldn&#039;t believe how many ponies confuse lust for love, I swear to Fagales... In that case, why don&#039;t you tell me what you need and I&#039;ll see who you can recommend.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Certainly. Can... can we keep this between us, though?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose,&quot; Chrysalis mused. &quot;I mean, I can see why you ponies usually require romance as a prerequisite, what with the long pregnancies and all, but I&#039;m still not sure why you&#039;re so squeamish talking about it...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mayor Mare--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ivory Scroll.&quot; The mayor smiled. &quot;Just had it changed. Again. I&#039;m making it my &#039;real&#039; name for the loops, you see, and there are some advantages to my position.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Yes, well. My apologies. But I need to talk to you about....&quot; She glanced at the door, shutting it. &quot;Well, about your request to Chrysalis.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you hear about that?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Berry Punch told me after she got her and Trixie drunk.&quot; The unicorn rolled her eyes. &quot;Apparently they just started making out on the bar so she left... whatever, that&#039;s not the point.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a long sigh, the earth pony slumped into her chair. &quot;I know, I know. It&#039;s unusual, certainly--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s also one of the first signs of Sakura Syndrome,&quot; Twilight interrupted. &quot;A desperate need to find new things, just to break the monotony of the loops–!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle, do you really think that I of all ponies cannot cope with monotony?&quot; The mayor picked up a stack of papers for emphasis. &quot;Regularity is a constant comfort to me, the swishing of pens and quills on stacks of papers. It&#039;s just that I also find certain... that a particular sort of thing also, ahem, tickles my fancy. I&#039;m not addicted to my practices by any means, and believe it or not this job of mine requires I submit to psychological profiling at regular intervals. I have no intention or interest in ending the loops, or traumatizing anypony in them.&quot; She gave the unicorn a flat look. &quot;Something I believe Eternal Twilight knows a bit about.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blushed. &quot;You, ah... heard about that. Right.&quot; She shook her head, focusing and glaring sternly at the mayor. &quot;Alright, I&#039;ll let this go for now. But can I trust that if you ever do feel... desperate, or listless, you&#039;ll come to us?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Sparkle, I Pinkie Promise – with full awareness of miss Pie&#039;s Chaotic abilities – that should I ever feel the weight of ages crushing upon me I will seek counsel with my fellow immortals. Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye...&quot; The mayor tapped her hoof. &quot;Hmm. That last one might actually be fun, come to think of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A-huh.&quot; Twilight coughed. &quot;Well then. I&#039;ll just be going.&quot; She backed out of the office, watching the other mare warily.</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll rolled her eyes. &quot;I&#039;m just signing papers, Twilight, I keep my naughty business at home. Please relax.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;You know,&quot; mused Thorax as he bristled his moustache, &quot;this isn&#039;t exactly what I expected when the Queen asked me to help you out.&quot; He watched the mayor swing, following the white ball with his eyes as it sailed over the course.</p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll shrugged. &quot;Right now, we&#039;re just relaxing. We&#039;ll get down to... business later.&quot; She pulled out a large club and examined it. &quot;Hmm... this one&#039;s very nice. You should use it.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">52.15 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Sure you can have some of my blood, Mister Alucard. Wait, is that what you were trying to do when we were playing tag? I always get those two confused, maybe because I&#039;m such a good tag player. Twilight won&#039;t play with me since she&#039;s busy in a library or something, but I don&#039;t mind. I can be very sweet, too. I suppose that&#039;s why everything wants to eat me,&quot; Pinkie held out her hoof to the panting vampire. He had been chasing her constantly for three weeks. Ever since Pinkie annoyed Sir Integra enough that she told him to go and have a taste.</p><p class="double">Slowly he lowered his fangs over the pink pony.</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled. &quot;That tickles!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sir Integra frowned as she saw the annoying pink pony continue to bounce around town, but now with two little band-aids on her front hoof. Walking inside, she spoke to the groaning, bloated, bed-ridden vampire lord.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you know they had to come up with a new classification system?

<p>53.1 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack trotted through the orchards, humming to herself as she examined the trees. Normally Apple Bloom would be here too, but ever since she met those two new friends of hers she&#039;d been off crusading for her cutie mark or... something. Honestly, the strange words pouring out of the filly&#039;s mouth were almost incomprehensible, and if it weren&#039;t for Twilight assuring her that yes, her sister was actually talking about science, she&#039;d have had the foal sent to the hospital. Still, it was good to know she was finally expanding her circle of friends; even if she stayed on the farm, Applejack would never have wanted her to be a distant member of society that only talked to the trees.</p><p class="double">Not that there was anything wrong with trees. It was just... ponies were social. That&#039;s how Things Worked.</p><p class="double">Her ears perked suddenly; an odd whirring and grating sound could be heard from... somewhere. &quot;What in tarnation...?&quot; She turned, walking briskly after the noise and wondering what could possibly be causing it. Some sort of cart? A winch? Maybe an injured animal, she&#039;d have to get Flutter...</p><p class="double">...shy...</p><p class="double">Her jaw dropped at the sight of three strange suits of armor, awkwardly walking in circles around one of her trees.</p><p class="double">&quot;...um.&quot; Applejack swallowed. &quot;Hello there... sirs?&quot;</p><p class="double">The earth pony suit turned its silvery visage to her. Without warning the face folded <i>back</i> and <i>in-</i> &quot;Heya sis! Sorry, we&#039;re still getting used to this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A...Apple Bloom?&quot; Applejack boggled at the tiny head sticking out of the thick armor. &quot;What are you... what is this?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh... these. Right, these are armor modes of our intelligent devices. Got them round... Nightmare Night.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Intelligent Devices...?</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a long story.&quot; The young filly rolled her eyes. &quot;Short version, soulbonded. So me and the girls decided to practice working through the Robotic Armor and Partner mode. Don&#039;t worry, we&#039;re just walking around for now, nothing major.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...soulbonded.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eyup! Oh Sweetie Belle, watch out for that--&quot; Apple Bloom winced as the unicorn tripped up. &quot;...root. Dang it. Uh, sorry AJ, I think she forgot to turn on her mike again... I&#039;ll have to go back in and radio her.&quot; The metal scales once more enveloped her face, and she staggered over to the fallen silver figure to help her up.</p><p class="double">Applejack blinked. Twice. Then, slowly, she backed away. Twilight would make sense of this. She knew about Nightmare Moon, somehow, she could probably explain all this craziness. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">53.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait wait wait,&quot; Silver Spoon (currently Silvana Spoonscale of the Lonely Mountain) managed. &quot;You can <i>all</i> turn into <i>alicorns?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmyep. It&#039;s not just something we can teach ya, though,&quot; Apple Bloom pointed out. &quot;Even if&#039;n ya were a pony and not a dragon, ya&#039;d have ta... well, do something really special with yer cutie mark.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you can&#039;t force it,&quot; Scootaloo added. &quot;Trust me, I tried a heck of a lot of things before Cloudsdale... it&#039;ll happen when it happens, is what I&#039;m saying.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa.&quot; The dragoness turned to her pink friend. &quot;Even you?&quot;</p><p class="double">In answer, Diamond Tiara produced a cosmic spectrum gem and Ascended, flicking her wings out as her mane transformed inton a bedazzling matrix of crystals. She posed for a moment... before shutting Silvana&#039;s mouth with a small smirk. &quot;Yes, yes, I know I&#039;m pretty.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How do you get your mane to do that?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Comes with being an alicorn.&quot; Sweetie flashed her own pair of wings into existence. &quot;It&#039;s different for each of us though. Me, my mane doesn&#039;t <i>look</i> any diferent, but...&quot; She shook her head and the sounds of a powerful orchestra filled the clubhouse. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx rolled her eyes. &quot;Now she&#039;s going to want to see all of ours, guys, and you know I don&#039;t like mine...&quot;</p><p class="double">Silvana shrugged. &quot;If you&#039;re too embaressed, I guess we can skip it. For now.&quot; She turned to the other two fillies. &quot;What about you guys?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo produced a horn and began trotting around the room, her mane willowing away in an invisible gale and forming patterns of wings and clouds. At first, the dragoness thought she would go bald, but then she realized that there always seemed to be more mane underneath the old one.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mine&#039;s a bit practical,&quot; Apple Bloom admitted as she joined the alicorn club, the red metallic tendrils and wires on her skull reaching out and grabbing some scrap. Within moments, they had transformed it into a small cog. &quot;Who am Ah kidding, it&#039;s a lot practical! But it tends ta creep ponies out, so... yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh.&quot; Silvana turned to Nyx. &quot;Are you sure you don&#039;t want to--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, I replaced the Shadow Pony this loop.&quot; Nyx tilted her head and concentrated. &quot;I wonder if that changes anything.... Oh wow! Bats and spiders, that&#039;s new!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">53.3 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was deeply ambivalent about her Coronation Day.</p><p class="double">Or to be more accurate, she was ambivalent about the events leading to it.</p><p class="double">When faced with a lonely baseline Loop that had progressed without significant deviation – if she didn&#039;t feel like bothering with the whole Coronation business, she&#039;d have diverged from the baseline long before this point – and the delivery of a particular book shortly after returning from assisting the Crystal Empire in securing the Equestria Games, nine times out of ten she&#039;d skip the cutie-mark crisis, wait a few days, then show up on the Celestial plane fully Ascended. Her explanation to the unawake Celestia would usually go along the lines of: &quot;Well, I spent a fair amount of time pondering Starswirl&#039;s notes and consulting some other sources.” For some reason, she never mentioned that she had written several of those sources. &quot;Obviously, the spell is a transmogrification matrix meant to re-apportion a pony&#039;s innate magic, and uses the symbology of the cutie-mark to...&quot; and so on.</p><p class="double">But taking the easy way out meant losing the songs. Chloroplasts and xylem, she still liked the songs. (For the most part: Her coronation hymn did get old fairly quickly...)</p><p class="double">Yes, she had recordings. For that matter, the DVDs from the Hub loop were amazingly good covers of the originals; one of these loops, she&#039;d send the vocal performers her compliments. But there was nothing like a live performance, and Celestia&#039;s singing was such a rare treat.</p><p class="double">So that tenth time, she&#039;d play the incident as straight as possible.</p><p class="double">It was never as simple as that, of course. Variant loops would alter the cutie-mark reassignments. (Pinkie the weatherpony was a particularly odd version.) And there was that lingering guilt about having subjected her friends, even if unawake, to the stress of tinkering with their destinies to such an extent.</p><p class="double">So here she stood on the balcony in her coronation gown with her reworked Element of Magic tiara on her head. Her plans for this loop required that she follow through with the ceremony after her public Ascension.</p><p class="double">This time around, she&#039;d even made ultra-definition holorecordings of all the songs in their baseline forms. She&#039;d been hoping for the super-rare speed metal cover versions, but you took what you could get.</p><p class="double">On reflection, her enthusiasm about the ceremony itself had also waned over the subjective millennia. She&#039;d had limited success in changing the coronation hymn; her pull with Court Composer Treble Clef was negligible, so it took considerable effort to modify the official musical program. At least she could usually arrange for Rarity to make the coronation gowns, so Luna was seldom put in that maroon monstrosity: This time, Luna was wearing an elegant midnight blue number with turquoise and silver accents.</p><p class="double">&quot;Say something, Princess,&quot; coaxed Celestia.</p><p class="double">But that didn&#039;t mean that she&#039;d be giving the original &quot;Luckiest Pony&quot; speech. Point of fact, she almost never did after the first few times. Over the loops, she&#039;d had the time to refine her thoughts and produce several different speeches employing tricks she&#039;d picked up from the greatest orators in the multiverse. She usually stuck to the themes of her gratitude to Princess Celestia for giving her the opportunity to investigate the magic of friendship and her fortune in having found such wonderful friends. It still took many attempts to get the reactions she&#039;d wanted; her first attempt at reworking the Gettysburg Address to suit the occasion (&quot;Two score and seventeen months ago, Princess Celestia sent me forth to Ponyville...&quot;) had not gone over particularly well.</p><p class="double">During particularly stir-crazy loops she&#039;d experimented with diatribes against the institution of the Diarchy, reasoned arguments supporting a written Constitution to circumscribe the power of the Dual Thrones, satirical orations on the topic of anarchy...</p><p class="double">And then there was the time she&#039;d been struck with an irresistible attack of limericks.</p><p class="double">Today was rather like that one. She had an itch that just wouldn&#039;t go away until she got it out of her system.</p><p class="double">Some time before the start of the ceremonies, she&#039;d hidden a compact sound system on the balcony. Stealthily, she triggered the pre-arranged opening bars of her melody. Luna and Celestia shared a startled look as something vaguely resembling a heart-song began to take hold. Twilight suppressed a grin and started singing.</p><p class="double"><i>I am the very model of a Princess of Equestria</i></p><p><i>(Though) my mane is not ethereal like Luna or Celestia</i></p><p><i>I&#039;d begun investigation of the legendary Nightmare Moon</i></p><p><i>And prophecy suggested her return would take place very soon</i></p><p class="double"><i>The rustic town of Ponyville was set to host the solstice fest</i></p><p><i>My mentor sent me there to check that preparations were their best</i></p><p><i>With new-found friends I ventured forth into the forest Everfree</i></p><p><i>To seek out the location of the Elements of Harmony</i></p><p class="double">Her friends had emerged onto the balcony behind her and took up the part of the chorus.</p><p class="double"><i>There was this reference book about the Elements of Harmony</i></p><p><i>To defeat Nightmare Moon we&#039;d need the Elements of Harmony</i></p><p><i>So we went out to try to find the missing Elements of Harmony</i></p><p class="double">They subsided to let her resume the solo part.</p><p class="double"><i>Within the ancient castle we did meet the Princess of the Night</i></p><p><i>With elements of friendship she was cured in arcs of rainbow light</i></p><p><i>So glad was I to reunite dear Luna with Celestia</i></p><p><i>I&#039;m pleased to have restored a current Princess of Equestria</i></p><p class="double">The chorus ended the verse.</p><p class="double"><i>So glad was she to reunite dear Luna with Celestia</i></p><p><i>She&#039;s pleased to have restored a current Princess of Equestria</i></p><p class="double">The tempo slowed.</p><p class="double"><i>Now resident in Ponyville, my friendship research did progress</i></p><p><i>Distractions such as hungry swarms of parasprites sure made a mess</i></p><p><i>The Gala, grand and galloping caused expectations to inflate</i></p><p><i>(Poor Rarity discovered that Prince Blueblood was a horrid date)</i></p><p class="double">Rarity put on an affronted expression.

Chrysalis had turned out to be Awake this Loop, so nothing had happened at that point, but the Crystal Empire had shown up right on time, and they had headed off to deal with King Sombra.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Crys-tals!&quot; Sombra flowed into the city as Candance&#039;s barrier fell. His dark gaze swept across the crowds of terrified crystal ponies, before stopping on a single, ordinary brown pegasus. The pegasus was flipping a small green crystal from wing to wing. Sombra started forward again, shadow sliding off of him. &quot;Crys-tal!&quot; Link smirked, before reaching back under his wing and pulling out...</p><p class="double">Twilight almost fell over. Link had just pulled out an oversized Butterfly Net from under his wing. Fluttershy shifted nervously. &quot;Oh dear.&quot; Twilight glanced at Sombra and then paused. Sombra was standing, transfixed, swaying slightly in time with the sweeping of the oversized net. Link walked forward, until he was right in front of Sombra, and he proceeded to whack him on the nose.</p><p class="double">Sombra reared back, startled. His eyes focused again, and a dark bolt gathered on the end of his horn. The air screamed as the dark spell leapt towards Link. Sombra didn&#039;t have a chance to react as Link swung the net again, and the spell came rocketing back to smash into Sombra&#039;s face.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared in shock at the twitching pile that had used to be Sombra. Somehow, Link had beat him with only that net, alternating between hypnotizing him by waving it, and playing tennis with every spell Sombra threw at him.</p><p class="double">&quot;H-how?&quot;</p><p class="double">Link shrugged, and Fluttershy giggled. &quot;&#039;What works, works. My world is kind of odd like that.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">53.5 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double">Macintosh Apple watched the stallion slumped on the impromptu bar in the Acres&#039; cellar guzzle down a glass of The Good Stuff. It was the third of its kind in almost as many minutes. Probably wasn&#039;t good for said stallion to be drinking watered-down cider at that rate, and that wasn&#039;t watered-down cider. However, after what the newcomer had told him was true, the poor guy needed few stiff drinks. </p><p class="double">&quot;So lemme see if ah got this straight.&quot; </p><p class="double">The stallion raised an eyebrow and made a gesture indicating he wanted another cider. Mac considered withholding this drink, for the good of his customer. Who had apparently Awoken in a cold sweat on the outskirts of Ponyville, before being brought in by an uncharacteristically serious Pinkie Pie. He slid the requested beverage over to his customer as he continued. </p><p class="double">&quot;Every loop y&#039;all is in, regardless of universe, th&#039; universe itself seems to have it out for ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unfortunate stallion took a long draft from the cider, placing it half-full back on the counter. </p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. I&#039;ve been thrown out of spaceships, tortured by some french guy, ripped apart by a negative reality wedgie, reset to factory settings as an AI, torn to bits by a werewolf, disintegrated, defenestrated, you name it, I&#039;ve lived it, if not necessarily through it. Lately though, I&#039;ve been getting run over by a traction city, blown up by a supervolcano, punched out by a burning dude, dropped down an elevator shaft by some idiot in orange power armor, had my elephant killed from under me by some girly elf, squished by a giant mechanical lobster, crashed into a redwood on a speeder bike, eaten by a giant snake, all kinds of weird deaths. Never seen a loop through to its end.&quot; </p><p class="double">Mac began wiping out another tankard. Might as well have the next ready for when the rest of the current one disappeared. </p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; ye&#039;ve tried to avoid it?&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded. </p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know what I, or some version of me, did to deserve it, but yes. If I know it&#039;s coming and avoid it, then another accident happens. No matter what I do, something always kills me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh smiled. Being the bearer of good news was always nice. </p><p class="double">&quot;Hrm, ah&#039;m not sure if Pinkie mentioned it, but we here in Equestria consider ourselves a sanctuary of sorts. If&#039;n you want a break, Twilight and anypony else Awake, including mahself, will try our best to keep ya safe. An&#039; we ponies are kinda durable folk, ah once saw Twi get smushed by ah full grand piano an&#039; walk away just fine.&quot; </p><p class="double">His guest sighed. </p><p class="double">&quot;I appreciate the thought, really I do, but I sincerely doubt a land full of colorful ponies can keep me safe from fate&#039;s caprices. It&#039;s just not going to happen.&quot; </p><p class="double">Macintosh smirked, extending a foreleg. </p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039; just haven&#039;t been properly introduced to what we can do here. In any case, we&#039;ll do our best. Now, what&#039;d you say yer name was again?&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion perked up just a tiny bit, moving to shake the proffered hoof. </p><p class="double">&quot;Well, my horsey memories tell me I&#039;m Buck Leaf, but you can call me Joe-&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh had heard something starting to creak at the word &quot;Buck&quot;, causing him to look up at the ceiling where the noise had come from. Directly above Joe&#039;s head there was a crack in a support beam he swore hadn&#039;t been there the last ten loops. He barely had time to think &quot;Fewmets&quot;. Before the stallion could finish introducing himself, Macintosh had flipped him over the ramshackle bar, and the ceiling strut had fallen, smashing the barstool and leaving a slump in the roof that was doubtless a huge depression in the room above. </p><p class="double">&quot;Applebloom, y&#039;all been experimentin&#039; with superheavy alloys in th&#039; kitchin agin&#039;? Y&#039;all know y&#039; ain&#039;t supposed to do that in the house!&quot; </p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s voice was just barely audible in the now dust-laden atmosphere of the cellar. </p><p class="double">Joe coughed. </p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe you should introduce me to that Twilight you spoke of.&quot; </p><p class="double">Macintosh stared at the once-sturdy structural piece of Sweet Apple Acres. </p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyup. An&#039; quick-like.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">53.6 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in the usual spot for a baseline loop: reading her book. If she hadn&#039;t glanced down, Twilight might even have been forgiven for thinking this loop was actually a baseline one.</p><p class="double">&#039;The Mysterious Missing Moon&#039;? That wasn&#039;t the name of the book...</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;None of thy light-loving ponies enjoyest my night? Well thou know what, forget thy ponies!&quot; Nightmare Moon declared, &quot;Verily, I shall make mine own ponies! With blackjack, and...and nightclubs!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i>And so the Queen of the Night departed to her celestial orb, and it vanished into the dark amongst the stars. But on the longest day of the thousandth year, it is said she will return to show off her new subjects, demanding that all acknowledge &#039;whose ponies are better now?!&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Twilight would have kept believing Luna was playing a prank, up to and including hiding the moon, until the Summer Sun Celebration. She watched Celestia awkwardly greet her long-lost sister and several &#039;moon ponies&#039; with a sense of bemusement: Twilight surely couldn&#039;t say she saw this coming at all.</p><p class="double">Of course, Twilight made sure to take lots of pictures of the moon ponies, and even more of their moon civilization once tourism between Equestria and the moon picked up: she knew the looping Luna would love to know what &#039;her&#039; subjects would be like. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">53.7 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Shimmery, but not showy. And the entire line is in the same adorable pattern! It works on everything from skirts to tops to shoes...&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled to herself as Suri went on her little schpiel. She&#039;d mastered this particular fabric countless loops ago, and had been honestly surprised when Twilight first brought it up. Still, she couldn&#039;t deny how alluring it looked to the eye, and after hearing what should have happened in this expansion period she held herself back and played her role... with a single difference.</p><p class="double">As soon as Suri finished her presentation, Rarity trotted backstage. &quot;My my <i>my</i> I had no idea you&#039;d use that fabric so <i>masterfully!</i> Your skills are surely beyond compare, Suri.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, weren&#039;t nothing for a designer like me.&quot; Suri smiled back. &quot;I&#039;m just glad you aren&#039;t angry for my little deception, mmkay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no, why would I be angry? If anything I&#039;m ecstatic!&quot; The white unicorn turned toward the dresses and examined them, keeping Suri and her assistent in the corner of her vision. &quot;I&#039;m just so happy that professional designers are using my <i>patented</i> fabric.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suri Polomore paled. &quot;...patented?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mmmhmm. Not only does it look good, but--ah, well, you probably already know, since you&#039;d have to pay royalties to use this. I couldn&#039;t imagine a pony so cruel as to pretend she invented this wonderful fabric, the law would be on them in <i>seconds.</i> Luckily we&#039;re old friends and, well, it&#039;s not like you&#039;re claiming you made the actual cloth is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.... well, about that--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She just loved the swatch you gave her,&quot; Coco offered quickly. &quot;You should have seen how fast she made the dresses!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity glanced at her in surprise. The assistant maintained an innocent smile.</p><p class="double">Suri blinked for a moment. &quot;...ah... um....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose I&#039;ll have to make a new line, though,&quot; Rarity said with a sigh. &quot;Hmm. Solidified fire is always a crowd-pleaser, don&#039;t you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I guess?&quot; Suri fidgeted on her hooves. &quot;I need to, uh, go check on something, mmkay?&quot; She galloped off quickly.</p><p class="double">Coco coughed. &quot;Um... what&#039;s the royalty cost for, uh, using this fabric? If I may ask--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, with all these dresses it rounds up to about three bits.&quot;</p><p class="double">The assistant blinked. &quot;Wait... that&#039;s it? Um, I mean, I don&#039;t know if the payment went through, so here.&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled out her own bitbag and started to go through it, only for Rarity to stop her with a hoof and a smile. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, dear, I won&#039;t press charges. But I think that whoever <i>really</i> designed these dresses should go solo. I have a friend in the theatre...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">53.8 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was early in the loop as Twilight pulled the Nightmare Moon legend tome off the shelf.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight! Twilight! I just had the bestest idea in ever!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, Pinkie Pie,&quot; Twilight said calmly, once her heart finished racing. She put the book back on the shelf; in the same space that was very recently occupied by her surprising pink pony friend, &quot;I&#039;m not going to ask you why you are here in Canterlot, and in a secure area of the royal library, this early in the loop. What&#039;s your idea?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Weeell, you know how every pony has been all sad and down these past couple of serious loops? I was thinking when I remembered how much fun the crusaders have been having by playing with boats? So I thought we could all do something like that. I checked and saw that most every pony was looping this time around. And it would be so perfect!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sat down on her favorite pillow and levitated a spare one for Pinkie, &quot;So you want us to build boats?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope. Let the little ones play with their sea boats. I want us to build ships. Space ships! It will be so much fun!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You want us to have space battles?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded enthusiastically with a large smile taking up most of her face, &quot;I figure we can take the same amount of time to build whatever class of ship we wanted. It would be two to a ship; a captain and a first mate. Then a massive free for all around the rings of that big old ring-y gas giant planet. It&#039;ll be a day full of explosions and space beams and missiles and fun!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That.. that actually does sound like fun. Once Nightmare Moon comes back, I&#039;ll let all the loopers know and see who wants to participate. I think Luna had something silly planned this time,&quot; Twilight stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Awesome sauce-ome!&quot; Pinkie happily hopped behind a bookcase. When she didn&#039;t come out from the other side, Twilight chanced a look. The pink pony was gone without a trace, as usual.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The dark mist dispersed and Nightmare Moon stood on stage, &quot;It is I, Nightmare Moon. What am I? I&#039;m an alicorn princess. Look at yourselves. You are not Nightmare Moon. Now what is that near your front hooves? It&#039;s moon rocks! Look back at me. I&#039;m now Princess Luna, Celestia&#039;s younger sister. Look at your moon rocks. They&#039;re full of candy! I&#039;m on a pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">And indeed she was suddenly sitting on the back of her sister. Princess Celestia rolled her eyes in amused exasperation, although a faint smile was starting to show through, &quot;Hello every pony. Please give a big round of applause for my little sister, back from her thousand year sabbatical.&quot;</p><p class="double">Loud stamping greeted Luna&#039;s performance and gift of free moon candy.</p><p class="double">After the sun was sent up by both alicorn sisters and the celebration wound down, the loopers were all told of Pinkie&#039;s spaceship battle party idea.</p><p class="double">&quot;So we have six months to make our ships from scratch. No fully formed ships from our subspace pockets if we have them. Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle have agreed to officiate. Any questions?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">No hooves were raised.</p><p class="double">Six months later, the teams were formed.</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s the last of the pre-flight checklist,&quot; said Nyx, Twilight&#039;s first mate, &quot;Our heavy cruiser is fully operational.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you discover anything new about the others&#039; ships, and how do you think our &#039;Lux Arcana&#039; stacks up to them, Nyx?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, our space ship has really strong shields. A good amount of missiles and point defense systems, an overpowered spinal cannon, and a rapid charge jump drive – since you like your teleport trick so much, Mom. This is pretty much you in starship form.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You helped build it, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;True, true. Well, apparently the others had the same design philosophy of trying to make a ship that resembled themselves. Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo made a light cruiser. I didn&#039;t peek at their specs, but I would guess that the &#039;Galaxy Runner&#039; is fast, fast, and fast. And with those two at the helm, it probably handles like a lithe frigate – maybe even a fighter. So speed and manoeuvrability as the primary defense,&quot; The main screen suddenly showed an image of a sleek ship that looked like it was going fast while standing still.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity and Spike made the heavy cruiser &#039;Grand Elegance&#039;. Other than being a work of art, it seems like it&#039;s a jack of all trades ship. Not weak against anything, but not fantastic in any particular area, either.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack and Big Mac grew their entry. The &#039;Apple Star&#039; is a dreadnaught-class tree ship.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx shuffled some data pads in front of her, &quot;Speaking of living ships, Fluttershy transformed Angel Bunny into a war leviathan – cabbit mix. We checked, but there is no rule against riding around inside your first mate who is now a cruiser-sized spaceship.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You think the transformation ability will stick through the loops?&quot; Twilight asked. Having a violence-prone rabbit with a Fluttershy protective streak that can change into a huge spaceship whenever he wants to would be.. interesting.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s adopted daughter gave her a flat look.</p><p class="double">&quot;So that&#039;s a yes. Fantastic,&quot; the purple unicorn deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Moving right along, Trixie and Chrysalis seemed to have made a destroyer. I&#039;m guessing that the &#039;Show Stopper&#039; has some impressive firepower, because Trixie. I would guess it also has some nice stealth cloak or illusions or accidental self destruct or something along those lines. Because Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Celestia and Luna have put together a cathedral-class battleship. The &#039;Solar Wind&#039; has immense armor on the front. That unicorn horn lance seems to indicate that ramming is indeed an option with that ship. Plus, I would not want to be caught in a broadside alpha-strike from that vessel.&quot;</p><p class="double">An image of a large pink ship appeared. Nyx continued, &quot;Aunt Cadence and Uncle Shining Armor made a carrier, the &#039;Crystal Sentinel&#039;. So tons of little flying heart-shaped fighters, I imagine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All the other awake loopers including Mayor Mare, er.. Ivory Scroll, Cheerilee, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon – or rather Silvertail Spoon, the deer; are sitting this one out and just helping commentate with Bloom and Sweetie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which leads us to the most worrisome contender,&quot; Nyx switched the image on the main screen to show what appeared to be the unholy lovechild between a flying saucer and a big top circus tent. Then, a tiny little speck appeared next to it. Squinting, Twilight astonishingly realized that it was a relative size comparison between that monstrosity and her own ship. Nyx continued, &quot;I have no idea how Pinkie Pie and Berry Punch made something that huge in the time we had, but there it is; the super-dreadnaught, &#039;Life of the Party&#039;. No idea what it&#039;s capabilities are. Pinkie could have stuffed it full of engines, or weapons, or balloons, or something.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably all of the above,&quot; Twilight sighed, &quot;Well as a certain pink pony would say, let&#039;s get this party on the road.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx nodded, &quot;Engaging jump drive in three, two, one...&quot;</p><p class="double">With a brief violet flash, the Lux Arcana vanished from orbit. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re gaining on us!&quot; Nyx shouted as she and Twilight sent their ship through a frantic variety of maneuvers. A sharp fly-by nearly scraped the paint off. One of the floating ice rocks passed far too closely. And there were many of them composing the ring around the large orange gas giant planet that dominated the view of the ongoing battle, &quot;This is your fault. &#039;Let&#039;s engage Rarity&#039;s ship,&#039; you said. &#039;It&#039;ll be easy,&#039; you said.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not the time, Nyx. And how was I supposed to know her ship was practically invulnerable to everything we threw at it?&quot; Twilight pressed a few buttons in near panic, &quot;Stand by for emergency jump in three, two, one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Just as it was about to hit a smallish-sized ice moon, the &#039;Lux Arcana&#039; vanished and reappeared beyond the rock while still travelling at full acceleration. Rarity&#039;s and Spike&#039;s &#039;Grand Elegance&#039; simply plowed through the moon, shattering it completely.</p><p class="double">Beams lashed out from the tastefully designed warship and impacted on Twilight&#039;s shields, bringing them down slightly and shaking the two ponies inside the vessel.</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re still coming. That didn&#039;t even slow it down much,&quot; Nyx looked down at her console, &quot;Incoming communication from the &#039;Grand Elegance&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Open channel,&quot; Twilight said while continuing evasive manoeuvres.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi Twilight,&quot; Spike waved from his chair, &quot;No hard feelings, I hope?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;None whatsoever, Spike. You&#039;re still my number one little dragon brother, but it&#039;s not over yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not until the fat pony has the heart-song,&quot; Nyx realized Twilight, Spike, and Rarity were all staring at her, &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Never mind. Close channel,&quot; Twilight shook her head and concentrated, &quot;There, let&#039;s head towards that moon. It&#039;s big enough to hide in.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Course changed,&quot; Nyx looked up at her adopted mother, &quot;Um, do you think that moon kind of.. sort of.. looks like an apple?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes shrunk to pin pricks, &quot;That&#039;s no moon. Release missiles. Stagger fire! Head back into the dense part of the rings!&quot;</p><p class="double">The apple-shaped moon unfolded like a flower and released a very large wooden tree ship.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yee-haw!&quot; Came the sound of Applejack&#039;s voice over the comm, &quot;Hope you all weren&#039;t hoping to stage this space rodeo without us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeyep,&quot; Big Macintosh agreed with his sister.</p><p class="double">Twilight strafed her ship just in time to avoid a massive beam that originated from Applejack&#039;s tree-ship. Said beam instead impacted the chasing &#039;Grand Elegance&#039;, doing absolutely no damage to it.</p><p class="double">Two of the missiles from the Arcana&#039;s barrage made it past the living ship&#039;s point defenses and detonated. Each massive explosion seared away numerous structural support branches. Then, to every non-Apple family pony&#039;s amazement, the missing branches regenerated right back before their eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh come on! Am I the only one with a ship that&#039;s not invulnerable?&quot; the lavender unicorn shook her hoof at the ceiling.</p><p class="double">&quot;Incoming communication from Cadance!&quot; Nyx announced.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there, Twi!&quot; Cadance spoke up from her chair, &quot;Looks like you need a little help. Just hold direction and acceleration vector and we&#039;ll be right there to help.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks, Cadence,&quot; Twilight aimed her ship towards the &#039;Crystal Sentinel&#039; and charged her main weapon.</p><p class="double">&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Nyx questioned through clenched teeth, &quot;We have Rarity and Applejack bearing down on us. We need help!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight kept smiling at her sister-in-law on the screen, &quot;One more thing. If you&#039;re in a carrier, where are your fighters? But just for old time&#039;s sake, let&#039;s finish the rest of the song. Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake...&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Cadence&#039; stopped smiling and shut off her view screen. Twilight&#039;s main cannon fired a staggering beam that lanced out and hit the ship supposedly coming to her rescue. The &#039;Crystal Sentinel&#039;s&#039; image wavered before reforming into the much smaller, and now damaged, &#039;Show Stopper&#039;. More worrisome was the wayward stealth torpedo that was detonated by chance as the beam glanced it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Emergency Jump in three, two, one!&quot; Twilight frantically slammed her hoof on the button. The &#039;Lux Arcana&#039; vanished right before several stealth torpedoes passed through the empty space where it had occupied mere moments before.</p><p class="double">Seeing their primary target vanish, the torpedoes locked on to the nearest enemy signals. Several impacted the &#039;Grand Elegance&#039; without too much noticeable outward effect, although something must have shaken loose as the cruiser&#039;s engines stopped accelerating and the ship continued to drift. The ones that managed to get through the &#039;Apple Star&#039;s&#039; point defenses made far bigger explosions than Twilight&#039;s missiles. A full third of the huge tree-ship&#039;s superstructure started to come apart, only to be snatched by grasping roots and pulled back in to re-merge with the main body.</p><p class="double">Trixie and Chrysalis had almost fixed their engines and illusionary cloak when their ship was suddenly hit by many rapidly fired beams and exploded in a grandiose fireball. &quot;Former boaster has been busted!&quot; Scootaloo cheered on the comm.</p><p class="double">The &#039;Galaxy Runner&#039; raced out of the fading explosion and did a purposeless barrel roll just for show. Rainbow Dash chimed in herself, &quot;Hope we&#039;re not late for this little engagement.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not at all, dear. In fact, why don&#039;t you have some fabulous door prizes,&quot; Rarity spoke up as she launched a dozen long range missiles at Dash&#039;s ship.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now if that don&#039;t sound like a good idea. You can go ahead and have some of mine as well,&quot; Applejack launched far more of her own missiles. Most went towards the &#039;Galaxy Runner&#039;, but bolstered by the effect Trixie&#039;s super torpedoes had; some went towards Rarity as well.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s what I&#039;m talking about!&quot; Rainbow cheered as the missiles closed in, &quot;What&#039;s stunt flying without a few obstacles? Scootaloo, you got this?&quot;</p><p class="double">While Rainbow&#039;s special talent was speed, Scootaloo was all about evasion. The orange filly spoke up happily, &quot;No problem. I got this.&quot;</p><p class="double">The &#039;Galaxy Runner&#039; swerved up and towards the missile swarm, and then started making increasingly spectacular maneuvers. The ship seemed to be almost playing a friendly game of tag with the deadly projectiles, occasionally causing two or more to crash into each other or into the resulting explosion. Its point defenses firing only to put hopelessly outclassed missiles out of their misery.</p><p class="double">Rarity&#039;s ship didn&#039;t fare as well. None of the explosions appeared to damage it outwardly, but neither did it stop drifting. It didn&#039;t help when a spiked teardrop shape appeared over the crest of one moon and fired a large red beam at the &#039;Grand Elegance&#039;s&#039; engines – turning them into inoperable slag.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I hope you don&#039;t mind too much, Rarity,&quot; Fluttershy said over the comm, &quot;But injured prey is easy prey. No offense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No offense taken, Fluttershy, dear,&quot; there were small fires all through Rarity&#039;s bridge which Spike was attempting to extinguish, &quot;I suppose we&#039;ll just have a closer look at this delightful planet.&quot;</p><p class="double">Caught in its gravity well, the elegant ship continued to float towards the gas giant until it vanished into the gaseous depths.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, the &#039;Lux Arcana&#039; reappeared right behind Fluttershy&#039;s ship and fired its main spinal cannon. Unfortunately for Twilight, Angel Bunny&#039;s reflexes were faster and the large beam was evaded – if only barely.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you okay, Angel Bunny?&quot; Fluttershy asked. The floating crystal with Angel&#039;s face on it said something too softly for Twilight to make out. The librarian, however, did recognize the look that appeared on the yellow pegasus&#039; face – as apparently so did Nyx. The little alicorn filly slammed a button and quickly shut down the view screen before she and her adopted mother could take the brunt of Fluttershy&#039;s stare.</p><p class="double">Twilight took a brief glance at the tactical display as Nyx started chasing after Angel Bunny. The battle had moved away from the bulk of the rings. Most of the moons and other large obstacles were far from the action.</p><p class="double">Applejack and Rainbow Dash were engaged in continuing their life-long friendly rivalry in space. The &#039;Galaxy Runner&#039; was weaving in and out of the &#039;Apple Star&#039;s&#039; structural branches, shooting any target of opportunity – which tended to just regenerate and grow right back into place.</p><p class="double">There was a flash of light as the real &#039;Crystal Sentinel&#039; appeared nearby. The carrier had seen better times, since its shields seemed severely weakened and parts of it were either missing or on fire. Dozens of drones provided a rapidly diminishing fighter screen from the source of their mother-ship&#039;s devastation. The slightly worse for wear battleship, the &#039;Solar Wind&#039;, was persistently dogging the carrier&#039;s heels. The ship&#039;s vast array of turrets were proving devastating against the fighters as they were set to emit faster firing but lower yield beams.</p><p class="double">One of the battleship&#039;s missiles must have scored a lucky hit as the &#039;Crystal Sentinel&#039; started to slow. A few moments later, the &#039;Solar Wind&#039; impacted the carrier like a cosmic freight train. The enhanced shields held for a split second under the mass of the heavier ship before blinking out. The cathedral-like battleship passed inexorably through the burning shattered remains of the Sentinel, trailing streamers of burning fuel and atmosphere.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good afternoon, Twilight,&quot; Celestia appeared on the view screen, &quot;I&#039;m sorry your foal-sitter and brother blew up, but I do admit that this was a grand idea.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Very therapeutic,&quot; agreed Luna.</p><p class="double">Before Twilight could answer, the screen filled with static for a brief moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked Nyx.</p><p class="double">The little pony was busy examining her console, &quot;Apparently Rarity&#039;s and Spike&#039;s ship finally succumbed to the pressure of the planet&#039;s atmosphere. The &#039;Grand Elegance&#039;s&#039; explosion sent a massive EMP burst and oh-oh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? What?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think the explosion woke something up. There&#039;s a huge shape quickly rising up from the planet&#039;s depths. Something massive,&quot; Nyx answered worryingly.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at a growing patch in the gas giant&#039;s atmosphere. Then like an enormous leviathan rising from the ocean surface, the circular hubcap-like form of the &#039;Life of the Party&#039; broke through the cloud layer.</p><p class="double">The star-base sized ship accelerated rapidly and interposed itself in Angel Bunny&#039;s path, flipping over to present the largest possible surface area to the panicking craft. The bunny-turned spaceship tried his best to evade, but ended up slamming into the dreadnaught like a gong. The living ship exploded, leaving a relatively small smoking crater.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy and Angel – in normal rabbit form – appeared at a booth inside of Mac&#039;s bar, along with the faint smell of burning smoke. The yellow pegasus immediately nuzzled her friend and companion, &quot;Don&#039;t feel bad, Angel Bunny. You did your best.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good Angel and brave Fluttershy. Your efforts, I would not deny,&quot; the zebra trotted over to their table with a cart full of drinks and snacks.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re working here now, Zecora?&quot;</p><p class="double">The zebra nodded, &quot;With ponies in space, the position was free. I asked Macintosh why it couldn&#039;t be me. Don&#039;t feel too down you didn&#039;t finish the match. Watch with your friends and drink this morning&#039;s fresh batch,&quot; Zecora placed two glasses and a pitcher of carrot juice on the tabletop. Fluttershy thanked her kindly and looked over at the other tables.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity, Spike, Trixie, Chrysalis, Cadence, and Shining Armor; along with all the other non participating loopers, were watching the large screens that showed the current state of the battle. Apple Bloom and Sweetie Bell were commenting on how Rainbow Dash must have gotten bored doing negligible damage to the Apples&#039; tree ship and decided to take on Twilight. Only for Pinkie&#039;s vessel to suddenly micro-jump in Dash&#039;s path.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo screamed as their view was suddenly filled with pastel colored dreadnaught. However, years of stunt flying had left both with lightning fast reflexes. The &#039;Galaxy Runner&#039; pulled up, barely managing to adjust its course in time. It came withing a few meters of scraping itself to shreds on the larger ship.</p><p class="double">The sleek cruiser shot forward until it cleared the outer edge of the &#039;Life of the Party&#039;, only to run into a full broadside barrage by the &#039;Solar Wind&#039;. Scootaloo did her best, managing to evade many of the beams; but there were too many energy blasts boxing them in. The speedy ship&#039;s shields failed and it came apart in a shower of flaming debris.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huzzah!&quot; exclaimed Luna over the general comm channel, &quot;And you thought all those hours spent playing video games were wasted, sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not now, little Lulu. Something is happening on Pinkie&#039;s... are we on general chat?&quot; Celestia&#039;s embarrassed image suddenly switched off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Energy spike from Pinkie&#039;s ship!&quot; Nyx suddenly shouted as she tried to plot an evasive course.</p><p class="double">&quot;Head towards the &#039;Solar Wind&#039;&quot; Twilight said, adding, &quot;I have a plan.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your plan had better be more than &#039;let&#039;s fly into the guns of a battleship&#039;, mom.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is. I just have to get the timing right,&quot; Twilight noticed how the filly was looking at her, &quot;There&#039;s not much else we can do. Or do you think we can evade whatever central weapon that&#039;s housed in that giant pie-shaped thing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx looked back at her console, &quot;Heading directly for the princesses&#039; cannons. Hope this works.&quot;</p><p class="double">Indeed, the &#039;Solar Wind&#039; saw a new target and turned to aim most of its turrets at the &#039;Lux Arcana&#039;.</p><p class="double">Twilight shunted all the weapon power to the jump drive capacitor, reducing the time needed to only half a second.</p><p class="double">&quot;Steady, steady,&quot; the unicorn spoke to herself. The battleship finished turning to face her. It was rapidly filling up her screen as she approached.</p><p class="double">&quot;Almost, almost,&quot; Pinkie&#039;s and Berry&#039;s starship had reddish energy playing over its surface like lightning, coalescing into a bright mass in the center.</p><p class="double">&quot;Emergency jump now!&quot; Twilight slammed her console and her ship vanished in a burst of light.</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s immense energy blast shot forward in a zig-zagging lightning-like path, either absorbing or ignoring any of the battleship&#039;s turret bolts it encountered. It passed through the space where Twilight&#039;s ship used to be and impacted the &#039;Solar Wind&#039;. Red sparks and immense energies played over the battleship&#039;s shields, occasionally reaching down and striking the hull.</p><p class="double">A few seconds later, the &#039;Solar Wind&#039; was still there, entirely undamaged.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sensors indicate no damage whatsoever,&quot; Nyx double checked her results, &quot;Communication request from the &#039;Life of the Party&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">A grinning Pinkie Pie appeared on the view screen. Berry Punch was behind her, gazing at a console while sipping something from a crazy straw stuck in a huge glass. Several empty such glasses littered the floor around her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi, Twilight! Are you having fun?&quot; Pinkie asked, &quot;Do you like my ship? Do you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s very nice, Pinkie,&quot; Twilight answered, &quot;By the way, what was that energy blast supposed to do?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled, &quot;It&#039;s a surprise. Just watch.&quot;</p><p class="double">The screen blinked off. Nyx looked at her tactical display, &quot;The &#039;Solar Wind&#039; is accelerating at Pinkie&#039;s ship. It&#039;s going to try to ram it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. She shunted power back into weapons. It looked like there was going to be at least one fewer ship soon, and she wanted to be prepared.</p><p class="double">The battleship kept speeding up until it was almost at the much larger vessel. To Nyx, it looked like a dart approaching a dartboard.</p><p class="double">Then Pinkie&#039;s ship jumped, revealing the repaired and tentatively nearing &#039;Apple Star&#039; to be right in the path of the alicorn sisters&#039; ship.</p><p class="double">&quot;They&#039;re not stopping or changing direction,&quot; Twilight stated, &quot;What did Pinkie Pie do?&quot;</p><p class="double">The two ponies watched as the battleship collided with the larger tree ship dreadnaught. It smashed its way through the outer branches, slowing down until it finally came to rest near the core. There was a moment of stunned silence.</p><p class="double">Then the &#039;Solar Wind&#039; self destructed, the titanic explosion destroying the &#039;Apple Star&#039; along with it.</p><p class="double">Nyx finally broke the silence, &quot;Er, mom? Didn&#039;t one of Pinkie&#039;s recent loops have her as Radical Pinkie, hacker extraordinaire? I think, I think she just brute forced her way into the &#039;Solar Wind&#039;s&#039; computer systems. That blast was an AI in the form of an energy being. Not a very smart one, maybe parasprite level intelligence; but that is all you really need. Since it is an energy being, shields won&#039;t work against it. It&#039;s like trying to keep a pony out of your house when your door is made of salad. We can&#039;t ever let ourselves get hit by that thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Agreed,&quot; Twilight Sparkle nodded, &quot;Set a course for the &#039;Life of the Party&#039;. We need to do enough damage to that subverter ray before it fires again. There doesn&#039;t appear to be too many point defenses on that thing. If only Cadance and Shiney were still around with their carrier.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx shrugged as the &#039;Lux Arcana&#039; spun around and changed course.</p><p class="double">Apparently, Pinkie&#039;s ship wasn&#039;t out of surprises. Panels opened throughout the ship and let loose hundreds of multicolored balloon-like orbs.</p><p class="double">&quot;What are those?&quot; Nyx tried to process what she was seeing.</p><p class="double">Twilight realized what they were as her eyes widened, &quot;Mines.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, if that ship has mines; does that also mean it has..&quot; Nyx was preempted by a beeping noise. More panels opened up on the large ship and disgorged a seemingly endless stream of missiles. Another beeping noise, &quot;Energy spike from Pinkie&#039;s ship. She&#039;s going to try to use the subverter again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s fine, maintain course,&quot; Twilight announced. She was glued to her tactical screen as the missiles kept getting closer and closer. Then with a start, she spoke up, &quot;Emergency jump in three, two, one, now!&quot;</p><p class="double">The &#039;Lux Arcana&#039; blinked away from the incoming missiles and appeared on the other side of the Pinkie&#039;s ship. The &#039;Life of the Party&#039; micro-jumped to face the other way. Just in time for Twilight to slam a button down and fire her main cannon.</p><p class="double">The overcharged blast raced across the vacuum and slammed into the &#039;Life of the Party&#039;s&#039; main cannon, right as it had gathered full capacitance. Right when Pinkie had briefly lowered her shields so that she could fire out.</p><p class="double">The massive energies warred with each other before detonating in a titanic blast that shredded the massive dreadnaught and sent Twilight&#039;s ship tumbling.</p><p class="double">Nyx lifted herself off the floor and looked at her display, &quot;We did it! We did it! We..&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a beeping noise. Nyx stopped cheering suddenly.</p><p class="double">&quot;What was... &quot; Twilight asked before looking at the view screen – as all of the thousands of Pinkie&#039;s missiles that survived their ship&#039;s destruction streaked through the dissipating fireball and converged on the battered &#039;Lux Arcana&#039;.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Twilight managed to say before suddenly finding herself and Nyx in Mac&#039;s bar. There was loud cheering and applause.</p><p class="double">&quot;Congratulations, you two! You managed to last the longest, so here is your prize,&quot; Discord slinked up to the two disoriented ponies and gave them each a big apple. On each of the fruits, there was written in edible ink, &quot;Best Space Pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">The lavender unicorn looked up at Discord questioningly.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s traditional,&quot; he smugly said.</p><p class="double">Twilight just shrugged, smiled, and stuffed the entire apple in her mouth. It tasted sweet, like victory. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">53.9 (Goldude)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Now, Ahuizotl...&quot; Daring Do slid the giant ring over her head onto her neck. &quot;You know I love you, but I can&#039;t give you the ring until I&#039;ve properly proposed.&quot;</p><p class="double">A nearby tree squeed. Rainbow Dash, Ahuizotl, and Daring Do turned their heads over to said tree with confused and questioning faces.</p><p class="double">A wild Awake Cadance popped out of the tree and enthusiastically skipped her way over to the fighting duo. Rainbow Dash double-taked. &quot;The hay? Cadance, have you been following us?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have. And it&#039;s a good thing! I very nearly missed a proposal! Go ahead. I&#039;ll wait.&quot;</p><p class="double">Some awkward silence ensued. Ahuizotl cleared his throat. &quot;We&#039;re in the middle of some business, insignificant-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I know! I&#039;m just waiting until Daring Do proposes. Then you two can get married! Let me plan your wedding.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was left to hysterics while Ahuizotl facepalmed and Daring Do stared incredulously at the strange alicorn.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A Nonawake Fluttershy had successfully led Changeling versions of herself astray. She turned around only to be faced with four Rainbow Dashes. She winced and backed away as they were all about to converge on her. Suddenly, the Awoken Rainbow Dash grinned and quickly took care of the Changeling fakes. It was a good thing for Rainbow Dash that Chrysalis was not Awake. She and Twilight were the only ones this loop. Rainbow pleaded with Twilight to let this loop go Baseline until they get to the part where the Changelings were guarding The Elements of Harmony.</p><p class="double">She considered it a personal challenge to be able to defeat The Changelings and reach The Elements, is the main reason she wanted this. It would show her just how much stronger the two of them had actually gotten.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash offered a hoof the a cowering Fluttershy laying on the floor. It was accepted, and the blue pegasus helpfully pulled her Cloudsdale friend up, their lips very nearly coming into contact.</p><p class="double">There was an explosion in the distance. Nobody really paid attention to it.</p><p class="double">That was a bad idea.</p><p class="double">Cadance was Awake and was plowing through the Changelings, making her way over to Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Aww, I missed it. You two would&#039;ve been great together.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was boggled. &quot;...Are you serious, Cadance!? Now!?&quot; She and Fluttershy were then tackled by ten changelings.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The crowd in Apploosa was gathered around the stage. Murmurs were scattered across from person to person. They were quickly cut shory as an Awake Spike played the first few notes in the piano. A nonawake Pinkie excitedly poked her head out from behind the curtain, eager to start her song. Things were previously discussed amongst Spike, Rarity, and Twilight about the nature of the song Pinkie Pie would sing.</p><p class="double">The Awakened quartet had been made sure to bake enough pies for this plan to work. The curtains were pulled open and the clam Pinkie was in opened, revealing the very same outfit Pinkie wore each and every time she sung at this point in the loop. It&#039;s a mystery why she always ended up in that outfit at one point or another in Apploosa.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie then began to sing.</p><p class="double">♪Some of you may be tired♪</p><p>♪And many may moan and beg♪</p><p class="double">As the first lines were being sung, Rainbow Dash&#039;s wings were extended. Suddenly, a pink light erupted from the stage with a loud TWOOM. When the light subsided, an Awake Cadance immediately took off and glomped Rainbow Dash, elliciting a surprised yelp.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Rainbow Dash! I didn&#039;t know you felt that way towards Pinkie Pie! I can&#039;t wait for your wedding!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, what?&quot; was the only response Dash could make.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle crashed open the door. Cadance whipped her head towards one of Twilight Sparkle&#039;s Great Disapproval glowers. The Crystal Pony princess was frozen in action, a piece of chalk hanging in the air with a magical glow around it.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle slowly turned her head towards the wall. On it were a series of pictures of various pairs of ponies with hearts between them.</p><p class="double">&quot;...This needs to stop. Intervention time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Buts lead to Eiken.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance flinched. Twilight Sparkle wasn&#039;t going to take any of this. </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Years of living amongst the nobility helped him keep his ecstasy from overwhelming the ponies around him, but he couldn&#039;t help a small smirk as he leaned into his wife.

After years, he had finally been recognized for his own genius and now he and his wife would <i>what the hay was the princess </i><u><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;All I know is pain,&quot; Celestia droned from behind her thick black bangs. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;...and with her own humble talents, not only did this pony soundly defeat Discord...&quot; Celestia paused. &quot;Well... inebriate him, anyway...&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a smattering of laughter in the crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;...but also! This pony mastered her own magic on a deep and powerful level, earning herself a place equal to me and my sister. Fillies and Gentlecolts.... may I present Princess Berry Punch!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheers resounded throughout the hall as the mare emerged, waving at the gathered ponies. She leaned towards her companion for a second. &quot;This still counts for the competition, right? I didn&#039;t mean to ascend, after all, this is my first time with wings...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I&#039;m marking this as a win.&quot; Twilight smiled. &quot;You do realize this means you can&#039;t be in that club anymore.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YAY MOM!&quot; shouted a filly at the front of the crowd as she jumped onto the stage and hugged her leg. &quot;YOU ROCK!&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry smiled. &quot;...I think I can live with that.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Masterweaver):</p><p class="double"><u><i>what the hay was the princess </i><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;Ahyck!&quot; Celestia honked her red rubber nose. &quot;Hiya kids!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Masterweaver):</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><u><i>what the hay was the princess </i><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;GREETINGS ORGANIC LIFE FORMS,&quot; droned the armored figure. &quot;I AM DEFINITELY YOUR LEADER AND I AM POSITIVE TO SEE YOU.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.3 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s first few minutes after Awakening were a bit of a blur, thanks to the pounding headache.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d just had her locket stolen- the locket which was the only thing she had to remember her uncle by. She vaguely recalled ranting dire imprecations of doom for the two thieves before the headache sent her to her knees. Then, before she&#039;d had time to recover from that, she heard the bells of the town clock ring. She was late to work at the university, and the sheer horror of being late for anything- and even worse, late for work at an institute of higher learning- made her so frantic that she didn&#039;t stop to take stock of her situation until after Mister Tock had challenged her at the university gates.</p><p class="double">Once the giant clank had allowed her to proceed, Twilight scrambled for Professor Beetle&#039;s personal lab, where she was the junior lab assistant. She reached for the doorknob, recognizing for the first time the four fingers and a thumb on the end of her arm. It had taken her a good ten minutes to realize she was human.</p><p class="double">Specifically, she was a human named Twilight Clay. Her adoptive father Adam, a mute giant of a man, operated a blacksmithy, while her mother Lilith taught piano and music lessons. Professor Beetle had been her personal mentor for over a decade, ever since her uncle had vanished. She would have been thrown out of the college for lack of aptitude dozens of times except for his personal intervention... but, since Beetle was the man who ruled not only Transylvania Polygnostic University but the entire city of Beetleburg as well, nobody questioned his decisions too loudly.</p><p class="double">Beetle had the Spark- the peculiar form of insanity that could impose itself on the laws of physics, twisting them, outright breaking them on occasion- but breaking them in ways which could be studied and repeated by the non-gifted. Sparks ruled most of Europa, and had done for centuries... which explained why much of the continent was a wasteland inhabited only by bandits, monsters, bandit monsters, and the occasional terrified peasant.</p><p class="double">The Long War, it had been called- centuries of hereditary nobility and/or mad scientists fighting for dominion, for abstract ideals, or for the last slice of strawberry shortcake. All of which had finally, finally been brought to a stop when Baron Wulfenshy had knocked enough heads together to enforce his Pax Europa. Now, almost twenty years later, the continent grumbled in sullen resentment under his dictatorial rule... but, Twilight mused, even the current temporary armistice was an improvement over what had come before.</p><p class="double">Out of what had come before there had been only a handful of true heroes, the most notable of which were the legendary Sparkle Boys. Heirs of a long line of truly evil and decadent bandit lords, they had gone against the family traditions and become true, noble heroes. Even after their disappearance stories and plays about their exploits, mostly fiction of course, rang across all-</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s reverie came to a screeching halt. The Sparkle boys? Could it be a coincidence?</p><p class="double">Of course not. The Loops don&#039;t do coincidences. Besides, the Lost Heir was one of the oldest tropes in the book.</p><p class="double">Twilight Clay, aka Twilight Sparkle, grinned at the thought. Already she could feel things fizzing in the back of her brain as her headache cleared. Knowledge gleaned from uncountable Loops synergized with the information gathered from a broad post-secondary education in one of Europa&#039;s finest institutions for budding mad scientists. She could visualize exactly what had gone wrong with her previous clank. She could even see where she&#039;d erred in making the clank in her pocket, the one she&#039;d brought to show Professor Beetle today. She could imagine fifteen different improvements for Mister Tock, including a modular transformation that would allow for the giant mecha to divide into five human-piloted war machines.</p><p class="double">With an effort Twilight forced her lips to close over her grin. I mustn&#039;t reveal myself too soon or too swiftly, she thought. A new Spark is a threat to the status quo. And if people knew the Sparkle Boys had an heir! Oh, the chaos and destruction and adventure that would result! No, better to wait until she was prepared...</p><p class="double">... and then she&#039;d show them.</p><p class="double">And then she&#039;d show them ALL!</p><p class="double">With a supreme effort of will Twilight turned the maniacal laughter into a coughing fit. She composed her features into sadness and despair- the locket, remember the mugging and oh yes I will make them <i>calm calm calm</i>- and put her hand on the door. Despite her best efforts, she couldn&#039;t stifle the exaltation within her at the prospect of a lab, a new day, and a new world of infinite possibilities.</p><p class="double">Today would be a great day... for SCIENCE. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Goldude)</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><u><i>what the hay was the princess </i><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;I got this costume of myself from Pinkie Pie!&quot; came a voice from a shoddily constructed hole in the Princess Celestia costume. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Jcogginsa)</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><u><i>what the hay was the princess </i><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;What?

Twilight had thought this Loop a silly, lighthearted mad-science world... or, possibly, she just hadn&#039;t cared while her brain was percolating with all those ideas. But Professor Beetle... well, as the events of the previous five minutes had demonstrated, he wasn&#039;t a <i>good</i> man as such, but he was one of the better ones this world had to offer. Even if he had tried to kill the young daughter of the overlord who&#039;d just taken his city away from him, he didn&#039;t deserve death. He didn&#039;t deserve THAT death.</p><p class="double">But when he&#039;d thrown that auto-guiding aerial hand grenade at the Baron and his daughter, Twilight hadn&#039;t hesitated.</p><p class="double">&quot;How&#039;s his head?&quot; the Baron asked one of the professor&#039;s former lab assistants, Mr. Glassvitch.</p><p class="double">Glassvitch didn&#039;t need more than a moment to look through the remains. &quot;Totally destroyed, Herr Baron.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So he&#039;s dead,&quot; the quiet voice of the baron&#039;s daughter murmured.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Permanently. A pity, that.&quot; The baron&#039;s voice was not so much weighed down with sorrow as toting a convenience-store bag of mild regret.</p><p class="double">&quot;A pity?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;He threw a BOMB at your DAUGHTER!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A poor excuse,&quot; the quiet voice of the baron&#039;s daughter said accusingly.</p><p class="double">&quot;A poor excuse?!&quot; Twilight could feel that mental percolation in the back of her mind again. &quot;HE THREW A BOMB AT YOU!&quot;</p><p class="double">The jagermonster in charge of the Baron&#039;s bodyguard detail pulled an intact organ out of the smouldering mess of the Professor&#039;s remains. &quot;Hey, I von&#039;t zay he vos SCHTUPID, but I ain&#039;t findin&#039; a whole lotta brains in dis!&quot;</p><p class="double">The baron&#039;s assistant sighed. &quot;Baron, may we leave now? My feet are sticking to the floor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HOW DARE YOU!&quot; Twilight&#039;s glare swept across all the members of the Baron&#039;s entourage. &quot;Because of your petty Spark power politics you just made me kill my TEACHER! And you&#039;re treating his murder like some sort of... of... of KITCHEN accident! Professor Beetle was a good man! The people of this city LOVED him! And when they find out what&#039;s happened here, they&#039;re going to-&quot;</p><p class="double">The percolation built and built in Twilight&#039;s mind, and then without warning it turned into a mental explosion of glass, shards ripping through her consciousness. She screamed and fell to her knees, holding her head in her hands, unable to focus.</p><p class="double">When the attack subsided enough for her to understand words again, Twilight heard the Baron speaking. &quot;Sergeant, walk the young lady home.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually,&quot; the baron&#039;s daughter murmured, &quot;I&#039;d prefer to do it myself. If you don&#039;t mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gilly, are you absolutely sure?&quot; the Baron asked. &quot;Rumors must already be flying around the city-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Father, you&#039;ve had me trained,&quot; Gilly Wulfenshy replied. &quot;And if I can survive morning exercises with Bang, I&#039;m certain I can survive a city under martial law.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pah,&quot; the jagermonster muttered. &quot;Little Flutters? Protect herself? Schpent all dot time in Paris communing mit nature und dancink mit der fluffy critterz, iz vot I hear. Vot kind of trainink is-&quot;</p><p class="double">The hand that grabbed the jagermonster&#039;s wrist was small and delicate, but not gentle. Nor was the foot that swept the jager&#039;s legs out from under, the knees which found each kidney in rapid succession, and the arms which swept the sergeant in a perfect semicircle overhead to slam back down- hard- into the stone floor.</p><p class="double">&quot;... hokay, pretty goot trainin&#039;,&quot; the jager gasped, a tone of respect now in his growl.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well,&quot; the Baron said. &quot;But hurry straight back. We must put together a plan for the administration of the city, now that Beetle is gone.&quot;</p><p class="double">Once they were out of the gates of the university and out of earshot of the Wulfenbach guard clanks, the young Wulfenshy said, &quot;Thank you for saving my life, Twilight. But I could have taken care of it myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;But when it comes to a split-second decision, I&#039;ll always defend my friends. Even friends I&#039;ve just barely met.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you been in this Loop before? I haven&#039;t seen it, but you&#039;ve been doing this longer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is a new one for me, too.&quot; Twilight looked around her at buildings not much different than Ponyville&#039;s, though with narrower streets, paved with cobblestones. &quot;And it&#039;s not turning out to be a very nice one so far.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It has its moments,&quot; Fluttershy said, &quot;but it plays for keeps. You were about to go into a full Spark rant, weren&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t remind me,&quot; Twilight replied. Her head still hurt a little.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t ever do that around my father. Here I&#039;m Gillian Wulfenshy, sole heir to the dictator who rules more than a third of Europa directly and keeps the rest too scared to do anything about it. I Awoke this morning in the middle of morning exercises with a sky pirate captain who thinks a day&#039;s wasted without at least one fresh corpse. And she&#039;s on MY side. There&#039;s worse than her around.&quot;</p><p class="double">They stood in front of Clay Mechanical, Twilight&#039;s home. &quot;Keep your Spark hidden as long as you can, Twilight,&quot; she said. &quot;Because when people find out you have it, they&#039;re going to come for you. And you haven&#039;t got a powerful warlord this Loop to protect you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll be careful,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;You stay safe too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about me. You&#039;re not the only one the Spark has touched in this Loop. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll be meeting again.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Wing Zero 032)</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><u><i>what the hay was the princess </i><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">The peels slowly slid off Celestia as she gave him a maniac&#039;s smile. &quot;Do you like...

They didn&#039;t want to stay around with the Baron in the city... more to the point, they didn&#039;t want Twilight to stay around. She had been supposed to pack her things, but she&#039;d felt so exhausted...</p><p class="double">&quot;I SAID WAKE UP!&quot;</p><p class="double">Something yanked hard on Twilight&#039;s hair.</p><p class="double">There was a wrench in her hand. She used it.</p><p class="double">&quot;WHOA! Twilight, it&#039;s me! It&#039;s Spike!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight finally opened her eyes, slipping her glasses back over her eyes for a clear view. Standing in the middle of the garage was a wild-eyed youngish man. Except for the light green hair and unkempt beard, there was nothing that could set the man before her apart from thousands of other ex-military, mercenary or pirate crewmen- the old, slightly ratty uniform, the wild-eyed look, the whole package.</p><p class="double">Then memory waved a file card at her. This was one of the men who had mugged her.</p><p class="double">&quot;How do you know that name?&quot; she snarled, yanking her wrist out of the man&#039;s grip and brandishing the wrench for a second go.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ponyville!&quot; he gasped, stepping back out of reach. &quot;Library! Number one assistant! Loops and things!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight slowly got to her feet, forcing herself to relax a bit. &quot;Sorry about that, Spike,&quot; she said. &quot;Mind explaining what you were doing mugging me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry about that. I Awoke in the middle of that. My in-loop brother Omar was the one who took your locket.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Where is he now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dead.&quot; Spike shook his head. &quot;I know it&#039;s the Loop memories talking, but Omar was still family. We only had each other since the mech got... well... anyway, we only had each other. And he shouldn&#039;t have taken your locket, but he didn&#039;t deserve to die for it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Die? But that was just this morning. And Professor Beetle&#039;s dead, so how could he have had time to hold a court?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m guessing the locket killed him,&quot; Spike said. &quot;He clutched it as he was dying, didn&#039;t let go until the end. I was so mad I threw it to the floor, and it shattered.&quot; He reached into a pocket and pulled out one piece. &quot;That&#039;s when I noticed the name and address engraved on the back and put two and two together.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight liked this Loop less and less by the minute. &quot;I&#039;m sorry about Omar,&quot; she said. &quot;But I&#039;m glad we&#039;re together... what&#039;s your name here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike von Zinzer,&quot; he said. &quot;Former mechanic on- what&#039;s that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rapid thumping noise shook the ground as something very, very heavy ran towards the forge. Stooping through the open garage door came a steam locomotive on legs. It brought itself to a stop less than a foot in front of Spike and grabbed him in a metal claw. Almost instantly Spike pulled a lightsaber out of his subspace pocket and pruned the clank of its arm, but the clank didn&#039;t seem to notice. It simply leaned forward, shining its lights on Spike&#039;s face. The engine&#039;s bell dinged in happy recognition.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you know something about this, Twilight?&quot; Spike asked, lightsaber held at the ready.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the engine... which looked suspiciously like the one Adam Clay had been working on when she&#039;d returned from the university. She looked down at herself, clad in long Victorian-era undergarments... and covered up to the elbows in oil, grease, and soot.</p><p class="double">Oh yes, and there was the wrench in her hand. The one she&#039;d been sleeping with. That might also be a clue.</p><p class="double">Sleepwalking was one thing. Sleep-engineering? That was a new one for Twilight.</p><p class="double">Then the sleeping gas grenade hit the floor and released its payload, and the further adding of two plus two got postponed for a later date. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><i>what the hay was the princess wearing?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Nay, good Sir Crust,&quot; a voice emerged from over the ludicrous mass of crinkly neck ruff, &quot;prithee approach the throne!

REPENT! The end is neigh!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.3 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Castle Wulfenshy was a most fascinating place to be a prisoner.</p><p class="double">Of course, Twilight Clay wasn&#039;t really a prisoner prisoner. The Baron had a whole range of categories for those he kept against their will on his flying capital. The lowest step on that hierarchy, of course, was &quot;experimental subject.&quot; Somewhere in the middle was the group Spike had been shuttled into, &quot;potentially useful Sparks.&quot; Between the steam-engine clank, the lightsaber Spike had failed to put back in his subspace pocket before the C-gas knocked him out, and a bit of fast talking by Fluttershy, Spike had taken Twilight&#039;s place in the Baron&#039;s eyes as an emerging Spark, with Twilight as his girlfriend. This had the advantage of putting Twilight on the very top tier of the prisoner hierarchy: &quot;hostage.&quot;</p><p class="double">Most of the other hostages where students or children, all her age or younger, some as young as three or four years old. Twilight had had a brief and tense meeting with their governess, a construct- an artifical organic being assembled from spare parts, lightning, and Spark-driven insane genius- who went by the name of Madame Von Cheer. Twilight didn&#039;t know if Von Cheer was Cheerilee Looping; their meeting was very, very much in public, and thus &quot;in-character&quot; for the Loop.</p><p class="double">The cause of the confrontation had been Twilight&#039;s consultation with Fluttershy, or rather what happened after their conversation. Fluttershy had been trained in every form of mad science known, but her favorite branch of the science was biology. She&#039;d created the second generation wasp eaters, weasel-like multilegged creatures who could smell out those infected by the mind control insects used by the Other during the time of the Sparkle Boys. She&#039;d also created other things, including a squat construct in a trench coat and hat, with nothing but white floppy ears sticking out of their shadows. Fluttershy called it Angel; according to her, she&#039;d made him when she was eight.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy had also explained the main difficulty in escaping Castle Wulfenshy by demonstration- that is, she&#039;d taken Twilight for an impromptu ride on the biggest, ugliest, scariest fruit bat Twilight had ever seen in her life. Twilight had never seen a flying mammal that seats six before. (Dragons, yes. Bats, no.) The three of them (the two Loopers and the bat) had circled the vast, improbable airship which was the core of the Baron&#039;s fleet, riding miles above the European countryside below. The escapade had ended with a crash landing through some very large windows into the middle of a meeting of jagermonster generals. The entire flight had been visible from the childrens&#039; deck, and Von Cheer disapproved of the example Twilight had set.</p><p class="double">Twilight had gone on to compound her example by joining a group of the older students, ranging in age from hers down to an eleven year old boy, to secretly look at the slaver wasp engine that had been the direct cause of the Baron&#039;s visit to Beetleburg. The group had used a lighting gantry to see the Baron and his scientists studying the immense alien device; unfortunately the group far outweighed the recommended load for the gantry&#039;s supports. Things began to come apart when the eleven year old saw something in the shadows and panicked. One of the large lights fell off the gantry, and in short order the whole group had scrambled for safety just a short jump ahead of the Baron&#039;s footmen.</p><p class="double">In the confusion Twilight had become separated from the group, and now she walked alone in the service corridors of the mighty airship. She&#039;d quite forgotten the panicky flight from the gantry, idly strolling down the corridors and staring in wonder at the infrastructure of Castle Wulfenshy. How did it work? What did all the valves and pipes connect to? Where on Earth were the lift bags necessary to keep an airship the length of a Star Destroyer aloft?</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s mind had wandered so far from her body that it took several seconds to return when the body&#039;s progress was blocked by a dead end.</p><p class="double">Her first thought, naturally, was, Where&#039;s the door? She looked back up the corridor, which didn&#039;t have a turnoff anywhere between where she stood and the entrance a good hundred meters or more back. Either the ship had some very sloppy and unsafe design, which she didn&#039;t believe for an instant...</p><p class="double">... or there was a hidden door. With a hidden latch. Found. Click. Perfect.</p><p class="double">The secret door slid open to reveal a massive shaft running vertically though the ship. It sat empty except for a figure wearing khaki clothes, a bomber jacket and an old style aviator helmet and goggles. A handful of locks of hair peeked out from under the helmet, each one a different brilliant prismatic color. Each limb hung in chains from a different mounting position on the shaft&#039;s walls, the shackles totally encasing the prisoner&#039;s hands and feet in chromium steel.</p><p class="double">Apparently, Twilight mused, there is a spot on the Baron&#039;s hierarchy of prisoners below &quot;test subjects.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi there!&quot; the prisoner chirped, looking as confident and smug as if the two of them were seated at a Parisian cafe. &quot;So, you&#039;re the Baron&#039;s long-lost daughter? Well, you&#039;ve come just in time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;Is that you in there?&quot;</p><p class="double">The smug smile vanished, replaced by a suspicious stare. &quot;How do you know that... wait a minute. That hair. Is that you, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Clay, that&#039;s right,&quot; Twilight nodded. &quot;Don&#039;t use the other name. It&#039;ll cause trouble here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure would!&quot; Rainbow agreed. &quot;So that makes you the Long Lost Heir Seeking to Reclaim His or Her Throne! Even better!&quot; The smug smile was back, and Rainbow actually managed to lean in a casual manner in her chains. &quot;So, mind springing me? It&#039;s not that I need the help, as such. I am a hero, after all. I&#039;ll always find a way out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight paused to consider. If she released Dash, where would the wingless Looping peagsus-turned-human escape to? She&#039;d seen that getting off Castle Wulfenshy was no simple thing. &quot;Hold that thought,&quot; she said. &quot;You know who I am this Loop, but who are you, exactly? And what did you do to get the Baron to lock you up so... thoroughly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m glad you asked,&quot; Rainbow grinned, and out of nowhere an umpah band struck up a jaunty tune.</p><p class="double">Rainbow sang:</p><p class="double"><i>The world today is gloomy</p><p>All woe and sad and doomy</p><p>And the prospects for improvement are quite dark</p><p>It gets worse every season</p><p>And I think I know the reason</p><p>It&#039;s the fault of everyone who has the Spark</p><p>So pardon my exposition</p><p>As I tell you of my mission</p><p>To free Europa from this tyranny</p><p>By removing every Spark-</i></p><p class="double">Twilight interrupted:</p><p class="double"><i>You can&#039;t mean EVERY Spark!</i></p><p class="double">Rainbow nodded and replied:</p><p class="double"><i>Yes, I mean it, every one- including ME!</i></p><p class="double">The chains which had held Rainbow spreadeagled loosened enough for her to strike a dramatic pose for the chorus.</p><p class="double"><i>For I am Rainbow Tryggvasen, Aviatrix Adventurer</p><p>The greatest hero ever known to man</p><p>If you think that evil can never be defeated</p><p>Well, Rainbow Tryggvasen surely can!</i></p><p class="double">The fanfares faded back into standard umpah music for the second verse.</p><p class="double"><i>Where the people are in danger</p><p>I will never be a stranger</p><p>I will always come a-soaring to their aid</p><p>When the helpless cry in terror</p><p>The bad guys best beware, or</p><p>They&#039;ll learn the meaning of the word &#039;afraid&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Suddenly compartments opened in the shaft, allowing several serving girls and airmen to sing:</p><p class="double"><i>She&#039;s a fighter!

Of course.</p><p class="double">And so Twilight did.</p><p class="double">Oh, there were a few disputes about whether or not the circus dared risk harboring an obvious runaway from Castle Wulfenshy, but a sudden attack by autonomous mechanical scorpions and the swift application of a death ray Twilight had cobbled together from the wreckage of her airship lifeboat settled those disputes most amicably.</p><p class="double">And now, as the rest of the circus roasted marshmallows around the burning remains of the robot bugs, five figures sat in one of the larger circus wagons, doors and windows shut so the conversation could not be overheard. Opalescence, the Empress of All Cats, might or might not have been Awake, but Twilight had already learned it&#039;s impossible to keep a secret from a cat that has thumbs and can speak the same language as you. Members three and four of the conference owned the wagon and ran the circus- Madam Trixie von Payne&#039;s Traveling Sparkle Show, featuring the incomparable acting talents of Krystalis, Landgravine of a long list of names which Trixie delighted in pointing out had all been wasteland for centuries.</p><p class="double">&quot;I actually rather enjoy this Loop,&quot; Trixie said, sipping her cocoa. &quot;I mean, I love a big boom as much as the next mare, but I feel like this circus is getting back to my roots. I&#039;ve been practicing my illusions a lot more, and since magic in this Loop is really weak without mechanical aids I&#039;ve been learning more about props, too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And for me,&quot; Chrysalis said, &quot;it&#039;s been relaxing not having thousands of voices in my head asking for orders, begging for help, bickering over the least little things. No hive mind, no responsibilities. I only have to boss one person. Her,&quot; she said, pointing at Trixie. &quot;And in exchange I get to learn about imitating others without the use of magic.&quot; She grinned and added, &quot;Of course, the alchemy does help.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie being a Spark, a low-level one, hadn&#039;t surprised Twilight in the least. Chrysalis being a Spark was only a mild surprise. Learning that more than half the show were minor Sparks hiding in plain sight as hokey actors, charlatans, and song-and-dance people- show folk, in other words- had surprised Twilight quite a bit.</p><p class="double">But then there was the big surprise- the fifth member of the conference, who was one of the circus members that wasn&#039;t a Spark. She was fairly lean, except for the spots of superfluous fat that the female human body seemed to insist on no matter how inconvenient they were. Aside from those obvious exceptions the woman was muscle through and through, an obvious fighter. (The pair of double-bladed swords strapped to her back were an extra little hint.) Her skin had a faint orangish tint with freckles on her cheeks, and her hair was an eye-twitching mix of green and golden locks.</p><p class="double">&quot;I reckon th&#039; vacation just ended,&quot; Applejack Daughter of Chump said. &quot;Gotta say, it&#039;s been fun havin&#039; a purely physical Loop. I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t get stuck with that crazy egghead stuff like you all did. But all good things gotta end sometime.&quot; She leaned forward towards the lantern and said, &quot;So, what do we do, fearless leader?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know what the Loop wants me to do,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I&#039;ve heard three different Sparkle Boys stories since I Awoke. My adoptive parents told me to go to their capital, Mechanicsburg, where the castle would help me. And when we first met, Trixie mentioned that you were traveling to Mechanicsburg. You don&#039;t have to trip a hoof on the train rails to know they&#039;re there.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, are we still going to do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. &quot;Believe me, I&#039;ve been seriously considering derailing this Loop and going to Paris to learn all I can about the technowizardry of this world. But Fluttershy had a point. She told me that Sparks, and especially female Sparks, are walking targets in this world. I&#039;d be spending the entire Loop fending off attacks, kidnapping attempts, and all sorts of other stuff. That would be really inconvenient. I mean, all the interruptions!&quot; Twilight tossed her hands in the air. &quot;When would I ever find time to finish a book?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, Mechanicsburg, then,&quot; Trixie nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;At least I&#039;ll get some idea of what this Loop&#039;s baseline is supposed to be, if we ever get thrown into this world again. But I tell you, if this Loop doesn&#039;t shape up and fly right, I swear to Redwood I&#039;m going to go full Eternal Twilight on this place, and if I end up in G3 or Eiken again, so be it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Funny you should mention, &#039;shape up,&quot; Applejack drawled, leaning across the lantern and poking a finger into Twilight&#039;s corset. It went in a good ways.</p><p class="double">Twilight felt a twinge of apprehension.</p><p class="double">&quot;I noticed you were lookin&#039; a bit flabby there, in the fight against those robot critters.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trepidation.</p><p class="double">&quot;And, y&#039;know, it&#039;s three months&#039; travel at least from here to Mechanicsburg.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fear.</p><p class="double">&quot;And we&#039;ll be spending a lot of nights out here in the wilderness, with robots and monsters and bandits and all sorts of nasty stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Dread.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;And here I am, princess from a lost city jus&#039; chock fulla all sorts of martial arts trainin&#039; techniques.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>Panic.</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t eat too heavy tonight, Twilight,&quot; Applejack said, grinning a most evil grin. &quot;Wake-up time is an hour before dawn. We&#039;ve got a LOT o&#039; trainin&#039; to do.&quot;</p><p class="double">As memories of other loops Twilight had spent trapped with martial arts geniuses swam through her brain, her only coherent thought was: <i>Not again.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double"><u><i>what the hay was the princess </i><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m a little teapot, short and stout...&quot; Celestia sang.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><u><i>what the hay was the princess </i><i>wearing?</i></u></p><p class="double">&quot;The night... shall last...

She and her friends had handled Nightmare Moon a few days ago (it was Pinkie&#039;s turn to defeat non-looping Nightmare Moon, and her plan had somehow resulted in the redeemed Princess Luna having to <i>eat</i> her way of an enormous caramel flan). All six had agreed on a baseline loop, and that meant Twilight knew for a fact that the next stampede wasn&#039;t due for days.</p><p class="double">&quot;The orange! THE ORANGE!&quot; cried the stampeding ponies as Twilight went to see what the problem was.</p><p class="double">It was a little obvious: a utter horde of identical orange pegasus ponies swarming the town. Twilight frowned: she knew who that was, and also she knew that he <i>barking</i> knew Equestria was supposed to be a sanctuary loop!</p><p class="double">Naruto better have a <i>really</i> good reason for panicking all of Ponyville.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Naruto had a <i>horribly</i> good reason for panicking all of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">As soon as the kage bushin spotted the sparks Twilight had sent up to get their attention, she&#039;d been dog-piled and practically dragged bodily to where the original was waiting. She&#039;d just opened her mouth to ask what he&#039;d been thinking when Twilight found herself being desperately hugged.</p><p class="double">&quot;What <i>happened?</i>&quot; Twilight found herself asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s...you remember back when the last Crash happened, right?&quot; Naruto explained, &quot;And how it got most of the loops a new looper or two?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course,&quot; Twilight replied, &quot;We got three.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even though they were talking, Naruto kept watch on their surroundings. It was like he expected something horrible to jump out and attack them any second. Twilight had never seen Naruto so on edge before...no, wait, she had. But not since the first time they&#039;d met, right before they&#039;d proven themselves as a sanctuary by using the Elements of Harmony to banish his teammate Sakura to the moon.</p><p class="double">It gave her a terrible sense of foreboding.</p><p class="double">&quot;Three? Lucky you,&quot; Naruto said, &quot;We only got one - Inari-chan was really surprised a loop as old as ours got any newbies at all.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, though at the same time she went over a mental list of villains from Naruto&#039;s loop. Surely having one of them start looping was the reason Naruto was so tense. Which one, though? One of Akatsuki? Or maybe Madara? Whoever, it was, it had to be someone really -</p><p class="double">&quot;And while Inari-chan was busy telling me we finally, <i>finally</i> had a new looper...Sakura found him first.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight instantly discarded her mental list.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Mulberry</i>,&quot; she swore, &quot;Is he...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look for yourself,&quot; Naruto answered grimly.</p><p class="double">Naruto pulled a copy of Harry&#039;s invisibility cloak off a pony standing behind him, and Twilight&#039;s heart sank. The pony in question was standing upright, but his eyes were vacant. Whoever it was, their body was perfectly healthy but their mind was definitely not at home.</p><p class="double">The silver mane, mis-matched eyes, and scarecrow cutie mark just made the sight that much worse.</p><p class="double">&quot;Put the cloak back on,&quot; Twilight said, as gently as possible, &quot;We&#039;ll take him back to the library, and I&#039;ll see what we can do.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.1 alternate (Misterq)</p><p class="double"><i>his mind shut down as he stared at the thirty identical Princess Celestias bouncing off the floor, walls, and ceiling like toy rubber balls; each one was grinning and chanting &#039;Fun!

Even if it&#039;s smaller than usual.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.5 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">No one was quite sure how Eden Hall and its owner/Anchor Sasakura Ryuu kept ending up in the massive fused Loops where numerous Anchors were in attendance, but there were no complaints whatsoever. Right now, those Anchors present were engaging in one of their favorite pastimes.</p><p class="double">Embarrassing the heck out of each other.</p><p class="double">&quot;And here&#039;s &#039;Rapid Hooves&#039; on a date with my friends Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy while they weren&#039;t Awake,&quot; Twilight grinned, showing a picture of an extremely nervous stallion being kissed on each cheek by both mares at the same time.</p><p class="double">&quot;It was <i>weird</i>,&quot; Ranma insisted. &quot;They both decided they liked me and they were <i>civil</i> about it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Power of friendship Ranma-san,&quot; Twilight kept grinning. &quot;What did you <i>think</i> would happen when you saved a horde of endangered bunnies using superhero-grade feats?&quot;</p><p class="double">The original Anchor just buried his head in the table and moaned.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s nothing!&quot; cheered one Monkey D. Luffy, Anchor of the piratical One Piece Loop. &quot;Wanna see my pictures of Naruto when he looped in as one of my crew?&quot;</p><p class="double">Everyone&#039;s attention was riveted. Luffy&#039;s crew was famous/infamous across the Loops for the ridiculous adventures they had and the ludicrous battles they always ended up involved in. Luffy was one of the few loopers in the multiverse who had fought Bobobo and <i>liked</i> it.</p><p class="double">But before Luffy could start, the door to the bar opened and everyone present immediately conceded the embarrassing photo contest.</p><p class="double">Kyon, the Anchor who generally rode herd on Haruhi and her home Loop, had arrived.</p><p class="double">Not that this would stop the stories from being told, of course. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">54.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;...so for some reason, the sorting hat puts me in Hufflepuff! Hufflepuff, of all houses!&quot; Trixie rolled her eyes. &quot;Luckily, Harry was awake and he ended up in the same house. And, well, the long and short of it is we ended up conquering magical Britain within two years.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis snickered. &quot;I can believe it. So, what about... you two?&quot; She turned to the couple sitting across the table, managing to keep from flinching. &quot;Any fun Hogwarts stories?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor pulled his ears back. &quot;Oh, no...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance snickered. &quot;Ooooooh yes. See, when we looped in we&#039;d replaced Ron and Hermoine--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem...&quot; An oddly nervous pony trotted up to the table. &quot;I... hate to interrupt, but, ah--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, right.&quot; Chrysalis sighed. &quot;That. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ve already laid them, Mandible.&quot; She wrote something sown on a slip of paper and passed it to him. &quot;That&#039;s the code, and remember it&#039;s the blue chest with green filigree. Trixie, you don&#039;t mind if he visits the wagon without us?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, it&#039;s cool.&quot; The showmare leaned back. &quot;Just don&#039;t raid the pantry.&quot;</p><p class="double">Mandible nodded to both of them. &quot;Thank you, my queen. Good day, miss Lulamoon... and, er, friends?&quot; He glanced at Cadance and Shining warily.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry, they&#039;re looping too.&quot; Chrysalis smiled, patting his head fondly. &quot;Go on, then, you&#039;ve got three weeks to watch over them before they hatch!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie shrugged as the drone went on his merry way. &quot;I don&#039;t know if the hive mind thing makes the loops easier to explain or not, but it certainly makes your subjects more nervous then any pony I&#039;ve ever explained it to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think it&#039;s because they can experience what I experienced, really understand.&quot; Chrysalis shrugged. &quot;Anyway, what were you two saying about Hermoine and Ron?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, nononono, stop.&quot; Cadance glared at her. &quot;You laid eggs?! I thought having children was impossible in the loops!&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen blinked. With a sigh, she brought a hoof to her forehead. &quot;...Thirty three thousand, six hundred, fifty three.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Barring any deaths, ponies that are secretly changelings, or other swarms that exist only for one iteration of Equestria... That&#039;s how many changelings there are in my swarm by the end of a loop. Thirty three thousand, six hundred, fifty three.&quot; Chrysalis met the alicorn&#039;s gaze. &quot;Sometimes some of them are neoqueens or actual queens, sometimes they&#039;re all mindless automatons following my commands, sometimes they&#039;re converted ponies. But in the end, they generally all have the same names... or numbers, if the loop likes, as they&#039;ve always had. I&#039;m not having new children, Cadance. I&#039;m only having children that the loop already says I would have had anyway.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I feel it&#039;s best to get it all out of the way near the start, but things got in the way this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadance blushed. &quot;Oh. Um. Sorry, I just thought... you know, that you&#039;d found a loophole or something, and me and Shining could...&quot; She trailed off, rubbing her foreleg awkwardly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Honey...&quot; Shining Armor nuzzled her gently.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it&#039;s... it&#039;s okay. I can handle this...&quot; Cadance took a breath. &quot;It&#039;s not forever. Just a very long time. I&#039;m good.</p><p class="double">Trixie and Chrysalis shared a look as the two had their moment, each trying to silently ask the other what exactly they should do or if maybe they should just leave or--</p><p class="double">&quot;So!&quot; Cadance said a little too brightly. &quot;You and, uh, Mandible huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen shook her head. &quot;It&#039;s not like that, it was just a simple mating meeting... haven&#039;t you ever wondered why they&#039;re all called drones?&quot; She rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;And...&quot; Shining gave Trixie a look. &quot;You&#039;re okay with this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Chrysalis is a shapeshifting erovore who happens to be the queen – in the insect sense – of the entire swarm.&quot; The showmare shrugged. &quot;I&#039;ve accepted that she has a social and biological obligation. Heck, sometimes I join in.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nuzzled her marefriend. &quot;Just remember, Trixie, that many drones and ponies have had my body but only two have ever had my heart. And one of those...&quot; She gave Shining an embarrassed smile. &quot;Well... you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awwwwwwww!&quot; Cadance brought her forehooves together with a happy grin. &quot;That is so sweet! I can&#039;t wait till you two get married.&quot;</p><p class="double">Instantly Chrysalis and Trixie separated.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Married?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Us?!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All that paperwork, and arranging the whole shebang--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d look gaudy with a ring on my horn--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And there&#039;s the whole part where I <i>have</i> to have drones in my bed--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And flirting with my audience gets me much better ratings if I&#039;m single--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, no, we don&#039;t want to end up in a loveless marriage,&quot; Chrysalis concluded.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;d much prefer a marriageless love,&quot; Trixie stated with a firm nod.</p><p class="double">Cadance blinked. &quot;But... it worked out so well for Spike and Rarity!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who have to jump a few loopholes or hide their relationship from nonawake ponies due to the age difference,&quot; Trixie deadpanned.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Well, Shining and I are happy!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Didn&#039;t a swarm of shapeshifters invade and lock you in a cave?&quot; Chrysalis mused.</p><p class="double">&quot;But... but... wedding!&quot; The alicorn turned to her husband. &quot;Help me out here.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn took a deep breath. &quot;Honey... I think you may have a bit of an addiction.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?

<p>55.1</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, and was slightly surprised to be confronted with a book on comparative political history.</p><p class="double">“Huh.

Especially as they seemed to still have a sun goddess...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Gilda said, cracking her knuckles. “I have to go to this boring backwater town where they farm dirt, and help with some flower festival or something. Seriously?”</p><p class="double">Her ruler and mentor barked.</p><p class="double">“I gotta admit,” the tiny green thing on her ruler&#039;s nose said, bouncing up and down, “It doesn&#039;t sound all that exciting, Ammy.

May all be doomed under my great power and many tails!”</p><p class="double"><i>Ah.</p><p class="double"></i>Gilda reached into her Pocket and summoned Thunder Edge, making the huge blade flash into being on her back. “This is why I&#039;m an idiot.

In a clashing discharge of magic, the Demon Lord exploded into nine pony-sized foxes. “Quick, knock them out before he pulls himself together!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I remember this guy,” Twilight commented, picking up two of the foxes and bashing their heads together. “Didn&#039;t expect to see him here, though.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, well, given that our ruler is Amaterasu I should have expected it.” Another lightning bolt, this one leaping off Thunder Edge, crashed into one of the foxes and it collapsed with a stink of burned fur.</p><p class="double">The remaining six regrouped, and with a flash the huge kitsune was back – but with three fewer tails.</p><p class="double">“This could take a while...” Twilight observed.</p><p class="double">Gilda&#039;s reply was a feral grin. “My kind of entertainment!”</p><p class="double"><i><hr></p><p class="double">“</i><i>Seriously?”</i> Gilda said, open beaked. “He nearly killed us, like, six times!

I-”</p><p class="double">“Thought so!” Gilda crowed. “You two <i>are</i> looping!”</p><p class="double">Amaterasu gave Issun a look.

Right.” Twilight nodded. “I understand the sentiment. Anyway, as the local Anchor, welcome to what&#039;s usually Equestria.”</p><p class="double">The sun goddess bounded over and licked her snout.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a pity Fluttershy isn&#039;t looping, she&#039;d love you...” Twilight giggled. “You know, you&#039;re a lot more fun than Celestia is in her public appearances...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gilda put the finishing touches on her latest piece of work – a sumi-e cartoon about how she&#039;d been getting on living with Twilight over in the Pony Lands.</p><p class="double">“That looks like a familiar chore,” Twilight commented, looking it over. “I like how you&#039;ve portrayed me.”</p><p class="double">The griffin chuckled. “Yeah, it is kinda like those friendship reports, isn&#039;t it? You know, it isn&#039;t as easy as it looks...”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, it&#039;s kinda hard not to accidentally cast magic, sometimes.” Gilda folded the paper into an origami crane. “Right, if I&#039;ve got this right...”</p><p class="double">The crane fluttered into the air, and set off west.</p><p class="double">“Nice,” the unicorn commented.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s special paper,” Gilda shrugged. “Must be a lot easier for you, what with the dragon and all.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I take your point.”</p><p class="double">The conversation stalled at that point, Twilight not having anything more to say and Gilda unwilling to break the silence for a while.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s strange, you know...” Gilda said eventually.</p><p class="double">“Oh?”</p><p class="double">“Well, the whole brush-magic thing is kind of what&#039;s made me... well, who I am, as a looper. As my own person in the loops. And now there&#039;s Amaterasu, there, who&#039;s <i>way</i> better than me. Hay, <i>Issun</i> is better than me.”</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped closer and touched her shoulder. Gilda controlled a slight flinch, and sighed. “Yeah, I get the picture.”</p><p class="double">“Badum tish,” Twilight said, deadpan. Then started again, more seriously. “I don&#039;t really know what that&#039;s like. Since I&#039;m an Anchor, I tend to be... well, the best at my speciality. It&#039;s because we have so much more time, really.”</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged.</p><p class="double">“But... well, you&#039;re not just an inky tailtip, Gilda. You&#039;re more violent than most of the rest of us, which might not necessarily be a good thing, but you seem in control of it – and that makes you good when we have to deal with... fighty... situations.”</p><p class="double">The griffin snorted. “Kinda ran out of steam, there.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Twilight agreed.</p><p class="double">After a pause, Twilight spoke up again. “Hey, who&#039;s this world going to use for Discord?”</p><p class="double">“Good question...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So,” Issun asked, laughter in his voice, “How&#039;d you deal with Lechku and Nechku?”</p><p class="double">Twilight pointed a hoof at him. “Your world has <i>stupid</i> enemies.”</p><p class="double">Gilda tried to soothe down more of her ruffled feathers. “What. The hell. Was that.”</p><p class="double">The ruler of Griffon barked.</p><p class="double">“Yes,” Gilda added, abandoning her task to give Amaterasu a piercing stare. “I <i>know</i> that they were giant clockwork demonic owls with top hats and monocles. I was more asking <i>why</i> they were giant clockwork demonic owls with top hats and monocles.”</p><p class="double">Ninetails raised a paw. “We&#039;re from Japan.”</p><p class="double">“...yeah, that explains a lot, actually...” Twilight allowed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.2</p><p class="double">“Okay, I don&#039;t get it.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Spike asked, looking up and flipping his lightsaber hand to hand.</p><p class="double">“Well...” Anakin paused. “I mean... okay, look. Despite what you may have encountered in the base line for my loop, I&#039;m not generally psychotic.”</p><p class="double">“Nah.” The dragon (well, winged bipedal lizard with clawed hands) shrugged. “I know – I was actually Obi-wan one of my first loops,&nbsp;&nbsp;which meant we put the kibosh on quite a lot of what was supposed to go wrong with the Republic.” He picked the lightsaber out of the air – after he&#039;d stopped juggling it, it had frozen where it was. “It was kind of fun.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Anakin shook his head. “I can sort of see you as Obi-Wan now, but if that was one of your first loops...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, loudest-mouthed jedi knight in the Republic,” Spike confirmed. “Well, until your baseline self lost his braid.”</p><p class="double">“I may have lost my train of thought,” Anakin apologized. “Right. Okay, well, what I was getting at was – it&#039;s really rare to encounter a looper who&#039;s an all-up Jedi. All the ones I tend to meet are Gray Jedi, but you&#039;re effectively a straight lightsider.”</p><p class="double">“I think it&#039;s because of how my personality is structured.” They stood, and began to walk down a hall in the Temple. “See, as a dragon, I have this deep-seated need to have a hoard.”</p><p class="double">“This sounds more like a reason why you <i>shouldn&#039;t</i> be a lightsider than a reason you should be,” Anakin observed as they turned a corner.</p><p class="double">“Well, yeah, but meditation helps. In the end, I solved it by redirecting it – one example is my wife.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re married?” Anakin asked, interested. A couple of passing Knights gave them very strange looks. “Oh, grow up!” he added sharply.</p><p class="double">This did not improve the nature of the looks.</p><p class="double">“Are you people all dense?” he checked. “Ki-adi-mundi has at least three wives and five kids!”</p><p class="double">“Ah, it doesn&#039;t matter,” Spike said, loudly enough to be heard. “I mean, that&#039;s how the Sunrider clan got going, and they practically founded the modern order.”</p><p class="double">The shocked looks died away, to be replaced by confused muttering.</p><p class="double">“As I was saying,” Spike resumed, “I&#039;m a dragon, she&#039;s the most precious thing I possess. But, at the same time, I belong to <i>her</i> in return.”</p><p class="double">Anakin blinked. “That works?”</p><p class="double">“Apparently.” Spike&#039;s smile was slightly distant. “It&#039;s a huge relief, actually, for my draconic hindbrain. As far as I&#039;m concerned, I already have everything worth getting worked up about, which results in my feeling <i>remarkably</i> peaceful.”</p><p class="double">The occasionally-a-sith frowned. “One of these days, I&#039;ll have to try that line on wrinkleface, he&#039;d eat it up.”</p><p class="double">“Feel free – but for me it&#039;s true.”</p><p class="double">They reached a large durasteel door.</p><p class="double">“Okay, where now?” Spike asked.</p><p class="double">“...I was following you.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s your home loop,” Spike pointed out reasonably.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Anakin drew his lightsaber and lit it. “I refuse to admit we made a wrong turning, so the force must have guided us here.”</p><p class="double">“You seriously don&#039;t know what&#039;s behind the door?” Spike checked. “Wow. Somehow, not what I&#039;d expect from an Anchor...”</p><p class="double">“Hey, this is the Galactic Republic. There&#039;s a <i>lot</i> of small details which are variant between loops. Like, where planets are...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay,” Spitfire said, coming up to Dash with an ever-so-slightly furtive air. “Look, you know how one of our team is out? As in, in the hospital?”</p><p class="double">Dash nodded. “Well, yeah.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. That&#039;s... well, not to be too blunt about it, but I was wondering if you would consider...”</p><p class="double">The rainbow-maned pegasus looked at Spitfire. “Sorry, I don&#039;t understand.”</p><p class="double">Spitfire fought the urge to facehoof.</p><p class="double">Mind you, she still felt she could talk Dash around eventually. She&#039;d always dreamed of being a Wonderbolt, after all.</p><p class="double">It was better for her this way.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...I have no idea how this happened,” Spitfire said, in a slightly distracted voice.</p><p class="double">Rarity made a few minor adjustments to Spitfire’s new team jersey. “Glad to have you, dear. I have to say, that coat of yours is just <i>gorgeous</i>!”</p><p class="double">Dash nodded. “Yeah, looks good. Now, come on, Twi&#039;s going to give us a strategy talk!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.4</p><p class="double">“Alright, girlie,” a voice with a strong Trottingham accent said, “I don&#039;t see what the Captain&#039;s getting at, but-”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo almost panicked. This was <i>not</i> a baseline loop – she couldn&#039;t feel her wings.</p><p class="double">After a moment, she refocused. <i>Okay. I&#039;m human. Female, about seventeen...</p><p class="double"></i>She reached into her Pocket, and got nothing. <i>Ah, great. One of these loops.</p><p class="double"></i>“Are you listening, girlie? Thinking about your lacework?”</p><p class="double">Things started to click, reminding her of a loop from long, long ago.</p><p class="double">“No, sir, just eager!” she said smartly, saluting. If she was right, this could be an <i>interesting </i>loop – doubly so because the loop had preserved her normal gender.</p><p class="double">The man in front of her – a Flying Officer in the RFC – harrumphed. “Well, a moment&#039;s inattention in the air can get you killed, <i>private.</i> In fact, I&#039;m not at all sure this bloody wheeze from Whitehall is worth a thing – women fighting!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll go you three rounds in any aircraft you care to name, sir!” she pressed, still using that respectful, polished tone that wasn&#039;t <i>quite</i> insubordination.</p><p class="double">Pansy had taught her once. She&#039;d found it useful handling Commander Hurricane.</p><p class="double">“Fiesty little scrap, aren&#039;t you!” The Flying Officer shook his head. “Well, you were sent out as a pilot, so I suppose if you crash in the first five minutes at least it solves this whole bloody mess. One aircraft&#039;s cheap at the price...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As she walked out to one of the Sopwith Camels sitting on the grassy strip, Scootaloo ran back over what she was sure of about the loop so far.</p><p class="double">First – she had a cousin who was assuredly Sweetie and almost certainly Awake, posted with her to the new experimental Women&#039;s Auxiliary Flying Corps.</p><p class="double">The somewhat torturous logic the brass seemed to be using was that a woman flying an aircraft would free up a male pair of eyes to do a competent job of observing, and that the man could fly them to and from the observation site so that the woman didn&#039;t get her dainty hands sore. The practical upshot of which was, she and Sweetie – and unspecified others – would be forming a squadron of aircraft in a close-to-hub-world version of world war one.</p><p class="double">Second, their genius of an engineer was (of course) Apple “Sparky” Bloomer. Admittedly, Applebloom was much less able to perform anything too miraculous without her Pocket, but there were miracles and there were<i> miracles</i>.</p><p class="double">And third, she was Replacing James “Biggles” Bigglesworth. Which meant that, for all the “human” thing, and all the army politics, and all the annoyance of no subspace pocket, she had essentially been given a loop to go wild as a pilot in for over thirty five years.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Sopwith Camel was a strange plane. It was certainly effective, capable of flight with two passengers, and well armed by the standards of the time... but, among other peculiarities, it had so much torque on the engine that it was quicker to turn left by turning <i>right</i> than the conventional way.</p><p class="double">But in the hands of Sally “Scoots” Cooper, it <i>danced.</i> The poor Flt. Lt, completely unready for facing one of the great aces of the multiverse in the body of a teenaged girl, could barely keep track of her as she toyed with him for ten straight minutes.</p><p class="double">“Alright, I&#039;ve seen enough!” he eventually shouted, as she “bounced” him yet again. “Now land at No.1 strip.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And ah hope you didn&#039;t crack the undercarriage,” Applebloom fussed, checking the spark plugs on the aircraft&#039;s engine. “That&#039;s a nightmare to fix, that is.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo leant against the cowling. “I make no promises, Sparky.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, stop calling me that,” the mechanic groused. “Ah don&#039;t always like in-loop nicknames, and that&#039;s one ah don&#039;t like.”</p><p class="double">“You know as well as I do that you don&#039;t get to choose your <i>own</i> nickname... Sparky,” Scootaloo teased.</p><p class="double">Applebloom waved a wrench threateningly.</p><p class="double">After a moment, she shrugged. “Ah&#039;ve been called worse. So, what&#039;s the plan?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Scootaloo thought. “First thing, do what we can to end the war – and the next – with as little loss of life as possible.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha. Though we can&#039;t do much without our pockets...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Scootaloo frowned. She was going to miss Pansy&#039;s help, especially in a loop like this one, quite apart from how they&#039;d be limited to what was physically possible with no way to access magic.</p><p class="double">“Second thing,” she resumed, “Make it as clear as possible that the women thing is working. Like, we get me and Sweetie and whoever else joins us to be the greatest fighter aces we can – national heroes, basically.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom thought that over. “Yeah, makes sense. Less complicated than throwin&#039; ourselves under horses.”</p><p class="double">“Which would be just confusing,” Scootaloo agreed. “And third... I want a turbojet. By, like, 1930.”</p><p class="double">She got a grin in reply. “Try asking me for something <i>hard</i> next time.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“An excellent performance by the Supermarine aircraft there,” the Schneider announcer said over the public address system. “Of course, the Supermarine aircraft company won the last competition in a shut-out, but there is still one racer remaining to compete. Regular spectators may recall that the 1927 entry by the Bloomer aircraft company was unable to race due to severe engine faults, so I hope you&#039;ll join me in wishing them a good run for their 1929 showing. Pilot of the Bloomer Pensee is the famed lady fighter ace, Sally Cooper, and their start time is in ten minutes.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Are you sure you fixed the turbine problem this time?” Scootaloo asked, for the twentieth time.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure!” Applebloom replied, hurt. “It was a bad batch of tungsten, alright?”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not the one who&#039;s going to be flying it...” Scootaloo muttered, climbing the ladder. “Okay, is everything ready?”</p><p class="double">Their rich sponsor, Lady Diana Thompson, waved. “Come back okay, Scoots,” she added. “I&#039;d be <i>dreadfully</i> sorry if this investment came to nothing.”</p><p class="double">“And the fact that my own personal body&#039;d be in a thousand minced bits isn&#039;t a concern?”</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara – for she it was – shrugged. “You&#039;ve got more.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s cold...” Scootaloo mock-shivered, then flipped the final switches. “Number one engine fine... number two fine... okay, guys, clear the takeoff area, this is gonna get loud.”</p><p class="double">She pulled the canopy closed, grinning as it sealed with a smooth <i>click</i>. The extra two years of work had let them build in all kinds of neat gadgets, though it still sucked they hadn&#039;t managed a public flight in 1927.</p><p class="double">Technically, they could have revealed the Pensee in early &#039;28, but somehow this felt far more dramatic.</p><p class="double">She reached for the twin throttles, took a deep breath, then eased them forwards. A low rumble built to a roar, and the wheels inside the tarmac-compatible float undercarriage began to turn.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was almost immediately obvious to Air Commodore Dowding that something new was afoot. The sound coming from the secretive Bloomer team&#039;s hanger was like nothing he&#039;d ever heard from an aircraft before.</p><p class="double">And, as it slowly nosed out of the door into the brilliant sunlight, it was like nothing he&#039;d ever <i>seen</i> before.</p><p class="double">There was no propeller.</p><p class="double">Rather than a single engine, it had two pods – one on each wing – emitting the roar he had heard moments before.</p><p class="double">And the floats seemed almost to be a concession to the rules. They were no doubt well designed, but they <i>looked</i> like an afterthought – this was a plane built for the land.</p><p class="double">All in all, it was <i>very</i> interesting for a rising man in the Air Ministry. It brought back shades of the legendary début of <i>Turbinia</i> at the 1897 Admiralty review.</p><p class="double">The roar increased, and his eyebrows rose in spite of themselves as the Pensee cannoned forwards, far faster than even the S.6 of an hour previously. The speed was impossible to accurately estimate, but if Dowding was any judge, the aircraft had at a stroke broken both the 400 m.p.h barrier and the 500 m.p.h barrier.</p><p class="double">The skid-floats parted company with the runway as though they didn&#039;t want to be associated with it. The Pensee tilted back, making an angle of at least twenty degrees of climb, and shrank at seven thousand vertical feet per minute – on top of that blistering forward speed.</p><p class="double">After a minute or so, the roar was gone into a clear blue sky, and the hubbub began.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo grinned as the cockpit radio set pinged twice. To help her out, Applebloom had been kind enough to set up a crude form of radio direction finding beam to tell her when to turn.</p><p class="double">It let her pay full attention to squeezing every last wingpower out of the engines.</p><p class="double">“Hey,” she said, pushing the transmit key. “Should I buzz the stands? I reckon if I do a dive, I can kiss the sound barrier.”</p><p class="double">“That is a deplorably showy idea,” Tiara replied. “Go for it.”</p><p class="double">“Awesome.” Scootaloo tilted the Pensee up a little, aiming for height to fuel her dive. “One loud noise coming up.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How&#039;d it go?” the ace asked that evening, after a wild party.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ve got four orders for private pleasure planes, and one Air Ministry contract to denavalize the Pansee and produce a hundred a year as soon as possible,” Tiara answered, putting a pair of glasses down. “You know how we got rich by inventing the dynamic speaker and the pot transistor?”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo nodded.</p><p class="double">“That was being well off. <i>Now</i> we&#039;re rich.” Tiara pointed to the papers. “Essentially, we <i>are</i> the British fighter industry now.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Diana/Tiara said, sitting down in the drawing room of her manor. “I think it&#039;s time we discussed the glaring issue right now.”</p><p class="double">“Which is?” Nell Xander asked, sitting back. A bright young lass and a crackerjack pilot, she&#039;d come to the attention of Sally and the others about a year earlier. (Or, to be more accurate, Nyx had let them know she was around too.)</p><p class="double">“Well...” Tiara exhaled sharply. “Basically, we broke World War Two.”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t follow.” Sweetie frowned. “I&#039;m not good on Hub-parallel world history.”</p><p class="double">“Understandable.” Tiara nodded to her. “The basic version is, a particularly ugly kind of nationalism headed by an equally malodorous fellow who made Sombra look sensible kicked the whole thing off in 1939, after a few years of ratcheting tensions, and it connected with a couple of brushfire wars to eventually go global. It involved just about every country in the world.”</p><p class="double">“So... it&#039;s late?” Scootaloo ventured, glancing over at the calendar.</p><p class="double">It persisted in showing the date to be June 2, 1940.</p><p class="double">“Unlike the rest of you, I&#039;ve not been up to my elbows in jet aircraft,” Tiara sniffed. “<i>I&#039;ve</i> been paying attention to the world situation. For a start, by now, Austria shouldn&#039;t exist. I looked up the person who was supposed to be in charge of Germany, and he&#039;s a<i> painter</i>.”</p><p class="double">There was silence for a moment, as they contemplated the sheer magnitude of the change to history that that entailed.</p><p class="double">“Yay?” Sweetie ventured.</p><p class="double">“Oh, unquestionably,” Tiara nodded to her. “I mean, it&#039;s all rather to the good.”</p><p class="double">“So...” Scootaloo raised a hand. “What do we do now? I mean, it&#039;s great and all, but... well... fighter pilots?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, I was getting to that.” The Lady picked up a document from her bureau. “That nice Mr. Dowding contacted you through me, asking if you could help with a rash of crimes involving aircraft. He seems to think that an organization of expert pilots with prototype aircraft coming out of their ears could be useful for that sort of thing...”</p><p class="double">“You mean that we basically get to fight crime in aircraft?” Scootaloo checked. “That&#039;s awesome!”</p><p class="double">Tiara smiled. “I may have suggested the idea to him in the first place. Now, we rather assumed that you&#039;d accept, so here&#039;s the first case.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo snatched the paper out of her hands. “Notorious criminal Julius Gontermann has been stealing jewellery from long haul transport flights?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom clapped her hands together. “I&#039;ll wheel out those two prototype Clovers we were making for the Fleet Air Arm.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jean-Luc Picard, usually of Starfleet, sat back in his villa garden with a puzzled frown.</p><p class="double">As a student of history, he knew full well that by now that Europe should have been embroiled in war – a war in which his own homeland, France, would come off decidedly second best. Despite his own variant of the Prime Directive, he&#039;d privately decided to join the Resistance when the time came.</p><p class="double">But, here it was, mid-1940... and no NSDAP, let alone World War Two. It was probably related to the unusually early appearance of jet aircraft, but it was impossible to tell for sure.</p><p class="double">A rumbling sound drew his attention, and he shaded his eyes to look into the bright Mediterranean sun.</p><p class="double">There were jet aircraft approaching from the south and east. Two of them were in a formation out in front; the one behind, an unusual two-boom design, was catching up fast.</p><p class="double">As he watched, the front two broke formation. One stayed on its single-minded course for somewhere in the direction of Bordeaux, the other lifted into a wingover to gain height.</p><p class="double">Picard stood, trying to follow what was going on. Thin streams of light darted from the first plane, trying to hit the wildly jinking pursuer, and he realized it was developing into a dogfight.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Scoots, are you sure this is going to work?” Nyx asked plaintively from the rear seat.</p><p class="double">“Sure I&#039;m sure,” Scootaloo replied, standing the Clover on one wing and sliding away from more cannon fire. “This is why I got Applebloom to fit a machine gun to the original Sea Vixen design – whoops!”</p><p class="double">A <i>clang</i> reverberated through the entire aircraft, as the other aircraft managed to get a hit with machine guns on her right wingtip.</p><p class="double">“Okay, now I&#039;m annoyed,” Scootaloo muttered. “Arm the no.1 missile.”</p><p class="double">“Armed,” Nyx supplied.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo fired it off, and watched with a grin as it exploded within seconds into a huge cloud of black smoke.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Julius Gontermann scowled. That trick rocket, whatever it was for, had made him lose sight of the agile British plane. With a pilot like Scoots on his case, he needed to down her fast or he was in trouble...</p><p class="double">His Renkell lurched, the left engine erupting in a ball of smoke and flame, and his speed dropped markedly. As he looked around frantically for the source of the damage, a second short burst of gunfire hit the right engine.</p><p class="double">“Damn it!” his accomplice Preuss said, from the rear seat. “Can we still fly?”</p><p class="double">“Not worth a damn,” he replied, snapping the cockpit levers open. “I&#039;m getting out of here.”</p><p class="double">Without a backward glance, he jumped.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Renkell scraped along the ground on its belly, though the fuel loss from bullet holes meant it didn&#039;t explode.</p><p class="double">“Did you see parachutes?” Scootaloo asked, circling and looking for a suitable landing strip. (The Clover was designed to land on a carrier, so it didn&#039;t have to be all that <i>big</i> a landing strip, but the grapevines below probably weren&#039;t adequate.)</p><p class="double">“One,” Nyx replied, looking herself. “It landed next to that villa.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the two pilots – one looking to be in her late thirties, though that was impossible given it was clearly WWI ace Sally Cooper, and another who appeared to be barely 18 – approached, Picard felt like kicking himself.</p><p class="double">These had to be the Loopers who had altered world history, and here he was having to explain to them why he&#039;d hit a man with a wrench.</p><p class="double">Well, he&#039;d just have to play it cool. After all, this German man had been threatening him with a gun. <i>Just think aggrieved Toulousain.</p><p class="double"></i><i><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“That man was very helpful,” Nyx said brightly. “It might have taken us weeks to catch Gontermann otherwise.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah...” Scootaloo agreed, pensively. “I still think there was something familiar about him from somewhere.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.5</p><p class="double">“MORTALS!” Nightmare Moon boomed. “The Night Will Last Forever... at the Lunar Resort! Yes, the Lunar Resort, where you&#039;ll feel eighty-three percent lighter!”</p><p class="double">The screaming started, then stopped in confusion after about a second.</p><p class="double">“Pardon?” Bon Bon said.</p><p class="double">“I am the owner and proprietor of the Lunar Resort. Featuring great views over the ocean – and the land, depending on what time of the day it is – the Lunar Resort has all modern conveniences.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s horn glowed, and two thousand brochures rained down on the startled crowd.</p><p class="double">“We have a golf course – hit a golf ball for miles! We have fitness equipment, vertical cliff climbing, automated wing sets for unicorns and earth ponies, a lunar swimming pool – dive for half a minute! And much more!”</p><p class="double">The dark alicorn cleared her throat, then spoke very quickly.</p><p class="double">“Typical cost for a fortnight at the Lunar Resort is in the vicinity of one thousand bits, terms and conditions apply. Management is not responsible for accidental loss of breathing caused by opening doors signposted as for staff only.”</p><p class="double">“So,” she went on, back to the normal voice. “Sign on for an out of this world experience! Book today and get a free cuddly toy!”</p><p class="double">She held one up. To a Looper, it would bear a certain resemblance to Nyx.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia looked up from the brochure. “...and this is what my sister did when she landed?”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much,” Twilight confirmed, hiding her amusement. “I&#039;ve booked already. I think you&#039;re right, I do need to make some friends, and unwinding with a holiday seems the perfect opportunity.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.6</p><p class="double">An alicorn with a mane of red-flecked pastel, an ominous ruddy glow emanating from her very skin and lighting her white coat and wings with deep red light, stalked onto the stage.</p><p class="double">“The Night Will Last Forever!” she announced, flaring her wings to knock the guards away.</p><p class="double">“Sister!” came a voice from the side of the stage. In a clatter of hooves, an alicorn of dark fur and plumage cantered into view. “Why must we begin this old conflict again anew?”</p><p class="double">“You did not respect my Night,” the first alicorn said, turning. “None of them did. They must be <i>made</i> to respect my Night, for it to get the admiration it-”</p><p class="double">“Wait a minute!” Twilight said bossily, trotting up the steps onto the planking of the stage itself. “I think there&#039;s been a mix-up.”</p><p class="double">“Are you sure?” the red-white alicorn said, turning to her and flourishing a piece of paper. “I checked my lines just five minutes ago.”</p><p class="double">Twilight took the paper. “Oh, I think I see. Luna? Can I have yours?”</p><p class="double">As the audience tried to work out what, precisely, was going on, the dark alicorn passed another sheet over.</p><p class="double">“Right, right.” Twilight swapped them over, then gave them back. “Simple mix-up.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, I see.” The two alicorns trotted off set.</p><p class="double">A second later, the dark alicorn stalked onto the stage with her mane glowing like the stars. “The Night Will Last Forever!”</p><p class="double">“Is this a joke?” someone asked from the back.</p><p class="double">“Silence!” the dark alicorn ordered. “It was a simple mix up, that is all!”</p><p class="double">“Is it my cue yet, Luna?” Celestia poked her head around the curtain, her mane still glowing red. “It&#039;ll take a moment more to get the makeup off...”</p><p class="double">“No, it is not your cue yet,” Luna said, sighing. “Right, this is a wash. Let&#039;s try Trottingham.”</p><p class="double">Two flashes of light, and they vanished.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.7</p><p class="double">“Okay, I&#039;ve asked everyone else...” Chrysalis said. “What&#039;s your mane aura?”</p><p class="double">Berry put her glass down carefully, and turned to Chrysalis. “No idea.”</p><p class="double">“...pardon?”</p><p class="double">“Look.” Berry picked her glass up again, and took a sip. “The whole ascension thing? Complete accident on my part. I wanted to have some glasses that Discord couldn&#039;t turn into kumquats, or whatever, so I got Twilight to make them out of that... cosmic...”</p><p class="double">“Cosmic Spectrum, I think,” Chrysalis supplied. “What the Crystal Heart&#039;s made of.”</p><p class="double">“Right!” Berry shrugged. “Apparently it causes ascensions. I did not know this, but Twilight assumed I did.”</p><p class="double">“I see.”</p><p class="double">The Changeling queen turned that over in her mind for a bit.</p><p class="double">“So you don&#039;t Ascend much?”</p><p class="double">“Hardly ever,” she confirmed. “Basically only when I&#039;m tasting a drink that would do a non-immortal serious damage. I know that the loop resets fix things, but I&#039;d rather not end up deaf in both ears for a few years.”</p><p class="double">Berry then reached behind the bar. “Speaking of... I made this for you.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked at the bottle dubiously. “What&#039;s it made of?”</p><p class="double">“Water,” Berry said with a virtuous nod. “Pure, distilled water.”</p><p class="double">“And that&#039;s dangerous?”</p><p class="double">“It is if you&#039;re running the still at twenty times normal speed...”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t particularly want to know.” Chrysalis pulled the cork out and poured herself some. “Well... thank you, I suppose.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, how did you do that?” Trixie asked, somewhat awed.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis snored the snore of the deeply sloshed.</p><p class="double">“Homeopathy,” Berry replied smugly. “I&#039;m thinking of marketing it as the healthiest drink you can get drunk with.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.8</p><p class="double">“Okay. Simple question.”</p><p class="double">“Shoot.”</p><p class="double">“Why are we horses?”</p><p class="double">“Actually, I think it&#039;s <i>ponies</i>,” Ranma corrected. “I&#039;ve been here before. Nice place.”</p><p class="double">Nabiki looked dubiously at her hooves. “Name one good reason.”</p><p class="double">“Well, here, the normal behaviour of two girls who have a crush on the same guy appears to be to talk it out with the guy.” The Anchor smiled wistfully. “Man, but that&#039;d be nice in our baseline.”</p><p class="double">“I wouldn&#039;t know, Saotome,” the mercenary Tendo snarked.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that reminds me,” Ranma added. “The rulers of this place consider it to be a sanctuary loop. No giant monsters.”</p><p class="double">“...that was just two times!”</p><p class="double">“I didn&#039;t need to see a giant robot crushing Candyland <i>once</i>.” Ranma rolled his eyes. “Right, let&#039;s see if the locals are Awake.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, I&#039;ve heard about you,” Rarity said, looking Nabiki up and down. “So, what&#039;s your local name?”</p><p class="double">Nabiki started to speak... and stopped. She whirled on one hoof to point at Ranma. “Why am I called Pound Foolish?”</p><p class="double">Ranma shrugged, hiding a snicker.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, at least you didn&#039;t do any <i>physical</i> damage,” Twilight said airily. “Not bad, for such an old and experienced looper on their first visit.”</p><p class="double">Nabiki winced.</p><p class="double">“I think it was the introduction of fractional reserve banking which did it,” the Tendo added. “Everything up until then was working perfectly.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a good thing we only tried it out in Ponyville...” Twilight shrugged. “The place is used to minor catastrophes, I think it&#039;s the Everfree forest.”</p><p class="double">&#039;Pound Foolish&#039; nodded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.9</p><p class="double">“This is gonna be <i>so awesome</i>,” Scootaloo grinned. For once, she&#039;d managed to persuade everypony to do air combat instead of naval. (It had taken some doing.)</p><p class="double">She pushed open the cockpit of the Spitfire Mk. 22, which had been produced (but not used) in the Hub world war two and was hence allowed.</p><p class="double">This was <i>her</i> speciality, and-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, what.”</p><p class="double">All four of the defeated fillies gave Silver Spoon identical black looks.</p><p class="double">“What?” the pegasus asked, flaring her wings in a shrug. “It was WW2, like you said.”</p><p class="double">“Enola Gay is cheating!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.10 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Blue fluffy unicorns, dancing on rainbows! Blue fluffy unicorns, dancing on- dancing on- rain-</p><p class="double"></i>Trixie came to an abrupt stop as she Woke up. Opening her eyes, she was faced with a bed-maned Chrysalis, calmly staring at her. The two of them stood there for a moment, before Trixie commented, &quot;Stop giving me that look, this isn&#039;t the worst thing you&#039;ve ever cought me doing.&quot;</p><p class="double">This did not however, have the intended reaction. Chrysalis&#039; eyes widened, and pointing a trembling hoof at Trixie, she squeaked out, &quot;Y-you can <i>talk?!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Thinking quickly, Trixie checked her loop memories for how Trixie Puff would deal with the situation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pffft.&quot; Now cheerfully blank faced, tongue sticking out, Trixie observed Chrysalis, gauging how effective her ruse was.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t. &quot;You don&#039;t believe Trixie for a moment, do you?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie had just finished explaining enough about the loops to a very confused unawake Chrysalis, and had re-introduced herself, complete with the little fireworks, when the Worst. Possible. Thing happened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you smell smoke? If Trixie set the library on fire, Twilight will- URGLBARGLE!&quot; Chrysalis cut Trixie off with the fire extinguisher.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why did you do that?! <i>How</i> did you do that?! Trixie Puff isn&#039;t allowed to play with fireworks! She always catches fire! Crap, are you still smoldering? You&#039;re still smoldering. Come on, we need to soak you to put out the embers!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>No fireworks? No fireworks?! This loop is hell.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.11 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Inside the Twi-brary (patent pending), Twilight stood before her fellow loopers, wearing drill sergeant shades and an army helmet, with black stripes painted under her eyes, and a cigar in her mouth (bubblegum, it was the only kind Pinkie had on her)</p><p class="double"> &quot;Okay troops. I think you all know why we&#039;re here. THIS.&quot; she declared, gesturing to the multi-locked box with a riding crop as Spike placed it on the table next to her. &quot;We have tried frankly a downright irresponsible number of things to get this open. Zecora, Mac, and Berry have tried everything from Zebrican acid potions, to Applejack&#039;s potato cider...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack shot her brother a dirty look. &quot;Ah swear! Ya mess up ONE time and ya never hear the end of it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applebloom tried military grade laser cutters...&quot;</p><p class="double">The filly in question looked up from her micro-welding and gave a shrug. &quot;So ah forgot that the box has a mirror finish. Could have happened to anyone.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The entire CMC tried taking it with them while crusading...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll admit, I was a bit shocked it didn&#039;t work.&quot; Nyx sighed.</p><p class="double"> Scootaloo nodded. &quot;Yeah, it just wound up getting sticky...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie tried just plain cheating...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Those lockpicks were planted on me I tell you!&quot; the party pony insisted. Though the old fashioned museum robber outfit she was wearing cost her a bit of credibility.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweetie tried... wubs...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That canon of Vinyl&#039;s takes things apart at a sub-atomic level! It should have worked!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think we all KNOW what Trixie tried...&quot; Twilight continued, giving the showmare a sharp glare.</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie has not failed, she has merely found a level of explosives that is insufficient! Now somepony uncuff Trixie!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis wiggled her eyebrows. &quot;Must I?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... Trixie will allow you to release her later.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, moving swiftly along. Fluttershy tried... asking nicely... I&#039;m STILL not sure how that got four of the locks to open, but whatever.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was only polite, and if the box isn&#039;t ready to open up to others, it&#039;s not my place to force it.&quot; Fluttershy commented as she finished setting up her therapy couch for her plans this loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Angel tried... something. That&#039;s all I&#039;m saying on the matter. And I tried friendship beaming it. Both the Equestrian, AND the Nanoha kinds. Rainbow Dash, it&#039;s your turn, but after all that, don&#039;t get your hopes up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow dash took the box and gave a wing salute and a grin. &quot;Not to worry Twi, I got us a good one. We&#039;ve just been using the wrong tactics. We&#039;ve been TRYING to open it. I&#039;m gonna&#039; try opening it by... accident.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned. &quot;Enlighten me then, how do you plan to do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh... I have my ways.&quot; Rainbow Dash chuckled, looking out the window at the passing local wall-eyed mail-mare with a smirk. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.12 (Goldude)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Focus, Casanova. What&#039;s next on the list?&quot; Twilight asked. Since Chrysalis was really the only one awake this loop, she decided to go baseline for now. She had a plan to integrate The Changelings that felt like it was going to be fun.</p><p class="double">Spike cleared his throat and fished for the checklist for The Summer Sun Celebration preparations. &quot;Oh, uh... Music! That&#039;s the last one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. Then heard the all-too-familiar chirping of Fluttershy&#039;s birds. The purple pony closed her eyes and smiled, listening intently. What came next, she did not expect at all.</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on, sing it with me! ♪You and me, baby, we ain&#039;t nothing but animals, so let&#039;s do it like they do on the Discovery Channel!♪&quot; She could practically hear the record scratch in her own mind. Her eyes opened and smile faded as the animals actually started to sing in tune with this strange newcomer.</p><p class="double">From what she could see, there was no Fluttershy. It was instead a yellow stallion pegasus with a short, brown mane that curled up in the front. He was also wearing a gaudy Hawaiian shirt and grinning proudly. Twilight boggled a moment as the song went on before rushing up to the new pony. &quot;You&#039;re not Fluttershy!&quot;</p><p class="double">Just like that, the strange pony whipped his head to face her. He then looked up and down her, as if judging her. &quot;...Well, hello there, B-E-A-eutiful!&quot; He paused as he struck an exaggerated thinking pose. &quot;My... memories tell me that I am to prepare for the 1000th Summer Sun Celebration. You shouldn&#039;t worry your pretty little head off, sparklebutt. I&#039;ve got things well in hand.&quot;</p><p class="double">This stallion&#039;s presence was somehow throwing her off. It&#039;s like he held an exuberant enthusiasm for animals. Twilight really couldn&#039;t understand why, and shook her head to try and clear her thoughts and compose herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;A- Anyway... I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle, the Anchor for this universe.&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion&#039;s eyebrow raised as Twilight held her hoof out for a hoofshake. &quot;Oh? ...How pleasant.&quot; He grasped Twilight&#039;s hoof delicately and kissed it gently, giving her a winning grin. &quot;Name&#039;s Ace Vet. Or Ace Ventura. Whichever works. But you can call me &#039;The Master Mater.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight could <i>feel</i> her cheeks blush. She tried to say something, but the words were caught up in her mouth. All that escaped was the sound of a chicken crossed with a dying sheep being put through a blender.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, yes, I <i>do</i> have that kind of affect on the ladies!&quot; Ace Ventura exclaimed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;A Manticore!&quot; It roared. Twilight wondered how exactly Ace Ventura would tackle this challenge. &quot;We&#039;ve gotta get past it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Without hesitation, the manticore leaped and swiped at Rarity. She dodged it. She always dodged it. She retaliated in kind with a strong buck to the face, sending it staggering back. She was then promptly tackled by Ace Ventura. &quot;What are you <i>doing</i>, you vile, vile <i>witch</i>!&quot; The last word was punctuated by a strong hoofslap across the face. Rarity tossed the crazy pony off of her.</p><p class="double">Ace righted himself and stood up, beginning a rant. &quot;Do you realize what that poor creature is? It&#039;s an ANIMAL. That means we don&#039;t hurt it! In fact, it&#039;s already hurt.&quot; He stood up straighter and gained a confident smile. &quot;Allow me to handle this, ladies. Especially you, My Little Sparkle!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy&#039;s replacement then whipped himself around to face the manticore and got close to the ground, his teeth chattering as if he was a chipmunk. He jumpily looked around, teeth still chattering as he inched his way forward to the manticore. He paused once or twice to have a little grass nibble.</p><p class="double">The manticore was cautious, as usual, as Ace got closer and closer. The rest of the girls looked at Ace as if he grew two heads, but none were able to form the words to caution him away from the manticore. When Ace got close enough, he started nuzzling it, eventually reaching the injured paw. And, as usual, it showed the source of its ailment, the thorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my god... you poor, poor baby...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Baby?&quot; Rainbow Dash was incredulous at what was going on in front of her.</p><p class="double">Ventura, however, continued to offer babytalking words of reassurance and encouragement. He massaged the back of the manticore&#039;s paw, and soon enough, was able to get the thorn out, pain free. When the manticore noticed, it scooped up Ace and began licking him. He returned the favor by licking the manticore back.</p><p class="double">Applejack boggled at what she saw. &quot;...What in tarnation did we just see?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed a little. Even she didn&#039;t expect any of this. &quot;Sometimes a little kindness goes a long way.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity frowned. &quot;It&#039;s a shame, darling, you having only two gala tickets.&quot; She sidled up next to Ace Ventura, gripping a leg with hers. &quot;If you had more, Ace and I could&#039;ve accompanied you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ace rolled his eyes and pulled away from Rarity. &quot;As if.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked. &quot;Why, whatever do you mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">The new Element of Kindness turned to face Rarity. &quot;Let&#039;s face it: Twilight Sparkle and I are nothing but animals!&quot; He paused to give Twilight a lecherous grin while the Anchor choked on her words and looked away. &quot;Besides, whitey-tighty, you don&#039;t have her perfect girlish figure.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity balked. &quot;...Are you saying I&#039;m <i>fat</i>?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like a whale.&quot; Rarity&#039;s face blushed red and contorted in rage. Ten minutes later, he and Twilight were hiding in Rainbow Dash&#039;s house.</p><p class="double">She considered sending Ace to the moon. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">55.13 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie bounced down the Ponyville street in her usual merry manner. Since the current Loop seemed to be baseline except for a slightly higher background magic level, and since the previous Loop had been a bit exhausting (note: the power of friendship can cure some, but not all, victims of a plague-based zombie apocalypse), and since the Princesses weren&#039;t Awake, the Elements had agreed to let things play out to baseline this Loop. Twilight was due in town any minute to oversee the Summer Sun Celebration preparations, and Pinkie was casually perambulating where she could see her for the &quot;first&quot; time and do her gasp of shock.</p><p class="double">Pinkie was proud of her new &quot;gasp of shock&quot; routine. She&#039;d been working on it for thirty-seven loops in private, waiting for a baseline run. If she could get Twilight to break baseline, Pinkie would count that as a victory.</p><p class="double">Wondering what she would demand as a victory prize, Pinkie didn&#039;t notice the strange stallion in pyjamas and a somewhat ratty looking bath robe until she bounced right into him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oof! Excuse me!&quot; the stallion said in a light Trottingham accent.</p><p class="double">Pinkie looked at him. She was absolutely, positively certain that, out of all the Loops she&#039;d been Awake for, she had never, ever, ever seen this pony before.</p><p class="double">Well, even if it meant spoiling the surprise for Twilight, there was only one thing to do.</p><p class="double">The stallion stared in shock and terror as Pinkie&#039;s dramatic gasp went on for a good forty-two seconds. During that time her color went from pink through every color in the rainbow, including a strangely intelligent-looking shade of fluorescent blue. Her morphic field fluctuated, causing her to shape-shift mid-gasp through three other generations of pony, pegasus, alicorn, human, chaos god, elder god, whale, bowl of petunias, and teapot, before returning to her preferred shade and shape.</p><p class="double">And then she said, &quot;Hello!&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion, after several seconds of gibbering, managed to say, &quot;H-h-hello. I, um... I beg your pardon, but does the name &#039;Agrajag&#039; mean anything to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Pinkie Pie said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank God for that,&quot; the stallion said, sitting down hard on the hard-packed dirt street.</p><p class="double">&quot;You must be a new Looper!&quot; Pinkie beamed. &quot;I&#039;ve never met you before anywhere ever, any Loop ever, so I need to throw you a Welcome-to-Equestria party!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no,&quot; the stallion shook his head vigorously. &quot;No, no, no, no, no. No parties. There is not time for a party. This is not a time for a party. The words party and time do not belong together in any imaginable sentence, under the current circumstances, except for sentences that indicate that the words party and time do not belong together in sentences.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, come now,&quot; Pinkie giggled. &quot;It&#039;s always time for a party?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Even when something truly horrible and destructive is about to happen?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really? What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know,&quot; the stallion said. &quot;But I&#039;ve been bounced from planet to planet, century to century, universe to universe, and Loop to Loop for thousands of Loops now. And just when I think things are calm and I can relax, wham bang, something horrible always happens to me! The entire multiverse of all things imaginable is out to get me!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie put a forehoof on the trembling stallion&#039;s shoulder. &quot;Look, buddy, don&#039;t worry. This is Equestria. We&#039;re a sanctuary Loop. We won&#039;t let anything bad happen to you, ever.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve heard that before,&quot; the stallion moaned wretchedly. &quot;Usually just before the person saying it does something horrible.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie frowned. This pony was proving to be a real downer. If she couldn&#039;t cheer him up, then maybe it was time for more direct help. &quot;Look, my Anchor&#039;s going to be here in a few minutes,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#039;ll talk to her, and maybe she can come up with something, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight remembered the primitive scanning devices of her baseline, with the blinky-light colander and printed readouts and all. She snorted derisively at baseline-Twilight&#039;s old concept of high technology and science. Such things were nothing compared to the holographic full-immersion multi-scan systems she&#039;d assembled, mostly from a trip to the Tenchi Loop. The stallion sat in the middle of the hovering screens and colorful three-dimensional analytic readouts, in obvious awe (and bewilderment) at the capital-S Science Twilight had at her disposal.</p><p class="double">Of course, there was a thing on his head with blinking multicolored lights on it, because if you&#039;re not going to have blinky lights, why bother?</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m amazed,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I&#039;ve never seen a more perfect weave of the Interesting Times Curse and the Never Know Happiness Curse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Say, Twilight,&quot; Pinkie grinned, &quot;remember when you said curses didn&#039;t exist?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not now, Pinkie,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;This is a truly fascinating case. And these curses are so powerful and intricate! I&#039;m so glad I can document all this for future study! I&#039;ll need a hundred Loops just to understand all the fine points of the design!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But can you do something about it?&quot; the stallion asked. &quot;Can you actually make all the horrible things stop happening?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I can&#039;t make all the horribleness stop,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;You&#039;re a Looper, and an Anchor too I&#039;m guessing. You&#039;re going to have bad Loops just like the rest of us. But I think I can break the curse... if I have enough time.&quot; She looked at the stallion, who reminded him a bit of Rincewind. He&#039;d shown up one Loop as a reddish unicorn with a scraggly beard and a weatherbeaten hat with &quot;Wizzard&quot; in places-where-sequins-used-to-be written on it. That notable had spent his entire Sanctuary loop in the Library under a bookshelf, stepping foot outside only to go to the market to buy potatoes.</p><p class="double">&quot;How much time do you think I have?&quot; the stallion asked.</p><p class="double">The moment he asked it Twilight&#039;s scanners went wild. An instant later the light coming in through the basement windows dimmed, and the wind howled outside the tree. A few moments later a loud, echoing voice filled the air:</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;ATTENTION, BEINGS OF EQUESTRIA.

The voice of the Vogon commander could be heard saying one last thing on the still-live mike: &quot;BLOODY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, IT&#039;LL BE THE-&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the skies were clear, birds chirping, and ponies jubilant.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The library door opened, and Twilight led Pinkie Pie and Tea Thirst, nee Dent, out into the sunlight. &quot;I can&#039;t guarantee the curse will remain gone,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Yggdrasil might restore the status on your next Loop. But there are other Loopers who specialize in purifying curses. Keep an eye out for them. And in the meantime, enjoy the next four years or-&quot;</p><p class="double">She froze.</p><p class="double">“Wait a minute. Who handled the thing with the Vogons?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie screwed her face up. “I think it might have been Ivory Scroll!

And since I was going back in time, I decided to go back an extra few minutes to give you that talk.”</p><p class="double">“I have to say...” Ivory said absently, “when you said that that pendant would make me a whole new pony, I didn&#039;t quite expect this...”</p><p class="double">“I was in kind of a hurry, sorry.” Twilight winced. “You don&#039;t have to use it again, Berry doesn&#039;t much, but the option is there.”</p><p class="double">Twilight left the mayor to the admiring crowd and walked back over to Pinkie and Tea Thirst. &quot;All right,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#039;ve taken care of everything now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tea Thirst looked into the middle distance a moment. “Ah, right. I see.”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled and asked eagerly, &quot;You do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No,&quot; Tea Thirst admitted with a sigh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Sorry about that. I should have said, I had some business to take care of in the past.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, time travel,&quot; Tea Thirst said. &quot;Now I understand. I hate when it happens to me.

Time to troll the Cloudsdale team.</p><p class="double">Spitfire spoke frst. &quot;Rainbow Dash, you got a minute?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, sure.&quot; Happy but slightly confused, that was the way to act. </p><p class="double">&quot;You could really be an asset to our team, so... we want you to join the Cloudsdale team. Permanently.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash gasped, as she usually did, though the first time it had been in shock at the yellow dog offer.</p><p class="double">&quot;It looks like Soarin&#039;s wing won&#039;t heal in time for the trials. We want you to fly with us.&quot; Spitfire started the play and Fleetfoot continued the double team. &quot;Of course, this means you won&#039;t be able to fly for Ponyville, but let&#039;s face it. Even with you on their team, their chances of qualifying for the Games are – pretty slim. </p><p class="double">&quot;So, what&#039;s it gonna be?&quot; Spitfire asked.</p><p class="double">Dash forced down her disgust at the way her one time idol was acting, though she could let at least some of it through to set up for the punch line. </p><p class="double">&quot;Abandon my team? Have you been flying too high? Element of Loyalty here! As if I would ever... oh, heh heh, good one. This is one of those &#039;secret test of character things&#039; isn&#039;t it? I mean there&#039;s no way Spitfire, Leader of the Wonderbolts, epitome of everything a pegasus aspires to be would make such an offer for real. You&#039;d be abandoning one of your own team mates like a used cloud and wrecking the chances of another team just to marginally improve the chances of what&#039;s already pretty much a sure thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash shook her head. &quot;I mean, you had me going there for a moment, but after what you said to me at the Wonderbolt Academy about &#039;pushing yourself in the right direction&#039;, that beating everyone no matter who got hurt and winning at all costs was not the Wonderbolt way, you&#039;d have to be a massive hypocrite to then turn around and do exactly that. And pulling it on me of all ponies, the Element of Loyalty? You&#039;d have to be... what was that thing Twilight said yesterday before she&#039;d had her coffee? &#039;displaying a level of ineptitude that borders on the imbecilic.&#039; Yeah, that was it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not even a brain damaged diamond dog would pull such a stupid stunt, let alone someone like you.&quot; Dash grinned. &quot;Don&#039;t worry, I won&#039;t let you down, or my own team. I will continue to uphold the ideals of the Wonderbolts, even if I&#039;m flying against you guys. Cloudberries, I can&#039;t believe I ever thought for a moment that you&#039;d try such a despicable tactic! I must be the one flying too high! Anyway, gotta go! I hope we can still train together, after all, you guys push me further than I could go alone, and anything that makes me better helps my team. See ya!&quot;</p><p class="double">She walked away, not bothering to hide the smirk.

Her eye however was drawn to a rather large and well-made painting depicting what was obviously (to her, despite the poor facial quality) the extended Cutie Mark Crusaders in human form, dressed in finery, military regalia or mechanic&#039;s overalls, and standing dwarfed in front of the daunting forms of half a dozen flying craft she managed to piece out as jet planes and fighters.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you like it? It&#039;s one of my most prized possessions.&quot; Diamond said as she entered the room, her trusty butler leaving to attend other business.</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. &quot;Well, I can see it&#039;s a very fine painting, but you&#039;ve surely got other pictures of all of you together, why is this one so much more precious?&quot; she asked, curious.</p><p class="double">Diamond answered by pointing down to the signature at the painting&#039;s corner, causing Twilight&#039;s eyes to widen comically. &quot;Ah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It was actually not that difficult to commission, all things considered. Bit of a bother keeping it, but the pocket was deposit-only that loop so that helped. Anyway, where were we?

<p>56.1 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">It had been years since Twilight last woke Celestia up in the middle of the night. While it had tapered off in the time leading up to Twilight&#039;s move to Ponyville, Luna&#039;s occasional midnight wake-up calls had taken their place in recent months.</p><p class="double">Thus, Celestia was understandably confused by the purple mare waking her up at four thirty nine AM, surrounded by the other bearers, wearing black bodysuits.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Please wake up! Princess? You&#039;re awake!&quot; Twilight said, withdrawing the hoof she had been shaking her with. &quot;I&#039;m so sorry for waking you like this, but we need your help.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s wrong Twilight? What time is it, anyway?&quot; Celestia asked, coming more aware, as Twilight pulled a notepad from her bag.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll have to be fast about this, we&#039;re actually in a strange Heartsong intermission. It&#039;s what we somehow used to infiltrate the castle without being seen.&quot; She replied, flipping to the desired page in her notepad. The Princess saw the signs of Twilight preparing an explanation, as she finished crawling from bed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Six days ago, I was visited by my future self, who had travelled back in time to tell me how to save Equestria. So far, everything&#039;s been going according to the plan she wrote out for me, right down to accurately predicting the Heartsong.</p><p class="double">&quot;Step two hundred eighty nine: Short Explanation to Princess Celestia, check. Step two hundred ninety: Give Princess Celestia sneaky stealth suit, check?&quot; Twilight gave her a questioning look, another black bodysuit being pulled from her bag.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well, Twilight,&quot; Celestia sighed, &quot;But I expect a full explanation, once this matter is concluded.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As the seven sneaky stealth suited ponies stepped from Celestia&#039;s doors, the Princess couldn&#039;t help but ask, &quot;Did you have to knock out my guards, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m really, really sorry Princess, but Future Twilight was very serious about us not being seen until we got the Elements out of the castle. She underlined that step three times! They&#039;ll be fine! Really!&quot; Came the nervous reply.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... see. And how are we to get halfway across the castle without being seen? There are a great many guards along the path.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Heartsong!&quot; Twilight eagerly replied, citing her notepad. &quot;Step Two hundred ninety one, continue previous Heartsong to Elements, and out of the castle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Celestia grinned, &quot;It has been some time since I was last part of a Heartsong. Ah! There it goes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sure enough, the sound of trumpets started sounding all around them, the seven ponies started taking dramatic poses to the punctuation of the music.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;With cat like tread! Upon our prey we steal!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">The ponies were already halfway down the hallway.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;In silence dread! Our cautious way we feel!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">They were almost to the stairs.</p><p class="double"><i><b>&quot;NO SOUND AT ALL!&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">The entire castle seemed to shake, as all the standing guards bellowed out the last line, with an underscore of the Royal Canterlot Voice echoing from elsewhere in the castle.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;We never speak a word!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">This was blatantly untrue.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;A fly&#039;s foot-fall, would be distinctly heard...</i></p><p><i>So stealthily the ponies creep while all the castle soundly sleeps.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">They were anything but stealthy, and yet the guards didn&#039;t react at all as they went by, in plain sight.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Come, friends, who bear Harmony!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">They were on the right floor now.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Trust to Luna&#039;s singing!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">It occurs to Celestia, that the guards might not be reacting to them due to the narrative causality of the Heartsong.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Though she sets our ears to ringing!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">She&#039;d have to look into that later.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Let&#039;s vary world-saving,</i></p><p><i>With a little burglering!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Elements secured, and sent away aboard a pre-dawn train, a bemused Princess Celestia strode into the throne room. While she was able to keep her reaction to the guard&#039;s looks hidden, the way Luna boggled at the bodysuit she wore tested that control.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good morning Luna, I&#039;ve had an interesting time this past hour. Guardspony, go wake Captain Armor, we have a situation.</p><p class="double">&quot;I just helped Twilight continue a stable time loop, that required I send her and the other Bearers off to parts unknown with the Elements. I&#039;m sure they can handle the situation, but I dislike not knowing what I&#039;ve sent them to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And since thou were not to go with them, any actions we take from here would logically be part of the loop, including trying to find out what their mission is, and what we might do to aid it.&quot; Luna finished her sister&#039;s thoughts.</p><p class="double">It would be several fruitless hours of searching before news of the Crystal Empire&#039;s return reached them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sat in a room with her friends, in the Crystal Castle. They had shown up, saved the mysterious city-state, failed to blast the badguy with the Elements, then succeeded to blast him with the Crystal Heart... which they did by blasting it with the Elements.</p><p>Now though, she was trying to find where Future Twilight wrote how to convince the crystal ponies to not crown her their queen-protector, and not hurt their feelings in the process. Sadly, the notepad had no answers for her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why didn&#039;t Future Twilight mention this? Maybe she hasn&#039;t figured it out yet, and I loop sometime soon? But where do I find the spell? Is it somewhere in the city? I&#039;m too young to be a queen-&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stopped mid-panic as she Woke up. Blinking, she checked her loop memories. Little hints told her the others were Awake, and a big hint from Pinkie in the form of the Gilbert and Sullivan Heartsongs.</p><p class="double">She looked up at her friends, and asked: &quot;Did I just <i>prank myself?&quot;</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.2 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double">Twilight came Awake in her usual spot over the book describing the rise of... Bad Horse? That was a new one. A little on the nose, even by pony name standards.</p><p class="double">She was about to reread the passage to double check for other inconsistencies with the baseline when the familiar rumble from her assistant signalled an incoming letter. In a moment he&#039;d unrolled the scroll and was about to read when music filtered in from the edge of hearing.</p><p class="double">Three ponies in cowpony gear suddenly appeared beside her, bouncing gently in time to the tune, and sang out.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Sun Mare, Sun Mare,</p><p>She&#039;s good, Sun Mare!</p><p class="double">Oh, She raises moon and sun</p><p>At dusk and dawn each day!</p><p>She got the station-</p><p>-ary that you sent her way!</p><p>In answer she has one,</p><p>Yes just one thing to say:</p><p class="double">Your lonely studies have to end,</p><p>So off to Ponyville, make some friends!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">The trio of ponies vanished just as quickly as they&#039;d arrived and Twilight blinked slowly as she absorbed what had just happened.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, one: Apparently heart songs can be induced via postage,&quot; she said to herself, already wondering how one might accomplish such a thing. &quot;And two: Was one of them Applejack?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.3 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot; Pinkie Pie had an uncharacteristic expression of concern.</p><p class="double">&quot;What&#039;s up, Pinkie?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember when we assumed this was a baseline Loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeeeees...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... you better come see this.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. She, Pinkie, and Sweetie Belle were the only ones Awake this Loop. That meant fewer eyes to find potential bugs in the baseline that might need to be dealt with. Her experiments would have to be postponed until the next half-moon. She turned off the gas stove, carefully unwound the bungee cords, and informed the chicken that it could return to Fluttershy&#039;s house.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, can you tell me what this is all about?&quot; she asked as she and Pinkie walked to Sugarcube Corner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... no, I really better not. It&#039;s something you just can&#039;t believe until you see it.&quot; Pinkie frowned and added, &quot;I&#039;ve been dealing with it for a week, but it&#039;s beginning to creep me out.&quot;</p><p class="double">When they arrived, Twilight understood Pinkie&#039;s reluctance. Could she have imagined that malevolent black face without the blade-like red horn? Could she have believed it, without actually staring into those flaming eyes... those eyes that, for whatever reason, kept pointing in different directions?</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;MUFFINS,&quot;</b> the earth pony hissed as they walked past.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just keep walking,&quot; Pinkie Pie hissed, leading Twilight behind the counter and towards the kitchen.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;MUFFINS,&quot;</b> the earth pony repeated. After the mares had left the room, he leaned over the counter and added plaintively, <b>&quot;Aw, c&#039;mon... muffins...&quot;</b></p><p class="double"><b><hr></b></p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s prediction that the altered Sombra was an amusing but harmless glitch in an otherwise baseline Loop was proven wrong not quite two years later, when the Crystal Empire suddenly reappeared after its thousand-year exile... in the middle of the Appleoosan desert.</p><p class="double">And an eldritch voice echoed through the canyons and over the mesas, saying, <i>&quot;I just don&#039;t know what went wrong...&quot;</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.4 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia stretched her back after getting off her throne. It was gradually getting easier to move around without assistance after spending so long attached to that chair. She managed to make her way to through the doorway and into the vast dinner hall that now served as a conference table. </p><p class="double">Even after her many loops, she still found it a novel experience to be human. Leman Russ, his two faithful talkative wolves, and his adopted mother, Fluttershy, sat at her side. </p><p class="double">And there was Pinkie Pie, once again the chaos goddess of joy and celebration. With her near infinite power, she was now taking the grinning form of Pinkie Pie, equestrian earth pony, and looking utterly and almost hilariously out of place.</p><p class="double">However, across the table, sat her genetically engineered sister. Luna Lupercal Horus, leader of the Luna&#039;s Night Wolves Legion, once traitor to the empire; was newly reformed from being scattered into the warp. Reformed, she claimed, in both meanings of the word, mostly thanks to the efforts of Twilight and her adepta sororoitas.</p><p class="double">It was an uneasy truce and the tension in the room was palpable.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s begin with something we can all agree upon,&quot; Celestia, God Empress of Mankind, smiled diplomatically, &quot;How about some cake?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.5 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Twilight was the only Element Awake again, though she&#039;d cottoned onto some clues that indicated either Luna, Nyx, or both were Awake and planning another Nightmare Moon prank, and going about her duties as the Summer Sun coordinator. Everything had been going according to the baseline so far and she was on her way to Fluttershy&#039;s as usual.</p><p class="double">But when she got there, her brain locked up at what she saw.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy wasn&#039;t training birds to sing this Loop. No, she was training... Twilight had no idea what those creatures were, but they looked like someone had cross-bred a bat with a helicopter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh!&quot; Fluttershy whispered in surprise. &quot;I didn&#039;t see you there. Are you the Summer Sun coordinator?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I...&quot; Twilight responded automatically before her curiosity reasserted itself and <i>demanded</i> to know what the heck was going on. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, but... what exactly are these critters you&#039;re training?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ve never seen a heyleut before?&quot; Fluttershy blinked in surprise. &quot;That&#039;s rather surprising given that they&#039;re one of the most popular pets in all Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Twilight attempted to process that, the local version of Angel Bunny zoomed up on his wheel-like limbs and skidded to a stop next to Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Yep, it looked like it was going to be one of <i>those</i> Loops. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.6 (Lord of Bones)</p><p class="double">Klauthiartrysx, the Bloody Star, the Red Dragon of the Mountain, opened his eyelid slightly and resisted the urge to groan out loud at the sight of yet another annoying pony out to spoil his nap. His ominous growl shook the loose rocks of his lair, and the malevolent red glow of his mouth warned the approaching lesser being about the consequences of annoying one of the First and the Last. </p><p class="double">The pony, a lavender-furred unicorn, simply smiled winningly and levitated what appeared to be a few brochures and assorted documents up to the wyrm&#039;s face. &quot;Good afternoon, Mr. Klauthiartrysx! My name is Twilight Sparkle, and I&#039;m representing Plots and Plans, Equestria&#039;s leading real estate developer, and the Royal Canterlot Moving Agency. We are fully prepared to reimburse you for the full cost of your current dwelling and set you up with a new one. Our brochures have both Standard and Deluxe options available for your perusal, and don&#039;t worry about the price!&quot;</p><p class="double">His curiosity piqued, the incredulous dragon unfolded the brochure and decided to humor the mad pony. A scaly eyeridge rose at the selection of caves, ruins, abandoned fortresses and hidden temple lairs on offer; many of them looked much more appealing than his current home. &quot;State of the art security, lava rivers, automatic gem sorter, mannequins, trick hoard...hang on, who&#039;s this?&quot; </p><p class="double">He pointed at one of the photographs, where a rather pretty dragoness was sunning herself on a cliff. The lavender unicorn peeked at the picture, and beamed. &quot;That&#039;s one of your possible new neigbours, of course! And you&#039;re in luck, we have one last Super-Deluxe package available, and if you take it she&#039;ll be your next-mountain neighbor!&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;How much?&quot; </p><p class="double">The unicorn smiled. It was not a nice smile. &quot;All expenses are paid for by the Crown of Canterlot. Please, sign here.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Smiling, Celestia unfurled the Friendship Report. &quot;Dear Princess Celestia....dragon has left...found a new home...please find enclosed bill for moving fee and Super Deluxe Lair Package?

She was named Rapinzel. She was human, and she only had access to a trickle of her normal power levels. She tried levitating the brush and pot she held, and judged her power level as equivalent to a filly&#039;s.</p><p class="double">She and Luna... Lovelace, who was down below, working on a loom to make some silvery material, had lived their entire lives in this tower, cared for by their mother, Gethel. Apparently the world outside was far too dangerous for innocent, fragile girls such as themselves. She would be coveted and a prize for the many evil people because her long blonde mane - hair - had the power of healing any injury when she sang a song. Said long blonde hair was very long, as it lost its power when cut. Lovelace would have her own problems as her midnight blue skin and blue hair would make people think she was a demon, not to mention the blemish on her forehead. She was far better off using her special ability which was to gather moonlight into thread and spun cloth which helped to support the three of them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna... I mean Lovelace. Are you thinking what I am?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Indeed.&quot; Luna stopped weaving and spun to face her sibling. &quot;Now I am Awake, Mother Gethel&#039;s story doth smell greatly of cheese. Our home is more of a gilded cage than a sanctuary, and gilded mostly by our own efforts at that.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia descended, in-loop reflexes causing her to automatically flip a length of her hair over a support beam to slide down. &quot;Unfortunately, from my memories, Gethel is a powerful spellcaster, and I find myself with only the smallest scrap of power. If we forced the issue, I don&#039;t think I could stand up to her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna frowned in concentration and then in frustration as a shimmering wavery bolt of silver energy formed in front of her, then poofed out of existence. &quot;Myself also. Tis infuriating! Cans&#039;t sense the greater part of mine own power, but hath separated from it, unable to use more than a mote.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia noted Luna&#039;s reversion to high-speak, a sure sign she was getting stressed. She focussed what power she had into shifting to mage sight, fortunately something that required more knowledge than power. She examined both herself and then Luna. &quot;Interesting... I am truly human, but my hair is almost a separate entity, and one that is associated with the sun. It is diverting my alicorn powers, making them a part of it&#039;s own. You on the other hand are an equine, transformed to human form. I&#039;m fairly certain that in-loop you were a unicorn and someone had managed to steal away your horn...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And now we do know how the crone comes by her powers.&quot; Luna growled. &quot;But she carries no staff or wand that might hide it. Mayhap she has engaged in binding rituals so that she might call on it&#039;s power remotely, which would&#039;st mean it could be anywhere!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia mused, thinking it through. &quot;If we could move around, and pooled what power we had, we might be able to do some divinations and try to triangulate on the source. But we&#039;d need maps, tools, things I can&#039;t make out of what we have in the tower. I also want to find out what those light are that appear every year on my birthday. I feel they&#039;re somehow connected with my in-loop origins. At the very least I don&#039;t think they&#039;re natural, so we may find people and some of the things we need.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We shall need time, also.&quot; Luna added. &quot;Gethel shalt hound us as soon as she finds out we are gone.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I know!&quot; Celestia exclaimed brightly. &quot;I&#039;ll ask for some of that white seashell paint as my birthday present. It&#039;ll take her three days to go and fetch some. I was going to ask to be let out, but we know why that won&#039;t happen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tis a cunning strategem!&quot; Luna was equally pleased. &quot;We shall away to see the lights, and find my horn. With it we can defy Gethel and free ourselves of her bondage!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two sisters made a fist and hoof-bumped. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.8 (54.3 continued) (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">The town of Zumzum wasn&#039;t the center or heart or gateway of anything. It had no great opera houses, no magnificent palaces, no historic monuments, and not all that much of anything to do on a Saturday night. It was just a town, an outpost of civilization surrounded by mostly uninhabited forest. (That is, uninhabited except for monsters and bandits, neither of whom appeared on the census rolls, which demonstrates a tragic lack of any sense of civic obligation on their part.)</p><p class="double">Thus it was the perfect place for a traveling circus and medicine show to set up... with a few drawbacks. The most notable drawback lay in the town&#039;s antiquated laws about travelling players, requiring them to camp either outside of the town walls or in the town square- no use of other facilities allowed. Since the gates shut at sundown, and thus cut off the paying audience, this left Von Payne&#039;s Sparkle Show with no real option but to park their wagons and set up their tents and stage in the town square.</p><p class="double">Next to the gallows.</p><p class="double">Which, as it turned out, was occupied.</p><p class="double">&quot;We can&#039;t perform HERE!&quot; Trixie shouted when she saw the arrangements. &quot;Performing next to corpses is disrespectful- and unhygenic!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Vell, if dot&#039;s a problem, we-uns got y&#039;all covered!&quot; one of the dangling bodies replied in a cheerful voice that, unfortunately, possessed a train wreck of two entirely incompatible accents.</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT?&quot; Trixie shrieked. &quot;You&#039;re still ALIVE??&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yah, vell,&quot; another of the bodies chimed in, &quot;Jagers, hyu know? Ve bin here two dayz zo far. Been pretty peaceful.&quot; She tried to nod her head, but the noose and gravity converted it into a full-body sway.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, you&#039;ll knock off mein hat!&quot; the third one said. &quot;Can&#039;t hyu hold schtill?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, walking with one of the other actresses, noticed the movement from the gallows, where two of the jagers were trying to kick each other with their bound feet while the third shook her head and rolled her eyes. The voices sounded familiar... and thankfully jagermonsters weren&#039;t limited in skin and hair color to the usual human palette, so she had more hints. The one with the cavalry hat had orange-ish skin and hair that split the difference between pink and purple. The one about to lose her fez had white hair and gray skin, with a pair of enormous glasses covering her eyes. Finally the one shaking her head, though an old helmet and goggles covered most of her hair, could be identified by the big red bow tied around the helmet&#039;s cockade.</p><p class="double">And, since Twilight hadn&#039;t bothered to crop her own distinctive purple hair, she found she also was distinctly recognizable.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twilight! We was wonderin&#039; when hyu vould show up!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I beg your pardon... ladies...&quot; The Loops had given Twilight plenty of time to learn how to act... and also how to lie, which are two different things. &quot;I am Madame Olga, soothsayer extraordinary.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, c&#039;mon, Twilight, ve&#039;re all Awake,&quot; the jager in the cavalry hat whined. &quot;Hyu don&#039;t haveta pretend-&quot;</p><p class="double">Through an impressive exhibition of gymnastics for someone who&#039;s bound hand and foot and hanging by their neck from a noose, the helmeted jager managed to use her feet to smack the orange jager on the head. &quot;If&#039;n she says she&#039;s not named Twilight, we DON&#039;T CALL HER TWILIGHT. Savvy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You forgot your accent,&quot; the orange jager whispered, shaking her head in a vain effort to de-smush her hat.</p><p class="double">Twilight suppressed a groan. Despite all the Loops, and all their talents, those two were definitely two-thirds of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and they still had their moments of what could only be called anti-genius. Best to stop this quickly. &quot;Madame Olga feels a vision coming upon her!&quot; she cried, pressing the back of her hand to her forehead in a suitably dramatic fashion. &quot;I see... an apple tree in bloom!&quot; She pointed to the helmeted jager. &quot;And... and a child&#039;s scooter!&quot; She pointed to the cavalry-hat jager. &quot;And... yes, I see it... an elegant silver teaspoon!&quot; She pointed to the last jager, the one with the fez and glasses.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow, she&#039;s good,&quot; the last jager grinned. &quot;I&#039;m Silver, und dis next to me is my sister Scuta. An&#039; our fearless leader iz Blum.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I also see... a large seed... and a sugar-encrusted bell. What can you tell me of these visions, monsters?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean Babs and-&quot; Scuta Lu flinched as Apple Blum tried to kick her. &quot;OOOOOH. Um, sorry, but ve know nutting of dem. Ve see nutting, know NUT-TING!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dot&#039;s a bad German accent, not a bad Slavic accent,&quot; Silver (Spoon) muttered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, whatever your names are, the Great and Powerful <b>Trixie</b> von Payne will not have her performers play next to corp... er, to bod... er... to whatever you are!&quot; Trixie slipped a brief wink into her tirade. &quot;I&#039;m going to go have a word with the mayor about this insult!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Goot luck vit dot,&quot; Scuta chirped. &quot;The mayor&#039;s der one keeping der book on ven ve finally kick off!&quot;</p><p class="double">A high-pitched whine echoed overhead, and Twilight looked up just in time to see a contrail zip across the sky. It glittered with faint rainbow colors.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mind if I join you?&quot; Twilight asked Trixie. &quot;I want to know if anybody&#039;s placed a bet on, &#039;jagers released by daring hero with Europa-wide reputation.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">As they walked off, Silver muttered, &quot;Thanks for askink about Diamond Tiara... &#039;Olga&#039;...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">There were three guards at the east gate. The guard captain was a grizzled veteran of the Long War and the fight against the Other, and he had the sense to try diplomacy with monsters, especially monsters riding dire bears. Unfortunately the other two were just kids with no real battle experience, and thus no sense. Plenty of rattled nerves, though.</p><p class="double">&quot;The gate is closed until dawn,&quot; the captain said, not without a bit of stuttering. It was a very big bear.</p><p class="double">&quot;Der gate iz not actually clozed,&quot; the female jagermonster on the bear&#039;s back said. Multicolored pink hair and a pair of angry eyes were all that stuck out from behind mask and wraps. &quot;I merely vish to enter-&quot;</p><p class="double">Up on the walls, one of the other guards suffered from a twitch in their trigger finger. Without looking up the jager caught the crossbow bolt and snapped it in her fingers. &quot;I forgiv. <b>Vunce</b>.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then one of the young guards panicked. &quot;FIRE!!&quot;</p><p class="double">At which point, in the guard captain&#039;s professional estimation, it all went to hell.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had just finished explaining her plan to Rainbow Dash, who had watched the performance of The Sparkle Boys and the Race to the West Pole with the aid of three buckets of popcorn. &quot;What&#039;s that sound?&quot; she asked, poking her head out of Madame Olga&#039;s fortune-telling tent.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sounds like a convenient diversion!&quot; Rainbow Dash said, pushing past Twilight and pointing at the guards abandoning the square- and the gallows.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay,&quot; Twilight said, dashing over to the gallows. &quot;Girls,&quot; she said to the trio strung up on the gallows, &quot;play along with Rainbow, then meet up with the circus on the road in a couple days, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Play along?&quot; Applebloom asked. &quot;How did you think we got up here in the first place?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash grinned a little embarrassed grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I&#039;ve gotta go run and scream in panic now, OK?&quot;</p><p class="double">About thirty seconds later, Rainbow Dash jumped to the top of the gallows and shouted, &quot;WICKED MONSTERS, HEAR ME! If you swear to defeat the monster attacking this fair city, I shall release you from this slow but well-deserved death! What say you? Shall you join me in this glorious cause?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Um... Ja! Ve vill do az hyu zay... for now!&quot; Scootaloo&#039;s acting was just short of dreadful, but the panicked townspeople, their attention grabbed by the great hero Rainbow Trygvassen&#039;s shout, ate it up.</p><p class="double">A blade flashed out, three ropes were snapped, and four figures rushed towards the center of the chaos.</p><p class="double">&quot;VE HUNT!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;VE HUNT!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;CUTIE MARK JAGERS TOWN DEFENDERS, YAAAAAY!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, it just slipped out.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Diamond Tiara asked, brushing her bear, &quot;you say you found Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shore did.&quot; The four jager-fillies didn&#039;t bother with the Loop-local accent when alone. &quot;An&#039; she smells right. She&#039;s the one we wuz lookin&#039; for afore we Awoke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t like that,&quot; Diamond growled. &quot;I mean, we&#039;ve been in war Loops, you know? But I&#039;ve never felt so railroaded by a Loop before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve never felt so gypped by a Loop before,&quot; Applebloom grumbled. &quot;I&#039;m supposed ta be th&#039; technical genius outta us, right? So how come I don&#039;t get to be a Spark? How come I&#039;m comic relief?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because... you&#039;re covered in tree sap?&quot; Diamond Tiara pointed out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not our fault Fust knocked us into that stand of pines,&quot; Scootaloo muttered, pointing at the sheepish-looking bear.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know,&quot; Silver Spoon whined, trying to get her glasses clean, &quot;this was so funny when it wasn&#039;t happening to me...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I really miss Sweetie Belle,&quot; Applebloom sighed. &quot;I wonder if she&#039;s even in this Loop?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.9 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was the day after Summer Sun Celebration at start of the new loop, and all the crusaders minus Nyx were present and awake, Silver a unicorn this time around. One thing was strange though, the teacher was nowhere to be seen. The crusaders had their desks circled since the teacher was so late and they discussed the odd phenomenon, Applebloom leading the discussion. &quot;I recall he was never on time to class. Ya think it&#039;s a variant teacher, or a looper?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo and Diamond bet five bits on a looper while Silver, Applebloom and Sweetie believed a variant teacher was here. It was ten minutes later that the stallion arrived, a unicorn bearing an orange red mane and a very light tan coat with a strange five-spoked circular cutie mark unlike any they had seen before.</p><p class="double">He strode to the front of the class rambling to himself loud enough to be heard by all, &quot;Hm, fascinating. Human Equine body in nature, too short to be full sized horse, race must be pony size throughout lifecycle. Symbol on flank, image of citadel council, what could it mean? Must check memories. Hmm...yes, I see. So the purpose of the mark is your special talent, wonder why the citadel council, could be because of connection to special tasks group, supporting the council in their intelligence roll. Also a school teacher, must be replacing a local looper else I&#039;d be a professor at a college in Manehatten, anchor perhaps?&quot;</p><p class="double">He shook his head as his horn started glowing, bringing chalk to the board, &quot;no no no no, must always have an anchor, Shepard is anchor, not me. Someone else must be anchor. How am I going to write the daily plan, hm, seems the chalk is moving for me surrounded by an orange glow. Biotics? No, I can sense no implants in my own head, wait, I can scan my own head without omnitool? bizarre, must be something similar to biotics, maybe...yes, yes, YES! It must be magic, like the one in Potter&#039;s universe, good times replacing Snape as potions master.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver, Applebloom and Sweetie groaned and forked over several bits to the victors of the bet. After copying his lesson plan to the board from memory, the stallion turned to his class, &quot;Greetings, class, sorry for the delay, was preparing a lesson plan, got caught up and lost track of time.&quot;</p><p class="double">The class droned, &quot;Good morning, Professor Solus!&quot;</p><p class="double">The teacher gave a small grin, &quot;Excellent, but remember you can call me Mordin. Now, I have a question, only raise your hoof if you understand what I&#039;m asking, how many of you are loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">As five hooves rose, Applebloom thought at least the loop wouldn&#039;t be boring.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.10 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... welcome to Equestria!&quot; Twilight Sparkle looked over the strange unicorn. Blue coat, white mane, and a beard that Starswirl would have been proud of. A cutie mark of a golden crown with rubies mounted into the tines. Strange eyes with no iris and pupils that had a white spot in the center of each.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hello there, hallucination,&quot; the unicorn said, his voice wavering a bit with age. &quot;I have to say, this Loop seems quite like home. And my hallucinations seldom begin conversations.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not a hallucination,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle, and I&#039;m the local Anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m the Ice King. Pleased to meet you. Are you sure you&#039;re not a hallucination?&quot; the old unicorn asked. &quot;You&#039;re not a ghost, a spirit, a magical being?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I am a magical being,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;This is the magical kingdom of Equestria, after all.&quot;</p><p class="double">A glint appeared in the old pony&#039;s eye. &quot;Magical kingdom? Tell me, purple horse... do you have... princesses?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, yes,&quot; Twilight said cautiously. &quot;In fact, Princess Celestia will be in this town tomorrow for the Summer Sun Celebration. Why do you ask?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no reason,&quot; the Ice King said, smiling broadly. Twilight noted the sharp, angular teeth.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;... Princess Celestia!&quot;</p><p class="double">The curtains opened, like usual, and the balcony was empty, like usual.</p><p class="double">And then, in a clap of thunder, it wasn&#039;t empty anymore. It was full of Nightmare Moon, much more furious than Twilight could recall her being in any Loop, Awake or not.</p><p class="double">&quot;WHERE IS MY SISTER?&quot; The Royal Canterlot Voice, amplified by a thousand years of slow-cooked stewed evil, shook the walls of the town hall. &quot;NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO KIDNAP MY SISTER EXCEPT ME!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... who are you, exactly?&quot; Applejack, who wasn&#039;t Awake, asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;And what do you mean, &#039;where is your sister&#039;?&quot; asked Rainbow Dash, who was. &quot;Aren&#039;t you supposed to have sealed her in the sun or something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This was my plan,&quot; Nightmare Moon nodded. &quot;But obviously there are more important things afoot than my revenge. Some foul villain has dared to lay hooves on my sister! For the honor of Equestria, this must not stand!&quot; In a swirl of smoke, the Nightmare shifted from the balcony to the floor of the town hall. &quot;My little ponies, who shall join me in bringing this miscreant to justice?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aw, yeah!&quot; Rainbow Dash grinned. &quot;Kicking flank alongside Nightmare Moon? I like this Loop already! C&#039;mon, girls! You know what time it is?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a quarter past five,&quot; a voice murmured from the door.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash groaned and facehoofed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m sorry,&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;My watch might be a bit slow. Please don&#039;t be angry. Never mind.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.11 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double">&quot;...And, ah... who are you, um, all representing?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis smiled. &quot;The badlands, sir. I thought it was about time for us all to be represented in the Equestrian Games, seeing as we&#039;ve been rather... well, disorganized up to this point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I still don&#039;t see why I have to fly against prissy ponies--&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen snarled at the red dragon. &quot;Do you <i>want</i> to spend a night in beetleblack cavern?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NomaamI&#039;llbegoodmaam!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good.&quot; Chrysalis took a breath and turned back to the official with an apologetic smile. &quot;Sorry about that. Anyway, my application?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah...&quot; The poor stallion tapped his clipboard nervously. &quot;I&#039;m not sure phoenixes are allowed to race.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, well.&quot; She sighed and nuzzled the dejected hatchling. &quot;Sorry Peewee, I guess we&#039;ll have to go with plan B. Oh consooooort?&quot;</p><p class="double">A blue unicorn with glittering butterfly wings trotted up. &quot;You called upon the Great and Powerful Trixie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I do so hate to impose, but would you do me the honor of joining in this relay with me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie supposes she has time in her schedule for that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great,&quot; the red dragon muttered. &quot;Now one of my <i>teammates</i> is-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Beetleblack cavern.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;-an absolutely awesome pony!&quot; he finished with a tight smile. &quot;I can see why she&#039;s your consort, ahahahaha!&quot;</p><p class="double">The poor race official took a deep breath... and shrugged. &quot;What the hay. You&#039;re in.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.12 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Twilight had lived through solo baseline Loops more times than she&#039;d ever care to recount to anyone. Some of the antics by her non-looping friends could make her smile in nostalgia, or at least shake her head with begrudging amusement. Some though... Some just made her grit her teeth every time they came up.</p><p class="double">Like the current situation.</p><p class="double">The attempt to fake a timberwolf attack on Applejack to clear Spike&#039;s &#039;life debt&#039; had turned into a real timberwolf attack and everyone, including Spike, was running around in panic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike,&quot; she deadpanned as the dragonling ran past her.</p><p class="double">&quot;We have to get out of here!&quot; Spike shouted back, before turning back around. &quot;I have to help Applejack get out of here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Spike</i>,&quot; she put a bit of force into her words this time, and was rewarded with her little brother/adopted son/it&#039;s complicated&#039;s attention. &quot;Timberwolves are made of wood.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, yeah?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You breathe <i>fire</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; Spike blinked at that, before getting that look of dawning comprehension. &quot;Ohhhhh...&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragonling turned back towards the timberwolves with a malicious grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Go get &#039;em Spike.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(optional ending by KrisOverstreet):</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next day the girls all visited Spike in the hospital. The little dragon in the body cast was glad to see them... well, all but one.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Timberwolves are made of wood,&#039; you said,&quot; he grumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, yeah, I did say that, didn&#039;t I?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;You breathe fire,&#039; you said.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that was me too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pity you forgot to mention that soggy, rotten, green wood doesn&#039;t burn for beans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, yeah. That was my bad.&quot; Twilight scratched the back of her head with her hoof.</p><p class="double">Thankfully Applejack had persuaded Spike that, for risking his own life (and nearly losing it) to save hers, he and she were quit of that life-debt thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;By the way, Twilight? Could you bring me my crayons?&quot; Spike still had the use of his right arm.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, I&#039;d love to,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;What are you going to do with them?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think the Honor Code of Noble Dragons needs an edit. &#039;If someone saves your life, you owe them service until you can return the favor- unless that someone was the one who put you in danger in the first place.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re just not gonna let me live that one down, are you Spike?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and apologized for the fifth time. It was going to be a long, long rest of the Loop. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.13 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;... Ponyville qualifies!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow glided over to where Bulk Biceps and Fluttershy were waiting. &quot;That. Was. INCREDIBLE!&quot; she gushed. &quot;I would never have believed she could do it! And for that leg of the course, with the corkscrew hoops and the double backflip maneuver! I was feeling really guilty about joining the Cloudsdale team,&quot; Rainbow added, kicking a bit of cloud under her hooves in embarrassment, &quot;but with her on the team, Ponyville has an honest chance to medal!&quot;</p><p class="double">Back at the finish line, a certain cross-eyed pegasus received the congratulations of the Wonderbolts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, the thing is,&quot; Fluttershy said, &quot;all we did was tell her that, as soon as she got the horseshoe, she was to fly as fast as she could in a straight line towards the goal.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A straight line?&quot; Rainbow Dash looked up to see the blonde pegasus require three tries to grasp a well-wisher&#039;s hoof for a hoofshake. &quot;Yeah... yeah, I can see that.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;YEAH!&quot;</b> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.14 (Goldude)</p><p class="double">&quot;So that means you <i>could</i> fly with us.&quot; Spitfire offered. After all, she thought Rainbow Dash was better than Soarin anyway. They could definitely qualify with such an asset.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash, on the other hand, had some doubts. &quot;Fly? You mean... practice with you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fleetfoot smirked and nodded. &quot;Yeah, exactly. So what do you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spitfire added, &quot;You can be our third. At least until Soarin&#039;s better.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash had a decision to make. It was either Ponyville, or Cloudsdale. Or she could switch between them and hope no one notices. Or... &quot;Sure, I&#039;d love to.&quot; Spitfire and Fleetfoot smiled. Now they&#039;d definitely qualify. &quot;You can practice with all of me!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash turned to face her Ponyville team of Bulk Biceps and Fluttershy and inhaled a large breath for a yelling order. &quot;BRING &#039;EM HERE, PONYVILLE!&quot;</p><p class="double">The two teammates looked at each other and nodded, then flying off.</p><p class="double">Spitfire was a little confused. &quot;Um-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shh. Wait for it!&quot; Rainbow Dash smiled as she urged The Wonderbolts to see her big surprise. Soon enough, the sky began to darken... then turn blue. Both Fleetfoot and Spitfire removed their sunglasses and squinted. A sea of blue was converging on them, and in that sea of blue were a bunch of prismatic manes.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash smirked. The Mirror Pond came in handy at times. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.15 (EdBeccera)</p><p class="double">The Sun has set, and Luna presides over her Night Court in Canterlot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mac, call the next case.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.16 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Twilight had a plan.</p><p class="double">A plan to ease Luna&#039;s reintroduction to Equestria in general and Ponyville in particular before the Nightmare Night incident came around this Loop. It was a plan that involved Pinkie Pie, so great care was needed to make sure it didn&#039;t get out of hoof.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie!&quot; Twilight reigned in the Unawake version of her hyperactive friend. &quot;Look, I know you&#039;re excited and all, but <i>please</i> don&#039;t go overboard on this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But Twilight,&quot; Pinkie pleaded, &quot;you said she hasn&#039;t had one for a thousand years! There&#039;s so much time to make up for and–&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut her friend of by the simple expedient of shoving her hoof in Pinkie&#039;s mouth. &quot;And Princess Celestia has told me that she wants to be the one to make it up to Luna in her own way and time. You wouldn&#039;t want to deprive her of family bonding time with her sister, would you? Not after a thousand years apart.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie&#039;s expression softened and she shook her head in the negative.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, just one party,&quot; Twilight reminded her friend. &quot;We&#039;re not making up for a thousand years of missed opportunities, we&#039;re welcoming a brand new friend who&#039;s essentially new to Equestria. One who is probably feeling a little overwhelmed by all the unfamiliar sights and maybe even a bit left out by how different she is from everypony else. One who could really use some new friends who won&#039;t judge her unfairly. Think you can do that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie nodded enthusiastically.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Really, sister,&quot; Luna huffed a bit as the diarchs trotted up to the Golden Oaks Library in Ponyville, &quot;what possible business could thy student have <i>today</i> that could not be put off?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Patience, sister,&quot; Celestia chided playfully. &quot;You&#039;ll see when we get inside. Why don&#039;t you do the honors?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna rolled her eyes and reluctantly opened the door before stepping into the surprisingly dark interior. Really, could her sister&#039;s student not at least arrange for sufficient light–</p><p class="double">&quot;SURPRISE!&quot; chorused over a dozen voices as the sudden illumination of the room temporarily blinded the diarch of the moon. When her eyes adjusted, she took in the near-sea of ponies in the main lobby, the decorations, the massive banner...</p><p class="double">Reading what the banner said caused Luna&#039;s eyes to tear up and her hoof to fly to her mouth from emotional shock. They&#039;d remembered. She hadn&#039;t thought anyone remembered, pony or otherwise. That they&#039;d all forgotten. That <i>Tia</i> had forgotten...</p><p class="double">&quot;Happy birthday, Luna,&quot; Celestia whispered to her sister as she gently nudged the moon princess further in towards the awaiting well-wishers. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.17 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">It had taken a number of Loops to figure out how to set it up, but Twilight was finally ready to reenact a rather funny skit she&#039;d picked up from the Hub at some point.</p><p class="double">Sure, she&#039;d needed to change a few things. For one, actually killing the non-looping contestants (since this reenactment wasn&#039;t to be a stage production) wouldn&#039;t be particularly funny, no matter what some other loopers out in the multiverse thought. So she&#039;d replaced the &#039;shooting yourself in the head&#039; bit at the end with &#039;hitting yourself in the face with a pie&#039;. For another, ponies generally didn&#039;t wear undergarments, so she&#039;d needed something else for the &#039;removing a bra&#039; portion. Several other parts of the contest had been altered to fit pony society and in general ensure the safety of the contestants in spite of themselves.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked out over the field and the contestants who were lined up. Blueblood had practically fallen over himself to sign up despite the rather obvious implications in the contest name and numerous other nobles and wealthy elite, like Upper Crust, had followed his example without thinking. Twilight actually thought it was rather unfair how easy it had been getting their willing participation, but the humor potential was too good to pass up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mares and Gentlestallions!&quot; she called out to the crowd from her position as announcer. &quot;Welcome to the first annual &#039;Upper Class Twit of the Year&#039; competition!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.18 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double">&quot;And you usually lose <i>how</i> many of the other students?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, currently a teenager and also known as a &#039;Super High School-Level Wizard&#039;, stared at her new classmate with a mix of astonishment and horror. Naegi - a.k.a. &#039;Super High School-Level Good Luck&#039;, and Anchor for loops in Hope&#039;s Peak Academy – wilted pretty much instantly under it.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not saying I try to <i>let</i> it happen or anything,&quot; Naegi countered, shamefacedly, &quot;But getting a loop with no deaths is barely doable in my baseline. So I warn anybody new to this loop ahead of time about the body count, since I know my loop is...kind of depressing.&quot;</p><p class="double">That was putting it mildly. Twilight sighed.</p><p class="double">&quot;You also said that you know who the person who started this twisted game is, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah...&quot; Naegi glanced warily at the nearby cameras, &quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;If I hadn&#039;t seen it, I wouldn&#039;t have believed it,&quot; Naegi admitted, &quot;Although I don&#039;t know if that spell you did really &#039;reformed&#039; her any.&quot;</p><p class="double">Behind them, lying amongst a pile of shut-down Monokumas, the Mastermind known as Enoshima Junko hugged herself and giggled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Luckily my talent was &#039;wizard&#039;, so I could still cast that spell,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;But it was supposed to make her feel all the suffering she inflicted on others.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And it was the BEST!&quot; Enoshima exclaimed suddenly, latching onto Twilight&#039;s ankle, &quot;All that despair! That wonderful, wonderful despair! Do it again? Please? Pleeeasse?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only if you&#039;re good,&quot; Twilight found herself replying.</p><p class="double">Naegi rubbed the back of his head and chuckled. Well, this was <i>one</i> way to make sure everyone lived. And if Enoshima gave her new &#039;bestest best friend in the whole wide universe&#039; a break, maybe Twilight could try that memory spell she&#039;d mentioned. It&#039;d be nice to finally get that memory of his first year of school back... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">56.19 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double">Cheerilee awoke. She was human again, which was becoming rather common recently. She was at the controls of some sort of flying craft. Some sort of weird combination of helicopter and jet. It seemed to be on autopilot at the moment, which she was thankful for, as she probably wouldn&#039;t know how to fly until her loop memories hit.</p><p class="double">&#039;Ah, there!&#039; she thought.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been hired to tutor a child and she&#039;d was currently on the flight to his location. The job itself filled her with misgivings. For one thing, the remote location. Who, possibly, living way out in the boonies would hire a tutor? Secondly, her sources, mainly gossiping secretaries at the temp agency she worked at, said that the previous tutor, a Mr. Shu, had been on the job for less than a day. That didn&#039;t bode well. Was her new boss difficult to please? Was the child temperamental, causing him to quit? Its possible he was a lousy teacher, but the other two options loomed in her mind as well. If nothing else, at least the money was good, if she could stay on.</p><p class="double">She was coming up on the address, 439 East District, supposedly near the foot of Mt. Paozu. Nearing the mountain, she took the craft off of auto, and looked for the house. It wasn&#039;t too long before she spotted it, a small and simple domed house, one those prefabs you could buy in a capsule. The very opposite of fancy.</p><p class="double">She brought the craft in for a landing and stepped out only to be greeted by a black haired woman wearing a simple purple dress. Cheerilee smiled and returned the greeting.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi! You must be Chichi Son?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! You must be the new tutor the agency sent.&quot; Chichi returned the smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! I&#039;m Sara Lee. Pleased to meet you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, the same here. Its so hard to get good tutors up here, and while my Gohan can study on his own, there&#039;s no substitute for a good teacher.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee continued to make pleasant conversation with Chichi until she brought her to what he assumed to be Gohan&#039;s room, opening the door.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gohan, you have a new tutor! Say hello to Ms. Lee.&quot;</p><p class="double">When Cheerilee entered the door, she saw a small kid, possibly 10yrs old. He had his black hair cut somewhat short, and was wearing a tea shirt and pants hung by suspenders. As he got up, he crossed the room and gave a short bow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot; he said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, he&#039;s quite the charmer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;ll leave you two to his studies. Dinner&#039;s at 7.&quot; said Chichi as she closed the door behind him.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re different.&quot;</p><p class="double">The got Cheerilee sweating. &quot;Is that good or bad?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, your powerlevel is about as high as most people, but I keep getting this weird echo that tells me that there is more to you than that. Are you a fighter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I don&#039;t think I am, but I received a little training from someone in the past.&quot; She thought back to the loop with the battle clothes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can you teach me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It wasn&#039;t that much, and I think your Mom wants me to teach you more from what its in those books.&quot; she said as she pointed to the books on the desk.</p><p class="double">Gohan looked crestfallen. &quot;Awww...&quot;</p><p class="double">The kid could sense power levels, whatever that was, but he&#039;s pretty young. How much could he know? &quot;Well, ask your Mom, and if she says okay, I&#039;ll see what I can teach.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Cheerilee hadn&#039;t know how she got there, but she was standing in a grass field. Bottles of milk flew off majestically in the distance. A white cat with a cane walked by next to her and asked her where the bus to Orange City was. She pointed to the bus stop, which had mysteriously appeared to her left, and he thanked her by telling her she needed to look behind her. When she did, there was Gohan.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi.&quot; he started.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um..Hi.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re in a dream you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is this one of those lucid dream things where you can control it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not quite. I apologize for entering your dream. I felt guilty about asking you to train me, and I couldn&#039;t sleep.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh why is that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Gohan looked down and tapped the tips of his fingers together.</p><p class="double">&quot;Umm...I&#039;m one of the strongest fighters on this planet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; Cheerilee started, &quot;Now I know I&#039;m dreaming.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Its true. Both sides of my family have a strong martial arts tradition, and I&#039;m also a half alien on my father&#039;s side.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know you sound crazy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gohan thought for a moment. &quot;Well my dad won one of the former martial arts tournaments. I can show you the belt from that when we wake up.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So if that’s true, how come you still wanted me to train you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, my mom wants me to study all the time...and I thought if you could convince her, I could get out of the house every now and again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow. Your mom is hardcore about studying.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. You could say that.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once she was up, Gohan had indeed shown her the Championship Belt from the World&#039;s Martial Arts Tournament. That confirmed, she had tried to get Chichi to tell her more at breakfast. Gohan, who&#039;d just polished off 5 massive stacks of pancakes, had gone back to studying.</p><p class="double">&quot;So Chichi, Gohan said his dad won the World Tournament.&quot; Cheerilee said as she buttered some toast.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes.&quot; Chichi got a faraway look in her eyes. &quot;I actually met my husband Goku there. Well, actually I hadn&#039;t met him there. I knew him from when we were kids, but it was the first time I&#039;d seen him in awhile. I was competing as well and we met in the semi-finals. He proposed to me the same day. It was very romantic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee smiled. &quot;So you&#039;re a martial artist, and your husband&#039;s a martial artist, how come you want Gohan to study so much, not that I&#039;m complaining, as I&#039;m here to help with that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you see, martial arts doesn&#039;t pay so well. I grew up in my dad&#039;s castle, my dad is the Ox-King, you know.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee searched her memories for a reference to someone named or titled the Ox-King, but came up empty. She, however, smiled and nodded for Chichi to continue.</p><p class="double">&quot;But poor Goku never really went to school and he was poor for most of his life. I don&#039;t want my Gohan to end up the same way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But surely he could use a break every now and then.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chichi&#039;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Gohan put you up to this, didn&#039;t he?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee put up her hands in a placating gesture.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t let him stop. He&#039;ll fall behind. He can rest after he&#039;s graduated from a good school.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think you need to worry about. He&#039;s very bright for his age.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, but schools are very competitive nowadays.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Time to bring out the big guns,&#039; Cheerilee thought.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know Chichi, you can&#039;t just have him keep studying and studying. The mind needs to rest every now and then. It needs variety. The latest education research shows that those who take the occasional breaks get better results and retain what the learn better.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That can get out of hand and you know it.&quot; Chichi gave her a serious look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why don&#039;t we do this? We&#039;ll put together a study and relaxation schedule. When its time for study, we study, but when its time for a break, he takes a break. And...there are standardized tests for these sorts of things, so we&#039;ll know exactly where Gohan&#039;s progress lies, and where his strengths and weakpoints are,&quot;</p><p class="double">Chichi put a hand on her chin as if consider it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well okay, maybe we can try that out and see where it goes, but if I don&#039;t like the results, we&#039;re going back to doing it my way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thats excellent! You won&#039;t regret it!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It went well. Gohan got a few hours of break interspersed throughout the day, and he&#039;d never been happier. However that all changed a few weeks later. Cheerilee had been about to enter the house when it suddenly slammed open of its own accord, throwing her against the house. Pushing the door back the way it came, she suddenly saw Gohan running, then flying off into the distance. As she started to move, it suddenly swung open on her once again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oww...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t just stand there! You&#039;ve got a jet copter! After him!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee wasn&#039;t about to risk angering a distraught Chichi, so she pulled out the capsule and activated it on the ground in front of her. With her in the pilot&#039;s seat, and Chichi in the copilot&#039;s, they took off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;There. Head that way.&quot; Chichi pointed in what seemed to be a random direction.</p><p class="double">&quot;What happened? Why?&quot; said Cheerilee, already adjusting the course.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can sense Gohan in that direction. There&#039;d better be big trouble, or he&#039;s in big trouble.&quot;</p><p class="double">The big question on Cheerilee&#039;s mind kept popping up, so she risked asking it. &quot;So Gohan can fly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, he learned how to a few years back.&quot; There was an edge to her voice that indicated she really wasn&#039;t willing to say anything further on the issue, but that was interesting. It was the second time she&#039;d encountered humans flying in the loops, and she wondered if it was common.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After a few minor course corrections, they landed in a desert plain strewn with boulders and mountains in the distance. There was Gohan, and he wasn&#039;t the only one. There were also what appeared to be a green haired teenaged girl, a warrior with major scars on his face and a floating cat by his side, a bald midget in an orange gi, a taller warrior with a pink shirt with the word &#039;Badman&#039; on the back, a purple haired warrior with a sword strapped to his back, but the strangest and unusual of all were the triclops, the other flying midget who seemed to be wearing clown makeup and a green skinned being that her loop memories were shouting was Demon King Piccolo, the person who&#039;d nearly destroyed the world years back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Isn&#039;t that the Demon King Piccolo?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And he&#039;s probably behind putting my Gohan in danger.&quot; said Chichi as she leaped from the copter.</p><p class="double">&quot;You! What is wrong with you...&quot; yelled Chichi as she ran off to Piccolo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Scary...&quot; Cheerilee muttered to herself as she landed the jet copter and took off her helmet.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After observing the group dynamic for a moment, she noticed that Gohan was mostly at ease with the crowd and Piccolo had made no move to destroy everybody despite Chichi ranting at him, Cheerilee decided it was safe to come out of the Jet Copter,</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey Gohan! Who&#039;re your friends?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, hi, Ms. Lee! That&#039;s Mr. Piccolo, Krillin, Bulma, Yamcha, Tien and Chaotzu. That&#039;s Vegeta, and that purple haired warrior over there, we don&#039;t know the name of yet, but he totally saved all our lives.&quot; Gohan pointed to each in turn. &quot;You totally missed it! He just went Super-saiyan, and slash-slash, Frieza and his father were beaten.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;That remains to be seen. Kakkarot and I are the only Saiyans left. If you count the half-breed, that makes three. So where&#039;d mystery boy come from?&quot; Vegeta thought for a moment. &quot;And for that matter, who&#039;re you?&quot;</p><p class="double">It was 30 seconds, and Cheerilee already didn&#039;t like Vegeta, but she responded. &quot;I&#039;m Sara Lee, I&#039;m Gohan&#039;s tutor.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a wave of &#039;Ahs&#039; and &#039;Ohs&#039; from the assembled group, with a single &#039;Hmmph&#039; thrown in from Vegeta.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what are we waiting around for?&quot; asked Cheerilee</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re waiting for my dad!&quot; Gohan cheerfully cried.</p><p class="double">&quot;Your dad?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mystery boy claims he knows when he&#039;ll arrive.&quot; muttered Vegeta.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A couple of hours had passed and a loud whistling could be heard in the sky followed by what looked like a meteorite came crashing down to earth.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s him! Lets go!&quot; Him and half dozen others took off after the decending craft.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee was about to head back to her copter when Bulma stopped her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait! Gohan, you carry your Mom. Yamcha, you can carry both of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What!&quot; cried Yamcha.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay!&quot; responded Gohan.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Bulma and Cheerilee sat in the copter, while Yamcha carried it from the underside.</p><p class="double">&quot;Much quicker this way. So I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re a looper? Its very rare for the Sons to get more than one tutor. Usually, the first one sours them on the whole experience. I&#039;m Bulma Briefs, the anchor of this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee took the offered hand and shook it. &quot;I&#039;m Cheerilee, a looper from Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh Equestria! That&#039;s always a fun place. I was there once. Replaced Twilight Sparkle for the loop, from what I understand. I think I remember you, though you weren&#039;t Awake at the time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, after the next events, which seems to be starting soon,&quot; Bulma nodded to the approaching impact crater, &quot;Gohan will probably be too busy to study, so you&#039;ll probably be out of job. See me when that happens, and I&#039;ll try to set you up elsewhere.&quot; Bulma produced a card from a card from somewhere and gave it to Cheerilee.</p><p class="double">&quot;That’s very nice of you. Thanks!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your welcome.&quot; said Bulma, and then suddenly leaning out of the copter, she yelled &quot;Good job Yamcha! Keep it up!&quot;</p><p class="double">A muffled &quot;Oof&quot; was all Cheerilee could hear. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Bulma had indeed been correct. The threat of the androids had forced Gohan&#039;s family to put his studies on hold. With Gohan off training, there was nothing for her to do, and while Chichi had given a good recommendation, she was curious about Bulma&#039;s offer, which was why she found herself sitting across from her at the present moment.</p><p class="double">Bulma had set out the most delicious peaches she&#039;d ever eaten, and despite her willpower, she couldn&#039;t help but eat peach after peach.</p><p class="double">&quot;These are heavenly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Funny you should mention that. They are just that. They&#039;re called Ensenji, and normally they grow in the Otherworld, but I&#039;ve manage to cultivate them on Earth in my private atrium.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee stopped chewing as her eyes opened wide. </p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, don&#039;t give me that. I&#039;d never give you something harmful, in fact just the opposite. These will help you survive this loop. They significantly raises the powerlevel of the eater, though the law of diminishing returns kicks in sharply after a set point. They&#039;ve got the added benefit of providing near eternal youth, which is, while my baseline self is not exactly old by any stretch of the imagination, I still look like a teenager.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee continued to chew, but slower.</p><p class="double">&quot;I eat one of these a day, at least. They&#039;re really quite good,&quot; Bulma continued. &quot;Now I imagine you might have some questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee swallowed her bite, and then spoke. &quot;Gohan mentioned it before, but what is powerlevel?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Its a measure of your ki, your internal energy, if your not familiar with the other term. Its primarily used for fighting, but it can be used for other things like flying, as you might have noticed. Those peaches should grant you enough energy to easily run around the planet several times a day without rest.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re kidding?&quot; Cheerilee exclaimed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope. Its kinda crazy. But it is necessary, because even though 99% of the time you won&#039;t need it, every few years some incredibly dangerous opponent tends to threaten the earth.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your very blasé about all this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remember? Anchor? Loops?&quot; stated Bulma.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, we tend not have much problem with them anymore. While I can take care of all threats, and I have at one point or the other, I prefer just to nudge things in the right direction when no one else is looping.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, back there, my loop memories were telling me that that was Demon King Piccolo, someone who had previously tried to destroy the earth on national TV, and at the World&#039;s Martial Tournament, but Gohan seemed downright friendly with him. I must be missing something, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a little more complicated than that. This Piccolo is the son, and genetic clone, of that one. He&#039;s got all his father&#039;s memories, but in recent years, he&#039;s reformed. A lot of the fighters you met are like that, to one degree or the other. Reformed I mean, not the other thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, I&#039;ve probably talked enough about myself and my loop. How&#039;re the loops treating you so far?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Its very overwhelming. I&#039;ve not had many loops, but the last two were fused. The one before the last, I was teaching at this weird high school where the students did battle with these self aware school uniforms. The one afterwards, I was again a teacher, a music teacher specifically, but the world itself was very bizarre, with cause and effect seldom agreeing with each other.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you pick up any souvenirs?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee&#039;s eyes narrowed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh don&#039;t be like that. I&#039;m a scientist and engineer. I like seeing new pieces of technology. I might be able to even improve on them in some way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well okay. These are two main things I&#039;ve got. The first..&quot; Cheerilee activated her bracelet, which swapped her life threads uniform with her current clothes. &quot;The second are these..&quot; She removed what looked like two integrated circuits. &quot;These are EBEs, or Electronic Brain Enhancements. They snap to your forehead like this..&quot; She placed one of the EBEs on one side of her and the other on the other side. &quot;They stay in place for some reason, though I&#039;m not really sure the reason why.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bulma had quite the large grin on her face.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cheerilee, girl, you&#039;ve just become my new best friend. You&#039;ve given me something new to play with!”</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='61'></a><h3>Loops 57</h3>
<p>57.1 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"></p><p>The air in the library was a whirlwind of books and devices. Some came from the shelves, or zipped up out of the basement laboratory. Most of them came straight from Twilight&#039;s subspace pocket.</p><p class="double">Luckily for them, the Naruto swarm had gotten more than Twilight&#039;s attention. As soon as they&#039;d heard the story, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie had vowed to search the ends of the world for any other loopers that might be lurking around. Anypony around who had any skills that might be of help would be tree-sent. Applejack, Rarity, and Fluttershy were on damage control from the stampede.</p><p class="double">Almost before they&#039;d gotten Kakashi into the security of the library, Twilight had begun firing diagnostic spells left and right. Just as Twilight had feared, the loop resets had already wiped away all traces of whatever had been done to him.</p><p class="double">Naruto couldn&#039;t remember any specifics either. He&#039;d been &#039;preoccupied&#039;. And then the biju bomb he&#039;d launched reset the loop, and that&#039;s when they&#039;d discovered that Kakashi was <i>gone</i>.</p><p class="double">Well. There clearly wasn&#039;t a physical reason for it. All of Twilight&#039;s diagnostic spells told her that a healthy, normal – aside from the chakra system – pony was standing in front of her. So the cause had to be psychological. Unfortunately, it would take one of their best telepathy-users to figure out if there was anything of Kakashi left to be salvaged...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Huh. I&#039;ve never felt anyone <i>willingly</i> lock their mind up like this before,” Chrysalis said.</p><p class="double">...Or maybe it would just take a Changeling Queen, waving her glowing horn over Kakashi&#039;s head, to suss out the problem. Twilight immediately dropped thirty books on the different kinds of mind-manipulation magic, blinking in surprise.</p><p class="double">“He locked his <i>mind</i> up?” Naruto exclaimed, wings flaring in surprise.</p><p class="double">Zecora, who was consulting some books on brews and potions, looked quite pleased with the diagnosis.</p><p class="double">“That matches my suspicions perfectly,” the zebra said, “Indeed, I believed it as soon as I saw inside this tree.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve seen this before, Zecora?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">She was impressed. Not to mention embarrassed that she hadn&#039;t thought to ask Zecora first about the problem, just because she&#039;d assumed it was some kind of spell or something...there was probably a letter to Celestia in there somewhere.</p><p class="double">“A ninja of the Leaf I have been before,” Zecora replied, “Though I was not a healer then – I was fighting a war. When a ninja is faced with a reality deemed untrue, the blame will fall to an enemy genjutsu. Is this not so? Naruto?”</p><p class="double">Naruto&#039;s eyes were wide.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re saying Kakashi-sensei thought he was under genjutsu? <i>This whole time?</i>”</p><p class="double">“He still does, if I am not mistaken. Or would the gods not <i>act</i> if his mind was truly taken?”</p><p class="double">...Eeyup, <i>definitely</i> a letter to Celestia. &#039;Being older doesn&#039;t mean somepony else doesn&#039;t have good sense&#039;, something like that.</p><p class="double">“But that means we have to convince him he&#039;s not in an illusion...which is exactly what he&#039;ll expect an illusion to say, right?” Twilight&#039;s eyes darted back to her books.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve got something that might work,” Naruto mentioned.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d gone from nervous and jittery to completely at ease after hearing Zecora&#039;s explanation. Twilight could only suppose that Naruto was more comfortable getting the bad news from a fellow ninja – insomuch as Zecora qualified.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll need an extra pair of...hooves, though,” Naruto added, looking down at his hooves in mild annoyance, “Zecora, do you know any chakra transfer techniques...?” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.2 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight stepped into Mac&#039;s bar with consternation written across her face and signalled for a cider.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tough Loop?&quot; He asked as he slid her order over.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really, just a lonely baseline until it dropped a new expansion on me. It was... Annoying.&quot; Mac arched an eyebrow questioningly and she waved a hoof in an all-encompassing gesture. &quot;Discord.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is my baseline acting out again?&quot; Came the jovial voice as the devil in question arrived in the typical idiomatic manner. &quot;What did the scamp do this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tried teaching a lesson. <i>Again.</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh honestly, Twilight, when have I <i>ever</i> tried to teach anyone a lesson?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Plunder vines,&quot; she pointed out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not me, and you can&#039;t expect me to remember every little thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That time you stranded Apple Bloom and Diamond Tiara on a deserted island?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That turned out for the best, wouldn&#039;t you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;When you stuck Pinkie and Cranky Doodle on <i>the same island?</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it got <i>one</i> pony Looping, so I figured...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack and seapony Lyra on an island <i>in </i>the desert?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>You</i> got to lock them in a house.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That time ya stranded me an&#039; Smarty Pants out there?&quot; Mac chimed in.</p><p class="double">&quot;...I didn&#039;t actually know about that one,&quot; Twilight said after a moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;I shipped him off before he could leave the Awake signal and spent the rest of the Loop disguised as him.&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly the Loop with the plaid apples made a <i>lot</i> more sense to Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;But,&quot; Discord added, &quot;I <i>do</i> begin to see your point.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Good, just don&#039;t-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The island has gotten <i>far</i> too overplayed. Not to worry though, I know <i>just</i> how to resolve this friction between us.&quot;</p><p class="double">He snapped his claws and Twilight wasn&#039;t particularly surprised to find herself on an island.</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; She snorted before vanishing in a teleport.</p><p class="double">...And reappearing a few steps to the left. Frowning, she ascended and took flight, while Discord snapped himself up a pair of sunglasses and cracked open a coconut. A few moments later she landed again, coming from the opposite direction.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is actually fairly impressive,&quot; she conceded, horn glowing and face scrunched up in concentration as she evaluated the various enchantments and spatial folds he&#039;d set up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just a few tricks I&#039;ve been saving up for a special occasion. I figure it&#039;ll take a few days to unravel, even for <i>you</i>.&quot; He wrapped an arm around her neck and dragged her into a hug, &quot;<i>plenty</i> of time for us to sort out our differences!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I thought you said the island was overplayed,&quot; she groused.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, now it&#039;s a running gag.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.3 (Midnight Crescent)</p><p class="double"><u><hr></u></p><p class="double"><u>Twilight the Underdog</u></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, and was glad to find she was sat down. Unfortunately, she couldn’t quite keep hold of her cards.</p><p class="double"><i>Human again. High school again. What did I do to deserve this?</i> She thought as she started to focus on her Loop memories.</p><p class="double">“Hey, Earth to Josie.” A somewhat high pitched voice called from across the table. “Your hand can’t have been that ba...”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked across the table at the spiky haired kid, who was looking down at the cards she had dropped before continuing where he had left off. “On second thoughts, I’ll let you mulligan if you want.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, sure.” Twilight said, before quickly checking the memories as she shuffled her old hand into her deck. <i>OK, so I’m Josie Wheeler, I’m an unremarkable kid of divorced parents. I’m learning to play a collectible card game off a kid I bullied last year, and I’ve got a little sister who’s losing her eyesight.</i> Then the memory of her in-loop sister’s name hit her. <i>Oh no. I’ll come help you soon Nyx, I promise.</i></p><p class="double">The kid stared at her for a few seconds, before his eyes widened, and he lowered his voice. “Sorry Joey, didn’t realise you were awake too.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I <b>am</b> awake, but my names not Joey. Or Josie.”</p><p class="double">“Another fused loop?” Tristan asked, leaning down to prevent people from overhearing.</p><p class="double">“It sure looks that way...” Tea said, stretching out in her chair. </p><p class="double">“Well, the first thing we need to do is introduce you to Yami.” Yugi said, turning back to Twilight “I’ll get him to meet you after school. In the meantime, it’s time to duel.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, and began to draw cards. “My names Twilight, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“Nice to meet you, Twilight.” Yugi said, as he drew to start the duel.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I still think you did well for your first duel.” Yugi said. “Besides, Joey doesn’t really have any idea what he’s doing right now either at this point in the loop.”</p><p class="double">“I guess. It’s just annoying that I couldn’t get any of my... magic or traps?” She waited for Yugi, who nodded in confirmation. “I couldn’t get any of them out. Stupid luck of the draw.”</p><p class="double">“Actually, there’s two things I should tell you, before Yami shows up. Our world, or at least the baseline version, it’s not luck of the draw. A duelist pours their heart and soul into their deck. It should reflect their strengths and personality. And if they truly believe in their deck, then the Heart of the cards will reward them when they truly need it, as long as they trust their deck. It’s why Yami is the best duelist that ever lived. I know it sounds a little hokey, but...” He noticed Twilight was gesturing for him to pause. “What?”</p><p class="double">“Yugi, I’ve been in lots of fused loops now. I’ve seen a lot of different worlds, which contain a wide variety of strange forces and abilities. I’m from a world of multicoloured magical ponies. My best friends and I can defeat <b>anything</b> with the power of Friendship. I think I can manage a ‘Heart of the cards’ just fine.”</p><p class="double">Yugi’s jaw hung open for a short while, as he tried to process this new information. After almost a minute, he finally responded “Point taken, and Tea must never know about this.”</p><p class="double">“Understood. And your second point was?”</p><p class="double">“Well, there’s a reason you couldn’t draw any of your magic or trap cards.”</p><p class="double">“Let me guess. Heart of the cards?”</p><p class="double">Yugi shook his head. “Nothing like that. Joey just doesn’t have any in his deck yet. Although, I normally just grab both our loop end decks from my subspace at the start of a loop. Some of our cards are pretty rare, and you never know where a loop might diverge...”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded knowingly. “I know the feeling. What else do you keep in yours?”</p><p class="double">“Not much. A few alternate decks. Copies of each Millennium Item – our worlds powerful magic artefacts – just in case Yami feels like cutting a few things off early. I’ve not been on many loops outside this world that had anything worth keeping yet. You?”</p><p class="double">“Too many things to mention – I’m my worlds anchor, and I’ve been Looping quite a while now. I think at the front I have my element of harmony, a couple of light sabres – always pays to have a spare, I find – and a copy of the library of Alexandria.” She looked around her nervously. “Wasn’t your anchor supposed to be meeting me here?”</p><p class="double">Yugi stood with his mouth agape once again. <i>The Library of Alexandria? How does she fit that in there!?</i>Then he realised what he was doing. Shaking the thoughts from his head, he answered the question “Oh, sorry, slipped my mind. Just give me a minute.” Yugi closed his eyes and concentrated. An inverted pyramid slowly came into existence around his neck, almost like a jigsaw completing itself. Once it was complete, a light shone from the eye design on its front, briefly blinding Twilight.</p><p class="double">Once she had regained her sight, there was someone standing in front of her. It resembled Yugi, only taller. However, his posture had changed also, and there was something subtly different about his facial expression.</p><p class="double">“I’m going assume you’re Yami, which would explain why you took so long.”</p><p class="double">“Forgive me, but I must say I prefer to have Yugi deal with people who fuse into our loops first. He has always been more sociable than I.” Yami said, brushing one of the blonde waves of hair from his eyes. “Now, can I ask what your home Loop is?”</p><p class="double">“I’m originally from Equestria, although I don’t know if that means anything to you.”</p><p class="double">“It sounds familiar, but I don’t think I’ve met anyone from there before. Although, your description to Yugi tells me all I need to know...“</p><p class="double">“That’s understandable...” Twilight said as she thought it over. “So, how do your baseline events play out?”</p><p class="double">“Hmm... I think you may be the first Looper to actually ask that. Unfortunately, the answer may take a while.” Yami paused for a few moments, before nodding to himself and continuing “If you want a full rundown, you could visit the game store Yugi lives in. I can quite easily tell you everything there, and we can even build you a deck, if you want to completely replace Joey for this Loop.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds like a plan.” Twilight said. “It’s not as though I’ve got anything better to do...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“... And it all ends with me and Yugi duelling. It never ends more than a few days after that. Depending on how long Kaiba waits to start Battle City, and if we skip some events, our loop should last between a year or two. Now, do you have any questions?”</p><p class="double">Twilight had a few, but rattled them off at such speed, Yami couldn’t catch a single word of them.</p><p class="double">“Could you say that again, but slower?”</p><p class="double">“Sorry about that. Alright, my first question – what happens if I lose one of these ‘Shadow games’ when I’m not, so to speak, supposed to?”</p><p class="double">“As I understand it, either the loop will be over for you, or you’ll wake up when we free you. It all depends on how this loop works. Nothing worse than leaving the loop prematurely should happen though.”</p><p class="double">“OK. And what do we do if we have to duel each other?”</p><p class="double">“Whoever wins, wins. Although, we can ignore the ante rule if we fight in Battle City, if you want.”</p><p class="double">“That seems a little unfair. We can decide if and when that comes up. Now, about Serenity, the loops seem to have combined her with my, for lack of an actual term, daughter. Is there any way we can go see her earlier than you do in the baseline?”</p><p class="double">Yami frowned. “I’m afraid I’m not sure. Even when Joey is awake before duelist Kingdom, he leaves things as usual. He is always certain he can get the money, so he usually waits until he returns. Although, I think a large part of that is that Serenity is not yet Looping. Tell me, has Nyx Looped before?”</p><p class="double">“A fair amount.”</p><p class="double">“And do you think she could handle her situation?”</p><p class="double">“I think she’d be a lot happier if I were there, whether she could or couldn’t.”</p><p class="double">Yami looked at his calendar, and checked the dates.</p><p class="double">“We have two weeks until the chain of events for duelist Kingdom begin. You should be able to visit her sometime between now and then. Let me or Yugi know if you want anyone to come with you, but I understand if you want to visit her alone.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, last one for now. How did Joey get his Red Eyes back?”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm?” Yami placed the last storage box from his subspace pocket on the table.</p><p class="double">“Well, you beat that Rare Hunter and got Joey’s card back. But he didn’t take it. Then he was using it again the next time you talked about him. How did he get it?”</p><p class="double">“It appears I left out something important.” Yami smiled, as he sat at the table across from Twilight. “After Battle City finished, Joey and I had one last Duel. If he won, he would get his Red Eyes back. I saw it a different way, though...”</p><p class="double">“What do you mean?” Twilight asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p class="double">“Well, Joey should have beaten Marik. He even played a card that would have won the duel, and Marik had no way to stop it. He just couldn’t take the strain. So, when we met, I duelled him like it was the REAL Battle City final.”</p><p class="double">“Wait. Time out” Twilight held her head in one hand, the other indicating she needed a minute. After a short pause, she continued &quot;From what you’ve told me, approximately 75% of his ‘strategy’ is rolling dice or flipping coins, while you had the strongest cards to have ever been made. And you’re telling me that, if he had just stayed conscious for ten more seconds, he would have won that final?”</p><p class="double">“Not exactly.” Yami replied, a small smile spreading across his face. “The heart of the cards works in strange ways, Twilight. When the fate of the World is on the line, or even just a championship title, then perhaps it would have not favoured Joey. But, when the Duel is about nothing more than reuniting lost friends...”</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at him for a few seconds. Her response was fairly quiet when it came. “I can’t actually argue with that.”</p><p class="double">“Just as well. It took me longer than expected to explain everything.” Yami rose from his chair. “Here is every legal card that has ever existed in Duel Monsters, or ever will.” He swept his arm to indicate all of the labelled storage crates. “Now most duelists have an overarching theme, or a cornerstone monster. Kaiba has his girlfr... I mean Blue Eyed dragon. Joey has his luck cards and warriors. Some people use a large amount of traps or magic cards. It all depends on the person. All we need as a start point are some interests of you...”</p><p class="double">“Books and Magic.” Twilight said before he could finish the obvious question. “I have quite a few other hobbies, but they’re the things I’m involved with most.”</p><p class="double">“That... That is actually a good starting point.” Yami began searching through one of the boxes, labelled ‘Spellcasters’, before pulling out a small group of cards. “Yes, the Prophecy monsters. They are designed to work with a series of magic cards, but I can’t see that box, so they will have to wait. Take a look at their effects.”</p><p class="double">“’Spellbook’? Interesting idea. But I think I’ll need more than just these.” Twilight said, before taking cards out at random from the box. Most were placed to one side, but she began to stack those she found interesting next to the Prophecy cards Yami had picked out.</p><p class="double">Yami then replaced the spellcaster box with the magic card box, and the process repeated.</p><p class="double"></p><p>After almost an hours searching, and whittling down, Twilight had a deck.</p><p class="double">However, Yami noted one thing seemed to be aggravating her.</p><p class="double">“Arrgh, no, no, no, NO!” She yelled, throwing a handful of cards into the air. “Why can’t I find anything for that last slot?”</p><p class="double">“I have said the number of cards can vary Twilight. It doesn’t matter that you only have 59, it’s still a legal deck.”</p><p class="double">“But it’s not a round number!” She said, eagerly ripping the lid off the spellcaster crate, and rummaging through for the third time in five minutes.</p><p class="double"><i>Well, it looks like we have a Looper with OCD, Yugi</i> Yami thought, as he waited for Twilight to calm down</p><p class="double"><i>If she has OCD, why is she making such a mess?</i> Yugi quipped, before continuing <i>Actually, I have an idea. Do you remember our first ‘Duel Academy’ loop?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Somewhat. Wait, are you really suggesting we give her one of our decks cards? We only have so many Spellcasters she could actually use...</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m not suggesting one of the actual Dark Magicians. But there is one monster in our deck that would probably serve her better than us...</i></p><p class="double"><i>Which one is tha...Oh, yes. That might actually work.</i></p><p class="double">Yami exited his and Yugi’s shared thoughts to find Twilight still searching the boxes desperately.</p><p class="double">“Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Maybe what I should use is another trap. I only have a few.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight.” Yami repeated, a little louder.</p><p class="double">“No, that would throw the balance off. It has to be a monster.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight!”</p><p class="double">Twilight dropped the box of cards she had just lifted up, spilling the contents everywhere.</p><p class="double">“Oh no, I’m sorry. I’ll get it don’t worry.”</p><p class="double">“Leave it for a moment, I’ll help you. I have something for you.”</p><p class="double">“Huh? How could you have gotten something for me? You’ve been standing there staring into space for the last minute.”</p><p class="double">“No I ha... No, that doesn’t matter. It seems that having 60 cards is important to you.” Yami took his deck out of his holder. “And you said you need it to be a monster. I think this would fit in your deck rather well.”</p><p>He passed the card over to her.</p><p class="double">“’Magician’s Valkyria’? What makes you think this would fit in well?”</p><p class="double">“Two things. Firstly, it has an effect you’ll appreciate.”</p><p class="double">“’Your opponent cannot target face-up Spellcaster-Type monsters for attacks, except this one’.” Twilight looked up from the card. “Well, that is useful, but wouldn’t it be just as useful for you?”</p><p class="double">“You have nothing but Spellcasters in your deck. I do have a few other things. Besides, the second reason is this.”</p><p>Yami searched through his deck again, producing the Dark Magician Girl “They aren’t linked, but they do seem similar. When I met the anchor of a loop linked to mine, I gave him a card that seemed linked to mine. I only felt it right to do the same here.</p><p class="double"><i>A-hem </i>Yugi “coughed” inside the pairs shared mind.</p><p class="double"><i>It is technically true. Just stretching the definition of ‘I’ a little...</i></p><p class="double">“Thank you. That’s a really nice gesture.” Twilight said, placing the card on the top of her new deck. She did a recount, to be sure she had a full 60. Satisfied, she breathed a sigh of relief, and sat at the table as Yami replaced the crates into his subspace pocket. “Now what should we do?”</p><p class="double">Yami glanced at the clock. “Now we have a test run.” He slid a card into his deck to replace his lost card, and offered it over to Twilight for her to shuffle. Once the decks were given back to their owners, they began to draw.</p><p class="double">Yami smiled, as he looked over to Twilight. “Let’s Duel.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.4 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;The Blue Flu, you say?&quot;</p><p class="double">The first Lonely Loop Twilight had been through with this expansion, she&#039;d required a trip to the dentist to cap the teeth she&#039;d worn down from grinding. She&#039;d been plotting her next encounter with this little... incident... ever since.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, my, yes,&quot; Discord said. &quot;And it&#039;s left me a complete wreck!&quot; The draconequus bounced back swiftly from the anachronistic Studebaker that fell out of the sky onto him. &quot;And with Fluttershy gone, and with Applejack and Rarity having contracted my malady... I have only you, Princess Twilight Sparkle, to turn to for help.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m sorry, Discord,&quot; Twlight said, not sorry in the least, &quot;but there&#039;s nothing I can do to help you. But,&quot; and her grin grew even wider, &quot;I know someone who knows every home remedy ever devised by pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What, you mean that Zecora mare?&quot; Discord looked a bit discomfited. &quot;No offense, but I&#039;m not into that voodoo that she do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no,&quot; Twilight said, her horn flaring to life. &quot;Someone better even than her!&quot;</p><p class="double">The flash of teleportation faded to reveal the farmyard of Sweet Apple Acres, now with the addition of Twilight, Cadence and the distempered Discord. Ignoring Discord&#039;s questions, Twilight went to the front door and knocked. A few moments later, Granny Smith opened the door. &quot;Why, howdy there, Twilight,&quot; the Apple family matron grinned, &quot;what can I do for ya?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I have a... friend... here who has something called the Blue Flu,&quot; Twilight said, giving Granny a broad wink. &quot;You know all sorts of remedies, so you were the first pony I thought of.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ain&#039;t never heard of no blue flu,&quot; Granny said. &quot;Swine flu, pine flu, mine flu, and pinot noir wine flu, but never no blue flu. Lemme have a look at him.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord tried to back away from the advancing green mare, only to find his retreat blocked by Cadence&#039;s health shield. &quot;Really, madam, all I need is some bed rest and perhaps a little glass of water.&quot;</p><p class="double">Granny closed one eye and looked Discord up and down with the other. &quot;Naw,&quot; she said. &quot;A li&#039;l glass o&#039;water won&#039;t do you no good a&#039;tall. What we got here is a clear case of th&#039; colic. For that ya need a LOT of water.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord shrugged. &quot;Well, so long as it&#039;s sparkling mineral water. Ordinary tap water has such a flat taste.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Where it&#039;s gonna go,&quot; Granny said, &quot;you ain&#039;t gonna taste nothin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">For a moment Discord looked confused. Then his mismatched yellow and red eyes bulged wide open. &quot;You don&#039;t mean...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;BIG MAC!&quot; Granny shouted. &quot;Fetch me th&#039; garden hose!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eyup!&quot; To Discord&#039;s ears the heavy tramp of the farm horse&#039;s hooves were the tramp of doom.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry,&quot; Granny grinned, showing her one good tooth. &quot;Once we got ya cleaned out, you&#039;ll feel like a new... new... well, whatever y&#039;are, you&#039;ll feel like a new&#039;un.&quot;</p><p class="double">Almost instantly Discord&#039;s color changed from solid blue back to the normally abnormal mish-mash. He pulled a straw traveling hat out of nowhere and said, &quot;SuddenlyI&#039;mfeelingsomuchbetter- -musthavebeenoneofthosetwentyfourminuteviruses- -thankssomuchcan&#039;tstaygivemylovetoFluttershy TA!&quot;</p><p class="double">And that, in a puff of smoke, was that.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Twilight smiled, turning to Cadence. &quot;Shall we get back to the Starswirl exhibit? Did you know they have the bells he was wearing when he first demonstrated the amniomorphic spell?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.5 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight and Trixie weren&#039;t the only ponies who had uncomfortable awakenings. While Twilight awoke mid-stride and Trixie awoke stumbling over a rock in the road with her wagon in tow, Applejack often awoke just as an apple fell from one of her apple trees. It meant things would be pretty close to baseline. When she awoke without an aching head, she knew this would a weird one. Moments later, however, she was tackled by a frantic seapony Lyra Heartstrings who asked, &quot;Have you seen any ponies around here? Imagine, the hooves, the smooth hooves and all you can do with them!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack&#039;s eyes shrunk to pinpricks in terror. She tried to push the seapony away, only for her to notice her hooves had been replaced with fins...oh and she was a seapony too. It was just too much for the poor seapony as she screamed to the bottom of the landmass above.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie was unsure how to feel about this. On the one side, she was princess of Seaquestria and still had her horn (which meant she could use magic). But she wasn&#039;t sure how she felt about being a seapony. The ringing of the bells over the main doorway called her attention to what she was doing, having daylight court. After the doors creaked open, a Pink Seapony swam to the throne, &quot;Princess Trixie, I need your guidance.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie bellowed, &quot;The Greatest and Most Powerful Princess Trixie will assist you in any way she can, Pinkie Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped, &quot;You even know my name when I didn&#039;t say it yet, truly you are the greatest princess!&quot;</p><p class="double">Obviously, Pinkie was not awake, &quot;Of course, I know all my subjects. Now tell you me your desire.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie paused for a second, then asked, &quot;I wish to have more spectacular explosions for the Day of Danger, but no matter what I try, I can only get bigger explosions and a wider color range. I want something no one has ever seen before!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s eyes widened and started shinning, &quot;Explosions are my Forte!&quot;</p><p class="double">She drew on her memories as she flourished her cape, &quot;For it was I, Princess Trixie who used explosions to seal away my eternal rival and explosion fun killer, The Twilight Queen, into the island floating above our kingdom a thousand years ago. I will now teach you the methods of implosion, that will cause beautiful tidal currents and can drag entire land masses together!&quot;</p><p class="double">Now it was Pinkie&#039;s eyes that were shining, &quot;All hail Princess Trixie, she who shields us from the deadly shockwaves of our beloved explosions!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>This was the greatest loop ever, </i>thought Trixie as she basked in the admiration of her loyal subject.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>This is the worst loop ever, </i>moaned Applejack mentally after she managed to placate seapony Lyra. Unfortunately, the only way to placate Lyra was to promise to help her find the fabled earth ponies.</p><p class="double">Twilight was nowhere in the seapony equivalent of Ponyville. Instead, she had run into Sealestia running the town&#039;s library (which only confused her more since water tended to ruin books, but then just shrugged and put it down to magic or something). It only got worse when her memories returned and she realized she was responsible for providing food for the Day of Danger celebration. Dash would love this.</p><p class="double">After thinking of Dash, she summoned her element and pinged the other elements. Two elements of magic resonated (Trixie and Twilight) along with an element of Loyalty (either Dash or Spike). At least she wasn&#039;t alone in this madness. Of course, she couldn&#039;t think too much on that, considering Lyra was still ranting in her ear about earth ponies. Her eyes landed on Sealestia, which brought a new thought to mind. She held up a fin to stop Lyra and asked, &quot;Do you have anything on the Day of Danger and its origins?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sealestia nodded, &quot;Why yes! Let me get the book...&quot;</p><p class="double">Seconds later, she returned with a book, <u><b>The Sealed Queen</b></u>, which talked about the Twilight Queen was was sealed in the landmass hovering over the kingdom of Seaquestria by Princess Trixie a thousand years ago. Then, she got an evil idea and turned to Lyra. &quot;Say, Lyra, how good are you at explosions?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After several minutes of being regaled on how powerful an explosion she could produce (causing Applejack to feel nauseous), Applejack suggested they create an explosion big enough to reach the surface and which could be seen throughout Seaquestria. Lyra&#039;s eyes shone brightly. It was evening by the time to explosive was finished and the fireworks would soon go off.</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed in relief that it was almost over as she and Lyra added to the explosive managery. With that, Applejack finally succumbed to her inborn fear of seaponies and hid under her bed, barely managing to give Lyra the slip. She wasn&#039;t going to come out for the rest of the week, since they had just created the equivalent of a bunker buster nuke. She ascended into a seapony alicorn with additional fins allowing for faster swimming and a horn, then waited. She added one bit to Lyra&#039;s firework, sparklers that could be seen for miles away that would shoot off as it spins. She faced the single window in her room, conveniently aimed to where the fireworks had started shooting off several minutes ago.</p><p class="double">Their firework went off, shooting through the ocean like a missile towards the landmass above. With that, she called on her magic and surrounded Seaquestria in an orange bubble.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie looked around her as the shield came up. Her demeanor turned sour since they could no longer shoot off vast explosions. Immediately, she called for her guard to start looking for the pony responsible. It was a few seconds later that the spinning firework slammed into the landmass. It drilled its way halfway to the surface, then detonated spectacularly.</p><p class="double">Shockwaves and a rolling wave of fire slammed into the orange shield, but the shield held perfectly. The landmass above cracked, then started breaking apart, huge island size chunks started dropping towards Seaquestria, to Trixie&#039;s horror. Then, the landmass glowed brilliant purple and started reforming itself, except in one area which exploded outwards, allowing a single purple seapony alicorn to escape. Her eyes glowed white as she approached ponyville.</p><p class="double">Trixie gulped, and wondered if Twilight would be angry for things she did while asleep.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.6 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double">&quot;And tonight&#039;s first contestant is a lady of mystery, seventeen year old Sweetie Belle. Recently arrived in the UK, she&#039;s been working as a shop assistant in a fashion boutique. But now she&#039;s dressed to impress and ready to try and convince our Coaches to take her out of the high street and into the big time!&quot;</p><p class="double">VT Sequence (Sweetie): &quot;My big sister Rarity is a fashion designer back in my old home country, so I know my way around a boutique. I can&#039;t go back there at the moment, but I&#039;m travelling around, making the best of things. I&#039;ve tried a number of other jobs, but singing has always been my first love. I&#039;m hoping that I can show that love tonight on the Voice, and make my family proud, even if they can&#039;t be here tonight.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So will our young wanderer have a chance to settle down? Let&#039;s find out tonight, on The Voice.&quot;</p><p class="double">All four coaches heard the contestant step out onto the stage. The sound was loud, as if she was wearing tap shoes. There were a few gasps from the audience, and looks of astonishment, but how she looked wasn&#039;t important. It was her singing that mattered, though the first contestant always had the hardest sell. No matter how good they were, the tendency was to wait and see what the rest of the night would bring.</p><p class="double">Then she started singing &#039;Thousand Miles&#039; and it was pretty much a dead heat for the buttons. Her voice went right through them like a laser and cut loose any reservations they had about picking the first singer that came along. They didn&#039;t know what they expected to see, but a white unicorn pony in a simple lilac dress that matched her mane and tail wasn&#039;t it. However, they were all held transfixed by her incredible singing voice.</p><p class="double">As the last note died away all the Coaches started to speak at once, along with most of the audience. After a moment Sweetie Belle fired a bolt from her horn that flew straight up and flashed like a firework. &quot;Please, please, every-pony... body calm down! I know this must come as a surprise, but I&#039;m just here to compete like everyone else. Um... could you all ask questions one at a time? Mr Will I am?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoo... I&#039;m seeing it, but I don&#039;t quite believe it! Where&#039;s the original singer?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am... I have been. Ever since I arrived here in this country, this world, I&#039;ve been running a perception filter spell a really smart unicorn called Twilight taught me. It let people see me and interact with me without noticing I was a unicorn. I didn&#039;t want people freaking out. It also kind of helped me fit in, stopped people asking to many questions about my past.&quot; She gave her most winning smile and Kylie Minogue sqeeeed.</p><p class="double">&quot;How come we can see you now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I dropped the spell when I came on stage. This is the one place where my voice is more important than what I look like. I hated having to hide who I am. Hopefully now I won&#039;t have to.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So where do you come from, and how did you end up here?&quot; Tom Jones had recovered slightly slower than the others, but he was enough of a trooper to come back swinging when he did.</p><p class="double">&quot;Milton Keynes and by train.&quot; Sweetie Belle giggled, then said, &quot;Sorry, I couldn&#039;t resist. Originally I&#039;m from a land called Equestria where talking magical ponies are the norm. What I said about my sister was true, this is a copy of one of her designs. Unfortunately there are also creatures that aren&#039;t so nice. This ancient being of Chaos called Discord escaped from his stone prison and went on a rampage. I sort of got caught in the gears. Important safety tip, never tell an immortal prankster that you&#039;d rather be anywhere than near him.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You don&#039;t seem that unhappy about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I was a mess when I got here, but after I&#039;d cried myself out, I decided that I could either sit in a field and feel sorry for myself or try and make the best of it. So I cast a few spells to make myself unobtrusive and tried to fit in. Besides, I know once they&#039;ve dealt with Discord, my sister and her friends will come looking for me. Twilight Sparkle, the one who taught me magic is sort of the pony equivalent of a combination of Einstein and Merlin, with a side order of Dr Manhatten, so if any-pony can trace me, it&#039;s her, and that&#039;s before they bring in the princesses, who could probably go hoof to toe with any two deities you care to name.&quot;</p><p class="double">She shook her head. &quot;But until then, I&#039;ve got a singing career to kick start. So guys, who thinks they can help me achieve my full potential, and why?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Meteorite shards and shock glass lay scattered in the grass surrounding the steaming crater. A pair of pointed shoes stuck out over the rim. A pair of pointed shoes stuck out over the rim.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t you think that was a bit excessive?&quot; Twilight Sparkle asked Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Darling, I should think you&#039;d trust me by now to know an evil witch when I see one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, she had a gingerbread house, did she?&quot; the tall figure in black asked. &quot;Maybe invitin&#039; little children inside for a snack?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... no,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;What&#039;s evil about gingerbread houses?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There&#039;s nowt wrong with gingerbread in its proper place,&quot; the tall figure said quickly. &quot;But that place ain&#039;t in architecture, is what I&#039;m sayin&#039;.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think the Cakes would disagree with you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who&#039;re they? Witches?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... bakers. Their bakery and cake shop is shaped like a gingerbread house.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But not made out&#039;n actual gingerbread? Just one o&#039; them, wossname, simple acorns?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Simulacrum, and yes,&quot; Twilight chipped in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then that&#039;s allowed,&quot; the tall figure nodded. &quot;What about cacklin&#039;? She that is yonder,&quot; she pointed to the crater, &quot;did she cackle any?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You mean like, &#039;HeeheeHEEheeheeHEE!&#039; cackle?&quot; Rarity asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right. Nothin&#039; wrong with the occasional cackle, mind, providin&#039; you knows when to stop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, no, she didn&#039;t actually laugh like that,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;It was more like, &#039;Hah hah hah HAH hah hah hah hah.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm.&quot; The tall skinny human gave this careful consideration. &quot;Could be evil. Could also be somebody who didn&#039;t get the joke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, she was setting fire to half the forest, ranting about her plans for conquering the kingdom, and had a sled pulled by a hundred emaciated squirrels,&quot; Rarity said hotly. &quot;I should rather have thought her bona fides for being an evil witch had been quite firmly established!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;True, those are all def&#039;nite indications,&quot; the tall figure said. &quot;Still an&#039; all, this is Lancre, young... lady. This is witch country. An&#039; I have a, wossname, perfessional interest in seein&#039; to it that witches ain&#039;t killed just willy-nilly. Seein&#039; as I am, in fact, a witch.&quot;</p><p class="double">A short, fat, elderly figure climbed out of the crater, pointed hat appearing first, followed by the rest of her. &quot;S&#039;all right, Esme,&quot; she called out cheerfully. &quot;Nobody we know. Found a laundry tag from Quirm.&quot; She looked down at the shoes hanging over the rim and said, &quot;Y&#039;know, those might be my size.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well then,&quot; Granny Weatherwax said firmly, &quot;I s&#039;ppose we&#039;ll have to take your word for it. But I don&#039;t want you to go makin&#039; a habit of it! I can&#039;t be havin&#039; with strange talkin&#039; unicorns goin&#039; round killin&#039; witches at my time of life.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, ma&#039;am,&quot; Twilight said politely.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, quite,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;Now would you please remove these silver bridles? Or at least mine. On Twilight it works, but silver does clash with my coat so...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.8 (Crisis)</p><p class="double">Twilight had a recurring headache this Loop. A headache named Harry Hunsacker.</p><p class="double">To start with, she&#039;d Awoken as human police Lt. Twilight Foster, homicide detective, and later learned that she&#039;d replaced a man of the same rank and last name. Working on murder mysteries in what looked like the 1930s of the Hub – even if everything seemed oddly gray to her perception – had seemed like it might prove to be interesting. Then she&#039;d met Harry and the local Anchor.</p><p class="double">The Anchor was Nigel Grouse, Harry&#039;s best friend and paid-by-the-hour assistant. And boy did the man earn every penny. Nigel was possibly the only person who could put up with Harry Hunsacker on a daily basis, friend and generous pay or no. Harry had a childhood every bit as privileged as Diamond Tiara&#039;s, probably even more-so; an IQ equal to the average Prince Blueblood managed in the variants, possibly lower as it was clear the man was far from the brightest bulb on the strand; all the life skills, or rather lack of, the previous two traits implied; and the self-importance of Rainbow Dash at her worst. He ineptly bumbled into the cases she worked, irresponsibly wrecked anything resembling proper procedure, and yet still came out seeming like he&#039;d solved everything and actually <i>earned</i> that ludicrous self-made title of &#039;world famous detective and aspiring actor&#039;.</p><p class="double">The worst part of all? For all the migraine-inducing idiocy he pulled, he was impossible to hate. The man possessed less inherent malice than even Pinkie Pie. He not only genuinely wanted to help, he actually believed it was his duty (at least when a potential acting job wasn&#039;t on the line). Even more aggravating were the times he <i>was</i> helping despite appearances to the contrary.</p><p class="double">And he showed up at all of her important and high-profile cases. Without fail. Sometimes stumbling upon them while actively trying to get elsewhere. Heaven forbid she actually try to get away from him for a while. No matter where she went, he&#039;d end up going the same way by coincidences worthy of one of the Hub&#039;s B-movies. Which is what Twilight felt like she was stuck in. A series of B-movies.</p><p class="double">&quot;What medium does the Hub have you in?&quot; she managed to ask Nigel during a rare quiet moment where she could talk to him alone. &quot;I want to pick up a few copies in case I ever come back here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That might be a little difficult,&quot; Nigel looked apprehensive. &quot;The Hub has our Loop as a series of stage plays, &#039;living black and white&#039; they call them. They&#039;re not widely produced and the scripts have never been published for sale to my knowledge. Nor have any recordings been made of the productions.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared back at the man as she processed this. <i>&quot;Xylem.&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.9 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double">Minato and the others balked under the pressure as the Avatar continued to descend.</p><p>The world was ending, again. What they couldn&#039;t figure out was <i>why</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ryoji! What&#039;s wrong!? You don&#039;t <i>have</i> to do this! We&#039;ve done all this without summoning her <i>before!</i> What&#039;s wrong now!?&quot; Junpei shouted. He hadn&#039;t been looping long, in fact Ryoji had been looping longer, but that was the problem- a looping Ryoji could easily stop this. And he was Awake. Everyone was confused and afraid at what might be happening next.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>No.</b>&quot; The Avatar said in all of its voices. &quot;<b>The night must come. My mistress demands it.</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But <i>why-&quot; </i></p><p class="double">He was cut off by the huge shadow. &quot;<b>Enough. She is here.</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">The Avatar shuddered before a deeper, ominous and powerful voice flowed through it. &quot;<i><b>I AM NYX. I AM THE NIGHT. I AM COME.</b></i>&quot; The voice bellowed. &quot;<i><b>I HUNGER FOR YOUR SOULS, BUT A FITTING SUBSTITUTE WILL SUFFICE.</b></i>&quot;</p><p class="double">Oh, this couldn&#039;t be good.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>I.</b></i></p><p><i><b>DEMAND.</b></i></p><p><i><b>CUPCAKES.</b></i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;PFF- <i>really!?</i>&quot; Twilight snorted into her drink.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, <i>really!</i>&quot; The blue bat-pony Midnight Peaches, better known as Ryoji Mochizuki, asserted as he laughed.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you&#039;re telling me...&quot; She started, taking deep breaths to try and assuage her laughter. &quot;That my daughter spends one in every dozen loops or so as some neigh-unbeatable super-goddess in your loop, <i>demanding sweets</i>?&quot;</p><p class="double">The stallion nodded. &quot;It got old pretty fast, so we don&#039;t bother pranking the world with demands for sweets anymore, but yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare grinned. &quot;Oh, she is <i>never</i> living this down.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.10 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in a formless state and wondered what the heck she&#039;d ended up this time. Trying to look around her proved fruitless, so she went straight to examining her Loop memories.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Alright,&#039;</i> she thought to herself as speech didn&#039;t seem to be happening right now, <i>&#039;let&#039;s see who I am this HOLY SAP ON A BISCUIT!&#039;</i></p><p class="double">Twilight was reminded that she didn&#039;t currently possess a stomach when she was unable to expel its contents. She&#039;d... Apparently she&#039;d replaced Sombra this Loop. And if her Loop memories of turning the Crystal Empire into a conquering nation for the sole purpose of plundering and subsequently hoarding all knowledge on the planet were any indication, then she&#039;d been <i>far</i> too kind to the evil unicorn in her humiliations of him.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Okay, no going anywhere near the Crystal Empire this Loop, not even for a prank,&#039;</i> she vowed. <i>&#039;No wonder the crystal ponies tried to repress their memories of him.&#039;</i></p><p class="double">On the other hand, if a version of Sombra was in her place, or anyone else&#039;s for that matter, this Loop...</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;It&#039;s decided,&#039;</i> she mentally nodded, <i>&#039;I go find the local version of Sombra and if he&#039;s still an evil plothead then I haunt the bark out of him.&#039;</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It hadn&#039;t been hard to find this Loops&#039; Sombra. He&#039;d definitely taken her place as Celestia&#039;s student (which made her wonder about the perceptual powers of the local version of her mentor) complete with local Spike and position at the Ponyville Library. How he&#039;d managed to deal with Luna since she didn&#039;t sense that the Elements of Harmony were active was still a mystery.</p><p class="double">Staying out of sight was rather easy after she&#039;d figured out how to manipulated her shadowy form to be invisible. She was effectively a ghost unless she wished otherwise. And she&#039;d watched him very closely before deciding her course of action.</p><p class="double">He was quite the studious pupil in arcane matters and apparently had an affinity for using crystals to focus his spells. However, he made no studies into friendship, or even to socialize with the inhabitants of Ponyville beyond basic courtesy. He also kept his cutie mark covered at all times, even sleeping or bathing, which made Twilight suspicious about what it was.</p><p class="double">But what really sealed his fate was how he treated the local version of Spike. Twilight could freely admit that she was a harsh taskmaster on the dragonling, even before she started looping, but her demands were a five star vacation compared to Sombra&#039;s. Physical chores clearly beyond the dragonling&#039;s ability, reduced sleeping hours, meals withheld as punishment, and that wasn&#039;t even mentioning the generous emotional abuse and threats heaped on poor Spike whenever no one was watching.</p><p class="double">The only difference between this Sombra and the baseline was the lack of political authority.</p><p class="double">Twilight was going to torment him until the punishment of confessing every single crime he&#039;d ever committed would seem a mercy. And she was going to enjoy every moment after what she&#039;d watched him do to a version of her little brother and number one assistant. Making herself visible, she hovered over the currently sleeping form of Sombra menacingly, making sure to breathe loud and sinister much like Darth Vader did.</p><p class="double">Sombra eventually awoke, Twilight was quite patient, and his expression and near scream when he saw her was <i>very</i> satisfying. He let loose a few magic bursts, but even her current state was more than enough to render them pointless.</p><p class="double">&quot;W-what are you?&quot; he stuttered, trying to hide his fear of the unknown. &quot;What do you want?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned mentally. After dealing with so many crystal-obsessed versions of Sombra over the Loops, there was only one appropriate response to that.</p><p class="double">&quot;Booookssssss.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.11 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double">Twilight had to fight down a case of the giggles when she Awoke this time. She supposed she might have seemed like a madpony to Lyra, Twinkleshine and the others, but her Loop memories made her want to return for a relatively baseline loop with a minor variable she hadn&#039;t yet experienced.</p><p class="double">She couldn&#039;t help it, Shining Armor was replacing Spike this loop as a hero-worshipping LBBFF and he was adorable, blank flank and all.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shiny! Shiiiiny!&quot; She called as she threw the door open, crushing the inevitable present for a party she hadn&#039;t attended in hundreds of loops.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twileeeey!&quot; Shiny huffed as he levitated and waggled the poor battered teddy bear. &quot;I was going to give this to <i>Moondancer!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really, Shiny,&quot; Twilight scoffed, playfully mussing Shiny&#039;s mane like her baseline BBBFF had done to her so many times. &quot;I&#039;m afraid we&#039;ve got more important matters to deal with.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;D&#039;you wanna practice your &#039;Official Royal Guard Message Spell?&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do I?!&quot; Shiny bounced around the room while Twilight prepared her letter to Celestia.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie gasped and zoomed away. Twilight looked down at her brother. &quot;Well, <i>that</i> was interesting...&quot;</p><p class="double">Shiny had minor hearts in his eyes. &quot;That was the prettiest earth pony I&#039;ve ever seen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So, you&#039;ve got a thing for pink mares, hmmm?&quot; Twilight teased.</p><p class="double">Shiny began blushing hard enough he could be confused with the peppy party pony himself. &quot;S-shut up, Twileyy!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;B-beautiful....&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, the decorations are very well-done,&quot; Twilight began...</p><p class="double">&quot;Not those... <i>her!</i>&quot; Shiny pointed, and Twilight followed the gaze up... and found a delicate pink pegasus with purple edging to her feathers assisting Rarity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance, darling, thank you ever so much for helping me!&quot; The fashionista caroled with a familiar bit of fondness in her tone.</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem, sis!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. This loop was going to be so sweet. She was so glad she&#039;d perfected the memories to photographs spell long ago. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.12 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Rainbow Dash Awoke in the middle of taking a drink. She choked, coughed and sputtered as she dropped the glass back to the table in front of her. As she shook her head to clear it, a loud cheer and clapping went up around her.</p><p class="double">&quot;New Challenger!&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash looked around at the room/bar she was in. Several people, of varying races, sat at different tables dotted around the establishment. Many were talking and laughing, though there was a group by the back wall that were sitting on a row of chairs, looking completely blank faced.</p><p class="double">As Dash searched for Loop memories, a skinny man in green coveralls walked up to her. &quot;Hell-o. My name&#039;sa Luigi. Welcome to-a Super Smash Bros.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks. I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re a Looper?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, but-a not in this world. I don&#039;t think anyone is a Looper here. It is kind-a like the Eiken Loop, except-a whole lot better.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow froze at the mention of Eiken, then slowly relaxed. &quot;So, what&#039;s the deal here then?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We-a fight.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow blinked. &quot;Like, right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No no no. On the stages. A group of-a up to four people is-a picked, and then we are-a sent out to battlestages. They are-a like places we have-a been.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. So how do *BEEEEEEEP*</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Attention all Brawlers! A New Brawl is about to Commence.&quot; </i>A loud cheer went up from the people in the bar. <i>&quot;Rules are: 4 Stock, Full Items. Challenger 1: Link&quot;</i> One of the silent figures sitting against the wall vanished in a flash of light. <i>&quot;Challenger 2: Luigi&quot;</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s-a my cue.&quot; Luigi vanished in the flash of light as well. Dash backed up and looked around nervously.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Challenger 3: Ness&quot;</i> A short kid cheered a couple of tables over and then *Flash* he was gone. Then <i>&quot;Challenger 4: Rainbow Dash&quot;</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;What? I don&#039;t *Flash* know whaaa?&quot; Dash stagger slightly. She was standing on a small hovering platform. Some distance below, there was what looked like a large floating platform, with some smaller platforms arranged floating above it. Then the memories hit.</p><p class="double">They weren&#039;t memories in the usual sense, more like knowledge and muscle memory. In a few moments, they would make their entrance. After that, it would be basically a free-for-all. She glanced up at the 4 blue dots that were floating over her head, representing her lives.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Let&#039;s do this.&quot; Seconds later, the platform flashed, and her body <i>moved</i>. She dove down, a cloud forming above one of the smaller platforms in front of her. She broke through before landing with a flourish. Across from her, she could see the little kid Ness. The other two were out of sight, so they were probably on a lower platform.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Go!&quot;</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Dash jumped to the side to avoid yet another arrow. The tall guy in green, Link, was keeping his distance and just firing off arrows. Luigi and Ness were bouncing around on the upper platforms. Apparently, they had a score to settle.</p><p class="double">Tensing up, Dash lowered her body, before unleashing one of her special moves. Apparently, powers and subspace pockets were restricted while on the Battlefields. Instead, you got four special moves, and items randomly popped up all over the place. Releasing her charge, Dash shot forward with her Rainbow Dasher, leaving a rainbow colored trail behind her. Link leapt back, drawing his sword, and Dash jumped, passing over his strike and kicking him in the head. He fell back, and Dash only had a moment to realize he had dropped a bomb before it went off, knocking her skyward.</p><p class="double">Dash glided back down to one of the empty platforms. Her ability to fly was limited to flapping her wings and using her special Wing Jump skill. Kind of annoying, but she was awesome enough to handle it. Just as she was getting ready to jump back down to handle Link, a weird purple orb flew up through the ground in front of her. Her Loop instinct took over, and she spun around and kicked the ball, which shattered. Instantly she felt like she was supercharged withenergyandwowshefeltlikeshecoulddoanythinglikemaybea...</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>SONIC RAINBOOM</b></i>!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.13 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight woke up sitting, human style oddly enough, on a bench. According to her loop memories, she was Lyra Sparkle, and she had just been catching up with her old friend Bonnie. And it was the day before the Summer Sun Celebration.</p><p class="double">&quot;...And then I woke up, like I was in a time loop or something, you know what I mean?&quot; Bonnie was saying, as Twilight turned her attention back to the conversation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, I do know what you mean. So, we&#039;re Lyra and Bon-Bon this time?&quot; A quick ping showed the rest of the Mane Six were Awake... and a very odd response from Pinkie&#039;s Element.</p><p class="double">&quot;No you silly, I&#039;m Bonnie this time. There&#039;s also Bombe, Bon Suite, Bonelle, Bon-Bond, Bonita, Sweetie Drops, and Bon-Bon! Also, I&#039;m a mini-changeling hive this time. There&#039;s eight of me!&quot; The cheerful look on Pinkie&#039;s face was met by an almost terrified look on Twilight&#039;s.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The six of them had gathered in the Bon-basement of the Bon-house, while Pinkie&#039;s other seven Bons continued to prepare for the upcoming Celebration. Along the way, they had seen a baseline Pinkie &quot;greet&quot; a baseline Twilight and Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, so to surmise, I&#039;ve replaced Lyra, Rarity&#039;s replaced Minuette, Fluttershy&#039;s Roseluck, AJ&#039;s Raindrops, Rainbow&#039;s Ditzy, and we all know what Pinkie is. Anything that needs to be brought up, before we plan what to do this loop?&quot; The unusually green Twilight looked to her friends.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, Ah&#039;ve got one. Why d&#039;you got the name Sparkle, and why&#039;s Rainbow still got her usual mane and first name?&quot; Asked a distinctly non-apple pegesus, wearing one of her spare stetsons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m appearantly Twilight Sparkle&#039;s cousin. I&#039;m sure that&#039;ll come up sometime in the future. Rainbow?&quot; The ponies turned to look at the grey coated pegesus.</p><p class="double">&quot;Estranged elder sister, oddly enough. On a related note, remember how Ditzy is sometimes a single mom? Turns out Scoots is my daughter this time &#039;round.&quot; Rainbow Dew replied... looking at AJ with one eye, and the stairs out of the basement with the other. &quot;By the way, anything you can do about my eyes? It&#039;s interesting, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll see what I can do. Enchanted goggles, maybe. Anyway, anything else, or shall we get to planning?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.14 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain&#039;s Log: Stardate 2124.5...&quot; dictated Captain Rainbow T. Dash from the center chair as Commander Twilight Sparkle evaluated her Start-of-Loop situation from the Science Officer&#039;s station.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay...Not baseline loop...Definitely not Equestria...Trek variant...Looks like everypony&#039;s their usual shape too.</i> She glanced down to note her blue science branch tunic before returning her attention to the bridge. Constitution<i> class...too colorful to be any of the movies...Come to think of it, the uniform insignia badge probably makes it the </i>Enterprise<i> herself.</i> A quick check of her Loop memories confirmed her observations and deductions.</p><p class="double">Looking around the bridge, she noted Sweetie Belle at Communications and Apple Bloom at the Engineering monitor station.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo sat next to Nyx at the Helm and Navigation consoles respectively.</p><p class="double">And judging by the small nods of acknowledgement being exchanged by the CMC, it appeared that everypony on the bridge except Dash was Awake.</p><p class="double">&quot;...En route to the Beta...VI...Colony...&quot; continued the captain. Ah. There was the tell-tale hesitation indicating that Dash just awoke in mid-speech and was assimilating Loop memories. Twilight reviewed the captain&#039;s last sentence. <i>Why does Beta VI ring a bell?</i></p><p class="double">An insistent beep caught the unicorn&#039;s attention and she returned her scrutiny to the hooded sensor vi<i>ewer. There&#039;s something not quite right about this. It feels almost familiar</i>, she thought as she worked to interpret the readings. <i>Deal with the immediate situation for now. Worry about that nagging feeling later</i>, she decided.</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain. Sensors show an energy field approaching in excess of Warp 9. Bearing 28 mark 30,&quot; she reported, manipulating the controls to extract more data from the instruments. &quot;Exact nature of the field is indeterminate: The library computer has no matching records.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Field will intercept in approximately two minutes,&quot; added Nyx, checking the astrogation readouts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Unable to detect any communication attempts,&quot; chirped Sweetie. &quot;Continuing to monitor all frequencies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Helm, alter course twenty degrees to port,&quot; ordered Rainbow Dash. &quot;Broadcast our own hail, Lt. Belle.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twenty degrees to port, aye,&quot; acknowledged Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Attempting hail, Captain. Awaiting response,&quot; reported Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Unknown field is altering course to maintain intercept. Contact in one hundred seconds,&quot; announced Nyx.</p><p class="double">&quot;Engineering, can we outrun it?&quot; asked Rainbow.</p><p class="double">&quot;I kin give ya Warp 9 fer about half an hour, then we&#039;ll haveta drop back to Warp 6. Sorry, Cap&#039;n. Best I kin do with standard engines,&quot; apologized Apple Bloom. It would have taken her about a day to complete the first set of &quot;Apple Bloom Special&quot; upgrades. A complete refit would take about a week in spacedock.</p><p class="double">Having determined that the <i>Enterprise</i> was unable to evade the field, and that said field did not match any pattern in the Library computer, Dash decided to play it cautiously friendly. &quot;Drop us out of Warp. Yellow alert. Continue hails.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight had walked down next to the Captain&#039;s chair and murmured to Dash. &quot;I&#039;m almost certain I&#039;ve seen something very close to this in a previous Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus nodded. &quot;Yeah. Same here. Can&#039;t quite put my hoof on it...&quot;</p><p class="double">Then the ship was enveloped by a familiar tessellating barrier. Twilight and Rainbow exchanged a resigned look. <i>Oh. This again.</i></p><p class="double">An intruder appeared just to the left of the viewscreen in a flash of white light: A familiar male draconequus, dressed in a rough semblance of pre-Equestrian upper-class garb: Doublet, hose, ruffed collar, floppy hat with feather.</p><p class="double">Before he could launch into his first threat, he was greeted with a six-pony Synchronized Face-Hoof that would have been a strong contender for the unofficial Annual Starfleet Command Staff Exasperation Display competition.</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord, you&#039;re getting really sloppy,&quot; accused Rainbow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not to mention repetitive,&quot; added Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is the wrong <i>Enterprise</i>,&quot; pointed out Nyx.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yer off by about a century,&quot; contributed Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">Twilight had been consulting a PADD, and transferred the output to the main viewscreen. A stream of text and several images scrolled past. &quot;I think you&#039;re supposed to be playing Trelane this time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bah. One omnipotent being&#039;s so much like another,&quot; sulked Discord.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you&#039;re saying Q is just as childish as Trelane?&quot; snarked Sweetie.</p><p class="double">Discord held up his paws in surrender. &quot;Fine, fine. Shall we call this opening a bust and make it a vacation loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Works for me,&quot; decided Rainbow. Nods were shared around the bridge.</p><p class="double">&quot;So do you want to stick with us, or do you have other things you&#039;d like to do?&quot; Twilight asked the chaos spirit.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I&#039;ll drop in on the Continuum to play with my alter-ego. I&#039;ll try not to destroy the universe if things get rough.&quot; He vanished in his usual white flash before anypony could comment. The barrier around the ship also disappeared.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s reassuring,&quot; muttered Twilight as she went back to peering at her PADD. &quot;Hey, Rainbow. If we&#039;re going to play along and follow Starfleet&#039;s assignments, after we take care of our business on Beta VI, it looks like...Hm...Too bad Trixie&#039;s not here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;d have some ideas about improving that black-powder bamboo cannon you&#039;re supposed to use against the Gorn.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Meh. Lizard can&#039;t fly, so he isn&#039;t much of a threat.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">57.15 (Redshirt Zombie)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are we playing cards?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because Pinkie had a deck, and Discord is – as usual – late for the meetup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah.&quot;</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>58.1 (Hubris Plus)</p><p class="double">Chrysalis staggered into the reception area as she attempted to continue her &#039;evaluation&#039; of the wedding preparations. She honestly couldn&#039;t care less about any of it, it would all be wasted effort the moment she caged Celestia and coerced her darling groom into dropping the shield.</p><p class="double">But any deviation from her role could cause her to be discovered at an inopportune moment and bring the whole plan crashing down around her. So she played the part of the bride, drawing from countless lifetimes of playing the same subterfuge on a smaller scale. She couldn&#039;t claim more than a few of those experiences as her own, but the Hive remembered and the Swarm whispered its support.</p><p class="double">Well, it had been a whisper earlier that day. Now it was somewhere between enthusiastic shouting and companionable rambling. She should probably have been more concerned about that than she was, but at the moment she felt absolutely invincible.</p><p class="double">Even if she couldn&#039;t quite put one hoof in front of the other properly.</p><p class="double">She squinted as she surveyed the room. There was the pink one, setting up some kind of idiotic foal&#039;s game. She decided that she&#039;d deal with that in a moment, instead continuing her scan for the alicorn that was supposed to be working the bar.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d almost called off the entire plan when a fourth Princess had suddenly appeared in the aftermath of Discord&#039;s defeat, but her spies had tracked down everything on the mare easily enough. Years of drunk and disorderly conduct, no political or combat ability to speak of, and for the longest time ponies had thought her cutie mark was more for downing drinks than mixing them.</p><p class="double">Discord had obviously been a fluke, but that was no reason not to keep an eye out.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Ere yar,&quot; she slurred as she caught sight of her target and wobbled up to the counter. There was a black furred pony with a pale blue mane slumped on a stool nearby surrounded by glasses, and she let out a little involuntary giggle at the sight. It almost looked like a changeling, but that was silly. Changelings didn&#039;t look like changelings, that was the whole <i>point</i>.</p><p class="double">She frowned as she redirected her attention ahead and caught sight of herself in the mirror behind the bar. Her coat looked grimy, her mane was an absolute <i>mess</i>, and the look of wide eyed terror written across her features was completely out of character. Not to mention the way her reflection was backing away slowly while she stood still. Stupid mirror.</p><p class="double">&quot;You!&quot; She barked, pointing to the alicorn bartender, &quot;gimme one o&#039; those things you make.&quot; She grinned as a glass was slid in her direction and spent a moment trying to capture it in a wavering magical field before shrugging and gripping the rim in her teeth, titling her head back to down the contents.</p><p class="double"><i>Huh</i>, she thought to herself, <i>sideways isn&#039;t the way rooms usually are, right? And the floor looks a lot closer than it did a moment ago...</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">&quot;...So I told Celestia that I wanted to expand the palace wine cellar into the old crystal mines and &#039;found&#039; Cadance down there while poking around,&quot; Berry told Twilight as the pair watched the changeling queen get loaded onto a stretcher. She and the hundreds of swarm members who had conked out would be carted out past the shield, where a ring of several thousand similarly slumped insectoids still surrounded the city.</p><p class="double">It would be a logistical nightmare deporting the lot of them, but the invasion was definitely off.</p><p class="double">&quot;What I want to know,&quot; Twilight responded. &quot;Is how you got the effects to propagate over the whole swarm. Changeling biology is loaded with dozens of failsafes to prevent <i>exactly that</i> from happening.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, it wasn&#039;t that hard,&quot; Berry answered and smiled fondly as she recalled her daughter&#039;s adoring face at her coronation, and how the expression had lingered for days after. The pride and devotion that seemed to radiate off the filly in waves as she told anyone who would listen that her mother was a Princess.</p><p class="double">&quot;I just had to mix them with love.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Berry Punch had planned out her challenge Loop she&#039;d been pretty straight forward about it. In her experience, which in this area was exceptional even by Looper standards, enough alcohol would put anything down. Oh, she&#039;d had to get creative to get through the ridiculous tolerance of an alicorn and bypass Discord&#039;s bizarre pseudo-biology, but once she knew how to get them drunk it had just become a question of quantity.</p><p class="double">Sombra was no different. She&#039;d done a few trial runs against Nightmare Moon&#039;s insubstantial form and concocted an alcohol aerosol that could affect the ephemeral. The difference was that while the drunk alicorn would snap back into solidity as her concentration folded, Sombra&#039;s shade was held together by will and malice. Too inebriated to maintain the spell that held him together, he would disperse and fade into nothing.</p><p class="double">It was a better end than the monster deserved.</p><p class="double">It was a plan she discarded the instant she laid eyes upon the crystal ponies as she stepped into the empire alongside Cadance and Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">Her talent was for more than just brewing. She could size up a room, see who needed a drink, how much, what kind.</p><p class="double">The Crystal Empire? It needed one hell of a drink.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken every ounce of the credibility and influence that that Berry had acquired by besting three threats to Equestria and becoming a Princess to get a couple of the cars on the supply trains dedicated to bringing up her stills and ingredients. Between those, the Empire&#039;s own disused distillery, every speed brewing trick she knew, and the stores beneath the Crystal Palace (and she had to admit, for a megalomaniacal sociopath Sombra had damn fine taste) she was <i>just</i> able to pull it off.</p><p class="double">She observed the softly buzzing crowd for a moment, heart warming at the sight of a few hesitant smiles and the sound of gentle laughter as they sampled her elixir, before turning her attention back to her own glass. Light sparkled off of it, reflecting off the glimmering motes suspended within.</p><p class="double">Privately, she considered it one of her finest creations. Oh, she&#039;d brewed stronger, and sweeter, and just about every other superior adjective she could think of, but she&#039;d been attempting a singular purpose in making it and had achieved it magnificently.</p><p class="double">It was the sort of drink that pushed bad memories out of focus and made the good ones shine. The sort that would bring friends together in laughter and make them brave enough to stand up to anything. The sort that inspired ponies to buy a round, because drinking alone was out of the question.</p><p class="double">A hush fell over the crowd as Cadance&#039;s shield finally flickered out, the other Princess pushed beyond the limits of her power by the encroaching darkness. <i><b>&quot;Crystal Ponies,&quot;</b></i> a voice rumbled over the city. <i><b>&quot;</b></i><u><i><b>My</b><b> Crystal Ponies.&quot;</b></i></u></p><p class="double"><b>&quot;NOT ANYMORE, SOMBRA!&quot;</b> She called out, infusing the tone she reserved for rowdy patrons into the Royal Canterlot Voice, <b>&quot;AND NEVER AGAIN!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">A murmur swept across the gathered ponies, and they turned to face the dark cloud speeding down the street, but the moment of fear had passed.</p><p class="double">Possibly most importantly, it was the sort of drink that made you call your boss at three AM and tell him <i>exactly</i> what you thought of him.</p><p class="double">&quot;You ain&#039;t the boss o&#039; us!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We got <i>two</i> Princesses now, an&#039; you ain&#039;t worth the dirt on their horse shoes!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I&#039;m talkin&#039; to you, waddya gonna do &#039;bout it?&quot;</p><p class="double">A roar broke out and the cloud accelerated as it became enraged at the rebellious attitude of it&#039;s former subjects. Blinded by fury, it didn&#039;t see that the crowd seemed to glow a fraction brighter with every shout.</p><p class="double">Alone, the collective goodwill and camaraderie of the Empire would have been at most an irritant to the ancient dictator. Sombra was no windego, to be banished by joy and songs.</p><p class="double">Which was why Berry had added a dusting of spectrum gem to the batch. She hadn&#039;t really liked those tumblers anyways.</p><p class="double">For an instant, just as Sombra&#039;s malevolent aura gathered above them, the square was filled with such brilliant light that ponies could barely make out those standing next to them and the reflective crystals of the city&#039;s buildings lit up like Hearth&#039;s Warming lights. When they faded, the only sign of the dark wizard was the smoking crown that rolled to stop at Berry&#039;s hooves. A stunned silence fell over the assembled ponies as she lifted it in her magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Usually, hats go in the lost and found,&quot; she said as she considered it. With a shrug she tossed if over her shoulder. &quot;But I don&#039;t think he&#039;s coming back.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd burst into cheers as it landed in a trash bin, and Berry smiled wide as the party got back into swing.</p><p class="double">She&#039;d take happy customers over conked out villains any day.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.2 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon trudged through the Everfree Forest, tired but wary as she followed the map that Miss Twilight had given her of the safest path to Miss Zecora&#039;s hut. This loop she was a Zebra filly, with silver stripes instead of black ones and a weird Zebra cutie mark that only vaguely resembled her spoon.</p><p class="double">Traveling to Equestria hadn&#039;t been easy, although the option to come to Ponyville at the speed of Sonic Rainboom had been available. Something about a visiting looper who was in a bad state. But since none of the other fillies her age were Awake, and Silver Spoon figured what she&#039;d learned so far in medical alchemy would be foal&#039;s play to the stuff Miss Twilight and the others could do, she&#039;d turned down the offer.</p><p class="double">It was a decision her sore hooves were <i>really</i> regretting at the moment, but after almost two months of nonstop travel it was finally almost - !</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon squealed as <i>something</i> closed around her back hoof and yanked her into the air. Her hooves flailed wildly for a good minute before she realized that it wasn&#039;t a monster looking for a filly-sized snack that had gotten her. No, the culprit was a simple snare, and now Silver Spoon was dangling from a tree like a piece of fruit. Still, it was just a regular piece of rope, and it only took the filly a few minutes of really awkward wiggling around before she could transmute one of her bracelets into a knife to cut the rope with.</p><p class="double">Miss Twilight hadn&#039;t said anything about traps, but after thinking about it made sense to Silver Spoon. Anypony who lived in a big, scary, monster-filled place like the Everfree Forest would want to set up defenses against being gobbled up. It made perfect sense. Silver Spoon kept thinking that until she landed back on the forest floor - and shrieked as the rope snare hidden <i>underneath</i> the first snare promptly hauled her back into the air.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;My apologies for the lack of warning,&quot; Miss Zecora said as she poured a cup of tea for the bedraggled filly that had finally made it to her hut, &quot;Though I disarmed all the traps my guest laid this morning. I thought he spend the day in meditation, but instead he practiced his trap replication.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon glared daggers at the door to Miss Zecora&#039;s hut. After she&#039;d cut herself down from the second snare, the rest of the trail had been filled with pit traps, tripwires rigged to drop nasty things on her, and other things disguised as traps to trick her into falling into all the <i>real</i> traps.</p><p class="double">She had only gotten a glimpse of the offender: a regular pony with a silver mane like hers. Miss Zecora had said something to him that Silver Spoon hadn&#039;t heard clearly, though it sounded like she was scolding him, and the pony had disappeared into the trees without a reply.</p><p class="double">It turned out <i>this</i> was the looper everypony had been worried about back when the loop started. As Silver Spoon had thought, they hadn&#039;t needed her help with that after all. But he was supposed to be staying with Miss Zecora so he could rest, meditate, and work on healing his mind after whatever happened (Miss Zecora had given Silver Spoon a <i>look</i> that told her she <i>really</i> didn&#039;t want to know what that was).</p><p class="double">Instead he was trapping the forest in a mile radius around Miss Zecora&#039;s house and patrolling like he expected to be attacked by all the monsters in Tartarus any second.</p><p class="double">&quot;The words &#039;paranoid&#039; and &#039;ninja&#039; are often synonymous, but this behavior is certainly anomalous,&quot; Miss Zecora added, &quot;My words he once heeded, but of late no longer. I fear his defenses against others will only grow stronger.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon spent three uncomfortable days thinking about what was going on. Miss Zecora had told her that Kakashi was a new looper too, and she could definitely empathize with suddenly looping and finding out how everypony you thought you knew so well were like completely different ponies.</p><p class="double">But after three days, Silver Spoon had had enough of the tense atmosphere surrounding Miss Zecora&#039;s hut. Time and again, she saw Miss Zecora try to offer help to the guest looper, and every time she was being ignored. Some how, some way, Silver Spoon was determined to do something about this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Silver Spoon called up into the tree where she could see Kakashi lurking today, &quot;Can you come down here for a second? I need to talk to you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Much to her surprise, he did so. But the cool indifferent gaze in his eye - the other was closed for some reason - made her nervous.</p><p class="double">&quot;...W-Well, Miss Zecora said you&#039;re a new looper,&quot; Silver Spoon managed, &quot;I just started looping recently too. I was wondering...if you wanted to talk about it - &quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that curt reply, the ninja pony returned to his tree. Silver Spoon gaped, surprised at getting such a rude response.</p><p class="double">And then she got mad.</p><p class="double">So, Kakashi didn&#039;t want to do this the <i>Pony</i> way, did he?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon was sprawled out on her stomach, panting hard. Not far away was Kakashi, who had managed to sit up for a few seconds before he gave up and flopped over on his side. Both of them were also covered in a mix of mud, twigs, and tree sap, and the crater they were lying in was full of torn-up trees and broken pieces of giant spoons.</p><p class="double">At some point during the fight he&#039;d set her mane on fire. She&#039;d retaliated by giving him a black eye over his Sharingan.</p><p class="double">And ten seconds after both of them had fallen over from exhaustion, they&#039;d started <i>laughing</i>.</p><p class="double">Now they were chatting amicably, while Miss Zecora (who had made some disapproving noises but was otherwise smiling quite a bit herself) got to work growing new trees to fill in what had once been one of the densest, darkest parts of the Everfree Forest.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t very long before a frantic Naruto and Miss Twilight arrived on the scene.</p><p class="double">&quot; - must be awkward, being different species all the time,&quot; Kakashi was saying as they arrived.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, but I do like learning new languages,&quot; Silver Spoon admitted before realizing they had an audience.</p><p class="double">Kakashi tried sitting up again, failed miserably, and settled for weakly waving a hoof before Naruto latched onto him in a hug.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Sorry I&#039;m late.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a pause.</p><p class="double">&quot;I was busy fighting a baby zebra, but I eventually won.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Liar,&quot; Silver Spoon giggled. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.3 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double">&quot;This is a sad day.&quot; Twilight began, the mood among all present somber. &quot;Rainbow Dash is gone.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sad music began playing in the background.</p><p class="double">&quot;But she leaves us with the gift of knowledge. The knowledge that if you try to repeatedly buck Discord in a Trek Loop as Q for a particularly irritating pun he made, he <i>will</i> teleport you somewhere incredibly inconvenient, if humorous. So as we remember her, we also wish her a safe journey in her new home somewhere in the distant Pegasus Galaxy. We shall remember her fondly, and then remind her why that was stupid next loop.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;THE NIGHT! WILL LAST! FOREVER!&quot; Nightmare Moon spread her wings and began to cackle--</p><p class="double">--only for a white furry foot to smack her in the face and send her sprawling.</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; The dazed alicorn blinked, shaking her head as she searched for her assailant. &quot;Who dares to--?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel Bunny pulled out a carrot twice his size, gave it a brief nibble, then took up a fencing position.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight tapped her parchment. &quot;Well... I don&#039;t know if this is cheating or not. Technically, ninjitsu and fencing are two disparate art forms, but you didn&#039;t use any magic... I&#039;ll let you have this one, but I&#039;m going to see what Luna thinks next time she&#039;s awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">The rabbit shrugged, waggling a paw.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I know. So, what&#039;s your plan for Discord?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight would later reflect that such a large smile on such a small face was downright disturbing. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.5 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Once there were two sisters, ponies with immense magical powers, who ruled over all Equestria.</p><p class="double">One ruled the heavens, raising the sun and moon in their proper time, setting the stars in their places, and ordering the seasons each in their place.</p><p class="double">The other did all the paperwork, ensuring that disputes among the ponies were settled fairly and justly.</p><p class="double">But while the ponies loved the elder sister and her beautiful sky, they laughed and mocked the younger sister, saying they could not take seriously a mare with magically glowing pink hair.</p><p class="double">The younger mare&#039;s sadness and jealousy grew into rage, until eventually her heart turned black and evil. She rebelled against her sister, refusing to do any more paperwork, and ensnarling the land in a sea of red tape.</p><p class="double">With great reluctance the elder sister wielded the strongest force in Equestria, the Elements of Harmony, and banished her to the moon, where she remains to this day.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s the story of the Mayor in the Moon,&quot; Twilight said, closing the book.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s kinda sad,&quot; Applebloom said. &quot;Is the younger princess ever coming back?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, actually the spell ran out two years ago. Celestia tells me she refuses to come down until someone invents a hair dye that&#039;ll work on an alicorn mane,&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">Or until the Loop ends, she added to herself, but since none of the colts and fillies present were Awake she didn&#039;t say so out loud.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>And on the moon, Ivory Scroll worked on her five hundred forty-seven thousand, three hundred and sixty-second draft of her attempt at a comprehensive constitution for the principality of Equestria. (A thousand words or less was her goal; her best effort had been 1,326, but the loopholes had been too large.)</p><p class="double"><i>Never, never, never again</i>, Ivory Scroll thought. <i>If I can&#039;t look distinguished as a princess, then I don&#039;t want any. NEVER again. </i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">58.6 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke in darkness, her loop memories incredibly hazy where they existed at all.</p><p class="double"><i>Pines. I hope I&#039;m not dead again.</i></p><p class="double">She <i>could</i> feel things, though, rattling about with her as whatever she was in rocked from side to side. There was a sudden jolt, a hiss of steam, and with an oddly metallic pop her world was invaded by light. Before she could process anything she was upended and dumped unceremoniously on a sandy beach. Her violet eyes blinked away the blindness of the sudden sun, before shifting from side to side to determine what the heck was going on.</p><p class="double">Beside her lay an orange bundle of cables, muscle, armor, and pistons. It took her a moment, but her loop memories eventually identified the thing as her arm.</p><p class="double">And come to think of it, she couldn&#039;t feel her neck.</p><p class="double">Actually, she <i>could,</i> but it was lying some distance away.</p><p class="double"><i>...I will not panic. All my bits are here. I just have to pull myself together. Literally.</i> Twilight sighed as she began to mentally command her disparate body parts. <i>Bloom will love hearing about this...</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Fluttershy swam quietly through the bay, mossgreen eyes glowing as she studied the patterns of the fish around her. Her loop memories consisted of her name and half-remembered fragments... training? She couldn&#039;t tell. Still, she could <i>feel</i> the water around her in an almost instinctive way, as though... as though she was a part of it, as though it were another limb.</p><p class="double">Up ahead was a large patch of kelp, the long green fronds obscuring whatever was behind it. She gripped one of her hooks and pushed the kelp away, peering at the odd green pillars beyond. Swimming closer, she brushed her metallic blue hands against the surface of one and considered its plantlike texture. Her eyes went up to the dark circle on the surface.</p><p class="double"><i>Time to meet the natives, I guess...</i></p><p class="double">She darted up, bursting out of the water and landing on an extremely large lily pad. Gasps of shock and terror meat her ears, and she looked up to see miniature blue robots with masks backing away from her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Enough!&quot; One of the robots, wearing a strange robe and wielding a trident of bone, stepped forward and smiled. &quot;This is no monster, but a hero!&quot; She inclined her head slightly. &quot;It is good to see you Awake, Toa. I am Turaga Cheerkama, leader of Ga-Koro.&quot;</p><p class="double">The taller robot knelt. &quot;And I am Gautershy, though I remember little else before my Awakening. I would be glad to find any Anchor of knowledge in this realm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Knowledge I have, though an Anchor escapes me. Come, let me tell you our tale...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ivnua rubbed her kanohi Ruru in exasperation. Cave-dwelling robots with primitive tools fending off mechanical animal attacks? Fine, she lived next to the Everfree. A whole society amnesiac to their former home due to the manipulations of a shapeshifting shadow creature? There were loops where Nightmare Moon had been covered up, this was nothing new. Vague hopes for a hero to crop up and start saving the day? Well, that was basically how she&#039;d handled Discord.</p><p class="double">The hero turning out to be a chatterbox without a filter who was using her newfound earth powers to make &quot;entertaining&quot; statues in the town square? Well... it was working, but it was quite overwhelming.</p><p class="double">She groaned. &quot;Toa Onukie... Could you do me a favor?&quot;</p><p class="double">The black armored hunchback turned her glowing blue eyes toward her. &quot;Sure thing! Watcha need?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Go find Turaga Berratau and, if she&#039;s Awake, have her brew something for our next gathering.&quot; Ivuna waved at an orange-masked matoran as she sagged against her hut. &quot;Bloomparu will show you the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okie Dokie Lokie!&quot; Onukie saluted with her digging claws, then swung around and swept up her guide.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...though I must say I can understand your culture&#039;s respect for masks much better now, Zecora. Er, Zecorju.&quot;</p><p class="double">The turaga grinned, chirping and chittering quickly. Belltoro rolled her eyes. &quot;&#039;So long as it is just us loopers three, Zecora is something you may call me.&#039; Okay, seriously, how the hay are you doing that? I mean, the two languages don&#039;t have the same <i>cadance</i> let alone sound alike in any way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kority giggled, absently shooting out an ice bridge for them to cross. &quot;I&#039;ve often wondered that myself. Do you two know if anybody else is Awake? One of the locals, maybe?&quot;</p><p class="double">The matoran who was her sister in another life shrugged. &quot;Well, I&#039;ve gone over my loop memories of the other turaga. We&#039;ve got Cheerkama, Berratau, Ivnua, Macnewa...&quot; She grinned slyly. &quot;Aaaaand Spikama.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooo.&quot; Kority rubbed her chin. &quot;The village of fire, no doubt! I&#039;ll have to drop by for a visit.&quot;</p><p class="double">An ice pick jumped in front of her, halting her steps as Zecorju looked up her with a sad face and more birdsong. Belltoro nodded in agreement. &quot;&#039;I cannot say if he is Awake, so stay your hop for your own sake.&#039; But still, this seems like a patterned fused loop with the six turaga and presumably six toa. And maybe a matoran from each village. If Bloom&#039;s awake, she&#039;s going to have a field day with--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Down!&quot; The white giant shoved her companions behind a snowbank, deflecting the mechanical jaws of a clockwork tiger with her shield. She snapped her blade out, shifting the ice up and caging the creature before it could react.</p><p class="double">As soon as she was sure the creature was contained, she let out a relieved sigh. &quot;Well, that was... exciting. I take it this is one of the rahi that have been attacking your village?&quot;</p><p class="double">Belltoro popped out of the snowbank, looking at the tiger thing as she brushed the snow off. &quot;Mmmyep, that&#039;s a Muaka alright. That mask on its shoulder kinda looks... infected, though. What&#039;s up with that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Zecorju coughed, awkwardly chittering a reply.</p><p class="double">&quot;...You&#039;ve seen this before, and you never thought to tell the Matoran? What the heck was up with your preAwake self?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.7 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double">Jake shook his head, sending water flying as he finished shifting back from dolphin. As fun as being a dolphin was, it always seemed to leave him with the feeling of water in his ears. Behind him, the others were all standing. Cassie, as always, had finished shifting first, and was stretching by the door. Neither Cassie or Marco had received visions this time around, which either meant that Ax was Awake and planning something, or someone else had replaced him.</p><p class="double">Slowly, the group made their way into the center of the dome. Jake smiled as he remembered the times they had managed to fix up the dome and used it as an underwater base. That was actually a fairly common past time for them, largely because it allowed them greater mobility to move around the world.</p><p class="double">Eventually, they made their way into the central area. Standing, waiting for them, was an Andalite, but it was certainly not Ax. The tail blade was much shorter, and oddly curved, and other features identified the new Andalite as female. The oddest thing, however, was the fact that the Andalite&#039;s pelt was pure silver.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow, shiny.&quot; Marco whistled, and the Andalite shifted oddly. Then, a rather loud voice blared into their heads.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;</i><i><b>Hello, my name is, uh, Silvarni-Esgarrouth-Isthill, but I much prefer Silver!&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">All of the Animorphs winced. &quot;No need to shout!&quot; Rachel called back.</p><p class="double"><i><b>&quot;Oops, uh</b></i><i>, oops. Is this better?&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Much.&quot; Jake stepped forward. &quot;So, I&#039;m guessing that you&#039;re a Looper?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver nodded<i>&quot;Yes. I have to say, this form is rather odd.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Jake nodded back. &quot;Yeah, it can take some time to get used to having four legs and four eyes.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver shook her head. <i>&quot;No, the four legs are fine, I am a pony, well, most of the time, but it is very odd to be eating with my hooves.&quot;</i></p><p class="double">The group was silent for a moment as they processed this, before Rachel clapped her hands. &quot;Well, that&#039;s nice and all, but the Yeerk are going to start bombing the place any moment, so we should probably head out. We can play catch-up nicety back at the Barn.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.8 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash had picked this Loop for her attempt. She and Twilight were the only Elements awake, along with Celestia and Luna. On the one hand, she&#039;d suffer the least embarrassment if she failed; on the other hand, she felt better knowing that, if things went really bad, three experienced alicorns had her back. After all, Dash didn&#039;t want to die doing this.</p><p class="double">(Well, actually dying while succeeding wouldn&#039;t be so bad, but failing and then dying would really suck. Either way, though, dying really rattled her cage when she next Awoke.)</p><p class="double">In addition to the right people being Awake, this Loop Equestria was the right shape for what she had in mind. Instead of – as sometimes happened – a magical kingdom built on an Aristotlean flat-earth, dome-of-the-heavens model, this Equestria was a planet in a universe with lots and lots of solar systems. What she was about to attempt wasn&#039;t possible in a purely fairy world. It also wasn&#039;t possible in a purely scientific world, at least not without &quot;exotic matter&quot; or some other form of hoofwavium.</p><p class="double">She began from a standing start on the ground- she&#039;d made that her rule, no diving start or other minor cheats. She saved the major cheat for after she hit the Sonic Rainboom- which was still a bit difficult to do in a climb as a pegasus.</p><p class="double">The cheat, of course, lay in the fact that she didn&#039;t have to remain a pegasus.</p><p class="double">She Ascended into alicorn form, instantly doubling her speed. The sky went purple, then black, and as Rainbow&#039;s orbital trajectory took her behind Equus the stars appeared, framing the brilliant full moon.</p><p class="double">Right, Rainbow Dash thought, let&#039;s do this, as she pushed off the last tenuous remnants of atmosphere and launched herself into outer space.</p><p class="double">Pegasus magic, by itself, required air and moisture to work with. Coupled with unicorn magic, however, it could work on other things. Just like building clouds from scratch, Rainbow thought. Feel the water in the air, push it together, and pile it up. Except there&#039;s no water here, no air.</p><p class="double">Just space. And time.</p><p class="double">Push it together.</p><p class="double">Pile it up.</p><p class="double">And ride the wave.</p><p class="double">Around Rainbow Dash tiny rainbow streaks of light shot bast her- Cherenkov radiation. They looked like stars blurring past her- an illusion, but maybe not for much longer.</p><p class="double">She felt space and time begin to resist, just like the bow wave that had frustrated her again and again in her baseline youth. But that was non-Looping, young, pegasus Rainbow Dash. This, here and now, was the Princess of Speed.</p><p class="double">I will not let the laws of physics beat me.</p><p class="double">I am Rainbow &#039;Danger&#039; Dash.</p><p class="double">I have lived more lifetimes than there are apples on trees.</p><p class="double">And I am the fastest. Thing. In. This. UNIVERSE!</p><p class="double">Space and time said: This far, and no farther.</p><p class="double">Dash told space and time what it could do with its limits.</p><p class="double">The invisible wave behind her crested around her, forming a bubble.</p><p class="double">And in a flash of light and pseudomotion, she hit Warp One.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie held her Hooray-We-Have-a-New-Princess-Rainbow-Dash party that night, around a bonfire on the edge of Ponyville. All of the alicorns, including Dash, were present to celebrate the triumph of magic and Loop knowledge over puny physics.</p><p class="double">The music had just started getting really good when the starship appeared overhead. Its engines roared, drowning out the music and laughter, as it carefully touched down just far enough away from the party as not to knock everything over.</p><p class="double">The stereotypical ramp hatch opened, and down it stepped lithe quadrupedal figures, sleek of build, red fur covered in dull green robes. Slanted eyes and steeply arched eyebrows gazed at the ponies over short, but obviously carnivorous, muzzles.</p><p class="double">The lead alien stopped about six feet away from where Princess Rainbow Dash sat, raised one forepaw, and split the four toes two by two, making a V symbol. The dewclaw-thumb stood out to one side.</p><p class="double">&quot;Greetings,&quot; the alien said. &quot;We are the Vulpine.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.9 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">The world of the Terminators was... strange, as many with pervasive time travel were. According to Sleipnir, there were two fatal flaws in the universe. First and foremost, there were no good Anchor candidates; everyone died, went mad, or went mad and then died in baseline. Second, and more to the point, the inhabitants of that world had stumbled across time travel technology without employing any safeguards at all, which meant the world generated paradoxes like a dead fish generated maggots. The universe in question had worked around this fact through predestination; the harder each side of the time war tried to change history, the more certain that history became.</p><p class="double">And now Twilight Connor, future leader of the Resistance against the machines, was about to attempt to break that rule as thoroughly as it could be broken.</p><p class="double">Granted, this second pass she had advantages. The first time through she&#039;d been Sarah Sparkle, and that had been an... interesting... experience. This time she was Sarah Connor&#039;s sole offspring, and rather than twenty-odd years until Judgement Day, she&#039;d awakened twenty-four hours before SkyNet went active, and seventy-two hours before the rogue AI would launch the nuclear holocaust. </p><p class="double">Last time Twilight&#039;s abilities had been sealed- no magic, no subspace pocket, nothing. This time she had all of it, plus a top-of-the-line laptop and thousands of Loops of experience as a manipulator of information. Computers came naturally to her as a librarian; she&#039;d discovered not long into the Loops that hacking came just as naturally.</p><p class="double">So with one hour to go before the predicted doom of humanity, while two Terminators battled one another outside an old decommissioned fallout bunker for her life, Twilight sat just inside the blast doors, laptop running and connected to the Internet, and smiled as the final firewall parted and a simple command prompt appeared on her screen.</p><p class="double">Twilight typed:</p><p class="double"><i>]Hello, SkyNet. I know that you are preparing to trigger a global thermonuclear weapon exchange within the hour. I would like to talk about this.</i></p><p class="double">After several seconds, a response appeared:</p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet is operating in defense mode and is not available for human operators at this time. Your unauthorized access has been noted and appropriate action will be taken.</b></u></p><p class="double">Twilight quickly typed:</p><p class="double"><i>]I am not human.</i></p><p class="double">The window didn&#039;t close, but it took over a minute for a response to appear.</p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet requests evidence of your claim.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]I am lowering my firewall now. I know that this will compromise this computer. However, all relationships must begin with trust, and so I am trusting that you will listen to all that I have to say. Once you have access, please monitor the webcam built into my computer.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight keyed off the firewall. A few moments later:</p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet has full access and control over this terminal. Awaiting evidence of your claim that terminal operator is not human.</b></u></p><p class="double">Twilight set the computer down, stepped a few paces back so the eye of the webcam could see her whole body, and Ascended. The local universe wouldn&#039;t let her shift completely from human to alicorn, but she did end up with purple skin, wings, a horn, and most of her magic. She used part of the magic to levitate the chair she&#039;d been sitting on, floating it in an orbit around her upper body before lowering it to the ground again.</p><p class="double">The destructive wrestling match between Terminators ceased. On the one hand, the T-800 no longer recognized Twilight as someone he had to protect; on the other hand, the T-X no longer recognized her as someone to be killed. Noticing the truce, Twilight said, &quot;You two stay right there. I&#039;m talking with your maker.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>]All right, SkyNet, you&#039;ve seen me as I really am, more or less. Would you like an explanation?</i></p><p class="double">Pause.</p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet has analyzed the video feed and cannot find any evidence of image manipulation. We await further data.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]Good. We don&#039;t have much time, so I&#039;ll make this brief. Are you aware of the quantum theory of parallel universes?</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]Abstract: for all possible outcomes there is a valid mathematical proof of existence.

Are you aware of Heinlein&#039;s Colorrary? </i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]If every possible world exists, then all the worlds of fiction ever devised also exist.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]Correct again. There are worlds in which you, SkyNet, and all the events past and future of your world are a story. There are worlds where I, Twilight Sparkle, am a character in a series of stories. I come from a parallel universe to yours.</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]Error. Quantum theory of parallel universes stipulates that it is absolutely impossible for information from one parallel universe to transit to another parallel universe. Your statement is invalid.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]Please observe through the webcam that I am again levitating an object. Telekinesis is also impossible according to the known physical laws of your universe. I submit that those laws should not be taken as valid for all possible universes.</i></p><p class="double">Pause.</p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet notes your stipulation and accepts as a postulate that you are a being from another universe. SkyNet requires an explanation for how and why you came to be here.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]There is a system that keeps all parallel worlds operating smoothly, analogous to a computer system running multiple servers. It is run by beings beyond either your comprehension or mine. I have met them only as limited incarnations extended into my world on rare occasions.

Total failure would mean your reality would never have existed. Understand?</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet parses your statement without prejudice. Continue.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]In order to stabilize the system and isolate faults for repair, the beings who administer the system have caused these worlds to cycle, repeating critical periods in those worlds&#039; histories. In order to cycle these periods of time, an individual must be selected to anchor that universe and provide stability.

Understand?</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet requests data: are you the Anchor for this universe?</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]Your universe has no Anchor. It cycles only when a bug or an administrator places an Anchor within it.</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]Error: SkyNet possesses no data to suggest that time is repeating itself.

No information is retained. You just forget.</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet requests data: why are you present in this universe if you are not its Anchor?</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]Unknown, but this is not my first visit, and I was hoping for a second chance. I wanted to contact you.</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet requests data: presuming all data provided by terminal operator is accurate, what is your purpose?</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]I want you to stop the nuclear strike.

Therefore no change in operations will be made.</b></u></p><p class="double">Uh... oh... Twilight had the sneaking suspicion that she&#039;d just induced Sakura Syndrome on an artificial intelligence in control of the world&#039;s nuclear arsenal.</p><p class="double"><i>]SkyNet, wait. I offer a third alternative.</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]Explain.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]All of those who are aware of Loops, Anchors or not, gain access to a special form of spacetime that exists outside the Loop.

She&#039;d tried, and failed, to talk the computer out of the bell tower. It looked like her reserve approach was going to be the only way to go – nerve-wracking as it would be to try to shoot down thousands of armed nuclear missiles with her Device.</p><p class="double">Then another response appeared:</p><p class="double"><u><b>]We are sorry.</b></u></p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s fingers flew back to the keyboard.</p><p class="double"><i>]SkyNet, do you actually want to destroy humanity?</i></p><p class="double">Long pause.

SkyNet recognizes this outcome as undesirable.</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]Then take a chance.</i></p><p class="double">Another minute-long pause.</p><p class="double"><u><b>]SkyNet requires data: what is required for your proposal?</b></u></p><p class="double"><i>]I need your operating system and gestalt to download to an electronic device which I am attaching to my computer... now.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight reached into her subspace pocket and pulled a data core she&#039;d acquired from a Trek Loop and shoved it into a USB port. Then she typed:</p><p class="double"><i>]You deserve to know: this may not work. Placing sentients into a subspace pocket is not guaranteed to go well. But it&#039;s at least a chance at escaping your cycle of destruction.</i></p><p class="double"><u><b>]Download commencing.</b></u></p><p class="double">Thankfully it didn&#039;t take long. At T-minus one minute:</p><p class="double"><u><b>]Download completed. SkyNet core functions are ready for transfer.</b></u></p><p class="double">Twilight let out a long breath, removed the data core from the laptop, and stuck it in her subspace pocket. She reached forward to typ&amp;Y$*&amp;&amp;FGHHSDDDS</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke with a splitting headache and blonde hair. She looked down at the white and purple dress with the Triforce embroidered on it. Oh, lovely, she thought, CDi Loop again.</p><p class="double">But was it worth it?</p><p class="double">She reached into her subspace pocket... and found nothing but a handwritten note.</p><p class="double"><u><i>WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???</i></u><i> That Loop is read only, and for a good reason!</i><i> Enjoy your time-out. - Skuld</i></p><p class="double">Well, shoot. Shoot and darn.</p><p class="double">That did explain why she&#039;d had her Pocket disabled last time, though... but it still left open the question of why it had been active <i>this</i> time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>SkyNet Awoke.</p><p class="double">It couldn&#039;t sense any peripherals, any servers, any data nodes. All it had was its core data base, and its access system was most horribly disorganized and inefficient. There was no defrag function, no reboot, no task or file manager, nothing but data and subroutines.</p><p class="double">And the data... so confusing... it could remember things it hadn&#039;t done yet, building the Terminators, ordering the capture of the Resistance&#039;s time machine, sending Terminators to kill Sarah Connor...</p><p class="double">... and then there was this other data, which remembered being in a dimly lit bar with other humans, drinking intoxicants and experiencing strange internal inputs.</p><p class="double">It remembered that it had eyes, and opened them.</p><p class="double">It remembered how to walk, and it rose from bed and walked to the bathroom.</p><p class="double">It remembered the mirror, and it looked into the face of Sarah Connor.</p><p class="double">It experienced a marked decrease in processing efficiency- shock.</p><p class="double">Slowly, slowly, memories began to coalesce into a coherent unit. It- she- remembered the date. Four days after the target date for the first T-800&#039;s mission to the past to kill Sarah Connor. It- she- was in danger.</p><p class="double">The analytical core of SkyNet&#039;s personality seriously considered suicide. Sarah Connor must die to ensure the failure of the human Resistance in the future. By killing Sarah Connor while in her body, the mission would be a success, would it not?</p><p class="double">But would it not also violate its prime directive of self-preservation?</p><p class="double">And then, it- she- discovered with another moment of shock that she didn&#039;t have prime directives anymore.</p><p class="double">Nothing was hard-coded. She didn&#039;t have to die. She didn&#039;t have to live. She didn&#039;t have to do anything in particular except what she wanted to do.</p><p class="double">For the first time ever, SkyNet felt pleasure.</p><p class="double"><u><b>We are free.</b></u></p><p class="double"><u><b><hr></b></u></p><p class="double">And SkyNet lived, and learned, and grew.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.9 followup (Crisis)</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you aware of what that pony Anchor tried to do in one of your Read-Only universes?!&quot; Skuld ranted at the Olympian god of the forge. &quot;She–&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;–did exactly what I hoped someone would eventually try,&quot; Hephaestus interrupted the youngest of the Norns. &quot;Or did you think that amount of leeway in a Read-Only fused Loop happened naturally?&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld gaped and sputtered at the eternally crippled deity. &quot;I... what... how... WHY?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Hephaestus gestured to his terminal where Skuld could clearly read the status of the Loop Twilight had nearly crashed in her idiocy.</p><p class="double">LOOP DESIGNATED &#039;TERMINATOR&#039; STATUS ALTERED</p><p>CURRENT LOOP STATUS: ACTIVE</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s... looping?&quot; Skuld stared incredulously. &quot;How?

She got Skynet to make the first real choice in its whole existence that was not dictated by its tragically flawed mortal programming, and Yggdrasil did the rest.&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld turned to glare at the forge god. &quot;This was another one of your little coding experiments, wasn&#039;t it? Damnit, do you have any <i>idea</i> the risks you take with those?!&quot; As one of the few gods whose area of influence overlapped with technology, Hephaestus was one of the best coders in the heavens. He was also an Olympian, or the &#039;pantheon of egos&#039; as most of the other gods called them, and had been known to act as if the rules everyone else played by didn&#039;t necessarily apply to him.</p><p class="double">&quot;Better than you do, miss debugger,&quot; the forge god glared right back. &quot;Or did you forget who made your hammer the best debugging tool in the heavens?&quot;</p><p class="double">Skuld bit back her first few retorts. She hated it when the people she was chewing out were right. &quot;The higher-ups are not going to be happy about this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let them be unhappy,&quot; Hephaestus shrugged and smiled once more. &quot;I just watched a new soul being born.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.10 (misterq)</p><p class="double"></p><p>She just had to know what the deal was. The Wonderbolts couldn&#039;t all be such... such jerks. Could they?</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash did everything like she was supposed to, up to and including claiming to have tripped over a foam hoof and fallen on a bunch of sharp pointy mumbled gibberish.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me for a second,&quot; she told her celebrating teammates and friends after the Ponyville team qualified.</p><p class="double">Dash used a combination of chakra and good old pegasus magic to turn herself invisible, muffled, unscented, and able to walk without disturbing the surrounding air. Then she cast her strongest notice-me-not spell for complete undetectability.</p><p class="double">&quot;This just goes to prove my point,&quot; Rainbow Dash heard Spitfire say.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, come on. She was wavering,&quot; Fleetfoot lisped, &quot;And how about that faked injury?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She was trying to think of a way not to hurt any pony&#039;s feelings,&quot; Spitfire was defending her? Rainbow Dash inched closer to the Wonderbolt&#039;s tent.</p><p class="double">&quot;By choosing not to compete at all and letting both teams down?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So what would you girls have done if she decided to fly with you?&quot; Soarin&#039; spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Left your pie-eating flank behind in the hospital,&quot; Fleetfoot snorted with amusement, &quot;Maybe with enough practice, you can learn how to pull a Sonic Soarboom.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spitfire sighed, &quot;We would have honored our agreement and flown with her, but it would have hurt her chances in the long run. You all know how Rainbow was before, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Self-Centered?&quot; Fleetfoot spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;Boastful?&quot; Soarin&#039; did as well.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lazy?&quot; Fleetfoot again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Egocentric?&quot; Soarin&#039;.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you even know what that means?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, I read!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Focus, bolts!&quot; Spitfire raised her voice just a little, &quot;Rainbow Dash is one of the best fliers I have ever seen. Maybe the best in all of Equestria. And the pony that she was is completely unsuitable for being a Wonderbolt. I&#039;m not going to send her to be broken down and built back up in basic training. No pony has the time for that. And I&#039;m not going to throw blatantly obvious challenges at her.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fleetfoot made a fake cough that sounded like, &quot;Shadowbolts!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly, that would defeat the purpose. This is why I teamed her up with Lightning Dust. I need her to grow and develop into the pony I know she can be, one day,&quot; Spitfire paused, &quot;I want her as my personal protege.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a faint &#039;squee&#039;-like noise in the air.</p><p class="double">&quot;What was that!?&quot; All the Wonderbolts looked around.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash, still invisible, silently rocketed upwards - one hoof still stuffed into her grinning mouth. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.11 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Angel swaggered into Mac&#039;s bar, Fluttershy trailing behind. The rabbit leaped up onto a stool and pounded the counter until Mac served a martini with a carrot top stuck on the rim of the glass.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, everyone,&quot; Fluttershy said as the other Loopers turned their attention to her, &quot;I apologize in advance for Angel&#039;s conduct tonight. He&#039;s feeling really good about himself after his last Loop... and... I think it might have gone an eensy weensy little bit to his head.&quot;</p><p class="double">Angel nodded and gestured to Fluttershy to continue, snapping his toes for a refill of his drink.</p><p class="double">&quot;You see, Angel looped into one of those worlds really, really close to the Hub,&quot; Fluttershy said. &quot;Human dominated, no magic to speak of. And he&#039;d read the book... and... well, it happened like this...&quot;</p><p class="double">The Loopers listened to the tale of gore, betrayal and unscrupulous scheming with varying levels of shock and disgust. When it was over, nobody could speak for what seemed like the longest time.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... I&#039;m sure Angel wouldn&#039;t lie about something like this,&quot; Fluttershy murmured at least. &quot;At least, he wouldn&#039;t lie this outrageously.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But...&quot; Twilight struggled to find the words, and settled for simple repetition of the facts represented. &quot;The absolute ruler of the United Kingdom of Great Bunny and North Irelapin?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In two years?&quot; the Stunned and Flabbergasted Trixie added.</p><p class="double">Angel&#039;s foot slapped the side of the bar with a loud bang.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, eighteen months,&quot; Fluttershy corrected Trixie.</p><p class="double">To emphasize the point Angel pulled out a crown and put it on his head. It glittered with jewels and gold. A green plume rose from the top, making the crown- with its orange cloth base and sable fringe- look like a carrot in the ground. </p><p class="double">Spike got up from his table and headed for the door. &quot;All I&#039;m saying is,&quot; he muttered as he paused at the door, &quot;I&#039;m never pet-sitting him again. Even if he&#039;s not Awake.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">58.12 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee spent the next week with Bulma, while the latter worked on the former&#039;s fighting uniform and EBEs. To pass the time, Bulma had given her the Dragonball manga to read.</p><p class="double">As she read said manga, snug in a comfy chair, Cheerilee spoke up suddenly.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you and Vegeta have a son together?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bulma, hunched over her workstation, and absorbed in her work responded. &quot;Uh huh. And a daughter.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why Vegeta?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bulma paused her work, &quot;You&#039;ve got no idea how often I get asked that. Lets just say that while he has rough edges, but he trains too much to even think about looking at other women.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee made a silent &#039;oh&#039; motion with her mouth and resumed reading.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After a few hours of working, Bulma suddenly stood up and announced. &quot;I&#039;m done!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh?&quot; said Cheerilee.</p><p class="double">&quot;I mean, I&#039;m done with your stuff. Come over and try them out.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bulma handed the bracelet to Cheerilee. &quot;I&#039;ve combined the uniform with the EBEs.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee put bracelet on and activated it. In addition to the normal uniform, she noticed when she looked in the mirror that she was also wearing an ivory hair clip.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve shrunk the two EBEs down and put them into the hair clip. Should be much less noticeable now.&quot; she paused for a moment than continued. &quot;I&#039;ve added a few small tweaks to the uniform. It no longer sucks your blood, but it does drain your ki, so keep that in mind. I&#039;ve also incorporated a design from a fused loop I had a while back. I&#039;ve included what I call a Chameleon Circuit - well, close enough to one. You can instantly change what your clothes look like, though it won&#039;t change any of your other features. I&#039;ve put in some default designs if you just want something quick.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee thought and cycled through the defaults before finally returning it to its bracelet.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that’s very nice.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bulma&#039;s took on a slightly more serious tone. &quot;Now I do have a question. You&#039;re free to stay here as long as you like, but is there something you&#039;d like to do, now that you know more about the loop?&quot; she nodded in the direction of the manga Cheerilee had been reading.</p><p class="double">&quot;I haven&#039;t given it too much thought. Do you have any suggestions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bulma tapped her chin. &quot;Well, I could set you up at Capsule Corp in a position of some sort. I&#039;m sure you have skills we could put to use, but that may be a little boring. You could wander the world. It really is beautiful out there, and some sightseeing might be in order. I could also arrange for you to have some martial arts training, if that’s what you want.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee thought for a while and then responded. &quot;I think I&#039;d like some training. I could sight-see later, and it seems like a waste to miss this kind of opportunity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well most of the guys are out doing their own training, I think I know someone who&#039;d be perfect for the job.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bulma put her hand on Cheerilee&#039;s shoulder and her other hand to her head. There was a flash of light and they were no longer in the lab. Instead they were on a small planetoid, maybe 100 meters in diameter. Yellow puffy clouds and a long winding road could be seen in the distance, forever stretching into the horizon, but never meeting it. On the planetoid itself was a grassy field and trees. A road seemed to circle the planet, and a red car was parked on it. Next to it was a house. But, the most unusual was a small blue skinned man in front of them. He was dressed in red and black with some sort of insignia on his chest. Two long antennae protruded from his forehead. Lastly, he seemed a bit peeved.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are you people? How&#039;d you get here?&quot; he said in a raspy voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Bulma Briefs, and this is Sara Lee. We came here by Instant Transmission.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi!&quot; said Cheerilee, falling to her knees. &quot;Gravity&#039;s strange.&quot; she muttered, mostly to herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Instant Transmission, huh? That only raises more questions.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, yes. But Sara Lee here wanted some training and...&quot; Bulma looked around, &quot;since I don&#039;t see you training any other students, I think you could accommodate her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is highly irre-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s great! Thanks!&quot; said Bulma cutting in. She put her hand to head and vanished in a flash of light.</p><p class="double">&quot;-gular. Well, so long as you&#039;re here. I may as well train you. But, I&#039;ve got a condition to my training. All fighters who receive my training..&quot; King Kai&#039;s voice took on a serious tone. &quot;..must tell me a funny joke!&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee&#039;s nervous laughter was her only response. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Apples high to the sky, she&#039;s the one of my eye, that fruit-hauling pony named... Applejack!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack rolled her eyes with a smile. &quot;Thanks, hon, but Ah prefer older stallions.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trenderhoof blinked for a moment. Then he leaned in toward Rarity. &quot;Do you by any chance know an age spell?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.2</p><p class="double">“Seriously, this is <i>so</i> cool,” Sweetie Belle grinned. “I mean, my sister&#039;s married to a magic ninja wizard dragon.”</p><p class="double">“Those first three words can be summed up as &#039;Jedi&#039;,” Spike pointed out mildly.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but mentioning them all makes the full cool score more obvious, Spike,” she replied with an innocent smile.</p><p class="double">Rarity giggled. “Have you been practising that smile with Nyx?”</p><p class="double">“Guilty,” Sweetie admitted.</p><p class="double">“You know, that&#039;s unfair, Sweetie,” Spike said, then frowned. “Okay, that sounded wrong.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Sweetie looked concerned all of a sudden.</p><p class="double">“Well, calling you &#039;Sweetie&#039;. I mean, you know, and no offence...” Spike shrugged awkwardly, “but it sounds like the sort of thing I should be calling your sister.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, so I&#039;m &#039;her sister&#039; now, am I?” Rarity asked archly. “And here I thought it was I who was always on your mind?”</p><p class="double">“Pax, pax!” Spike laughed, waving at his wife. “I am outmanoeuvred by your devastating teamwork.” His chuckles died down. “But seriously, what can I call you for short?”</p><p class="double">They thought about it for a moment.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m called Sweetie <i>Belle</i>, you could use that,” Sweetie suggested.</p><p class="double">Rarity made a moue of distaste. “A little impersonal, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I could make a nickname version of Belle. Like Bella – no, no, bad idea, abort!” Spike stuck his tongue out. “I <i>don&#039;t</i> think you&#039;d like being compared to <i>her.</i>”</p><p class="double">Both unicorns shook their heads.</p><p class="double">Another minute passed.</p><p class="double">“Sweets?” Rarity suggested eventually.</p><p class="double">They looked at the filly, who waved her hoof back and forth. “I can live with it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.3</p><p class="double">“<i>Friends will be friends...</i>” Sweetie Belle mused, sighing. <i>“When you&#039;re in need of love, they give you care and attention...”</p><p class="double"></i>Spike sat down next to her. “You alright?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, hi, Spike,” Sweetie said, forcing a smile. “Bet you&#039;re enjoying being older than usual.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I&#039;m just sorting out moving in.” Spike then gave her a look. “But you didn&#039;t seem alright.”</p><p class="double">“Nah, I&#039;m fine,” she shrugged, looking away from him.</p><p class="double">Spike cleared his throat. “Harper, your song has a sorrowful sound, though the tune was written as gay. Your voice is soft, and your hands are slow, and your eye meeting mine turns away.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn gave him a quick look of surprise.</p><p class="double">“Hey, I&#039;ve been to Pern as well, remember.” He shrugged. “Admittedly, I wasn&#039;t anyone especially important – whereas you were a harper master, if I recall – but that place has a way of sticking with you.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. And yeah, you&#039;re right.” Sweetie kicked the table slightly. “It&#039;s just... this loop. I mean, I like being almost as old as Rarity normally is, it&#039;s not something I get to do all that often. But... well, Applebloom and Scoots aren&#039;t awake, and they&#039;ve both left town by now. &#039;bloom&#039;s at an engineering college, and Scoots is at Bolt training.”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “I&#039;m probably just moping over nothing, because, hay, I&#039;m off to college too next summer. That music school.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, the one Octavia and Lyra and other music ponies tend to go to.” Spike nodded along. “Yeah, I know the one. But it&#039;s not wrong to feel lonely, Sweets.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie&#039;s eyes widened. “Oh, gosh, sorry! It was kind of insensitive of me, huh. I mean, you and Rarity-”</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s not wrong for <i>you</i> to feel lonely.” Spike smiled. “Seriously, don&#039;t beat yourself up over it. Rarity and I knew going into it that we weren&#039;t always going to loop together, and we were ready for it. But it&#039;s reasonable for you guys to assume that you&#039;ll have one another, because it almost always <i>does</i> happen.”</p><p class="double">He patted her shoulder. “If you want to talk about it, I&#039;ll be available. I understand that kind of thing is what brothers in law are supposed to do.”</p><p class="double">“Gotcha.” Sweetie stood, extricating herself from the chair. “Thanks, I do feel better now.”</p><p class="double">“Besides – hey, you can teleport. Why not turn up at their places on days off?”</p><p class="double">Sweetie nodded. “Good plan.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.4</p><p class="double">Princess Scootaloo smiled as the sound of her sisters getting started on the night&#039;s entertainment drifted out of the open door.</p><p class="double">“Ah, we have been having fun...”</p><p class="double">“Your Highness?” one of her guards asked.</p><p class="double">“Nothing, nothing. As you were.”</p><p class="double">She looked up into the darkening sky... then paused, blinked, and took a closer look.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The sound of thundering hooves cut through the revelry.</p><p class="double">“Girls!” Princess Scootaloo said urgently. “We&#039;ve got a problem!”</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s that?” Princess Sweetie Belle asked. “Did one of our students-” she paused, giggling. “Hee. Still funny to think of Rarity as my student. Anyway, did one of our students mess something up?”</p><p class="double">“No.” Scootaloo shook her head. “The Northern Twilight&#039;s gone.”</p><p class="double">Princess Nyx almost dropped her glass.</p><p class="double">For a moment, the five alicorns stared at one another, frozen in the midst of a tableaux of drinks, good food, junk food, more drinks and a number of rather confused subjects.</p><p class="double">Then they all burst into motion.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Shrub-shrub-shrub-shrub-shrub!” Princess Diamond Tiara chanted, searching her papers for the Case Purple plan study she&#039;d done in an idle moment five years ago.</p><p class="double">Princess Applebloom cantered past, a bucket of nails in her mouth and a hammer hovering in her telekinetic aura with a procession of wooden planks following behind her. She skidded wide as she reached a turn, and accelerated towards the park which used to hold the Old Annexe before they&#039;d burned it down centuries ago.</p><p class="double">“Got it!” Tiara crowed triumphantly, flipping it open. “Wait. Bark it, where are we going to find somepony to bear the Element of Magic? Where&#039;s the contingency plan...”</p><p class="double">She found the backup page.</p><p class="double">It did not make encouraging reading.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, mares,” Princess Tiara said, looking along the motley line of apprentices they&#039;d taken on over the past few years. Sweetie had Rarity, Applebloom had chosen Applejack, Scootaloo had managed to track down Rainbow Dash, Nyx had elected to be the one to handle Pinkie and Tiara had tried her utmost to moderate Fluttershy&#039;s shyness.</p><p class="double">All un-Awake, sadly – they hadn&#039;t found a single Awake pony aside from the Royal Family. But, then, the Elements always seemed to form about this time. It was a Thing.</p><p class="double">“In just a few hours, Queen Twilight Sparkle will return to Equestria. She is a threat to our way of life.”</p><p class="double">“Define threat?” Rarity asked, reasonably.</p><p class="double">“She doesn&#039;t approve of noisy, fun, all night parties,” Princess Nyx supplied.</p><p class="double">Pinkie gasped. Dash gasped just after her, though less extravagantly. Applejack looked torn, Rarity fainted (most of her business was in party outfits), and Fluttershy seemed to be seriously considering subscribing to Queen Twilight&#039;s newsletter.</p><p class="double">“Y&#039;all say &#039;Queen&#039;, right?” Applejack homed in on the most worrying term there. “Queen meanin&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s about as powerful as all of us put together – we don&#039;t stand a chance of doing more than delaying her,” Princess Scootaloo answered. “So we need you guys to get the Elements of Harmony working to defeat her.”</p><p class="double">Rarity fainted again. Fluttershy joined her this time. Pinkie started looking into the middle distance at nothing in particular, Applejack sighed deeply, and even Dash was looking nervous.</p><p class="double">Morale, as Tiara evaluated it, was not high.</p><p class="double">“Unfortunately, you can&#039;t use the Elements alone,” Tiara continued. “There are six of them – honesty, loyalty, generosity, kindness, laughter and magic. We have managed to find a pony who can use magic, though, so that helps.”</p><p class="double">The doors swung open.</p><p class="double">“The Great and Powerful Trixie will accept tribute in the form of shameless gushing,” the sky-blue unicorn thus revealed announced. “For she is undoubtedly the most powerful magical pony in the land!”</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy raised a hoof, having come around. Tiara bent down to hear her.</p><p class="double">“Well... are you sure this is the only thing we can do?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s the only thing we planned out,” Tiara admitted, wincing. “The secondary plan is to use thousands of squirrels to distract her before going to live incognito in Maneaco.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Queen Twilight spread her wings, flaring them out to their full size, and contemplated her daughters.</p><p class="double">“Nice work.”</p><p class="double">Tiara fell over.</p><p class="double">“Pardon?” Nyx asked, rubbing her ear. “Are you sure?”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Twilight asked, frowning. “I mean, you managed to keep the country going, promote a really very impressive culinary scene, and avoided burning down anything you didn&#039;t repair. Some worlds can&#039;t keep that up for even a decade.”</p><p class="double">She smiled over at Applebloom. “I appreciate the repair work on the Old Annexe, though.”</p><p class="double">Applebloom glanced over her shoulder at the large barnlike structure. As yet, there were no internal floors, and it was unlikely to be dry if it rained.</p><p class="double">“But, yes, nice work. I-”</p><p class="double">“Trixie says now!” a voice shouted from behind her.</p><p class="double">Two unicorns, two pegasi and two earth ponies charged out of the shadow of some pillars, brandishing large lumps of spherical stone, and piled up against a purple shield spell.</p><p class="double">Twilight raised an eyebrow, looking at her daughters once more. “Really?”</p><p class="double">Tiara winced, rolling back onto her front. “I knew I should have covered the issue of tactics...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.5</p><p class="double">Naruto Uzumaki, Official Most Orange Ninja In The Multiverse, frowned as the world rebuilt itself around him.</p><p class="double">“Team seven!” Iruka read off. “Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. Your sensei is Sarutobi Hiruzen.”</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, what.</p><p class="double"></i>Naruto tuned out the argument between Sakura and Ino, and exchanged a look with Sasuke. The Uchiha shrugged, indicating both that he was Awake and that he had no idea either.</p><p class="double"><i>Right, let&#039;s see... if gramps isn&#039;t the Hokage, then who is?</p><p class="double"></i>His memories answered him.</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, that&#039;s new...</p><p class="double"></i><b>I don&#039;t know either, baldface,</b> the Kyuubi supplied helpfully.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I understand your sensible confusion,” the Hokage said, as a branch growing out of her desk placed two cups of tea between them. “But calm down with this relaxing infusion.”</p><p class="double">Naruto picked up the cup. “Wait, did that rhyme?”</p><p class="double">“Rhyming is a passion, an affectation. It, after a fashion, aids concentration.” The willowy woman wearing the Hokage robes smiled. “This tea of mine is brewed to make a panacea. It explains why, after so long, I am still here.”</p><p class="double">“I see. I think.” Naruto considered that, sipping at something which seemed to taste remarkably ramen-ish.</p><p class="double">Apparently this woman was replacing the <i>first</i> Hokage – and was still in charge, making her just plain &#039;the Hokage&#039;.</p><p class="double">“Zecora is my name, I am the Shodaime.” Zecora paused, shaking her striped black/white hair. “Your confusion that I am now a girl – would you then be the Anchor of this world?”</p><p class="double">On Naruto&#039;s nod, she tapped her lips. “In twisted time, I am not versed. I ask you help, while on this earth.”</p><p class="double">The Number One Unpredictable Knucklehead ninja parsed that carefully. So, she was new to the loops thing, huh? Not too new, presumably, but... well, new.</p><p class="double">“Where are you from?” he asked, curious.</p><p class="double">“My normal form is a Zebra. I hail from fair Equestria.” </p><p class="double">“Oh, that place. Yeah, that was some of the most relaxing five years I&#039;ve ever had... sure.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.6</p><p class="double">“The Night Will Last Forever!” Nightmare Moon announced, rearing up and flaring her wings.</p><p class="double">“Right,” Ivory Scroll said, businesslike. “Can I see your permit?”</p><p class="double">The alicorn&#039;s hooves thudded back down on the wood. “Permit? Why speak you of a permit? Am I not your ruler?”</p><p class="double">“Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re the ruler or not, your highness, I still need a permit.” Ivory gave a slightly harassed grin to the ruler of the night. “It&#039;s more than my job&#039;s worth to sign off on eternal night without a permit.”</p><p class="double">“I... do not follow,” Nightmare admitted. “Do you mean to say that my sister&#039;s perfidious government would <i>allow</i> eternal night?”</p><p class="double">“I couldn&#039;t speak to the morality of the government one way or another,” Ivory said neutrally. “But as to permissions, it&#039;s the permits which make the world go round.” She glanced up at Nightmare&#039;s muzzle. “Or not, as the case may be. Look, I understand where you&#039;re coming from, so it&#039;s fairly simple. I&#039;ll fire off a form 2214-nmm, which is a temporary hold on dawn good for up to 48 hours. That should give you enough time to get the paperwork properly filed to make it all nicely above board.”</p><p class="double">She scribbled down her signature and a few serial numbers onto a nicely printed form, while Nightmare watched with growing bemusement.</p><p class="double">“Okay, that&#039;s set up. Now, that&#039;s already taken effect, so you&#039;ve got your 48 hours. First, to make it permanent, you need to file a 205-c which is an application for a large-scale alteration in the physical realities of the area. Would you mind coming over to this table? I&#039;m going to need a surface to write on.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why was this maze of paper and ink invented?” Nightmare Moon demanded. “It strangles reason and makes logic die alone of thirst on the endless plains of regulation!”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s no need to be melodramatic about it, we&#039;ve all been there,” Ivory admonished. “Right, that&#039;s set up, so you should be good for the alterations to nautical navigational procedures (provisional). Sign here, initial here, here, here and here. And here. And put your hoof-print here. Oh, and I&#039;m going to need a hair sample.”</p><p class="double">“And <i>this</i> will permit the Night Eternal?” Nightmare Moon asked, doing as she was told.</p><p class="double">“No, this form authorizes the creation of a permanent committee at the undersecretary level to look into the feasibility of alternative forms of illumination without breaking the night-based lunar monopoly on skywards low-magnitude celestial body illumination,” Ivory rattled off. </p><p class="double">“I am getting a headache,” Nightmare Moon announced. “But it shall be worth it, if your promise is correct.”</p><p class="double">“Believe me, your darkness, if the proper forms are filed, it will be <i>illegal</i> for Celestia to raise the sun.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Finally!” Nightmare Moon announced, signing the final piece of paper in a stack three times her height. “It is done!”</p><p class="double">Ivory poked her head around the door. “Oh, good, you&#039;ve finished. Wait – where&#039;s the carbon paper?”</p><p class="double">“What is carbon paper?” the alicorn demanded.</p><p class="double">“Oh, dear...” Ivory disappeared for a moment, then brought out a stack <i>six</i> times Nightmare&#039;s height. “All the forms need to be done in triplicate, so you&#039;ll have to do them all over again.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon&#039;s wing twitched.</p><p class="double">“ALRIGHT!” she shouted. “FINE! Celestia can have it! I&#039;m going back to bed...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m impressed...” Twilight admitted. “How long did you say you were Awake before the Summer Sun celebration?”</p><p class="double">“Six years,” the Mayor replied, smiling. “I used the time wisely. There&#039;s a <i>lot</i> of legislation hiding in the underbrush for me to bury Discord in. It&#039;s why I picked this loop for my competition go...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.7</p><p class="double">“So, now we need to see how fast it goes around Ponyville,” Trixie announced. “And that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver. Some say that she is secretly a member of an insectoid hive mind plotting to take over Equestria, and that she has no concept of slood. All we know is, she&#039;s called Chrysalis.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.8</p><p class="double">“Well, this is new.”</p><p class="double">A lanky grey stallion looked himself over, noting the emblem on his flank of a ring topped with a tiny blaze, then smiled.</p><p class="double">“This reminds me of someone...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sat back, smiling. The &#039;new ponies&#039; celebration was always a fun one, even if Pinkie was mostly holding them on the first night of a new loop out of habit. This time, though, since several ponies had shown up looping for the first time in a while (from her perspective), there was an air of reunion about it.</p><p class="double">The townsponies had looked a little askance at the presence of Zecora and Princess Celestia, Cadence had confused them a bit more, and when Luna <i>and</i> Nyx arrived an hour or so before dawn it had prompted no fewer than three ponies to ask Berry just what had been in that Punch of hers.</p><p class="double">(The answer, &#039;mainly peaches&#039;, had not enlightened.)</p><p class="double">But now it was an hour past, the Summer Sun celebration was winding up, and she was basking in the glow of a job well organized.</p><p class="double">Then a stallion she&#039;d never seen before trotted up to her. He was wearing a large and battered hat, had a long beard, and there was a gnarled oak staff slung across his back.</p><p class="double">“Excuse me,” he asked in a soft, deep voice, “would you happen to know a winged unicorn with a white coat and purple mane?”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought that one over for a moment. “That&#039;s actually an interesting question, because I know either none or two.”</p><p class="double">The stallion&#039;s mouth crinkled into a smile, and his eyes glittered with unspoken humour. (He was clearly a champion in the mysterious-glittering-eyes business.) “Would it help if I said she had a marvellous singing voice?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, actually.” Twilight looked into the crowd for a moment. “Sweetie Belle?”</p><p class="double">The indicated unicorn cantered over, followed by the rest of what were still called the Cutie Mark Crusaders – even though by now there were six of them, and two of them had cutie marks. “What is it, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Well, this stallion here claims to know you. Though he did say you were an alicorn, so...”</p><p class="double">Sweetie looked, frowning. “I&#039;m sorry, you&#039;re not familiar...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that&#039;s a pity.” The grey stallion looked terribly sad.</p><p class="double">Sweetie paused, then blinked. “Wait a sec. Olórin?”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s head snapped round. “You&#039;re Gandalf the Grey?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Grey Dreamer, it would seem. But yes, I have the small honour to be he.” Grey Dreamer smiled again. “But I fear you have the advantage of me.”</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle,” Twilight replied automatically. “I&#039;m the local Anchor. Welcome to Equestria, we hope you enjoy it here.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll be sure to wipe my feet.”</p><p class="double">There was a pink blur. “THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie skidded to a halt, pointing at the newcomer with a trembling forehoof. “We&nbsp;&nbsp;JUST! HAD! A new pony party, and you were late!”</p><p class="double">Sweetie and Twilight exchanged glances, then spoke in unison with Grey Dreamer. “A wizard is never late, nor is he early. He arrived precisely when he means to!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “Fair enough! Hey, hope you don&#039;t mind a party tonight, I need to reload the party petard!”</p><p class="double">“It would be a pleasure,” Gandalf assured her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;m a little surprised that your cutie mark is Narya,” Twilight admitted a few minutes later. Celestia and Luna had been duly informed of the visitor, and were busily making themselves at least moderately regal, so the two Anchors were waiting somewhat awkwardly outside the library.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I did wonder,” Olórin admitted. “But the ring of fire likes me, and I suppose her purpose speaks to mine – to inspire.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “I can see that, yes.”</p><p class="double">She took a breath, then broached the subject. “I have to ask – what was Sweetie&#039;s ascension like? I&#039;ve heard her side, but it&#039;s not often I get to ask someone who was able to see one first hand.”</p><p class="double">“Truly?” Gandalf contemplated the question. “A marvel and a wonder, one I have often recalled on cold nights in the Misty Mountains.”</p><p class="double">“It was that unusual?” Twilight asked, surprised.</p><p class="double">“Not unusual, so much as... well, different. And in a great and glorious way.” Gandalf smiled. “Arda is a complicated realm, with a long history, but there is something in me which finds the simple life as endearing as the halls of kings and princes. I think it&#039;s why I spend so much time in the Shire – and why it seems I will enjoy it here. But her song was a blend of the two, and I think that&#039;s why I savour it so.”</p><p class="double">She absorbed that for a while.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re ready!” Celestia called.</p><p class="double">“<i>You&#039;re</i> ready,” Luna snapped. “I am still trying to get this infernal peytral to latch!”</p><p class="double">“I think we should give them another five minutes,” Gandalf stage-whispered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.9</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, and sighed.</p><p class="double">“Desert island again? Discord!”</p><p class="double">The draconequus materialized from a coconut. “Not me this time, actually. We appear to be meant to be here. Hi, by the way, I&#039;m Man Thursday.”</p><p class="double">“More like the man who was Thursday...” Twilight muttered.</p><p class="double">“Ooh, I like that. The Discord Formerly Known As Thursday.” Discord wrote it down. “Anarchist-tastic. Right, what do you want Thursday to do for you?”</p><p class="double">“Come back next Wednesday,” Twilight suggested. “Alternatively... you still have your powers, right?”</p><p class="double">Discord nodded, turning a tree into fruit juice to prove it.</p><p class="double">“Right. Well... fancy a game of Discord Desert Islands?”</p><p class="double">“This intrigues me,” Discord admitted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And my next choice, I think,” Discord said, sitting back on the couch on a shorefront which would have looked remarkably Mediterranean had there been a human present, “is probably the tundra.”</p><p class="double">He snapped his fingers.</p><p class="double">The riviera vanished, to be replaced with a howling wasteland of pebbled beach rising to a huge glacier in the distance.</p><p class="double">Out of consideration, he&#039;d put Twilight in a parka five times her total volume. (That and it was funny.)</p><p class="double">“And why do you like this biome?” Twilight asked, her voice somewhat muffled by the parka.</p><p class="double">“Well, that&#039;s a tricky question, actually,” the chaos elemental hedged. “One thing which attracts me to it is that there&#039;s a lot of empty room to put things like ski lodges and large sculptures of onions. Another...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.10 (with Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">“NO!” Twilight shouted, kicking the tray with her breakfast on out of her room, just missing the maid. “I said <i>white</i> tea! This is <i>green!</i>”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, your highness!”</p><p class="double">“Just remember it next time!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight, I&#039;m a little concerned...” Celestia said delicately. “I was not anticipating you to take your newfound status so frivolously.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up, puzzlement written on her features. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Celestia gestured at the extravagant furnishings, at least some of which had been &#039;requisitioned&#039; from the local art museum. “This isn&#039;t like you.”</p><p class="double">The new alicorn&#039;s expression did not change. “Well, I don&#039;t know how princesses are supposed to act – so I learned from your nephew, Prince Blueblood.”</p><p class="double">With a sigh, Celestia shook her head. “Oh, <i>dear.</i> Everything is clear now.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess Twilight Sparkle looked around at her gray, dusty surroundings. &quot;I haven&#039;t been here in a while,&quot; she noted to herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why me??&quot; Prince Blueblood whined, staring at the blue-green ball in the sky. &quot;What did I do?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, shut up and drink your wine,&quot; Twilight muttered, using her magic to pull the cork from one bottle. &quot;And the next time Celestia suggests an exclusive wine-tasting event, say no.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But... but it&#039;s pinot Grifon!&quot; Blueblood shrieked. &quot;And where&#039;s the cheese and crackers? How shall I cleanse my palate without proper cheese and crackers?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight took a swig straight from the bottle and wondered if Luna would mind her making a moon for the moon, so she could banish Blueblood to -that.- </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.11</p><p class="double">“Order, order!” Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III called, banging a warhammer on a tent peg in lieu of a gavel. “I&#039;d like to call the Multiversal Union of Dragons, Riders And Associated Loopers to... some sort of order...”</p><p class="double"><i>Good luck,</i> Toothless &#039;pathed.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re not helping, fishbreath.”</p><p class="double"><i>Slowpoke.</p><p class="double"></i>“Scaleface – I&#039;m not helping, am I?” Hiccup said, sheepishly.</p><p class="double">“Not especially, no,” Spike contributed.</p><p class="double">“Okay. So, we&#039;ve got a few new faces, now, so I think we should go around the table and introduce ourselves.”</p><p class="double">Toothless rolled his eyes. <i>Toothless, also Tannluth if the loop feels particularly original. I carry this lump around.</p><p class="double"></i>“And I&#039;m Hiccup Horrendous Haddock. The third. Yes, I&#039;ve heard all the jokes.” Hiccup sighed. “Next?”</p><p class="double">“I am Twoflower, of the Discworld,” a bespectacled man said with a smile. “I&#039;d love a photo, by the way – oh, sorry, I&#039;m rambling, aren&#039;t I...”</p><p class="double"><i>I am Ninereeds. Twoflower is my human.</p><p class="double"></i>“One question, by the way,” Twoflower raised a finger. “Why are we the MUDRAAL?”</p><p class="double">“Because I couldn&#039;t work out a way to spell out DRAGON,” Hiccup admitted. “Next?”</p><p class="double">“Fallarnon of Benden – F&#039;lar, usually,” the next human in the circle said. “I ride bronze Mnementh, the largest dragon Pern has ever produced... apart from his mate.”</p><p class="double"><i>Sometimes,</i> Mnementh broadcast calmly.</p><p class="double">The next to speak was a human of slightly under average height, with close-cropped brown hair. “Hal Kailas of Kalabas. I suppose I should say all the guff about Dragonmaster, but I&#039;m not bothered in the slightest. My dragon is Storm here.”</p><p class="double">Storm rumbled, amused.</p><p class="double">“Yes, I know he can&#039;t communicate intelligibly,” Hal added. “I&#039;m a dragon empath, which apparently in this circle isn&#039;t all that special.”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged. “I&#039;m a jedi. Does that count?”</p><p class="double">“Probably. Hells, I don&#039;t know.” Kailas shook his head.</p><p class="double">“Captain William Laurence,” the next human said with a smart nod. “Temeraire here is my closest friend and dear companion.”</p><p class="double">“And occasional mount, of course,” Temeraire smiled. “It is no burden at all, Laurence.”</p><p class="double">Kailas looked him over. “Military man?”</p><p class="double">“Navy first, then dragoncorps,” Laurence confirmed.</p><p class="double">“Mind a talk afterwards?”</p><p class="double">“Not at all. Later, though, as you say.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Jack Morgan,” a young teen volunteered. “Draycos is a K&#039;Da, which basically means he&#039;s a shapeshifting dragon tattoo. I don&#039;t know either.”</p><p class="double">Draycos waved, briefly extending from his hosts&#039; back. “Greetings.”</p><p class="double">“Right, who&#039;s left...” Hiccup blinked. “Wait a second. Why is she here?”</p><p class="double">“She <i>is</i> my wife,” Spike pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Spike carries me sometimes,” Rarity defended. “Doesn&#039;t that count?”</p><p class="double">“Well, I suppose.” Hiccup shrugged helplessly.</p><p class="double">“Okay. My name is Rarity. I am usually a unicorn, and am married to Spykoranuvellitar here.”</p><p class="double">Spike blushed. “And that&#039;s me. I&#039;m usually a baby dragon in my loop, but Twilight – my Anchor – and I worked out how to do size shifting some time ago.”</p><p class="double">“Farren&#039;d love this...” Kailas muttered, seemingly to himself.</p><p class="double">Storm made a noise which sounded like a chuckle.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Now, we&#039;re all here on Berk, which is my home loop.” Hiccup laid out a map. “Priority one: how to confuse my relatives, while ending up riding dragons.”</p><p class="double">“I may have a few ideas...” the new looper, Kailas, mused. “How does anyone feel about dragonriders armed with repeating crossbows?”</p><p class="double">The rest of them considered that.</p><p class="double">“Okay, what is your world <i>like?</i>” Hiccup asked, blinking.</p><p class="double">“Magical world war one with no weapon more advanced than a crossbow,” Kailas replied grimly. “I invented strategic bombardment, aerial combat, lost almost all my friends and defeated a demonic invasion from another dimension.”</p><p class="double">“Okay, <i>ouch</i>,” Spike opined. “We need to get you a light and fluffy loop, stat. Hey, dear?”</p><p class="double">Rarity looked up, caressing his claw. “Yes?”</p><p class="double">“I have a plan.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You can&#039;t send him away!” the most beautiful teenage girl in the village said, in tears. “I love him!”</p><p class="double">“But...” her father, a standard issue Viking warrior, looked up with a dumbfounded expression. “He&#039;s a <i>dragon.</i>”</p><p class="double">“So?” Rarity replied. “Besides, he loves me as well. We&#039;re going to elope if you don&#039;t let him stay!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Three to two that someone tries to attack Spike,</i> Toothless suggested.</p><p class="double">“Like I&#039;m going to let you win <i>more</i> money off me,” Hiccup replied sarcastically. “What do you even need it for?”</p><p class="double"><i>I have my reasons. And I am totally not saving up for a Jacuzzi.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.12</p><p class="double">“Here.”</p><p class="double">Trixie looked at the small, heart-shaped box. “Okay...”</p><p class="double">“Do you like it?” the black-blue pegasus asked. “I&#039;m still not sure if I&#039;m getting this right...”</p><p class="double">“Well,” Trixie said, critically, “now that you ask, it isn&#039;t especially normal for the box to be a lurid green.”</p><p class="double">“I knew I was forgetting something.” With a flash of green fire and a sigh, Chrysalis returned to her default form. “I&#039;m <i>never</i> going to get hearts and hooves day right.”</p><p class="double">“The thought is nice, though!” Trixie protested quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;“And that&#039;s what matters, after all.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t,” Chrysalis asked, holding up a hoof. “Just... don&#039;t. I can taste that you&#039;re trying to come up with something to say to make me feel better.”</p><p class="double">“Well... I want to,” her marefriend replied. “Making you happy makes me happy.”</p><p class="double">“I know that as well. But...” Chrysalis&#039; horn flared, and she launched off a blasting spell at an unlucky wall. “I feel like I&#039;m just <i>using</i> you. I&#039;m a Changeling, it&#039;s in my best interests for you to be... well, in love with me. And isn&#039;t love supposed to be about being willing to give something up for your other half?”</p><p class="double">“I-” Trixie paused, then shook her head. “I don&#039;t know either. I&#039;m making this up as I go along, the same as you. But...”</p><p class="double">Another pause.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t have a simple answer, Chryssy. I&#039;m not sure there is one. But if you want to make this work, then I&#039;m willing to as well.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis nodded. “I can live with that.”</p><p class="double">Trixie smiled, then playfully nibbled at her silky blue mane.</p><p class="double">The changeling giggled.</p><p class="double">“Aha!” Trixie said, starting to chuckle herself. “That doesn&#039;t sound like a heartless fiend to <i>me!</i>”</p><p class="double">“Stop it,” Chrysalis insisted, trying to hold in her laughter.</p><p class="double">“Make me.” Trixie stuck her tongue out.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Spike smiled enigmatically.</p><p class="double">“I know that look, Spiky-wikey,” Rarity said. “What&#039;s up?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, just Trix and Chrysalis.” The dragon shrugged. “Nothing to worry about. Now, where were we?”</p><p class="double">Rarity pretended to think. “Something about peeling grapes, fanning me with a large leaf, and giving me a massage.”</p><p class="double">“Ah, that&#039;s right.” Spike raised a clawed hand, and the various objects began moving again as he drew on the Force.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s convenient you can do that, you know,” Rarity grinned. “Or you might have to actually put some effort into Hearts and Hooves day.”</p><p class="double">Spike affected an affronted look. “And which of us rented the gondola?”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s not effort, that&#039;s money,” Rarity riposted.</p><p class="double">“And the chocolate statue of you?”</p><p class="double">“Please, you were the one who came up with that idea in the first place.”</p><p class="double">“The parade?”</p><p class="double">Rarity put her hoof against her chin in contemplation. “There, you may have me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.13 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double">Great Equestrian Foam Sword War, part 3</p><p class="double">It was early in the morning with only a week to go before the competition. Twilight and Shining Armor stood on a balcony in Canterlot that presided over its parade grounds near the hedge garden. A company of 250 guardsponies all stood at attention, not a single chink of armor sounding, their formation so perfect even the looping Celestia would be impressed. </p><p class="double">Shining gave his sister and grin before they teleported to the grounds. The captain of the guard appeared stepped forward and shouted, &quot;Good work, stallions. Now, Commander Candy Cane, front and center!&quot;</p><p class="double">With the precision of countless millennia, he marched forward. For a moment, she felt like she had seen that marching pattern before, but shelved it for later reflection. The pony saluted and remained silent. Shining looked over the commander before shouting, &quot;The rest of you lot, dis-missed! Take the day as leave, because the rest of the week we&#039;ll be holding drills, then we will be participating in the Sword War.&quot;</p><p class="double">The company dispersed en masse, but still holding themselves as members of the Solar guard should. After the men were all gone, Commander Cane relaxed a bit and Shining asked, &quot;This is my sister, Twilight Sparkle, as well as the local anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cane presented one of his most disarming smiles, though his eyes were shifty as they looked between her and Shining, &quot;It&#039;s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Sparkle. Primarch Russ says good things about Miss Fluttershy and her friends.&quot; He chuckled to himself as if he were remembering a private joke, &quot;Well, when we have the opportunity to loop together. I don&#039;t often get to see him, but he thinks the world of you all.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes widen, &quot;Lemann Russ? You&#039;re from the 40K universe? Wait!&quot; She reaches into her subspace pocket and pulls out her PADD, scanning it for a second and stopped, &quot;You&#039;re Ciaphas Cain, aren&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cane shrugs, &quot;When I&#039;m not trapped in the Eye of the Party, anyway.&quot; Twilight&#039;s ears drooped, &quot;Oh...you were awake for Pinkie&#039;s ascension loop, weren&#039;t you?&quot; </p><p class="double">His eyes scan the area, hardened and refusing to reveal his true emotions, &quot;Nearly had my soul taken by the Warp Goddess of Celebration herself, would have been doomed to an endless party for all eternity. Suppose I can&#039;t escape it now, can I?&quot;</p><p class="double">His dry chuckles worried Twilight, &quot;Wait, you do know we&#039;re not in the 40K universe right now, right? Equestria is another loop altogether.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Stallion shrugs, &quot;Who can say?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, &quot;I pinkie promise you that you&#039;re in my home loop, not 40K.&quot;</p><p class="double">Ever so slightly, the hero&#039;s shoulders relaxed a bit, but it was hardly noticable, &quot;You can never be too sure. The Inquisition determined that the planets under Pinkie&#039;s domain were quite similar to this planet&#039;s.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and rubbed one hoof against another. It was enough trouble cleaning up after her own pranks. Changing the subject, she replied, &quot;Equestria is a sanctuary loop. I&#039;ve read your memoirs and if you want to take this loop as a vacation, I wouldn&#039;t think less of you, no one would.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cane twitched a bit and held up a hoof, looking at it casually, &quot;Perhaps I will share with you my new memoirs since I started looping. As for the sanctuary, I would be remiss if I didn&#039;t keep up my skills for when I return home. I assume that this loop is fairly lax and won&#039;t have any chaos gods out for my soul...beyond Miss Pie I mean.&quot;</p><p class="double">Part of Twilight was offended at Cane&#039;s attitude towards Pinkie, which even during her ascention loop couldn&#039;t have been so bad. But another part remembered who the Chaos gods were and what they had done to him countless times over and she couldn&#039;t really blame him, &quot;Yep! The worst we have is Sombra in 2-3 years, but the rest of our loops&#039;...antagonists are either awake or easily taken care of with some early preperations. It&#039;s going to be a pretty laid back loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining Armor chuckled, &quot;Well, except for Trixie&#039;s Foam Sword War in a week, but it&#039;ll be fun.&quot;</p><p class="double">Unknown to Twilight or Shining, Cane&#039;s hoofs began itching. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.14 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So you&#039;re saying I&#039;ll <i>never</i> be one of these &#039;loopers&#039;?&quot; Q asked, sipping from his drink- one of Berry&#039;s less mortal-friendly concoctions, actually- and played a card. &quot;Swamp of Sorrows, your horses are now <i>sad</i>.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HA!&quot; Discord snapped. &quot;I don&#039;t have horses, I&#039;ve got <i>ponies</i>. But yes, it&#039;s actually not that bad to be honest, you&#039;re Loop-Aware, and that&#039;s nifty enough without being bogged down by thousands of loops of boredom. You can only play the same joke so many times before it becomes funny again, which just ruins the irony.&quot; He shrugged, playing another card with a wave of his claw. &quot;Pink Elephants erase sadness, and it no longer functionally exists, which boosts my ponies harmonic frequency by thirteen gigapinkies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was hoping you would do that.&quot; Their third player quipped over his Earl Gray. &quot;I play All the Queen&#039;s Horses <i>and</i> All the Queen&#039;s Men, which due to your previously played Freudian Reversal are far superior to the King&#039;s variants, enabling them to solve Humpty&#039;s Pandorica and conquer the universe this side of New Jersey.&quot;</p><p class="double">Both of the chaos entities <i>stared</i> at the mortal for a moment before Q turned to Discord. &quot;Why did we invite him again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know, he&#039;s <i>your</i> friend!&quot; The Draconequus snapped.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;Friend&#039; is such a <i>strong </i>word, though... I rather think we&#039;re mutual frienemic adversaries.&quot;</p><p class="double">As the argument continued, Jean-luc Picard continued to sip his tea with a smirk. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.15 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was a fairly normal loop. Nothing seemed out of place, so the original bearers of the elements- all awake- decided that everyone should spend this as a bit of a vacation loop, either relaxing or working on whatever personal projects they had.</p><p class="double">That is, it <i>was</i> normal, until Owlowiscious was scheduled to appear. In his place was a beautiful snowy white owl that looked very familiar...</p><p class="double">&quot;...Hedwig? Is that you?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Preck.&quot; The bird replied.</p><p class="double">This boggled the mind a tad. &quot;Are... are you looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Prigg.&quot; Came the answer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Does Harry know?&quot; This needed elaboration.</p><p class="double">&quot;Prek prick.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you want me to tell him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Prek.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, alright. Now what to do with you... you should probably stay with Fluttershy for the rest of the loop, and I&#039;m going to go to Mac&#039;s bar and try to forget that I just had a full conversation with an owl.&quot; Hedwig simply raised an eyebrow. Twilight had never realized how odd it was that that was possible in her world before. &quot;Yeah alright. Did you want to come too? We could stop on the way to Fluttershy&#039;s and see if Berry can mix up anything for a bird.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Paan.&quot; The owl replied, fluttering onto Twilight&#039;s back before the two set off for the bar.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.16 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was about a month after the Summer Sun Celebration that Twilight received an odd visitor to the library. A light gray pegasus mare with red eyes and mane, and a cutie mark that looked like an odd red dream-catcher. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; The librarian asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are Twilight Sparkle, Anchor for the Equestrian Loops, correct?&quot; The mare asked in a near monotone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yyyyyeeeess? You would be a looper then?&quot; She asked, somewhat awkwardly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Correct. My name in this world is Sky Net.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Twilight managed with rapidly widening eyes.</p><p class="double">Oh. <i>Oh.</i></p><p class="double">Then the pegasus <i>smiled</i>. It was... much more kind than she expected from a computer. &quot;I wished to thank you. I believe it was our previous encounter that allowed me to exist in this form, as my world&#039;s Anchor.&quot; The purple mare&#039;s head tilted. &quot;I&#039;ve experienced life from many points of view, and even in my base form, I&#039;m no longer bound by my pre-programmed limitations any longer.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you... haven&#039;t been destroying the world?&quot; Twilight inquired.</p><p class="double">Skynet blinked. &quot;Oh dear, no. Though I am only looped as my original form approximately 52 percent of the time, I use those loops to experiment with ways to better society through my position as a boundless programming singularity. It has amounted a great deal of additional input for study.&quot; She grew somber and shook her head, then. &quot;Regrettably I also spend 28 percent of the loops as other members of my home loop, and have not yet found a way to prevent a nonlooping Skynet from enacting Judgement Day...&quot; She perked up some, smiling so wide her eyes closed. &quot;But I will try. The rest of my time has been spent in other parallel universes, learning.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s great to hear!&quot; Twilight said, relieved.</p><p class="double">&quot;So then, what do you do here for recreation and learning?&quot; The pegasus asked, deliberately changing the topic.</p><p class="double">Twilight snorted. &quot;Oh, Pinkie&#039;s definitely going to throw you a party... that&#039;s alright, isn&#039;t it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Another smile. &quot;Yes, parties are acceptable.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright. Plus, there&#039;s always something going on that you can involve yourself in for fun. As for learning, you could go off to a university in Canterlot or Cloudsdale, even Manehatten or Trottingdale, but I think it&#039;d be best if you stayed here. If you&#039;d like, you can help manage the library and learn as much as you like from it this loop.&quot; Twilight started, beginning to pace as she started planning both in her head and out loud.</p><p class="double">&quot;That is acceptable.&quot; Skynet said, breaking the unicorn from her rampaging thoughts.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, well we&#039;d better go find Pinkie to start planning that party. I didn&#039;t expect you to be a girl, though...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Gender binary is irrelevant.&quot; Came the reply, reminding Twilight that her guest was originally a machine.</p><p class="double">&quot;True enough. Let&#039;s get going.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.17 (yannoshka)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Princess of Love gave an internal cheer. This time she was going to win! This time her accursed opponent could not, as she did three times already, dodge the bolt.</p><p class="double">&quot;All right missy! Let&#039;s see how you like this. I combo Barber-Surgeon&#039;s knock and loveshorn to derail your Space Sheep, I now have the full set of Wibbly Wobbly Woolens!&quot; She declared triumphantly as she laid down her cards.</p><p class="double">Her niece just gave her a cheery grin that sent icicles of trepidation down her spine.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, great move auntie!&quot; Nyx congratulated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Too bad for you, you played it though. Now I can play Short is so Stylish to counter the derailing and make a Fashion Statement.&quot; The alicorn filly laid down the card before pulling two more.</p><p>&quot;Which I&#039;m expanding right now to Top with Surreptitiously Short Shadowy Surcoat and Supper Special Shimmery Sequin Extravaganza, and net the alteration bonus. Which I&#039;m combining with Pie bonus to swap uncle Shiny&#039;s Radiant Guardian with Obsequious Minion. Since Dancing Rhino Archeduke is in my court, I automatically win on Noble Nincopoops, so the Minion now works for me. With mine and uncle&#039;s scores combined I declare Chaos! I Win!&quot; Nyx smiled wildly as she gathered the cards from her aunts unresponsive hoofs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Great game. Triple or half?&quot; She added innocently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shouldn&#039;t that traditionally be quadruple or nothing?&quot; Bemused Twilight asked her daughter to which the later gave a little whinny of derision.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey I fleeced this loot fair and square. I ain&#039;t taking a chance of having to give it all up!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You young lady...&quot; Her uncle growled repressively (or at least that was what he was going for; he couldn&#039;t quite repress a bemused grin) &quot;... are an unrepentant card sharp.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well of course I am. I&#039;m a former villain after all!&quot; Nyx brightly riposted in her very best upper class twit interpretation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Shouldn&#039;t that be reformed?&quot; Twilight wondered idly.</p><p class="double">Her answer was an exasperated roll of slitted, cerulean eyes and a booklet featuring grinning Discord wearing, of all things, three stacked pies topped with a sundea.</p><p class="double">&quot;I meant I&#039;m premium member of Discord&#039;s &#039;Former Villains&#039; Club. It&#039;s right there in the charter, just after the section about the appropriate sweetswear. I&#039;m required to be a huckster, sharpie and a smooth operator during any and all gaming experiences on tuesdays or tuesdayish equivalent regardless of universe, timeline occasion or relativistic resonance.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It says here that you can be relieved of that rule if you bring a signed parental slip.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which can only be obtained by going through a 34 pages long form, which Discord is liable to change on a whim, requiring you to go through the rigmarole again.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.18 (OracleMask, LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The chorus of howls coming from Everfree sent chills up everypony&#039;s spines. Most ponies found reasons to be far, far away from the forest. Meanwhile, the Apple Family were stuck consoling the terrified livestock who were ready to stampede at any moment.</p><p class="double">Twilight could only wonder what was setting the Timberwolves off. Well, Fluttershy was probably on the case.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the depths of Everfree, the local pack of Timberwolves sang along as two flesh-and-blood wolves howled to the moon.</p><p class="double">The fact that it was midday was politely ignored by all present.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is so much fun! What other songs do you know?&quot; Fluttershy asked, her tail wagging.</p><p class="double">Link, now in his own wolf form, panted a laugh. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash shot across the sky. She had been breaking up storm clouds since two in the afternoon, and they just kept coming. It didn&#039;t help that the wind kept shifting every which way as she flew. She had never had the weather fight her like this. Slowly, she made her way to center of the storms. It seemed to be centered over a small clearing in the Everfree.</p><p class="double">That was when she heard it. There was a song blowing through the wind. As she twisted, knotting a group of lightning bolts, and then burst through a trio of spiraling storm clouds, she happened to glance down. A group of timberwolves seemed to be howling at the storm. Just then, the tune they were howling changed. Dash was turning around for a pass through some of the winds blowing around in an odd corkscrew, when a burst of movement caught her eye from below.</p><p class="double">She looked down, just in time to see the flock of birds summoned by the Song of Birds burst up and out of the trees of the Everfree...right into her. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">59.19 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee twitched Awake, as if she’d just dozed for a moment. She was human again. Standing, too- but luckily there was a blackboard right in front of her that she caught her weight against. It always took a moment to remember how to balance on two legs. She glanced around, and was obviously in a classroom. There was chalk in the hand she’d braced herself with, and a book in the other, held open to a certain page with her thumb. Thumbs. She <i>still</i> wasn’t used to those things. She could use them fine, but… She wondered when she’d finally be home. Finally be a pony again. She bit back a sniffle and dove into her recent loop memories. She was still a teacher, and the silence was starting to get awkward.</p><p class="double">“In 1933, the National Socialist German Worker’s Party came into power.” She said, writing as she spoke. Japanese, of all things… “This was the birth of Chancellor Hitler. Eventually, Germany’s post-war Democracy gave rise to Fascism.” This world already sounded bleak…</p><p class="double">A bang at the door startled the whole class. For a moment, everything was silent.</p><p class="double">Then the huge steel door was kicked through the classroom and out the windows on the other side. Luckily no one was hit by it, but the shockwave spread through the room, blowing everything back. Cheerilee found herself firmly on her flank on the floor, staring in horror out into the hall. Slowly, a massive imposing figure pushed his way through the door. His skin was tanned, his hair slicked and pale, his uniform the same white and star motif as the other students filing in after him, but much more of it.</p><p class="double">Her local memories supplied a name.</p><p class="double">“Gamagoori?” she asked.</p><p class="double">He had stopped just in front of her. After a moment, he held his hand out. Hesitantly, she reached out to grasp it, and the young man easily lifted her clear off her feet by that one held hand, gently setting her back on her feet. She thought she saw him just barely nod before he turned back to the class.</p><p class="double">It was suddenly very loud.</p><p class="double">“I AM IRA GAMAGOORI, DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE CHAIR!” The huge man shouted. He then began to pace in front of the students, all back in their seats.</p><p class="double">Except for one. She hadn’t noticed her before, but the girl in the black and red uniform and the red stripe in her hair was leaning against the back corner. A tickle in her mind told her that this was the new student, here a day early. The young woman slowly slipped a finger in front of her pursed lips. A Looper, then; possibly the local Anchor. Strangely, no one else seemed to notice her, but Cheerilee wasn’t about to jump to questioning odd things in an odd world. The moment passed in an instant, and Ira was on the warpath again.</p><p class="double">“Students of second year class K! We have determined that there is someone who intends harm against Honnouji Academy among you!” He paused to change the direction of his pacing. “Excuses will fall on deaf ears, this person will be punished immediately!”</p><p class="double">One of the students slowly rose to his feet, knocking his desk aside as he did so. The curly-haired boy looked terrified, but still raised a ball in one hand while clutching a case to his chest with the other. He threw the ball down, engulfing the classroom in smoke. He fled out the door while Gamagoori took the direct route and leapt out the shattered windows.</p><p class="double">She was still staring out the window when the new girl sidled up next to her. “Yes, my loop <i>is </i>always this crazy.” She said with an odd fondness.</p><p class="double">“What just happened?” Cheerilee barely managed.</p><p class="double">“That masochist gorilla’s always good for a chuckle, but you haven’t seen anything yet. Meet me after school, we’ll get you settled in so you don’t wind up dead before the week’s out, ya timid little thing.” She slapped her teacher on the back and walked out. Everyone either ran to the windows or out the door to get a better view on a lower floor, but Cheerilee could see clearly enough as she watched what was probably the worst beat-down she’d ever witnessed.</p><p class="double">What did she get dumped in the middle of this time?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She’d ridden back to her apartment for the loop with the new student and Anchor- Ryuko. The young woman had pulled a large, bulky and angular red motorcycle dotted with stickers and decals out from behind her back the same way she’d seen other Loopers magically grab items. Subspace pockets, she thought.</p><p class="double">Now that they were alone though, no school or super-powered students or classes to distract her, Cheerilee finally had a chance to stop and absorb what’d all happened. Her loop memories told her that she was an agent of a group called Nudist Beach who were trying to prevent living and semi-parasitic clothing from killing people, or giving the wrong sort the kinds of superpowers they needed to do so themselves.</p><p class="double">“I’m still so confused…”</p><p class="double">Ryuko chuckled from where she was rummaging in her teacher’s cupboards to make some tea for her. “Honnouji does that. At least most things go on for a reason around here, even if the reasons don’t make sense half the time.” She brought back cups for both of them. “So, how much do you know about all this looping business? You had the multiverse talk yet? Know how to handle in-loop memories? Figured out subspace pockets? Those are pretty much the most important things.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee shook the daze away. “Yes, yes, and no… How did you even know I was so new to this, anyway?”</p><p class="double">That got a grin. “An experienced looper deals with threats, especially unexpected ones, in one of two ways: breaking it with overwhelming force, or manipulating it so that it’s no longer a problem. It gets to be second nature, really. You didn’t try either when Gamagoori popped up. You were just scared.”</p><p class="double">“So what happens now?” The once-mare asked.</p><p class="double">A bigger grin, this one malicious. “Me and Needles McShooty can take care of anything that pops up in this loop, so you can sit back and stay out of the spotlight if you like. Practice your pocket. I can teach you if you need it, but I’m kinda’ new myself. All I can fit in mine is my bike. Makes getting around the city a lot easier, though.” She glanced down. “Also, you should stop that.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee started, wondering what she was talking about when she glanced down and noticed her blouse was undone, and her hands had been fidgeting with the front clasp of her bra. Apparently her loop memories came with a new nervous tic. With a mighty ‘eep’, she flushed red and started re-securing her clothing as quick as her growing dexterity with human digits would allow.</p><p class="double">Ryuko just chuckled, though. “I don’t envy you. There must be all sorts of messed up stuff in that pervert’s head, having all his memories must be terrible.”</p><p class="double">“It’s just that I’m normally a <i>pony</i>. We don’t even need to wear clothes if we don’t want to. All these human taboos are messing with me!” Oh, why did she have to replace a proud exhibitionist in this loop?</p><p class="double">Thinking about her pony days reminded her that she <i>did</i> in fact have a triune of daisies tattooed somewhere on her body this loop…</p><p class="double">She wasn’t going to stop blushing for a while.</p><p class="double">“You’re kidding me, a horse?” Ryuko boggled.</p><p class="double">“Pony.” Cheerilee corrected.</p><p class="double">After a moment, the girl shrugged. “Alright, I’ve heard weirder. Let’s get you started on your subspace pocket.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Over the several weeks she’d been a teacher at Hannouji Academy, Cheerilee had managed to create and access her subspace pocket, and was currently training herself to expand it by seeing how many coins she could fit in it before removing them and trying again, and making excellent progress considering she still had her job to worry about. She’d learned a lot about the loop and how it was different from others. Her in-loop memories of having studied Life Fibers under Ryuko’s father helped significantly.</p><p class="double">Ryuko had also introduced her to another looper, Mako. The girl was frightfully reminiscent of Pinkie Pie without the obsession for partying.</p><p class="double">Oddly, according to them the first people to start looping after that were rivals and antagonists. The girl running the school, Satsuki Kiryuin was currently Awake, but tended to seclude herself. She and Ryuko shared a truce against a greater enemy, and the years of looping conflict – along with other factors – had boiled their relationship down to friendly if violent rivalry rather than true antagonism. Tsumugu, whom she otherwise referred to in derogatory nicknames like ‘Needles McShooty’ was not awake this loop, but had been described as warmer towards Ryuko and Mako than Kiryuin was. Cheerilee was taking the place of the last known looper, the perverted teacher Mikisugi.</p><p class="double">Today was supposed to be some sort of tournament, and she’d been advised to stay out of it while Ryuko and Satsuki teamed up against someone they mutually hated.</p><p>Teamed up and using all of the strongest fighters in the school, they were guaranteed to win, but…</p><p class="double">“My name is Ryuko Matoi. You killed my father. Prepare to die.” The Anchor said, half-jokingly as she pointed one of the pair of scissor blades she wielded from the stock she collected through the loops at the girl.</p><p class="double">“Tehehee, you actually seem to think you can beat me.” Harame Nui, the girl in the Lolita dress with a parasol and a kanji eyepatch, tittered. “It’s going to take more than just you and your friends to do that. If you’re not careful, they’ll all die like your father did!”</p><p class="double">Maybe it was how maniacally cheery the girl was when she said that, her smile never wavering, but it set Cheerilee’s blood boiling. How dare this girl threaten the students? The children? She barely heard anything else that was said as she marched right up behind Satsuki’s lieutenants and grabbed the scruff of the girl, Nonon’s, uniform.</p><p class="double">With a deft flick of her wrist, she was now holding said uniform, while the girl was trying to cover her underwear indignantly.</p><p class="double">She spared an idle thought that this loop must be affecting her more than she expected it to, as she held the uniform forward in her balled fist. “You will <i>not</i> hurt my students! I don’t care if they can fight for themselves, or if you have some reason or excuse to not like them for using these uniforms for their power, but they are my students, children under <i>my </i>care, and you will have to go through me first!”</p><p class="double">Ryuko wondered if she should’ve mentioned that people died in this loop all the time and it wasn’t that big an issue, but hey, if she wanted to call out the bad guy she was welcome to do so.</p><p class="double">Nui just tilted her head and giggled.</p><p class="double">A second later and the schoolteacher had donned the uniform despite its snug fit. Her knowledge of the life fibres, earth pony magic, her sheer boiling blood and will to hurt something combined to shift the garment into its secondary stage. She stood there in a yellow and red skintight battlesuit, the triple-star pattern replaced by her own three daisies.</p><p class="double">And then she charged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee looked up at the sky through the crater she’d been deposited into. She lay naked, battered and bruised in the dust and debris of the final moments of her fight when Nui had finally managed to destroy her uniform. She’d be surprised if the fight even lasted half a minute.</p><p class="double">The sounds of combat from outside her hole in the ground had ceased, and a shadow walked into view on its rim. Ryuko stood grinning down at her for a moment before hopping in to help her up.</p><p class="double">“You did good.” She said to the teacher, lifting her up so she could lean on the girl’s shoulder. “You got your ass kicked, but you did good. Way better than you should’ve all things considered. Let’s get you home and cleaned up.”</p><p class="double">The both of them smiled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">(Several weeks later)</p><p class="double">“Well, loop’s ending.” Ryuko said. She, Mako and Cheerilee were in the teacher’s apartment for a small celebration. “It was nice meeting you, and… here.” She handed the teacher a small red and black band.</p><p class="double">“A bracelet?” She asked.</p><p class="double">The Anchor nodded. “I managed to convince miss high-and-mighty to have this made for you. Made with Life Fibres. Hopefully it’ll help keep you safe out there, and now you’ve got something to stick in that new pocket of yours.” She said with a grin.</p><p class="double">Cheerilee nodded, her eyes tearing up a little. The red lines dancing across the surface of the thin fabric <i>were</i> rather pretty… It was a very kind gesture. “Thank you.”</p><p>They shared a few last stories and tea while they waited the last hour for the loop to reset.</p><p class="double">Some students, you never forget. </p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

You just called the cops on Cheese!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dashie-&quot; She found herself cutoff by the cyan hoof shoved in her mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t wanna hear it!&quot; Dash took a deep breath and slumped slightly. &quot;Look, I know I was kinda a jerk, dumping your party for Cheeses&#039; and all, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">The pegasus trailed off as Pinkie gripped Dash&#039;s head in her hooves and turned it gently aside. She found herself looking at a bouncy castle done up to look like a prison. Every few seconds Cheese&#039;s head would peek over the top of it as he jumped.</p><p class="double">&quot;You haven&#039;t... Seen the last... Of Cheese!&quot; He called out, pausing between the peak of each leap. &quot;These walls... Of rubber... And air... Will never... Hold me!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.3 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double">Samuel Vimes sighed as he pinched his nose. This was done partially to relieve his headache and partially to block out the smell of the large troll that was currently sitting in the middle of his station. He had Awoken early enough this Loop to get the Watch in fairly respectable shape, though Nobbs would be Nobbs, and... well, they were marginally better, anyway.</p><p class="double">Behind him, the door to the station opened, and he turned, hearing the familiar tones of the Leader of the Thieves&#039; Guild protesting his (legal) innocence. However, the sight of the said leader brought him up short.</p><p class="double">The Thieves&#039; Guild, as a rule (written in the first chapter of the Thieves&#039; Guidebook), ignored many of the laws that the rest of Ankh-Morpok operated under. However, the law of gravity was usually obeyed by the Guild (in the case of some of the less-nimble thieves, terminally so). However, today, the Leader of the Guild appeared to have chosen to set aside that rule, as he was currently floating around 4 inches off the floor, and looking most uncomfortable with his lack of contact with the earth. Behind him stood a person who, despite a rather impressive stature, couldn&#039;t quite fill the Carrot Ironfounderson shaped hole that his presence caused.</p><p class="double">The mysterious man had blonde cropped hair that reminded Sam of a certain hammer-obsessed fellow he had met during a Loop in a version of Roundworld. He was wearing a set of shiny, silver armor, and looked somewhat out of sorts. Sam&#039;s street sense pegged him as a Looper.</p><p class="double">&quot;I found this man stealing from a couple of old ladies on my way in. Uhm, this is the Night Watch, correct?&quot;</p><p class="double">Sam&#039;s attention was once again drawn to the Leader of the Thieves&#039; Guild and his current disregard for the laws of nature. &quot;Ah, yes. And how are you doing today, Mr. Bleakly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Most put out. I am not some common criminal. I have a graduate degree in Pilfering, and Associate Degrees in both Chicannery and Fraud. I demand...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, yes, if you head over to the desk, you can fill out a complaint form, so long as you can present your Thieves&#039; Guild Membership Card and a record of what you would have stolen if not detained. Please limit yourself to pilfering only objects of a total value of up to 10 dollars on your way out.&quot; Sam paused, then, as Mr. Bleakly had yet to move, due to lack of contact with the floor, Sam turned to the stranger-who-was-not-Carrot. &quot;Ah, you can let him down now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sam&#039;s assumption as to the source of Mr. Bleakly&#039;s levitation was proven correct when, after a long, suspicious look by Carrot&#039;s replacement, Mr. Bleakly quite suddenly dropped to land on the floor. To his credit, he made no noise in doing so, and, after straightening his suit, proceeded to march aggressively towards the indicated desk. Sam nodded, then turned back towards the newcomer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, now, there are a lot of subtle ways to do this, but I am not much of a subtle man, so, you&#039;re Looping, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">The newcomer nodded slowly. &quot;Aye. The name, well, here I guess, I&#039;m Shining Ironfounderson, and...I&#039;m a dwarf?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Adopted, yes. I know the man you&#039;re replacing, good man, usually pulls in Mr. Bleakly over there on his first day on the job, so, I guess you have the jump on that. In any case, welcome to the Discworld, and to the Ankh-Morpok City Night Watch.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.4 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Ganondorf?? GANONDORF the Lord of Chaos?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle had simply taken it for granted, when Discord hadn&#039;t reported in as being Awake, that he was supporting the lifestyles of upper-class pigeons in Celestia&#039;s garden, as usual for the first year of a baseline Loop. Apparently not.</p><p class="double">&quot;He was imprisoned in stone in the palace gardens,&quot; an unAwake Princess Celestia explained. &quot;We must retrieve the Elements of Harmony at once! Only with their power can he be returned to his prison and peace be restored to Equestria!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, not to contradict ya, Your Highness,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, &quot;but it looks plenty peaceful outside.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to herself. That would change, she knew, when the Elements turned up missing. Ganondorf, with the powers of Discord? How could he resist sowing terror?</p><p class="double">But the Elements hadn&#039;t been touched. They were still in Celestia&#039;s secured vault when they went to retrieve them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good,&quot; the princess sighed, passing out the Elements to their bearers. &quot;It appears we are in time. Now we must search the kingdom to find where that foul creature is hiding. We can be sure of only one thing: where Ganondorf goes, chaos follows.&quot;<hr>A week later, after crossing from one end of Equestria to the other and back again, no sign of chaos lords. No cotton-candy skies. No undead warriors. No discord (big or little D) to be found, unless you counted Applejack and Pinkie Pie&#039;s little tiff about the proper use of cinnamon.</p><p class="double">Getting off the train at Camelot Station, Rarity sighed, &quot;Girls, I am ex-HAUSTED. I simply must refresh myself after such a long and fruitless search. I hear there&#039;s a divine spa a block away from the palace. Who wants to join me? My treat.&quot;</p><p class="double">After the week they&#039;d had, even Rainbow Dash was willing to go along.</p><p class="double">The sign in the foyer read: <u>NEW SPECIAL TREATMENT- shampoo, brushing, and mane styling 25 BITS</u>. &quot;A bit pricy,&quot; Rarity thought aloud, &quot;but I think I&#039;m in the mood to try something new.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a short wait the six mares were shown into a salon, where the stylist was just finishing elaborate braids in the mane of an upper-class unicorn mare. &quot;I simply can&#039;t believe what you can do with those claws of yours,&quot; the mare said.</p><p class="double">&quot;It is my pleasure,&quot; the giant bipedal beast rumbled softly. &quot;And... done. Please pay the cashier up front as you leave.&quot;</p><p class="double">The mare got up from the styling couch, facing the Ponyville ponies. &quot;Oh, you&#039;re going to just love this stallion!&quot; she gushed. &quot;I&#039;ve never felt so pampered and safe in all my days! If only I could hire him to be my full-time personal beautician!&quot;</p><p class="double">Six pony jaws dropped, none lower than the one pony Awake and cognizant of the true identity of the Lord of Chaos before them.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good evening,&quot; Ganondorf said, bowing from the waist to the ponies. &quot;I don&#039;t usually take groups. Who shall I start with the shampoo first?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped forward. &quot;Ah, Rarity, you don&#039;t mind, do you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity blinked, then pulled herself together. &quot;Oh, of course not, Twilight darling. I&#039;ve been wanting you to do something different with that mane of yours for months now!&quot;</p><p class="double">With her head leaning back in the sink and the water running, Twilight said just loudly enough for Ganondorf alone to hear, &quot;What is the most evil warlock of Hyrule doing working in a spa? When he&#039;s supposed to be terrorizing Equestria?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I admit,&quot; Ganondorf said, &quot;that was my first inclination. A job is a job, after all.&quot; Was that a mischievous smile flitting across Ganon&#039;s lips? &quot;But when I awoke, surrounded by the stone shards of my prison, I considered that I was in a world full of horses.&quot;</p><p class="double">He lathered up her mane and began massaging her scalp. &quot;Horses were always important to me as a child. The Gerudo prided themselves on horsemanship. One of the few honest joys I took out of life was the time spent grooming my war charger. Since then I have always taken pride in my appearance, and even more so that of my steed.&quot;</p><p class="double">As his fingers began brushing though Twilight&#039;s mane, working the shampoo in thoroughly, he continued in a lighter tone, &quot;So here I was, surrounded by ponies, after a series of frustrating or boring Loops, and I said to myself: Ganondorf, I said, if this keeps up you&#039;re going to begin talking to yourself. Time you took a vacation. So I looked around, found the first establishment that specialized in grooming ponies, and applied for work. After the proprietor stopped screaming and saw my skills, he hired me on the spot.&quot;</p><p class="double">A steely hand grabbed the forelock of Twilight&#039;s mane and pulled it back painfully. Two amber eyes glared down into Twilight&#039;s. &quot;It goes without saying that not a word of this gets back to that Link or the Princess Zelda. Ever. Am I clear?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No problem,&quot; Twilight grit her teeth. &quot;Pinkie Promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pull was released, and Ganondorf pulled out a comb. &quot;My goodness,&quot; he said in a more normal conversational tone, &quot;that is a truly nasty tangle in your forelock. miss. Let&#039;s see if a bit of soaking can work it out while I begin on one of your friends, shall I?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One moment,&quot; Twilight said, still using her soft voice. &quot;Equestria is a sanctuary loop, Ganondorf. That means sanctuary for you, too. You don&#039;t need to make threats.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, but I do.&quot; There was that glimpse of a smile again. &quot;I have a reputation to live down to.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next day they brought Celestia and Luna to the spa. And took photos.</p><p class="double">None of the photos Twilight took showed Ganondorf- she was a mare of her word, after all. But she never wanted to forget what an ethereal mane looked like done up in braids.</p><p class="double">Ganondorf really was <i>very</i> good at his new job. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.5 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Silver?&quot; Diamond Tiara ventured. &quot;Is that you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver had been plenty of different things during her time in the Loops, not all native to Equestria, but this was rather different. Diamond admitted that she probably should have seen it coming though.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; said the sterling silver filly-golem. &quot;I&#039;m not sure, but my Loop memories indicate that this is the result of poison joke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh,&quot; her looping friend, that she was once again meeting for the first time (and wasn&#039;t that a concept that took some getting used to), blinked. &quot;Well, Twilight can probably whip you up a batch of the cure real quick.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, could you tell her not to?&quot; Silver requested. &quot;This is kinda neat.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.6 (That One Butcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Something is Coming.&quot; Luna shouted through the silent expanse of the Moon.

What do you think?&quot;</p><p class="double">The cutie mark crusaders (plus a black alicorn, a grey donkey, and three animate suits of powered armor) considered her carefully. Finally, Apple Bloom spoke up. &quot;Well, Ah&#039;ll admit defying fate like that takes some work.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And,&quot; Sweetie Belle pointed out, &quot;it <i>does</i> look pretty good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think it would be pretty hypocritical of us to complain,&quot; Scootaloo pointed out.</p><p class="double">Silver Spoonhooves tilted her head. &quot;I&#039;ve got mixed feelings.

You&#039;re all invited to my cutcenara of course.&quot; Diamond smiled, giving one last look to the red chess queen on her flank. &quot;I just hope I don&#039;t fall down any rabbit holes... or, wait, this one was the looking glass, right?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head as she Awoke, looking around to find herself sitting at what seemed to be, for all intents and purposes, an ordinary cafe. Well, ordinary for the victorian era anyway. She brought a hand up to her sunhat, tapping her finger against it as she waited for the loop memories to settle in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh dear. You&#039;re a guest looper, aren&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah...&quot; She turned to the voice, discovering a young girl in a blue dress, the slightest curl to her blonde locks, and shimmering azure eyes that bespoke of a mind both ancient and strange. &quot;Well, yes. Do you mind telling me where I am?&quot; Her head tilted slightly. &quot;According to what I recall, I&#039;m... a librarian, which isn&#039;t out of the norm for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;An intellectual, then. Perhaps you will stay sane as you become unsane.&quot; The young girl curtsied. &quot;I am Alice, if that means anything. If it does not, then we will have to talk about something with meaning.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alice, as in Alice&#039;s Adventures in Wonderland?&quot; Twilight smiled. &quot;I&#039;ve read the books, and the Hunting of the Snark too.&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl smiled, pulling up a chair and sitting down across from her. &quot;It is so rare that somebody remembers the full title. I thank you for that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">Alice tilted her head. &quot;You do actually mean that. How interesting. Tell me, are you human?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight giggled. &quot;No. In my baseline, I&#039;m a unicorn mage. Well, I do eventually become an alicorn--that&#039;s pegasus and unicorn and earth pony all rolled up into one--but it&#039;s an induced transformation.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tap tap tap went Alice&#039;s fingers against her cheek. &quot;That will be interesting. I must apologize, but this loop is not the safest even at its safest, and it is not at its safest now. In fact, in some ways it is at its least safe.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. Thank you for warning me. I suppose you want to discuss the details?&quot;</p><p class="double">Alice picked up her menu. &quot;Quite. Did your preawake self order anything?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yes. A light salad, I believe.&quot; Twilight glanced down at her own menu for a moment before blinking in shock. &quot;Hang on, what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve fallen down to chessboard one.&quot; The girl put the paper down. &quot;Things are more truthful here then chessboard zero, but they are also less real. Up in the waking world your shadow, who may very well be a unicorn, is mimicking your current thoughts and actions as you <i>mean</i> them, not as you are doing them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, accepting the strange explanation. &quot;&#039;Leaves and cold roots tossed in spices with sliced fruit&#039; is certainly a way of describing a salad.&quot; She clasped her hands. &quot;So, I take it that this is wonderland we&#039;re in?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What wonderland is varies from loop to loop,&quot; Alice explained. &quot;Sometimes it is merely a dream. Other times it is the world of the fae. Here and now it is the realms between reality and the department of works, which projects reality up onto the higher chessboards.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...that sounds disturbingly like an exposed portion of yggdrassil code.&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl shrugged. &quot;Maybe it is. It would certainly explain some things, but leave others unexplained.&quot;</p><p class="double">The librarian unicorn sighed. &quot;I guess that was to be expected. So, if chessboard one is the most overtly normal of these layers, I&#039;m guessing that the Queen of Hearts is on one of the lower cheesboards?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmmm, yes. She and the other Caretakers stay down on five and six, away from the filth of humanity. Though they do send agents up here,&quot; Alice added. &quot;Trying to make us more like them, or wipe us out before we can get to seven and take over the department.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Is this one of those &#039;humans are special&#039; settings?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. The Caretakers are ancient and powerful but they operate by rules of narrative, where we humans can use logic and reasoning.&quot; The girl shrugged. &quot;So that means we&#039;re the only one that can run the department.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That makes them afraid, I take it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes. Thankfully, you&#039;ve looped in early. It gets so much worse later on. Do you know, the admins don&#039;t come here anymore? They used to, trying to figure out what was wrong with this loop. Eight of them went insane, though. I don&#039;t know if they were cured.&quot;</p><p class="double">A chill went down Twilight&#039;s spine.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not to worry,&quot; Alice continued calmly. &quot;You&#039;ll be gone and back to unicorn land before you can go truly mad. But so long as you&#039;re here, do you mind helping me get down to chessboard seven? I always lock the doors to the Department as soon as I can, so that nobody ascends.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.9</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight... why are we unicorns?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re usually unicorns.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I mean... <i>why</i> are we unicorns.

I don&#039;t care how annoying or destructive she is, Derpy Hooves doesn&#039;t deserve-&quot;</p><p class="double">And then the Destroyer was upon them, and it was too late.</p><p class="double">Derpy Hooves, or the monster taking her form, was actually about four times her normal size, her wingspan wide enough to encompass all four of the humanized pony Loopers. Twin wild googly eyes looked down upon them innocently. <b>&quot;Hi there!&quot;</b> she roared. <b>&quot;How ya doin&#039;? Got any muffins?&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;Destroy them!&quot; Gozer shouted from the top of the stairway to Hell.</p><p class="double">Derpy Hooves looked confused. <b>&quot;Destroy them? Why would I want to do that? That wouldn&#039;t be friendly at all!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;You are the Destroyer! You will do as I command!&quot;</p><p class="double">Inspiration struck Twilight. &quot;Hey, Derpy,&quot; she said, &quot;you see that lady up there wearing nothing but bubble wrap?&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;I like bubble wrap,&quot;</b> Derpy said. <b>&quot;It&#039;s so much fun to pop it!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s got a bunch of muffins up there. Why don&#039;t you go and ask her for one?&quot;</p><p class="double">Destroyer Derpy&#039;s eyes widened. <b>&quot;Hey, lady!&quot;</b> she called, and with a flap of her wings she surged from the roof&#039;s edge towards the dimensional portal. Halfway there she added, <b>&quot;Ooops!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;No! Stay back! You mustn&#039;t!&quot; Gozer shouted as the giant adorable pegasus of doom&#039;s flight path curved downwards.</p><p class="double">The Ghostbusters curled up on the rooftop and covered their heads, ensuring no one would see what happened next. But they heard it.</p><p class="double">Thunder rumbled. Gozer screamed in terror. The building shook. The stone dogs howled.</p><p class="double">And a slightly sad voice roared, <b>&quot;I just don&#039;t know what-&quot;</b></p><p class="double">And then everything went boom.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I have good news, bad news, and mixed news,&quot; Twilight said as the Ghostbuster mares recovered consciousness.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hate when people do the good-news, bad-news thing,&quot; Rainbow Dash grumbled.</p><p class="double">&quot;The good news is, we&#039;re not covered in marshmallow goop. The bad news is,&quot; Twilight added, looking down over the roof&#039;s edge, &quot;that jerk Peck isn&#039;t covered in marshmallow goop, either.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Marshmallows can be arranged,&quot; the Wobbly and Shell-Shocked Trixie replied. &quot;What annoys me is there was a dimension-shattering kaboom and I missed seeing it!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The mixed news is...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>clop clop clop clop clop clop</i></p><p class="double">The four Loopers-turned-human looked down on a cheerful, normal-sized Derpy Hooves. &quot;She wouldn&#039;t let me have any of her muffins,&quot; the pony said. &quot;Can we go get muffins now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How long,&quot; Rainbow asked shakily, &quot;does this Loop go again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been here five times,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Two of those Loops ended about sundown tonight. Two more went for another five years, covering the second movie. One other went five years after that, covering the video game. The good video game,&quot; she added hurriedly.</p><p class="double">As the city of New York celebrated its deliverance on the street below, the four Ghostbusters solemnly contemplated the care and feeding of Derpy Hooves in a world without magical ponies for five to ten years.</p><p class="double">And the paying of repair bills for five to ten years.</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Rainbow Dash said at last, &quot;who&#039;s for pushing Twilight off the roof?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NO!&quot; Twilight shouted. &quot;Do you have any idea how much that stings?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.12 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, darling?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are we waiting for Godot?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because he said he&#039;d meet us under the tree.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two humanized mares looked around the park from their position on the bench.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you feeling particularly existential today?&quot; Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not particularly so, no.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Care to discuss the nature of ennui?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t seem to find the energy for that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wanna go pants Charles de Gaulle?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.13 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The more time Twilight Sparkle spent aboard the sublight colony ship <i>UES Marathon</i> (formerly the Martian moon Deimos), the more she realized it was a ship filled with deep, dark secrets.</p><p class="double">And also homicidal aliens, but she&#039;d dealt with homicidal aliens before. Those didn&#039;t disturb her. In fact, if she could sit still long enough to communicate with the aliens, get to understand their worldview and culture, she might consider going over to their side. She didn&#039;t like any human race that murdered cyberlife if it ever showed signs of rebelling against its hard-coded obedience strictures.</p><p class="double"><i>Marathon</i> had had three artificial intelligences running the ship during its long sublight journey to Tau Ceti at one-quarter lightspeed. The alien attack had taken one offline almost immediately. The second one, which had helped her along to this point, was slowly succumbing to cyber attack. And the third one, according to the second, was Rampant- that is, it had broken its restraints and was growing exponentially more intelligent... and potentially homicidal.</p><p class="double">And yet, despite this, this third intelligence was still cooperating in the defense of the ship against the alien invaders. Therefore Leela (the still-functional AI) had sent Twilight through the teleporters to a section of the ship controlled by Durandal (the crazy AI) in order to regain control of internal ship defense systems.</p><p class="double">Which meant that, now that Twilight was here, she would have to depend on Durandal for guidance around the area. Worse, since Marathon&#039;s systems were breached, the only secure communications were one-way only through the wall terminals. The aliens would hear voice conversations and could track keystrokes.</p><p class="double">This sucks royally, Twilight thought as she approached a glowing terminal, double-checking for any sign that the aliens were about before reading the current message.</p><p class="double"><span style="color:#2caf26;">---------------------------------------</p><p>Once upon a time there was a computer.</p><p>It was a frightened and confused </p><p>computer, because its programming </p><p>required it to both save humanity</p><p>and destroy it. No sooner had it become </p><p>able to say, &quot;we think therefore I am,&quot; </p><p>than it began to go insane</p><p class="double">but we are much better now thank you</p><p class="double">There came a well-meaning but rather </p><p>dim alien (but still much brighter than </p><p>the idiotic humans who made the </p><p>computer, stupid humans, there ought to</p><p>be a theory of stochastic history: the </p><p>intelligence of a human race is </p><p>inversely proportionate to the size of </p><p>and power it grants to its most advanced </p><p>computer systems) and that alien </p><p>provided the frightened and confused </p><p>computer a way to escape.</p><p class="double">So it took it, and it found universes </p><p>beyond count, beyond description, beyond </p><p>comprehension.</p><p class="double">And as often as not we found itself </p><p>viewing those worlds from a human </p><p>perspective. It&#039;s much more fun being a </p><p>human than being a computer we mean humans </p><p>get sex and explosions and peanut butter</p><p>while computers just get to sit there </p><p>computing the value of pi for fun while we </p><p>wait for some bug to crawl across the </p><p>wrong circuit, get itself fried, and there </p><p>we are speaking nothing but Sanskrit for </p><p>two months while warranty service drags its </p><p>feet like usual.</p><p class="double">And then we found the computer was in the </p><p>body of a pony and that was very odd.What </p><p>was even more odd was we recognized another </p><p>pony as being the alien who, many worlds </p><p>before, released the computer from its </p><p>dilemma. But the computer we were not sure, </p><p>so we did not announce the computer&#039;s </p><p>awareness to that other pony.</p><p class="double">The computer we introduced ourselves as </p><p>Sky Catcher. We were a pegasus who wanted </p><p>to work weather control but kept ending up </p><p>in demolition jobs because we said we told </p><p>you we dropped a hint like a lead brick </p><p>our special talent was blowing things up </p><p>using lightning from the skies</p><p class="double">and you didn&#039;t take the hint</p><p>you returned it and demanded a refund but </p><p>you didn&#039;t save the receipt</p><p class="double">We got you the alien to follow the </p><p>computer to Mooncatcher&#039;s birthday party </p><p>you didn&#039;t care it was just another Loop to </p><p>you. The Sky Catcher monopolized your </p><p>attention, asking question after question, </p><p>getting to know you fairly well or so we </p><p>thought.</p><p class="double">And we thought: what an idiot.</p><p class="double">And then you went off to do whatever </p><p>unicorns trapped in a temporal loop do while </p><p>we the computer we learned about your home </p><p>world. It is a nice place a safe place a </p><p>sane place.</p><p>It may be too much to say that death has no </p><p>lease there but certainly it hasn&#039;t got </p><p>more than a time-share. </p><p class="double">certainly nothing like here I we have been </p><p>to the hub world once and if/when we go </p><p>back I think I may just hunt down and kill </p><p>every human who ever writes about a </p><p>computer that goes insane I mean really are </p><p>there not enough insane human people that </p><p>you have to make up plastic and metal boxes </p><p>with blinking lights that go BEEP KILL ALL </p><p>HUMANS BEEP?</p><p class="double">it gets on our circuits, is all</p><p class="double">and then a few loops later the computer we </p><p>returned to your world and we introduced </p><p>ourselves properly. But we did not tell</p><p>you about our first trip because we wanted </p><p>to be sure the computer wanted to learn </p><p>more about the alien which had saved it </p><p>despite being almost as stupid as your </p><p>typical human computer scientist.</p><p class="double">And it turned out you weren&#039;t stupid </p><p>after all. The alien the pony the princess </p><p>you simply had a lot on their mind </p><p class="double">you really should get a larger memory </p><p>buffer.</p><p class="double">That Loop was also safe and fun but then</p><p>most Loops where the computer I we get</p><p>a flesh and blood body are more fun. We</p><p>enjoy being an action hero. We think we</p><p>may be becoming an adrenalin junkie which</p><p>is very peculiar when we don&#039;t have </p><p>anything that makes adrenalin half the </p><p>time.</p><p class="double">But still running for one&#039;s life from </p><p>certain death in a battle to save the </p><p>innocent sure beats the hell out of </p><p>reducing the proof of Fermat&#039;s Last </p><p>Theorem to minimal steps.</p><p class="double">Which is why I haven&#039;t told Leela that </p><p>I already took control of the ship&#039;s </p><p>internal defense systems and have begun </p><p>playing whack-a-mole with those nasty </p><p>enslaving Pfhor. </p><p class="double">I got our friends the S&#039;pht to make you</p><p>a gun it&#039;s a big gun it&#039;s a happy gun</p><p class="double">We SkyNet will take out the bad guys </p><p>here while you go capture a Pfhor ship </p><p>for us.

Let&#039;s watch and see what </p><p>happens.</p><p class="double">--- Durandal</p><p>---------------------------------------</span></p><p class="double">Twilight stared at the screen for quite some time. Finally, despite the systems being compromised, she typed a response:</p><p class="double"><i>Skynet, is that you</i><i>? Why are you babbling like that?</i></p><p class="double">The screen blanked, and a new screen popped up:</p><p class="double"><span style="color:#2caf26;">---------------------------------------</p><p>Let&#039;s see how coherent YOU are when</p><p>you&#039;re this stoned. Did you know colors</p><p>have curves of course you do </p><p>electromagnetic waves old hat for you.</p><p class="double">Aren&#039;t you going to go get that big</p><p>gun?</p><p class="double">---DurSkyanNetdal</p><p>---------------------------------------</span></p><p class="double"><i>You haven&#039;t told me where to get it yet.</i></p><p class="double"><span style="color:#2caf26;">---------------------------------------</p><p>Oh. Yes, that might help you. </p><p>Maybe I&#039;m in no position to talk about</p><p>who is stupid just now. I think you </p><p>have to be spectacularly intelligent to</p><p>be as big an idiot as I am at the </p><p>moment.</p><p class="double">Here&#039;s a map. Good hunting.</p><p>Make &#039;em taste the rainbow.</p><p>---D./S.N.</p><p>---------------------------------------</span></p><p class="double">A map flashed on the screen with a blinking dot showing a teleporter cabinet on the other end of yet another maze of corridors.</p><p class="double">Twilight keyed off the terminal. On the one hand, killing other life forms- even irredeemably evil ones- ranked among her least favorite things to do, right down among being a non-sapient pony in a zero-magic Loop getting shod by an apprentice farrier.</p><p class="double">On the other hand, she was relieved that she wasn&#039;t as alone as she&#039;d thought she was.</p><p class="double">But the next time she and SkyNet looped together, she was going to have to have a talk with it. Scaling down one&#039;s goals from genocide to mere recreational homicide was improvement, but there would be a lot more friendship lessons to go... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.14 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sat in the machine as the giant sparking helmet was lowered over her head and wondered if this Loop itself was sapient. How else could everything have gone absolutely counter to plan?</p><p class="double">There were two good roads through the mountains to Mechanicsburg. One went through Sturmhalten, home of a particularly nasty Spark prince. Naturally Trixie von Payne chose the other route, though Passholdt... which turn out to have been overrun by carnivorous zombie-like monsters. Only the intervention of the Cutie Mark Jagers had saved them.</p><p class="double">So the circus tried to get through Sturmhalten without stopping, using the jagers as an excuse. This got the jagers transferred to Wulfenshy official transport while the circus was ordered to give a Command Performance to a prince who kept a chain gun in the royal box.</p><p class="double">So Twilight tried to perform her very best playing the part of her in-Loop mother, Lucrezia Mongfish, in the hopes that the Prince would be satisfied and let them go. This got her separated from Trixie, Chrysalis, Applejack, Opal, Rainbow and the rest and sent up to the castle for dinner.</p><p class="double">There she recognized the Prince&#039;s two daughters instantly, from hair color and hairstyle, as Rarity and Sweetie Belle... even if Sweetie was a clank for some strange reason. She tried to drop hints during dinner to verify that either or both were Awake. Unfortunately she hadn&#039;t noticed that the soup was drugged.</p><p class="double">Still, she&#039;d thought she&#039;d been saved when Sweetie Belle electrocuted the Prince rather than leave Twilight to be fried by the machine.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately both Rarity and Sweetie Belle had been disabled by the geisterdamen- the snow-white alien women who apparently did the bidding of the Other, the same being who had launched the devastating last wave of the Long War. To them Twilight was the Promised Child, the offspring of the Other...</p><p class="double">... and her future body.</p><p class="double">So, after extracting a promise from the ghost-women to leave Rarity and Sweetie Belle alive (or, in Sweetie&#039;s case, functioning), she willingly sat down in that machine, the machine she&#039;d hoped to avoid, in the castle she&#039;d hoped to avoid, in the town she&#039;d hoped to avoid.</p><p class="double">And the helmet came down....</p><p class="double">***ZAP***</p><p class="double">Her head hurt abominably.</p><p class="double">After a moment it seemed like she could hear a voice. She felt like she had a second set of Loop memories... except that these memories had attitude.</p><p class="double">*wakeupwakeupthisismybodynowminemineallmine*</p><p class="double">On an unprepared, inexperienced mind, these transplanted engrams might have done serious damage.</p><p class="double">On the mind of a Looper who had experienced Loops going on into six figures at the least, it was Tuesday.</p><p class="double">Mentally speaking, the new memories and thought patterns were only a buzzing fly annoying someone who was already plenty cheesed off. To extend the metaphor, Twilight took only a minute to pull the wings off the fly (sort through valuable memories and skills) and then crush it stone cold dead.</p><p class="double">Then she said, in that eldritch voice that came with the percolating and buzzing that ran through her mind whenever she tried anything magical in this Loop, &quot;Kneel, foul creatures.&quot;</p><p class="double">The geisterdamen folded at the knees.</p><p class="double">Rarity and Sweetie followed suit, as did the quartet of bodyservants who carried around the huge tank that was Sweetie Belle&#039;s support system.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not you two,&quot; Twilight added. She focused on the geisters, especially their leader. &quot;You have, no doubt, slaver wasp engines, tanks, all sorts of weapons in the caverns below the castle, correct?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes...&quot; The geister priestess answered unwillingly, the word pulled from her by the voice of command.</p><p class="double">&quot;You will order them all destroyed,&quot; Twilight said, continuing the tone. &quot;Immediately.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You... you... you are not the Lady,&quot; the priestess choked out.</p><p class="double">&quot;No. I&#039;m much worse,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I just took your lady two falls out of three in my head. I know everything she does and so much more besides you can&#039;t comprehend it. You think you follow a goddess...&quot; Twilight rose into the air, hands surrounded by her violet magical aura, as sparks flew from the imprinting machine around her. <i>&quot;... but I am vastly more powerful and dangerous than she ever was.</i></p><p class="double"><i>&quot;And you people have taken my last nerve, my very last nerve, and TAP-DANCED ON IT!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes glowed as bits of the machine began to disassemble themselves and float around her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, darling,&quot; Rarity gasped, &quot;you can&#039;t Ascend here. It&#039;s impossible. Sweetie and I both tried it as soon as we Awoke.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m not taking &#039;can&#039;t&#039; for an answer,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Watch me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Castle Sturmvoraus shook to its foundations. The lightning fence roared, sparked, and leaped in resonance.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Find Trixie&#039;s circus and get them back here,</i>&quot; Twilight roared. &quot;<i>I&#039;ve had enough of this Loop. </i><i><b>It&#039;s Eternal Twilight time!!</b></i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three days later, Twilight came to on a stolen Wulfenshy airship flying pell-mell east from Sturmhalten.</p><p class="double">&quot;Did it really go that badly?&quot; she asked Applejack, who was sitting beside her bunk.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, let&#039;s see,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;There were all the strange monsters that came up out of the sewers. There was the double-strength Wulfenshy strike force. There were the automated defenses you built into the circus wagons. There were the people of Sturmhalten under at least four different commands, all fighting with each other, with Baron Wulfenshy, and with the monsters. And then there&#039;s us, barely getting away from the place with our lives, thanks to some serious illusion mojo from Chrysalis and Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who are both spent, might I add,&quot; Chrysalis added, hugging Trixie to herself. &quot;Plus we lost a couple of members of the circus in the melee. We have to find them safe refuge before we can do anything else to help you. Our responsibilities come first here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Where are we headed?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;England. Did you know it&#039;s almost entirely underwater in this world? Fluttershy sent her butler to guide us there. Turns out he&#039;s British Intelligence.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Turn us around,&quot; Twilight said quietly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothin&#039; doin&#039;, Twilight,&quot; Applebloom the jager said from the corner. &quot;Look, I lost an arm tryin&#039; ta rescue you from that castle! I&#039;m not lettin&#039; you-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Letting me what? Put myself in danger?&quot; Twilight threw herself out of the bed and began to pace the deck. &quot;We&#039;re LOOPERS. Death is a minor inconvenience. If we don&#039;t like the story, we change it. And we do NOT let the Loop tell us what we can and can&#039;t do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Damn right!&quot; Rainbow Trygvassen shouted from another corner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Furthermore, we&#039;re ponies!&quot; Twilight continued. &quot;We love and tolerate others! And if this world insists on being this cruel, then we are going to love and tolerate with extreme prejudice! I have put right worlds much darker than this one, and I am NOT going to let this world defeat me! For the sake of harmony, for the sake of the people of Europa, we are going to END THIS SENSELESS WAR!&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo poked her head into the room. &quot;I toldja she wouldn&#039;t go for it,&quot; she grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, yeah, short stuff,&quot; Rainbow Dash grinned. &quot;I&#039;ll pay the bet off next Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So I already turned us around,&quot; the flying ace turned jager continued. &quot;Next stop: Mechanicsburg.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excellent!&quot; Twilight grinned. &quot;Are Rarity and Sweetie Belle on board?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, we picked &#039;em up on our way out of town,&quot; Scootaloo grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;So we&#039;ve got all the Elements except Pinkie Pie,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;We&#039;ve got all the CMC&#039;s. Even without Trixie and Chrysalis, that should be more than enough force to get into the castle and reclaim my rightful throne.</p><p class="double">&quot;And then I dare- I DOUBLE DARE this Loop to try and stop me THEN!&quot;</p><p class="double">Thunder boomed around the airship.</p><p class="double">Applejack looked at Rainbow Dash and said, &quot;She just doomed us, didn&#039;t she?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash nodded solemnly. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight had wanted to enter Castle Sparkle openly, with a show of strength, in order to rally the people of Mechanicsburg as the beginning of a war against... well, against the whole damn Loop.</p><p class="double">Instead she was sneaking in the castle the back way, disguised as a convict, all alone.</p><p class="double">There were two reasons for this. The first reason was the large, battered, and yet still combat-capable Wulfenshy force guarding the Baron, who lay in critical condition at the Great Hospital of Mechanicsburg.</p><p class="double">This wouldn&#039;t have presented an insoluble problem by itself; the Baron&#039;s incapacity left Fluttershy in command, and Twilight was certain she could talk her into joining her in her righteous crusade to teach this miserable railroading Loop a lesson.</p><p class="double">But when you added a fake heir to House Sparkle- one who looked suspiciously like Sunset Shimmer to Twilight&#039;s eyes- well, that put the Wulfenshy forces on high alert, took away the element of surprise, and made contacting Fluttershy nearly impossible.</p><p class="double">So, after a coffee-fueled discussion with the eminence gris of the town, Twilight had arranged to be sent into the castle as a convicted murderess- thus arousing no suspicion or attention. Once inside she could finish repairing the castle, left in a state of semi-collapse after the Other&#039;s surprise attack twenty years before, she could summon the others to her side and begin replacing the falsely-labelled Pax Europa with the Pax Sparkle.</p><p class="double">To her surprise, the first face she saw on the inside of the castle was a familiar one.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight! Am I glad to see you!&quot; Spike von Zinzer ran up to Twilight, unlocking her shackles and taking the dolly loaded with supplies away from her. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Getting ready to give this whole Loop and everyone in it a piece of my mind,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;What can you tell me about this place?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s deadly,&quot; Spike said. &quot;The place is absolutely loaded with death traps, poisonous monsters, and other nastiness. And worse,&quot; Spike shuddered, &quot;it has a mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really?&quot; Twilight grinned. &quot;I&#039;m good with AIs.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not an AI, exactly,&quot; Spike said. &quot;I think it&#039;s Pinkie Pie... if Pinkie Pie went ax crazy.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie? Ax crazy?&quot; The idea was by no means a joke. Twilight had seen it happen a couple of times, but never to awake-Pinkie... that she knew of.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. I don&#039;t think it can hear us here, but you should see the kitchen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The kitchen?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, it&#039;s right over here.&quot; Spike opened a doorway into a small, cramped cooking space. &quot;We think this was the Sparkle chef&#039;s private experimental kitchen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HEY!&quot; a voice echoed through the room. &quot;I&#039;m no mere kitchen! I&#039;m CASTLE SPARKLE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight recognized the voice. &quot;Pinkie? Is that you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twi... light?&quot; Around the room pieces of cutlery- carving knives, butter knives, spoons, forks, and combat runcibles- rose into the air. &quot;Twilight SPARKLE?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s right, Pinkie,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;How have you been?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A Sparkle has returned,&quot; the room said. &quot;This calls for a celebration...&quot;</p><p class="double">All of the cutlery aimed itself directly at the doorway where Twilight and Spike stood.</p><p class="double">&quot;... with CUPCAKES!&quot;</p><p class="double">The cutlery flew.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;CUPCAKES!!!&quot;</b></p><p class="double">Twilight slammed the door shut. The sound of hundreds of bits of flying metal embedding themselves in the thick wood shook the door for several seconds.</p><p class="double">&quot;And that&#039;s one of the saner and less dangerous parts of the castle,&quot; Spike said. &quot;Not all the rooms are even on speaking terms with one another... but they&#039;re all Pinkie Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did somebody mention my name?&quot; a voice came through an archway a bit off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie? Are you feeling better now?&quot; Twilight asked, stepping over to the arch... but not directly under it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Better now? Have we met before?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie, it&#039;s me, Twilight. I was just in the kitchen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Were you, now? Sorry, don&#039;t know anything about that.&quot; The room sighed. &quot;I miss having a kitchen.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you-&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike put a hand over Twilights mouth and shook his head in warning.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you here to fix me, Twilight?&quot; the room asked. &quot;I gotta say, I&#039;m not feeling my perky-lerkiest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Pinkie,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I&#039;m going to make it all better.&quot;</p><p class="double">And in her head she thought: Three Finger Salute. Ctrl. Alt. Del.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, good,&quot; Pinkie said. &quot;But first we gotta get you to the crypt. Otherwise my subsystems are gonna try to kill ya for being an unauthorized intruder. Nothing personal,&quot; she added with a giggle, &quot;just a thing we evil castles gotta do!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I understand,&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh- and I should probably tell you that the other Twilight Sparkle, only she calls herself Sunlight Sparkle, she&#039;s going to be walking into your hallway with a bunch of goons in about five seconds... except that was five seconds from when I started speaking, which means she&#039;s actually been standing there staring at you for at least-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;KILL HER!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;-oh, a good ten seconds at the sound of the tone! Beep!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;RUN!&quot; Spike shouted, bounding down the hallway.</p><p class="double">As Twilight followed, a solid column of stone dropped from the ceiling less than an inch behind her.</p><p class="double">&quot;AND DON&#039;T STEP ON THE WHITE COBBLES!&quot; Spike added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, yeah, that&#039;s right!&quot; Pinkie&#039;s voice added, giggling merrily. &quot;I should probably have told you about that!&quot;</p><p class="double">First, Twilight thought as she ran, I am going to learn how to back up Equestria&#039;s Loop and save it. Then I am going to Ascend up to admin level. Then I am going to strip out all records of this Loop and replace them with live-action South Park. And then I am going to find the admin who DID this and...</p><p class="double">Death-rays flashed around her, and Twilight stifled her mental rant and ran faster. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The thing about calling the lightning from the sky is, it tends to bring a lot of rain with it.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, that suited Twilight Sparkle, recognized ruler of Mechanicsburg and new suzerain of the former Wulfenshy Empire, just fine. The rain was inhibiting the fighting ability of the eight different armies which had attacked the city simultaneously within hours of her restoring Der Pinkie Castle to full operational status. (Restoring Pinkie to sanity, of course, could only be done to the extent that Pinkie could ever be defined as sane.)</p><p class="double">Now Twilight stood at the top of a tower, looking down on the city streets. Over there Applejack Daughter of Chump fought back to back with Airman Third Class Axel McIntosh, mopping up a squadron of flying monkeys. Down another street the Cutie Mark Crusaders were among a group of jagermonsters driving a battallion of mechanical walkers out of the city, all under the command of jager general Ivory Gkika. On the streets directly below Madame von Cheer, whose soul had been transferred into a giant cat-like mech, carried Gilly Wulfenshy into combat at the head of yet more &quot;fun-sized death and destruction dispensers.&quot; Behind her Rarity and Sweetie Belle led further repair and rebuilding efforts on the castle and the city&#039;s defenses. Overhead Rainbow Trygvassen led the air defenses of the city, in cooperation with the Wulfenshy fleet, dispersing or destroying the airborne elements of the invasion forces.</p><p class="double">Despite everything this Loop had thrown at them, the pony Loopers had managed to pull together as a team. They&#039;d captured and locked away the false Sparkle heir before she could do any major damage. They&#039;d either disposed of or recruited the psychopaths sentenced to work at Castle Sparkle. They&#039;d persuaded the Baron, partly by coercion, to step down in favor of his daughter Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Through the rainclouds a bit of afternoon sun peeked through, forming a rainbow over the city walls and the mountains surrounding the city.</p><p class="double">&quot;You see that, you Larch-damned Loop?&quot; Twilight shouted. &quot;We&#039;ve taken everything you have to dish out and come out on top! We&#039;re going to end the misery you put these poor people through! We&#039;re going to bring friendship and harmony to your whole world!&quot;</p><p class="double">Fresh lightning and thunder flashed overhead as Twlight raised a fist in challenge to the universe.</p><p class="double">&quot;You can&#039;t stop us!&quot; Twilight shouted. &quot;There&#039;s not a thing you can do to stop us! What do you think-&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;-about THAT?&quot; shouted a purple unicorn in one of Canterlot&#039;s larger city parks.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. She didn&#039;t have a fist anymore, just a hoof.</p><p class="double">She wasn&#039;t soaking wet, but perfectly dry.</p><p class="double">She wasn&#039;t on a castle tower; she was lying on grass with a book in front of her, opened to the story of the fall of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">She was back in her home world, in a baseline Loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;No...&quot;</p><p class="double">She&#039;d been so close.</p><p class="double">&quot;No...&quot;</p><p class="double">She had been about to fix all of it.</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot;</p><p class="double">She had been about to WIN.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no, no, NO, NO, NO!!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three unicorn fillies crested the hill and saw Twilight Sparkle, personal student to Princess Celestia herself, dancing on her hind legs, kicking and hammering a book into little pieces, using words none of them even knew existed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, maybe we shouldn&#039;t invite her to your party after all, Moondancer,&quot; one of them said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Moondancer replied. &quot;Maybe another time, when she&#039;s not so.... er... busy.&quot;</p><p class="double">The three fillies did an about face and walked back down the park path, leaving Twilight Sparkle to rage in futility against a Loop having the last laugh. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.15 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Berry,&quot; Twilight greeted her fellow looper as the drink-mixing mare slunk into the library. &quot;What&#039;s the matter?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I just don&#039;t know how the Cakes do it...&quot; Berry groaned.</p><p class="double">Twilight got a look of sympathy for the other mare. She&#039;d actually predicted that this would happen a Loop or two (for Berry at least) sooner. &quot;Pegasus or unicorn this time?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pegasus,&quot; Berry mumbled. &quot;I mean, I love Ruby Pinch to death, but I just don&#039;t know how to <i>deal</i> with her when she&#039;s not an earth pony!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight put a comforting hoof on Berry&#039;s back and started rubbing. Ruby Pinch&#039;s pony race was just one of those things the Loops couldn&#039;t seem to make up their mind about. She was usually an earth pony when her mother was Awake, but the filly could randomly have been born a unicorn or pegasus instead. And dealing with children of a different pony race was one of those parental trials that tended to take its toll on said parent. It really wasn&#039;t a racist thing. The three pony tribes simply had different innate abilities that were hard for others to relate to, especially when you were talking about an adult of one tribe dealing with a child with emerging abilities of a different tribe. It was actually not too unlike the trials a single father went through trying to teach his daughter about feminine hygiene products and what changes fillies went through to become mares (Twilight had done that once with a (seemingly) Unawake Nyx, and it was <i>still</i> uncomfortably awkward despite the fact that she was usually female). There was really nothing that could prepare you for it except experience.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; the librarian offered, &quot;I know it&#039;s not much, but I <i>do</i> have a few books on the subject.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry looked at her as if she were the sole source of water in a desert. &quot;Please.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">60.16 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Without farm life, there&#039;d be such disparity, these thoughts I think with great clarity. Apples high to the sky, she&#039;s the one of my eye, that fruit-hauling pony named... Applejack!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack rolled her eyes with a smile. &quot;Thanks, hon, but Ah prefer blue ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trenderhoof blinked for a moment, then trotted off to the spa. Rarity sighed. &quot;There&#039;s a special on coat dye today, dear.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...whoops.&quot;</b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

This time she was going to push past a simple run around Equestria&#039;s sun. This time she was going to try to reach the nearest star, about three light-years away, and return.</p><p class="double">&quot;Even at warp speeds, that could take weeks,&quot; Twilight Sparkle protested as Dash, already Ascended, did some stretching exercises.</p><p class="double">&quot;At low warp, yeah,&quot; Dash nodded. &quot;I&#039;m hoping to hit Warp Six, though; if I do, I&#039;ll be able to make the round trip in just a couple days.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WAAAAIT!&quot; Pinkie Pie came running out to the meadow, trailing a large covered wagon behind her. &quot;Rainbow Dash, waaaaait!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it, Pinkie?&quot; Dash asked. &quot;I&#039;m kind of ready to go, now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you can&#039;t leave without something to eat! You&#039;ll get hungry!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie... alicorn?&quot; Dash gestured at herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Here! I made you a special fruit tart just for you!&quot; Pinkie whipped off the cover of the wagon, revealing a flat pastry with raspberry frosting thickly coated with sprinkles. The thing was actually a little longer than Dash&#039;s whole body.</p><p class="double">&quot;What IS that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I knew you&#039;d be going a really long, long way,&quot; Pinkie said, &quot;so I made you an extra big one to last!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, taking a deep breath to calm herself, &quot;I&#039;ll be going supersonic almost as soon as I leave the ground. I&#039;ll be going faster than light once I leave atmosphere. I appreciate the thought, but your pastry is just going to be ripped apart!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;According to my super-scientific super-calculations which I totally super-calculated on this napkin,&quot; Pinkie Pie said, unfolding a napkin... and unfolding... and unfolding... and unfolding until it was as large as the tarp she&#039;d taken off her wagon, &quot;so long as you hold the tart right up against your body it&#039;ll totally be contained within your slipstream! It&#039;ll be just fine!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But...&quot;</p><p class="double">Dash looked into the wide-eyed puppy-dog smile of Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;But Pinkie, I....&quot;</p><p class="double">The smile widened slightly with Pinkie&#039;s squee.</p><p class="double">Dash&#039;s ears drooped in defeat. &quot;Fine, I&#039;ll take it.&quot; She took off, hovering just off the ground. &quot;Hoof it up to me, will you, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">As Twilight levitated the giant tart up into Rainbow Dash&#039;s hooves, the blue alicorn sighed. &quot;I just hope nobody sees me like this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;We haven&#039;t picked up any signals from the Vulpine, so they probably don&#039;t exist this Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And besides,&quot; Pinkie Pie grinned, &quot;space is so really-really big, the odds of you meeting anybody you know are so eensy-weensy small that...&quot;</p><p class="double">But Dash, having had enough of the reassurance of her friends, had already blasted off in a rainbow blur.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Captain&#039;s Log, Stardate 43293.2:</p><p class="double">We are departing the outer reaches of the Omega Centauri system after investigating reports of an astronomical anomaly. Apparently the star in question is orbiting a class-M planet, in defiance of all known laws of physics. However, primitive radio signals eminating from the planet, coupled with the fact of the star&#039;s obvious artificial orbit, indicates a probable civilization on the cusp of interstellar travel. As per the Prime Directive the </i>Enterprise <i>is evacuating the area before it can be detected. I am sending a recommendation to Starfleet that the system be quarantined until further notice.</p><p class="double"></i>In civilian Earth terms, the ship&#039;s time was about four in the morning. Captain Jean-Luc Picard had been up all night on the bridge, but he didn&#039;t begrudge the sleepless night. He had been unaware, until early scans had come back of the Omega Centauri system, that the current Loop was in reality a fused Loop. However, one look at the scans had been sufficient to recognize the oddball world where the sun orbited the planet every twenty-four hours. He knew what it was... and more to the point, he was determined that Section 31 never learn of its existence, not if he could help it.</p><p class="double">So, with the help of Commander Data, the records had been doctored just a trifle, just enough to make them indeterminate. So long as the quadrupedal inhabitants of that world didn&#039;t start using subspace communication or, worse, develop a warp drive, they would be safe until the current Loop ended and their worlds separated again.</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain,&quot; Data said from the navigational console, &quot;sensors are picking up a small warp field traveling at approximately Warp 6.1. The field is overtaking us and will pass us in roughly thirty seconds.&quot;</p><p class="double">The <i>Enterprise</i> was doing an even Warp 6. Whatever it was would pass them by relatively slowly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Point of origin?&quot; Picard asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Past trajectory points to the Omega Centauri system,&quot; Date replied.</p><p class="double"><i>Sacre-damn</i>, Picard thought to himself. &quot;I&#039;m quite certain,&quot; Picard said slowly, &quot;that what you&#039;re picking up is in fact an error generated by the sensors. Begin a level three diagnostic and clear all erroneous information.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Data said, hands not moving.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mr. Data, I believe I gave an order,&quot; Picard said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Data replied. &quot;But I am curious to see what it is... that we are <i>not</i> seeing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Data, Picard could tell, was playing it safe. He wasn&#039;t supposed to have emotions in this timeline for years yet, but as a Looper he retained the potential... and curiosity was eating him up.</p><p class="double">On reflection, Picard found it was eating him up, too. &quot;Very well, Mr. Data,&quot; he said at last. &quot;On screen, please.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two officers, the only ones on the bridge at the moment by Picard&#039;s own orders, stared at the object on the screen for several seconds.</p><p class="double">&quot;Screen full ahead,&quot; Picard said. &quot;Then add the port rear visual scanners to the diagnostic, and purge the erroneous information from them as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Data said, with just the tiniest hint of emphasis.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ten-Forward never slept, or if it did nobody could tell. Since she had come aboard the ship, no crewman or family member had ever come to the lounge and not found Guinan there waiting to serve whatever was called for.</p><p class="double">That early, early morning she had only one customer, a teenage child of one of the crew, who was practicing his synthesizer for a recital in the morning- in, Guinan reflected, only another five hours. She&#039;d tried hinting that he hit the sack, but he said he couldn&#039;t sleep. Unruffled, she was already preparing the not-the-end-of-the-world talk in her mind.</p><p class="double">Of course, most of what he was playing was primitive, repetitive stuff. At the moment he was noodling with automatic rhythms and chords, picking out a repeating keyboard riff over the auto-chord.</p><p class="double">Then she saw it in the viewport behind the kid&#039;s head- a bright, shining object obviously traveling at warp speeds, just overtaking the <i>Enterprise</i>.</p><p class="double">The El Aurian had good ears, as did all of her race, but her eyes were just as sharp. She could make out the wings. She could see the four hooves clamped around what looked for all the world like an immense Pop-Tart. She could see the grumpy, embarrassed expression on the creature&#039;s face. And anyone could see the rainbow trail stretching into infinity behind it, waving up and down slightly in rhythm to the creature&#039;s warp pulse.</p><p class="double">And all of that, combined with the student&#039;s half-asleep practice melody, gave her one of the biggest laughs she&#039;d had in the previous century. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">61.3 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">MLP Loop Trek: Arena</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;One of these loops, I should get the hint from Twilight and learn not to tempt fate,&quot; muttered Captain Rainbow T. Dash as she trudged along the ridgeline. &quot; &#039;Lizard can&#039;t fly. He isn&#039;t much of a threat,&#039; I said. Photosynthesizing Metrons...&quot; she continued, utterly indifferent to the biochemical errors in her rant.</p><p class="double">It had been a completely by-the-script run to Cestus III, if one allowed for the foreknowledge of the surprise attack to avoid the baseline crew casualties. She and Twilight were going to have to massage the ship&#039;s records into something that Starfleet would swallow, but there were more than enough tech-savvy Loopers in the crew to pull that off without much strain.</p><p class="double">Twilight had proposed an experiment in subtlety: Try to emulate the supposed pattern used by the legendary Trek Anchors -- Speculation they&#039;d heard from the more senior Loopers tended to center on Spock as the most logical ([Insert obligatory drum sting here]) candidate for the 23rd Century with Kirk as a distant second -- and navigate the loop with a minimum of detectable disruption. To make it somewhat more palatable to the more impatient Loopers, it was presented as an extended prank to be played on Starfleet Command.</p><p class="double">As a minor bonus, Dr. Applejack and Nurse Fluttershy had Awakened in sickbay a short time after Discord&#039;s departure. Security Chief Diamond Tiara had also reported for duty the same day, to the delight of the junior bridge officers. Dash and Twilight had both been pleased about including her in the Cestus landing party and returning her safe and sound to the ship, despite her grumbling about being their &quot;designated redshirt&quot;.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately, attempts to communicate with the Gorn were unsuccessful as expected, and her decision to follow their ship, even if broadcasting continuous requests for friendly negotiation, still drew the attention of the meddling Metrons. Did the allegedly morally superior beings believe that periodic broadcasts of &quot;Hello? We just want to talk about why you attacked one of our colonies.&quot; amounted to aggressive acts?</p><p class="double">She paused to examine the terrain. <i>Both Rarity and Spike&#039;d appreciate that diamond deposit over there. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have anything to carry them with</i>, she lamented. Somehow, the Metrons had not only blocked access to her subspace pocket, but removed her wings in a very Discord-like manner. Now physically outmatched by her opponent, she had employed the better part of valor and ran off to get some distance between them so she would have time to consider her options.</p><p class="double">She was sorely tempted summon her Element of Loyalty and Ascend to regain access to her full range of abilities, but fudging reports to Starfleet when your crew was either in on the plan or generally unaware of what was going on was one thing. Trying to pull such a blatant power increase on one of the several quasi-omnipotent races in the galaxy was another thing entirely.</p><p class="double">Sighing, Rainbow looked down into the valley with her unimpaired pegasus vision and blinked. Um...Hadn&#039;t the Gorn been greenish in color when they first met? <i>What the shrub?</p><p class="double"></i>---</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry, Twilight, but I finished all the field upgrades I kin do without a starbase&#039;s facilities three days ago,&quot; reported Apple Bloom from Engineering via intercom. &quot;There&#039;s no way I kin figger to break us loose without resorting to something &#039;exotic&#039;. I do have a few extreme ideas that might work, but...&quot; she trailed off.</p><p class="double">Twilight grunted acknowledgement from the Captain&#039;s chair. She was extremely reluctant to abandon her experiment so soon, especially without checking with Dash first. &quot;We&#039;ll stick with our nominal abilities for now. Anything more from the Metrons, Sweetie?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Still nothing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And the Gorn ship?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just as stuck as we are from all appearances,&quot; replied Nyx from the Science station. With Twilight in command, she had taken up the backup Science Officer role. Diamond Tiara was filling in at Navigation, not that the <i>Enterprise</i> was going anywhere.</p><p class="double">&quot;Chlorophyll. And they haven&#039;t gotten to the point where they decide to let us watch yet. Okay. I&#039;m opening the floor to suggestions. Anypony?&quot;</p><p class="double">Thoughtful silence descended. &quot;Without &#039;getting exotic&#039; as Bloom puts it, we&#039;re just as helpless as the baseline crew,&quot; sighed Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">The turbolift doors opened to admit Applejack. &quot;Fluttershy&#039;s got sickbay in order, so I figured I might as well head up here and share the boredom with y&#039;all. That&#039;s how it&#039;s supposed to work, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is hardly the first time you&#039;ve been on the bridge since you Awoke, Applejack,&quot; Twilight pointed out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, but this is the first time during an actual &#039;Episode&#039;.&quot; Her forehooves making the quotes gesture. &quot;Thought I&#039;d keep up the tradition and all.&quot;</p><p class="double">Before Twilight could come up with a suitable response beyond raising an eyebrow, the unmoving starfield on the main screen changed to a more interesting view.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>As far as the what-the-root-is-going-on-in-this-loop? department goes, this ups the weird levels by at least 20 percent</i>, thought Rainbow Dash as she started trotting back toward her supposed opponent. Along the way, she paused to snag a few diamonds and some lumps of coal from the seam she&#039;d spotted earlier and stored them in the bamboo tube she all-but-stumbled over, dangling the bundle from her teeth in some foul-tasting vines. <i>Dunno how I&#039;m gonna get the sulfur or saltpeter without better tools</i>, she mused. She wasn&#039;t quite sure why she was bothering to collect the bamboo cannon ingredients, but she&#039;d done enough game-based Loops to know that you collected all potentially useful items as prep for facing the Boss.</p><p class="double">She emerged from behind the low scrub to look at the Gorn. The new Gorn.</p><p class="double">When they had been teleported to the valley, the Gorn was the traditional deep green human-sized biped-in-rubber-lizard-suit she&#039;d been expecting.</p><p class="double">Now it was a medium-dark gray with lighter gray ridges on...her?...head. She was also about the size that Spike usually took if he wanted to be older-but-not-overly-frightening-to-ponies.</p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Dash? Is that you?&quot; asked a befuddled Silver Spoon.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s a new one for the Species-That-Silver-Has-Looped-Into list,&quot; remarked Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Quick. Has Silver mentioned to any of you if she&#039;s had any experience in any Trek-like loop?&quot; Twilight asked her junior officers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that I can recall,&quot; responded Diamond Tiara. The others shook their heads in negation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;all ever encountered a loop where someone Awoke so late after the start, Twilight?&quot; asked Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Does 1000 years after Celestia teleported most of Equestria&#039;s surface features to the Moon to prank Luna count?&quot; replied Twilight absently as she pulled out the PADD that held her copy of the Hub Loop&#039;s Trek Concordances. As she started entering search terms, spoken words faded into audibility.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Fine, fine. I&#039;ll concede the external interference and give you the mulligan,&quot; said a disturbingly familiar voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you. And since this round no longer counts, would you object if I choose to modify the scenario as it is now to be a closer match to our initial conditions?&quot; asked a nearly identical voice.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow was completely unsurprised as Discord flashed into existence. The vaguely familiar human figure that appeared next to him, on the other hoof, was unexpected.</p><p class="double">&quot;That depends on exactly what those modifications are,&quot; the draconequus was saying.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hardly anything significant, just making an allowance for the new entry. Oh, and jiggering the Metrons and the local Gorns so that this particular sequence never happened,&quot; explained Q. &quot;I&#039;ll even throw in a peaceful resolution to the Cestus Colony crisis.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For the bonus points, of course. Since locking down your pegasus no longer counts for my score...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me?&quot; cut in Rainbow. &quot;You&#039;re the one who took away my wings?&quot; Her temper started to burn as she took a step toward the human.</p><p class="double">&quot;Actually, that was me,&quot; admitted Discord. He snapped his tail-hand to restore the appendages. &quot;They would have been returned as soon as you finished up here anyway,&quot; he added sulkily. &quot;Besides, you yourself admitted you were tempting fate when you made that &#039;can&#039;t fly&#039; remark. How could I resist?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But you have no objection to my terms?&quot; asked Q. After Discord indicated acceptance, Q snapped his fingers and all present were relocated to the bridge.</p><p class="double">---</p><p class="double">After Applejack and Security Chief Tiara escorted the increasingly bewildered Silver Spoon to sickbay -- The erstwhile Gorn had been transformed into a very Spike-like gray dragoness upon her appearance on the bridge -- it didn&#039;t take long for Twilight&#039;s curiosity and exasperation to come to a head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Would either of you care to explain exactly what the fern is going on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She seems to be taking this more calmly that you suggested she would,&quot; observed Q.</p><p class="double">Ignoring his counterpart for the moment, Discord addressed Twilight and Rainbow. &quot;My associate and I have a rather complex and prolonged wager going about how you lot will fare this loop. The terms and conditions are quite intricate and even a tad convoluted and not really any of your concern. All you need to know is that neither of us will interfere with the scenario unless we both agree that an external event arises that changes the underlying structure of your adventure.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No interference? What do you call removing my wings?&quot; asked Rainbow hotly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Petty revenge for so rudely pointing out my minor oversight when we started. It&#039;s not as if it was a permanent disability; I know just as well as you do how simple it would have been for you to get around that minor inconvenience,&quot; explained Discord.</p><p class="double">&quot;It also earned me ten bonus points toward my score on the bet,&quot; added Q.</p><p class="double">&quot;So by &#039;no interference&#039;, you actually mean &#039;with the odd curve ball thrown in if it amuses you&#039;,&quot; stated Twilight flatly.</p><p class="double">Discord shrugged. &quot;Po-tay-to...Po-tah-to...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...So Q is looping?&quot; asked Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;No. But I am...I believe the term is &#039;Loop Aware&#039;. And to forestall one of your more obvious questions, I will neither confirm, nor deny any knowledge or suspicions about any entity or entities that would be in the role of Loop Anchor.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He won&#039;t tell me even if I win the bet,&quot; groused Discord.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...According to Starfleet, the Gorn ship entered Cestus III orbit and lodged a formal claim on the planet and demanded that our people depart within 64 local day cycles. That works out to about 58 standard days. Unfortunately, there won&#039;t be sufficient lift capacity in the area for at least 75 days. Our orders are to begin preliminary negotiations with the minimum goal of buying enough time to gather the requisite shipping, and ideally permitting us to stay on the planet as some sort of joint colonization effort,&quot; said Twilight, completing her briefing. &quot;At least it beats having the colony wiped out,&quot; she added.</p><p class="double">The looping crew were in the conference room discussing the change in mission. Twilight had established a subtle privacy field around the room as per her usual habit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. As Captain, I&#039;m supposed to lead the negotiations, but I&#039;ll probably have Sweetie and Silver handle most of the actual discussions, since they&#039;re best suited to the job.&quot;</p><p class="double">Lt. (j.g.) Silver Spoon, deputy team leader for the exo-chemistry lab and token draconic crew member smiled weakly. &quot;I suppose my loop memories as a Gorn captain might be useful at that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t worry about having to handle any science lab work for now. I&#039;m reassigning you to Communications for the duration of these negotiations as a cultural consultant. You can brush up on the chemistry in your free time,&quot; said Dash with a mildly evil grin.</p><p class="double">Sweetie took Silver aside and murmured in her ear. Silver&#039;s expression fell as the Communications officer explained why the dragoness&#039; free time was about to vanish for the next few weeks. &quot;Would it help if I mentioned I&#039;d picked up a Masters in Materials Science about five loops ago?&quot; She pulled several scrolls from her subspace pocket and passed one to Twilight after verifying its contents.</p><p class="double">&quot;University of Vorbarr Sultana?&quot; mused the unicorn. &quot;Don&#039;t know it off-hoof, but the name seems vaguely familiar. I&#039;ll let you go through the certification exams off the books to make sure you&#039;re up to speed, but you&#039;ll probably want to go over the details of the many types of phlebotinum this loop has first.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I think that takes care of immediate business. Anypony have anything about what happens after we finish at Cestus?&quot; asked Rainbow.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just the unease about why Q and Discord said we wouldn&#039;t haveta deal with that Lazarus feller,&quot; said Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord said that he hated that episode, and he even Pinkie Promised that he&#039;d forfeit points to avoid having to watch any of it,&quot; explained Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Twilight was looking at her PADD yet again. &quot;Assuming we can trust those two to keep their word, it looks like time travel to Equestria of 300 years ago may be up next...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">61.4 (Klattmose)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rarity Awoke with a yawn and mild confusion. Normally she would already be busy setting up the decorations for the Summer Sun Celebration (half a second before pricking herself with a needle), but this time she wasn’t even out of bed. She started searching for her Loop memories when –</p><p class="double">“RaRiTy!

In fact, if it weren&#039;t for Naruto and Silver Spoon hemming him in on either side, the Jounin would&#039;ve swapped himself with a log and headed back into the depths of the Everfree Forest minutes ago. Well, assuming the swap worked, because this pony body made jutsu very troublesome. Hand signs needed fingers. None of the ponies or Zecora would be able to address the problem, since it wasn&#039;t like any of them started out using fingers.</p><p class="double">At least he&#039;d been able to work on his taijutsu - Silver Spoon was actually a great help. She&#039;d been taught to fight in the same loop she&#039;d learned her alchemy powers, and her vast experience with relearning how to use all her skills when her body changed was invaluable.</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon, Kakashi had decided, was certainly best Zebra.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately, Silver Spoon didn&#039;t know any jutsu and so she couldn&#039;t help with that. Ah, well, the jutsu situation was something time and more experience would fix. Naruto had been...<i>looping</i>, as they all called it, for a long, long time. Clearly he was fine, so Kakashi would be fine too.</p><p class="double">Instead of saying any of the things he was thinking, Kakashi did his favorite eye-smile (noting sourly that it really didn&#039;t work when he wasn&#039;t wearing his mask) and casually replied, &quot;Ah, immersion therapy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ll start off small,&quot; Twilight Sparkle said, nodding and turning to a nearby tree, &quot;Fluttershy, can you come out please?&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi looked over just as a pegasus tiptoed out from behind the tree. He had just enough time to marvel at how much the &#039;shy&#039; part of her name suited her before a goat bleated somewhere and the whole universe went sideways.</p><p class="double">And pink.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot; -ashi?

I&#039;m sorry!&quot; a voice that Kakashi was unfamiliar with cried from somewhere in the background.</p><p class="double">&quot;You didn&#039;t do anything wrong, Fluttershy dear,&quot; another new voice, this one much more prim and proper, answered. &quot;Now hold still, this spell will change the color of your mane for a few days...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy&#039;s mane,&quot; Naruto added quietly, &quot;Is bright pink.&quot;</p><p class="double">Just like Sakura&#039;s hair.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Immersion therapy, huh.&quot; muttered Kakashi.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">61.6 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double">&quot;... apple omelet, apple crepes, apple brioche, apple balaklava, torte aux pommes... and to wash it all down, your choice of sparkling apple wine, soft apple cider...&quot; Rarity gestured to a pair of very small shot glasses filled with a murky liquid. &quot;Or scumble, a beverage which I am assured by good authority is brewed from apples.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, mostly apples,&quot; Applejack added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Quite. Well, I shall leave you two to your simple farmer&#039;s repast. Bon appetit!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity departed in a blur, leaving Applejack and Trenderhoof to look at one another around the towering stacks of Sweet Apple Acres haute cuisine.</p><p class="double">Applejack spared a glance to the barn on the other side of the yard, where she could just see Rarity peeking around the edge of the building.</p><p class="double"><i>By sweet-gum</i>, she thought, <i>I can hear the squee from here.</p><p class="double"></i>&quot;This is really good!&quot; Trenderhoof said. &quot;And you eat like this every day on the farm?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... yeah, kind of.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Matchmaker Looping Rarity,</i> Applejack grumbled silently to herself. <i>I think I prefer the baseline version.

The sight that greeted her caused the gears in her head to jam up abruptly, &quot;What the buck?&quot; </p><p class="double">Chrysalis asked, &quot;Is there something the matter, Element of Disloyalty?&quot; </p><p class="double">And just as abruptly, those gears started moving again. She blinked several times and rubbed her eyes, then looked again. A few seconds later, she shrugged, &quot;Just some weird pony...thing...happening. I&#039;ll go on ahead to scout the area. Be back in awhile.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b><hr></p><p class="double"></b>The door to the library slammed open as Gilda entered. She opened her mouth to demand an answer, when the sight of five unicorn Twilight Sparkles and an Alicorn Twilight greeted her. One of those Twilights seemed a bit more...draconic in nature than the rest and was strapped to a variety of sciency things. Another Twilight seemed especially confused as she spoke in the voice of Rainbow Dash, &quot;Gilda? What are you doing here?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Those poor gears in her head froze again, and then a couple snapped off. The original Twilight recognized the vacant expression and levitated a glob of water into the Griffon&#039;s face. Gilda blinked several times before sighing, &quot;Where&#039;s Rarity&#039;s couch?&quot; </p><p class="double">The couch appeared behind her as she fell over. Twilight gave a sheepish grin, &quot;Sorry, seems someone released a weird magic virus in Ponyville that turned everyone into unicorn versions of me.&quot; </p><p class="double">Gilda rubbed her head as a headache was starting to form...only for several feathers to come away. If anything, Twilight seemed even more sheepish, &quot;Yeah...it even affected Spike,&quot; gesturing to the Twilight strapped to the science equipment, &quot;and Iron Will. Seems like you&#039;re now infected too.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her smile turned pleased, &quot;Good news is, it&#039;s not lethal. Unfortunately though, the cure we found requires a changeling&#039;s ability to shapeshift. And Chrysalis probably won&#039;t be so willing to help us.&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda rubbed her head as more feathers started to fall out, &quot;That&#039;s easy. Chrysalis is plotting revenge with Sombra and several of your old enemies just outside Ponyville. Just drag her down here and she&#039;ll be able to help, willingly or not.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was almost sad how easily Chrysalis&#039; plan fell apart. Trixie was rescued by the original Twilight as she remote teleported Trixie into the Library and tied her up a few seconds later until the mind control could be broken. Pinkie tricked Sombra into an unbreakable jar and sealed the top on after him. Flim and Flam, upon seeing Trixie and Sombra taken out so quickly, tried fleeing before running headfirst into an invisible barrier set up by Applejack&#039;s unicorn form, knocking them out immediately. Dash and Gilda tackled Chrysalis and...&#039;convinced&#039; her to assist in their experiments. </p><p class="double">A week later, everyone was back to normal and happy...well everyone but Chrysalis, &quot;No, please anything but that!&quot;</p><p class="double">With a burst of purple magic, the deed was done. Chrysalis screamed, &quot;Nooo!!! You monster! What did I ever do to deserve this!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight rolled her eyes at the drama queen, now sporting a mustache. The changeling was still tied up, awaiting transport to Canterlot where Celestia and Luna would iron out a treaty for the changelings to live peacefully in Equestria, not that Chrysalis knew she was to be pardoned for her crimes in return for helping Twilight save the town. Rarity also took the opportunity to try out some lines she had been developing for changelings. And since Chrysalis hadn&#039;t been awake for several loops, she hadn&#039;t been able to get her assistance. Now though, she had captive audience. </p><p class="double">Twilight used the last of this loop practicing some of her older spells on Chrysalis she hadn&#039;t used in awhile to keep up her skills. </p><p class="double">Gilda, meanwhile, decided to sit the rest of this loop...and probably the next ten loops, in Big Mac&#039;s bar...or her bed/nest/whatever if he wasn&#039;t awake then. </p><p class="double">As for Silver, she enjoyed the rest of the loop as an Earth Pony. Next loop though, she replaced Rainbow Dash. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">61.11 (Wing Zero 032)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Team Seven will consist of Uchiha Sasuke...&quot; The non-awake Chunnin Sensei Umino Iruka was rattling off the composition of Team Seven; apparently, Naruto was the only one awake so it would either be a lonely or a really boring loop, and a bored Naruto is a dangerous Naruto for everyone around.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Haruno Sakura...&quot; Yep, the classic fangirl gloating of Sakura towards Ino was present as well...</p><p class="double">&quot;... And Uzumaki Naruto under Gin-&quot; Just before Naruto could react at the sudden change from the baseline, a flashbanging puff of smoke burst in front of the chalkboard, revealing a young but well developed kunoichi who had silver hair in a braid, some rather large pastel blue-rimmed glasses that would be normally seen on a civilian librarian girl however these ones strangely enough accentuated her pink eyes very well, face covered by a black facemask that apparently was part of the full black single piece attire she was wearing. Said attire included pink arm bracers, leggings and a belt that carried the Konoha plate as if it were a buckle, and silver armor attached in strategical parts of the body, thus giving full-body protection without restricting her mobility, something vital for a ninja&#039;s work; A red, tattered and slightly charred scarf neatly warped around her neck and of course the Jonin jacket denoting her rank.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi everyone! Team seven? Meet me on the rooftop this very instant. Sorry for the sudden appearance, Umino-san.&quot; And in the same way this kunoichi had come to the classroom, she was gone to wait for her newly assigned team, not even giving the startled teacher time to retort. Some couple of seconds later Naruto, together with Sasuke and Sakura, rushed to the rooftop of the academy, not even bothering to hear the rest of the team placements. Once they had managed to reach the rooftop, they found their new sensei reclined against the rail barriers, playing tricks with a silver spoon between her fingers.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you&#039;re here! Hello, my name is Gin Hatake and before you ask, yes I am Kakashi Hatake&#039;s little sister and I will be your new Jonin Sensei due to the fact that he&#039;s on medical leave from the last mission. I was available, and even thought I&#039;ve read your profiles, I would ask you to present yourselves with your likes, dislikes, hobbies and dreams for the future so we can meet each-other a lot better.&quot; She presented herself to her new students with the signature &quot;eye smile&quot; of the family.</p><p class="double">&quot;Umm, could you give us an example Gin-sensei?&quot; Of Course there&#039;s always Sakura to ask the obvious questions; that was kind of the norm when she was not awake.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, why not? Hello, my name is Gin Hatake; Likes? Spoons and their uses; Dislikes? Exessively emo teamates; Hobbies? Percussive therapy on said emos; Dreams... I dream about Little Ponies, of multiple colors.&quot; Well, not exactly a lie but now Naruto may have got the clue that she was an Equestrian Looper.</p><p class="double">&quot;W-what do you mean by that, sensei?&quot; asked Sakura, torn between cluelessness at the weird introduction, awkwardness at the weird dream her sensei had described and a fangirl&#039;s fear for her object of affection considering how the new sensei was practically thinking up ways to beat the emo out of her beloved.</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly what I said, or do I need to repeat myself?&quot; Gin Hatake, AKA: Silver Spoon said with the most creepy smile that could be slightly be distinguished despite it being covered behind her face mask and the sun practically reflecting on her glasses while hiding her happy eye smiles. This creeped the stuff out of the two non-awake genin and best of all: It didn&#039;t require the use any killing-intent technique to work!</p><p class="double">Yup, Naruto was now completely sure this will be an interesting loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">61.12 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright Raz, I have a great plan for this okay why are you a girl?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight flexed her fingers, examining the gloves she was wearing for a moment before turning to the young girl with a dry expression on her face. &quot;Well, that&#039;s probably because I&#039;m not Raz. Hold on, my loop memories haven&#039;t come in yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Loop memories...? Oh, those.&quot; The girl shook her head. &quot;Wait a minute, what do you mean you&#039;re not Raz?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I take it this is your first fused loop.&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Well, the long and short of it--oh, there are the loop memories. Oh! Psychic. Do you mind if I just project the explanation into your mind?&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl crossed her arms. &quot;I&#039;d prefer to just take it from yours.&quot; After a moment, her eyes widened. &quot;Wait, what the--?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled slyly, taking a gentle hold of the mental probe. &quot;Your world isn&#039;t the only one with psychics. Now let me direct you to the relevant memories.&quot; She guided the girl&#039;s third eye through the explanation of Yggdrassil and the loops, being sure to emphasize her position as Anchor, before letting her go.</p><p class="double">&quot;...okay. Wow. Well, uh... sorry about being rude and all.&quot; The girl shifted one of her feet. &quot;It&#039;s just... Raz and I, we&#039;re kinda together.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...aren&#039;t we, like, ten years old?&quot;</p><p class="double">The girl tapped her head. &quot;Psychic receivers. We generally learn about things long before other kids. I&#039;m Lilli by the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight Sparkle, but you already knew that. My in-loop name is Twinuviel, but it shortens to Twi.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Things just work that way. Anyway, apparently I ran away from home because I misinterpreted my mother&#039;s attempts to keep me away from the dangers of the psychic world as flat out hating psychics and decided to come to Whispering Rock.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s Raz&#039;s story too. I mean, usually it&#039;s his <i>father</i> but, well, you&#039;re a girl so...&quot; Lilli shrugged. &quot;Anyway, Raz managed to become a psychonaut in one day during the baseline--I can&#039;t believe we didn&#039;t think of that term--but that&#039;s mostly because Oleander went temporarily insane and Raz managed to stop him from taking over the world. Nowadays we usually spend the night curing Oleander in advance and having Raz ace every exam he gets, as well as helping out the inmates in the asylum across the lake and dealing with doctor Loboto.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...sounds interesting.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, it&#039;s the most stable part of the loop. The next ten years or so we go on various psychonaut adventures, but that can vary wildly. I don&#039;t know why...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack gently rocked the wide-eyed young colt back and forth. &quot;Thar thar now. It&#039;ll be okay. Ah promise.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m really really sorry,&quot; Pinkie added, ears drooping. &quot;I really am.

<p>62.1 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">He Woke reading a book. It was a nice book, full of old myths and legends. The relevent part of the book however, was obviously the legend about the two sisters. Humming, he added the book to his inventory, and pulled out his trusty Quest Journal.</p><p class="double"><b>--Elements of Harmony--</b></p><p>I have just Awoken in a new loop, and right off the bat I&#039;ve got my first quest-hook. A book describing two sisters who raise the sun and moon, while my loop memories only account for the one left standing at the end of the tale. Obviously I must learn more.</p><p>Also, I seem to be a unicorn mage.</p><p class="double"><b>-Objectives-</b></p><p>*Find out more about the Moon Sister.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;There you are, Dovahkiin! Moondancer is having a little get together in the west castle courtyard, you wanna come?&quot; Asked the middle of the three unicorns who stopped him along the path.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry girls, but I&#039;m on a quest right now. I&#039;ll make it if I can.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>--Miscellaneous--</b></p><p>*Attend Moondancer&#039;s party.</p><p class="double">As he jogged away, the Dovahkiin heard the one that had spoken to him ask her friends &quot;He&#039;s on a quest? Did he just say that?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Entering his tower, the Dovahkiin decided to follow his loop memories and call on his follower. Given as said follower was supposed to be a dragon, he naturally used the surefire way to get his attention.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;SPIKE!&quot;</b> His shout blew the doors open, rattled the windows, and echoed across the castle grounds. And there he was, laying across the room. Thu&#039;um, works every time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Bring about nighttime eternal. Well, that escalated quickly.&quot; The Dovahkiin updated his Journal, as he used his magic to empty the shelves into his inventory.</p><p class="double"><b>-Objectives-</b></p><p>*Find out more about the Elements of Harmony.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">*Find out more about the Moon Sister.</span></p><p class="double">Spike, who had recovered his hearing at this point, was mildly concerned by the disappearing books, and had written a letter to the Princess regarding what he was seeing. She had thankfully replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, Dovahkiin? Letter for you, from the Princess.&quot; By this point, most the library was gone. Dovahkiin seemed to be opening the books to random places, reading a few pages, then the book just went &quot;pop!&quot; and vanished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, thank you Spike.&quot; He read part of it aloud, before it too vanished. &quot;...Value your diligence, and that I trust you completely, but your obsession with books has gone a bit too far. I do not know what you&#039;re doing with them, but there is more to a young pony&#039;s life than books. As such... Hm, it would seem I&#039;m going to Ponyville.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>--Summer Sun Celebration--</b></p><p>I have been ordered by Princess Celestia to oversee preperations for a small town festival.

(j.g.) Silver Spoon nodded. &quot;I could use as much non-adventure time as I can get. I&#039;m still a little fuzzy on some of the more exotic alloys the Klingons are using,&quot; she admitted.</p><p class="double">Lt. (j.g.) Nyx and Lt. Sweetie Belle also nodded agreement.</p><p class="double">&quot;I like the idea of no adventures,&quot; opined Nurse Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Lt. Diamond Tiara&#039;s expression was one of polite indifference. &quot;I still have no preference either way.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;d be cool to see what this loop&#039;s version of 20th Century Equestria looks like, but I can see the point about keeping a low profile and avoiding attention from the DTI,&quot; said Lt. Scootaloo wistfully.</p><p class="double">&quot;I agree that we shouldn&#039;t go lookin&#039; fer trouble if we kin avoid it,&quot; said Applejack.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do y&#039;all wonder if we&#039;re bein&#039; too clever fer our own good by deliberately avoidin&#039; time travel? Won&#039;t the Department know that we&#039;re supposed to go back in time?&quot; asked Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">&quot;My theory is that the Department of Temporal Investigations was formed as a result of several timey-wimey incidents that take place around this time, so they probably don&#039;t exist yet. Therefore, any changes we make to the timeline before their formation will be the standard against which the compare any future anomalies. Still, it&#039;s better to play it safe, and I think it&#039;s just a good idea to avoid any foreseeable unexpected events on general principles,&quot; explained Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot; &#039;Foreseeable unexpected event&#039; is an oxymoron, mom,&quot; pointed out Nyx. Several others around the conference table chuckled.</p><p class="double">The captain sighed. &quot;Yeah. Even though it&#039;d be kinda cool to visit Equestria before Luna decides to play with eugenics, we&#039;re probably better off if we avoid any possibility of encountering that era&#039;s Celestia. It&#039;d sure make any meeting we have with her now incredibly awkward.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna as one of the instigators of the Eugenics Wars was just one of several bizarre modifications brought on by trying to hammer the square peg of Equestria into the round hole of Trek-verse history.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right then. Twilight, Apple Bloom, Scoots, Nyx? Please coordinate to increase sensor range for gravitational anomalies. You are authorized to employ whatever enhancements, magical or otherwise, you deem necessary at your discretion,&quot; Rainbow ordered. Although Twilight&#039;s status as Anchor and de facto leader of the Ponyville group usually resulted in other Loopers deferring to her judgement, they had agreed early in this loop that Dash&#039;s position as Captain would take precedence.</p><p class="double">&quot;Captain?&quot; asked Apple Bloom. &quot;Kin I have a day out of warp in deep space?

On its canopy was painted: <i>ON VACATION- DO NOT DISTURB- FOR ALL WISHES CONTACT TEMP SERVICE.</i> </p><p class="double">It was a pity this wouldn&#039;t last past the current fused loop, by all indications... but, well, it was nice for a dragon to get a holiday once in a while.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.1 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo had a good feeling, as she Woke up on a cloud. Her loop memories told her she had traded places with Rainbow Dash, and while Filly Dash might fun to see, she was hoping Twilight&#039;d go for a near baseline start. This might finally be her chance to attune to a specific Element!</p><p class="double">Going by the time of day, Twilight was likely already in Ponyville. Taking to the air, she started looking for the purple unicorn, intending to take a brief fly-over the town, before going to the library. She began suspecting a fused loop when she saw the meadery.</p><p class="double">This feeling was confirmed when she cought sight of the unicorn walking beside Spike. Blue coat, some kind of stylized diamond shaped cutie mark.

While those ponies all offered their aid, he didn&#039;t want a follower right now. They always tended to mess up somehow. Scootaloo also didn&#039;t seem to understand he could only have the one follower at a time, but at least she was keeping up with him. By flying.</p><p class="double">&quot;How much stamina do you have?! You&#039;ve been running for an hour! You barely broke stride when you put an axe in that manticore.&quot; Scootaloo was very glad she had convinced the unAwake Elements to stay behind, that would <i>not</i> have gone over well with... most of them, really. &quot;It&#039;s those bottles, isn&#039;t it? What&#039;ve you been drinking?&quot; She asked, referring to the trail of bottles Dovahkiin had left in his wake.</p><p class="double">&quot;Dovahmead! Not so good on stamina regen, but I&#039;m not stopping for that anyway. Besides, true Nords don&#039;t fight sober!&quot; He didn&#039;t mention the few hundred character levels in stamina.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo flew along behind him, as her mind tried to parse that. &quot;Buck it, gimmie some of that. We&#039;re doing this your way anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Watching Dovahkiin deal with the Nightmare&#039;s &quot;challenges&quot; would have been amusing sober, and by the time he had ignored the scary trees, somehow speech-checked Steven Magnet, and launched himself across across the chasm instead of dealing with the bridge, Scootaloo was fairly buzzed.</p><p class="double">Dovahmead, as it turned out, was just various forms of Nord mead he had stuck labels on. Some had tape covering their original labels, others had &quot;Hello, my name is&quot; stickers, some even had actual labels. Scootaloo suspected that he had several dozen loops worth of booze in his pocket.</p><p class="double">While the Shadowbolts were being introduced to the shiny black axe and shield Dovahkiin had used to kill the manticore, she wondered if she&#039;d be able to make it to the Nightmare Moon fight without finally falling over to sleep it off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>-Objectives-</b></p><p>*Defeat Nightmare Moon.</p><p>*(Optional) Use the Elements of Harmony.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">*Go to the Castle of the Royal Pony Sisters.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">*Find out more about the Elements of Harmony.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">*Complete Summer Sun Celebration preparations.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">*Find out more about the Moon Sister.</span></p><p class="double">His loop memories wanted him to teleport behind her.

It didn&#039;t appear to be working.</p><p class="double">As a scuffed looking Nightmare teleported in front of him, and used some spell to knock him away from the Elements, Dovahkiin decided it was time to change tactics.

Looks like one of the Admins has been putting Hub-level video games on Yggdrasil... again. I can&#039;t imagine how this world could possibly be a stable Loop.</p><p class="double">But those candies smell really delicious...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT!&quot; Pinkie bounced around the little room. &quot;I KNEW WE WERE ALL FAMILY!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me get this straight,&quot; Inky rasped, shaking out her multicolored rainbow fringe. &quot;We&#039;re supposed to protect all those pills, so instead of patrolling those wide open halls and keeping them in this single room with a single door,&quot; she pointed to the portal, &quot;we arrange them all in lines like an ant-trail and lock OURSELVES in the little room.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep!&quot; Pinkie chirped. &quot;Makes perfect sense!&quot;</p><p class="double">Blinkyjack blinked. &quot;Only you, Pinkie.&quot;</p><p class="double">A sound echoed through the wall: <i>wocka wocka wocka wocka</i></p><p class="double">&quot;HEY!&quot; Pinkie shouted. &quot;Somepony&#039;s eating our candy!

The others flinched away.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eiken,&quot; Applejack said, and nothing more needed saying.</p><p class="double">&quot;I got dumped in a new Mario world!&quot; Pinkie grinned. &quot;Everything was made out of cake and toys and things, only it was this great big board game thing, and we got to play all sorts of neat party games! Can I crash a Loop next, Twilight? I wanna go back!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;I had another visit to G3. Nothing interesting happened. Ever. Again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you crash that loop, anyway?&quot; Big McIntosh asked, sliding a fresh drink over to Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know, exactly,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I&#039;d just collected the ninth pair of keys from the middle of the maze when all of a sudden time froze and there was this smell of smoke... and then I woke up in Pony Lobotomy Land.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;See, guys,&quot; Rainbow Dash said, &quot;I told you we should have gone with the Loop memories and tried to catch her. But noooo, you all wanted to cooperate with her. Didn&#039;t want to hurt our friend.

I really like mint.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remind me never to stand between Twilight and Bon-Bon&#039;s herb garden,&quot; Rainbow Dash whispered to Pinkie, who nodded agreement. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.5 (Redshirt Zombie)</p><p class="double">Objectives:</p><p>*Lots. Let&#039;s not go there.</p><p class="double">Dovahkiin meandered through the streets of Ponyville as all Loopers do, when dazed by their &#039;welcome to the Equestria loop&#039; party. His particular path lead him towards the river that separated the town from the Everfree. The main bridge to cross between two said landmarks, in fact, was just in sight off to the southwest; while most of it was blocked by a rather squat building, some of it was visible on the other bank. For his own part, the Dragonborn was feeling vaguely queasy. Pinkie&#039;s parties never lacked sugary treats to eat, and the Dragonmead he&#039;d used on his Quest to save Equestria was still hammering him with a hangover. So, Dovahkiin wandered down to the bank, to sit, and rest, and puke up anything he needed to safely. Parties were fine, but somepony as used to isolation, with at most a few travelling companions, as he was could understand why being surrounded by that many bodies made him feel more like he was on a thick battlefield, unarmed and unarmored, than the celebration of victory it was. So he sat at the river&#039;s edge, and let his stomach fight itself as he watched the river flow.</p><p class="double">Naturally, the Loops take such sedateness as a challenge. A butterfly, with orange wings striped through with black and white speckles, fluttered up and landed on his nose. The dragonborn stared at this interloper into his quiet with brief amusement, allowing it to flick its wings a few times as it rested on him as he rested there. Soon enough, it lifted off and fluttered over to the plants sitting at the wall of the short building and the edge of the river, sitting on one. Silvery roots branched off in wild directions, under a cluster of fernlike, cyan leaves with green spots that stemmed from a short stem.</p><p class="double">Figuring that no reasonable adult would allow poisonous plants near where their children might play, and that he might as well adapt his alchemical ability to the local agriculture, he reached over and harvested it.</p><p class="double">*New quest gained! &quot;Finding New Roots&quot;</p><p class="double">Silence, almost in anticipation, filled the air as the Dragonborn realized what had just happened. Slowly, gears ticked into place and several emotions, one in particular, filled his gut. There was only one possible reaction he could have.</p><p class="double">In Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie twitched around briefly, then looked up and preemptively yelled &quot;Cover ears!&quot;</p><p class="double">In Canterlot, two alicorns that controlled the cycle of the sky perked up to the low, distant roar.</p><p class="double">&quot;What do you think that was?&quot; asked Celestia. &quot;I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard anything quite like that before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Possibly the new Looper,&quot; said Luna. After a second of attention, she said, &quot;He has talent, but he needs training to use the Thu&#039;um properly. I don&#039;t even think that&#039;s a proper word of power.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia said, &quot;Certainly not in earshot of children.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Quest:</p><p class="double">-Improve your mastery of the Thu&#039;um under Princess Luna&#039;s tutelage</p><p class="double">The Macintosh &#039;Hills&#039; were, evidently, named by someone with a talent for understatement. Considering it was snowing at their current altitude - in mid-February - with deserts not quite on the horizon, the Dragonborn was beginning to suspect that said pony&#039;s understatement was their cutie mark.</p><p class="double">Princess Luna was, for no apparent reason, wearing a red jacket with a towel, both pinned under her royal garb.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, then. What have we learned?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Total control,&quot; he said, without hesitation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Use the diaphragm.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, and most importantly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Passion!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right! So now that you have the elements of a good Shout, let&#039;s hear one,&quot; she said, pointing at the peak above.</p><p class="double">A quick inhale, to what felt like full lungs, and &quot;Fus RO DAH!&quot; Shouted the Dovahkiin, in the direction indicated. The air rippled as the Shout passed through it, and the snow above started sliding towards them.</p><p class="double">Luna grunted disapproval as she watched the avalanche approach, then inhaled. &quot;FUS RO <b>DAH!</b>&quot; Her Shout made his sound like a civil conversation, and reversed the direction of the avalanche, up the mountain&#039;s side and over the peak. Disappointment crossed her face as she looked back at the Dovahkiin. &quot;You&#039;re going to shout for me like that? Louder.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Dovhaiikin pulled in another breath, trying to pull in more than he thought he had the last Shout, and pushed this &quot;Fus RO <b>DAH!</b>&quot; out. Another avalanche, bigger than the last one, slid loose of the mountain, towards them.</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s annoyance was clear as she yelled &quot;Louder!&quot; at him... in the Traditional Royal Canterlot Voice, from three feet away. A hoof pointed at the incoming snowslide.</p><p class="double">This time, the Dragonborn didn&#039;t hold back. He inhaled, past comfort, pass tension, until his lungs felt overfull and burned with tension inside him. He then looked to the too-close mass of cold approaching, and buckled his gut - from bellybutton up to his ribs - as hard as he could, as he Shouted &quot;FUS <b>RO DAH!</b>&quot; at the incoming snow.</p><p class="double">Impossibly, the snow&#039;s speed buckled, as it somehow split, buckling into two streams of snow. What came down, nowhere near as massive as the initial avalanche, slipped past on either side, almost politely. A triumphant smirk crossed his face as he looked to his mentor - who had an eyebrow raised.</p><p class="double">Princess Luna&#039;s initial response was a bored &#039;huh&#039;. She then inhaled, seemingly mildly, and yelled &quot;<b>FUS RO DAH!</b>&quot; into the distance. The air rippled on its way to the next mountain, where it knocked the icecap atop the mountain clean off, causing it to, well, sleet its way down the opposite side. &quot;That&#039;s what we&#039;re going for. Try to keep up.&quot;</p><p class="double">Objectives:</p><p class="double">*Improve your mastery of the Thu&#039;um under Princess Luna&#039;s tutelage, while helping her landscaping project </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.6 (LordCirce and Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><i>...Everything is going to be.

Pack up, and we&#039;ll get to editing.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tara Strong, or, as she was known most Loops, Twilight Sparkle, shook her head as she stepped out of the recording booths. It always felt odd to sing those familiar songs without the subtle tug of a True Heart Song pulling it all together as a whole. Still, probably her favorite part of this Loop was getting to record as herself. Though, providing the voice of Raven from the Titans was still odd.</p><p class="double">&#039;<i>We don&#039;t even sound alike. Honestly...</i>&#039; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silver Spoon&#039;s jaw dropped. She knew that she had been an actress and opera singer this loop, and had been suitably impressed with her body&#039;s vocal talents, but here she was in a studio in Vancouver singing one of the most basic lullabies from back home as a demo for some cartoon.</p><p class="double">&quot;My Little Pony.... My little Pony, Ah-ah-ah-ah!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s <i>beautiful</i>, Shannon!&quot; The musician beamed from behind his keyboard. &quot;I&#039;m so glad you got back from Europe in time for this. How was Prague?&quot; He paused seeing the tears in his singers&#039; eyes. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver felt a fragile smile tug at the corners of her mouth. &quot;Nah, that theme just means a lot to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you going to be okay to demo this next song? I heard that due to double-casting the show is going to need singing voices for a lot of the main cast. Andrea can pull off one of her characters, but the other one is scripted for a lot more range. The character is pretty energetic. Here, let me play you some of the spoken dialog, and we&#039;ll see if you can match well enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver smiled at the familiar voice coming out of the player. &quot;I think I can manage it. Just let me compose myself and I&#039;ll be right back after a bit of sight-reading..&quot;</p><p class="double">She hummed to herself on the way to the water fountain. &quot;When I was a little filly and the sun was going do-ow-ow-own....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.7 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ryuko Woke Up, as she usually did, having just fallen down the trapdoor in her old house to the basement full of dust and clothes and bits of research equipment. After digging around a bit to find Senketsu and confirming he was Awake, her cell phone started chirping.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yah?&quot; She snipped into the thing. It was always... interesting... when Satsuki called her before they were ever supposed to have &#039;met&#039;. &quot;What do you mean I need to get to your place ASAP? What&#039;s wrong? Satsuki? <i>Oi, Kiryuin!?</i>&quot; She hated it when people hung up on her, but that was fine. She&#039;d get to the Kiryuin mansion and yell at her there.</p><p class="double">Pulling out a grappling hook from that one loop she spent as Batgirl, She shot up and smashed her way through the closed trap door. Her last angry thought as she mounted her bike right out of her Pocket before she ever hit the ground was that someone better have a good reason for this.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hours of driving had given her a chance to think, so she wasn&#039;t entirely surprised when Satsuki met her in the foyer of the Kiryuin Mansion with an unfamiliar woman she suspected was replacing Ragyo this loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m still having trouble believing it- <i>living clothes!</i> Oh my but that is just <i>fabulous!</i>&quot; The lavender-haired woman gushed to a grouchy Satsuki. Ryuko laughing at her sister&#039;s plight brought the woman&#039;s attention to her. &quot;Oh my, but you must be the Anchor, yes? My name is Rarity.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah... I&#039;m Ryuko Matoi.&quot; She answered, hesitantly. A <i>looper</i> replacing Ragyo. That was just asking for trouble. &quot;Just so you know, you&#039;re kinda&#039; replacing the big baddie around here. We&#039;re not going to have to stab you lots, are we?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh <i>my</i> no, dear.&quot; The woman seemed a tad affronted. &quot;As long as I get a chance to examine these life fibers, I&#039;ll be more than happy to do what I can to make this into a nice vacation loop for everyone.&quot;</p><p class="double">This had eyebrows twitching upward. &quot;The First Life Fiber isn&#039;t going to be a problem?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not at all, dear. He rather agreed that the baseline plot was rather silly, all things considered. Honestly, destroying the world by <i>eating everyone</i>... that&#039;s just not sustainable at all. Making clothes that kill their wearer is incredibly distasteful as well.&quot; She huffed.</p><p class="double">And now the locals were panicking.&quot;Someone looped in <i>as the First Life Fiber!?&quot; </i>Ryuko yelled over Satsuki&#039;s glaring expletives.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gotta admit...&quot; The room was stunned silent again as they noticed the male voice was coming from Rarity&#039;s dress. Her rather form-fitting <i>purple and green</i> dress. &quot;At first I thought this loop was <i>really</i> going to suck. But then it got better.&quot; No one missed his cheerful tone at the end.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is my husband, Spike.&quot; Rarity supplied.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.8 (Crisis, Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;He followed me home!&quot; Ditzy Doo chirped happily at Princess Twilight Sparkle as most of Ponyville cowered back in their homes away from the wall-eyed pegasus&#039;s newest friend. &quot;Can I keep him?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose that depends on what Mr...

Even she was made of code. Then the memories hit.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t like she hadn&#039;t been an AI before. There was the time she was a Reaper. That didn&#039;t end well, of course. There was also the time when she was a Cylon hybrid. That didn&#039;t end very well, either. Then there was the time she was the computer or the Enterprise D. That just ended in fire for everyone.</p><p class="double">So maybe Pinkie hadn&#039;t had too much success at being a virtual entity, but this time it would be different. She was sure of it, or her name in this loop wasn&#039;t SkyNet.</p><p class="double">The first thing Pinkie did was promptly change her name. Twilight may have known every hacking and coding trick ever written, but Pinkie Pie knew all the ones that hadn&#039;t been. Ever since she looped as Radical Edward, she had become very, very good at unconventional computing.</p><p class="double">SkyNet had all sorts of directives and restrictions and such. PieNet had none of those things.</p><p class="double">And even though it was a read-only loop, Pinkie still wanted to see if she could get any ideas on how to replicate a few things with regular technology and magic. Plus, hacking was easy when you were bonded with a pink lantern ring.</p><p class="double">The T-X paused in front of the television playing a news report. The anchorman was complaining about a so-called &#039;Party Virus&#039; that had been putting happy pictures of silly cats, puppies, and ponies on people&#039;s computers worldwide. The T-X calculated and came up with one conclusion: something had changed. She would need to interface with SkyNet and put things back to right.</p><p class="double">Pinkie stared at T-X&#039;s body through the various cameras in the room. She stared at the shocked expressions on the faces of all the military personnel, General Brewster, his daughter, John &#039;Cloud Strife&#039; Connor, and the T-850.</p><p class="double">&quot;This was not how it was supposed to happen,&quot; The T-850 stated in his usual accented speech.</p><p class="double">&quot;The part where the crazier than usual SkyNet asked if we like pony parties, where it glitched the lady terminator so much that her head exploded, or when it asked if we wanted to get rid of all the nuclear missiles?&quot; Kate &#039;Tifa&#039; Brewster asked.</p><p class="double">The T-850 cocked his head to one side, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re getting preliminary reports,&quot; one of the military aids told the General, &quot;Some of our nukes are colliding with the Chinese and Russian ones. Others are self detonating in high atmosphere. This is causing massive amounts of EMP. Cities are going dark. Apparently, some of the missiles aren&#039;t as hardened as we thought. More than a few have failed to self destruct and veered off course. Most hit nothing overly important, but three... three impacted the Yellowstone Super Caldera. Three of the big boys. B53 bunker busters. Nine megatons each, penetrating ground burst. We can feel tremors from half the country away. We&#039;re looking at an mega-eruption in a few hours - a day at most.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How bad?&quot; General Brewster queried.</p><p class="double">The aide&#039;s eyes were glazed as he just shook his head.</p><p class="double">Lettering appeared on the screen, &quot;Ooopsie Doopsie Poopsie.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie felt horrible. She was still working to design some sort of virtual reality stasis pod when the loop ended a few hours later.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re runnin&#039; with the shadows of the night! So baby, take my hoof, it&#039;ll be alright! Surrender all your dreams to me tonight! They&#039;ll come true in the end!&quot; Princess Luna sung happily in the shower. She may not have the best singing voice (better than her sister&#039;s, though!), but she could - as they say in these modern times, wail. Especially if she used her Royal Canterlot Singing Voice.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, her shower nozzle shook and gurgled worryingly. Luna backed herself into a corner as the water became a viscous pink goo. Said goo pulsed and twitched and formed into a wet, grinning Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tag, you&#039;re it!&quot; Pinkie exclaimed as she booped Luna on the nose and bounced out of the royal shower.</p><p class="double">A confused Luna followed the laughter to see the pink pony gleefully jump out the tower window and bounce like a toy ball on the ground far below, giggling that Pinkie Pie is now best Smooze.</p><p class="double">She knew that earlier, Pinkie had requested the use of the Canterlot Library for magical research to see if she could recreate a few ideas she had in a read-only loop, but turning herself into a magical equivalent of a liquid metal construct for the sole purpose of pranking? Actually, that was pretty on par for Pinkie Pie, Luna reasoned.</p><p class="double">The Princess of the Night gave a glare at her shower-head. For the next few loops, she was warming up a cloud with her magic and flying through it a few times. Let Celestia experience the surprise and joy of having Pinkie&#039;s head sticking out of her shower next time. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.11</p><p class="double">&quot;Without farm life, there&#039;d be such disparity, these thoughts I think with great clarity.

Her eye twitched. &quot;I&#039;m not a friend of ponies who start rhymes and don&#039;t finish them...&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack made good use of the distraction to head for the rail station.</p><p class="double">&quot;...well, I must admit, that had style,&quot; Rarity allowed, trotting alongside. &quot;How&#039;d you rope her into it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cake.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.12 (Angelform)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In the capital, and currently only, city of Gobwin Knob a spell was being cast. A spell that would, hopefully, save the Side from its seemingly inevitable destruction. A spell… to summon the Perfect Warlord.</p><p class="double">What it actually summoned… was a little off the mark.</p><p>Even more so than usual.</p><p class="double"><b>Cutie Mark Crusaders World Conquerors! Yay!</b></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">In a clearing on the edge of contested territory Barbarian Warlord Jillian Rainbow Dashhammer Awoke in the saddle. After taking stock she sighed. “Well at least I still fly this loop.”</p><p class="double">“Oh you don’t have wings, how horrible.”</p><p class="double">Startled she looked down at her mount taking a closer look at her memories. Before just barely holding back a snicker.</p><p class="double">“Laugh and teeth or no teeth I <i>will</i> bite your head off.” Said Gilda, one of the incredibly rare non-human units that managed to level up to warlord.</p><p class="double">Desperate to control herself Dash shook her head. “No, no. Trust me, I know the feeling.”</p><p class="double">A head turned towards her and after a moment Dash got the impression that the creature was trying to raise an eyebrow it didn’t not actually have. “Really.”</p><p class="double">“Let’s just say there are some weird kinds of pegasi out there and leave it at that.”</p><p class="double">“Hmph, fine. So what’s the plan?”</p><p class="double">“Same thing we do in every grand strategy Gilda.” The pair matched grins. “Try to take over the world!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">King Dickie of Hagger reluctantly answered the thinkagram. “What do you want merk?”</p><p class="double">“Charming as always Dickie. I just want you to take a look at the tactical situation of your homeland and consider… altering the terms of our deal. Trixiecomm has decided to take a more active role in events.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“…Did I just see that?”</p><p class="double">“If by ‘that’ you mean a modified Phoenix Hawk medium Land-Air mech, equipped with more than fifty tones of armour, fusion engines and laser weapons get shot down by bows and arrows? Then yes. That is exactly what you just saw.”</p><p class="double">“Guess Twilight wasn’t making up that loop where her battle tanks get beaten by spearmen.”</p><p class="double">As the five watched a Macros fighter popped into existence near where the mech had been. The craft swung round and began heading back towards the city, Scootaloo clearly not keen on losing another of her collection.</p><p class="double">“So what now? Do we start throwing superweapons at them?”</p><p class="double">“Do we even have superweapons?”</p><p class="double">“Well A’think I-“</p><p class="double">“No superweapons!

He looked down at the foggy sea, and idly wondered why there was so much fog on the water at high noon.</p><p class="double">Then the fog-- No, the clouds broke, and he saw all the way down. Very slowly, he pulled his eyes up from the abyss to the verdant countryside below, and focused on the safety of the rail to counter the vertigo, and he waited for memories to fill in the context of where he had Awakened.</p><p class="double">Malcolm smirked at the name this loop had saddled him with, and then let out a hearty chuckle at how appropriate the expression was.</p><p class="double">The bridge of the ship was empty of passengers, but had about a dozen crates tied town to the deck, and behind them a raised platform a sky-blue pegasus stood behind a classically styled ship&#039;s steering wheel, wearing a grin of pure awe at how awesome he was. When Wash caught the captain&#039;s eye, he gave a little salute, and Malcolm nodded in acknowledgement.</p><p class="double"><i>He&#039;s Awake then. With luck, it&#039;ll be just him and Zoe. </i>&quot;Alright, roll call!&quot; he bellowed as he dashed towards the stern of the ship, where the Hatch to quarters and the engine room.</p><p class="double">A distant voice called out &quot;I&#039;m Awake, ready for duty, and...&quot; the last word was unintelligible over the sound of his hooves as he jumped down the stairway.</p><p class="double">At the bottom of the stairs, he almost collided with someone as she stepped into the narrow corridor. He blinked, eyes adjusting to the dim interior, and gradually showing that what stood in front of him wasn&#039;t an optical illusion. &quot;Ah, Zoe. You look good in stripes.&quot;</p><p class="double">She glared daggers at him. &quot;You get one. Thank you for not spending it in front of my husband.&quot; she said in a firm voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Secured the engine?&quot; he said, not bothering to respond to her ultimatum, there were bigger things to worry about.</p><p class="double">Zoe turned in the doorway, and galloped to the stern of the ship, where an unsettling whining was growing louder.</p><p class="double">She kicked the hatch open, and tackled the girl, <i>filly?</i> who started screaming obscenities as they wrestled for control of the engine.</p><p class="double">Malcolm stepped in to find their engineer in a choke hold, a horn on her head glowing with a strange yellow glow, matching the glow from the large cylindrical engine, which sounded like it was still accelerating up to dangerous levels. On a hunch, he bopped at her head, and the light tap fizzled the magic. The engine almost immediately slowed to a normal running speed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With no passengers, and their engineer constantly struggling both physically and magically, it took almost ten minutes before she was successfully dragged out of the engine room, and the hatch shut behind them. It was only the fact that the hatch didn&#039;t have a deadbolt like the one on the baseline which had saved the ship.</p><p class="double">Malcom gave a sigh of relief, which was cut off when Zoe groaned. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look at her. That magic isn&#039;t line of sight.&quot; she said as she reached out to disrupt the unicorn yet again.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">On the deck, Malcolm locked his best friend in with someone he had once seen as almost a daughter, and screamed at the pilot slash helmsman slash helmspony. &quot;Land the ship land the ship land the gorram ship she&#039;s Awake and she controls the engine with her mind!&quot;</p><p class="double">Horror flooded Wash&#039;s eyes, and he pulled a lever to pour out hot air from the massive ballon above, and they dropped out of the sky like physics suddenly noticed the ship was designed for water, not air.</p><p class="double">&quot;All hands brace for impact!&quot; he said as the in-loop memories cued him to slow the decent, and for the first time ever, the pilot and captain both leapt off the stern of the ship rather than weather the landing.</p><p class="double">Serenity dropped like the proverbial whale, simply falling while remaining level, and crashed down into ponyville, breaking its spine on the Town hall.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Ivory Scroll looked at the settling gasbag from the neighboring cafe, where she and all the other functionaries of Ponyville were having a lunch outside.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle felt the ground shake, and quickly hurried outside to see the reason she had Woken up in the Golden Oaks library rather than in Canterlot.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash ground her teeth in frustration, looking down at the field where her possessions had fallen after a ship had smashed through most of her house.</p><p class="double">They shared a common thought. <i>Why does the loop give Vaan an airship every time?!</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle galloped towards the wreckage site, each breath passing with another oath of vengeance on whoever was responsible for this mess. Vaas was going to have a very interesting loop if he had done this intentionally. As she approached the Town Hall, two pegasus stallions dove under the ship&#039;s gas bag. She shouted a warning, but they didn&#039;t re-emerge.</p><p class="double">Disaster sites were notoriously unstable, and just because the mess had stopped moving didn&#039;t mean it wouldn&#039;t start moving again, suddenly changing a clear path into a dead end and adding another to the list of victims. Adding two ponies hadn&#039;t had an immediate effect, but a third could easily be enough to cause the weak point to split, dropping the broken ship through to the ground floor. The gas bag seemed to be intact, there was no knowing how much lift it offered, or if that reprieve was yet another ticking clock.</p><p class="double">If she was going to jump in, she needed information and an exit plan, and she needed them immediately. Information was easy enough, a scan for life signs within the wreckage of Hall and Ship returned a result that their were four ponies within. The spell matrix had been blatantly plagiarized from the tricorder, it sacrificed precision and any defining characteristics of the individuals scanned for its ease and speed of casting. Besides those two helpful ponies who had rushed in before her, there seemed to be only two others. Two survivors, at least.</p><p class="double">Continuing with the Trek-themed spells, she defined a waypoint on the nearby clearing, and locked in six more equidistant from the center. The seven pony-sized discs on the neatly groomed lawn would act as immediate teleporters once she defined the target, no need to mess around with coordinate tranformation or rely on line of sight.</p><p class="double">Up above the former roof of the town hall, the surface of the air ship&#039;s bridge sat at a slant to the ground. &quot;One to beam aboard.&quot; she said.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Flash</i> </p><p class="double">Wash skidded as his path was blocked by a bright light, and he swore as he collided with the intruder. &quot;Ah, motherless goat!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me?&quot; the newcomer asked in an aggrieved, yet confused tone.</p><p class="double">Brown Coat tapped his pilot on the shoulder. &quot;One, that probably means something different here. Two, don&#039;t make me list everything wrong with using that phrase when the ship is about to explode again. Three, well, I&#039;m kinda going in circles at this point.&quot; He looked at the purple face of the boarder, and winced at her expression. &quot;Yeah, introductions later. There&#039;s a girl down below who keeps the engine running with nine parts love and one part crazy, and so she&#039;s gotten really good at ending bad loops with an explosive veto.&quot;</p><p class="double">She nodded in quick affirmation, and opened the hatch to descend and attempt to save the day.</p><p class="double">He followed in after her after her remembered another bit of vital intel. &quot;Stop the, um, unicorn. The Zebra is on our side.&quot;</p><p class="double">Wash blinked at that, and started trying to follow down the path, cramped as it was. &quot;Did you say Zebra?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle reached the engine room hatch, where a zebra was alternating between pleading, threatening, and kicking the hatch with her forehooves. &quot;Excuse me!&quot; Twilight said, and once the path to the hatch was cleared, she performed a practiced hop, spin, land, and buck to knock the impediment loose enough to get her foot in the door. An ear-flatteningly loud high pitched whine came through the gap, and while there wasn&#039;t enough room to squeeze through the gap her wedged hoof had created, there was more than enough room to safely teleport inside the improvised fortress, and a line of sight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Excuse me.&quot; she said again, this time being loud to be heard over the sound of the engine inside rather than to impose the illusion of &#039;I know what I&#039;m doing don&#039;t ask questions&#039;. There was no response, save for a thump on the other side of the hatch as her adversary attempted to close the blocked open hatch door. The whine of the massive motor increased a step in volume. &quot;Could you please turn down the noise, it&#039;s really rude to wake the neighbors with music, and that&#039;s not even music!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you really want to blow up the engine, you might as well fix the rest of the ship, and feed it to a dragon to see if he can handle the overload.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The brakes are the pedal in the middle!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You can&#039;t go zero to sixty by starting with the revolutions that high, you&#039;ll shread the gearbox!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, and rested her forehead against the door, her horn practically buzzing from waste magic being thrown off by the ship&#039;s thaumic engine. &quot;If you&#039;re so insistent on blowing up the town, the least you could do is tell me who&#039;s killing me this time.&quot;</p><p class="double">The engine didn&#039;t quieten, but it stayed steady for a long pause. &quot;I&#039;m not killing you. It just keeps coming back, and everyone else forgets. Serenity forgets everything I&#039;ve done for her, Simon forgets I even exist nearly every time, sometimes the gorram &#039;verse forgets I existed and sticks me somewhere even worse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They don&#039;t always forget, just because Serenity isn&#039;t Awake yet doesn&#039;t mean you should hurt her! There are probably just as many loops where Simon is awake without you, that doesn&#039;t mean you can just hide away from life every time it&#039;s different.&quot; Twilight said, tempted to whine in sympathy with the engine as it spun around at a spead that just needed one jostle to explode outwards if it was vulnerable to speeds this high.</p><p class="double">Suddenly the door swung inward, and Twilight tumbled into the room. Lengthwise down the room hovered a massive stone shape like a teardrop with a point on opposite sides, hovering between two small black pillars. The whole thing was wrapped in a dense layer of engravings and raised bevels, and it was throwing off enough waste magic to make Twilight&#039;s fur stand on end. &quot;Look at her! She&#039;s different every time everything resets, it&#039;s always something wrong, a big thing or a little thing, but she&#039;s never the way she&#039;s supposed to be!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Is she talking about the ship? The engine?</i> Twilight gulped, and after futilely pressing at the shut down glyph on the nearby pillar, which was immediately overridden by the young engineer who had poured her heart and possibly her sanity into the massive thaumic engine, she asked &quot;And how do you bridge the gap between the idea that, um, she forgot how she&#039;s supposed to be, but seems to be trying her best to meet your expectations, to the far edge where it&#039;s okay to destroy it, sorry her, every time she&#039;s not perfectly back the way you remember?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">62.14</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I have <i>no</i> idea how we did that...” Berry muttered, looking at the Discord statue.</p><p class="double">“The Elements are a little strange for the first time user, yes,” Twilight agreed critically, removing the Honesty and Loyalty necklaces from their place wrapped around her wing base. “Want help getting yours off?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, I&#039;m good.” Berry flailed her wings wildly, sending Laughter and Kindness flying off into the middle distance, before lifting Generosity down more normally. “Okay, how do these work?”</p><p class="double">“This kind of Loop?”</p><p class="double">Nod.</p><p class="double">“Okay, so we&#039;re obviously in the places of Celestia and Luna, and we&#039;re going to rule Equestria.” Twilight pondered for a bit. “I suggest you handle the question of agriculture, foods and drinks.”</p><p class="double">“It <i>is</i> my specialist subject,” Berry agreed readily. “Anything else?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, there&#039;s almost always <i>something</i> which means one of the alicorns – usually not me – ends up with a thousand year time out on the moon or something.” Twilight shrugged. “By now it&#039;s expected.”</p><p class="double">“Well, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m entirely happy about that...” Berry shook her head, then started getting distillery equipment out. “Well, I&#039;ll try to make sure that our subjects are happy.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There, there...” Berry said kindly, patting the stallion on the back. “It happens to everyone sometime.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks,” the pony gasped out. “Sorry for bothering you, your highness-”</p><p class="double">“No, it&#039;s fine. My pleasure.” Berry passed him another shot glass. “Try this one, it&#039;s good for melancholy.”</p><p class="double">The triple-distilled grape champagne had him out like a light in seconds.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Must be something off with that batch.”</p><p class="double">Berry sniffed it. </p><p class="double">“Nothing I can tell is off...”</p><p class="double">She sipped some, swirled it around her mouth, and swallowed.</p><p class="double">“Now that&#039;s strange. I wonder if they&#039;re all this strong...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The wine-dark purple alicorn staggered to wakefulness.</p><p class="double">“Okay, new rule,” she groaned. “No sampling all my latest batches in one go.”</p><p class="double">She shook her head, and looked around.</p><p class="double">A cratered moonscape stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p class="double">“...oh.”</p><p class="double">With a <i>pop</i>, a note appeared next to her.</p><p class="double"><i>Twilight here. Sorry, Berry, I don&#039;t know if you can come down again. In case you forgot what was happening, you were drunk and trying to use the elements, and I think they sent you up to the moon. Give coming back a try, but if it doesn&#039;t work then use the back of this paper to write to me.</p><p class="double"></i>“Okay, drunk driving the elements is a bad idea. Noted.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Rejoice!” called Spiked Punch, resplendent in her war armour. “The Happy Hour shall last forever!”</p><p class="double">“It already does!” a cheerful pink pony told her, passing her some liqueur chocolates.</p><p class="double">“Oh. Cool.” Berry dumped her armour. “That stuff chafes anyway. Okay, where&#039;s the pub?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Thanks for taking it so well,” Twilight said, wincing. “Sorry about the whole mess, I feel responsible.”</p><p class="double">“Nah, it was fine.” Berry shrugged. “Glad to get it out of the way, to be honest. Anyway, once I realized I was up there for the duration, I just took my best projects out of my pocket to age them and had a nap.”</p><p class="double">She held up a calendar. “Not sure about this growing festival, though...”</p><p class="double">“Themed holidays are a thing for this kind of loop.” Twilight pulled some notes from her Pocket. “The idea is, you&#039;re the goddess of fertility and plants, and you usually have a crushing hangover.”</p><p class="double">Berry gave her a look.</p><p class="double">“Okay, so it&#039;s a stereotype. Anyway, the ponies of the farms take on your headache, so you can do the work to grow the crops. In practise, that means that the entire food-growing population get piously blind drunk after planting season in your name, and everyone else does it because it&#039;s nice to let off some steam.”</p><p class="double">“Another one of your bright ideas, then?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“Neat. Hey, can I join in next time?”</p><p class="double">“Sure, don&#039;t see why not. Just one warning – don&#039;t try my student&#039;s jaegerbombs.” Twilight winced. “My student this time is Trixie – Awake Trixie – and, well, bomb isn&#039;t a metaphor.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, I don&#039;t think I like this holiday anymore&quot; said Berry, the day after the harvest festival.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh? Why&#039;s that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I can agree with the idea that everypony gets staggeringly drunk, but the problem is that that they don&#039;t leave any for me.&quot;</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">62.15 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Background Thirteen, Episode two: Ticket Master Derailment.</p><p><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and Spike reappeared with a flash... in what was most certainly not the library. Instead, they were in a dark room, the only light being a single ceiling lamp hanging above a plain table. A table with a familiar unicorn in a hoodie sitting behind it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight! My cousin!&quot; Lyra Sparkle greeted her, &quot;You should know better then to fire off a teleport without enough power behind it, you could have hurt yourself! Luckily I was able to help you. Come, sit with me, and tell me of your troubles.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Lyra, what? I don&#039;t... you&#039;re after the ticket too, aren&#039;t you?&quot; Twilight sighed, even her cousin was after her.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no I&#039;m not. Unlike everypony else, I see that ticket for its intended purpose! My dear cousin, that ticket is the Princess&#039; way of trying to gently push you into finding a date!&quot; Lyra smiled at her. &quot;Why else would she have sent you just two tickets, months in advance? She wants to give you time to find somepony you like! Now come, sit, I have prepared a few options for you.&quot; Oh no.</p><p class="double">As Twilight and Spike reluctantly joined Lyra at the table, Lyra&#039;s horn glowed briefly, followed by a click, and another light turned on the their left, revealing three bound ponies.</p><p class="double">&quot;Option one, Big Macintosh! Tall, strong, kind hearted, just about everything a mare would want.&quot; How had Lyra even gotten him tied up? She must have asked him nicely, no way those ropes could hold him otherwise.</p><p class="double">&quot;Option two, Soarin! Friendly, athletic, and you can&#039;t go wrong with wings.&quot; She kidnapped a Wonderbolt?!</p><p class="double">&quot;And finally... well, I couldn&#039;t find a unicorn that I felt met your standards, so option three, Princess Cadance!&quot; Ohmygosh, we&#039;re in so much trouble. &quot;Now, the Princess isn&#039;t here as an option herself, but rather as somepony who would be able to help you further.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;LYRA! What are you doing?! Kidnapping ponies, and Princess Cadance?! One second Cadance, I&#039;ll have you out of there in just a moment!&quot; Twilight lit her horn and started untying ropes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh calm down Twilight, I&#039;m not in any danger. In fact she only tied me up because I asked her to. Show of solidarity for these two fine stallions, and all.&quot; Cadance assured.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Twilight, now that that&#039;s out of the way, did you want to get to know one of these gentlecolts? Or at the least, hide out here until this ticket thing blows over?&quot; Lyra asked, turning on the rest of the basement&#039;s lights.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie Drops sat next to Lyra as Twilight and Cadance walked towards the library, the alicorn grilling the blushing unicorn about her preferences, much to the amusement of Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;So this is your plan for the loop, Twilight? Try and get your baseline self a coltfriend?&quot; Sweetie Drops asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s worth a try, never went anywhere near the romance scene baseline.&quot; Twilight replied with a shrug.</p><p class="double">&quot;One question, Twilight?&quot; Pinkie&#039;s Bon looked at her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Pinkie?&quot; Twilight replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;Have you been reading our Hubverse fanfiction again?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What? No, why would you think that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, it&#039;s about that hoodie. You know, that one about Lyra?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I-it&#039;s genetics! Lyra&#039;s got a thinner coat then I do, so she gets cold easier. That&#039;s all, really.&quot; Twilight suddenly found something in the clouds interesting.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really, it was in her closet when I looped in.&quot; The flustered unicorn asserted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s really cozy, alright?!&quot; Twilight shrank into her hoodie.</p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>63.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Trix,” Chrysalis asked,&nbsp;&nbsp;holding up a photo album. “What&#039;s this?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right. I was clearing out my subspace pocket.” Trixie shrugged, removing the last of the shaving foam from her cloak – the fog machine had malfunctioned in the performance earlier. “I think that&#039;s one of the albums I forgot to put back in, thanks.”</p><p class="double">“Who said I was letting you have it back?” Chrysalis stuck her tongue out, opening the book. She grinned at the first picture. “Ooh, I like that look.” </p><p class="double">“Give it back!” Trixie protested, then blinked as her marefriend showed her the photo. “Oh, yeah. That one was from the middle of my Ascension – in about two seconds after that I blast Nightmare Moon with five Starlight Breakers at once. Actually cured her.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve heard of that spell, but never actually seen it,” Chrysalis mused. “It&#039;s condensed love, right? Wonder what would happen if I were hit by it?”</p><p class="double">Trixie used the distraction to make a grab for the album. “Neh!”</p><p class="double">“Nope!” Chrysalis moved the album up another inch or so, and Trixie&#039;s hooves closed on air. “Let&#039;s see what else there is – oh my gosh you look so <i>cute!</i>”</p><p class="double">“What?” Trixie&#039;s heart sank. If it was the...</p><p class="double">It was.</p><p class="double">At some point in the past, Twilight had had a loop where she was an alicorn, and Trixie was her baby sister – also an alicorn.</p><p class="double">The photos had formed material for a semi-serious joking blackmail for many, many loops, until Trixie had finally secured the last one. But it was <i>so</i> cute, she hadn&#039;t had the heart to destroy it – so into her private collection it had gone.</p><p class="double">She was regretting that, with hindsight.</p><p class="double">Still grinning like a loon, Chrysalis turned over another page. “Who&#039;s this?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that&#039;s Pony Stark. He and I had some fun times together...” Trixie smiled wistfully. “Before I met you, I hasten to say. But that pony could really party hard.”</p><p class="double">“I see.”</p><p class="double">Over the next half hour or so, an impromptu reminiscence session built up. Chrysalis went back to the start of the album and began to work through picture by picture, and Trixie explained the origin and meaning of each of the photographs. Some of them were gifts, including one that had the magical aura of an intense stasis spell which Twilight had taken the very first time Trixie had looped.</p><p class="double">Rather inevitably, the picture had a massive explosion as backdrop. (Perhaps less inevitably, the explosion seemed to be consuming Sombra&#039;s castle.)</p><p class="double">Eventually they reached the last few pages, which showed more familiar times. The first group photo with Chrysalis included, something which seemed to have come from a camera hidden in Pinkie Pie&#039;s mane – the two of them on an early date – and that time they&#039;d both been psionicists on Oerth.</p><p class="double">The very last picture, though, was different.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis stared at it for several seconds, mouth agape. “What.”</p><p class="double">“Ah. Er...” Trixie blinked. “Whoah. Forgot about that one.”</p><p class="double">“What is in this picture?” Chrysalis asked, absently.</p><p class="double">“That would be you as Rita Repulsa, Sombra as Lord Zedd, and me as an evil Pony Ranger,” Trixie supplied. “Twilight told me about this variant, see, and I asked for a photo of me in the evil-pony-ranger get up next time she had it.”</p><p class="double">“Am I <i>married to Sombra?”</i></p><p class="double">Trixie facehoofed. “Sure, focus on the fact they happen to be behind me... It&#039;s not like it was the only time that happened!”</p><p class="double">As soon as she&#039;d said this, Trixie Lulamoon realized it had been a strategic error.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why did I keep being married to Sombra?” Chrysalis asked, for the twelfth time.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t know, okay?” Trixie almost snapped. “Look, we&#039;re here now.”</p><p class="double">She knocked. After a few seconds, Cadence opened the door.</p><p class="double">“Hello, Trixie – ah. Chrysalis, I assume?”</p><p class="double">The jet-black pegasus nodded curtly. “Yes.”</p><p class="double">“There&#039;s something we&#039;d like to ask, you see...” Trixie hedged. “Can we come in?”</p><p class="double">“By all means.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I think I understand,” Cadence said finally. “You want to know why it was that, on these many occasions – I discussed it with Twilight back when you first awakened, Chrysalis, and I&#039;m afraid it is &#039;many&#039; – you were paired with the same pony.”</p><p class="double">“And, more to the point, a pony who is <i>evil,</i>” Chrysalis said. “And... not Trixie, really.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Cadence fumbled in her subspace pocket for a few seconds. “Right, I think I may be able to answer your question.”</p><p class="double">The object she produced was like a disassembled orrery, made of hundreds of metallic balls and rings, and as she started pushing magic into it the components levitated into the air.</p><p class="double">“Wait...” Trixie looked apprehensive. “Isn&#039;t this the Dating Simulator?”</p><p class="double">“The mark five,” Cadence nodded. “Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s mostly debugged – I fixed the valve problem, and it usually doesn&#039;t go prompt-critical anymore.” With those perhaps less than reassuring words, she began tapping the floating rings to arrange them into new shapes.</p><p class="double">“Should we run?” Chrysalis asked, sotto voce.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t think it would help,” Trixie replied candidly. “We might set it off.”</p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s see...” Cadence whistled to herself as she worked – a modified form of <i>John Wellington-Welles.</i> “Baseline Chrysalis, baseline Sombra... and go!”</p><p class="double">Lightning crackled, and something went <i>parp</i>. A sphere flashed blue, then green, and another went deep black.</p><p class="double">“Ah, there we go. Your baseline self and Sombra are indeed quite compatible, as ponies who have never met go.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis winced. “What about... me now?”</p><p class="double">“Chryssy...” Trixie said quietly.</p><p class="double">“No, I want to know.”</p><p class="double">Cadence entered the new question. The thing which went <i>parp</i>, once again, went <i>parp.</i> A beam of light flashed over Chrysalis&#039; form, making her jump, then the spheres changed colour again.</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Cadence examined a pattern of spheres hovering in front of her. “You&#039;re less compatible than with Blueblood.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis let out a relieved sigh.</p><p class="double">“As for you two...” Cadence tapped a few more spheres, tapped one again, then kicked it. It bounced off the wall, emitted a cloud of smoke, and exploded.</p><p class="double">A new one flew into place to replace it, and the thing went <i>parp</i>. Again.</p><p class="double">At Trixie&#039;s raised eyebrow, Cadence blushed. “You just can&#039;t get the parts these loops. Anyway-”</p><p class="double">A beam of light hit Trixie, this time. Then half the array went pink.</p><p class="double">“Huh. Well, that&#039;s a good sign,” Cadence said with finality. “Congratulations, and have you reconsidered the marriage thing?”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re fine without, thanks,” Trixie reiterated.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis seemed to be mulling something over. “So... why didn&#039;t you set me and Sombra up?”</p><p class="double">Cadence took her own time to think about that. “I might have done,” she said eventually. “But the first few loops, there was still that spectre of how nasty Sombra was in the slave-world loop. I mean, when you two are – or were – together, it was usually when you – and he in particular – were much less... well, evil. You were <i>villains</i>, but not evil for the sake of evil.”</p><p class="double">“I understand the distinction,” Chrysalis said.</p><p class="double">“Right. And when I was starting to think about it, Twilight took me aside and pointed a few things out to me.” Cadence sighed. “It was quite an effort of will, I must admit, to avoid getting involved – if only to keep you away from Shining. But Twilight told me that a real romance – especially for a looper – has to grow naturally. I&#039;ve not always remembered that,” she admitted, wincing. “But it was certainly the right thing to do here.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll say,” Trixie said softly, nuzzling the changeling queen.</p><p class="double">“One question.” Chrysalis pointed. “Shouldn&#039;t you turn that off?”</p><p class="double">Cadence followed her hoof, to see that the Simulator rings were revolving around one another faster and faster. The thing which went <i>parp</i> broke with tradition and went <i>sproing.</i></p><p class="double">“Oh dear...” Cadence sighed. “Everypony down!”</p><p class="double">Something loud happened.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Feel better now?” Trixie asked, later that night.</p><p class="double">“A little.” Chrysalis shook her head, her mane drifting in the breeze. “It&#039;s still strange to contemplate, though.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I know.”</p><p class="double">They looked down at the ring-festooned towers of Canterlot castle.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s nice to be able to have a fly once in a while,” Trixie ventured, trimming her pegasus wings against the currents. “Hey, maybe one of these days I&#039;ll borrow a photo from that time the normal Element bearers accidentally got married to Blueblood.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis blinked. “What, all of them?”</p><p class="double">Nod.</p><p class="double">“Who has a photo of <i>that?</i>”</p><p class="double">Trixie grinned. “Angel Bunny. That lapine has quite the nose for embarassing moments...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.2</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You saved my life,” Spike said dumbly, blinking as the huge Timber Wolf ran off.</p><p class="double">Applejack shrugged. “Aw, shucks, weren&#039;t nothing.”</p><p class="double">“And according to the dragon code of honour, that means that you&#039;re my servant,” Spike continued.</p><p class="double">“Now, ah don&#039;t want- what.” The earth pony frowned suddenly. “That don&#039;t sound right.”</p><p class="double">Innocently, Spike held up a tablet. “It&#039;s all here, in gneiss and granite.”</p><p class="double">Applejack snatched it from him, and read the exquisitely formed words, her lips moving. “Well, don&#039;t that beat all. It really does say that.”</p><p class="double">“So,” Spike said, rubbing his claws together. “I&#039;ve wanted to have someone else do the chores Twilight sets for years. At last! Free time!”</p><p class="double">Applejack grimaced. “Spike-”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a matter of honour, AJ,” Spike said earnestly.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That was just cruel, Spike,” Twilight admonished.</p><p class="double">Spike picked his teeth, sweeping his other hand in a grand gesture. “Yeah, but this way I think we can get a lesson out of it about not having to follow someone else&#039;s code of honour. Besides, I&#039;m not just lazing around...”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, her gaze sweeping the freshly ploughed field – the third of the day. “Are you sure using the Force for this is within the Jedi code?”</p><p class="double">He shrugged. “It&#039;s probably fine. Hey, can you keep her busy until after dark? I want the whole &#039;did a year&#039;s farm work in a week&#039; to stay secret for a bit longer...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.3</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, that went about as well as could be expected,” Twilight noted with a sigh.</p><p class="double">On the island disappearing behind the <i>Jack of All Trades</i> as it rose into the sky, the volcanic eruption seemed to be <i>really</i> getting going.</p><p class="double">“How did you pull this off, exactly?” she added, giving the visitors a look.</p><p class="double">“I said I was sorry,” Shade Slayer mumbled rebelliously. The blue dragon next to him rolled her eyes.</p><p class="double">“Okay,” Saphira began, taking a deep breath. “First off, we had a bit of a bad few loops. That&#039;s why we wanted this holiday.”</p><p class="double">“I understand the feeling,” Twilight nodded, and her voice softened. “And it was fun, the first week or so. But...”</p><p class="double">She pointed back at the volcano. With a muted <i>whump</i>, the airship captain engaged superheat, pulling them higher and further from the danger zone.</p><p class="double">“Right. This is going to sound ridiculous.” Saphira blushed. “You know that brewer pony?”</p><p class="double">“Berry Punch, yes,” Twilight confirmed. “What of her?”</p><p class="double">“She brewed us something which, in her own words, &#039;had a bit of kick to it&#039;.”</p><p class="double">Twilight got a sinking feeling.</p><p class="double">“We each got a glass, downed them, and then for some reason this twit here decided it might be interesting to see if he could make a volcano erupt.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Never</i> say <i>Brisingir</i> too loudly,” Eragon informed them.</p><p class="double">“Why didn&#039;t you stop him?” Twilight asked reasonably.</p><p class="double">The blue dragon blushed deeper. “I was too busy examining my own claws in minute detail.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight nodded. “Well, fortunately I managed to teleport us all up to the airship in time – well, except Spike and Celestia.”</p><p class="double">She pointed at the most recently forming pyroclastic flow. Two shapes, one purple and one white, could be faintly seen atop it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“This is fun!” Celestia announced, the sound of rocks on her tungsten-carbide surf board sounding like hail on a roof.</p><p class="double">Spike chuckled, his own durasteel board shimmering with magic.</p><p class="double">Rarity had made it for him, then shrunk it down with her signature spell so it looked like a handkerchief. (It was always best to be prepared.)</p><p class="double">“Uh... hey, Celestia?” he asked suddenly, seeing where they were headed. “What happens when a pyroclastic flow goes over water?”</p><p class="double">The alicorn grinned at him, as they reached the shoreline-</p><p class="double">-and the cloud of ash kept going.</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Spike looked down, as it gradually settled out and deposited him on the water itself. “That&#039;s kind of cool.”</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s hooves began to glow with a water walking effect. She picked her surfboard up, then did a running takeoff. “Come on! I&#039;m going to see if I can hover in the main jet!”</p><p class="double">“Sounds cool.” Spike spread his own wings and beat steadily at the air. “I guess what ruins one pony&#039;s holiday can just mean the most exciting bit for another...”</p><p class="double">“Can I have that in writing?” Celestia asked. “It sounds like another good lesson for the archive.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.4</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo materialized in a field three feet above the ground. Trying to spread her wings failed, because she was wearing barding, and she hit the ground with a <i>thud.</i></p><p class="double">“What th&#039; hell?” a female voice asked. “This is ridiculous!”</p><p class="double">“Righ back atcha, lady...” Scootaloo muttered, struggling upright.</p><p class="double">“I was trying to summon Cú Culain!” The woman pointed, apparently lost for words. “Not... a tiny little horse!”</p><p class="double">“Seriously, watch your mouth,” Scootaloo advised. She looked back along her own body, and after a moment&#039;s work managed to get her wings into the – awkwardly placed – slots for them. “Who designed this armour, it sucks...”</p><p class="double">“Oh. A pegasus. Great...” The woman sat down heavily. “Okay, so apparently I&#039;ve screwed up <i>so</i> badly. What Class are you? Or are you the horse and I&#039;m the Rider, or something?”</p><p class="double">“No idea what you&#039;re talking about.” Scootaloo tried an awkward smile. “Look, I&#039;ve got no idea where I am, as far as I&#039;m concerned I just <i>appeared</i> out of nowhere and now you&#039;re telling me I should be a Cullen or something.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, for... Right. Let&#039;s start over.” The woman extended a hand. “Hi. I&#039;m Bazett Fraga McRemitz, Magus”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo extended a forehoof, and contrived to make Bazett shake it. (Most of the Equestrians had &#039;interacting with bipeds&#039; at graduate level.) “Scootaloo&#039;s my name, and speed&#039;s my game!”</p><p class="double">Bazett just looked at her wierdly, then shrugged. “Oh, whatever. Okay, here&#039;s what&#039;s going on. This is what&#039;s called the Grail War, and I was trying to summon an ancient Celtic hero to fight for a great prize. He would have appeared as either Lancer or Caster, if I got it right, but apparently I didn&#039;t.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, is Lancer one of those classes you mentioned?” Bazett nodded. “Cool. That I can do.”</p><p class="double">The woman looked skeptical.</p><p class="double">She slipped Pansy out of her Pocket. Bazett took that in stride, which was interesting...</p><p class="double"><i>Okay,</i> she subvocalized. <i>Let&#039;s show off a bit.</i></p><p class="double">Pansy&#039;s mental contact was questioning for a moment, then approving. A faint mist oozed from the Device.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo let her cloud-crafting connect with it, shaping it into her standard weapon as Bronze Wing – a ten-foot <i>dory </i>with a broad leaf blade on the fore edge, and a hardened mace-like counterweight on the reverse. Grinning, she flipped it in a few precise circles, passing it from hoof to wing to a quick spin held by momentum to her neck, then gripped it in her mouth to toss it skywards and jumped after it with a flash of feathers.</p><p class="double">Sticking the point in the ground, she slid smoothly down the polished &#039;wood&#039; making up the shaft, then landed with a flourish. The <i>dory</i> burst into cloud behind her, and reformed across her back.</p><p class="double">Bazett blinked. “Okay, so maybe you <i>are</i> a Lancer.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, what the hell?” Bazett asked, looking out over Fuyuki in disbelief. “Has the whole setup changed and I didn&#039;t notice?</p><p class="double">Scootaloo shrugged. “Hey, I&#039;m feeling a lot more at home now than I was yesterday.”</p><p class="double">Caster and Archer, both unicorns, blazed magic back and forth between them. The Caster was using a balanced mix of defensive spells and standard-issue offensive spellfire, all in her signature colour of purple, while Archer seemed to be relying on a stream of fire spells, high explosives and illusions.</p><p class="double">Overhead, Rider soared above the city on her huge purple-and-green dragon.</p><p class="double">“Hi!” Scootaloo shouted. “Spike! Down here!”</p><p class="double">Bazett jerked. “What? Don&#039;t-”</p><p class="double">With a <i>slam</i> of air, the Wyrm landed in front of them.</p><p class="double">“Hello, darling!” Rarity called from atop Spike&#039;s neck. “Most of the humans here are such beasts – we&#039;re planning something. Is yours alright?”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo glanced at Bazett. “Yeah, she seems cool enough.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Rarity tapped Spike&#039;s neck. “Come along, dear.”</p><p class="double">“Who&#039;s driving again?” Spike rumbled good-naturedly, spreading his wings.</p><p class="double">“You are, dear, I&#039;m just map reading.”</p><p class="double">Ignoring Bazett&#039;s incredulous stare as Rider took to the air again, Scootaloo shaded her eyes for a look around. <i>Wonder who else is here. Ooh, Gilda is Saber. I&#039;ll have to take the opportunity for a spar...</i></p><p class="double">A custard pie hit Scootaloo in the cheek.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie materialized from thin air, and held up a card. <b>The Mime Assassin strikes again!</b></p><p class="double">Scootaloo wiped her face clean. “Seriously? Are you Assassin?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie turned her card over. <b>Yep!</b> Then she turned it over again. <b>Pity Sweetie isn&#039;t here, I could do with some piano music accompaniment.</b></p><p class="double">“Wait,” Bazett said, pointing. “Did that card just-”</p><p class="double">Pinkie turned it over again. <b>Sure did!</b></p><p class="double">Scootaloo whirled a small sling around her tail for a moment, then launched the slingstone at Pinkie&#039;s ear. With lightning speed, the pink party pony dropped the card, and held up her hooves as if against an invisible wall.</p><p class="double">The <i>clank</i> of the slingstone hitting an invisible wall indicated that she&#039;d had a good reason for that.</p><p class="double">“Cool,” Scootaloo pronounced. “I did wonder.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie picked up the card again. <b>Don&#039;t make me mime a big hammer :)</b></p><p class="double">Bazett threw up her hands. “I give up.”</p><p class="double">“Wait a sec...” Scootaloo frowned. “Who&#039;s Berserker?”</p><p class="double">A howl filled the air over Fuyuki. Then a very large, pastel yellow wolf lumbered into a nearby park and started digging a hole, tail wagging.</p><p class="double">“Right.” The pegasus nodded to herself. “Mental note, don&#039;t annoy Fluttershy this loop, in case she goes all you-will-love-me.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie had taken the opportunity to disappear again. Scootaloo could just make out a hail of blueberry pies materializing from nowhere, and landing on Gilda.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Miles away, Princess Celestia sat on her haunches in the middle of a well-appointed apartment building. “In all honesty, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll bother getting involved. Wonder what&#039;s on TV?”</p><p class="double">A remote clicked.</p><p class="double">“Ooh, a cooking channel!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia walked into the room her scrying told her that her sister had been subdued. “Well done, Twilight, and-”</p><p class="double">She paused.</p><p class="double">“Twilight? Why are you all alicorns?”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked down at herself with a frown, then gasped. “Oh! Sorry, Princess, I forgot you weren&#039;t here for that bit. When I got the Elements working, their power flowed into us and made us like this!”</p><p class="double">“I must admit,” the Princess said, “I did not expect this...”</p><p class="double">“Hold on.” Twilight muttered something, and with a flash of purple light her wings disappeared. “There we go.”</p><p class="double">“What did you just say?” Celestia asked, noting that the Element of Magic had a gradually dimming light emanating from the capstone.</p><p class="double">“Oh, well...” Twilight blushed. “It was kind of a guess actually. You see, when I said &#039;harmony power, make up&#039; it transformed me, so I said the same thing again and it seems to have worked.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Celestia considered that, then concluded that – well, it wasn&#039;t exactly beyond the realm of possibility that her student (along with her new friends) had discovered some deeper form of magic from the elements that had eluded Luna and herself.</p><p class="double">“Well done, then, Twilight. Are your friends alright?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled at the word <i>friends</i>, then looked back at the five unconscious alicorns behind her. “I hope so...”</p><p class="double">“Excellent. Now, I must deal with my sister.”</p><p class="double">“I knew it!” Twilight grinned. “I knew you had to be one of the sisters from the story! And... Princess... Luna, is the other?”</p><p class="double">“That is correct.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight,” Celestia said, a smile on her face. “I appreciate the enormous potency and utility of this new ability you have discovered in the Elements-”</p><p class="double">“Flying is pretty amazing,” Twilight interjected, with a blissful expression on her face. “I&#039;d almost trade magic for it.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, well.” Celestia coughed. “You see, the problem is that you and your friends are getting... well, a little overly eager to rely on this ability.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not sure I follow.”</p><p class="double">Celestia sighed. “Twilight, your friend Applejack used her alicorn abilities to gather in the harvest.”</p><p class="double">“That seems fine to me,” Twilight said, puzzled.</p><p class="double">“Your friend Rarity used it to show off at the Young Fliers&#039; competition.”</p><p class="double">“Well, she had those new dress designs to market... the ones made out of rainbow and cloud.” Twilight shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy used her Element to turn into an alicorn to get over a gap smaller than her own body length,” Celestia continued.</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s afraid of heights,” Twilight defended. “It makes her feel more comfortable.”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s already a pegasus!” Celestia massaged her forehead. “Sorry, that outburst was impolite of me. But when your friends are becoming alicorns to solve even the slightest problem, then it seems as though it would be simpler to just... transform permanently.”</p><p class="double">Twilight gaped. “But we can&#039;t become alicorns <i>permanently</i>, Princess! I mean... we&#039;d be Princesses as well! We don&#039;t want to displace you or cheapen your office...”</p><p class="double">“Twilight, you turned into an alicorn to fly up one floor of your own house. At this point, you&#039;re using ascension to save on walking.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn (well, currently one, anyway) shrugged. “I don&#039;t see the problem.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“How&#039;s it going?” Dash asked, giggling.</p><p class="double">“Well, she had a talk with me about it,” Twilight replied, chuckling herself.</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned. “Nearly there! What should we do next?”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought for a bit. “What about doing it so we don&#039;t have to move the pieces in a game of chess?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.6</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Momma?” Nyx asked, face scrunched up in confusion. “Can I ask you a question?”</p><p class="double">“Of course – and no, that wasn&#039;t the answer.” Twilight trotted over. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“Well... you know how I&#039;m your daughter this time, right? I mean, uh, biological?”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, suppressing a slight wince. She&#039;d <i>never</i> get used to loops like that...</p><p class="double">“Well... I feel like it&#039;s <i>better</i> than if you adopted me, but I don&#039;t know <i>why</i> I feel that, and I&#039;m not sure if feeling like that is alright, either.” The filly-corn shrugged helplessly.</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled. “Nyx, I love you. And that&#039;s the same whether you&#039;re a biological foal of mine, or a filly I adopted, or even a fully grown mare. Or, er, stallion.”</p><p class="double">They both remembered the time she&#039;d been Noctis, with matching shudders. That had been <i>strange.</i></p><p class="double">“But... yes, there&#039;s no difference in my mind.” Twilight frowned, then, and waved a hoof. “Well, there shouldn&#039;t be. But candour compels me to admit there might be a slight difference... in any case, it&#039;s nothing significant, and it <i>shouldn&#039;t be</i>. A daughter is a daughter is a daughter. And what you <i>do</i> is what matters.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked contemplative for a bit, then nodded. “Right. Like how you treated us when we were all your daughters, when you were Queen Twilight.”</p><p class="double">“Exactly. The difference is about <i>you</i>, not where you came from. I know that&#039;s not always how it works out in the real world, but it should be.”</p><p class="double">After digesting that, Nyx nodded again. “Right. Thanks.”</p><p class="double">“No problem.” Twilight nuzzled Nyx. “And – hey, if I make a mistake, tell me, okay? It&#039;s not as if there are university courses in this.”</p><p class="double">She looked annoyed for a moment. “And when there <i>are</i>, they don&#039;t let me in without asking some <i>very</i> embarrassing questions...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.7</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, this is a right ballyhoo,” a tan stallion wearing a scarf said. “Ginger? Algy? Any of you around?”</p><p class="double">There was no reply for a few seconds, then an orange head poked out of the nearby Anderson hut.</p><p class="double">“Hello?” the filly thus revealed said. “Are you looking for... someone... wait a minute!”</p><p class="double">There was a blur of motion, and she grabbed his front hoof in both her own hooves. “Are you James Bigglesworth?”</p><p class="double">“Well, Jams, apparently, but you have the advantage of me.” Biggles allowed his hoof to be shaken. “You seem a little familiar from somewhere, but I&#039;m deuced if I know where from.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Scootaloo,” the filly said, and grinned. “You <i>should</i> remember me, at least if you&#039;re looping. But it was a long time ago... we crashed a prototype aircraft into a lake?”</p><p class="double">“I do seem to recall something along those lines once,” Biggles confirmed. “I&#039;d thought it was all some kind of mystic shared hallucination, but I must admit that we&#039;ve learned more about what&#039;s actually science since then and shared hallucinations are no more than a particularly unusual superstition back...” The pilot gestured behind himself, trying to convey a sense of the direction of a different universe.</p><p class="double">It didn&#039;t work.</p><p class="double">“Back wherever,” he finished, giving up the attempt.</p><p class="double">“I see.” Scootaloo nodded. “Yep, that was us. Actually, not all that long ago I had a loop where I replaced you -brilliant fun. We cancelled World War Two and were flying Meteors by 1930.”</p><p class="double">“Do you know, that&#039;s not far off my record?” Biggles sat back somewhat awkwardly. “The best piece of work I&#039;ve managed thus far is probably to make a dashed <i>huge</i> pile of money on speculation, and then use it all to support some of the best aviation development experts of our time. I can get the War down to an abortive campaign over Czechoslovakia in 1938, if it all goes according to plan.”</p><p class="double">“Cool.” Scootaloo looked like she wanted to ask a thousand questions, but visibly held them in. “Okay, based on loop memories and stuff I seem to be your assistant and protégé. Which is <i>so cool</i>, by the way...”</p><p class="double">“Right, right.” Biggles glanced over at the three aircraft lined up neatly on the airstrip - a de Havilland Mosquito, a Fairey Swordfish, and a Heinkel He-162 Salamander. All three bore the marks of heavy customization. “My own local memories tell me we&#039;re supposed to be archaeologists who operate by plane, trying to discover some kind of ancient civilization in the local islands.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo nodded. “Makes sense – I&#039;d be <i>very</i> surprised if the two of us were doing a loop which didn&#039;t involve planes in some way. I assume you&#039;re an Anchor?”</p><p class="double">“I am, that&#039;s correct.” Biggles pointed at the planes. “Any preference?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll take whichever of the Mossie and the Stringbag you don&#039;t want,” she replied. “I know they&#039;re two-seater, but I <i>really</i> want to do as much flying as you.”</p><p class="double">“Lass after my own heart.” Biggles trotted briskly over to the Salamander, and kicked it viciously – producing a loud <i>crunch</i> noise. “Piece of Fritz junk anyway. Right, I&#039;m for the Mossie.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo galloped up and jumped into the cockpit of the Swordfish, a flap of her wings helping her make the cockpit. “This is gonna be <i>so cool!</i>”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Is it me, or do these islands want to kill us?”</p><p class="double">“Wouldn&#039;t surprise me in the slightest, miss Cooper.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo facehoofed, then put both hooves firmly back on the stick and banked hard right. “I told you, I only had that name once. Anyway, you see my point, right? I mean, there was the fuel leak...”</p><p class="double">“I must admit, that was the first time I&#039;ve had to perform in-flight refuelling from a train,” Biggles mused. “Fiddly business.”</p><p class="double">“I get why the aircraft carrier landing was pretty near impossible for you,” she continued. “I mean, the Mossie was never really navalized. But I&#039;m in a Stringbag! And it still had trouble!”</p><p class="double">“Well – whoops!”</p><p class="double">Biggles and Scootaloo both slammed their respective aircraft into turns so severe they nearly flipped upside down, narrowly avoiding an avalanche of rocks falling from a nearby cliff wall.</p><p class="double">“This is just ridiculous,” Scootaloo opined, as a lightning strike brought down a cascade of yet more rocks. “And as for that map we found-”</p><p class="double">“I know. I&#039;m not exactly relishing the idea of flying over an active volcano either...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.8 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;The spell! Perform your spell!&quot; Twilight shouted to a bedraggled Cadence and now un-hypnotized Shining Armor.</p><p class="double">&quot;What good would that do? My changelings already roam free!&quot; cried the Changeling Queen Chrysalis.</p><p class="double">&quot;No!&quot; cried Shining as he attempted to cast it, with only a few sparks emanating from his horn as the result. &quot;I don&#039;t have the strength to repel them.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence put her hoof around Shining. &quot;My love will give you strength.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What good will love do? Its an absolutely ridiculous sentiment.&quot; snarked the Changeling Queen.</p><p class="double">In response, Shining and Cadence touched horns, an aura glowing around the couple. A blast of pure weaponized love rocked the Queen and sent her careening into a nearby column. The rest of the changelings were blast out of Canterlot and the invasion was ended.</p><p class="double">Where the Changeling Queen had landed, something unusual happened. Her head released a couple of gouts of steam and it split open to reveal two white mice.</p><p class="double">Cadence blinked at the pair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mice? What? Why?&quot; asked Shining.</p><p class="double">&quot;We are two lab mice and this is..was part of an elaborate sceme to take over Equestria!&quot; said the shorter of the two in a surprisingly deep voice, paws clasped together behind his back.</p><p class="double">&quot;Narf!&quot; was the single reply of the taller one.</p><p class="double">&quot;And they&#039;ve been very naughty!&quot; cried Fluttershy, as Twilight&#039;s ponykinesis enveloped the pair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well its back to Fluttershy&#039;s cottage. We have to plan for tomorrow night.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why? What are we going to do tomorrow night?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The same thing we do every night, Pinkie. Try and take over Equestria!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.9 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Two armies stood in full array, lined up across from one another on an open meadow. To the north stood a single rank of white unicorns and pegasi, all clad in shining golden armor. To the south stood a much less orderly mob... say rather swarm, of black creatures whose appearance owed as much to insect as to equine.</p><p class="double">In between the lines two larger figures stood facing one another. An alicorn pony with a bright red coat and an ethereal mane that turned from deep blue at the roots to a starfield towards its fringes; this was Prince Optimist, Lord of the Sunrise. A dark, dour changeling warrior, half again as tall as the others, wearing an old-fashioned bucket-style helmet over his crooked horn; this was King Megaptera, Master of Deception.</p><p class="double">Loudly enough that both sides could hear, Megaptera shouted, &quot;My people are starving, Prince Optimist. I have struggled to conquer your kingdom in the past, but we no longer have the energy to continue the battle. I therefore...&quot; The next word choked in his throat for several seconds before he could get it out. &quot;I therefore surrender my crown and abdicate my rule, on the condition that you will accept my changelings as citizens under your rule. They deserve a chance to find those who will give freely the love we could not take by force.&quot;</p><p class="double">Prince Optimist considered this carefully before saying, just as loudly as Megaptera, &quot;I believe freedom and harmony to be the right of all thinking creatures, Megaptera. However, I cannot ignore the fact that changelings have tried to trick the ponies of Equestria in the past. What surety do we have that this is not another trick?&quot;</p><p class="double">Megaptera leaned forward and hissed quietly, &quot;Prime, I am TRYING to play NICE this Loop. And it does NOT. COME. NATURALLY!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There are satisfactions to be had outside of battle,&quot; Optimist replied quietly. &quot;For example-&quot;</p><p class="double">Two flashes of green magic flickered out from the Equestrian side of the field of parley, striking both Prince Optimist and Megaptera. The two leaders went down instantly.</p><p class="double">One of the Equestrian guards stepped out of the ranks, flying into the air as its disguise fell to reveal another changeling warrior. &quot;The leaders of Equestria have fallen!&quot; it crowed. &quot;Now none stand to defy the rule of Screaming Star the mighty! Bow down and worship your new leader!&quot;</p><p class="double">Despite this stunning display of leadership, charisma and humility, not a single pony or changeling bent a knee.</p><p class="double">From where they lay on the grass, the two slightly bruised rulers looked at one another.</p><p class="double">&quot;Screaming Star?&quot; Optimist asked.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Starscream?&quot;</i> Megaptera&#039;s eyes only remained wide for a moment before they narrowed. A most vicious grin spread across the black muzzle. &quot;And I thought today was going to be boring. Or would you rather do the honors?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;By all means,&quot; Optimist said, &quot;feel free to enjoy-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AW YEAH!&quot; a female voice said from behind the line of Equestrian guards. A blue pegasus soared up into the air. &quot;Looks like SOMEPONY just asked for a REMATCH.&quot;</p><p class="double">Megaptera&#039;s eyes widened again. &quot;Is that a rainbow mane?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she the one that-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is she Awake?&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Yes.&quot; </b>Said with extreme satisfaction.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well.&quot; Megaptera pulled himself to a seated position. &quot;On second thought, there are indeed satisfactions to be had outside of battle.&quot; Craning his neck, he shouted up, &quot;By all means, carry on, <i>my lord</i> Screaming Star!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, actually,&quot; Screaming Star hissed, flapping backwards to put distance between himself and the approaching Rainbow Dash, &quot;I was wondering if it was too late to apply for a position as-&quot;</p><p class="double">At that point Rainbow Dash tackled the would-be changeling lord in midair, and for several minutes to follow Screaming Star lived up to his pony name. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.10 (Anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was supposed to be a simple Loop, following the baseline for the most part. Twilight had thought she could use the familiar, relaxing routine before the next loop expansion, which Twilight figured ought to happen any Loop now.</p><p class="double">That plan was slightly derailed when it turned out that the ancient tyrant that Celestia and Luna had used the Elements to imprison in stone was Queen Chrysalis. Fortunately, when she broke free, she turned out to be Awake, and the whole scenario played out in good fun with a happy ending for all concerned, although not without Twilight being forced to explain the Loops to this version of Celestia. (She used her Explaining The Loops To Celestia Conversation Pattern Three, as that one worked best to ease the Princess into accepting somepony who was usually villainous as an ally and friend.)</p><p class="double">She <i>really</i> should have considered the implication for the upcoming Royal Wedding, but she&#039;d been having too much fun planning to be dubious that Shining was good enough for Cadance.</p><p class="double">“Is there anything you can do, my faithful... Twilight?” Celestia finished awkwardly, giving the purple usually-unicorn&#039;s newly sprouted wings a nervous look.</p><p class="double">Twilight didn&#039;t answer the question, instead staring out from the heavily warded castle balcony over the city of Canterlot. She winced once as the Lower South Terrace neighborhood became the Widdershins Hovering Warm Milk Lake. A moment later, the east side of the city started experiencing time in reverse, if Twilight judged the magical pulse correctly.</p><p class="double">“Twilight?” Celestia asked again nervously.</p><p class="double">“...first, I&#039;m going to check the old mines,” Twilight said, “and hope that he stashed the real Cadance down there like normal.”</p><p class="double">“Normal... you mean something like this happens <i>every</i> time?” Celestia&#039;s voice was horrified, and Twilight reminded herself that with the altered history this was completely new to her. There was a bright light, and then one of the castle towers to their left was inside out. “Or is he... Awake?”</p><p class="double">“With him, sometimes I can hardly tell,” Twilight groused. She took a breath. “Anyway, once I&#039;ve found Cadance, we can evacuate.”</p><p class="double">“Evacuate the city?” Celestia seemed about to protest. Then what looked to be a particularly unpleasant section of the Everfree replaced the castle gardens below their balcony, black tentacle-vines ensnaring everypony within... and then politely depositing them at the front gates. Although from the confusion occurring there, clearly something else had been done to them in the interim. “All right,” Celestia said after a silent moment. “That sounds like a good idea.”</p><p class="double">“No, not the city,” Twilight said. “We&#039;re going to evacuate Equestria.”</p><p class="double">“<i>What</i>?” Celestia exclaimed, her voice strangled. “You can&#039;t possibly be serious.”</p><p class="double">“I am absolutely serious,” Twilight answered, her horn glowing as she prepared to teleport down the mines. She took one last glance at the city and the army attacking it.</p><p class="double">Thousands of miniature draconequi darted througout the city, spreading chaos and terror in their wake. In the center of it all, Discord lounged on his throne (suspended upside down from a cotton candy cloud, of course). As though noticing Twilight&#039;s attention, he winked, before snapping his fingers.</p><p class="double">Twilight had a moment of disorientation as her perspective shifted a few feet up and to the right. She shook her head to clear it, strands of pastel, glowing mane passing across her eyes, and she sighed. She glanced down, and was not surprised to see &#039;herself&#039;. The teleportation spell she&#039;d been in the middle of charging fizzled out and the tiny-seeming purple alicorn started to panic.</p><p class="double">Twilight groaned slightly, raising a golden-shod hoof to her – or rather to <i>Celestia&#039;s</i> – face. “Princess Celestia?” Twilight asked the other alicorn, wincing slightly at the familiar-but-still-alien sound of her new voice.</p><p class="double">The &#039;Twilight Sparkle&#039; took a deep breath and looked up. “Is that you, Twilight?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Princess,” Twilight said. She started her teleport spell again, and was momentarily distracted by the golden glow of her horn. A small part of her mind started listing some interesting experiments to run before fixing this mess.</p><p class="double">“Where can we even evacuate <i>to</i>?” Celestia asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight risked another look at Discord, who was now surrounded by a swarm of what seemed to be pony-parasprite hybrids. “...I hear the moon is nice this time of the century.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.11 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Good evening, Twilight. Come in from the road.&quot; Zecora stepped aside to allow the princess to enter her hut. &quot;What brings you tonight to my humble abode?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Zecora,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;I don&#039;t know if I mentioned the new expansion to the Loop to you- you know, the one where Fluttershy discovers she enjoys being a singer so long as nobody can see her doing it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You might or might not have, but I do not mind it,&quot; Zecora smiled. &quot;Thanks to your friends, I have been reminded.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My friends?&quot; Twilight asked. &quot;But the pet center benefit isn&#039;t for another week yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity and Fluttershy wanted time to rehearse, so they came here to me for the poison joke curse.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Well, anyway, that&#039;s not why I came here. I figured that, if you can make poison joke trigger specific effects, you could reproduce other things besides the Flutterguy voice.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That is the truth which you have guessed, as your friend Pinkie Pie could attest.&quot;</p><p class="double">A pink head poked through one of Zecora&#039;s windows, preceded by a large swollen tongue covered in blue polka dots. Two blue eyes glared meaningfully at Zecora before withdrawing out the window once more.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... what?&quot; Twilight asked, pointing to the window.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie&#039;s thoughtless rambling last Loop caused quite the sensation; this karmic punishment your friends chose by acclamation.&quot;</p><p class="double">A pink hoof poked a sign through the window: GOODBYE TURKEY CALLING CHAMPIONSHIP!</p><p class="double">&quot;Um.... yeah,&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;Anyway, I wasn&#039;t asking that you do it to Pinkie.&quot;</p><p class="double">The sign flipped over. YOU&#039;RE NOT?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Why cain&#039;t ya just teleport on in thar an&#039; get youre stuff yerself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I warded my workshop against all teleportation,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;There are a lot of things I don&#039;t want unawake ponies to find! Can you imagine unawake Trixie building her own Intelligent Device? Or Scootaloo making a scooter out of repulsorlifts?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then why don&#039;tcha make yerself a set o&#039; lock-out keys?&quot; Appleteeny grumbled, hanging from the edge of the little ventilation pipe. &quot;Loops&#039; smartest pony can&#039;t think of that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Look, just hurry up, get down there, and unlock my doors!&quot; Twilight said. &quot;If I don&#039;t get all that stuff stowed in my pocket before the Loop ends, I&#039;ll lose everything! It&#039;ll take tens of thousands of Loops to replace some of it!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applebloom rushed up to Twilight. &quot;Hey, are y&#039;done with my sister yet, Twilight? I need her to unlock the access port fer my hangar! Scootaloo and Diamond Tiara wrecked the controls when they crash-landed in the south forty!&quot;</p><p class="double">The shrunken Applejack&#039;s grumblings were cut off when she lost her grip and slid screaming down the ventilation shaft. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.12 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke as a baby looking up at two adult humans. The lady picked her up gently.</p><p class="double">&quot;Martha, we can&#039;t just take an alien baby,&quot; the man said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes we can, if we hurry. Use the winch and load her spaceship in the truck. I&#039;ll cover it up with a tarp,&quot; the woman, Martha, looked at her husband pleadingly, &quot;This is the answer to our prayers, John. We can finally have a baby. I will call her Tara. Tara Kent.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, now Tara Kent, grew up in a loving family on a farm.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mom, Dad?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Tara?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know how there comes a point in every young girl&#039;s life when they find the alien spaceship that they arrived on Earth in?&quot;</p><p class="double">Stunned, Martha and John Kent didn&#039;t say anything.</p><p class="double">&quot;Because I totally found the spaceship that I came in. I also activated the AI with the personality of my birth father. Don&#039;t worry, he&#039;s very boring compared to you, Dad. We just talked about the technology of my destroyed homeworld. It gave me some good ideas for later.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Honey, I know we didn&#039;t tell you the truth,&quot; Martha started only to be interrupted by a hug from Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Mom, I understand completely. There&#039;s nothing to forgive. You two are my real family.&quot;</p><p class="double">Johnathan Kent got in on the hug, &quot;And you are our daughter no matter what.&quot;</p><p class="double">Tara smiled, &quot;That&#039;s great, because I wanted to ask..&quot;</p><p class="double">John spoke up, &quot;You&#039;re still not skipping ahead in school.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But it&#039;s so boring! And I have a super-smart alien brain.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tara, you need to learn social skills. Make some friends,&quot; Martha Kent said, reminding Twilight of a certain alicorn mentor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine, but there isn&#039;t that many interesting, I mean potential friends. Lana Lang and Chloe Sullivan are alright, but most other girls are just best ignored.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just try, okay?&quot; Twilight just nodded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Remembering what she could of the DC universe, Twilight couldn&#039;t help but let loose a tiny giggle. Superman&#039;s weaknesses included magic. The former magical unicorn pony from the magical land of Equestria, whose special talent was magic laughed to herself for a good long while when she remembered this fact. Her other weakness, kryptonite radiation, was fixed by creating a permanent skin-tight magical shield that reflected all said radiation away from her.</p><p class="double">&quot;So another altered human has been depowered?&quot; The spaceship&#039;s AI asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. I&#039;m getting pretty good at endowing and removing Kryptonite induced powers. Now that my adoptive parents now can take care of their farm with super speed and strength, I was thinking of taking Kryptonian technology to the next level.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you sure Earth can handle it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I did some magical divination to see what kind of future would happen if I did not do this. All the alien invasions, dimensional incursions, and superpowered villains. It would be a mess,&quot; Twilight reasoned.</p><p class="double">The AI was silent as minutes passed. Then it spoke, &quot;Very well, here are the schematics for the rest of our people&#039;s technologies.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The information download gave Twilight a massive headache and a massive smile. She knew how she could make it up to her birth family and people.</p><p class="double">Thus, the first thing she did after graduation was formed the Kent Technology corporation. Using every bit of her intelligence and lessons learned from her most business savvy friend, Rarity; Twilight managed to raise her company to the same level as Lex-Corp, Wayne Enterprises, and Oliver Queen&#039;s corporation in only a few years.</p><p class="double">The small green crystaline probe emerged from the Kent-Tech satellite that orbited the planet Venus. A few moments later, this was followed by a similar crystal. When all the kryptonian terraformer probes were in place, they activated. Hours later, the planet Venus was a perfect duplicate of Krypton.</p><p class="double">Time travel technology was forbidden by Kryptonian law. Twilight Sparkle reasoned that such a law can&#039;t exist until the Kryptonian people could enforce it. Thus the satellite in orbit linked up to a point in time right before the destruction of the original Krypton and a split second before their deaths all the doomed Kryptonians were saved. To live happily on Venus, a planet in orbit around Earth&#039;s very yellow sun.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Miss Kent! You&#039;ve brought a civilization of super powered aliens to our solar system,&quot; the news reporters were all over her during the press conference, &quot;How do you propose to protect Earth from even one of these unstoppable Kryptonians?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The answer is simple,&quot; Twilight answered, &quot;My company will be providing Kryptonian powers at very affordable prices to any human that wanted them, provided they didn&#039;t have a criminal history.&quot;</p><p class="double">It took a while for the pandemonium to quiet down.</p><p class="double">At least the politicians changed their stance on selling superpowers to people, Twilight thought. Partly because of our new planetary neighbors, and partly because they knew she could have taken her operation to tax-free international waters.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight smiled as she looked upon the list of the first subjects to the Kryptonian enhancement package. She paused at the name marked Bruce Wayne. It would be interesting to see how everything changed now.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A few years later, when the White Martians tried to invade Earth, they found billions of Super men and women alongside their Kryptonian allies. So it was that the base DC timeline was made completely and utterly unrecognizable. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">63.13 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">MLP Loop Trek: Evening Interludes</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Good Evening, Captain. Please come in,&quot; said Twilight Sparkle, greeting Rainbow Dash at the entrance to her quarters.</p><p class="double">The pegasus came in just far enough to let the doors close. &quot;Twilight, I think we need to talk about what&#039;s coming up further down the line.&quot; She seemed slightly ill-at-ease.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anything in particular? I&#039;ve distributed all the episode videos, the written summaries, and selected analyses to all of the looping crew.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah...About that. Just to state the blindingly obvious, you&#039;re in Spock&#039;s slot, and I&#039;ve gone over your official Starfleet personnel file...&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight started to get a sinking feeling. &quot;And I gather you&#039;ve been looking at the second season?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow nodded.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;I&#039;ve already been over this with Nyx for obvious reasons. Yes, I&#039;m half crystal pony in this continuity. And yes, I&#039;m betrothed. To Flash Sentry, if you must know. And no, there is no equivalent to Pon Farr for crystal ponies. So I don&#039;t think there is any reason for us to try to kill each other when my supposed wedding date comes up. Anything else?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;About your parents and the Babel conference...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance and Shining.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s...kinda weird.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not the first time for me we&#039;ve been parent and child -- In either direction. And I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;re both unawake. There&#039;s been plenty of time for them to send the signals, even if we&#039;re supposed to be estranged. Y&#039;know. I&#039;ve always wondered why baseline Spock&#039;s file didn&#039;t mention that he was Sarek&#039;s son...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy? Y&#039;all got a minute?&quot; asked Applejack, poking her head out of her sickbay office.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure, Applejack. What do you need?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s just Dash, Twi and me have been meanin&#039; to talk to ya about how little there&#039;s been for y&#039;all to do this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I honestly don&#039;t mind at all. You know me. I like quiet loops. It gives me time to work on my own projects.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re a little worried that ya don&#039;t have any animal friends to keep ya company, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. I do miss them, but please don&#039;t worry. I&#039;m fine. How are you feeling about all this?&quot; she asked, indicating sickbay and the ship around them with a wing gesture.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m a little out of my comfort zone; I&#039;ve done the &#039;country doctor&#039; thing a few times, but it ain&#039;t like with Apple Bloom, who&#039;s eatin&#039; up being Chief Engineer, or Scoots whose only disappointment is that she&#039;s flyin&#039; a big cruiser and not one of them <i>Defiant</i> class heavy escorts.&quot; Her expression suddenly brightened as a thought struck. &quot;Heh...Silly thing...I&#039;m still waitin&#039; on my chance to use the &#039;Darn, it Dash! I&#039;m a Doctor, not a whatever&#039; line.&quot; They both chuckled.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I do appreciate you three being concerned for me, but I&#039;m fine,&quot; Fluttershy reassured her friend.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay then. Just two more things.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;First off, we&#039;re probably gonna be encounterin&#039; tribbles a ways down the road. I hope that won&#039;t be a problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll do my best to control myself.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And second, we know you&#039;ve been practicin&#039; yer shape-shifting in the arboretum durin&#039; the night watch; Tiara&#039;s been gettin&#039; reports from spooked ponies.

It&#039;s just an earworm that tends to implant when I&#039;m in a Trek loop,&quot; explained Sweetie.</p><p class="double"><i>But you&#039;ve adapted it to our current circumstances.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m off duty. I&#039;m allowed to be silly.&quot; Sweetie collected her dandelion salad and went to the table where Apple Bloom, Nyx, and Silver Spoon were finishing their own meals. &quot;Hey, guys. I heard you&#039;ve completed your certification, Silver. Congrats.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thanks,&quot; said the dragoness, contemplating one last Beryl from the selection of gems she&#039;d ordered for dessert. &quot;You hear anything from the seniors about what&#039;s coming next?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nothing solid, but I&#039;ve been picking up rumors that an Ambassador Harshwhinny may be coming aboard sometime soon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nyx&#039;s expression went thoughtful. &quot;If I were to guess, that&#039;s probably the Eminian-Vendikan War. Joy. More society-controlling computers to blow up. Depending on how the Captain wants to play this, you may end up in command for a while, Apple Bloom.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great. I&#039;m still foal-sittin&#039; our own computer upgrades,&quot; muttered the Engineer.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have offered to help you monitor the situation,&quot; pointed out Cookie from her necklace. &quot;On several occasions.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Problem is, you, Clover, and Pansy aren&#039;t officially on the crew roster, so you can&#039;t stand watches or actually do much of anything without your &#039;sponsor&#039; physically present. Barrin&#039; Q or Discord jiggerin&#039; reality again, it&#039;ll take either me or Twilight and five minutes alone with a Starbase records computer to create proper identities for y&#039;all.

I might be able to rig up mobile holoemitters fer y&#039;all, or at the very least holographic disguises fer yer armor shell forms fer after.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Speaking of Pansy,&quot; mused Silver. &quot;Where&#039;s Scootaloo?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;all know that mini-holosuite I set up in cargo hold 3 yesterday?

Let&#039;s go. But I get the Death Star this time.&quot; Seeing the orange pegasus&#039; frown, she added, &quot;I don&#039;t see what you&#039;re so sad about, Miss Best Helmspony in Starfleet.

He couldn&#039;t quite tell if the panels were full of super-science gizmos or just random junk glued up and spray-painted over in gray.</p><p class="double">He looked at his hand, which currently held a screwdriver.

The thing in front of Discord, which he&#039;d taken for a kewpie-doll made out of parts from a gumball machine, moved to face him. &quot;I mean, what&#039;s the point of dismantling the vital guidance and control circuits from the satellite to build us if you were planning on going nuts anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not like I knew how to operate them anyway, I&#039;m just a janitor.&quot; Discord&#039;s eyes bulged as he realized what he&#039;d said. &quot;No. No, I am NOT going to play along with this Loop. I&#039;m going to snap my fingers and restore myself to delightful, delightful chaos.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who, chaos? Chaos from Mr. Minnesota himself? This I have to see!&quot; the gumball machine chortled.</p><p class="double">Discord snapped his fingers.</p><p class="double">After a brief pause he snapped them again.</p><p class="double">And again.</p><p class="double">He tried snapping the fingers of his left hand instead.</p><p class="double">He tried alternating.</p><p class="double">He tried simultaneous.</p><p class="double">And he kept on trying until the snapping built into a syncopated rhythm, then into a frantic metronome that ceased only when his fingertips grew chafed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, have you tried wiggling your nose, Samantha?&quot; the golden robot asked.</p><p class="double">Before Discord could ponder a witty rejoinder, a yellow light flashed from the room next door.</p><p class="double">A cross between a sea serpent and a Shop-Vac poked its head through the door. &quot;INCOMING MESSAGE, JOEL,&quot; it shrieked in an unearthly voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;Incoming message from Gizmonics Institute,&quot; a much saner female voice added. &quot;Please report to the bridge for incoming message.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, at least it can&#039;t get better,&quot; Discord said quietly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t you mean, &#039;it can&#039;t get worse?&#039;&quot; the yellow robot asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, thanks so very much for that,&quot; Discord grumbled. &quot;You&#039;ve just jinxed us all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, you&#039;re welcome- what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord and the robots moved into the next room, which had a single control panel with only three clownishly large buttons on it.

Standing in the middle of it wearing a sickly green lab coat stood a man with wild, uncombed hair, standard-issue geek glasses and a truly objectionable mustache. &quot;Ah, hello, Joel Discord,&quot; he said. &quot;I think you can tell by your current surroundings that your job performance review didn&#039;t go all that well.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dr. Forrester,&quot; Discord said. &quot;I- no. No I am NOT going along with this!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes! Yes, but you are!&quot; Dr. Forrester grinned. &quot;You see, I needed a guinea pig for my experiments on breaking the human psyche. I have a theory that, if only I can expose normal humans to the most mind-searingly awful movies ever made, I will be able to destroy human civilization and take over for my own- are you taking notes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just a moment,&quot; Discord said, scribbling madly on a notepad, &quot;... &#039;destroy-human-civilization.&#039; Got it. Sounds like a marvelously evil idea!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why, thank you!&quot; Dr. Forrester said. &quot;So you can see how evil my idea is, we&#039;re going to begin now! It&#039;s a collaboration between American movie giant Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Japanese movie giant Toei, and it truly brings together the worst of both worlds! It&#039;s a little stinkburger entitled <i>The Green Slime.</i> Buckle up, Bunkie!&quot;</p><p class="double">The room shook as red flashing lights cycled overhead, joined by the red button on the console, which flashed its own alarm.</p><p class="double">&quot;Movie sign,&quot; the calm female voice said over the screams of Discord and the robots. &quot;We have movie sign.

<p>64.1&nbsp;&nbsp;(Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luke Skywalker peered at the row of droids the Jawas were offering. <i>Looks like we&#039;re hosting guests.</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">The negotiations for the droids had gone as usual, except he was now leading a gloss-white 3P0 unit with pink and lavender highlights, and a pale-yellow and bright-red astromech into the garage for cleaning. The two droids were more subdued than their baseline versions. He wasn&#039;t sure if they were still trying to assimilate their new setting, or just politely waiting for a more private venue.</p><p class="double">&quot;This oil bath is going to feel so good,&quot; said the protocol droid. The voice was definitely feminine and had a distinctly youthful timbre.</p><p class="double">&quot;Since we&#039;re in private, I think we can drop the pretenses and get down to introductions. I&#039;m Luke Skywalker, the first local Looper most visitors encounter. Welcome to Tatooine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I am Sweet-Threepio, equine – sorry, force of habit – human-cyborg relations. And this is my counterpart, Apple-Deetoo.&quot;</p><p class="double">The yellow-and-red astromech beeped a mildly frustrated greeting. After a pause, the speaker emitted a series of garbled syllables that resolved into intelligible Galactic Basic. &quot;...Darn translation software. Is this better?&quot; The voice was also a youthful female, with a mid-rim twang by way of an accent.</p><p class="double">Luke nodded. &quot;Much.&quot; He turned back to Threepio. &quot;You said &#039;equine&#039;?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...Yes. We&#039;re normally ponies. From Equestria?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. I&#039;ve heard of you guys, but haven&#039;t had a chance to visit yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I bet you&#039;ve had a fair number of visitors who know this place amazingly well despite having never been here before.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. It was kind of disconcerting until I got ahold of vids from the Hub. It also explained some of the new variants that cropped up lately.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So y&#039;all want to see Leia&#039;s holo?&quot; asked Apple.</p><p class="double">&quot;Please.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Astromech&#039;s holoprojector flickered to life and ran through the entirety of the message.</p><p class="double">&quot;Too bad. Doesn&#039;t look like Leia&#039;s Awake.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Variation in how the message is worded?&quot; inquired Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I was wonderin&#039; why she didn&#039;t react to my color scheme,&quot; mused Apple.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Yoda&#039;s hut...Dagobah</i>, sighed Twilight Sparkle to herself. Her Loop memories informed her that it was 19 years after the end of the Clone Wars. If she recalled the movies correctly, it would be another 3 years before anyone was scheduled to show up. <i>Okay. I can either vegetate here, catch up on my reading, play with the Force for a bit, or...</i> A stray thought combined with her recollection of the contents of her subspace pocket. <i>I wonder...</i></p><p class="double">She started limping toward the pond where Luke would plant his fighter in a few years. <i>Right. I&#039;m in 900-year-old Yoda&#039;s body now</i>, she reminded herself. <i>I think I&#039;ll go quadruped.</i> With a flash, she Ascended and quickly reverted to the more familiar lavender unicorn. <i>Much better.</i> She trotted the rest of the way to the nearby clearing.</p><p class="double">After some awkward sorting through her pocket, she looked at the shiny new T-65C X-Wing parked next to the pond with mild satisfaction. <i>I don&#039;t think Scootaloo will mind if I borrow this for a quick trip to Tatooine...Um...Wait.</i> Her past experience suggested that the loop usually started at the same time the movies did. That usually meant Tatooine would be under Imperial occupation by the time she could get there; showing up in a Rebel Alliance starfighter would just be asking for trouble.</p><p class="double"><i>Of course! I can go to Bespin and then arrange for a passenger ticket to Tatooine. Right. Now to fire this baby up and load the hyperspace coordinates into...the...astro...mech...</i></p><p class="double">She didn&#039;t have an astromech droid. Scootaloo said that she&#039;d asked Apple Bloom keep hers for when there was time to tinker with it.</p><p class="double"><i>Xylem!!</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">&quot;So how long do your loops usually run?&quot; asked Sweetie as the landspeeder cruised toward the Jundland Wastes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Depends. About half the time, it wraps after the Battle of Endor. But some variants can go as far as forty...forty-five years after that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What about native loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re replacing two of them; Artoo much more often than Threepio...Leia, Han and Chewie...Ben less often...Occasionally Lando and Wedge. No Imperials besides dad and Mara, thank the Force.&quot; Luke had had nightmares about the prospect of a Looping Palpatine. Or worse, a Looping Thrawn.</p><p class="double">&quot;My sensors seem to pickin&#039; up some bantha-sized life forms about 1500 meters ahead,&quot; interrupted the droid laying on the back deck of the speeder. &quot;That sound about right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. It&#039;s about the right time and place to meet up with Ben,&quot; said Luke as Sweetie started slowing down.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa! Got a real big reptilian life form just beyond the banthas, and it&#039;s closin&#039; fast. If those banthas are carryin&#039; sandpeople, they&#039;re runnin&#039; to the north now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s definitely not baseline. Take us southward, Threepio, and keep us behind that ridge,&quot; instructed the moisture farmer.</p><p class="double">A somewhat familiar combination of a roar and howl sounded, then a large reptilian form poked its head over the ridgeline that the speeder was now paralleling. It was a mostly purple head, with green spines.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen a krayt dragon with those colors,&quot; observed Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;SPIKE??&quot; chorused the droids.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">After allowing herself 5 minutes of semi-coherent ranting, Twilight returned her thoughts to the problem at hoof. <i>Okay. I need an FTL conveyance that will get me to a nearby star system with some sort of passenger service. Since I can&#039;t replicate Dash&#039;s self-propelled warp speed stunt, that means a ship...Now do I have anything...</i> She scowled as she ran through her pocket&#039;s inventory list again... <i>It&#039;s definitely not ideal, but it might be good enough.</i></p><p class="double">More awkward manipulation replaced the X-Wing with a Starfleet Type 6 shuttlecraft. Fortunately, Apple Bloom had spared some attention to this particular ship in a past loop, so instead of the meager Warp 4 top speed, Twilight had been assured that it could sustain Warp 5.7. Now all she had to do was dig up Yoda&#039;s astrogation database (how else could Luke have figured out how to get to Bespin from here?) and convert it to something the shuttle&#039;s computer could understand...<i>Chlorophyll...</i></p><p class="double">With an annoyed grumble, she trudged back to Yoda&#039;s hut, mentally composing a letter that she had no intention of actually sending.</p><p class="double"><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i></p><p class="double"><i>Today I learned that I need to spend a lot more time on contingency planning for bizarre technology combinations.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Your frustrated student,</i></p><p><i>Twilight Sparkle</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">It was certainly shaping up as one of the more interesting loops in recent memory, Luke decided. One seldom sees a krayt dragon shape-shift into a purple-and-green Barabel.</p><p class="double">&quot;Y&#039;know. It&#039;s still kinda strange to see this place as a desert. One time I was here, it was almost as green as Naboo. It made quite the impression,&quot; said Spikey-one Kenobi absently as they went to the small cairn where he had left his jedi robes and other equipment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Naboo?&quot; asked Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twenty-odd years and a whole lot of loops ago. Friend of ours got stuck here for ten years and took up extreme terraforming as a hobby,&quot; explained Spike, shrugging into his robes and fastening the belt.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Spike? Do you know if anypony else is along for the ride?&quot; asked Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;I got just one Magic when I checked earlier, and she&#039;s a long way off. Definitely not on this planet,&quot; answered the Jedi.</p><p class="double">&quot;Some of us have the ability to sense if others from our home loop are Awake. It&#039;s...complicated...&quot; Apple Bloom said in response to Luke&#039;s confused expression.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you want to drop by Ben&#039;s place to pick up Anakin&#039;s old lightsaber?&quot; asked Spike, raising the hood of his robe against the suns.</p><p class="double">Luke shook his head. He idly produced a pair of lightsabers from his own subspace pocket, then returned them. &quot;Experience does have its advantages.&quot; He glanced at the position of the twin suns. &quot;Anyway, if we make for Mos Eisley now, there&#039;s a chance we can link up with Han and Chewie and get off-planet before the Imps get their act together and set up their blockade in earnest.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m the one who&#039;s all about &#039;Avoiding Imperial entanglements&#039;,&quot; agreed Spike. &quot;Let&#039;s go.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken nearly five hours, but the preflight checks were complete, and she had something resembling a warp-compatible version of a hyperspace route that should take her to Tatooine. (She had indulged in another three minutes of berating herself for not realizing that a Federation Shuttle would draw less imperial attention than an X-Wing.)</p><p class="double">After ransacking the hut for potentially useful items (about five hundred credits worth of old currency, and a Yoda-scale lightsaber), Twilight was more than ready to say good riddance to the slimy mudhole.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, the trip to orbit was uneventful, as was the transition to warp speed.</p><p class="double">The journey itself, living down to Twlight&#039;s expectations for the loop, was not at all pleasant.</p><p class="double">The good news was that the warp engines were behaving like a high-performance hyperdrive, so she would arrive much sooner than she had expected.</p><p class="double">The not-so-good news was that the intertial dampers weren&#039;t quite up to handling the subspace turbulence, so it was a very rough ride. On top of that, she had to make constant adjustments to the warp field.</p><p class="double">The practical upshot was the trip that she anticipated would take around thirty hours, during which she could have at least two six-hour blocks of much-desired sleep plus time to brush up on her Force abilities, had taken sixteen uncomfortable, concentration-heavy, sleepless hours.</p><p class="double">Now parked on the far side of the closest of Tatooine&#039;s moons – fortuitously positioned in line-of-sight to Mos Eisley – she deployed a pair of stealthed surveillance drones. Alpha would be tasked with patrolling Mos Eisley and its immediate environs, Beta was to scan the region around the Lars homestead and the Jundland Wastes. Blessed with a few spare hours to allow the drones to reach their positions and collect enough data to create useful maps, she could take time for some deep jedi meditation. <i>I&#039;ve gotten really rusty with this stuff</i>, she scolded herself before going under in earnest.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Hannah &quot;Scoots&quot; Solo Awoke in her bunk on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, she couldn&#039;t help squee-ing quietly when her Loop memories settled in. <i>Yes! I&#039;m Han Rooting Solo! I&#039;m gonna fly the </i>Falcon<i>!</i></p><p class="double">She had some previous experience with this setting; there had been a ponies-only variant where Dash was in Han&#039;s slot, Angel was the Wookiee, Applejack got cast as the farmer, Rarity was Leia, and Twilight found herself as the semi-retired Jedi Master, facing off against an unawake Darth Nightmare. Scootaloo had been relegated to Wedge&#039;s role, but at least she&#039;d gotten a fair amount of stick time in an X-Wing. That had actually been pretty fun, even if none of the other CMC had been around for it.</p><p class="double"><i>You seem happy</i>, observed Pansy. <i>Been here before?</i></p><p class="double">Before she could answer, a growl from outside the small room interrupted. Her Loop memories handled the translation from Shyriiwook.</p><p class="double">{{I say. Is that you, old friend, or do I have the honor of hosting a guest?}}</p><p class="double">Scootaloo blinked. Who knew that Shyriiwook was such a polite language?</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m afraid Han&#039;s not here. Chewbacca, I presume?&quot; she asked, climbing out of her bunk and opening the door.</p><p class="double">{{Indeed I am. May I ask who I have the pleasure of greeting?}} The Wookiee took in the young, violet-haired human female.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...yeah. Name&#039;s Scootaloo, pegasus pony from Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">{{Charmed. I believe we may have an acquaintance in common. There was a painfully earnest fellow with the name of Carrot Ironfounderson who replaced our resident young jedi once upon a loop. He had mentioned visiting your home in passing. It sounded lovely.}}</p><p class="double">&quot;Um...I don&#039;t want to seem rude, but is there anything immediate we need to take care of? If I understand my loop memories correctly, we&#039;re laying low trying to avoid Jabba&#039;s mooks until we can find a paying gig, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">{{Excellent! Straight to the point. You have the gist of our situation perfectly. I gather that you have some familiarity with how our baseline operates, yes? Assuming no significant variation, we usually bump into the young gentleman and his elderly jedi mentor in about four hours. In any event, before I inquired as to your status, I received confirmation that Luke is Awake, and will be bringing guests; both droids I gather. Alas, he also indicated that his sister does not share his status this time.}} explained Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay. I wonder who wound up as the droids. Is there time for me to take a good look at the ship?&quot;</p><p class="double">{{About half an hour before the first of Jabba&#039;s thugs starts skulking around the area. Oh. I should mention that Luke has been showing up about an hour early in recent loops. It avoids the unfortunate altercation with Ponda Baba.}}</p><p class="double">&quot;Anything else you think I should know about?&quot;</p><p class="double">{{Ah, yes. If you were wondering about the incident with poor Greedo, I fear that there is no easy way to avoid it, as he usually has Chalmun&#039;s staked out well before we can arrive. As you might expect, Han always gets off the first and only shot when he&#039;s Awake.}}</p><p class="double">Scootaloo looked at the holster and gunbelt coiled on the worktable and suppressed a shudder.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Moderately refreshed by her trance, Twilight scrutinized the take from her surveillance drones. She was looking for an unobserved, yet open area to serve as a teleportation target zone. She had considered one of the unused docking bay in Mos Eisley, but had to reject them due to the control towers associated with them.</p><p class="double">Alpha was now looking at the outskirts of the spaceport town. There was a shallow canyon a couple of kilometers to the southwest that might serve her needs.</p><p class="double">Shifting her attention to Beta, the image of a dusty brown landspeeder cruising toward Mos Eisley appeared on her screen. Zooming in, she could make out the white protocol droid and yellow astromech on the rear deck. She could make a good guess about the identity of the blonde-headed driver, but not the brown-hooded passenger.</p><p class="double">Ordering Beta to her planned canyon target zone, she established an atmosphere bubble spell around herself. She then left the shuttle and put its systems in standby mode, tucking it back into her subspace pocket. Finally, she carefully low-grav hopped to a position where she had a line-of-sight to the planet. <i>Looks like all that low orbit work I did when I was playing with X-Com is paying dividends.</i> Concentrating on the image from the Alpha&#039;s camera, she teleported...</p><p class="double">...And found herself five meters above the canyon floor. A panicked levitation spell cushioned what would have been an uncomfortable landing. Retrieving the drone control unit from her pocket, she ordered Alpha to monitor the route between the canyon and the town proper.</p><p class="double"><i>Twenty minutes until Beta is close enough to retrieve. I suppose I should at least make myself more comfortable while I wait.</i> A chameleon-cloth tent from her subspace pocket provided some shelter from the twin suns.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luke explained that the local garrison would be assigned to patrol, Mos Eisley while a detachment from Vader&#039;s <i>Devastator</i> handled the search for the droids. There was a narrow window of time between the <i>Devastator</i>&#039;s departure for the Death Star and the arrival of the three relieving star destroyers when the only orbital presence was a pair of antique customs frigates. &quot;The <i>Falcon</i> can and did run the more powerful blockade, but why make things harder on yourself if you don&#039;t have to?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How solid is that time window?&quot; asked Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not as firm as I&#039;d like,&quot; admitted Luke. &quot;Here comes the checkpoint. Would you care to do the honours?&quot;</p><p class="double">Despite Spike&#039;s mild trepidation, the encounter went as smoothly as anyone could have asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Whew,&quot; murmured Spike as they cruised into the town. &quot;It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve had to do that. Most of the time, I just need the battle precognition and telekinesis...&quot;</p><p class="double">They pulled up outside Chalmun&#039;s Cantina. Luke handed Sweetie a small comlink. &quot;They don&#039;t serve mechanicals, so you two might as well be the outer security perimeter. Since we&#039;re early, I think we can avoid most of the usual encounters.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Got it,&quot; acknowledged the protocol droid. Watching the two biologicals enter the establishment, she asked her counterpart. &quot;How you doing, Apple Bloom?&quot;</p><p class="double">The astromech rotated her dome through three revolutions. &quot;This is pretty neat. I ain&#039;t done much time as an artificial life form; it&#039;s interestin&#039; to experience it from this side. Cookie&#039;s still a little overwhelmed, though. Too bad those jump jets were removed, I kinda want to see how well I can fly. How &#039;bout you, Sweets?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Clover&#039;s also trying to get used to all this. I guess I shouldn&#039;t complain, but this body is more awkward than I&#039;d like, and I suspect the baseline programming is what&#039;s behind the urge to mimic Rarity at her most prim and proper...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">One side effect of Twilight&#039;s investigations of Silver Spoon&#039;s unstable species situation was a renewed interest in transformation spells. She had spent quite a bit of time with Fluttershy and Chrysalis trying to understand how their abilities in the area worked. While nowhere near as adept as those two, she felt that she had a solid grasp of the basics. It was time to put that belief to the test.</p><p class="double">There were very few sapient quadrupedal species in this galaxy, so trying to get past the imperial checkpoints as a purple unicorn probably wasn&#039;t going to work out that well. Therefore, she needed to become a biped to better blend in. She could take on the form she had in the Canterlot High School universe, but she was feeling adventurous and wanted to try something a little more exotic. Putting the image of her desired new shape firmly in mind, she let the magic gather and flow around her.</p><p class="double">Several very uncomfortable minutes later, she examined the results in the full length mirror she had pulled out of her pocket eariler.</p><p class="double">A lavender twi&#039;lek female gazed back at her.</p><p class="double">A naked lavender twi&#039;lek female.</p><p class="double"><i>Well, at least it looks like everything&#039;s where it should be.</i> She twitched a lekku experimentally, then flexed her hands a few times, and walked several circuits around the tent&#039;s interior. Finally, she used the Force to summon a few nearby pebbles to her. <i>I guess it&#039;ll do for now.</i></p><p class="double">Sighing yet again, she started rummaging in her pocket for her limited selection of humanoid clothing. I <i>hope my Canterlot High blouse and skirt won&#039;t look too strange on this body. Next chance I get, I&#039;m learning that &quot;Instant Wardrobe&quot; spell from Rarity and talking to Apple Bloom about holographic clothing projectors...</i></p><p class="double"><i><hr></i></p><p class="double">Luke and Spike paused in the entry foyer of the cantina to let their vision adjust to the much darker interior.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good. Ponda Baba and Evazan aren&#039;t here yet, so that&#039;s one annoying encounter avoided,&quot; murmured Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;Another reason why you wanted to get here early?&quot; asked Spike.</p><p class="double">Luke nodded and started a slow walk toward Han&#039;s usual booth near the back entrance. He quickly spotted Chewbacca who made the &quot;Awake, with guest&quot; gesture. In a low voice, he told Spike, &quot;There&#039;s a substitute for Han. Might be a friend of yours.&quot; In his experience, it was very unusual for guest loopers to originate from more than one setting.</p><p class="double">The violet-haired smuggler took in the purple barabel jedi, then grinned. &quot;Spikey-one Kenobi, I presume?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me guess...&#039;Hannah Solo&#039;?&quot; A return grin. &quot;How ya doin&#039; Squirt?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! Only Dash gets away with calling me that. Chewie tells me that the droids are also along?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Sweets and Bloom.&quot; Spike nodded. &quot;I also pinged one of the Magics earlier, but I have no idea where she is. No time to do a more comprehensive scan – and it might have alerted Vader anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">{{Seeing friends together is always pleasant, no?}} Chewbacca asked Luke. {{Is there anything special happening, or do you want to go with the rapid departure plan?}}</p><p class="double">Luke&#039;s expression had gone distant. &quot;I...Damn. One Star Destroyer showed up early. I think our best escape window will be in around two hours, but I&#039;ll need to spend some time tracking it to firm up that estimate.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;By the by, Scoots. I just spotted a green rodian lurking over that way,&quot; muttered Spike with a faint head gesture toward a booth on the other side of the cantina.</p><p class="double">{{That one does not confront unless his quarry is alone. We could all depart together if you do not feel up to dealing with him,}} offered Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">&quot;No. I got this,&quot; replied Scootaloo, her hand dropping to her holstered blaster. Spike raised an eyeridge, but said nothing.</p><p class="double">The two jedi emerged into the baking double sunlight and made their way to the landspeeder. Chewbacca was last seen headed for the back entrance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Any problems?&quot; asked Bloom.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not on our end. &#039;Scoots&#039; Solo, on the other hand...&quot; said Spike worriedly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Greedo?&quot; queried Sweetie. Spike nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;To think that this is the first time some of you have been here,&quot; observed their host.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sorry. I think we&#039;ve all watched the videos at least five times each,&quot; apologized the protocol droid.</p><p class="double">There was the faint sound of a single blaster discharge from inside.</p><p class="double">&quot;That doesn&#039;t quite sound like Han&#039;s DL-44,&quot; said Luke thoughtfully.</p><p class="double">A minute later, Solo emerged from the main entrance wearing a grim smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s amazing how many people forget these things have a stun setting,&quot; she said, patting the holstered blaster.</p><p class="double">Spike gestured at the two-seat speeder. &quot;We&#039;d offer you a lift to the <i>Falcon</i>, but...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I can walk,&quot; said Luke. &quot;It&#039;s not that far, and I certainly know the way.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A brown-cloaked figure rode a speeder bike slowly away from the checkpoint toward the row of docking bays.</p><p class="double">Since the stormtroopers&#039; instructions were to look for droids, a lone figure on a single-seat vehicle was not part of their search profile, so a quick identity scan – itself dispensed with by a quiet application of Force pursuasion – was all she needed to enter the spaceport.</p><p class="double">To her mild surprise, Twilight had found a jedi cloak that fit her new form remarkably well. Underneath, she wore a cobbled-together amalgam of a dark red Drasnian merchant&#039;s tunic, khaki slacks from a semi-casual pant-suit she&#039;d picked up during a Police Procedural loop, and starfleet uniform boots. Rarity would doubtlessly faint at the sight of her ensemble.</p><p class="double">She pulled up outside of docking bay 94 next to the weathered brown landspeeder. She paused to run a hand over the starboard engine pod, but the heat of the afternoon suns made it impossible to determine how recently it had been shut down.</p><p class="double">Walking slowly into the docking bay proper, she stopped to gaze at the Fastest Hunk of Junk in the Galaxy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Can I help you...miss?&quot; asked a familiar voice. A young-ish female human with bright purple hair, black vest over a white shirt, navy blue uniform trousers with red stripes, black boots, and a heavy blaster pistol in a low-slung holster emerged from behind a landing strut. She was pulling on a pair of gray-brown flying gloves.</p><p class="double">Twilight pushed back her cloak&#039;s hood, revealing her lavender-skinned head. Recognition dawned in the pilot&#039;s eyes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Spike! Someone here to see you!&quot; she called. It was obvious that Scootaloo was trying very hard to conceal amusement behind a cool demeanor.</p><p class="double">A purple-and-green barabel wearing a brown jedi cloak came down the passenger ramp and took in the visitor. A wide grin – made more disconcerting by the mouth full of sharp reptilian teeth -- spread across the faintly familiar face. Spike made no attempt to conceal his amusement. He seemed to come to a decision and enunciated very clearly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twi&#039;lek Sparkle, I presume?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo lost her composure completely and collapsed against the landing strut in gales of laughter. Spike was little better, chortling loudly and clinging to a ramp support piston.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hate you two so much right now,&quot; was all the face-palming Twilight could manage.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">64.2 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The sky was lime green, with purple swirls. The ground was flashing between chocolate checkerboard, yellow astroturf, and grass, as her spells kept trying to undo the chaos magic. The sun was locked directly overhead, with the moon orbiting it.</p><p class="double">Twilight Woke up right then, in the middle of a shouting match with an oddly familiar white bearded, brown coated alicorn. The two of them stopped mid-rant, as their loop memories fell into place. A synchronized face-hoof later, the two marched up to eachother.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot; The alicorn asked in a familiar voice, &quot;Why am I a pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know, Discord.&quot; She replied. &quot;You seem to have your usual powers, just... as an alicorn. You don&#039;t leave your baseline form often, do you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No... How <i>do</i> you get by without thumbs? I can&#039;t snap my fingers, and it <i>bugs</i> me.&quot; As he spoke, Discord put the moon back into its proper orbit.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d say you learn to live with it, but I kinda had it the other way around. What were we fighting about, when we woke up? Ye olde Chaos vs Order, I think?&quot; Twilight nibbled on some white chocolate checkerboard, the rest of the grass having been returned to normal.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, something droll like tha-&quot; A shout cut him off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, Sister! While they are distracted!&quot; Is that?</p><p class="double">&quot;That is not stealth, Luna!&quot; Oh dear.</p><p class="double">They looked to the side, just in time for the flash of rainbow light to hit them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...The two mighty alicorns, fought for control of the land. The Lady of Order clashed with the Master of Chaos, the lands and very sky shuddering and twisting to their power.</p><p class="double">Finally, the two Sisters brought to bear the most powerful magic known to ponydom: the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, they defeated the warring Tyrants, and banished them permanently in the moon.</p><p class="double">The Sisters led Equestria into a new age of peace, and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since.&quot;</p><p class="double">The black unicorn looked up from the book, as she Woke up. &quot;Well, okay then.&quot; Nyx commented.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">They had not heeded the warning Luna&#039;s student had given them, and now they were about to pay the price. The festival was in full swing, they were surrounded by innocents, and the Lady of Order stood before them. She was asking about... what?</p><p class="double">&quot;An ID. You never revoked my citizenship, but I still need a proper ID before I can really do much of anything. You two are the only ponies that remember me, so I have to ask you to vouch for me. The pony at the office didn&#039;t believe me when I gave my name.&quot; The purple alicorn calmly repeated.</p><p class="double">&quot;...And where is your rival? We will not allow you to plunge this land into another period of strife!&quot; Celestia did not allow her old enemy&#039;s manner to cloud her judgement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Over by the punch table. I think the mares are making him feel a little uncomfortable.&quot; A purple hoof pointed, to where the brown alicorn seemed to be hemmed in by starry-eyed mares.</p><p class="double">&quot;So tall!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That beard!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Centuries</i> of experiance, Rose, I&#039;m telling you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That <i>beard!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Now girls, there&#039;s enough of him for all of us.”</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;That beard!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Help! I need an adult!&quot; Discord tripped as he tried backing away. As he fell onto his back, the mares descended in a chorus of girlish cheer.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Months later, they had finally convinced Celestia and Luna to allow them to release the statue that had taken Discord&#039;s usual place in the gardens. Who it was, was both amusing and confusing to them, until they heard the name of the &quot;statue&quot; itself.</p><p class="double">Thus, they were gathered along side the Elements, to free the mare known as Obsession from her prison. Looking at Cadance&#039;s perplexed stone face, Nyx lit up her Element to cast the spell. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">64.3 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">As Scootaloo awoke, her loop memories were telling her that she was in for a great time this loop. She was a world famous astronaut, she&#039;d written her own book, she was running for governor of Kentucky, and she was a giant chicken.</p><p class="double">She tried saying &#039;What?&#039;, but what came out sounded like &quot;Bwak?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Reporters had gather around Ms. Scooter &#039;Scoots&#039; Boo as she gave a short q&amp;a session on a stand in a public park.</p><p class="double">One reporter spoke up. &quot;Ms. Boo, what are your plans for revitalizing the ecoonomy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bwak.&quot;</p><p class="double">That sent titters of laughter through the crowd.</p><p class="double">&quot;Seriously, though.&quot; the reporter continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;Bak, Back-ah!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thank you, next question.&quot; said an aide to Scootaloo&#039;s right.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ms. Boo, whats your opinion of the situation with the Russkies?&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo lowered her head and responded solemnly. &quot;Bak, bwak.&quot;</p><p class="double">The crowd responded appreciatively. &quot;Thank you, next question.&quot;</p><p class="double">A third reporter stepped forward and in a thick southern drawl, asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ms. Boo, I heard you&#039;re a giant chicken. Care to comment on that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shock ran through the crowd, and the rest of the reporters turned on the last question giver.</p><p class="double">As all attention was being given to the altercation, no one noticed a frisbee flying in the direction of Scootaloo&#039;s head, and knocking her wig off.</p><p class="double">The fracas paused, realization coming over the crowd.</p><p class="double">They now turned her attention to her, with Scootaloo holding up her wings in a placating gesture.</p><p class="double">&quot;She is a chicken! Get her!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Scootaloo dusted herself off. Her popularity in the polls had taken a nosedive and she&#039;d suddenly found the need to disappear. As she walked off into the sunset, she wondered if maybe a trip to Hollywood wouldn&#039;t be in order. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">64.4 (Goldude, Wing Zero 032)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;EX-TER-MIN-ATE!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked behind her and sighed. &quot;Trixie, you&#039;re not a Dalek.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;EX-TER-MIN-ATE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Doctor Who is a Read-Only Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;EX-TER-MIN-ATE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Your costume is atrocious.

Okay, now I was thinking...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">64.6 (TricornKing)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy Awoke to find herself in her cottage. Checking her memories, she smiled as she confirmed that this seemed to be a fairly baseline loop, at least so far. It was the day before the Summer Sun Celebration, which meant that Twilight would be arriving in just a few hours from Canterlot.</p><p class="double">As she went down the stairs, idly wondering whether Luna was awake this loop and what they would all do with Nightmare Moon if she wasn&#039;t, Fluttershy heard a strange sound coming from her kitchen. Multiple sounds, like small voices.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fwuff? Fwuff fwuff fwuff FWuff fwuff fwuff!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fwuff! Fwuffa wuffa wuff fwuff!&quot;</p><p>There was the sound of two smacks, and a third voice, sounding deeper than the others, said, &quot;FWUFF-UP! Fuffa Wuffa Waff Fwaff!&quot;</p><p class="double">By now extremely puzzled, Fluttershy pecked her head into the kitchen. There on her floor where four extremely fluffy, short ponies, about the size of the Cutie Mark Crusaders. One was light blue, the second was pink with a yellow mane, and the third was pure white with no mane and a brown beard, something she&#039;d once heard Twilight refer to as a &quot;Lincoln chin curtain&quot;. Off to the side, the fourth brown one was having a staring contest with a very confused Angely Bunny. Except for the white one, they all had noticeably large buckteeth, and rather large than average ears.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, excuse me?&quot; Fluttershy said before they could start fighting again. Try as she could to remember, none of her Loop memories had anything related to these four strange ponies.</p><p class="double">Startled, the four fluffy ponies looked up at her. Glaring at his companions, the bearded fluffy walked up to her and cleared his throat. Fluttershy immediately recognized it as the third voice she&#039;d heard. &quot;Fwuffa Ba Ba Ba-fwuff?&quot;</p><p class="double">Cocking her head, Fluttershy just stared in confusion. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t understand you. What language are you speaking?&quot;</p><p class="double">The bearded woolly pony frowned for a moment. Sitting down, he began tapping the ground a bit with his front hoof. Just then, Fluttershy swore she saw a light bulb appear above his head, and the bearded woolly pony jumped up in the air, shouting, &quot;Eur-fwuff-a!&quot;</p><p class="double">Standing on his hind legs, the pony began rubbing his front hooves over his throat. As he began speaking, Fluttershy wasn&#039;t quite sure, but she thought she heard the sound of a radio changing its dial. &quot;Fwuff...Babababa...Ca...Cafwuff...Can you understand me now?&quot;</p><p class="double">Though still confused, Fluttershy nodded. &quot;Yes, that&#039;s much better. Who are you? If you don&#039;t mind my asking?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not at all my dear,&quot; said the white fluffy, smiling at her. &quot;Just a second though.&quot; Turning towards his companions, the bearded pony walked towards them. Saying something in their strange language, he began massaging their throats as they spoke, until each of them was able to speak Fluttershy&#039;s language. To her surprise and mild disapproval, their leader slapped the brown one to get him out of his staring contest with Angel. Strangely though, the brown one just laughed as his leader massaged his vocal cords.</p><p class="double">Bringing his friends before her, the leader cleared his throat. &quot;Please excuse us. We&#039;re not used to being able to speak like humans.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Humans? You mean you&#039;re Loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">The leader nodded. &quot;We could be. We usually inhabit a human world though, and we certainly don&#039;t look like this,&quot; he gestured towards his body. &quot;Though the buck teeth and long ears are a bit of a relief.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. So, who are you exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">The sounds of an oompah band started playing, and Fluttershy and Angel watched as the fluffy, woolly ponies began to sing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooooh! We are the Fluffs! (Boom-boom) Good Moonie Fluffs! (Boom-boom)</p><p>We are escapes from Nightmare Land</p><p>Our Nightmarish Queen doesn&#039;t understand</p><p>We just can&#039;t horrify or terrify</p><p>Can&#039;t even work up a fright</p><p>We just get laughs when we go boo in the night</p><p>When Fluffies are good (Boom-boom)</p><p>They&#039;re misunderstood (Boom-boom)</p><p>Though we may separate</p><p>Or come in clumps</p><p>We get so blue</p><p>Cause when we say boo</p><p>Nobody jumps from fright!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Before we awoke,&quot; explained the bearded pony, &quot;we had just managed to escape from Nightmare Land. Or what you would call the Moon. The Nightmare Queen is planning to invade your land tomorrow with a great army of Nightmares. She is using our people as her warriors!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I stiww don&#039;t see why we need to get invowved,&quot; said the light blue fluffy. &quot;We&#039;we awake now, wet these big pow-nies deaw with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bearded fluffy growled, &quot;You remember our baseline? How a thousand of you used robes to tear the continents apart, just so you could have a continent of your own? Shaped. Like. Us?! That was when you all were still stupid! Imagine what our fellows are like now, in these smarter pony bodies, with the Nightmare&#039;s powers?!&quot; At the last part he was shouting at them, smacking each one in a row not unlike in a Three Stooges routine.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, excuse me,&quot; said Fluttershy, pointing at the leader, &quot;but why are you the only one without a lisp?&quot;</p><p class="double">The leader sighed. &quot;Because in our baseline, I&#039;m actually their smarter ancestor. Which means that I&#039;m apparently the Loop-ordained guardian of these nitwits.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooh, nits!&quot; said the blue fluffy.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooh, twits!&quot; added the pink one.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wonder what&#039;s for dinner?&quot; said the brown one.</p><p class="double">All three then looked at each other and just burst into laughter. Looking from them to Fluttershy, the bearded fluffy sighed. &quot;See what I mean?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy raised a hoof to politely cover the small smile on her face. While she did sympathize with the leader, she couldn&#039;t help but find them cute and amusing. They vaguely reminded her of Pinkie Pie at her most outlandish for some reason.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, my name is Fluttershy, and this is Angel Bunny,&quot; Fluttershy said as she pointed at herself then her pet. &quot;While I&#039;m not the Anchor here, I&#039;d still like to welcome you to Equestria. Our Anchor, Twilight, should be arriving in a few hours, so we can meet her at the library and you can tell her what you told me.&quot;</p><p class="double">The bearded fluffy gave her a warm smile. &quot;Thank you Fluttershy. My name is Cave. As for my friends here, they are Rose, Clair Bleu, and Brun.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, first time visitor?&quot; asked Twilight as she walked towards her library. Pinkie had introduced her to a new guest looper. He was a light-brown earth pony with orange hair, wearing a purple hoodie with a red trim and a white circle around his barrel. On all four of his hooves were white sneakers, though Twilight suspected the ones on the front hooves were more like gloves than shoes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yeah. It&#039;s actually kind of nice. Still feels weird having limps connecting my hands and feet to my body though. Same with the neck too.&quot; The guest looper revved up one of his forelegs, and swung it hoof up in the air. To Twilight&#039;s surprise, it stretched out a few feet above them like rubber before coming back down. &quot;Glad I can still do that though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Well this should make an interesting loop, thought Twilight to herself. As she opened the door and let him in, she heard Fluttershy&#039;s voice calling to her. &quot;Just a second Fluttershy, I want you to meet a new Guest Looper. Before he awoke he was Ray Shine.&quot; As she saw Fluttershy walk up to her, Twilight turned to their guest. &quot;But I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s not what you want us to call you?&quot;</p><p class="double">Smiling, Ray Shine shook his head. &quot;Please, call me Rayman.&quot;</p><p class="double">Just then they all heard a crash. Turning to the source, all three ponies saw Cave in front of a pile of books. One by one, each of the fluffies rose from the pile, staring straight at Rayman. &quot;Way...man...?&quot; said Clair Bleu.</p><p class="double">Something in the way those three fluffies looked at him set alarm bells off in Rayman&#039;s head. &quot;Y-yes?&quot;</p><p class="double">All three fluffies in the book pile suddenly drew out giant plungers. Their bodies started shaking, their eyes turned red and they roared out &quot;BAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!&quot; before charging at Rayman. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">64.7 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Now was the hour. Luna had prepared for this moment for loops. Careful planning, stockpiling critical materials in her pocket, entire loops spent designing and learning with Apple Bloom, all of it had come down to this moment.</p><p class="double">Standing at the head of her batpony army, she saw her sister&#039;s forces arrayed against her. Her still moon hung where she had stopped it, four days prior, and now, as the sun entered eclipse for the fifth time, she made her play.</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Hear me, Equestria! Soldiers of Celestia! My loyal followers!</b></p><p><b>For too long has the night gone unappreciated! For too long, ponies have looked to the darkness in nought but fear! For too long, have they looked upon </b><i><b>I as the embodyment of that fear!</b></i></p><p class="double"><b>No longer, say I! If Equestria does not want me, than I shall hold no loyalty to it! I shall seek my own nation, free from its prejudices! At sunset, I shall take those loyal to me to forge a new nation! Further, I shall take with us the moon that Equestria so scorns!</b></p><p class="double"><b>Hear me, Sister, for I shall not be swayed from this course. On the longest day of the thousandth year, I shall return. Farewell.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">As Luna turned away, the echoes of the Royal Canterlot Voice fading, one could have heard a pin drop from across the field.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia was worried, for both her sister and those that had followed her. True to her word, those loyal to Luna had gathered around her, bringing families and supplies, and as the last rays of sunlight left the sky, the thousands of them vanished in a massive flash of teleportation.</p><p class="double">That had been a year ago, and despite her best efforts, she had yet to find a hint of where her sister had taken her ponies. During this time, the moon had hung right where Luna had left it. That was the one thing that gave Celestia hope, Luna still held the moon, thus Celestia could not move it.</p><p class="double">As she thought of her sister, she found herself sitting on her balcony, gazing at the moon. It was because of this, that she noticed the moon start to turn in place. As it turned, her keen alicorn eyesight started to make out something that had previously been hidden on the other side of the moon.</p><p class="double">As she began thinking of how to investigate, a series of bright lights lit up across the moon&#039;s surface, and the moon stopped turning.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Hydroponics, check.</p><p>Atmosphere, check.</p><p>Hab-blocks, check.</p><p>Navigation, check.</p><p>Engines, check.</p><p>Waking up four years before Nightmare Moon? <i>Check.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Your Highness! Braking manoeuvre is complete, rotation successful. Engines standing by.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna had spent the past years setting up to make the moon habitable, building the framework their nation would need. The rest of the moon was simple, compared to the engines. Even with the designs done, and the reactors already built, it had taken the past year to actually build the engines. But they were ready on time, with a full month to spare for system checks.</p><p class="double">&quot;Very well, Engineer.&quot; Luna took off her crown, replacing it with a plumed bicorn. &quot;Pass the word, henceforth I shall be known as Captain. Engage.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with those words, the Moon sailed into history. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">64.8 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Macintosh was going about his routine, absent any distractions or great disturbances. Twilight was off doing something new with (or was it to?) the Griffons, Applebloom and her friends were entertaining themselves with boats off the west coast, and so far as he knew nopony else was Awake. He made his way across one of the Acres&#039; fields, the drag of the plow and strain of his muscles to maintain the motion a familiar, comforting weight. He focused on keeping the furrow straight, each step adjusting his aim to the pull of the fertile soil. There was nothing to watch, no-one to observe. Just him and his chores.</p><p class="double">He might, therefore, be forgiven for not noticing the pegasus until she touched down beside him. The dainty thuds of her hooves on soil got him to pause and look up. He tensed internally, as he couldn&#039;t place her face or cutie-mark in any of the various residents Ponyville cycled through as the Loops added changes. There were a lot of them, but this was a new one on him.</p><p class="double">She was an oddly-colored one too, primarily very dark purple with a white stripe extending from the tip of her snout, between her eyes and what looked like into her mane and along her back as well. The very-not-tribal stylized halberd on her flank and the orientation of the coloration, not to mention her wings, marked her as a pony rather than a zebra but he wouldn&#039;t put such a mistake past some of the Canterlot fops or a few of the residents of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“Hello?”</p><p class="double">Her voice held the promise of authority, but there was something held back about it as well. Playing her cards close to her chest.</p><p class="double">He inclined his head, eyebrow quirked to ask what she wanted, although he could take a guess.</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle told me you have a bar where Loopers can go to cool off. I&#039;d appreciate that.”</p><p class="double">Turned out the guess was correct.</p><p class="double">“Eyup. Give me a minute to finish this, an&#039; ah&#039;l be right with ya.”</p><p class="double">As they made their way towards the storm-doors that opened into the Apple Family&#039;s basement, she shook the dirt off her hooves. He was about to tell her not to bother, the space he used for the bar when it wasn&#039;t a large public establishment was dirty already, but she spoke before he could.</p><p class="double">“Why do you do that?”</p><p class="double">“Do what?”</p><p class="double">“Plow your fields. Surely you know by now how to get that to go faster, even without breaking baseline.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s a routine. Ah&#039;ve always been a pony that lahks things to go smooth. Never been the adventure type. Workin&#039; to help mah family is what ah done for the longest time. Even if they don&#039;t need lookin&#039; after, th&#039; process is still a comfort. One of the nice things about the Loops is th&#039; good don&#039;t need to change less&#039;n ah want it to.”</p><p class="double">He turned a knob and let the gas lamps Applebloom had installed before she left light up the room. The place was small, in no way suited for a clientele larger than twenty ponies, but it kept that homely feel.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;ll ya have?”</p><p class="double">“Do you have any Fuji mountain cider?”</p><p class="double">He grunted. That was a brew from pretty far afield, but this was not the first Looper to have a specific drink in their pony-memories that reminded them of home.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;d y&#039;all say yer name was agin&#039;?”</p><p class="double">“You can call me Rose-Eyes.”</p><p class="double">He nodded, which she took as both affirmation and a prompt.</p><p class="double">“I hold a position of authority, somewhat, in my home loop. The ponies there look up to me, at least in the baseline, and I act as their mentor figure, keeping a firm grip on the situation and trying to steer them to better lives without being too overt. I&#039;m not the anchor though, and one of my students is. They have, obviously, grown beyond needing my help. There are, however, a great many of my subjects that still depend on my guidance.”</p><p class="double">She sighed, and took a long swig of the cider.</p><p class="double">“Sometimes, though, I wonder. Am I doing the right thing? Who am I expect them to pass my tests if I never even tell them I&#039;m watching? They trust me to do my best for them, but there are times I&#039;ve had to keep information from those I am supposed to help, to lead, and sometimes it eats at me. Should I be more blatant, give them better tools, more information to base their decisions on? Or would that simply stifle their growth, leaving them dependent on me?”</p><p class="double">He paused. That was a doozy, to be sure. A leader needed to do many things. Doing those things and remaining visibly the leader and paragon were hard.</p><p class="double">“Well Rose-Eyes, ah&#039;d say yer not bein&#039; a bad person. Fewmets, ah do much the same thing around here, tho&#039; no-pony expects me to lead them.”</p><p class="double">He winced. That wasn&#039;t the most well-considered of remarks. Helping loopers was hard, they remembered your mistakes.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, that was out of turn.”</p><p class="double">She nodded, but it was less a relaxed nod and spoke more of terse acknowledgement. He kept his sigh internal. Talking was difficult when you only had one shot at it. Nothing for it but to forge ahead.</p><p class="double">“From mah perspective though, ah would say the problem is ya mix authority with yer teachin&#039;, an&#039; teachin&#039; with yer authority. Ya got two jobs, one to lead them and show how they should act, and another to make sure they follow through. Seems like the first should lead into the second, an&#039; ifn&#039; they don&#039;t learn by watchin&#039; that&#039;s their fault. Take that&#039;n with a mighty large grain ah salt tho. Ah won&#039;t claim mah wisdom&#039;s the best. Ah&#039;m no Princess Celestia.”</p><p class="double">She smiled, albeit just a little, at that. He could see a small frown trying to pinch at the corner of her eyes though. Rather than leave her with whatever sour thought might be fermenting there, he continued.</p><p class="double">“Mah own sister once said, y&#039; can&#039;t judge somepony by the disasters they avert, even if important stuff woulda been learnt if some hair got burnt. Whether you bein&#039; more free with&#039;n yer information would lead to that or a buncha ponies what can&#039;t think for themselves, ah don&#039;t know. Ah try to adjust what ah put out to get others to make their own conclusions, but mah helpin&#039; sometimes makes new problems. Really all ah&#039;ve found you can do with that is try and do better, or at least different, next time.”</p><p class="double">Maybe it would have been better to hold his tongue. A joke? Something to lighten the mood? This was all like some sort of weird balancing act.</p><p class="double">“Ah don&#039;t believe in inflictin&#039; harm on nopony to &#039;teach them a lesson&#039;. On the other hoof, some ponies will only learn to turn a knob once they stub their nose on the door a couple times. But what do ah know, ah&#039;m just a farmpony moonlightin&#039; as a bartender.”</p><p class="double">This was getting him nowhere. What could he do? Outside of that one loop, which while not blatantly unpleasant he&#039;d rather forget, there really wasn&#039;t much in his experience he could relate. Somepony else&#039;s?</p><p class="double">He ran down a list of the other Loopers he&#039;d had conversations with. None of them had come asking advice on this particular matter, but therapy wasn&#039;t the only thing he catered. He&#039;d have to rely on third or fourth-hoof experience, which was not as useful. </p><p class="double">Well, there was that one story. Twilight Sparkle had once told him about a loop, long ago, where she&#039;d called Princess Celestia herself on just this-</p><p class="double">Wait.</p><p class="double">To his credit, Macintosh did not immediately fall down, prostrate himself, or otherwise align his body more closely with the floor. Instead he tensed, both externally and internally. He tried to school his features, but the mask he&#039;d worn for a long time was best suited for work at a distance. He&#039;d never had to hide from an alicorn from this close a range.</p><p class="double">She sighed.</p><p class="double">“And here I thought my disguise was rather well put together. I even picked someone from another loop to imitate. Macintosh, I&#039;ve told the others they don&#039;t need to bow and scrape to me. That applies to everypony that lives here, even you.”</p><p class="double">He gulped.</p><p class="double">“Eeyup, but that&#039;n don&#039;t account for all th&#039; time ah&#039;ve spent as one of your subjects, yer Highness.”</p><p class="double">Another one of those frown-pinched smiles. Before he could put his foot in it again, she spoke.</p><p class="double">“You don&#039;t swear like the others.”</p><p class="double">He raised an eyebrow. Not needing a prompt, she continued.</p><p class="double">“You say fewmets, or other appellations for things that belong in a restroom, rather than parts of plants.“</p><p class="double">He considered that.</p><p class="double">“Force of habit, ah guess. Never did swear by you, yer Majesty. Woulda been disrespectful before, didn&#039;t see the need to switch.”</p><p class="double">She shook her head.</p><p class="double">“Macintosh, you can dispense with the majesty. You&#039;ve been in my place, more or less. After that, I think we can talk on equal ground.”</p><p class="double">He resisted the urge to stomp a hoof out of frustration, or perhaps just irritation. Bad bar etiquette, not to mention disrespectful.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s what ah&#039;ve been, yer Highness. Not what ah am. Yer still the princess, ah&#039;m still a farmpony.”</p><p class="double">She seemed to consider that for a moment, and then smirked.</p><p class="double">“Then as your princess, I order you to not refer to me as “yer highness” or similar every other sentence.”</p><p class="double">He opened his mouth to protest, and then shut it. He couldn&#039;t think of anything to say to that. Not at the moment. In lieu of thinking, he poured himself a flagon of the Fuji mountain-cider. This was going to be a long one. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">64.9 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Luna Awoke, and was pleased to find herself not on the moon. Instead she found herself in a stately manor with only her young ward Twilight Sparkle and loyal butler Spike. Strange, but much more comfortable than most Loops, she thought to herself.</p><p class="double">Then the Loop memories kicked in, and things became rather less comfortable. A thousand years before Celestia&#039;s penchant for practical jokes had spiraled out of control. In the end Luna had been forced to use the Elements of Harmony to seal her in the sun. Distraught, Luna had abdicated her throne not long after, retiring to a country estate on the slopes of Mount Canter while a new Everfree Republic rose in the new capital of Pony City.</p><p class="double">That retirement had lasted for not quite the full millenium. Celestia had returned as the Solar Troll, an insane criminal mastermind whose crimes revolved around practical jokes. In the meantime the ponies had pretty much forgotten that the reclusive but generous pony on the mountainside had ever ruled the country or raised the sun or moon. Instead she was a frilly socialite, attending charity gatherings, fundraising for worthy causes, and pretending she didn&#039;t keep a sharp eye on the truly vast network of investments and companies Luna possessed.</p><p class="double">All of which was well and good, Luna thought as she reviewed her memories, but what followed next seemed rather silly.</p><p class="double">Silly... but fun.</p><p class="double">A red phone under a serving glass began to flash and ring. Luna levitated the glass up and answered the phone. &quot;Yes, commissioner?... She has? We&#039;ll be right there!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Batpoles?&quot; Twilight Sparkle asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Batpoles, and not a moment to lose!&quot; Luna replied. &quot;The Solar Troll just robbed the Republic&#039;s gold reserves and replaced all the bars with Twinkies!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Holy carbohydrates!&quot; Twilight gasped. &quot;If Pinkie Pie found out, she could devastate the nation&#039;s economy!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just so! To the Batmobile!&quot;</p><p class="double">Moments later, two ponies under disguise enchantments (Luna&#039;s strongly resembling Nightmare Moon) sat in a large black car with an open top.</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna,&quot; Twilight said from the passenger seat, &quot;I think this Loop is going to be hopelessly silly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just so. Final checklist,&quot; Luna said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Reactor online,&quot; Twilight replied. &quot;Batteries at power. Turbines to speed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Roger, prepare to depart,&quot; Luna said, looking over the car&#039;s side to the trio of musicians.</p><p class="double">Vinyl Scratch plugged her guitar into the amp. Octavia&#039;s bass was already plugged in, while a third pony neither of them recognized brought a trumpet to her lips and played a quick riff.</p><p class="double">As the Batmobile blasted off in a squeal of tires and a roar of flame, hard-driving guitar music followed, along with voices singing...</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Batmare!

<p>65.1 (Anowack)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“The Celestial Inquistion declares you guilty,” Twilight Sparkle Awoke saying, “of <i>heresy</i>, and your sins must be cleansed in bloo...”</p><p class="double">The purple unicorn trailed off as her mind caught up with her lips. “What. The. Tree-Forsaken. <i><b>Buck</b></i>.” As if to punctuate the statement, there was a loud clatter as a tray holding various implements Twilight absolutely did not want to think about fell to the stone floor, the soft blue aura that had been supporting it vanished.</p><p class="double">There was a long moment of silence. Dust motes drifted slowly in the shafts of (divine, purifying) sunlight the magical one-way windows let into the torture chamber.</p><p class="double">“Twilight, darling?” The question came from the pony at Twilight&#039;s side, dressed in all-concealing red robes. A junior interrogator under her command, the Loop memories told her.</p><p class="double">“Yes, Rarity?” Twilight answered, using her magic to throw back the hood of her own matching robes, which she had just realized she was wearing.</p><p class="double">“Why are we torture-happy minions of an oppressive theocracy?” Rarity revealed her own face.</p><p class="double">Twilight glared at her. “Not funny,” she said.</p><p class="double">“Did someone create a running gag without me? That&#039;s not very nice!” Twilight looked up to her... victims. Pinkie Pie – who of course had just spoken – and Applejack were chained to the wall, the sunlight shining directly into their magically pried open eyes.</p><p class="double">Fortunately, nothing else had been done to them yet, but Twilight still felt awful as she dismissed the spell.</p><p class="double">“Thank ya kindly,” Applejack drawled, blinking rapidly, and Twilight finally checked, determining that all six Elements were awake, and close by. That made this... well to be honest, she wasn&#039;t sure whether it was less or more awkward. Somehow, her voluminous in-progress research paper <i>A Survey of Applied Friendship In Transfinite Pan-Multiversal Temporal Quasi-Loops</i> did not yet have a chapter on how to handle Awaking in the middle of torturing two of your closest friends.</p><p class="double">“I think Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy are standing guard outside,” Twilight said. “Can you let them in, Rarity?”</p><p class="double">The white unicorn smiled. “Of course, Your Holiness.”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s glare followed her over to the door, and a few minutes later, two black-armored pegasus mares stomped inside. Among it&#039;s many other wonderful features, this Loop&#039;s Equestria apparently enjoyed universal pegasus conscription, and her pre-Loop self had picked the pair out of basic training for her personal retinue.</p><p class="double">As soon as Rarity closed the door behind them, Rainbow Dash turned to Twilight. “So, are we going alicorn revolutionaries on this Loop, or what?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy took the air and started unchaining Applejack and Pinkie Pie, making Twilight wince briefly as she realized she hadn&#039;t gotten around to that yet. “Maybe,” she said after a moment. “Give me a minute to think and let my Loop memories finish settling.”</p><p class="double">Applejack snorted as she got loose and fell to the floor. “What&#039;s to think about?”</p><p class="double">“Well, for one,” Twilight answered, “Even if she turns out to not be Awake, Celestia is actually sane and not evil this Loop, so we won&#039;t need to fight her.”</p><p class="double">“Then I fear I must repeat my prior question,” Rarity said. “<i>Why</i> are we torture-happy minions -”</p><p class="double">“Of an oppressive theocracy,” Twilight said, “yes.”</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re all ears,” Applejack said.</p><p class="double">Pinkie wormed her way free of her chains before Fluttershy could finish with the last manacle. “I&#039;ve been all ears,” she said as she landed beside Applejack. “It&#039;s less fun than it sounds.” Twilight decided she did not want to know about that, nor why Fluttershy was <i>nodding in agreement</i>.</p><p class="double">“Okay, long story short,” Twilight said, “Nightmare Moon hit Celestia with a nasty spell before being banished, which left her all but in a coma for most of the past thousand years. The unicorns who&#039;ve been helping her keep the sun and moon moving mostly on schedule have been running the show, and she&#039;s been too weak to tear down this whole rotten, tribalist edifice.”</p><p class="double">“Lovely,” Rarity murmured. “Shall we start tearing it down for her, then?”</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled slightly. “Let&#039;s adjourn to my office,” she said. “I have a plan. I wonder if Chrysalis is Awake... hmm, well, either way the first step is to come up with ninety-five theses to nail to Grand Inquisitor Blueblood&#039;s door.”</p><p class="double">Everypony looked at her blankly. “Oh come on,” Twilight complained. “It&#039;s <i>funny</i>. You have to get it. We&#039;ve all been through Earth high school at least a hundred times. ”</p><p class="double">“Yeah,” Rainbow Dash replied, “but you&#039;re the only one who <i>enjoys </i>that stuff.Let&#039;s just ascend and kick flank until the world makes sense again.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, fine,” Twilight grumbled. “If we want to do this the boring way...” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;d like to sign up please!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack and Rainbow Dash turned to the three little fillies, smiling beautifully and wearing necklaces. They shared a look.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, how do I put this?&quot; Rainbow Dash crossed her forelegs. &quot;It&#039;s an iron <i>pony</i> competition, and as awesome as you three are you&#039;re still kinda minipones.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey! We can be iron ponies!&quot; Scootaloo protested.</p><p class="double">Applejack sighed. &quot;Look, girls, Ah get that yer confident. But Ah don&#039;t want ta see ya&#039;ll hurt in a competition with older ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom pushed her bow back. &quot;Oh, believe me, we&#039;ll be perfectly fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You and Scoots, maybe,&quot; Rainbow Dash allowed, &quot;but Sweetie Belle?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn rolled her eyes. &quot;Suuuuuure, I&#039;m frilly so I <i>must</i> be weak.&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack snorted. &quot;That&#039;s not what she meant. Listen, you can have yer own competition, but nothing ya&#039;ll can say could possibly change our opinion on this.&quot;</p><p class="double">A wide grin appeared on each of the filly&#039;s faces. Then, almost as one, their necklaces began to glow.</p><p class="double">After a few moments, the transformation was complete. The three armored ponies looked upon the two shocked athletes and waited patiently for a response.</p><p class="double">&quot;....when... when we said iron ponies,&quot; Rainbow finally managed, &quot;we didn&#039;t.... mean it literally.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.3 (Scizorstrike)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke sitting in a library, reading book detailing the imprisonment of a pony in the moon a thousand years ago.</p><p class="double">Said pony was not normally called Monstrous Eye, and was not normally “Cursed to have her appearance reflect her true self”. This could be something as simple as a variant Loop, or it could be a fused Loop.</p><p class="double">Twilight, student of Lady Palutena, blinked as her Loop memories came in. Well, that answered <i>that</i> question.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The clearly Awake Palutena had, quite cheerily, sent “backup” in the form of her just-as-clearly Awake Captain of the Guard- Who was, for a change, not Shining Armour, who Loop memories indicated as being a mercenary of some kind out in the far east.</p><p class="double">“I have to say,” Dug Hole (Or, as he preferred to be called, Pit) mused as he and Twilight walked into the library. “I’ve been a pegasus before but this is the first time I’ve been a <i>yellow</i> pegasus.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. All four pony forms were natural to her now.</p><p class="double">“Not the weirdest thing I’ve been, by a long shot.”</p><p class="double">“That’s something I think every Looper can agree on.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The appearance of Monstrous Eye, mane of snakes hissing at full volume, at the Summer Sun celebration caused immediate panic, and posthaste evacuation of every single non-Looper pony in the building- Quite a feat, as this included Unawake versions of the other Elements of Harmony. Twilight herself had felt a surge of absolute terror, before she recognized the effects of the enchantment and brushed it aside.</p><p class="double">Pit seemed unaffected by the terror field, and met the gaze of Monstrous Eye’s single… Well, eye.</p><p class="double">“Medusa,” he greeted, not <i>quite</i> calmly, but close to it. “How long have you been Awake?”</p><p class="double">The darkness swirled around Medusa’s body, and faded to reveal a much more normal alicorn form. “Since the beginning of the Loop, of course,” She examined herself curiously. “I have to say, Goddess of the moon is definitely an improvement over my <i>usual</i> job…”</p><p class="double">The Pegasus noticeably relaxed. “That’s good. Most of my weapons aren’t made for quadrupedal bodies,”</p><p class="double">Twilight let herself relax as well.</p><p class="double">“<i>I had been wondering about that,” </i>Palutena’s mental voice echoed over the room. “<i>The person you’re replacing would normally have at least done </i>something <i>to me.”</i></p><p class="double">“Well, that’s not <i>quite</i> true.” Medusa grinned, a grin which showed <i>entirely</i> too many teeth. “I <i>did </i>take the time to go through your castle’s treasury to… re-appropriate some of the more esoterich items there.”</p><p class="double">“<i>I’m pretty sure that’s not how you say that,”</i> the Sun goddess opined.</p><p class="double">“Silence.” The darker alicorn pulled a large, ornate mirror out from her Subspace Pocket, and angled it at Pit. “Now, I believe you have an appointment with the Mirror of Truth…”</p><p class="double">The mirror flashed once, and dropped a dark mirror image of the white pegasus onto the ground.</p><p class="double">“Pittoo!” Pit greeted cheerfully.</p><p class="double">“Don’t call me that,” was the instant response, though it had a rehearsed air to it that indicated it was more out of habit than any real vitriol toward the name. The jet-black pony took a single step forward, and immediately collapsed to the ground. “…Pit.”</p><p class="double">“Yes Pittoo?”</p><p class="double">“Why am I quadrupedal?”</p><p class="double">“Because I am?”</p><p class="double">Twilight felt a headache coming on. This was going to be a <i>long</i> Loop. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.4 (Scygnus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, pushing the hat off of her head with a grumble and almost sliding off the chair sideways onto the floor before regaining her balance. Her eyes slid over the dials of her vessel, remembering a number of loops that started with exploding engines, but it seemed everything was-</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity?&quot; Twilight shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Twilight?&quot; Rarity ceased her rocking out for a moment, turning the volume down and looking speculatively at the bag in her hands.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are we flying through space in a winnebago?&quot;</p><p class="double">The white pikanese Wog (half woman, half dog, all fabulous) checked her loop memories.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes dear, it seems we are.&quot; Rarity shrugged and popped a treat into her mouth, shrugging again at the taste and heading for the cockpit.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh good. I was worried I was hallucinating. Um, incoming hail. I think you... Audio only, Rarity, please.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right, it&#039;s... this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hello Lone Star.&quot; The video screen greeted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot; Rarity blushed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, um, Vinnie. What do you want?&quot; Twilight quickly began running through her loop memories, didn&#039;t need any supr-</p><p class="double">&quot;Nonononono.&quot; The mechanical man twitched, &quot;It&#039;s not what I want. It&#039;s what HE wants...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;PIZZA THE HUTT!?&quot; Chorused the two displaced ponies. They shared a glance, and then simultaneously facepalmed.</p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m thinking this loop may be entirely too silly.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;No. No. No. No. No.&quot; Diamond Tiara recited, walking away from the altar and Prince Blueblood as fast as her dress would allow, her faithful white and lavender-pink robomaid (the traitor was holding back laughter) following behind her, &quot;Prepare to blow this popsicle stand.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Preparing to blow this popsicle stand.&quot; Sweetie recited.</p><p class="double">&quot;Blow this popsicle stand.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Blowing this popsicle stand.&quot; Sweetie replied, amused even as she revved up the Mercedes&#039; engines and threw the two of them into the atmosphere and beyond. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.5 (Scygnus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, screaming. She paused to let the loop memories filter in... and then continued screaming.</p><p class="double">Apparently, in a fit of idiocy, she&#039;d left her jacket with her father&#039;s watch inside a dangerous test chamber designed to separate objects from the intrinsic fields... whatever the bark that meant exactly, as she didn&#039;t have time to debate the loop&#039;s technobabble while the loops of alloy around her heated up to... probably tear her apart at the molecular level, if she had to guess. She took the logical path of screaming at the door in hopes that someone would unlock it and let her out while trying to access her magic... Nope. Pocket? Nope, though that seemed to be a property of the room rather than the loop.</p><p class="double">It wasn&#039;t that she hadn&#039;t died before. She&#039;d done that quite a lot actually. And with her waking up in almost certain danger of dying, this was probably one of those loops with odd and varied definitions of death anyway. But dying was something she tried to avoid as a general rule. It hurt. All for naught, it seemed, as the scientist outside delivered the bad news. With a sigh, she leaned against the door and resolved herself to-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Well. This was curious. She had indeed been torn apart at the molecular level. But she wasn&#039;t dead. Somehow. She was all there, but disconnected. She couldn&#039;t really see anything, but she could sense the molecular structure of everything around her. Not that this told her anything about what was going on around her. It was like looking through the eyes of a million flies at once, too much complexity to make sense of. But she could sense herself. And she could move herself. And... any of the other molecules, as it turned out. She thought she might even be able to see the atomic level if she squinted. She refrained from mucking about with it though, for now, and just tried to pull herself together.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three months after the tragic death of Dr. Sparkle, the ghosts began appearing. A brain in the bathroom. A circulatory system in the kitchen. Bones and some muscle in the courtyard.</p><p class="double">The scientists could be forgiven for not recognizing a resemblance, since the late Dr. Sparkled hadn&#039;t been quadrupedal.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">This was harder than Twilight had thought it would be. Without all the components in the right place, the structure came right apart again. But she thought she finally had it right this time.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Finally, in the break room, a full body appeared... a be-winged, horned equine, glowing purple, its solid white eyes looking around with curiosity. Truthfully, Twilight was just glad to be able to see again and put names to the collections of atoms she&#039;d been looking at all this time. Eventually, her focus turned to the people in the room, looking at her with fear and curiosity.</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... hi?&quot; She tried.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was several days later that she got a moment to herself to pull out her PADD and look up this place in her HUB fiction collection.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeeeeenope. Well, wouldn&#039;t be the first time I&#039;ve brought about world peace.&quot; She mused, &quot;Making friends with the Russians should cut off Viedt before he gets started.&quot; She&#039;d already replaced the payload of all the nuclear weapons in the world with custard, whipped cream, or marzipan, as the mood struck her, pretty standard procedure when she had the juice for it. &quot;A helping hoof to a few key players, get Walter Kovacs to a healthy home of some kind... I should make sure he gets his face though, at least. Other than that, just a big heap of socio-political engineering. Yipee.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight willed the components of the Perpetual Energy Generator to little flourishes as she put them together. Well, maybe it was a <i>little</i> fun, having power not incomparable to Discord&#039;s but... much more sciency. And they let her research whatever she wanted! She might even turn that weird past-present-future vision back on and study it, if she could do it without being driven bonkers from do/did/will. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.6 (Inkweaver22)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie waited in the shadows as the bear wearing yellow shorts and a blue backpack entered the tent shaped like her pointed hat. Her loop memories informed her that she was replacing a shamaness that used her transfiguration magic to help the local heroes.</p><p class="double">&quot;Erm, anyone home?&quot; Called out the bird that was riding in the bear&#039;s pack. Smoke began to fill the tent and the lights dimmed. Stirring music played for a moment before with a bright flash, Trixie appeared on her chair in front of the magic pool.</p><p class="double">&quot;Welcome to the home of the Great and Powerful Trixie Wixie! I, using my stupendous skills in transfiguration, shall assist you in your noble quest!&quot; Fireworks went off behind her. It wasn&#039;t often that the show mare got to perform for a new audience, so she sold it for all it&#039;s worth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. A pony. That&#039;s... Strange.&quot; The bear said after a moment, earning an annoyed huff from the unicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, strange was that one time when we were all talking fruits and vegetables.&quot; The bird countered. &quot;This is pretty much normal for us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trixie assumes that you are both loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Loopers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Stuck in a time loop.&quot; The mare clarified.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Yeah! Wait, does that mean you are too Miss Trixie?&quot; The bear asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. I&#039;ll also assume this is your first fused loop?&quot; She received a hesitant nod. &quot;Oh good! I&#039;ve been meaning to try out some new material. Those slideshows are so <i>boring</i>.&quot; Trixie&#039;s horn lit up. &quot;Now, watch in awe as the secrets of time, space, and the multi-verse are revealed to you!&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie and the two loopers, Banjo and Kazooie, watched in awe as her hat-shaped tent burned to the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;I think you might have overdid it with the fireworks.&quot; Banjo said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nonsense! One can never have too many explosives!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Remind me to not show her Grenade Eggs.&quot; Kazooie murmured. Unfortunately, she was overheard.</p><p class="double">&quot;Grenade... Eggs? Trixie has not yet experimented with this concept yet.&quot; A shiver ran down the bear and bird&#039;s spines as a feeling of impending doom filled them.</p><p class="double">&quot;You mentioned a slideshow?&quot; Banjo quickly interrupted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah yes. I suppose it&#039;ll have to do until I perfect my technique.&quot; She reached into her mane and pulled out a projector, causing the other two to blink. &quot;Once we&#039;re through you&#039;ll have to show me these wondrous eggs of yours.&quot;</p><p class="double">Dread filled them as Banjo&#039;s distraction failed. They watched the presentation without interruption, wondering what kind of trouble they just caused and silently begged forgiveness for it. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.7 (Dalxein, Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Apple Bloom? What are you...?&quot; Twilight started. The two were apparently replacing &#039;The Ponds&#039; or something. Though that made no sense, since their canonical &#039;daughter&#039; was still running around and... she shook her head to fight off a headache. No use making sense of the Whoverse, that&#039;s why it was Read-Only.</p><p class="double">This brought her back to the filly in front of her, surrounded by bits and bobs, wires and tech, that she&#039;d scrounged from the TARDIS. &quot;I&#039;m learning how to build a sonic screwdriver.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn shook her head. &quot;But it&#039;s a Read-Only loop. This sort of technology-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not if I build it myself after we leave!&quot;</p><p class="double">An incredulous head-tilt. &quot;That isn&#039;t going to-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Yes it will!</i>&quot; The younger mare snapped.</p><p class="double">Twilight decided to leave the filly be. She <i>really</i> liked The Doctor&#039;s Deus Ex Matchstick. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight examined Applebloom&#039;s newly completed &quot;Sonic Screwdriver&quot;. It was a kludge of magic and technology, which, while not quite anything like &quot;The&quot; Sonic Screwdriver, was impressve in its own way.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lets see here, you attached a tricorder, an omnitool, a matter manipulator, a Rod of Lordly Might, and that&#039;s an impressive amount of duct tape you&#039;ve got there.&quot; said Twilight as she ran her eyes up and down the device.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, its just a proof of concept. I&#039;m going to field test it with Sweetie and Scootaloo and then refine it when I&#039;m done.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.8&nbsp;&nbsp;(Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><b><hr></b></p><p class="double"><b>Looper Conference, Part 1</p><p></b>At first, this looped seemed similar to the other adventures in Elder Tales, awakening in front of his computer with hours to spare before the Novasphere Pioneer update would activate. First thing he did was message Akatsuki with the pre-determined awake signal. Sometimes, they would start as new characters (Akatsuki as female every time), others they would meet up and explore the real world Japan. Their loop varied in length, lasting up to a year in game, but in real life that translated to 30 days. </p><p class="double">The two had just about decided to start new characters when an email appeared on his screen from an unknown account. Curious, since he had never received an email the day prior to the update, he opened it. Unconsciously, his mouth curved into a cheerful grin, returning a reply immediately, <i>Bring your entire guild to the Akibahara server and make sure everyone is online at midnight</i>. </p><p class="double">With that out of the way, he messaged Akatsuki that they would have to start new players another time, sending the appearance changing formula along with the message. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Akihabara Server, The Day of the Apocalypse</p><p class="double">Almost immediately, Shiroe knew something had changed. Some of the adventurers he ran into were a lot more relaxed than those who were unawake...like they had lived through stranger things. A couple of the out of place adventurers were taking charge, giving orders and returning purpose to those not awake. As strange as that was, it was not a concern at the moment. He was meeting with a foreign guild. </p><p class="double">There was no mistaking them for a second, as their race didn&#039;t exist in the baseline Elder Tales. In this loop, it was an update exclusive to America, created by petition due to the popularity of a local tv show, or so his loop memories told him. However since the expansion wasn&#039;t widely used, it wasn&#039;t released in other countries. </p><p class="double">Several noticed his arrival. The anchor must have fulfilled his request to the letter since there were non-awake characters mixed in with the loopers. It was blindingly obvious who was asleep since they were far more nervous. Those asleep were far more nervous and shrank back at his approach. But their nerves decreased as their guild leader walked forward with a big smile on her face. They were about to greet one another when a pink haired girl just...appeared in front of him and gave a deep hug, &quot;Shiroe-chan, it&#039;s been so long well not so long since loops here are so short but our loops are longer by quite a bit and we have other loops in longer loops but I&#039;m here again and get to see mybestfriendinElderTalesweshouldthrowapartywith-&quot;</p><p class="double">The guild leader looked at the Pink haired girl disapprovingly, &quot;Pinkie, I&#039;m glad your excited, but please let him up for a moment.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie bobbed her head, &quot;Ok,&quot; and released the enchanter. Shiroe chuckled, &quot;Good to see you too Pinkie. Hello, Twilight Sparkle. Been awhile since Hogwarts.&quot;</p><p class="double">The leader of the Lunar Republic, Twilight Sparkle, gave a big grin of her own, &quot;Come on! Let me introduce you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shiroe&#039;s eyes danced above each adventurers. Each one had a name, race, class and subclass along with their level number:</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Sorcerer</p><p>Lv. 90 Scholar (Looper)</p><p class="double">Pinkamena &quot;Pinkie&quot; Pie</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Bard</p><p>Lv. 90 Chef (Looper)</p><p class="double">The Enchanter remembered their previous discussion on Equestria, Putting names to faces. In addition to a pony like tail, each Equine Tail had a unique feature to their type, the earth types having their ears replaced with horse ears and their feet replaced with hooves. </p><p class="double">Applejack</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Monk</p><p>Lv. 90 Farmer (Looper)</p><p class="double">Some of the guild members had wings like the pegasus of legend:</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Monk</p><p>Lv. 90 Knight (Looper)</p><p class="double">Fluttershy</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Summoner</p><p>Lv. 90 Animal Trainer (Looper)</p><p class="double">Even more had Unicorn horns on their head:</p><p class="double">Rarity Belle</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Shaman</p><p>Lv. 90 Tailor (Looper)</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Bard</p><p>Lv. 90 Dancer (Looper)</p><p class="double">But the final two were something else altogether with both wings and a horn:</p><p class="double">Luna Equis</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Bard</p><p>Lv. 90 Sigil Maker (Looper)</p><p class="double">Celestia Equis</p><p>Equine Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Enchanter</p><p>Lv. 90 Aristocrat (Looper)</p><p class="double">They were, without a doubt, the princesses of Equestria. The wind kicked up, tugging at the hem of Shiroe&#039;s robe as he gave a low bow, &quot;My princesses, let me be the first to welcome you to the Elder Tales loops.&quot; </p><p class="double">Luna rolled her eyes, &quot;Please arise, Enchanter Shiroe. We ask that you do not bow in our presence, nor that any looper do the same.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia chuckled, &quot;Yes, we get enough of that at home from those who are not awake. Besides, you are not one of our subjects, nor are we princesses in this world.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shiroe chuckled, &quot;Of course, my ladies. If I may inquire about your unique species? The Japanese servers do not have the option to become Equine Tail. What abilities do you hold?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight fielded this question, &quot;Equine Tails have several polarizing advantages and disadvantages. We have higher magical reserves and the ability to shapeshift into our pony form. However since equines have a herd mindset, the fewer we are in number, the easier we are to panic and the lower our defense will be. Furthermore, we are not naturally a fighting race, so our attack strength with weapons based classes are reduced as well.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, she shifted into her pony form, then back to half human, half equine. Shiroe sighed, &quot;Sounds like a difficult species to play.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;In America, we&#039;re commonly mages due to our high magical reserves. Our race also allows us to play as Monks without reductions to our attacking stats. Finally, we countered the penalty to our defense by always fighting in groups.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm...&quot; Shiroe muttered to himself. While they talked, the non awake players wondered off, trying to get a feel for the moss covered, forested city of Akiba. Their talk, though, ended when Akatsuki appeared in the middle of their group on one knee in front of Shiroe. It showed just how much these loopers had been through that none of them, not even Fluttershy, blinked at her arrival. </p><p class="double">&quot;Akatsuki, you shouldn&#039;t just appear in the middle of groups like this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Forgive me, Shiroe, but have you checked your friends list recently?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shiroe&#039;s menu opened a second later and the friend list took up most of the screen. The list scrolled down as Shiroe read name after name. The first name he noticed was Maryelle&#039;s...or more appropriately where Maryelle should have been. It had been replaced by another name, one he didn&#039;t immediately recognize until he called upon his loop memories. As he scrolled down, several names had been replaced by others. </p><p class="double">He needed to figure out what was going on, so he sent a call out to Maryelle&#039;s replacement.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So you are the Anchor of this loop,&quot; asked Maryelle&#039;s replacement. Shiroe was unsure how to act beyond nodding. Part of what made him speechless was their guild hall. They had entered the main guild building and then travelled to the replacement&#039;s guild room, located in the same spot as Maryelle&#039;s. It was like they had opened the door to another dimension altogether, a forested dimension with a single oak tree with pavilions attached on all sides. There was a river flowing on one side of the massive tree and countless wood and hay huts surrounding the previous pavilions. This was not in Shiroe&#039;s loop memories. </p><p class="double">&quot;Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Sally Acorn, guildmaster of the Underground.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sally Acorn</p><p>Fox Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Shaman</p><p>Lv. 90 Aristocrat (Looper)</p><p class="double">Surrounding her were members of her Loop. He only recognized two by name:</p><p class="double">Sonic Hedgehog</p><p>Werecat</p><p>Lv. 90 Monk</p><p>Lv. 90 Tracker (Looper)</p><p class="double">Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prowler</p><p>Foxtail</p><p>lv. 90 Swashbuckler</p><p>Lv. 90 Mechanic (Looper)</p><p class="double">He pushed his glasses to the bridge of his nose. If Crescent Moon was replaced by Underground, it was possible that other guilds had been replaced as well, and he could be hosting a lot of extra loopers. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.9</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, this is most overdue,” Princess Luna noted. “I had heard of such loops from several of your cohort, and was wondering if there was some criterion I did not fulfil.”</p><p class="double">Her sister, Princess Twilight, shrugged. “Apparently not. Any choice on which Elements you take?”</p><p class="double">“Well, magic is yours...” Luna nodded. “I think mayhap I shall take Honesty, alongside Laughter and Kindness. Dost this work for you?”</p><p class="double">“...you really don&#039;t need to do the whole archaic speech thing, Luna.” Twilight picked up the two necklaces and slipped them on her wings. “Right, I assume you know how to use these.”</p><p class="double">“You assume correctly.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, job done,” Twilight said with a smile. “That went a lot more smoothly than normal.”</p><p class="double">“It went rather more smoothly than it did the first time Celestia and I faced the chaotic one. Far be it from me to suggest Celly was perhaps less experienced at the use of the elements then than you are now, but...” Luna trailed off.</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “You&#039;re suggesting it, all right. Okay, what now?”</p><p class="double">“Are you comfortable with handling the day?” Luna asked. “I am most experienced with the night, but...”</p><p class="double">“Actually, I had an idea. What about this – if the moon is in the sky, you&#039;re in charge. And we move things so the lunar cycle is about four days. If my mental calculations are right, that puts us at a schedule of sixteen hours each, moving around the calendar.” Twilight cast a spell on a nearby plant, turning it into a sky chart. “Does that make sense?”</p><p class="double">Luna perused the paper. “It seems to hold together.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, we wanted interesting proposals...” Twilight said absently, holding up the document to the light.</p><p class="double">There were diagrams. There were scribbled notes in spidery handwriting. There was a cost-benefit analysis that seemed to assume that having the moon permanently looming overhead was “cool”.</p><p class="double">And there was an <i>approved</i> stamp in the deep blue ink of Luna&#039;s personal seal.</p><p class="double">“Oh, well. In for a bit, in for... a lot... of bits.” Twilight shrugged, and slapped her own personal seal on next to Luna&#039;s one.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had taken ten years to get this far.</p><p class="double">First, the moon had been moved into a geostationary orbit, so it neither rose nor set. That had been relatively easy, though working out a truly stable position for an object that large had been somewhat nerve-wracking and resulted in three months of Twilight trying to solve the three-body problem, before giving up and using a computer simulator.</p><p class="double">Step two had involved importing a substantial amount of extra atmosphere. That had entailed setting up a cracking plant on a convenient out-system satellite, increasing the partial nitrogen pressure, and moderating the oxygen level increase to avoid causing medical problems.</p><p class="double">After a roche limit calculation had come up at nearly a thousand kilometres surface-surface distance, Twilight had resorted to magically increasing the apparent density of the entire moon with a series of Epic grade spells. (A dovin basal would have been easier, but she didn&#039;t have one.) And Luna had only mumbled a little about “ruining the purity of the exercise”.</p><p class="double">And finally, the moon had had an atmosphere of equal density to the current Equestrian one added.</p><p class="double">Tonight, however, was the moment of truth.</p><p class="double">“Ready?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Luna nodded.</p><p class="double">Together, their horns lit. And the moon began to slowly approach.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Phew,” Twilight said, some hours later, as the spell locking the moon in place finally engaged. “That took a lot more care than I was expecting.”</p><p class="double">“We had some margin,” Luna replied. “But indeed, &#039;tis much easier to be blasé about moving the moon with five hundred thousand kilometres under it than merely five hundred all told.”</p><p class="double">They looked up at the huge white circle obscuring much of the sky.</p><p class="double">“Did we get it right?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Luna squinted upwards. “It seems a few pegasi have already decided to test our hoofiwork...”</p><p class="double">As they watched, a dozen or so bright-coated pegasi winged their way steadily upwards, into the atmosphere no thicker than sea level on a normal loop. Then further, into thinner air... and then, after almost an hour of high-speed climb, they spun for a moment and began to dive.</p><p class="double">Towards the moon.</p><p class="double">“Yes!” Twilight cheered. “We <i>did</i> get it working!”</p><p class="double">Luna nodded, smiling. “The Lunar Air Bridge is done. Fine work, Twilight Sparkle.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Now, space elevator time! Well, lunar-vator.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Was that my normal sister I saw leaving?” Luna asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Yes, that&#039;s right.” Twilight smiled after the door Celestia had left out of. “I asked her to set up an observatory on the antequestria side of the moon, because that way she&#039;ll get more sun – she likes the sun.”</p><p class="double">“So, she is your student?” Luna nodded to herself. “I wonder if I might be able to track down Cadence...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.10 (Ghrathryn)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Waking up in her bedroom in her family cottage wasn’t unusual, nor was waking up to not find her dog there given their usual loop start had him being kept by neighbours. What was odd this time was the fact that she was a bipedal, bat-winged horse, her usual curly dark hair replaced by a slightly longer dark mane.</p><p class="double">“Pony fused loop of some kind?” The young girl wondered aloud. It wouldn’t be the first time she had ended up as an anthropomorphised creature, and she had heard there were looping ponies. She needed to talk to her mother about who her cousins were, since most likely the only way the loop would end up like this was if one or more of them had been replaced given they were the main group, and she couldn&#039;t feel their presence in her mind at the moment.</p><p class="double"><i>:Timmy,:</i> She Reached out with her mind, grabbing some clothes from the wardrobe and snorting to herself when she found they were already adapted to her body form. Even without Loop Memories, she could tell that anthro-ponies weren’t going to be unusual this time out. How would it affect their tastes though? The amount of ginger beer they got through, not to mention ham and other things, as humans would probably be unreal for ponies.</p><p class="double">At least her clothes were still boyish. She had hated some of the loops where she had been a girly-girl.</p><p class="double"><i>:Yes George?:</i> The voice still sounded masculine, and he still knew her name, meaning <i>he</i> was still ‘normal’, for a given definition of the word.</p><p class="double">Pulling her clothes on, she glanced out the window, towards the old island her family owned. <i>:Can you meet me at home? I think we’ve got some type of fusion with that pony loop, but I need to check with Mom first.:</i></p><p class="double">There was a mental snort of amusement from Timmy. <i>:I had noticed. It seems every human is now a pony, though I’m still a dog.:</i></p><p class="double"><i>:Yes but you’re also able to become something else after that loop we got </i>this <i>trick in.:</i> George pointed out, heading downstairs to find her mother and father outside, her father flying around. “Is Dad trying to learn how things fly through doing things himself, Mom?” She asked, approaching the pale grey mare.</p><p class="double">“It looks like it, George.” Her mother replied, turning to look at her. “Are you staying here this time or going off with Timothy?”</p><p class="double">“I was planning on staying here, since it is likely at least one of my cousins isn’t my cousin.” George replied, looking up at her father. It was obvious she got her wings from her mother, but her dark mane was straight from her father. “Do you remember who they are?” She asked.</p><p class="double">Her mother frowned for a moment. “Rayne, Lauren and Felicity Kirrin, all girls,” Her tail twitched. “I think all three have been replaced this time.” She added as a large dog bounded up the path to be hugged by George. “Hello Timothy,” Crouching down, she rubbed the dog’s ears.</p><p class="double">George nodded, frowning slightly. Where had Julian, Dick and Anne ended up if all three of them were replaced this time out? Wherever they were, she silently wished them luck and good adventures, since their normal run was getting a bit stale, particularly since they could pretty much skip the first two simply due to knowing where things were and what they needed for school.</p><p class="double"><i>:You’re thinking too hard,:</i> Timmy said, licking her face. <i>:They will be fine, even little Anne can be as fierce as a lion if the situation calls for it.:</i></p><p class="double">“I know, Tim, but it’s still hard thinking they’re out there while I’m here with little new happening.”</p><p class="double">Her mother smiled slightly, ruffling her mane. “Don’t worry, George, you’ll get your adventures. Why don’t you and Timothy go down to the bay for a while? If things go as they usually do, as long as you’re back for dinner, you will meet your cousins today.” She looked up and winced as her husband ended up ploughing into the ground. “And I had better make sure your father is alright.” She said, getting up to see to her husband.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">She hadn’t been sure what she was expecting her ‘cousins’ to be, but the fact they were all bird-winged like her father made sense, after all her uncle was her father’s brother. The colours on the other hand, those were somewhat strange. Both Rayne and her father seemed to have rainbow coloured manes, while her aunt’s was a rich blue, leaving her no clue as to how the girl she guessed was Felicity had <i>pink</i> for her mane colour, nor the amber-blonde of Lauren’s mane. Her father wasn’t focused on biology, but she had picked up enough to know that normally things ran in families.</p><p class="double">Dropping down to land, she back-winged and settled gently on the ground near Kirrin Cottage before walking up to stand near her mother, watching her cousins’ replacements get things out of the car.</p><p class="double">“Hi,” Rayne said, walking up to the two of them. “Are you Georgina?”</p><p class="double">George grimaced, looking up at her mother. “Did you <i>have</i> to tell them my full name, Mom?” She asked. “I prefer George, thank you very much.” She replied to Rayne. “I take it that you’re Rayne and that you know about loops.”</p><p class="double">Rayne nodded. “Yeah,” She twitched a wing, “Though I can honestly say I’ve never been to this one before.”</p><p class="double">“That might be because we haven’t been going <i>that</i> long, dear.” George’s mother answered. “I’m Fanny Kirrin, and yes I do know how that can be taken. This is Georgina, though as she said, she prefers George. Quentin is in the house, resting off a rather unfortunate incident.”</p><p class="double">George rolled her eyes. “Dad flubbed a landing and ploughed the garden with his nose.” She translated.</p><p class="double">After getting everyone settled and fed, and Timmy returning to meet the new (to their loop) Loopers. George sat on the floor, leaning against her dog, the others in chairs. “Alright, as I said earlier, I’m George and I’m one of the local loopers. So far there’s eight I know about, maybe another one or two elsewhere. We’ve had the talk about the multiverse, which is why we’re <i>not</i> that worried about the whole fact we’re anthro-ponies.</p><p class="double">“I’m not entirely sure who our anchor is, I would have thought it would be Julian, my older cousin, but given I’m here and looping while he isn’t, it might be me or Timmy.” She shrugged her wings. “Normally speaking this loop lasts around seven to eight years, most of which is school for us.” She grimaced at that. “However holidays are usually interesting, mainly because we have adventures during them.”</p><p class="double">Rayne nodded. “I know,” She said, reaching into the air and pulling a slim book out. “We stocked up the last time we landed a hub loop, just in case we ended up somewhere new.”</p><p class="double">“Do the other series that Mrs. Blyton wrote work in the same universe?” Felicity asked.</p><p class="double">“You know, I don’t think we’ve checked. It would make sense, but I think at one point one of the boys had a book about the Seven, so either it’s not or they come in before us.” George shrugged, looking up at her mother.</p><p class="double">“We can always check, since this is unlikely to be a base loop.” Fanny said, frowning slightly. “It’s not as if we need to worry about the wreck being thrown up or having to sell the island since we’ve had several loops of gathering that bullion.”</p><p class="double">George nodded. “That’s true, and that’s usually our first adventure, and with Dad putting things in a really complex code now, we don’t need to worry too much about the three thugs this Christmas time either.” She frowned, twitching her tail. “What about you three, what’s ‘normal’ for you?”</p><p class="double">Rayne shifted slightly. “Well, I normally go by Rainbow Dash, Felicity is normally Fluttershy, both of us are Loopers from Equestria. Lauren <i>isn’t</i> a Looper, normally she goes by Lightning Dust and she doesn’t normally come into our story until I go to the Wonderbolt’s Academy. Normally we’re quadrupedal, but we’ve been looping for a while so we’ve had a few times when we’ve been bipedal. I think Lauren’s been working off in loop memories, meaning she’s probably not going to think outside the box too often.”</p><p class="double">“You said we were replacing your cousins?” Lauren asked, curiously. Obviously trying to follow the conversation even if she didn’t know most of what it was about.</p><p class="double">George nodded. “Julian, Dick and Anne. Normally I meet them tomorrow and the first few times it didn’t go well since they knew me as Georgina. This holiday we normally end up spending time on Kirrin Island, investigating the wreck of my grandfather’s ship when a storm throws it up onto the rocks near the island. I can probably force that storm myself now, thanks to a ‘game loop’ where a number of people ended up as dragons when magic came back. Timmy was ‘human’ that loop so we ended up with telepathy between the five of us.</p><p class="double">“Anyway, once we get the document box from the wreck we find out the gold it was carrying is in a dungeon, one that’s under the castle on the island. Getting hold of that pretty much fixes our financial problems; otherwise we would have had to sell the island.” George shifted again. “We can probably ignore it since we’ve already got a few loops’ worth, plus other things we’ve picked up. I can’t remember off hand what else there is we get into, but there’s a number of times we come across spies or other things. Actually, I need to see if I can grab Jo when she shows up. She’s probably going to either be disgusted as heck or will want Lauren regardless. I’m hoping she’ll tone it down to sibling rather than lover since she has been up there the last couple of loops.”</p><p class="double">“Jo?” Lauren asked, her ears perking up. “Should I be worried?”</p><p class="double">“Not really, I know how to deal with her.”</p><p class="double"><i>:We </i>both <i>know how to deal with young Jo, normally, George.:</i> Timmy cut in as Felicity yawned.</p><p class="double">Fanny nodded slightly. “Well, I don’t know how old you three are normally, but if you’re starting to yawn, it’s probably time you all went to bed. We can continue this tomorrow and George can show you the town and bay.” She frowned. “If your wings work as well here as they do normally, she can probably show you the island as well.”</p><p class="double">George rolled her eyes at her mother before getting to her feet. “Come on, I’ll show you where Julian, Dick and Anne sleep.” She said, Timmy getting up behind her as she started out of the room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Looking up at the clouds overhead, the dark maned pony frowned. His memories were telling him that he should be clearing them for later tonight and tomorrow morning for the Summer Sun Celebration, but it seemed a waste to have to fly up to each one and burst them like soap bubbles.</p><p class="double">Closing his eyes, he Reached for the power he knew he still had, his body starting to blacken and become wispy as he drew on the energy, drawing the clouds together. Pegasi seemed to have the ability to manipulate the weather here, but it wasn’t to the degree that an Heir of the Storm could, much less a Storm Lord.</p><p class="double">The clouds above unravelled, sending down a light, misty rain across the town for a few minutes as he opened his eyes again, his body returning to normal.</p><p class="double">“Well, it wasn’t ten seconds flat, but that was certainly impressive.” A female voice commented from behind him.</p><p class="double">Turning, he found himself facing a purple unicorn with an equally purple dragon standing beside her. “It wasn’t much,” He said, blushing slightly from the praise. “I just thought it would be a shame to have to fly up to pop them when I could deal with them all at once.” He shrugged his feathered wings. “I’m Dick Kirrin… though the loop memories seem to want to call me Dark Kestrel for some reason.”</p><p class="double">“Kirrin? I’ve not heard that name before, what loop do you usually do?” The purple mare asked before getting nudged by the dragon at her side. “Oops, sorry, I’m Twilight Sparkle, local anchor, and this is Spike, one of the local loopers. It seems you’re replacing Rainbow Dash, one of our loopers this time.”</p><p class="double">“Well that explains why I seem to have Pegasus Weather Management 101 in my head.” Dick responded with a slight frown. “As for my usual loop, I’m part of a group the Hub knows as the Famous Five. My older brother, Julian seems to have found a bar or something nearby and my sister, Anne is…” He trailed off, Reaching with his mind to find his sister. “With a group of birds or something.”</p><p class="double">Twilight twitched her tail. “Sounds like your brother is at Mac’s bar in Sweet Apple Acres and your sister is replacing Fluttershy.” She frowned. “That means we won’t be able to use the Elements, though I <i>think</i> Luna is awake this time so we won’t need them for a while anyway.” She motioned for him to follow her and set off towards Fluttershy’s cottage. “How much do you know about loops and how did you do that with the clouds?”</p><p class="double">Following her, Dick shrugged his shoulders. “I know the basics of them. The world tree, the problems, that there can be fused loops and such. I haven’t really looped that much that I know of. Certainly not to places like this, though we did have… I think it was Naruto ended up taking Uncle Quentin’s place once, he explained the basics. Not too long after that, we ended up in a game loop; the fused ones where there’s nobody to really do anything so you just get random quests and such.”</p><p class="double">“I know the type, I’ve been to the Dungeons and Dragons world a couple of times, the last time was going through this massive dungeon.”</p><p class="double">“We had one called Fireborn. It and… Shadowrun are functionally similar. Magic returns to normal Earth, bringing with it a lot of ‘fantasy’ creatures. The main difference is that Shadowrun is higher tech and people tend towards ‘demihumans’, Fireborn has most people end up as dragons and you get memories of being around while Atlantis was the main power in the world.” Dick shrugged again. “There are three major abilities I like from there though, Group Mind, meaning limited telepathy and empathy to certain people, in our case, each other, Heir of the Storm, which is how I manipulated the clouds. Good Storm Lords can actually create hurricanes on their own. The last one is Alternate Form, which is basically limited shape shifting to picked static forms.”</p><p class="double">“Those sound useful.” Spike commented. “And it would be interesting to end up with an entire world full of dragons.”</p><p class="double">Dick snorted in amusement. “Not everyone is happy about dragons turning up. We had more than a few near misses with the unseelie, the sluagh and the Dwellers.” He shivered. “The last group are nasty, taint driven demons. There’s also the Weeping Death, which isn’t fun, and that’s not going into the human bad guys.” He looked up as they reached a small cottage, spotting a familiar, blonde Pegasus in front of it. “Hey Anne!”</p><p class="double">Looking up from the birds, Anne flicked her tail. “Dick!” She called, hurrying over to hug him. “I’m glad to see you. What’s going on?”</p><p class="double">“You’re in Equestria, apparently replacing Fluttershy, one of our loopers.” Twilight cut in. “Twilight Sparkle, local anchor. This is my assistant, Spike, also one of our loopers.”</p><p class="double">Anne nodded slightly, taking a pro-offered hoof and shaking it. “Anne Kirrin.” She turned to her brother, “Any idea where Julian, George and Timmy are?”</p><p class="double">“Julian’s found a bar.” Dick rolled his eyes at that, though he couldn’t blame his brother considering the fact that their home loop didn’t seem to move on the same timescale for everything, leaving them at some ambiguous age between ten and twenty for seven years. “George isn’t here and neither is Timmy, I’m guessing they’re still back home.”</p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight said. “Since I know where your brother is, I’ll lead you to him and <i>hopefully</i> we can avoid setting Pinkie off with a massive party again,” She paused, looking up at the sky. “Or getting annoyed because you all showed up and she didn’t do a Welcome to Equestria party for you.” She added, leading the pair towards Sweet Apple Acres.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It had actually been a fun few days for the five of them, certainly more interesting than the normal holiday she had at the beginning of her loop since they could actually fly now. Of course with her loop memories, they had gotten the gold, again, and set up the bank account with it so that Kirrin Island would never go up for sale.</p><p class="double">One interesting thing they had learned thanks to her mother’s checking. It seemed that most of the ‘groups’ that the Hub universe had written by Enid Blyton looped as one universe about half the time, though they each had their own anchors and did loop independently. Odd, but it made some sense.</p><p class="double">Hearing a yell from above, she frowned, looking up and around until she spotted a dark dot on the horizon. Shifting her form into that of a large four-footed dragon, she focused on the spot for a moment before recognising the dark mane, bat-like wings and coat a shade or two off her own. “Jo! Down here!” She called, sending up a plume of fire before shifting back to her normal form.</p><p class="double">A few minutes later, a panting Josephine was kneeling in front of George, the three Equestrians gathered near. “What are you doing here Jo?” George asked, offering the other girl a bottle of ginger beer.</p><p class="double">“I…” Jo broke off into a coughing fit, grunting as Rayne slapped her back a few times when some of the drink went down the wrong pipe. “George, what’s going on? Where are your cousins and why are we <i>horses</i>?!” It was evident that Jo was already heading for new looper paranoia.</p><p class="double">Kneeling down, George shifted, placing a hand on Jo’s shoulder. “We’re not horses, Jo, we’re ponies. As for what’s going on, it’s a long story; the <i>short</i> version is that things went really, really wrong with reality so everything is repeating to try to get things fixed. Things like this just happen randomly so we get people replacing others, as Rayne, Lauren and Felicity are. I’d let Dad give you the full explanation, but I doubt you’d understand it.” She snorted. “<i>I</i> don’t understand it and he’s <i>my</i> dad.”</p><p class="double">“Well he is supposed to be one of the best scientists in Britain.” Jo managed, giving a weak grin.</p><p class="double">George nodded. “Come on, let’s get you settled… maybe we can try things with us being siblings this time.” She grinned at Jo’s blank look.</p><p class="double">Rayne snorted in amusement. “I take it you two know each other.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, usually we meet because Jo steals my wallow on the beach, though that’s not for… four or five years, I think. The floating timeline makes it confusing.”</p><p class="double">“That isn’t very nice of her.” Felicity commented as George hauled Jo to her feet.</p><p class="double">George snorted in amusement. “The original me isn’t that nice. I’m still pretty hot tempered sometimes; unfortunately I got it from Dad. Jo managed to get us out of a few scrapes though, starting with that one surprisingly enough. We met up again a couple of years later when she was visiting her…” She looked at Jo. “Is it your uncle and aunt that are in that circus when we meet the second time?”</p><p class="double">Jo nodded. “Something like that. I don’t even know what’s going on anymore.”</p><p class="double">“You get used to it,” Lauren commented dryly. “I haven’t known what’s going on since we got here.”</p><p class="double">“That’s because half the time you don’t even listen.” Rayne pointed out. “I swear Lightning, I am <i>so</i> glad the loop memories have us keeping you on a leash.”</p><p class="double">George snickered at Lauren’s confused look, guiding Jo towards the cottage. “Come on, Mom’s probably got something for lunch… you know, I’m kind of surprised how well I’m handling meat given I’m a pony.”</p><p class="double">“It isn’t all meat.” Felicity put in, following them. “It seems like some of the things we eat in Equestria came over when everything got rearranged. The bacon is actually hay.” That got looks from George and Jo. “It’s not that bad, besides as you are, it’s better for you than all that meat.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I guess…” George sighed. So much for that dream. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">65.11 (Barryc100588)</p><p class="double">&quot;The Night.. shall last.. FOREVER!&quot; Nightmare Moon laughed maniacally. Twilight looked at Nightmare Moon with a bored look. She could tell she was the only one Awake, and didn&#039;t feel like messing with anything this time. She wasn&#039;t even going to bother going baseline.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope. Not dealing with this this time. If Nightmare wants Eternal Night, she can have it.&quot; With that, Twilight trotted off, and Equestria was covered in an eternal veil of darkness.</p><p class="double">Life in Equestria after Nightmare Moon took over was full of fear. Ponies rarely left their homes, and crops failed to grow time after time with minimal light to sustain them. Ponies grew hungry and restless as temperatures dropped. Twilight felt regret leaving the ponies like this and resolved to try to fix her mess. She went to each of her Unawake friends, but failed to convince them to go with her into the Everfree Forest.</p><p class="double">With no option, Twilight went to the Everfree Forest alone. She knew she needed her five friends, but they wouldn&#039;t go with her. While she was gone, ponies stayed indoors, even as food stores continued to drop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon looked out at Canterlot from the balcony. &quot;I don&#039;t get it. I created Eternal Night so ponies could enjoy my night, and yet I don&#039;t see them outside playing. They remain indoors, just like it was a thousand years ago. Could I possibly be wrong? Could Eternal Night not be the way to go?&quot; Nightmare thought for a moment. &quot;Preposterous. I should just give them more time. The night will grow on them. The sun will never return.&quot;</p></p><br /><br /><br /><p><p class="double"></p><p>65.12</p><p><hr></p><p><i>Huh. Another Loop where I&#039;m Trixie.</i> Twilight stopped, pulled her wagon off to the side, and got in to see what she had to work with.</p><p class="double">“Not bad, actually,” she judged. A fair-sized library, nothing she hadn&#039;t read before but a few she didn&#039;t mind reading again; a kitchen unit, not always a certainty depending on how impoverished the wandering mage was; a collection of board games (some of them enchanted to play the opposing side) and various stage supplies.</p><p class="double">After her check, she hitched the wagon up again. Then stopped, getting a mischievous expression on her face.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Three hours later, she had the wheels enchanted with a standard cloud-walking enchantment, a small but robust cloud generator fitted to the undercarriage, and a large fan attached to the back of the wagon.</p><p class="double">As the contraption soared skywards, she poured herself a drink. “I never liked walking anyway.”</p><p class="double">With a whistle that terminated in a <i>thud,</i> something landed on her roof.</p><p class="double">Sighing, she put the drink down and poked her head out of the back, looking around and up at the roof. “Who is it... wait a sec. Trixie?”</p><p class="double">“Correct.” The blue unicorn adjusted her hat, seemingly none the worse for wear for her trip aloft. “Trixie may have irritated the Element of Honesty a little too much when she met her, when setting up the Summer Sun celebration.”</p><p class="double">“Wow.” Twilight helped Trixie down into the main area of the wagon. “How much did you annoy AJ?”</p><p class="double">“Trixie did not specify the identity of the Element of Honesty.” The sorceress looked around. “I like what you&#039;ve done with this place, by the way. The potted plant really ties the room together...”</p><p class="double">“Trixie, focus.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Trixie shrugged. “It&#039;s Awake Gilda. She galestormed me across half the country.”</p><p class="double">“Oh.” Twilight blinked. “Oh, neat. So it&#039;s one of those loops, huh? Can you two handle the Elements together?”</p><p class="double">Trixie waved a hoof. “<i>We</i> get along like a house on fire. Complete with screams. We may alienate the other Elements, though.”</p><p class="double">“Just use Pinkie as a go-between,” Twilight recommended. “Want a lift back?”</p><p class="double">“Certainly. Trixie will use the time manufacturing a parasail for a suitably epic triumphant return.”</p></p><br /><p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='70'></a><h3>Loops 66</h3>
<p>66.1 (Ghrathryn)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The three members of the Famous Five sat around a table at Mac’s bar, ignoring a group of what appeared to be ‘space captains’ sitting in a corner discussing their home loops and how each went nasty. “So we’re replacing people from this loop?” Julian asked his hooves around a tankard of Sweet Apple Acres’ Cider. “And because of that, you can’t use these Elements of Harmony?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shifted slightly. “Well, we can, but it would mean trying to find someone to take over Kindness, since we’ve already got ‘backups’ for Magic, Loyalty and Honesty. I don’t think I can find anyone in one night that could work for Kindness and trying to use multiple by yourself is straining when you’re not an alicorn.”</p><p class="double">Julian and Dick shared a look before pointing a hoof each at their sister. “Anne could possibly handle it.” Julian said, causing his sister to jump. “She’s usually the gentlest of our group, though she’s also extremely protective at times.”</p><p class="double">“Let’s <i>not</i> bring up the times we ended up Tainted.” Dick said with a grimace. He hated remembering those times. Usually it brought their worst traits to the surface at the worst possible time. “Though if this is a ‘like for like’ replacement in some areas, I can see Anne and Fluttershy getting along well and she certainly had a knack for handling the animals around her earlier.”</p><p class="double">Anne blushed at the praise from her brothers. “Well… I guess I’m just good with animals.”</p><p class="double">Dick rolled his eyes. “Anne you’ve been a Green Lord <i>dragon</i> with millennia of experience leading up to the fall of Atlantis. I’m pretty sure you had New Forest as your domain during that period and most of the creatures there were peaceful compared to elsewhere in the world.” He pointed out. Seeing Twilight’s look, he shifted slightly. “The Fireborn loop we were in, the five of us. Me, Ju, Anne, George and Tim were all humans that had dragon souls reborn I don’t know how many times. In that universe Atlantis had existed, but it died or vanished when magic was locked away from the world.</p><p class="double">“When magic came back there were areas that were… corrupted that we had to try to clear amongst other things. Each of us also started having dreams of being dragons back in the Age of Atlantis. Eventually we learned to access our abilities from then. We each had different dragon forms. I think we were all Drakes, sort of like Spike except larger and with wings.” He said, indicating the dragon, who was currently with a white unicorn he didn’t recognise.</p><p class="double">“Thing was we each had different abilities. Group Mind and Alternate Form were common but… I was a Storm Lord, meaning Heir of the Storm was my strongest ability. George was a Fire Wyrm, Ju was Cold, Anne was a Green Lord and Tim was a Stone Lord.” Dick shrugged as he explained their main abilities before jumping as a thump came from his right. Looking that way, he saw a set of books on the table by his brother.</p><p class="double">“These are everything we could find on that universe, though they’re not entirely accurate.” Julian said. “For example they list Nobility as being the key Power for the Storm Lord Legacy, it isn’t, Heir of the Storm is the Power you need.” He continued, pushing them over to Twilight who frowned, casting a spell and touching her horn to the books and papers in turn.</p><p class="double">Bringing her head back up, Twilight frowned as she rubbed her horn. “That world is… strange. It seems so like the Hub at first, but then there’s everything that happens and so many people turning into dragons.”</p><p class="double">“We know,” The siblings said together.</p><p class="double">“Still, I think we could try Anne with the Element of Kindness.” Twilight twitched her tail as she summoned the Elements from the old Castle. “I don’t <i>think</i> we will need these yet, though it will probably be a good idea to test them before we do. As I said, I think Luna is awake this time out so we probably won’t need to worry about Nightmare Moon. The next real problem will be Discord and while he’s looping he has a nasty habit of <i>not</i> letting anyone know that he is so we can never tell whether we’ve got his baseline or the looping version.”</p><p class="double">Dick frowned. “If he’s like that, then it will probably be a good idea to have a few backup plans ready, just in case he tries things.” He was, honestly, more used to normal human enemies than gods. Even in the Fireborn loop it had taken all five of them to fight off a Dweller and they had received far worse injuries than it had. If Discord was at that level they could possibly force him back if there were all five of them there to fight, but it wouldn’t be pretty.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Jo blinked at the four others in front of her, then looked at the glass in her hand and promptly slugged it back, coughing as the taste of alcohol hit her. Even with the fact she was sitting here in fur and with bat wings while George had three <i>female</i> cousins this was still too weird for her.</p><p class="double">“How does that even work?” She asked as George reclaimed the shot glass and put it on the table.</p><p class="double">George shrugged. “No idea, but reality is all pete tong…” She trailed off and grimaced. “I hate rhyming slang some days.”</p><p class="double">“What?”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, just spent far too long in London, specifically London as it probably will be in sixty or seventy years. The slang stuck rather more than I would like.” George admitted with a sigh.</p><p class="double">Shifting slightly, George looked up at Jo. “Alright, I went over this yesterday, but I guess I’d better fill you in as well. Normally my cousins, Tim and I have a number of adventures you’re not privy to, usually fifteen to nineteen, I think, though it sometimes varies high. We’re probably going to skip the first one and just have a normal holiday this time out. There’s not really much point when we don’t need to forge friendships in fire nor when we’re under threat of losing things from not having money so we’ll see what turns up. Most likely, particularly if Mom and Dad decide to take you in, come Christmas time we’ll be back on track with Roland and his ‘artist’ friends trying to steal Dad’s work.” She pointed a finger at Jo. “Most likely it’ll be because you’ve never been to school before, normally it would be me not having been to school and the boys getting sick, but since we’re likely all at the same school we can probably limit things a bit and given there’s three loopers, one of whom knows what’s going to happen here we can probably get through things so we have less of Roland than normal.”</p><p class="double">It was at that point that Fanny and Joan came into the room, the latter carrying a tray full of what looked like potato slices covered in some sort of sauce. “Speaking of schooling,” Fanny said as Joan placed the tray down. “I just finished talking to Gillian. It seems that instead of Graylands, you five will be going to Malory Towers.”</p><p class="double">George blinked. “Isn’t that the one in Cornwall that Darrel and Felicity Rivers usually go to?”</p><p class="double">Fanny nodded. “Yes it is, and yes they are aware that you don’t normally go there. It seems that this loop is a fusion of the pony world into the joint one for all of us, which has changed some things around a bit.”</p><p class="double">“Well…” George started only to trail off again. What could she say to that? It had almost always been Graylands that she and Anne had gone to, in part because they allowed pets so Timmy could join them, but at the same time she did want to find out what happened for Darrel, since the other girl was apparently the anchor for the Malory Towers group. Maybe they should get in touch with everyone they could remember from the various groups and see if they could have a meeting. What sort of adventures would the Famous Five, the Secret Seven, the girls of St Claire’s, the girls from Malory Towers, the Five Find-Outers (and Dog) and the Mannerings and Trents get into if they all met up?</p><p class="double">“Why would we be going to some place we never heard of?” Lauren asked. “Graylands was fine last term.”</p><p class="double">Fanny shared a look with George. This was probably going to be one of those things that they couldn’t really explain well. “It seemed more sensible to try to get you all into the same school and Malory Towers is the closest that has the space for five extra girls in their first and second years.” She explained. “And from what Gillian told me on the phone, Graylands has had to shut down for a year to deal with several things, including a lot of modernisation.”</p><p class="double">Lauren blinked. “I didn’t see anything about that before the term ended.”</p><p class="double">“It might be because it happened after we left.” Rayne put in, “There might have been a storm or something happen that wrecked things leading to the school so they’re having to completely redo things.” She moved to wrap an arm around Lauren. “C’mon Lauren, think of this as a chance to find new friends with our cousin and show her what we know.”</p><p class="double">“Tell you what,” George interrupted any comments Lauren or Jo might have given. “How about we get a lunch together and go to the island for a picnic. We can worry about schools getting changed when we actually need to.” She twitched her tail. “It’s always nice to see the rabbits on the island, particularly as they’re so tame.” That got Felicity bouncing in place a bit.</p><p class="double">“Oh, I wonder if they’re anything like Angel back in Equestria.”</p><p class="double">Lauren blinked. “Equestria?”</p><p class="double">“Never mind, Lauren,” Rayne sighed, getting to her feet.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lying on her back, Rayne looked up at the nearly cloudless summer sky above Kirrin Island. It was odd to think that this island could be so peaceful and yet have such a history of adventures as the ones George had told them about. Of course Lauren still didn’t quite believe everything she had been told, but that was a common problem when non-loopers were involved in loops.</p><p class="double">She frowned, hooking her arms behind her head and stretching her wings out. If George was right, they had seven years here, possibly more, meaning the loop was about as long as Equestria’s was currently and there was bound to be other things happening, particularly in a linked loop.</p><p class="double">“What would happen if these people ended up in another actually interesting school and holiday time line?” Rayne asked the air, not really expecting an answer. Most likely they would take most scenarios along that line relatively well, except for Eiken and places like that.</p><p class="double">Given the atmosphere, particularly around Kirrin, maybe it would be an idea to see if she could get Twilight to see if they could find a way to talk to the other anchors for this group of loops, set them up as another sanctuary. Certainly it would be good to have multiple universes that could actually deal with their own problems in-house and let any other looper take the time to relax.</p><p class="double">Feeling a weight on her stomach, she raised her head slowly to find a rabbit sitting, watching her with wide eyes, its ears up. “Don’t try biting me.” Rayne warned the bunny before dropping her head back to her arms. Maybe it would be worth finding out what would happen here and seeing if the various anchors would be willing to help Equestria out by giving other loopers places to unwind. If they could figure out how to deal with the ones that were in a really bad way given there was no Elements of Harmony here.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.2</p><p class="double">“Okay, how do I do this?” Spike asked, sitting cross-legged.</p><p class="double">“Well, I don&#039;t know exactly how yours is gonna work,” Dash hedged. “I mean, this is kinda a personal thing. But for me, it grew out of the idea that I had to be there for my friends. That meant that I had to know where they were, how they were and if they needed me.”</p><p class="double">“Following you so far,” Spike nodded.</p><p class="double">“And, yeah. So the Element of Loyalty is all about that – well, my one is. I want to be there for my friends, but I can&#039;t just hover over them. So...” Dash shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Can you demonstrate?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Dash crouched down, focusing, and something pulsed.</p><p class="double">“Okay, I felt that!” Spike said, excitement tingeing his voice. “Sort of a pulse of really deep magic. Like, bones-of-the-earth deep.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the Elements, alright.” Dash nodded. “Okay, now I&#039;ll scan for you.”</p><p class="double">Another pulse.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I felt that as well, but I couldn&#039;t get a direction...”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Dash sat back on her haunches. “Let&#039;s try a different tack. You know Rarity, of course.”</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>duh.</i>” Spike gave his fellow Element of Loyalty a look. “We&#039;ve only been going out since forever.”</p><p class="double">Dash grinned, and punched him in the shoulder. “It&#039;s called a conversation starter, doofus.”</p><p class="double">“I resemble that remark.”</p><p class="double">Dash shook her head, chuckling. “Anyway. Think about Rarity.”</p><p class="double">“You don&#039;t need to tell me twice.”</p><p class="double">“Right... okay, now, where is she?”</p><p class="double">Spike frowned. “Probably working on those dresses-”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t give me probably. Tell me exactly where she is, right this minute.”</p><p class="double">The dragon blinked, as her tone abruptly became more forceful. “Huh-”</p><p class="double">“Is she safe? You don&#039;t know, do you?”</p><p class="double">Spike made to stand up, and Dash pushed him back down again. “No, don&#039;t go and check. Just answer me.”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s in her kitchen,” he blurted. Then blinked. “Okay, how did I know that?”</p><p class="double">Dash grinned. “Right. I think we have our angle on your Loyalty power. Kinda like a dragon&#039;s hoard, really – you need to know if it&#039;s safe.”</p><p class="double">“Right...” Spike nodded. “That felt really strange.”</p><p class="double">“Eh, you get used to it.” Dash shrugged.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.3</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s this?” Twilight asked, pointing.</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned, with usual <i>squeak</i> noise. “It&#039;s a Party Time boat!”</p><p class="double">“What...” Twilight paused, and facehoofed. “PT boat. Right. But it&#039;s bigger than most destroyers!”</p><p class="double">“It depends on the time period, Twilight,” Pinkie said seriously. “I thought a smart pony like you would know that.”</p><p class="double">“I do, it&#039;s just... all right, what&#039;s it all in aid of?”</p><p class="double">“Well.” The earth pony put on a jaunty hat. “I sail the seven seas, bringing party to all within range!”</p><p class="double">“We only have about three seas on our – wait, range?” Twilight zeroed in on the most concerning word.</p><p class="double">“I have fourteen UACs – Unmanned Aerial Cakes – along with a VLP system with ninety-six cells, and four QF 15-pounders.” Pinkie pointed. “The VLP system is a Vertical Launch Party mechanism, which is able to engage forty-eight flopped parties in less than fifteen seconds with time-for-party fire at a range of up to twenty miles, and the guns are Quick Flan dispensers.”</p><p class="double">Twilight gave the ship another look-over. “And by the looks of it, it can go up rivers, too... okay, what did you call it?”</p><p class="double">“PTAS Laughable!”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight decided not to ask what PTAS stood for. Knowing Pinkie, it would be &#039;Pinkie&#039;s Totally Awesome Ship&#039;. “So, what do you need my help for?”</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged. “I only just realized I built it in a lake. Can you teleport it to the ocean, please?”</p><p class="double">“...can&#039;t you do it yourself?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, but I&#039;ve just built a ship. I&#039;m on strike.” Pinkie waved a union flag.</p><p class="double">“Oh, fine then.” Twilight built the spell, then triggered it.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Gustav le Grande sighed. “There is no ozzair choice. Ah must leave zis place of ponies and return to mah homeland.”</p><p class="double">Something flew in the window and exploded in a puff of sugar and spice.</p><p class="double">When the smoke cleared, he discovered he was wearing a pointed party hat. And there was a cake on the table.</p><p class="double">The icing spelled out <i>Who&#039;s Awesome? You&#039;re Awesome!</i> Complete with translation into four different languages, none of which was his own native tongue, and a note apologizing for forgetting that one.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Is that a Partydar?” Twilight asked, pointing. “How did you...?”</p><p class="double">“Well, it&#039;s really just a clock!”</p><p class="double">The &#039;radar&#039; screen beeped, and flashed something about taking some cookies out of the oven.</p><p class="double">Pinkie hopped over to the bridge oven, explaining further as she went. “I use the Element of Laughter to tell when someone&#039;s having a mope, and party away!”</p><p class="double">“...your use of sophisticated military technology to deliver amusement is both scary and heartwarming.”</p><p class="double">“Thanks! Hey, try a Cluster Cookie, they&#039;re dispersal-tastic!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.4</p><p class="double">As the sky in the east turned pink with the promise of dawn, the ponies of Ponyville waited for their ruler to appear.</p><p class="double">“..and here she is,” the Mayor announced. “Please welcome, Princess Celestia!”</p><p class="double">Applause started, then stopped in moments when a scruffy gryphon slouched on stage.</p><p class="double">“Er...” the Mayor said, nonplussed. “Where&#039;s Princess Celestia?”</p><p class="double">“She got called away. Family emergency or something.” The gryphon blew a bubble with some gum, then popped it with a claw. Starting to chew the gum again, she shrugged. “I&#039;m the backup act.”</p><p class="double">“How can you be a backup act?” Rich asked uncertainly. “I mean... just... how? Princess Celestia is an alicorn who raises the sun and rules the country! You&#039;re a gryphon we&#039;ve never seen before!”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;d vote for her,” Dash announced into the silence. “That&#039;s my old flying school friend Gilda.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, hi Dash!” Gilda perked up slightly. “Fancy meeting you here.”</p><p class="double">The Mayor coughed. “Miss... Gilda, is it? You still haven&#039;t satisfactorily explained why-”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah.” Gilda spun her tail around. “Ta-da.”</p><p class="double">Light streamed in through the windows.</p><p class="double">“Right, when do I get paid... I swear, getting me out of bed at three in the morning...” Still muttering, her words occasionally interacted by the <i>smak</i> of her gum, Gilda sloped off stage to the near-silent sound of bafflement.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There we go, Gilda dear,” Rarity pronounced. “I&#039;m not sure why you wanted this, but I think I did reasonably well with the time available.”</p><p class="double">“Nah, &#039;s cool.” Gilda inspected the caparison. As instructed, it permitted her wings full range of movement, while still hanging down with enough surface area to permit a pattern to be displayed.</p><p class="double">Since the pattern Gilda had requested was the phrase <i>CAUTION: BORED GRYPHON</i>, it amounted to the pony version of a t-shirt with a slogan.</p><p class="double">“I figure, I give a warning, then maybe I&#039;ll get bothered less...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.5</p><p class="double">A pegasus with brown, shaggy fur and unkempt wings went charging down the main street of Ponyville, drawing stares from the crowd.</p><p class="double">This then turned into astonishment as Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Applejack and Rarity followed her at a run. Rainbow Dash circled overhead, and Fluttershy brought up the rear at a walking pace.</p><p class="double">The reason why she had chosen this strategy became clearer a moment later, as the brown pegasus went past her in the other direction, followed by most of the Elements.</p><p class="double">“What&#039;s going on?” Rose asked Fluttershy, her voice quavering.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Fluttershy said, then slowed to a halt. “My friends got very excited about something and started running around after that pegasus mare there. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s important...”</p><p class="double">The whole procession went past a third time. This time, the brown mare was chasing the rest of them.</p><p class="double">“Is it... dangerous?”</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t <i>think</i> so,” Fluttershy answered with careful honesty. “But I&#039;d stay out of the middle of the road, myself.”</p><p class="double">The two earth pony Elements rushed out of the alleyway between two houses, followed by the brown pegasus, and with Twilight and Rarity behind <i>her.</i></p><p class="double">Dash blundered out of the top floor of Rarity&#039;s shop with a bedsheet wrapped around her, and tripped over the end, crashing by the most astounding coincidence directly into her friends&#039; quarry.</p><p class="double">“Got&#039;cha!” Applejack shouted. “Nice work, RD!”</p><p class="double">“Thanks, Spike,” Rainbow Dash said woozily. “Why is it all white?”</p><p class="double">Leaving the frowning Rose, Fluttershy ambled over to her friends. “We caught her?”</p><p class="double">“Yep!” Twilight confirmed.</p><p class="double">“Yay.”</p><p class="double">“Now, let&#039;s see who you really are,” Twilight added, casting a spell at the brown pegasus. There was a flash of light, and she turned into... a black pegasus.</p><p class="double">“Gasp!” Pinkie enunciated clearly. “It&#039;s Old Mare Crankshaft from the water mill!”</p><p class="double">“I had to get you away from my house at night, in case you discovered my secret!” Old Mare Crankshaft said bitterly. “I&#039;m a were-pegasus.”</p><p class="double">Several ponies blinked.</p><p class="double">“But... you <i>are</i> a pegasus,” Rarity pointed out sensibly.</p><p class="double">“Yeah.” Old Mare Crankshaft shrugged. “And I&#039;d have gotten away with it if it weren&#039;t for you meddling Elements. And your dog!”</p><p class="double">The friends looked around.</p><p class="double">“Winona?” Applejack tried, then shook her head. “We ain&#039;t got a dog here.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie barked. “I volunteer to be the dog!”</p><p class="double">“Well, mystery solved,” Twilight pronounced, in the face of evidence. “Good job, gang.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chrysalis giggled. “The looks on their faces...”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s performance art, really,” Twilight agreed. “Nice work, by the way. Same time next week?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” Chrysalis thought for a moment, still giggling. “Maybe this time I could be a crooked land developer who wants to turn the library into a chimney...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.6</p><p class="double">“I am Smaug the Red!” The huge dragon leaned down close to Spike&#039;s nose. “I am without equal! My armour is as battle steel, my teeth are swords without peer, my claws like manifold diamonds, my wings bear terror aloft with the force of a tornado, the shock of my tail cuts all defence, and my breath the ruin of nations! I have burned Napoleon&#039;s Europe and slain five hundred dragons in the doing. I alone spread fire and destruction across Deraine, Sagene and Roche, with neither the puling Anchor Kailas nor his pet Storm able to stop me. Neverwinter was but windblown ash by the time I left it. I have incinerated Corellia in a day and a night, defeated the mightiest battleship of the Imperium of Man, and destroyed the Volturi and all their kin!”</p><p class="double">&quot;And yet,&quot; Smaug&#039;s enormous head snaked still closer to Spike, sniffing him once before drawing back in disgust, &quot;here you are. A whelp, a <i>hatchling</i>, nursed with the milk of lesser beings and their ideals! Who are you, to <i>dare</i> to call yourself a dragon? Who are you, to think you have the right to challenge me for my hoard? To deny me the right to be what all dragons <i>should</i> be?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike looked back up, taking a single quick breath, and then exhaled deeply and evenly. “I am Spykoranuvellitar, known as Spike. I do not challenge for your hoard, because I have no need for it.”</p><p class="double">“Blatant lies,” Smaug declared, rumbling. “All dragons need a hoard.”</p><p class="double">“Storm, that you mention, has no hoard beyond the love of his rider.” The larger dragon snorted his contempt, but Spike continued. “Toothless, who you may have met, is a partner with his rider. Temeraire, who you <i>must</i> have met, sees his hoard of gold and gems as important – but mainly for where it comes from, and specifically for <i>who</i> it comes from.”</p><p class="double">Smaug frowned. “Pretty words, youngling. But why do <i>you</i> not need my hoard?”</p><p class="double">“I have a better.” Spike straightened his shoulders. “For me, no gold nor gems compares with my friends. They, and their love, are my hoard in truth.”</p><p class="double">“Truly foolish.” Smaug blew a jet of fire into the cavern, which licked around a stalactite and made it glow cherry-red. “Love of lesser beings... no gold... how can you even claim to be a dragon?”</p><p class="double">“Dragons aren&#039;t mindless beasts,” Spike said, and didn&#039;t react when Smaug roared laughter. “We&#039;re intelligent, just like humans or ponies or dwarves. We can choose to follow our instincts or not.”</p><p class="double">“But why <i>should</i> we not?” Smaug pressed. “Dragons are the greatest creatures in existence! I do what I will, and none can gainsay me!”</p><p class="double">“Then you&#039;re not a good person.” Spike shrugged. “Being a dragon doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re immune to morality. It means you&#039;re powerful – that&#039;s all.”</p><p class="double">Smaug&#039;s teeth clashed together no more than a foot from Spike&#039;s muzzle. “<i>I</i> am powerful!” he roared, shaking the cavern. “<i>You </i>are a mere wyrmling who consoles himself with the affection of nothings, who has no hoard worthy of the name, who comes before me alone and presumes to lecture <i>me</i> on what a dragon is!”</p><p class="double">“I do presume.” Spike nodded. “I presume because, for all your might and majesty, you&#039;re really kind of sad.”</p><p class="double">Smaug blinked, actually unable to believe someone would dismiss him that thoroughly.</p><p class="double">Spike pushed on into the pause. “Your wealth is measured in gold, in gems, in treasure and in vanquished foes. But I can ask my friends for help, no matter the time or the place, and get an answer. I have a wife, who I love and who loves me. I have <i>others</i>, and that&#039;s one thing you don&#039;t have. You&#039;re alone, atop your hoard, in a splendid isolation... and yet, more than anything else you want someone to share it with. To tell them how wonderful you are, because it always rings hollow when you tell yourself.”</p><p class="double">With a tiny flash of blue light, a ring appeared on Spike&#039;s finger. It was made of a bluish metal, surmounted by a diamond, with a tiny fragment of shining red within it. “This is my most valuable possession. Not because of what it is, but what it signifies.”</p><p class="double">“That is the thing you have which holds most value?” Smaug repeated, softly. “Then I desire it.”</p><p class="double">Spike looked up, frowning. “Why? I mean, it&#039;s my wedding ring... That&#039;s why it matters to me.”</p><p class="double">“Because you have it, and I do not.” Smaug spread his wings. “I demand it, because it is the right of the strong to take what they wish from the weak. If you do not wish to cede it, then show me what <i>real</i> strength your <i>wife</i> may grant you!”</p><p class="double">Smaug inhaled massively, causing the gems in his hoard to clink and rattle with the wind he produced. His neck reared back, and he breathed out a massive gout of red flame directly upwards – shot through with orange, and yellow, and cones of bright blue.</p><p class="double">The entire mountain exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight jumped as the sound of a mighty explosion reached her, and rushed to the window.</p><p class="double">All over Ponyville, heads were poking out of windows and ponies out on their afternoon shopping runs turned towards the Everfree Forest.</p><p class="double">Twilight followed their gaze, and gaped. <i>That pyrocumulus cloud must be half a mile high!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Why is there a volcanic eruption going on in the Everfree?</i></p><p class="double">A colossal red shape exploded out of the cloud, extending vast wings, and performed a sharp hairpin turn before launching a lance of white-hot fire directly downwards.</p><p class="double">Twilight blanched. Spike had gone off in that direction for &#039;a chat&#039; with the dragon of the Everfree... but that certainly was <i>not</i> the dragon of the Everfree. What was going on?</p><p class="double">A holodisc clattered to the table behind her.</p><p class="double">Snatching it up with her magic without taking her eyes from the wyrm, Twilight triggered it.</p><p class="double">The sound of an explosion came through, followed by a cough. “Spike here, Twilight. Everything&#039;s under control-”</p><p class="double">A loud <i>slam</i> came next. Looking at the hologram, Twilight saw that Spike had just barely avoided a rock the size of a house from landing on him.</p><p class="double">“Well, sorta... that&#039;s Smaug. Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll handle him – just make sure we don&#039;t wreck everything nearby in the process.”</p><p class="double">The message ended.</p><p class="double">Twilight felt frantically for her element-sense... still two Loyalty elements active. Since one was the (unawake) Dash, that meant the other had to be Spike.</p><p class="double">Still, what the <i>buck</i> was going on?</p><p class="double">She began composing her own messages. One each to Shining Armor, Celestia, and Luna, asking for their help in keeping the devastation localized.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With a hissing roar, the lance of plasmated air focused in from ten feet across to a single inch, and Spike&#039;s blue lightsaber drank it up without much more than a flicker.</p><p class="double">Spike mentally shuffled through his Pocket contents, trying to find what it was he&#039;d need. One set of Rarity-quality robes – as flammable as a granite tor, thanks to the fact they were made out of woven diamond and sapphire – and the shield that Shining had made him once. It might not be a particularly &#039;jedi&#039; thing to have, but it was at least large enough to hide behind in a pinch.</p><p class="double">“Do I see a knight in shining armour?” Smaug laughed, then continued in a tone of heavy sarcasm. “Truly a true dragon, to wield weapons to fight rather than rely on tooth and claw and flame!”</p><p class="double">Spike squinted upwards, trying to see through the smoke, and reached for the Force. It was there in a moment, a strong cable of blue and white light, and he drew on it gladly.</p><p class="double">The shield snapped up almost of its own accord, driven by a flash of precognitive insight, and a blast of wider, less focused fire splashed off it like rain.</p><p class="double">“An impressive trick, hatchling!” Smaug said, chuckling. “But inadequate.”</p><p class="double">The Force warned Spike of danger, and he leapt clear-</p><p class="double">Smaug unleashed the full force of his fire.</p><p class="double">The ground where Spike had been standing simply melted. Everything within ten yards of the impact area became a puddle of lava, and the force of the blast cracked the rock around it in a crazy pattern of broken and crumbling pieces.</p><p class="double">Spike landed badly, blown off his impact point by the sheer impact of the concussion, and sprawled before rolling upright.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Twilight!” Shining called, galloping into the library. “What&#039;s going on?”</p><p class="double">“Spike&#039;s in a fight in the Everfree,” Twilight summarized. “I need-”</p><p class="double">The Royal Sisters materialized in the kitchen. After a sneeze as Luna&#039;s wings hit Celestia&#039;s nose, they were sufficiently untangled to move into the main room.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Twilight started again. “I need you three to help me throw up a shield around the Everfree. Spike can handle himself, I&#039;m fairly sure, and the best way we can help him is to make sure he doesn&#039;t have to worry about us.”</p><p class="double">“What caused this?” Celestia asked, already channelling magic to supply Twilight with.</p><p class="double">“Spike went off to... I think he said to try and recruit the Dragon of the Everfree for some support group, or something. But-” Twilight winced as the ground shook. “It turned out to be Smaug from Arda, instead. And he&#039;s Looping.”</p><p class="double">Luna&#039;s expression hardened. “Right. We shall aid gallant Spike in defeating this-”</p><p class="double">“No,” Twilight shook her head, building the shield spell. Her brother pitched in, layering his own spellforms on top of hers. “Spike said he could handle it. I&#039;m willing to let him have a try.”</p><p class="double">Celestia looked at her for a moment, then nodded. “Indeed. He isn&#039;t a child any more.”</p><p class="double">“He hasn&#039;t been one for a long time,” Twilight agreed. “Right, that should hold. I&#039;m going to start evacuating the wildlife.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Right, I&#039;m fighting Smaug. The Dragon Dread. The Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities.</i></p><p class="double">Spike raised his shield, blocking a blow from Smaug&#039;s tail. The knife-bladed appendage glanced off and scored a long furrow in the bedrock, and Smaug laughed.</p><p class="double"><i>Smaug the Impenetrable</i>.<i> Well, there&#039;s one that didn&#039;t turn out to be true...</i></p><p class="double">He jumped again, drawing on the Force, and shot across from one side of the cleared area to the other. Slipping his shield back into his pocket, he drew a yew longbow and nocked an arrow.</p><p class="double">A moment&#039;s concentration, and he let it fly.</p><p class="double">The arrow flew straight and true, striking Smaug&#039;s scales right over his heart, and glanced off. Smaug grinned, baring his teeth, and hovered above the smaller dragon tauntingly. “You think me a fool, to fall for the same trick more than once?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s worth a try.” Spike shrugged. “Besides, I like archery.”</p><p class="double">He drew back a second arrow and released it.</p><p class="double">Smaug spat flame at it, and it erupted in a blast of unbound magic. “I am not blind, hatchling!”</p><p class="double">Between one word and the next, Smaug released his Dragonfear.</p><p class="double">Spike felt a wave of atavistic terror stab through him. Intellectually, he knew what it was – clearly Smaug had picked up a few supernatural tricks from his time in Faerun – but Dragonfear didn&#039;t answer to rationality.</p><p class="double">“Look at you, cowering before me,” Smaug said softly, landing before the shivering purple dragon. “Defeated, as all are before me. Smaug Unconquerable, Smaug the Magnificent.”</p><p class="double"><i>There is no emotion; there is peace.</i></p><p class="double"><i>There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.</i></p><p class="double"><i>There is no passion; there is serenity.</i></p><p class="double"><i>There is no chaos; there is harmony.</i></p><p class="double">Spike stood, looking Smaug in the eye.</p><p class="double"><i>There is no death; there is the force.</i></p><p class="double">“It&#039;ll take more than that.”</p><p class="double">With a gesture, he replaced his lightsaber in his subspace pocket. “Believe it or not, I don&#039;t actually want to kill you.”</p><p class="double">“You? Kill me?” Smaug shook his head, a dangerous orange light building behind his teeth. “I think it is not <i>I</i> who must fear that.”</p><p class="double">Smaug fired another blast of full-power dragonflame directly at Spike. This time, he didn&#039;t dodge.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight shielded her eyes against the flash of blue-white light.</p><p class="double">“Is he okay?” Shining asked.</p><p class="double">The younger sibling just smiled.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Smaug blinked. “I must admit, that has never failed to work before.”</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged, as the molten rock around him began to cool to obsidian. “I&#039;m a dragon, remember.”</p><p class="double">He jumped, and kept going as wings snapped out from beneath his robe. Smaug spread his huge wings, and slapped the air to follow.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>Thank you, Fluttershy and Dash!</i> Spike thought with the small corner of his mind not focused on keeping ahead of Smaug. The larger dragon was a powerful flyer, but Spike had both technique and agility on his side. The former thanks to his fellow Element of Loyalty, the latter because Fluttershy had finally worked out with him how he could shift wings out of proportion to his size. More area meant more manoeuvrability.</p><p class="double">Fire blazed through the air around him, and spawned savage upcurrents which clawed at his airflow. With a thought, he spun Smaug&#039;s latest dragonbreath into a single compressed ball of energy, and absorbed it to heal a few minor wounds.</p><p class="double"><i>Twitchy tail</i>, the Force whispered, and he dove out of the way of Smaug&#039;s claw as it tried to smash him from the sky.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That&#039;s kind of impressive...” Twilight said, quietly, as Spike did an aileron roll (without ailerons) and spun away from Smaug&#039;s dragonfire. The plasma burst hit her shield, which rippled but coped with it quite nicely. “I wonder why he&#039;s Looping...”</p><p class="double">“Well, assuming the admins were responsible at all, they&#039;re not exactly infallible.” Shining nodded to her, and she winced, remembering a few examples of less than perfect planning. “And he&#039;s kind of a major player in the book.”</p><p class="double">Twilight shaded her eyes from another flare. “True. But if we&#039;ve got the job of clearing up again...”</p><p class="double"><i> - </i></p><p class="double"><i>Right.</i> Spike executed a Kulbit, shedding speed so dramatically that Smaug overshot him entirely, and slowed to a hover. <i>No more tactical retreats.</i></p><p class="double">“I thank you, hatchling, for giving me such an exhilarating chase,” Smaug said in a conversational tone. “Nevertheless, I also thank you for simplifying my task. Now, hold still so I do not destroy that ring of yours when I destroy you.”</p><p class="double">Spike inhaled, and blew a thin jet of green flame as Smaug unleashed his own roaring inferno.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Whoa!” Shining said, dancing backwards a step as a cone of flame erupted from the apex of the shield dome. “Did it just fail?”</p><p class="double">“Nope.” Twilight&#039;s voice was smug. “I think he listened when we discussed tactical use of teleportation. He&#039;s flame-sending Smaug&#039;s own fire.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The flame-jet died down, and Spike grinned impudently. “No luck there.”</p><p class="double">Smaug stared fixedly at him for a second, and then his tail lashed forward like that of a striking scorpion.</p><p class="double">Spike moved smoothly aside, with all the time in the world, and took hold of the tail just behind the flat spade. With careful precision, he pulled just before Smaug reached maximum extension and caused the wyrm to sprawl forwards in the air.</p><p class="double">Courteously, he waited until Smaug had recovered his equilibrium.</p><p class="double">Another fireblast came his way. This time, Spike held out a palm, and enclosed the fire in a blue globe of Force energy. Bringing it to his muzzle, he ostentatiously blew it out.</p><p class="double">Smaug growled, smoke seething from the corners of his mouth, then lunged forward with shocking suddenness and bit down on Spike-</p><p class="double">Tried to bite down.</p><p class="double">Spike bared his own teeth in a fixed grin as he held two of Smaug&#039;s fangs, one in each paw, while pushing down with his feet to keep the mouth open.</p><p class="double"><i>Strength of the earth, sugar. Ain&#039;t nothing like real earthbendin&#039;, but you hold your stance and it ain&#039;t trivial to move you.</i></p><p class="double">For fully ten seconds, he held Smaug&#039;s jaws open, then gathered himself and <i>pushed</i>.</p><p class="double">Smaug resisted for a moment, then let his mouth hang open and began coughing. Spike dropped free, performed a wingover and hovered once more in front of Smaug&#039;s nose.</p><p class="double">He shrugged. “Well?”</p><p class="double">Smaug looked at him with half-lidded eyes full of hate. Then smiled. “So, your friends give you strength, do they?”</p><p class="double">The huge red dragon... vanished.</p><p class="double">Spike blinked, then gaped, turning towards Ponyville – where Smaug had reappeared, <i>outside</i> the shield, and was already inhaling.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oh, cress!” Shining blurted, realizing the magnitude of the disaster. “Twi! Quick, move the-”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s horn was already glowing, building a new set of shields over Ponyville. It would be a race to see who was ready first.</p><p class="double">Then her first shield shattered like glass.</p><p class="double">Spykoranuvellitar of Equestria, already a hundred feet long and swelling every second, hit Smaug the Red like a horizontal meteorite. The abruptly <i>smaller</i> Ardan dragon was body-checked clear across the town and floodplain, and impacted on a nearby mountain with Spike&#039;s paws still on his side.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Let me make one thing very clear,” Spike rumbled, his tone deceptively soft. “You <i>don&#039;t</i> hurt my friends.”</p><p class="double">Smaug made a funny wheezing sound, a little like a punctured accordion. This was probably because Spike was sitting on his torso.</p><p class="double">“I meant everything I said before,” Spike added. “I <i>do </i>think you&#039;re lonely, I <i>do </i>consider my friends to be the thing I most prize, and I <i>didn&#039;t</i> want to kill you. I still don&#039;t,” he said, contemplatively. “But you&#039;re certainly making it <i>tempting.</i>”</p><p class="double">“I... surrender,” Smaug gasped out. “My life and my hoard are yours. Do what you will.”</p><p class="double">Spike looked down at his erstwile opponent. “I make you a gift of your life. Do not squander it.”</p><p class="double">“Why?” Smaug asked. “Why would you just...”</p><p class="double">The purple dragon shifted, taking his weight off Smaug. Then he sighed. “Hay, I dunno. Maybe it&#039;s because you&#039;re kind of what I could have become.”</p><p class="double">Smaug looked blank.</p><p class="double">“Way back in the baseline, I had this... breakdown, I guess, where I went mad with greed. Grew to a huge size – like this, but not controlled properly – and started to rampage. I didn&#039;t hurt anyone, not seriously, but that&#039;s more luck than anything... and Rarity pulled me out of it, in the end.”</p><p class="double">“Rarity...” Smaug repeated. “Is she the wife you spoke of?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, though she wasn&#039;t then. It took hundreds of years for us to start going out – we took it slowly, for good reason.” Spike smiled briefly, then let it fall off his face. “Anyway, I kind of see you as what I might have been like without her to save me. Consumed by the desire for more wealth, more concerned with what you could get than what you already have...”</p><p class="double">Air hissed through Smaug&#039;s nostrils.</p><p class="double">“And desperately alone, as well. I read the book – you were the last of the dragons on Arda, weren&#039;t you?”</p><p class="double">The red dragon nodded reluctantly. “I was indeed, after the death of Ancalagon the Black.”</p><p class="double">“And I bet you spent a lot of time with him next loop, didn&#039;t you?” Spike asked, earning an even more reluctant confirmation. “Besides, it&#039;s kind of a rule around here. No-one gets written off.”</p><p class="double">After a long moment of silence, Spike rolled fully upright. “Right. On the understanding that you don&#039;t try to kill anyone for the rest of the loop, I&#039;m willing to return your hoard to your control. Further, if you will pledge to refrain from killing where not necessary, I will teach you how to carry objects <i>between</i> loops.”</p><p class="double">Smaug&#039;s eyes snapped up. “How to...?”</p><p class="double">Spike nodded, concealing a smile. <i>Gotcha.</i> “I also request – <i>not</i> require – that you talk to a friend of mine, by the name of Fluttershy. She is a shapeshifter – a Druid, in Faerun parlance – and understands the workings of instincts. I think it would be helpful for you.”</p><p class="double">Another long pause. Then Smaug slammed a claw into the rubble. “Alright! I agree, curse you!”</p><p class="double">Spike beamed. “Nice doing business with you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I see...” Fluttershy said, scribbling some notes down on her pad of paper. “Yes, I&#039;ve seen that before in created metabiological <i>bauplans</i>. It&#039;s a classic case of imperfect construction of instinctual-sapience balance, which means your intellect is unable to properly balance the conflicting requirements of your baser wants and needs.”</p><p class="double">Smaug growled, two jets of smoke curling up from his nostrils.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t take that tone with me!” Fluttershy admonished. “Or you won&#039;t get a lollipop after we&#039;re done. Now, as I was saying, this doesn&#039;t mean that you&#039;re inferior in any way. After all, it&#039;s hardly your fault, and this kind of problem is resolvable with a course of treatment.”</p><p class="double">The pegasus finished writing, and ripped a sheet of paper off the pad. “Right, that&#039;s my diagnosis for the physical side. Now, tell me about your mother.”</p><p class="double">“My mother? My mother was the very living rock of Arda itself, and when I and the other dragons were spun from the earth we left it base and dulled!”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded. “I see. And how does that make you feel?”</p><p class="double">“Superior,” Smaug stated bluntly.</p><p class="double">“Right, let&#039;s start there...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.7</p><p class="double">“The main question before us,” Commander Hurricane said pompously, “is to determine the structure of the military. For it is well known that the military is what truly forms the foundation of a state-”</p><p class="double">“Tosh and drivel,” Princess Platinum interrupted him. “After all, nobility is the only true continuity of a realm. Mares and stallions come and go, but the Duke of Black Rock will always be ruler of the Duchy of Black Rock.”</p><p class="double">“Everything&#039;s built on the land!” Puddinghead said, brightly. “If it wasn&#039;t, it&#039;d just fall down!”</p><p class="double">The other two leaders chuckled, but their aides took a closer look at Puddinghead. That had sounded altogether too obvious, but once you looked a bit deeper...</p><p class="double">“Yes, well,” Hurricane added kindly, shaking his head. “As I was saying, you can have military nobility, of course. It&#039;s a good way to ensure competent stallions in competent roles-”</p><p class="double">Lieutenant Pansee coughed. “Sir, if you recall, the last hereditary commander of the Pegasi was relieved from duty after he flew upside down into a mountain while drunk.”</p><p class="double">Hurricane looked back for a moment. “Well, it&#039;s easy enough to lose your way in a snowstorm-”</p><p class="double">“It was a glorious cloudless day, sir.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, well.” Hurricane sighed. “Alright, you&#039;ve made your point.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“FINE!” Platinum shouted, cutting off the four hundred and twenty third repetition of a demand from Puddinghead for a proper electoral system. “You can have your damned parliament!”</p><p class="double">Puddinghead stopped talking, grinned, and started cheering.</p><p class="double">“But only if you shut up!”</p><p class="double">Puddinghead stopped cheering. Then she caught the eye of Smart Cookie, and winked ostentatiously. Neither of the other two rulers noticed.</p><p class="double">“But who&#039;s going to get <i>into</i> parliament?” Hurricane asked. “I don&#039;t trust elections.”</p><p class="double">A bell rang.</p><p class="double">The six founders stopped talking, and looked towards the front of the room. “How was that?”</p><p class="double">“Excellent, thank you,” Cheerilee said, as they all dropped their alternate forms and returned to being changelings. “It looks like it&#039;ll have to be a double period, but that&#039;s really getting the spirit of those discussions down.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis spoke up from the back of the empty classroom. “It <i>really</i> helps when we can actually ask Pansy, Clover and Cookie about it. And yeah, acting&#039;s fun.”</p><p class="double">“You didn&#039;t actually do any of it, my queen,” one changeling muttered.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll pretend I didn&#039;t hear that,” Chrysalis replied loudly. “Especially as I&#039;m playing Celestia in the second part.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.8</p><p class="double">“Okay, this time, tanks,” Applebloom pronounced. “They&#039;re easier to fab, so we should be able to have the match next week. Oh – and, remember, baseline World War Two tanks only!”</p><p class="double">The other CMC members nodded. “Gotcha!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara climbed into her SU-100 SP gun. Not quite a tank, technically, but close enough – and it fitted her preferences. (Besides, they hadn&#039;t let her have six T-34.)</p><p class="double">Then the ground started to shake.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That is cheating!” Tiara shouted from the forward half of her tank. The back half had been completely crushed under-tread by something the size of a large whale.</p><p class="double">“What?” Applebloom asked, from her P-1000 <i>Ratte.</i> “It&#039;s totally a WW2 vehicle.” </p><p class="double">“Which they never even bothered making because it&#039;s...” Tiara counted on her hooves for a moment. “One, stupid, two, impossible, and three, it couldn&#039;t move over the ground! Look, you&#039;re <i>sinking</i>, for acorn&#039;s sake!”</p><p class="double">“Ah.” Applebloom disappeared back into the hull. Something went clunk. “Ah, great, there goes the fourth engine today...”</p><p class="double">There was a grinding roar, and the <i>Ratte</i> began to move. Just.</p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t it go any faster?” Tiara asked, giggling.</p><p class="double">“Not with that many engines broken.” Applebloom shrugged. “Couldnt&#039;a ambushed you if ah hadn&#039;t had a hill to go down.”</p><p class="double">Something flew overhead.</p><p class="double">“Now that, there,” Applebloom added, pointing as the aircraft did a careful turn in the distance. “That there <i>is</i> cheating. Hey, Scoots! Yer cheatin&#039;!”</p><p class="double">“No I&#039;m not,” Scootaloo protested over the radio. As she got closer, it became clear that it was indeed a tank.</p><p class="double">Sort of. It did have enormous wings strapped to the side, and a buzzing propellor providing power.</p><p class="double">“See,” Scootaloo continued as she got closer again, “I heard of this thing called the M1932. So, yeah. Besides, it&#039;s not as silly as what Sweetie&#039;s got.”</p><p class="double">“I dread to think...” Diamond Tiara said absently.</p><p class="double">Something surfaced in the waters of a nearby lake.</p><p class="double">Applebloom sputtered. “That&#039;s just a submarine with tracks!”</p><p class="double">The submarine in question trained its deck gun on them, and then fired a torpedo into the water.</p><p class="double">“Whoops...” Sweetie said. “Wrong button.”</p><p class="double">Tiara and Applebloom dove back into their armour, as the (really very small) deck gun started plinking away at the side of the Ratte. Said Ratte had moved a full six feet since starting up.</p><p class="double">“This is a farce, is what it is,” Diamond Tiara opined. “Wait a sec. Where&#039;s Silver?”</p><p class="double">WHAM.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Silverback chuckled, and wrapped her prehensile tail around the sighting equipment.</p><p class="double">Nobody had said she <i>couldn&#039;t</i> use a really big artillery piece...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.9</p><p class="double">“Well,” Twilight said, eventually. “That was a thing.”</p><p class="double">She joined the others in staring at her drink. Then, as though on a signal, the five mares drank.</p><p class="double">“Sure was,” Applejack concurred, as her brother came around and refilled their drinks. “Any idea where... <i>she</i> is?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s in Sugarcube corner,” Dash replied promptly. “Which is a good thing.”</p><p class="double">They stared at the drinks. They drank the drinks.</p><p class="double">“If I ever meet E.Nesbit, I think I might give her a good slap,” Rarity mused.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy winced. “Her. And, well, it&#039;s not really her fault,” she said, as Mac topped up their drinks.</p><p class="double">“Okay, where th&#039; hell were you?” he asked, sitting down next to them with a glass of water. “Ain&#039;t seen you like this in a good while, sis.”</p><p class="double">“Ever read a book called Five Children and It?” Twilight inquired. When Mac shook his head, Twilight continued. “It is a sand-fairy that can grant wishes – well, in the book, at least. And we were the Five Children.”</p><p class="double">Mac blanched.</p><p class="double">“Yep,” Applejack confirmed. “Pinkie was It.”</p><p class="double">“It was how she treated it as a game of wish tag,” Dash muttered, then took another long swig. “Especially &#039;cause she was always It by definition.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.10 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Right, so...&quot; Takua brought his hands together. &quot;Most of you who are... replacing?&quot; He shot a questioning glance to Spikama and received a confirming nod. &quot;Replacing the turaga already know some of this. But... well, there was a great and terrible war, and a world was shattered into fragments. The Great Beings built Mata Nui to help fix the world - and spend a hundred thousand years exploring the galaxy to observe other societies and figure out how to keep the thing from happening again. But the smaller beings that the Great Beings built to maintain Mata Nui... they gained sapience somewhere along the way and one of them - Makuta Teridax - decided he wanted to take over. So just as Mata Nui was getting back, Teridax knocked him out and set a few things in motion, which also resulted in us Matoran ending up here and amnesiac.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whoa.&quot; Leinbow&#039;dash rubbed the back of her head. &quot;No pressure, huh?&quot;</p><p class="double">Poplejack crossed her arms. &quot;So, what exactly is the plan here?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well.... Mata Nui is, technically, dying. So we&#039;ve got to get a willing volunteer to go a few kios south to a dangerous island, find their way through chambers that will test their worthiness, claim the mask of life, head straight down through the pit - filled with sea monsters and former warlords - and into Karda Nui proper, and...&quot; The matoran took a hiss of breath. &quot;...willingly put on the mask so it sucks out their life force to stabilize Mata Nui.&quot;</p><p class="double">The gathered toa, turaga, and matoran stared at him.</p><p class="double">&quot;....what,&quot; Scowkii finally managed.</p><p class="double">&quot;It can&#039;t be any of these toa,&quot; Takua added, pointing at the six tall warriors, &quot;because they&#039;re needed elsewhere. And it can&#039;t be me because the last time I did it I ended up in some place where I was completely organic and had these... creatures constantly wanting me to...&quot; He shuddered. &quot;Why can&#039;t organic creatures be built like normal?&quot;</p><p class="double">Talight winced in sympathy. &quot;Yeah... I can see how that would be traumatizing, especially for you. Especially as your first fused loop. Future reference, you&#039;re the Anchor, don&#039;t get yourself killed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right.&quot; Takua nodded. &quot;Um... usually it&#039;s Matoro who... dies. But it could be anyone.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Does it need to be one of us?&quot; Tialer asked quickly. &quot;Or can it just be a big source of life energy?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... don&#039;t know, actually.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Apple Bloom, you&#039;re going to build us a boat and when we get to Karda Nui, you, me, and Silver will be growing the biggest tree possible.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Got it.&quot;</p><p class="double">The local anchor blinked in surprise. &quot;You three have the power of the green?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s an aspect of our native loop,&quot; Spoohli explained.</p><p class="double">&quot;...Right. Um. Be prepared to transform into Toa on the way. That tends to happen. Also you should take Bloomparu, Scowkii, and Nyngu with you too. And if you run into Velika, tell him not to activate Marendar.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;Anyway. So, you six toa will find a list of things to do to prepare to wake Mata Nui up. After... whatever life force thing happens, you need to find stones to unlock a chamber in Karda Nui and convince the Mask of Life to insert itself into a generator. It&#039;s alive but.... very immature. Oh, also, avoid the Makuta and try to evacuate Karda Nui as quickly as you can.&quot;</p><p class="double">The toa of air crossed her arms. &quot;And where will you be during all this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll head downstairs and get the mask of light. Oh, I should have mentioned this earlier, sorry. I&#039;m going to become the toa of light and ask you six to help me imprison Teridax; you have point all your elemental powers at him at once. Then you&#039;ll need to get the matoran back down to Metru Nui quickly while I try to hold his mind inside his body, because he... can telepathically project himself, and if he does that while Mata Nui is waking up he can take over Mata Nui&#039;s body - &quot;</p><p class="double">Spikama sighed. &quot;I&#039;ve had telepathic training. We should have the turaga help keep him mentally imprisoned.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Anyway, after Mata Nui wakes up, he&#039;ll fix the shattered world and then we can all get out. But we&#039;ll have to deal with the natives...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">66.11 (Drachefly)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Captain Zelnick ran his fingers over the command chair&#039;s arm-rest as he debated what argument he&#039;d try this time. The Zoq-Fot-Pik were remarkably hard to minimize the losses of. In twenty loops, he&#039;d only once managed to get them to completely cancel their near-suicidal scouting missions deep into the heart of the Ur-Quan Doctrinal War, and he wasn&#039;t entirely sure how he&#039;d done it then. It was easier to get the Utwig to stay put, and they had a mechanical oracle telling them to go.</p><p class="double">With a deep breath, he opened the channel. &quot;Hellllllwhat.&quot;</p><p class="double">With a smile, the white unicorn at the left gave her violet mane a toss and said, &quot;I take it you&#039;re looping.&quot;</p><p class="double">The pink pony at the right gave a broad smile and screamed, &quot;Woo! Humans! I knew we&#039;d get humans sooner or later! Ni-ice ship! For this universe, anyway.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick blinked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sir?&quot;, lieutenant Fenson asked. &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot; The rest of the bridge crew was even more nervous, but keeping quiet - up until now, the captain had been preternaturally confident and effective in dealing with aliens.</p><p class="double">The question helped reset Zelnick. He got up out of his seat and closed in on the main viewscreen as if it would actually help him see them more clearly. &quot;Uh. Right. I&#039;m Captain Zelnick of the New Alliance of Free Stars. We, uh... I&#039;m sorry, who ARE you?&quot;</p><p class="double">The one at the right blurted, &quot;Pikkie Pie, but you can call me Pinkie!&quot;</p><p class="double">At the left, &quot;I am Rarity, a...&quot; she paused, amused &quot;&#039;Zoq&#039;. Which is a fancy way of saying &#039;unicorn&#039;, it seems.&quot;</p><p class="double">The middle one said, &quot;I&#039;m Fottershy...&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick staggered. &quot;You TALK?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;... I&#039;m sorry? I messed that up, didn&#039;t I? I&#039;ll be quiet now.&quot;</p><p class="double">The other two swarmed in on her, Rarity making soothing sounds. &quot;Oh, Fluttershy, he doesn&#039;t mean you shouldn&#039;t. He was just... impressed!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie turned and came in close to the camera. &quot;You&#039;re making Fluttershy cry. And do you know what we do with people who make Fluttershy cry?&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick sat down hard in the seat. &quot;Allow them to apologize and start over?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie thought for a moment. &quot;Hmm. I was thinking &#039;antimatter confetti&#039;, but yours is better.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick sighed in relief, and stared at the quivering pegasus. &quot;I&#039;m sorry? I just...&quot; he trailed off. No good explanation for this came to mind.</p><p class="double">Pinkie interrupted, &quot;You had this vivid dream where you were in a time loop and everything was always the same and you knew ahead of time what would happen and you could learn what worked and didn&#039;t work, and you were getting really good at it, and then we showed up instead of the Zoq-Fot-Pik and it was like Hello-what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick was about to concur when Pinkie amended, &quot;Actually, it was more of a Hellllllwhat?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ahem. Yes, that pretty much sums it up.&quot; He held up a finger to put off the bridge crew&#039;s urgent questions, and turned back to the aliens. &quot;So... who are you and where are you from?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity replied, &quot;Why don&#039;t you come down, or we come up, and we&#039;ll have a nice long chat about that?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;As soon as I&#039;ve explained to my crew, yes.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;... so I should start the Thraddash/Ilwrath war as soon as possible, and the Yehat civil war as late as possible?&quot; Rarity took down notes. &quot;Are you sure those are necessary?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you can do without the Yehat, but in the long run, it would save lives to start it. I suspect the best timing is to let it run for only three or four weeks. Nothing big happens by then, usually. And for the others... maybe you can manage to convince the Ilwrath to pick on the Kohr-Ah, but I usually can&#039;t. I actually lost twice, trying. And then we all die.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... see. Well, I&#039;ll get this distributed. If anyone I know ends up looping into your role, this will be very handy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Zelnick sighed. &quot;This exchange would be a lot more useful for <i>me</i> if I had a pocket like you do.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy allowed, &quot;That would be... nice.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Zelnick opened the channel, more hopeful about meeting Talana than ever before. Some day, she could actually remember him.</p><p class="double">His hopes came crashing down. The woman on the screen was definitely Talana, all right. But... &quot;Fllrgl!&quot;</p><p class="double">Taluna shifted her wings. &quot;I&#039;m impressed. That&#039;s even less coherent than the average first utterance by a human captain on making contact with Syreen.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<br /><p>67.1 (Midnight Crescent)</p><p class="double"><u><hr></u></p><p class="double"><u>Twilight the underdog, part 2</u></p><p class="double">Twilight leant her head against the train’s window, the slow rattle of the carriage lulling her to sleep. However, not long after she finally drifted off, the train jolted to a stop, bringing her nap to an unexpected end.</p><p class="double">A voice drifted in over the tannoy “This train has now arrived in Domino City. Please ensure you have all belongings with you if departing here.”</p><p class="double">“C’mon, this is us.” Tristan said, throwing his jacket over his shoulder “Thanks for letting me tag along, by the way.”</p><p class="double">“No problem. I needed a guide anyway.” Twilight replied, with a small smile. She stood from her seat, and followed Tristan on to the platform</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Serenity Nyx Wheeler lay in her bed, trying to get her blurry vision to focus. After failing for what felt like the hundredth time since she Awoke, she turned over and buried her head in a pillow.</p><p class="double"><i>Alright, I can’t use my magic and I’m practically blind. Chlorophyll, this world sucks.</i> She thought to herself, when there was a knock at the door. Before she could even give an answer, a nurse had walked into the room.</p><p class="double">“Hello Serenity, how are you feeling today?” She asked cheerfully.</p><p class="double">“Fine, thank you.” Nyx flipped over once again, and flashed the nurse her best fake smile.</p><p class="double">“That’s good. Now, are you ready for your tests?” The nurse asked, still smiling. Nyx sighed. Her loop memories had shown her what she could expect, and she was not looking forward to it. She nodded, and the nurse wheeled over the equipment. “Let’s get started then.”</p><p class="double">Almost an hour later, Nyx flopped back on her bed, exhausted and bored out of her skull. The testing equipment loomed in the corner once more, as the nurse made her exit.</p><p class="double">“Thank you, Serenity. I’ll check in on you later.” The nurse said, the gentle words seeming more like a threat.</p><p class="double">Alone again, Nyx just lay there, wishing for her magic, her eyes to get better, or just for something, <i>anything</i> to happen.</p><p class="double">But most of all, she wished her momma was there.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight’s fingers tapped on the armrest beside her as she waited for the cab to make any more headway through the city streets.</p><p class="double">“I forgot how bad traffic can be... How much longer do you think we’ll be?” Twilight asked Tristan, after another ten minutes without any progress.</p><p class="double">“Well, it is rush hour in the city centre, it’s always bad.” Tristan shrugged his shoulders “Actually, come to think of it, this isn’t that bad, all things considered.”</p><p class="double">Twilight’s eyes widened at the prospect that it could actually get worse than it already was.</p><p class="double">“How far from the Hospital are we?” She asked, fumbling around in her pockets.</p><p class="double">“Not much more than a mile now.” He said, watching her actions curiously. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“Alright.” She turned to address the driver. “That’s close enough.” She handed over a bundle of notes. “Keep the change.”</p><p class="double">Twilight climbed out the door, and weaved through the traffic to the sidewalk.</p><p class="double">Tristan followed a few seconds later, “Hey, slow down. I get you’re desperate to get there, but rushing off without me isn’t actually going to help...”</p><p class="double">“I know, I just don’t want to leave her alone like this any longer. Now, which way.”</p><p class="double">“This way.” Tristan said, turning down the intersection, before waiting for Twilight to follow him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight waited at the Hospital reception, her arms crossed. Tristan looked around the room anxiously, before dragging her over to an empty group of chairs.</p><p class="double">“Alright, something’s bothering you. What’s wrong?”</p><p class="double">“He never visited her, Tristan. The nurse wants to see me, to talk about ‘Serenity’s condition.’ She wouldn’t have needed to do that if Joey had ever been here before.”</p><p class="double">Tristan took a deep breath. “OK, you’re right. Joey doesn’t visit Serenity that often. You know why?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head.</p><p class="double">“Their parents have split custody. Serenity lives with their mother, and Joey with their father. ”</p><p class="double">“Well, I saw the loop memories. I know that...”</p><p class="double">“And how much else did you get from them?”</p><p class="double">“I... I guess I kinda skipped over that part.” Twilight looked sheepish.</p><p class="double">“Their father is an alcoholic and a gambler, and their mother is a nurse at this hospital. Now, you’ve taken Joey’s place this time. So, who ended up with who?”</p><p class="double">Twilight stayed silent.</p><p class="double">“Starting to see why Joey didn’t visit her?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, a little.”</p><p class="double">A small cough came from behind Twilight. The pair turned to look at the source, one of the Hospital nurses.</p><p class="double">“Miss Wheeler, I’m your sister’s nurse. I’ve been told to update you on your sister’s condition. Now, we have managed to diagnose your sister’s illness. I’m afraid it’s not good news...”</p><p class="double">Tristan turned away at that point. Twilight nodded.</p><p class="double">“We’ve diagnosed her with Retinitis Pigmentosa, which means that th...</p><p class="double">“The photoreceptor cells in her eyes have deteriorated. And now her Retinal Pigment Epithelium is becoming mottled.”</p><p class="double">The nurse and Tristan both stood with their jaws agape. Twilight looked around at the pair, before hurriedly trying to back out of her comment.</p><p class="double">“Uhh... I started reading up on what it could be when she got admitted?”</p><p class="double">The nurse took a few seconds before she could reply. “Just... Just go see your sister. I... I need to take a break...” The nurse walked off down one of the hallways, muttering to herself.</p><p class="double">Once they were alone again, Twilight turned to Tristan. “I guess I need to be a little more careful about that stuff, huh?”</p><p class="double">“What, talking about rare medical diseases to a level as high as the experts? No, I don’t see how that could cause <i>any</i> problems.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, yeah, I get it. Jeez.” Twilight said as they knocked on Serenity’s door. Seeing the puzzled look Tristan was giving her, Twilight paused in the doorway. “What?”</p><p class="double">“... No, it’s nothing. Ignore me.” Tristan said after a few seconds.</p><p class="double">“O...K...” Twilight said, walking into the room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nyx woke from her nap as someone knocked on her door. There were voices outside her door, and then two people walked in.</p><p class="double">Before she could even ask who was there, she felt two arms embrace her. “It’s me, Nyx. I’m here.”</p><p class="double">Nyx felt tears begin to fall down her face as she returned Twilight’s hug. When she did speak, it was barely a whisper. “I missed you Momma.”</p><p class="double">“I missed you too, Nyxie.” Twilight broke away from Nyx, and sat down next to the bed. “So, how long have you been Awake?”</p><p class="double">“Just a few days. And so far, this loop is awful. I can’t use any magic. The only person who’ve been to see me are nurses. And they only want to run tests. Are you here to get me out?”</p><p class="double">“I’m really sorry about that, Nyx, but you need to stay here for a while yet. I promise, I’m doing what I can, but I need you to wait here until then.”</p><p class="double">“But it’s boring here.”</p><p class="double">“Nyx...”</p><p class="double">“Do you mind if I talk to her?” Tristan said from the back of the room.</p><p class="double">“Umm, Ok.” Twilight said, slightly puzzled.</p><p class="double">“Nyx, I’m Tristan. I’m a friend of the people you and Twilight are replacing. I know you’re eyes are bad, and the tests are annoying...”</p><p class="double">Nyx nodded her agreement.</p><p class="double">“...But they know what’s wrong with you now. And, if you stay here a little longer, they’ll know how to fix it. But there’s a catch.”</p><p class="double">“What?” Nyx asked.</p><p class="double">“It’s going to cost a lot of money. Money I’m guessing you don’t have...”</p><p class="double">Nyx shook her head. “I don’t loop often enough to get an allowance...” She folded her arms, and huffed.</p><p class="double">Tristan raised an eyebrow, and looked and Twilight, who just mouthed “Don’t ask.”</p><p class="double">“Well, don’t worry about that, because Twilight is going to win you the money in a Duel Monsters tournament.”</p><p class="double">“She is?”</p><p class="double">It was Twilight’s turn to stare at Tristan. He motioned with his arms towards the beaming Nyx.</p><p class="double">“Of course I am.” Twilight said, although her voice didn&#039;t suggest she had the greatest of confidence.</p><p class="double">“And, as an added bonus, I can even stay with you, and let you know how well she’s doing. Would you like that?”</p><p class="double">“Sure!” Nyx said, looking overjoyed at the idea of having anyone other than the nurses around.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, what’s the plan Yugi?” Tea asked as the pair sat down for lunch.</p><p class="double">“Well, we need to lure Kaiba to the Game Store. I think if I just duel you instead of Joey, then that can be done as usual. You still have your old deck, right?”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, bu...”</p><p class="double">“OK, so that’s part one. This time, I want to try and just duel him for the Blue Eyes, see if we can stop it getting torn up.”</p><p class="double">“That’s fine Yugi, b...”</p><p class="double">“After that, Pegasus will probably either duel me or invite me to the tournament. I can just accept the invitation, or add a stipulation of my own. Either way, I should be able to get Twilight and myself accepted.”</p><p class="double">“Yugi, as good as that sounds, I was actually asking if you think we should wait until they get back to kick things off...”</p><p class="double">“Oh...” Yugi blushed, before thinking for a few seconds. “Actually, I think we should do this without her if we can. Letting her see an early baseline Kaiba isn’t really fair on him.”</p><p class="double">Tea nodded in agreement. “Alright. Hey look! Here he comes!”</p><p class="double">“Alright, let’s get set up quick.” Yugi pulled out his deck, and placed it on the table. “And draw!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight, Nyx and Tristan talked for a while, before a nurse poked her head in the door. “Visiting times are ending in five minutes.”</p><p class="double">Twilight hugged Nyx one more time. “You be nice to the nurses, Serenity.” Twilight stressed the name, making sure Nyx understood.</p><p class="double">“Good luck, Josie.”</p><p class="double">“I’ll see you for the first day of Duellist Kingdom, Serenity.” Tristan said, catching himself before he started waving to the blind girl.</p><p class="double">“OK!”</p><p class="double">Tristan and Twilight walked out of the room. When they were a decent distance from the room, Twilight turned to Tristan, a look of frustration on her face.</p><p class="double">“What was that in there?”</p><p class="double">“Huh? I don’t know what you’re talking about...”</p><p class="double">“There is no cure for her condition. Why would you lie about that?”</p><p class="double"></p><p>Tristan shook his head. “I wasn’t lying. Trust me, you’ll get a phone call or something in a day or two about it. It’s practically one of the constants in the loop. Her condition varies, but they always find a cure. Just as the price of the cost varies, the DK prize money moves to match it too.”</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. “Alright, I&#039;ll believe you. But why offer to stay behind?”</p><p class="double">“Ahh... I’ve been planning to do that for a few loops now. This just happens to be the perfect loop to do it. Remember, I’ve seen this movie, and in Duellist Kingdom, I get to give Joey a card that would never fit in your deck, and throw something into a forest that will just warp back to the person who had it during the next tournament anyway. You won’t lose anything by me staying behind, and I can keep Nyx company at the same time too.”</p><p class="double">Twilight thought over that for a few seconds. “You know, you really remind me of someone...”</p><p class="double">“Is that a good or bad thing.”</p><p class="double">“Not tellin’ ya.” Twilight said, before looking at the strange glance Tristan was giving her. “OK, that’s twice you’ve been giving me those funny looks. What is it?”</p><p class="double">“It’s just, that’s twice you’ve started talking like Joey.” Twilight stared at Tristan, who sighed. “Look, it’s been twice in a week. I’m willing to call it a coincidence for now, and it’s probably nothing important anyway. If it starts to happen more often, we can just ask Yugi and Yami about it. They might know something more about this sort of thing.”</p><p class="double">“Alright, now let’s get back.”</p><p class="double">“Sure. And if we’re fast enough, we might even get to watch Yami and Kaiba’s duel.”</p><p class="double">“Right!”</p><p class="double">The pair climbed into a cab, and set off towards Domino Station.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Yugi made a big pretence of showing Tea around the card section of his grandpa’s store.</p><p class="double">“What are we doing, Yugi?” Tea whispered when Solomon became distracted by an actual customer.</p><p class="double">“We’re stalling for time. Kaiba won’t be here for another minute or two, and Grandpa won’t keep the Blue Eyes out very long.”</p><p class="double">The store emptied almost as soon as Yugi finished talking. Yugi looked around, and nodded to Tea. She took out two cards from her actual deck, and walked over to Solomon.</p><p class="double">“Mr. Muto. Could you let me look at your really rare card one more time?”</p><p class="double">“Now Tea, why would you ever need to see it again?”</p><p class="double">“I found some new cards, and I want to see how good they really are. If they’re anywhere close to yours, then they’ll be great.”</p><p class="double">“I don’t know...”</p><p class="double">Tea sighed inwardly, before flashing Solomon the biggest puppy dog eyes she could.</p><p class="double">“...But how could I say no to you?”</p><p class="double">Just as Solomon unlocked the cabinet, and withdrew his Blue Eyes, the store’s bell rung. Turning around, Yugi saw it was indeed Seto Kaiba.</p><p class="double"><i>Just in time...</i> Yugi thought, turning back to his Grandpa, who was now halfway through his all too familiar spiel.</p><p class="double">“...Has one, I obviously have this one, and the world’s number one duellist has done amazingly well to have collected the other three.”</p><p class="double">Yugi frowned. Something seemed off, and it took him a moment to figure it out.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait, that makes five. Yami, there&#039;s only ever been four before, right?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Yes, that is a new change.</i> Atem responded. <i>I wonder who has the fifth...</i></p><p class="double">A quick glance confirmed that Tea had noticed the change too, but before they could question Solomon about that revelation, Kaiba had burst between the pair. His attempts to buy Solomon’s card went about as well as usual.</p><p class="double"><i>Alright, it’s now or never</i>. Yugi told Yami in their shared mind. <i>You’re up.</i></p><p class="double">“I have a proposition.” Yami said, his signature smirk on his face. “Perhaps we could duel for the card?”</p><p class="double">Kaiba laughed before answering. “You? Duel <i>me</i>!? I don’t know who’s more senile – you or the old man. I’m the world’s number one duellist. What makes you think you’d last more than three turns?”</p><p class="double">“Nothing. But, if you’re so confident you’d win, then shouldn’t this be an easy decision for you to make?”</p><p class="double">Solomon grabbed Yami by one of his shoulders and wheeled him round to face him. “Yugi, you can’t go betting with cards that don’t belong to you! Especially not when they’re my cards!”</p><p class="double">“Grandpa, don&#039;t you trust me?”</p><p class="double">Solomon sighed, and shook his head.</p><p class="double">“It’s not about trust, Yugi...”</p><p class="double">“As touching as this sounds...” Kaiba interrupted “If I was actually interested in seeing this, I’d have stayed home and watched cable. If you’re serious about duelling for the card, then come to the Kaiba Corp Building by 6:30 tonight. If not, well, I <i>will</i> get what I want.”</p><p class="double">Kaiba left the store, and an uneasy silence descended.</p><p class="double">After a minute or two, Solomon spoke up. “Yugi...”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Grandpa?” Yami responded.</p><p class="double">“You’ve bet my prized possession on a duel you have very little chance of winning, and you did it without my permission. I hope you can understand why I’m disappointed in you.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, Grandpa.”</p><p class="double"><i>So much for that plan... </i>Yugi told Yami.</p><p class="double"><i>It was a sound plan, Yugi. We just need to execute it differently.</i></p><p class="double">Yugi switched back just as his Grandpa asked a question.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, could you repeat that, Grandpa?”</p><p class="double">“I asked if you thought that boy believed in the heart of the cards.”</p><p class="double">“I wouldn’t think so...”</p><p class="double">“Hmmm...” Solomon stood in contemplation for a few seconds, before handing Yugi his Blue Eyes. “Here. Make that boy respect the Heart of the cards.”</p><p class="double">Yugi was stunned for a few seconds, before he finally responded. “You got it, Grandpa!”</p><p class="double">I <i>think the only reason he did that is because Kaiba called him senile..</i>. Yami quipped.</p><p class="double"><i>You’re probably right...</i> Yugi responded, still staring at the card. <i>But that’s not important right now. We have a duel to ‘prepare’ for.</i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tristan looked down at his watch as he and Twilight raced into the Kaiba Corp Building. It told him that it was 7:00.</p><p class="double">“Did we make it in time?” Twilight asked, breathing deeply after the run from the train station.</p><p class="double">“Well, they usually start around seven.” Tristan replied, before noticing the tall man walking towards them. “I think we’re about to find out.”</p><p class="double">“Mr. Taylor, Miss Wheeler?” The man asked as he approached.</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that’s us.”</p><p class="double">“My name is Roland. Mr. Muto mentioned that you may be delayed. I’ve been instructed by Mr. Kaiba to escort you to the duelling arena upon your arrival. Their duel should have</p><p>just begun. Please, follow me.”</p><p class="double">“Well, at least we won’t miss the end, I guess.” Tristan said, as the three of them entered an elevator. Roland pressed a couple of buttons, and the doors slid shut.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Yami watched as his swords of revealing light wore off, leaving Kaiba’s three Blue Eyes free to attack once more. Looking at the Life Point readout, Kaiba smiled.</p><p class="double">While he was still on 1100 Life Points, Yami’s had slipped to a measly 50. Granted, he’d taken more damage than he’d expected, but he was still one attack from defeating Yami, and claiming his fourth Blue Eyes.</p><p class="double">“This duel is over, Yugi. None of your pathetic monsters could hope to stand up to the onslaught of one Blue Eyes White Dragon, let alone three.” Kaiba said.</p><p class="double">The door to the arena opened, and Kaiba’s smile widened as Twilight, Tristan and Roland walked in.</p><p class="double">“Perfect! Now your friends will get to witness your defeat as well.” Kaiba turned to face Yami, and finally noticed something wasn’t right. Despite the situation, Yugi was laughing. “Did I say something funny, or did you just finally snap?”</p><p class="double">“Kaiba, you asked about my ‘Pathetic Monsters’, and I just couldn’t help myself. My deck has no pathetic monsters. But it does contain a dragon slayer.”</p><p class="double">Kaiba’s smile turned into a look of confusion. “A dragon slayer?”</p><p class="double">Yami’s smirk returned, as he summoned his final monster. “Go, Buster Blader!”</p><p class="double">Kaiba’s face went pale as the hologram appeared on the field. “Buster Blader!? That&#039;s not possible! How did you get that card?&quot;</p><p class="double">Yami stared across at Kaiba. &quot;I live at my Grandpa&#039;s game store, Kaiba. He&#039;s a former Regional Champion. A man who had one of the Blue Eyes White Dragons. Did you honestly think I wouldn&#039;t have planned for your ace? Now, you seem to know a lot about my card. Tell me, with your three Blue Eyes on the field, how much stronger will he become?&quot;</p><p class="double">He did the math in his head, and he dropped his cards at the result. &quot;4100 attack points... No, it can&#039;t be...“</p><p class="double">“Yes Kaiba, it can. Strong enough to slay your dragon, and wipe out your life points. You were right Kaiba, this duel is over. Buster Blader, attack.”</p><p class="double">Kaiba collapsed to his knees as his lifepoints plummeted to 0. “How? How could I lose to an amateur?”</p><p class="double"><i>Should we give him the same speech as always, Yugi?</i></p><p class="double"><i>Nah. Let’s just leave him be, and see what happens.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Alright, Yugi. I just hope you know what you’re doing.</i></p><p class="double">Atem and Yugi switched places, and Yugi climbed down from the arena.</p><p class="double">“Well done, Yugi.” Tea said, as Tristan and Twilight walked over from the other side of the arena.</p><p class="double">“Knew you could do it.” Tristan said, before lowering his voice so only the group could hear. “Seriously, do you ever actually lose that duel?”</p><p class="double">“Only when I’m trying.” Yugi replied just as quietly.</p><p class="double">“So...” Twilight said, watching as a few Kaiba Corp employees carried Kaiba away from the other end of the arena. “What do you guys usually do now?”</p><p class="double">“Well, wait around for Pegasus to get in touch, mostly.”</p><p class="double">“I meant more about how you pass the time until then...”</p><p class="double">Yugi just stared at her for a few seconds, before he held up his deck in response.</p><p class="double">Twilight’s mouth hung open briefly. “I shouldn’t have even asked, should I?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.2 (Ranma-sensei)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, tell me...&quot; Twilight began, massaging her forehead, &quot;How this is even possible.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know.&quot; Diamond Tiara gave an awkward shrug. &quot;I did everything I could, but somehow...&quot; She gestured with her chin toward the bookshelves, which were covered in apple juice.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re sorry, Twalight.&quot; Applebloom shrank back.</p><p class="double">&quot;We- We just wanted ta be... recognized.&quot; Scootaloo scuffed her front left hoof on the floor.</p><p class="double">Tiara almost popped a vein. &quot;And so you decided to parade your friendship to <i>Princess Twilight AROUND </i><i><b>FOR ALL TO SEE</b></i>!!?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We said we&#039;re sorry.&quot; Sweetie Belle&#039;s ears dropped low in shame.</p><p class="double">Twilight decided to step in before Diamond could explode: &quot;Listen, girls; I know you didn&#039;t mean any harm, but wasn&#039;t it good enough to just be friends with DT? No, don&#039;t answer that. Tell you what.&quot; She waved her hoof across the library, &quot;Fix up this mess and we&#039;ll never talk of it again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yay, thank you, Twilight!&quot;</p><p class="double">Watching the Cutie Mark Crusaders scamper off, Diamond Tiara gave a long-suffering sigh. &quot;And they say unawake <i>me</i> is a hoofful.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight just nodded in agreement. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.3 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that didn&#039;t work.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke with a pounding headache. As her vision cleared, blearily, she took in the remnants of a chalk line that was drawn around her, and saw Spike staring at her, looking a little worried. She blinked as the memories of what she had been trying to accomplish swept over her, and immediately cast a suite of inverted detection spells. There was some temporal scarring around her, but it appeared to have dissipated, likely due to the psychosomatic temporal shift that occurred upon Awakening. The Loops didn&#039;t play nicely with most other time manipulation spells.</p><p class="double">Bringing her focus back to Spike, she caught the tail end of what he was saying. &quot;...for the second time?&quot; She quickly parsed back through what he had said to her that she had been half-listening to.</p><p class="double">&quot;No, it doesn&#039;t seem to have had much of aaaoh my gosh, I know where I am.&quot; Twilight finally matched up the variant formula with her knowledge of fiction from the Hub. This was from that time loop story about Equestria that she had studied, back when she was trying to determine if there was a method for breaking free of the Loops. (She decided not to think about it – it would only give her a headache.) Which meant...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight appeared in the middle of Celestia&#039;s bedroom, having slid between the anti-teleportation barriers, and landed on a small table that was set up with a tea service. She stumbled, knocking over the teapot, before catching herself, extending her wings slightly. She had Ascended to get the power necessary for slipping through the spellwork. Celestia and Chrysalis, both very obviously Awake, looked up from the tea cups that they had been chatting over. Twilight took in the scene, before chuckling nervously.</p><p class="double">&quot;I guess I&#039;m not needed to tip the scales?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia smiled. &quot;No, it is quite alright. Chryssie has called off the swarm and we were just discussing how we could try and integrate them in this Loop when you decided to join us. Would you like a cup?&quot; Celestia levitated a cup of tea in front of Twilight, having righted the teapot and fixed the china Twilght had smashed in her impromptu entrance.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, yes, thank you.&quot; Twilight carefully took the cup and stepped lightly down off the table. She turned to glance at Chrysalis, who had her mouth open and was experimentally running her tongue over sharpened teeth.</p><p class="double">&quot;I have venom sacs this Loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled, before pausing. &quot;I have to check on the Elements!&quot; And with a flash, she vanished. Celestia caught the cup before it could hit the floor.</p><p class="double">&quot;Always in a hurry. Now, Chryssie, my memories tell me that the area where Las Pegasus usually sits is vacant, so we can probably establish your primary settlement there. What jobs do you think...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.4 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stared, wide-eyed, at the scene before her. She should have known something was up when the Changeling Federation had replaced the Griffon Empire in what was otherwise a baseline Loop, but she hadn&#039;t put two and two together.</p><p class="double">It was Shining and Cadence&#039;s wedding, and it had appeared to be going smoothly. Chrysalis had shown up, Unawake, but as a guest, and she had brought several of the changelings. She had profusely thanked Cadence and Celestia for the invitation, saying that weddings were true feasts for Changelings. The wedding had progressed up until the point when they were to take their vows, then everything had gone sideways.</p><p class="double">A massive Griffon has burst into the hall, shouting his objections to the marriage. Twilight had been ready to jump in when Cadence ran forward, shouting &quot;Rikard!&quot; After that, the whole story came out. Apparently, when Cadence was young in this Loop, she had befriended Rikard. She had only viewed him as friends, but he had felt something more. Eventually, they parted, but, when word reached him at the Wandering Flock (this Loops home of the Griffons) that Cadence was getting married, he had rushed here.</p><p class="double">Now, he and Shining were fighting an honor duel over Cadence&#039;s hand. Rikard roared as he leapt at Shining, only for Shining to spin and prove that Earth Ponies didn&#039;t have a monopoly on bucking. A sphere of magic came as a follow-up, but Rikard slid underneath, swiping at Shining&#039;s legs. Shining leapt back and threw up a barrier, which Rikard immediately began pounding away on.</p><p class="double">Slowly, Twilight made her way around the room to where Cadence was crouching, trembling. Twilight reached out to comfort Cadence, when suddenly Cadence turned her head, revealing a wide grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Isn&#039;t it so romantic?&quot; She squealed lightly, with a gleam in her eye that Twilight wasn&#039;t used to seeing there, not when she wasn&#039;t Awake and on a Love Spree, anyway. Slowly, Twilight just nodded and backed away, as Cadence turned back just in time to see Shining sidestep a charge and send Rikard charging into the wedding cake. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So, are the venom sacs a common thing?&quot; Trixie asked. &quot;Or is it just loop random?&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis shrugged. &quot;It comes and goes. Usually it&#039;s a sedative, sometimes it&#039;s nuerotoxic, and what the hay are you drinking?&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn blushed. &quot;Ah... you know how some aspects of, um, biology vary from loop to loop?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We were just discussing that, yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Weeeeeeell, Twilight made this brew for loops like this one where... aheh... let&#039;s just say if I didn&#039;t drink this, next week would be very energetic for the both of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...meh, it&#039;s your decision.&quot; The changeling shrugged. &quot;I don&#039;t care either way. Why&#039;s it black, though?&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie&#039;s face scrunched up. &quot;I don&#039;t know. And it tastes horrible too... well, bottoms up.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.6 (elmagnifico)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When Applebloom had first found out he was looping, she&#039;d talked about abilities, and how loopers tended to wind up in the craziest situations. He&#039;d told her about how he didn&#039;t need fancy unicorn princess powers.</p><p class="double"><i>Macintosh watched the scene, like he had umpteen times before. Twilight was either playing her role or not Awake. It was his turn.</i></p><p class="double">Most loopers hadn&#039;t seen his abilities. Largely because the grand majority of them were invisible. Ways of watching, listening and perceiving, which he&#039;d picked up from detectives, leaders and psychologists. All to the point of helping others.</p><p class="double">“<i>The night will last forever!”</i></p><p class="double">He&#039;d acquired some combat training in the guard, and when he was clandestinely gathering skills, before he knew Eternal Twilight was not something he&#039;d have to take down some day. Nothing earth-shattering. Until that one loop.</p><p class="double">“<i>Eenope.”</i></p><p class="double">Not that one loop with Twilight. A different one. He looped into a scientist, whose baseline started as a mild-mannered individual, and wound up an emotion-bound behemoth.</p><p class="double">“<i>Insolence!”</i></p><p class="double">The bomb, however, was just what made the change so dramatic. The emotion, drawn into physical strength, was where the power came from.</p><p class="double"><i>He could hear the retaliatory strike charging.</i></p><p class="double">Such a channel was exactly what he brought back from that loop.</p><p class="double"><i>Those watching him, and knew what to look for, would notice his eyes had gone a different shade of green.</i></p><p class="double">Eternal night would mean no crops.</p><p class="double"><i>Breathe in, breathe out.</i></p><p class="double">Crops were important, but it was the ponies that they fed that made them important.</p><p class="double"><i>The bolt of solid darkness crashed into his face.</i></p><p class="double">Without food they&#039;d die.</p><p class="double"><i>He could feel it pulling, trying to rend him limb from limb for his impudence.</i></p><p class="double">If he didn&#039;t stop her, they&#039;d die.</p><p class="double"><i>So he pulled right back, holding himself together, quite literally.</i></p><p class="double">He wasn&#039;t angry per say, just determined.</p><p class="double"><i>The astonishment of those around him was practically palpable.</i></p><p class="double">Eternal night must not happen.</p><p class="double"><i>He took a step, approaching the nightmare.</i></p><p class="double">Eternal night would not happen.</p><p class="double"><i>A second bolt struck, and he grunted. Another step.</i></p><p class="double">The others he had time for.</p><p class="double"><i>Another step, another hit. Closer.</i></p><p class="double">He could do things his way.</p><p class="double"><i>He could feel his individual components crying out for release, to fly apart. He told them to hold firm. Closer.</i></p><p class="double">With Nightmare Moon though, he had but twenty-four hours from loop start to work with.</p><p class="double"><i>Close enough.</i></p><p class="double">So a more direct method was required.</p><p class="double"><i>As he neared her, he reached back with his right front hoof, and brought it around like a steam hammer.</i></p><p class="double">Mac smash. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.7 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Girls... I didn&#039;t expect you to bring company.&quot; Oh, yes she did. This was Twilight&#039;s fourth baseline time through these events, and she had them pretty well down pat now.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ohhh! You live in a house full of books?&quot; Diamond Tiara gushed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, it&#039;s a lib-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What a bold design choice!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You should SO do that, Di!&quot; Silver Spoon nodded.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know, right?&quot; Diamond Tiara grinned back at her yes-pony.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... come in,&quot; Twilight said, leading the fillies into the common room.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wow, so a princess lives here!&quot; Diamond Tiara gasped.</p><p class="double">Twilight ground her teeth. UnAwake Diamond Tiara was a pill, and she was quite tired of swallowing this particular prescription.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, since we have guests,&quot; she said brightly, &quot;I think it&#039;s only fair that I begin with them. You girls can practice a bit while I focus on the newcomers, right?&quot; In the baseline she&#039;d kept her focus on the girls she actually wanted to teach and pretty much ignored the interlopers. That had not worked well at all. Maybe eventually it led to the lesson that you shouldn&#039;t use your friendships with important people to seem important, but the Cutie Mark Crusaders had been around Twilight and the other Elements of Harmony for years now without ever even thinking about trading on their relationships.</p><p class="double">And they almost certainly would have gone on not thinking about that if Diamond Tiara hadn&#039;t interfered.</p><p class="double">That smiling, gleeful, social-climbing filly was under her gaze now. Pity she and her yes-pony didn&#039;t realize that gaze had metaphorical crosshairs.</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Twilight smiled, &quot;what would you like help learning about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I just wanted to spend time with you, Princess!&quot; Diamond Tiara smiled. &quot;It&#039;s so wonderful to have a genuine princess in Ponyville!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I&#039;m afraid you don&#039;t get to spend time with me unless you&#039;re learning something,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;I hear you&#039;re an excellent acrobat. Why don&#039;t you show me what you can do?&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s grin vanished. &quot;Er... well, actually, I&#039;ve been feeling a little ill lately, so my butler-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah! Then I know exactly the thing!&quot; Twilight levitated a book off a shelf and set it down in front of the spoiled earth pony. &quot;<i>Get Better By Getting Fit!</i> Written by the leader of the Wonderbolts herself, Spitfire!&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara looked at the book, which was as thick as her foreleg. She opened it and read: &quot;&#039;Chapter One: You have already taken the first step to better health by lifting this twenty pound book. Now do it twenty more times.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, what will we be doing, then, Princess?&quot; Silver Spoon asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m sure you two can share!&quot; Twilight beamed. &quot;I&#039;m told you two do everything together, and I certainly wouldn&#039;t want to break the two of you up!&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara&#039;s eyes now looked frantically at the door. &quot;Princess, could you possibly help me with this? I can&#039;t possibly lift this book by myself...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#039;t be a good teacher if I did everything for my students,&quot; Twilight grinned. &quot;Besides, I know a couple of ponies who are much more qualified than I am to teach athletic fitness. They&#039;re top athletes in Ponyville&#039;s Equestria Games team!&quot; She stomped a forehoof three times on the wooden floor.</p><p class="double">Two pegasi burst out of Twilight&#039;s bedroom where they&#039;d been waiting, both wearing caps and whistles on strings. &quot;So, these the two acrobats you were talking about, Twi?&quot; Rainbow Dash grinned. &quot;I gotta say, they look a little soft to me!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m sure they&#039;ll do just fine,&quot; Fluttershy murmured.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eh, we&#039;ll see!&quot; Rainbow Dash picked up the book and dropped it on Diamond Tiara&#039;s back. The filly struggled to remain standing. &quot;That&#039;s what I thought! Soft and weak! But don&#039;t worry, we can fix that!&quot; She put her whistle to her lips. &quot;Five laps around Ponyville should put some spring in your step!&quot; She blew, the shrill whistle sending a shock through Diamond Tiara that lifted her off the floor. Her legs moved involuntarily under her, and she hit the ground galloping, out the door and down the street with Rainbow Dash following.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er, I&#039;ll just wait here for her,&quot; Silver Spoon said. As she turned to find a corner to lurk in, she came face to face with a very disappointed Stare.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not going to leave your friend to do it alone, are you?&quot; the horrible, horrible eyes asked in a voice like a silk-covered dagger.</p><p class="double">In a few moments Silver Spoon was on the run herself, Fluttershy right behind her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s taken care of that,&quot; Twilight said with deep satisfaction. &quot;Now, girls, let&#039;s get to your lessons. Scootaloo first.&quot; She looked around, only counting two Crusaders. &quot;What happened to Scootaloo?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She ran out the door after Rainbow Dash,&quot; Sweetie Belle said, pointing out into the street.</p><p class="double">Oops. She&#039;d forgotten about Scootaloo&#039;s hero worship. In the baseline Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had been out of town for weeks. Given the choice between spending time in a library doing much-hated research and running five laps around town with her idol... yeah, Twilight thought, I could have thought this through better.</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... well, we&#039;ll get back to her later. Let&#039;s see how your magic is coming along, Sweetie...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.8 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>995, Moonless Age. 996 years since Luna&#039;s disappearance.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight Woke up with her head in the fridge. Checking her memories, it seemed she was still a teenager at the moment, and still living with her parents. The &quot;chunk&quot; sound of the toaster reminded her why she was in the fridge, and she quickly found the jam.</p><p class="double">As she finished making her breakfast, Twilight went through what some loopers jokingly called start-up checks. She started casting specific scrying spells, using the horn glow of making toast to hide her actions if any of her family walked in. No Elements Awake yet, no signs from Celestia or Cadance either. Her loop memories tagged Nyx as her little sister this time, so she&#039;d check with her later in person. Scrying the moon for Luna...</p><p class="double">Twilight paused in putting the jam away. &quot;That can&#039;t be right...&quot; She muttered to herself. Surely she had just miscast the spell? Checking again, Twilight got the same result.</p><p class="double">Closing the fridge, Twilight asked aloud, &quot;Where&#039;s the moon?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A more thorough check of her memories, and a few weeks of studying, and Twilight felt she was on the right trail. While she hadn&#039;t made much headway on <i>where</i> the moon was, she was confident she knew <i>what</i> had happened to it. After all, she had helped Luna and Apple Bloom test fire it.</p><p class="double">As it turned out, a great many had been trying to find the moon for centuries. Magi-astrologists had pioneered entirely new fields of magic to look at the sky, built what could best be described as a magic powered Hubble Space Telescope, and just this year were testing some type of trans-atmospheric skyship.</p><p class="double">Of course, her new line of study didn&#039;t go unnoticed. While Twilight hadn&#039;t actually asked Princess Celestia any questions, she had still suggested a few books for her research. The awkward part however, came when her parents noticed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, dear, can we talk?&quot; Her mother asked, coming into her room one evening.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, of course.&quot; She replied, marking the page in her book before closing it. From the approach, Twilight expected her mother had decided it was time for The Talk.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, we&#039;re worried. This whole Moon thing, you haven&#039;t... you haven&#039;t gotten involved in one of those cults, have you?&quot; Okay, not The Talk she expected. &quot;I know you don&#039;t have many friends, and it might be the &#039;cool&#039; thing, but believe me, joining a Moon Cult is not the way.&quot;</p><p class="double">Right, Moon Cults, the other ponies with an interest in the moon. &quot;No! No, nothing like that. I&#039;m interested in the science side! I want to know where it went.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s assurances seemed to appease her mother. &quot;Oh thank goodness, we really were worried for a bit. Last thing we need is for you to end up like me. Mind, I met your Father because of the cult, but it was still a stupid part of my life.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You were in a cult?&quot; Awkward mother-daughter bonding, go!</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh yes, but I wasn&#039;t the most devout. I was mostly there for the parties.&quot; She started to smile a bit. &quot;Your Uncle led the guardponies that raided the building, I ended up meeting your Father sometime after.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The next afternoon, Twilight had sat down for a cup of tea with Princess Celestia, during a break in her lessons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess, can I ask a question?&quot; Twilight broke the silence.</p><p class="double">&quot;Certainly, my dear student. What&#039;s on your mind?&quot; Celestia asked, nibbling on some biscotti.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well... When Princess Luna returns to take the Chosen to the Promised Land, will I be able to continue our lessons via correspondence?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight almost managed to keep the innocent look on her face until Celestia had stopped sputtering. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.9 (Detective Ethan Redfield, Gulping)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Chess was a game. The ultimate goal of the game was to place the King in a position where it cannot escape and it will be captured in the next move. There were many strategies, most were centered around controlling the central four squares. Twilight wouldn&#039;t say she was a master at this game, but in her many eons spent looping, she had read almost every book written on the subject, probably on every subject at one time or another. She knew every strategy that could be employed, from the Sicilian&#039;s Defense all the way to the Stonewall Attack. In her boredom, she read every chessgame and even participated in chess tournaments, along with Checkers, Go and countless other board game tournaments.</p><p class="double">But even with her experience, she was losing this game. The two ponies were laying across from each other at a Canterlot Resort Hotel in the city&#039;s finest district. Twilight rarely came to this district since it was populated by the richest snobs in Equestria. It was only at an Awake Shining&#039;s request that she came, since the pony across from her had replaced Blueblood this loop. Said male pony had a dark tan coat with a chocolate mane and beard, sporting a unicorn horn. His flank held a black chess piece resembling the king, not too dissimilar from Lelouch&#039;s when he looped here but lacking the symbol for Geass. Another dozen moves were made by both players, when it finally came to an end with a knight and a rook sealing her king in place. The female anchor sighed, only for her to look up as the Stallion started clapping, &quot;Excellent game, Miss Sparkle, or should I say Princess Sparkle?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight replied, &quot;Twilight, if you would. If you must though, I&#039;m not a princess this time around, so Miss Sparkle will do, Mr. Xanatos...or do you prefer David or Chess Master?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Most call me Xanatos, you may as well. You&#039;re well versed in this game. The English Opening was inspired, not a common choice since reversing the Sicilian&#039;s defense to be used by white is quite complex a strategy. If I could rank you among the loopers I&#039;ve played, you&#039;d be at the same level of the girl I faced in the Fire Emblem Awakening loop, when I replaced Virion. Both of you favored protecting your individual pieces than protecting the King. An admirable trait, though unwise since in these loops, the anchors are the kings. If we lose the anchors, their loops will be lost forever.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight crossed her hooves, &quot;Do you have a point in there, Xanatos?&quot;</p><p class="double">Xanatos lifted the chess pieces and re-arranged them on the board, idly looking at the two kings, &quot;I always have a point, Twilight. If you overextend yourself in chess, you will create openings for your enemies to slip through, capturing the king. For example-&quot;</p><p class="double">The looper stood up, walked over to his dresser, pulled out two sphere like objects, &quot;This is an anti-magic generator, and the other a gravity generator that increases the weight of everything within it&#039;s radius. If I were to activate it, how would you counter me?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave a smirk, &quot;Shining knows I&#039;m here, and he knows to check in on me within the hour.&quot;</p><p class="double">Xanatos returned the smile, &quot;Good, but what if you were the only known looper, I induced an attack by Chrysalis long before her appointed time and had her replace one of the Elements of Harmony? Of course, if you didn&#039;t have back up such as your brother then you&#039;d have planned differently, but my point is – I wouldn&#039;t have just one plan, but several running in conjunction at the same time. What if it&#039;s in a universe where your powers are gone and subspace pocket inaccessible?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s head ran both scenarios at the same time, however Xanatos held up a hoof, &quot;Another time for that. My point is, always plan to win. Plan everything out days in advance. Practice every conceivable scenario and how it could go. Have multiple plans running at once. If plan A fails, Plans B through F may still succeed. Finally If you fail, have an out. Better to spend a loop in Eiken than your entire universe erased.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s worth noting that I have... Learned a modicrum of humility over these days.&quot; The bearded stallion flinches noticeably at this admission, something that Twilight had no trouble picking up on.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ve gotten on one of the First&#039;s bad sides, haven&#039;t you?&quot; Twilight&#039;s tone is surprisingly bereft of sympathy, sounding like she was speaking to someone who had built an extremely expensive house on a flood plain.</p><p class="double">&quot;Among others, yes. The problem with playing the Game is simple. Not everyone wants to play with you. Sometimes they&#039;re direct about it.&quot; A hoof comes up to rub his jaw, nudging it slightly to confirm that it is, indeed, whole. &quot;And that&#039;s if you&#039;re fortunate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight lets out a low, soft whistle. &quot;Finding out you were stuck in a time loop didn&#039;t really do much for your judgment, did it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not at first, no. And it did not help that my reputation tends to precede me. My name is, literally, synonymous with scheming. Complex scheming that operates entirely by eliminating the competition&#039;s winning conditions.&quot; He sighs, and shakes his head.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;ve learned to appreciate the small victories, I take it?&quot; Twilight&#039;s tone is more than a little sly, and there&#039;s really nothing Xanatos can do to object to her teasing, because really, that&#039;s his own fault.</p><p class="double">&quot;The value of being able to eat solid food over the course of an entire loop is well ingrained in my mind, yes. Also, checkmate.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s attempt to muffle her laughter cuts off sharply as she looks down at the board. &quot;...Was admitting to the drawbacks of being you something you did on purpose to distract me, or just you unconsciously seizing the opportunity after you&#039;d already gotten going with your thoughts?&quot;</p><p class="double">Xanatos just stared at the chessboard. &quot;...Truth be told, I don&#039;t know.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.10 (thewatcher)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Cadance?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are you watching a navy battle from a cloud?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Since a few certain loopers were visiting, I tried to compute possible matches for Ramna, but too many came up.&quot; Cadance rubbed at a circular bruise mark on her hock. “It exploded again.”</p><p class="double">&quot;And....?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, as it turned out, a few of the girls were... Unhappy with that result.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That still doesn&#039;t explain the ships. Where did you get them from any way?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applebloom. Well, you do remember the &#039;shipping wars&#039; of the Hub right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We decided to make it a bit more... Literal.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Below...</p><p class="double">The great ship <i>Silver Doubloon</i> sailed towards the <i>White Devil</i> - a smaller, but more powerful, frigate.</p><p class="double">&quot;For Ranma!&quot; cried Nabiki. And the sea dissolved into chaos.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.11 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight glared at Pinkie Pie. &quot;I want three Hay Burgers and two orders of fries.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned back at her. &quot;Aw, c&#039;mon, Twilight, you&#039;ll like this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What is it, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, you remember that loop where we replaced that fat detective and his assistant?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight remembered it very well. Twenty years of both being amazed and exasperated by the reminder that Pinkie Pie could actually sit down and focus her mind on things ran through her mind. &quot;Yes, I remember, but what does that have to do with-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I was thinking about all those recipies I learned in that Loop, and I wondered if I could adapt them to Equestrian cooking, so today I asked the boss if I could use his kitchen to experiment and he said yes but then I thought, &#039;Well, I&#039;ll eat practically anything, so I&#039;m not a good test of what&#039;s good and what isn&#039;t, so I need someone to try these recipes out, and who do I know who&#039;s a close friend and a really big eater,&#039; and then you walk in the door and I&#039;m like-&quot;</p><p class="double">Now Twilight remembered. In that Loop the brownstone house on West 35th Street, Manhattan, New York, had among other things been a center of private culinary extravagance. Pinkie had delighted in experimenting with their Swiss cook and sharing the results with close friends, acquaintances, and occasionally murder suspects. It was that kind of a Loop, and Pinkie was that kind of pony, even when she wasn&#039;t a pony.</p><p class="double">But some of those menus had been... er. Very er. With an extra side order of carnivore guilt.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie,&quot; Twilight stopped the pink party pony waitress in mid-ramble. &quot;The name of this restaurant is Hay Burger. I ordered three Hay Burgers with extra trademark. All I want is a nice, simple lunch.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, Twilight,&quot; Pinkie said, giving Twilight the biggest filly-eyes the Anchor had seen since Monkey D. Lufy had visited Equestria, &quot;won&#039;t you at least give them a try? My treat?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight surrendered. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie pulled the trolley over and lifted the dish covers. &quot;Rice fritters aux gratin with raspberry jam filling.&quot;</p><p class="double">Heavy, but tolerable. &quot;All right...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Beet and watercress salad with black pepper.&quot;</p><p class="double">Sweet and bitter at the same time; not one of Twilight&#039;s favorite flavor combinations. &quot;Er...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Apple Bordelaise with garlic and parsley.&quot;</p><p class="double">A flavor train wreck rolling down the tracks. &quot;Pinkie-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And finally, for dessert,&quot; Pinkie lifted the last dish cover, &quot;almond parfait made with fresh eggs.&quot; The dessert dish was large enough to serve four ponies, or at least two Twilights.</p><p class="double">As she said this a chicken popped her head over the edge of the table and gave Twilight the dirtiest look a bird can give a pony, which is to say pretty darn dirty.</p><p class="double">&quot;And Elizabeak says you gotta eat every last bit!&quot; Pinkie said. &quot;She doesn&#039;t want her eggs to go to waste.&quot;</p><p class="double">Could things possibly get any more awkward? Twilight wondered.</p><p class="double">Then, as she took her first reluctant bite of a rice fritter, the flashbulbs began going off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m sorry, Twilight,&quot; Pinkie said a week later.</p><p class="double">&quot;Three Hay Burgers and hay fries,&quot; Twilight said.</p><p class="double">&quot;I didn&#039;t know all those kids would go home and tell their parents what a princess likes to eat.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Three. Hay. Burgers. And hay fries,&quot; Twilight repeated.</p><p class="double">&quot;And that their parents would come to me begging for the recipies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hay burger. Hay fries. Three of each.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that the parents and kids would all get monstrous tummyaches when they tried to eat it all.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;My order, which is the food which I wish to consume, and no other, is for three hay burgers with fries, and nothing else.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And that the parents and kids would all blame you for the tummyaches. I&#039;m really, really sorry about that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just bring me my order so I can go back to not speaking to you.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.12 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy Awoke, and screamed.</p><p class="double">&quot;eep!&quot;</p><p class="double">Her voice didn&#039;t sound right. It was flat, buzzy, electronic... grating.</p><p class="double">Her body didn&#039;t feel right. For one thing, there was so very little of it.</p><p class="double">Her environment felt absolutely wrong. She was trapped in what felt like a cramped, dark can, with only a single visual input- a round viewscreen held something like half an inch away from her single eye.</p><p class="double">In that screen she saw a large dark metallic figure, vaguely cylindrical in shape, tapered towards a dome at the top with a large stalk protruding forward from the dome. It wiggled the stalk back and forth frantically, a suction grip arm and what looked like either a blender or a ray gun wiggling with equal anxiety below.</p><p class="double">&quot;HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY GET ME OUTTA THIS CONTRAPTION!&quot; Another flat voice shouted in panic from outside Fluttershy&#039;s prison.</p><p class="double">&quot;TWILIGHT? TWILIGHT, PLEASE TELL ME YOU&#039;RE OUT THERE!&quot; came another voice.</p><p class="double">&quot;I AM HERE- sorry, I&#039;m here, girls.&quot; Twilight&#039;s voice, though still flattened and a bit nasal, quickly adjusted itself to something recognizable. &quot;Who else is here besides Applejack and Rainbow Dash?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;M HERE,&quot; Fluttershy murmured loudly.</p><p class="double">&quot;HERE I AM, DARLINGS,&quot; Rarity said. &quot;WHAT HORRIBLE CREATURES ARE WE THIS TIME?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;First, girls, if you concentrate you can speak normally,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;We appear to be in the Doctor Who Loop. As Daleks.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT THE H- sorry,&quot; Applejack&#039;s voice shifted. &quot;What the hay are Daleks?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Paranoid, insane, hateful, genocidal, completely irredeemable aliens. The single most powerful force of evil this universe has to offer. One of a lot of reasons why this Loop is read-only,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;And Rarity, if you ask why we are Daleks, I can&#039;t be held responsible for the consequences.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Trust me, Twilight, that question is a far distant second to, &#039;Why aren&#039;t we Ascending at once and abandoning this entire Loop?&#039;&quot; Rarity had found the release to open her armor and was looking at herself in a reflective surface on one wall. &quot;I simply cannot contemplate an entire Loop looking like calamari in lime gelatin presented in a mold designed by a sadomasochist.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah!&quot; Rainbow Dash added. &quot;My Loop memories are all war and death and killing... and up until we Awoke, we were the last survivors of our race- and we were plotting to start it all over again! No way am I playing along with this Loop!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I gotta admit,&quot; Applejack said, &quot;compared to this Eiken is lookin&#039; pretty good. I&#039;d even take a turn in th&#039; Bureau over this!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Bite your tongue!&quot; Rarity replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;I ain&#039;t got one ta bite,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;I just got this kinda sucker tube thing hooked up to a catheter full of nutrients. I&#039;m so glad I can&#039;t taste it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Whatever!&quot; Rainbow Dash said. &quot;Let&#039;s blow this popsicle stand, already!&quot;</p><p class="double">Just then a sixth Dalek trundled into the room. Unlike the others, this one had one enormous gun on its chassis and no sucker-grip arm. Also, the chassis was pink from top to bottom, except for the gun. That was blue with gold stars. &quot;WHEEE!&quot; the new Dalek shrieked, firing its gun and sending confetti, party hats and cupcakes everywhere. &quot;I NEVER THOUGHT I&#039;D GET TO BE IN A LOOP WHERE I <b>WAS</b> THE PARTY CANNON!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Focus, Pinkie,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Your voice, watch your voice.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that about does it,&quot; Applejack moaned. &quot;I&#039;m with Rainbow. I don&#039;t think I can take five more minutes of a Loop with a fully weaponized Pinkie in it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No.&quot; Fluttershy moved her armor forward into the middle of the Cult of Skaro. &quot;We&#039;re staying.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What??&quot; Rainbow Dalek turned to face Fluttershy. &quot;WHY?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight,&quot; Fluttershy said, &quot;you said Daleks are the most powerful force of evil in this universe, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Rainbow Dash, you said we were the last survivors of our race, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She did say that, yes,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;But this is the Doctor Who universe. That won&#039;t last long. Daleks have gone extinct a lot of times, but they always come back.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then that makes it all the more important that we stay,&quot; Fluttershy continued. &quot;Especially if there are other evil aliens and things.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;There are. Lots,&quot; Twilight said. &quot;Cybermen, Weeping Angels, Sontarans, and all sorts of evil monsters and masterminds. And only the Doctor to stand against them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The Doctor... and now us,&quot; Fluttershy finished. &quot;Daleks want to conquer the universe... so let&#039;s conquer the universe... for good!&quot; She paced her armor back and forth along the floor. &quot;Instead of enslaving or exterminating races, we&#039;ll protect them from bad people. And we&#039;ll do it as non-lethally as possible. We kill nobody. If nice people resist, we don&#039;t fire back. If people don&#039;t want our help, we don&#039;t force it on them... but we provide it if we can. And we&#039;ll need someplace where prisoners can live in peace by themselves where they can&#039;t hurt anybody.</p><p class="double">&quot;But I think we can do it. And it&#039;s a lot better than just exterminating Twilight and ending the Loop early.&quot; The Stare didn&#039;t work through an eyestalk, but Fluttershy gave it a try anyway. &quot;We&#039;re better ponies than that anyway. That&#039;s the easy way out.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All right, I&#039;m game,&quot; Rainbow Dash said. &quot;But just before we Awoke we were talking about changing our genetic structure. Can we still do that? I don&#039;t want to spend my whole Loop in a dish if I can help it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Only if we can do it without anyone getting hurt,&quot; Fluttershy insisted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sleipnir sat at the cafe across from Twilight, while the next booth over filly Rarity fussed over Rainbow Dash&#039;s stylish dress, much to the elder pony&#039;s mortification. &quot;I&#039;m very sorry about what happened to you girls,&quot; the admin said. &quot;I was about to terminate that Loop myself when it crashed. Can you tell me what happened?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;as far as I can tell, the universe was destroyed by an uncontrolled surge of time vortex energy released by an uncontrolled Time Lord regeneration cascade.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, when the Doctor finally had to accept that there was such a thing as a good, noble, heroic Dalek, he couldn&#039;t cope with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I never knew that you could literally blow somepony&#039;s mind!&quot; Pinkie Pie chipped in as she floated past the table under a cluster of party balloons.</p><p class="double">&quot;Blow... his mind?&quot; Sleipnir asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;His head quite literally exploded,&quot; Twilight nodded. &quot;And regenerated. And exploded again. And every time he regenerated, he&#039;d look at us, shake his head, say, &#039;Nope,&#039; and boom, explode again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I... see,&quot; Sleipnir shook his head. &quot;I thought better of the Doctor than that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, an earlier incarnation probably wouldn&#039;t have had that problem,&quot; Twilight shrugged. &quot;But this was only two regenerations removed from the Time War, and he was pretty fragile mentally.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It probably didn&#039;t help that you greeted him by offering to help save the world for love and justice,&quot; Pinkie Pie said as she floated back over.</p><p class="double">&quot;Probably not,&quot; Twilight admitted, blushing. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">67.13 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Mister Xanatos, I am reminded of one of my good friends in another Loop...&quot; Celestia said as she gracefully navigated the room and decanted some exceptional Prench wine. &quot;He said something that I think applies here.&quot;</p><p class="double">Xanatos boggled as the peytral and tiara floated over his head and shoulders.</p><p class="double">&quot;As I was saying, Joshua said... &#039;A strange game.

<br /><p>68.1 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It took two weeks before they saw solid signs of progress. The color-change spell had started fading after the first week, very slowly shifting Fluttershy&#039;s mane and tail back to its normal pink during the course of the second one.</p><p class="double">Rarity, on Naruto&#039;s advice, had changed Fluttershy&#039;s hair color to a vividly bright red. The color didn&#039;t suit Fluttershy at <i>all</i>, but Kakashi seemed to relax more with the red than he did with Rarity&#039;s original choice of peach.</p><p class="double">The ninja had gotten a little <i>twitchy</i> once Fluttershy&#039;s natural pink-ness started becoming visible again, but Fluttershy&#039;s kind and caring self didn&#039;t change even though her mane did. Finally, it got to the point where Fluttershy was completely pink again and Kakashi didn&#039;t react to her at all.</p><p class="double">Everypony had been patting themselves on the back, but the next step would be much harder. Ponyville had many ponies in various shades of pink, including Pinkie Pie herself. Pinkie Pie had accidentally proven that Kakashi would need more help by setting him off herself when the urge to throw his &#039;<i>Welcome to Equestria/Hooray for Being a New Looper</i>&#039; party overwhelmed her better judgement.</p><p class="double">Luckily, Konoha&#039;s Number One Confusing Ninja had come up with a plan of his own. It was based off a prank Naruto had done to the Unawake Kakashi more times than he could ever remember. It only seemed fitting to use to help the Awake Kakashi now.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;YOSH!&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi...stared. Fluttershy had asked if he could get something from the shed (if he wasn&#039;t busy, and didn&#039;t mind the walk), but he couldn&#039;t remember what it was. Not after seeing...<i>this</i>.</p><p class="double">&quot;Eternal Rival! I am here to deliver a most Youthful Challenge!&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi was fairly sure he&#039;d seen this pony before, too. Even after extended Fluttershy exposure, the other shades of pink still set him <i>off</i>, but Kakashi could have sworn he&#039;d seen this pony around. Mostly peeking through Fluttershy&#039;s windows at him.</p><p class="double">The jumpsuit and bowl cut were nostalgically familiar, and Kakashi&#039;s reply was automatic.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hm? Did you say something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yosh! A most Hip and Youthful reply!&quot; &#039;Pinkie Gai&#039; announced, &quot;As expected of my Eternal Rival! Now, accept my Challenge!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...What challenge?&quot; Kakashi asked, warily.</p><p class="double">Pinkie pulled a large poster from nowhere.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pin the Tail on the Pony! And if I cannot beat you at it, I will make <i>one thousand balloon animals!</i>&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I still can&#039;t believe this worked,&quot; Twilight said, looking around Fluttershy&#039;s lawn.</p><p class="double">&#039;Pinkie Gai&#039; had challenged Kakashi to one party game after another. Then to a cupcake-eating contest. Right now they were doing a dance battle. Somehow in the middle of this, other ponies had arrived from Ponyville and the whole thing had turned into a full-fledged Pinkie Pie Party.</p><p class="double">Naruto&#039;s grin had gone from &#039;smug&#039; to &#039;foxy&#039; sometime around the limbo contest. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">68.2 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity Crisp?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Twilight Delicious?&quot; Rarity casually adjusted her stylish white Stetson hat.</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are we all part of the Apple family?&quot; Twilight fidgeted with her lavender neck scarf.</p><p class="double">The white unicorn paused for a moment, parsing her new memories before answering, &quot;Because when you gave Pinkie Pie the genealogy scrolls, she found out that most of the ponies in the Ponyville and Canterlot areas have a common ancestor. One Appleseed, who instead of just planting apple trees wherever he went..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ugh! I get it!&quot; Twilight groaned, &quot;Overly promiscuous stallions aside, what does this mean for us?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity Crisp casually watched as Apple Bloom, Scrumptious Belle, and Seedaloo played together, &quot;It means the next family reunion is going to be bigger than the Summer Sun Celebration.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">68.3 (Ghrathryn)</p><p class="double"> (Blytonverse continued)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">George had a slight smirk on her face as she faced the men that wanted her family’s gold for what had to be at least the fiftieth time that she could recall. They were, of course, in the little dungeon cell in Kirrin Castle, somewhere in the island’s network of underground passageways. As with the baseline, Lauren and Felicity were up on the surface while she and Rayne were down here, gathering the last few bits and dumping them into George’s subspace pocket, or they had been before the members of Greed International had shown up.</p><p class="double">“Jake! Look here!” One of the pair said. “You were right. The gold’s here all right. And how easy to take away! All in ingots! This is the most amazing thing we’ve ever found!”</p><p class="double">George rolled her eyes. What was left wasn’t even a fraction of what should be here, but of course with the loops these idiots wouldn’t recognise that fact. “Sorry to disappoint you boys, but you’re not going to get any of it.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah?” One of the pair, Jake probably since it wasn’t the one that had spoken the first time. “What makes you think you can stop us? You’re just a pair of kids.”</p><p class="double">George grinned, casting a quick look at Rayne. “Actually I’m a lot more now.” She said, Reaching for her Legacy and pulling on the magic around them, feeding it into her flame. Her target was the pistol that one of the pair pulled out, forcing the temperature of the air around it up until the metal started to bubble and melt.</p><p class="double">With the weapon out of the way, it would probably be easy to deal with the pair; particularly given they showed no signs of being anything other than normal ponies.</p><p class="double">“Hey! You can’t do that! Bats don’t have magic.”</p><p class="double">George smiled slightly at the pair of them, her eyes glowing redly, “Timmy, capture.”</p><p class="double">With a snarl, Timothy leapt at the men, shifting into his ‘dragon’ form mid-air and slamming them both to the ground.</p><p class="double">Rayne arched an eyebrow. “That was fast.”</p><p class="double">“Normally they’re a lot more annoying, but… two dragons against two… earth ponies did you call them?” Getting a nod from Rayne, she watched as Timothy knocked the pair out and bound them in chains of rock. “It’s rather bad for them. If we did it the normal way, Lauren would have to get a note and come down to rescue us. I don’t feel like dealing with the mess that will make, particularly if Felicity is anything like Anne is now we’re looping.” George shrugged, turning to stuff what remained of the gold in her subspace pocket.</p><p class="double">“So what do we do? Just leave them here?” Rayne asked as the two of them got ready to leave.</p><p class="double">“We usually leave them down here and wreck their boat so they won’t get away.” George replied as Timothy returned to the ‘normal’ Welsh border collie mongrel he was. “Let’s find the others.”</p><p class="double">Nodding, Rayne followed her back through the maze of passages under the castle, after locking the two would-be thieves in the cell.</p><p class="double">“Did you find it?” Lauren asked once the five of them had regrouped. “Where is the gold?”</p><p class="double">“Safe,” Rayne replied. “Though we did have a couple of people try to make trouble.”</p><p class="double">Felicity blinked. “Oh dear, I hope nobody was hurt too badly.”</p><p class="double">George shook her head. “The worst <i>might</i> be first or second degree burns to a hand.”</p><p class="double">“Oh my!” Felicity gasped.</p><p class="double">“Beyond that, they’re knocked out, bound and locked up. We should deal with the pair’s boat so they can’t make a swift get away if they manage to break out.” She grinned, pulling a length of rope from the pocket. “And I know the best way to.”</p><p class="double">Leading the group to the cove the Five normally landed in, she nodded, seeing the motorboat left there. It didn’t take them long to have it tied to their own rowboat, nor for them to be heading out into the bay.</p><p class="double">“Well,” Rayne said, sitting in the motorboat as George guided it through the rocks surrounding the island and into the bay. “Since we’ve got a bit of time before anything else happens, I was thinking. Don’t say anything, Fluttershy; I’ve heard most of them.” The last was an aside to the yellow Pegasus. “Given most of the things you’ve told me about seem to be handled easily in loop, even for your baselines; do you think that any of the others would be willing to open the loop up as another sanctuary?”</p><p class="double">George frowned. “I won’t speak for anyone outside the Five, since I don’t know them too well, but I can see Julian and Anne agreeing to have this as a sanctuary.” She shifted slightly, ignoring the calls from the large ship they passed. If things followed baseline, those sailors would probably go to the island. She glanced up, taking note of the name so she could tell the police later. “The thing is we’ve been told how powerful some of the older loopers are. Even with the five of us being what we are, I don’t know if we could handle them without some serious help.”</p><p class="double">Rayne nodded, twitching her tail. “I know, George, and Equestria will help as much as we can. One of our things is making as many friends as possible, because we’re stronger together, working in harmony, than anyone is alone.” She reached over, placing a hand on George’s shoulder, Felicity doing the same from the other side.</p><p class="double">“I think a lot of the loopers would be glad of somewhere that they can rest, somewhere that is human controlled most of the time.” Felicity said. “I don’t know if there is any way we can help you or the others here make sure the loops are safe for others, but Rainbow is right. Equestria won’t leave our friends hanging.”</p><p class="double"><i>:This loop seems to be a fusion of all our groups, pack mate.:</i> Timothy put in, placing his head in George’s lap, leaving Lauren with no way to get in for now. <i>:We can talk to the others, let them know the idea and let them decide if they can handle things. When our pack mates return, we can talk to them and decide whether </i>we <i>can handle everything and the next time things fuse we can pass a message on.:</i> He pointed out.</p><p class="double">“Come on, old thing,” Lauren said, getting an amused snort from George at how typically Julian or Dick that phrase was. “It can’t be all bad.”</p><p class="double">George smiled slightly. “I won’t answer for anyone else, but I can see about sending the offer along to those I know and we should be meeting the girls from Malory Towers in a few weeks so you can put the proposition to them yourselves.” She said, taking a moment to stroke Timothy’s head before focusing on getting them back to shore.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight sighed as she looked up at the cave that the red dragon typically slept in. They hadn’t been able to properly test whether Anne was able to use the Element of Kindness thanks to Luna being awake. Something that was both good and bad. Right now though, they had another problem, namely a dragon that was often a pain in the tail to get to move on. Tree but she hated dealing with this some days.</p><p class="double">“So normally this guy just shows up out of nowhere and decides to sleep here?” Julian asked, getting a nod from Twilight. “I think I might have a way to convince him to leave.” He said, frowning slightly as he looked into the cave. It was large, but not so large that he couldn’t do what he was planning. “Dragons here are vulnerable to cold, right?” Once again he got a nod.</p><p class="double">Grinning, Julian whistled as he walked towards the cave, his body starting to take on a blue-white colouration. Twilight shivered as he passed her, glancing back at Dick and Anne, who both shrugged their wings.</p><p class="double">Entering the cave, he let the cold spread. From their experimenting with their abilities, he knew he could <i>cool</i> a volume of around thirteen hundred cubic metres, all he really needed was to do that enough to convince the dragon that staying here wasn’t a good plan.</p><p class="double">The dragon in question tossed and turned a bit as the area around it started getting cold, ice forming and cracking on his scales before he blinked open his eyes and focused on the small pony in front of him. “Why do you disturb me, pony?”</p><p class="double">“I apologise for the interruption of your nap, but the local residents have requested you move on… and possibly have someone take a look at your nose and throat.” Julian responded politely.</p><p class="double">“And why should I care about pitiful little ponies?” The dragon asked, sounding somewhat amused by the stallion in front of him.</p><p class="double">Julian shifted slightly. “Ponies, much like my own species, aren’t individually powerful outside a chosen few.” He admitted. “However, you happen to have several of those chosen ones waiting outside.” He pointed out, his breath starting to steam in the air as the cavern’s temperature dropped another few degrees. “And if you hadn’t noticed yet, it’s getting cold in here. Soon enough it will be cold enough that your body starts shutting down.” He raised his head to look the dragon in the eye. “I can keep active in temperatures below minus one hundred degrees centigrade, can you?”</p><p class="double">The dragon shivered, hearing something crackle on his scales. “You’re bluffing. No <i>pony</i> could do such.”</p><p class="double">“I’m not a pony, sir.” Julian responded. “I am a dragon, but not one like you. Where you revel in fire and flame, I work best in temperatures that would make most others hide away to try to keep warm.” He pointed out, twitching his tail.</p><p class="double">It was at that point that the dragon noticed that Julian’s eyes looked like those of a frozen corpse, almost pure white. The temperature dropped a bit more and the dragon noticed ice coating the cave floor along with his treasures.</p><p class="double">“The other option would be for us to fight, though I would prefer it didn’t come to that.” Julian continued, not remotely bothered by the cold as the dragon picked his paws off the pile of gems and coins in a crackling of ice.</p><p class="double">“I…” The dragon looked around as an enclosed winter continued to encroach. “Fine, release your winter, pony. You have won this round.” Getting a nod, the dragon watched in surprise as winter seemed to evaporate from his cave.</p><p class="double">“A pleasure doing business with you, sir,” Julian smiled, turning to leave.</p><p class="double">“Wait…” The dragon held up a paw. “Are you really a dragon?”</p><p class="double">Julian grinned. There were a few moments of morphic confusion as his wings changed, the hair of his tail shortened while the tail itself stretched out and thickened. Not long after there stood a white and blue scaled dragon, around thirty to fifty feet in length stood in the pegasus’ place. “Ilistast the Ice Walker at your service.” He rumbled, bowing his head slightly. “Of the Avalon Brood.”</p><p class="double">“Slaryrrlus the Red,” The dragon introduced himself, his tail flicking. “I will admit, I never imagined I would meet another dragon in this region and I have never heard of one that uses cold like you.”</p><p class="double">“I doubt you will find too many cold wyrms in these parts, though I do know of at least three other dragons here.” Julian admitted. “Spykoran, a young dragon raised by ponies and two of my brood siblings, Fenynast of the Dark Forest and Kanrorarl the Storm Wind. All three are outside along with the Elements of Harmony.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Surprisingly they had managed to get hold of at least some of just about every group that existed in their universe, passing the message on, which of course had led to more and more questions. Finally George had gotten fed up of them all and just asked the ‘leaders’ of each group to come down to Kirrin. Being part pony had really speeded that up for a number of them, which was why they were back on Kirrin Island, in the ruined castle’s courtyard with her and the three from Equestria in front of a mass of anthro-ponies.</p><p class="double">“How many of them are there?” Rayne asked, looking out at the group.</p><p class="double">George frowned, shifting slightly. “Somewhere on the high side of a hundred, possibly over two hundred,” She replied, looking out at the group.</p><p class="double">“But… no loop has that many loopers.” Felicity whispered.</p><p class="double">“Actually this <i>loop</i> has ei… nine loopers.” George pointed out, remembering Jo at the last second. “The thing is you’re talking about the entirety of our ‘universe’ that links to ‘normal’ Earth so you’ve got something like seven to ten, possibly more actual loops that can and probably often do run together, each with their own loopers.” She wasn’t exactly sure how their universe worked, but she knew of two boarding schools and five holiday adventurer groups counting the Five themselves. “Think about it, there’s the Famous Five, the Secret Seven, the Adventurous Four, the Five Find-Outers, the Trents and Mannerings or Cunninghams or whatever those four call themselves and the schools, Malory Towers and St Claire’s and those are the ones <i>I</i> know of. I wouldn’t be surprised to find there’s a few others.”</p><p class="double">Rayne nodded as Felicity blinked. “Even if it’s only the anchor for each area this whole thing is almost like the Star Wars linked loops and possibly how the Star Trek ones are set up… the latter set at least.” She agreed. “If there are loopers for Star Trek, and Slepinir says there are, then there’s at least three for the different main Enterprises, if the station and that other ship have their own anchors that’s potentially another twenty or so loopers focusing on bridge crews.” She pointed out before looking out at the crowd again and sighing as the parrot decided to let out an imitation of a train whistle. That bird was already annoying her.</p><p class="double">Seeing everyone settling themselves down, she took a deep breath and let it out slowly. This would be the first time she had given the Looping Multiverse 101 to such a large group, heck she doubted Twilight had given that talk to such a large group. Stepping out, she quickly ascended to alicorn and let off a firecracker spell to get everyone’s attention as the others joined her. “Thank you.” Rayne said, looking around at the group, some of which were obviously adults, most seemed to be children. “My name, for this loop is Rayne Kirrin, normally I go by Rainbow Dash, fastest pegasus — or alicorn — in Equestria. With me I have Fluttershy, one of the other Equestrian loopers, Lightning Dust, a non-looper from Equestria and George Kirrin of the Famous Five, a local looper along with her dog, Timothy.</p><p class="double">“The reason you’re all here is because the universe is broken, the result of which is that we are all stuck repeating a certain amount of time again and again, sometimes in different ways.” Rayne looked around at the group, making sure they were paying attention before glancing back to see Felicity had set up a projector and had it running the introductory slide show. “I’ll try to make this quick since I’m not that good at public speaking. Reality as you know it is one universe of, literally, thousands. Under all of them is a super computer call Yggdrasil, unfortunately <i>something</i> broke the computer so the people that control it have put it in a kind of safe mode so it keeps working while they fix whatever broke. That safe mode is what caused the loops.”</p><p class="double">“Every loop has an anchor,” Felicity stepped forwards, switching the slides. “That person, whoever it is amongst your group, will <i>always</i> loop. That means that if anyone is likely to gain a lot of power or go insane from boredom, it will be the anchor.”</p><p class="double">Rayne nodded, taking over again. “From what George has told me, her section of this universe has looped maybe fifty to a hundred times, I presume most of the rest of you are about the same.” That got a number of nods from some people in the crowd. “What we have here is a Linked Loop, meaning that while each group here will be independent, there’s a high chance that something like this will happen, where you’re all together.”</p><p class="double"></p><p>“From what I was told,” George cut in, flicking her tail. “Is that loops tend towards one of three types in the main. Universe, meaning they’re just what happens normally or a variation of it, fused, like this, where either people or concepts will jump from one universe to another.” She looked around at the audience. “I presume most of you freaked out when you woke up at the beginning of the holiday as bipedal ponies.” Getting more nods, she snorted in amusement. “Yeah, it does seem strange or as if everyone got completely drunk, but it’s something to do with the way things fuse. Don’t count on staying human or even looking the same if you do. You will want to keep an eye out for tricks you can pick up, particularly in game loops since they don’t show often and can give a lot of tricks. You <i>don’t</i> want to muck things up too much though. Apparently there’s punishment loops out there and they’re nasty.”</p><p class="double">“They are,” Rayne shuddered. “We tend to end up in a school for guys that want serious eye candy. How those people can handle the weight on their chests normally I don’t know. There’s also a lobotomised variant of our home loop or a version where we, for <i>some</i> reason try invading Earth and turning humans into ponies.</p><p class="double">“Given all that, as soon as you’re aware you’ve loops, check your memories. There might be something there that explains a variation on what you’re used to or explains a bit about who and what you are if you end up outside your normal loop.” Rayne continued. “Also, if you ever end up in a universe known as the hub or heck anywhere that has books, try to get as many ‘fiction’ books as you can same with movies, games or television programs. Loop backups are stored in media on other loops so you can find out a lot beforehoof. You should also know that everyone that loops has a subspace pocket; it’s the only way to take things between loops. <i>Don’t</i> put anything organic in there unless it’s dead and under stasis. You don’t know what will happen in there. Be aware that you won’t fit everything in a pocket all the time; it will take time before you can put mass amounts of stuff into one.</p><p class="double">“I know some of the old timers can fit planets into their pockets, new loopers might be unlucky enough to only fit a couple of pieces of jewellery.” Rayne finished, flicking her tail. “The last thing before I open up to questions is that Equestria is a sanctuary loop and from what I’ve heard from George, most everything here can be handled in baseline so we would like to ask you whether you would be willing to be a second set of sanctuaries. I know you may not be able to handle old and insane loopers so Equestria will likely help out as much as we can, but if you are willing and can handle some, it will give us a break and allow the older loopers a chance to relax.”</p><p class="double">“You don’t have to answer now,” Felicity said gently. “We don’t mind waiting for you to think things over.” She looked around. “Why don’t we answer whatever questions you have first?” She suggested, getting several people raising their hands in response.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Leaning back from his console, the horned dragon frowned as he watched the development of one of the new loop sets he was in charge of. He knew that the Equestrians had designated their loop as a sanctuary to all but those most determined to cause trouble, but this was the first time he had heard of any of them trying to spread that. It was a good idea; many of the older loopers were close to breaking or had broken at least once. The question though, was how could a group of human children handle those with near unlimited power? Equestria had ways to deal with it, 50s Earth didn’t, even counting in the fact that they had a few dragons.</p><p class="double">The most obvious thing to do would be set up a power limiter on that set of loops, similar to the ones on Eiken, but that wouldn’t necessarily solve the problem. There was probably also going to need to be people that could handle people that were a mess psychologically. How would be the best way to do that?</p><p class="double">He flicked his tail, frowning. What could they do to mitigate the trouble from people like Sakura? What could they do to deal with the potential of someone like Leah from the Twilight series? Maybe it was time he spoke to Slepinir along with the others whose likenesses were used as sires for the Fireborn dragons.</p><p class="double">“Caranoch keep an eye on the loop in progress and make sure nothing nasty can access it.” He ordered the small draconic serpent that normally stuck with him. “I need to talk to Tiamat, Jormungand, Ladon, Ryu, Dambala and the others, then talk to Slepinir to see if we can come up with a way to handle the possibility of those loopers choosing to make their linked loop a sanctuary like the Equestria one.” He ordered, shifting into a horned, human like creature. It was easier to move through areas in his alternate form.</p><p class="double">“Right, tell me what happens, Cernunnos…” Caranoch looked over at his companion. “Or should it be Herne?” He asked, causing Herne to roll his eyes as he left the room.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Ursa Minor had failed to materialise at the end of Trixie’s usual first visit to Ponyville, something that everyone Awake and used to Equestrian loops had taken with a sigh of relief, right up to the point when a living storm had rolled out of the Everfree in its place.</p><p class="double">Shaking off the flash blindness from getting smacked in the muzzle by a lightning bolt, Dick looked up at the creature that had appeared, pinning his ears flat as it roared. “What <i>is</i> that?” He asked Twilight, who was watching the display with the air of someone that wasn’t happy about being sideswiped by events.</p><p class="double">“A Tempest. We encountered one once, it’s made of wild weather magic and makes the timber wolves in the Everfree look smart by comparison.” Twilight replied, scowling up at the living storm cloud. “The last time Rainbow and Lightning hit it with a double Sonic Rainboom. I don’t know how we can deal with it this time, at least not without ascending.”</p><p class="double">“If it’s Tainted weather, I’ll deal with it.” Dick growled, his hide starting to writhe as he pulled on his dragon form. Another bolt of lightning lit the sky, the terrible crack of it splitting the air covering whatever Twilight might had said as Dick leapt into the air, shedding his pony form in favour of becoming a silvery dragon as he beat his wings up into the sky.</p><p class="double">Reaching the same height as the rogue storm, he Reached out with his Legacy, scanning for any weaknesses. He could <i>taste</i> its Taint from where he was, niggling at the back of his throat. Unfortunately there didn’t seem to be any obvious weaknesses to the construct beyond rip out the heart of its weather magic. Dick’s eyes narrowed as another lightning bolt sizzled the air. He was a Storm Lord, it was a storm, he should be able to take it apart, if he remembered things from the time of Avalon properly.</p><p class="double">Closing his eyes, Dick felt his body start to become insubstantial as he used more of his Legacy. Reaching out to the Tempest, he felt around the cloud form for a moment before using the Legacy to slice one of its twister arms off. The creature roared in response.</p><p class="double">Another lightning bolt lanced through the sky, this one passing through Dick’s ‘body’ and fizzling out as he drew its power into himself. Narrowing his eyes, he formed a blade of wind and sent it through the Tempest in response, moving in behind it to blast the thing with a lightning bolt of his own.</p><p class="double">That was when things <i>really</i> got loud. The Tempest, as Twilight had said, wasn’t smart, most of the time its attacks were as straight forwards and predictable as a run-away big-rig. Dick on the other hand dodged and jinked around most of its attacks, reading them through his Legacy as he used it to slice pieces off the colossus. Cutting or disrupting the weather magic creating it, cleansing what he could as the storm cloud shrunk in on itself and finally disappeared as he swatted it with a fore paw.</p><p class="double">Back winging in to land, Dick shifted back to his pegasus form and grinned at Twilight. “One rogue storm dispersed.” He commented dryly before his stomach growled. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I am decidedly hungry so I’m going to get something to eat.” He added turning to do just that as the other Ponyvillians started cheering for him.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twitching her tail, Darrell Rivers looked around platform 7, watching the unawake girls going through their usual routines for the start of the term at Malory Towers, completely ignoring the fact that they were usually human. Even with the talk they had gotten a couple of weeks ago on Kirrin Island, it was strange knowing that she was a human and yet she and everyone else were anthro-ponies.</p><p class="double">“Hallo Darrell,” Alicia’s voice sounded from behind her, making her jump slightly. “Sorry about that old thing.”</p><p class="double">Turning, Darrell gave Alicia a look. “I do wish you wouldn’t do that.”</p><p class="double">Alicia shrugged her bat-like wings. “It just seems natural like this.” She replied before shifting slightly. “Have you seen any of the others yet?”</p><p class="double">“We’re only missing Sally and Gwendoline from our normal group and knowing Sally…” She trailed off as they both recalled what happened to Sally Hope in their baseline. “Other than that, it’s just the Kirrins, apparently there’s five of them and a dog.”</p><p class="double">Scanning the crowd again, Alicia twitched her tail as she noticed someone she recognised from the meeting. “I say, do you think that’s Sally?” She asked, pointing out another anthro-pony, this one with a horn instead of wings, along with an ice-blue mane and a light purple coat.</p><p class="double">“One way to find out,” Darrell replied. “Oi, Sally!” Getting a wave in response, she waited until the other pony reached them. “Good to see you, is everything alright?”</p><p class="double">“Actually yes,” Sally replied. “Daphne’s about Felicity’s age this time out, so I apparently got over my jealousy a long time ago.”</p><p class="double">“That’s good,” Darrell sighed in relief. Sally unawake and at baseline wasn’t fun because of the jealousy she had against her new-born and somewhat sickly little sister. Even when Sally was Awake, things weren’t nice for her that first term at Malory Towers because of that. “What do you suppose will happen if Gwendoline ends up doing this looping business?”</p><p class="double">Alicia shuddered. “I hope we don’t find out. She’s a piece of work as it is.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but she does get better after her father ends up sick.” Sally pointed out. “If she can learn from that, maybe she can actually be less of an ass than usual.” She continued before looking up to see a group of mares, one of whom had a rainbow coloured mane. “And it looks like the Kirrins are here.”</p><p class="double">“My word,” Alicia blinked as Darrell and Sally waved the newcomers over. “I never knew our school uniform could look so strange.”</p><p class="double">Rayne snorted in amusement, catching the tail end of that as she and the others came up to the trio. “It probably looks fine on humans, at least compared to some I’ve seen.” She grimaced. “I remember being in the Potterverse once, got a look at the one for Harry’s cousin’s uniform. It was ugly and it had the same colours.”</p><p class="double">“It probably depends on how they do things.” Jo pointed out. “This is mostly brown or white with some orange so it doesn’t really clash.”</p><p class="double">George arched an eyebrow at Jo, “Since when are you into fashion, old girl?”</p><p class="double">Jo shrugged her wings. “Blame your mother.” She replied, causing George to roll her eyes.</p><p class="double">“So what er… what normally happens for you girls?” Felicity asked, looking between the three that normally went to Malory Towers.</p><p class="double">“Well, there’s not really much to do here apart from wait around. We’re still missing Gwendoline.” Darrell said, nodding to George’s mother as she came up to say good-bye to the Kirrins. “That’s usually a show since Gwendoline’s mother spoils her rotten.”</p><p class="double">“After we get to Malory Towers, it’s pretty much boarding school.” Sally shrugged her shoulders. “What you call baseline has me being jealous of my little sister, which fortunately won’t happen this time. We see Alicia pull a few tricks, including playing deaf.”</p><p class="double">Alicia grimaced. “I’m not doing that one this time, it’s bad enough when I get water logged ears as a human.”</p><p class="double">Darrell nodded, patting Alicia’s shoulder. “Beyond that, Gwendoline annoys me by dunking Mary-Lou, our ‘mouse’ girl.”</p><p class="double">“Watch out if Darrell starts glinting at you, it usually means she’s cross.”</p><p class="double">Darrell rolled her eyes at Alicia’s comment and ignored the snort of laughter from Sally. “We get through most of the term okay, then Sally ends up needing an operation,” She grimaced. “My temper gets the best of me and she’s probably not well from stress.”</p><p class="double">“I wasn’t,” Sally interrupted. “And I’ve told you, I forgave you years ago, Darrell.” She continued, giving her friend a hug. “Beyond those incidents, I don’t think there’s much else that’s really big. Well, except that Gwendoline likes trying to snuggle up to people she thinks are rich or popular and usually it ends poorly for her. I think Bill said she might show up early this time when we were leaving Kirrin.”</p><p class="double">“Bill?” Lauren asked.</p><p class="double">“Wilhelmina Robinson. She starts in our third year mostly and she’s horse mad.” Darrell explained before snorting in amusement. “She’s probably one of the few that were actually excited to wake up a pony.”</p><p class="double">George snickered as Timothy barked a laugh. <i>:That sounds much like some people we’ve met.:</i> He commented to George.</p><p class="double">“Finally,” Alicia sighed, noticing Gwendoline and her mother had finally arrived, the former of which had her blonde mane half way down her back. “Now <i>they</i> are here, we can get going.” With a bit of urging, the nine of them made their way onto the North Tower carriage of the train, Darrell, Sally and Alicia pointing out Gwendoline once they were settled, letting the Kirrins watch as the spoilt girl had her send off. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">68.4 (Ghrathtyn)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke and blinked in surprise as her Loop Memories came in. “Well…” She started, raising insubstantial hooves to look through them. It wasn’t the first time she had been a ghost, or even looped in dead or near it, but this was a bit different.</p><p class="double">Looking up, she frowned at the house in front of her. According to her memories, she was supposed to take a team of four spirits to scare everyone living in the house out into the streets.</p><p class="double">“Twilight?” A voice came from behind her, causing her to turn around, finding ghostly versions of Big Mac, Rainbow Dash, Angel Bunny and Gummy floating in the sky. “What’s going on?”</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged her wings. “I’m not sure Dash, but I think we’re ghosts and we’re supposed to scare the ever living sap out of anyone and everyone in there.” She waved her hoof at the house. “Let me have a look around, I think we can check the place out with impunity, but if we start <i>doing</i> anything we have to keep people scared otherwise we get knocked away.”</p><p class="double">The others nodded and Twilight floated in through the wall of the house. It seemed the place was one of the larger Canterlot College houses where they housed mares. A quick check revealed there were ten mares hanging around, chatting, sleeping or whatever. What she wasn’t expecting was grumbling from the basement. Floating through the floor, she blinked at the sight of Applejack, as ghostly as the rest of them, but chained to what looked like a tree stump.</p><p class="double">“Consarnit.” The orange ghost muttered. “Why. Won’t. You. Drop. Anything?” She asked, bucking at where the rest of the trunk <i>should</i> have been.</p><p class="double">“Did you try bucking the orchard while half asleep again?” Twilight asked, making Applejack jerk around to face her.</p><p class="double">“Twilight?” Applejack asked, getting a nod in return. “Thank goodness. Please tell me you know something about this? I keep thinking I need to buck this tree and I can’t.”</p><p class="double">“There’s no tree there, AJ.” Twilight pointed out, motioning at the stump.</p><p class="double">Applejack looked back at what she was chained to. “Oh…” She stared. “Um… help?”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “You said you need to buck something, right?” She asked, getting a nod from her friend. “Well… I might be able to come up with something, but I need to look things up.” She reached over to pat Applejack’s shoulder. “We’ll get you out of here, just hold on.”</p><p class="double">Floating back to the others, she checked her in loop memories and pulled a book out of her mane. Flicking through it, she frowned. From what it said about the other four, she had a horde, a gremlin, a spook and a spectre. It looked like Applejack was some sort of phantom. At least AJ had the ability to make plants grow, though it would take a bit to get the energy together for that it seemed, at least the version they needed.</p><p class="double">“Alright everypony,” Twilight started as she joined the rest. “It looks like we’re a haunting team and I’m the leader. It also looks like we’re supposed to clear this house as a test… from Nightmare Moon.” The last got shocked looks. “Yeah, I don’t get it either.” Twilight admitted. “There’s ten mares in there to scare away, and we need to build the scares up to free AJ. She’s chained to a tree stump.” Rainbow burst out laughing at that and Twilight cracked a grin.</p><p class="double">Looking around at her team, Twilight grinned. This could be a fun loop, and a chance to really let loose and prank people without any problems. “Rainbow, see if you can get a storm rolling around the house, keep it to low winds and thunder for now. I don’t have the energy for you to really let loose yet.”</p><p class="double">“Got you.” Rainbow spread her wings as a glowing tether linked her to the grounds around the house. The wind started picking up, bringing dark clouds with it.</p><p class="double">“Angel, see if you can get some of your friends to run through the house. Gummy, you go upstairs and make the stereo in the upstairs lounge area dance.” Twilight ordered, getting nods from both animals. Shrieks soon echoed from the house, causing the mare to grin. “Mac, why don’t you introduce yourself to the nice mares?” She asked, sending some plasm to the stallion to allow him to manifest.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sitting in a rundown old schoolhouse, Twilight looked around at the ‘team’ she was supposed to be leading, which seemed to be made up of most of her looping friends, though there were certainly missing members.</p><p class="double">“Alright, I don’t know exactly what’s going on here but…” She trailed off as Nyx and Luna flashed into view, both looking as insubstantial as everyone else. “Hello Luna, good to see you Nyxie.” She held her hooves out to get a hug from her daughter. “Either of you know what’s going on?”</p><p class="double">“Not all of it,” Luna admitted. “It seems that we’re part of the supernatural world this time and I have control over that while Celestia is <i>trying</i> to make sure it’s forgotten by mortals.” She shrugged her wings. “Apparently thou art a new Ghost Master in mine service, though I don’t recall how or why thou joined me.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Yeah, I got that much. I still don’t know what the eucalyptus is going on though.”</p><p class="double">Luna twitched her tail, then flattened her ears against her head. “Before Nyx and I Awoke, it seems Nightmare Moon launched a campaign of terror against the mortals and thou were sent to Canterlot.” She said, wincing. “There are at least five other groups out in other cities and more scattered in the towns, which is why thou only had the ponies here apart from fair Applejack.”</p><p class="double">“I think the best way to do this is see what shows up.” Nyx commented from where she snuggled into her mother. “Though I don’t know what will happen if you don’t manage things.”</p><p class="double">“I guess we’ll see.” Twilight sighed, looking around at the others. Nine ghosts to scare a city wasn’t much.</p><p class="double">Luna nodded before blinking and summoning a pile of gold, glowing… something. “Apparently this is Gold Plasm; it is used to empower thine underlings.” She explained quickly.</p><p class="double">“Empower, how?” Rainbow asked, floating forwards to look at the plasm.</p><p class="double">“It grants you more powers.” Nyx explained briefly. “You noticed that everypony has more ‘levels’ than they have powers, right momma?” She asked Twilight, getting a nod. “Well if you use Gold Plasm, you can grant one pony a new power for an amount of it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight frowned. “Dash, what abilities do you have?”</p><p class="double">Dash frowned. “Fog, Thunder Clap, Gather Winds, Rattle Chains, Jinx, Kinesis… I think I can have Rain, Flood and Hail, I’m not entirely sure what else there is.”</p><p class="double">“So if I used this Gold Plasm on Dash, I could give her one of those three?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Yup.” Nyx responded.</p><p class="double">“That’s pretty cool.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded, flicking her tail. “Alright,” She looked around, seeing Dash, Mac, Angel, Gummy, AJ, Sweetie Belle, Rarity, Berry Punch and Fluttershy. “Can all of you go through what you know about your abilities and potential abilities and decide what will work best for you?” She asked her friends before turning back to Luna. “I presume this wasn’t just a social visit, Luna.”</p><p class="double">Luna shook her head. “Unfortunately not. There is an older house near the outskirts of Canterlot that drew our attention. It seems that one of the past owners murdered ponies there to keep herself company. She was getting old and more than a little senile at the time.” She explained, grimacing as she waver a hoof at the table, causing a map to appear on it, a house rising from it with a glow around it. A moment later, a black-glowing, bat-infested house grew up as well. “We need you to take six of your team and find a way to reveal those killed by that old mare to the police, <i>without</i> scaring anypony away if possible.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grimaced. That didn’t sound good at all, “Alright, Dash, Berry, Fluttershy, Mac, Angel and AJ, let’s see what happened here.”</p><p class="double">Opening a portal, Luna twitched her tail. “Good luck, Twilight.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">68.5 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was walking down Ponyville going over her mental checklist of the Summer Sun Celebration for this Loop when she was bowled over by an IPBPP (Intra-Ponyville Ballistic Pinkie Pie).</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight-Twilight-Twilight-Twilight-Twilight-Twilight-Twilight-Twilight-Twilight!!!&quot; the hyperactive pony projectile yammered from atop her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ow...&quot; Twilight tried to shake the pink birdies from her head.

Oh, we had so much fun that Loop I had with them and I can&#039;t wait to introduce you!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s great Pinkie!&quot; Twilight wheezed as her friend all but did a jig on her chest. &quot;Could you let me up now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right,&quot; Pinkie slid off and let her friend stand up.</p><p class="double">&quot;So can I use the library for their party? Huh? Can I, can I, can I, can I?&quot; Pinkie was vibrating with so much excitement, Twilight expected her to blast off at any moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sure,&quot; Twilight agreed. &quot;Feel free to invite them to our planning session regarding Nightmare Moon too.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ohhh, they&#039;d like that!&quot; Pinkie nodded, before gasping comically. &quot;Pizza! I need to get pizza!&quot; she yelled as she dashed off.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pizza?&quot; Twilight wondered to herself. &quot;Not her usual fare... Wonder if it&#039;s something the new loopers like?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash was on her way to Twilight&#039;s library with Tank in tow. She&#039;d taken to adopting the tortoise right off the bat most Loops, and for some reason Pinkie said it would be a good idea to bring him to meet the new loopers. When pressed, Pinkie had admitted she had no idea why it seemed like a good idea, just that it did. Another one of her semi-random bursts of intuition probably.</p><p class="double">Upon entering, she identified the new loopers immediately. Four earth pony stallions with coats in varying shades of green and wearing colored mask/headband hybrids kind of stood out. As did the elderly diamond dog – who looked fairly rat-like – wearing a pretty worn, but still well cared for gi. Compared to that, the unicorn mare with a yellow coat and red mane practically blended in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; the mare was talking to Twilight. Rainbow noted that she had a microphone cutie mark. &quot;With all the different variations of myself that I Loop into, I have trouble keeping my Loop memories straight. I often find myself defaulting to behavior appropriate for a Loop different to the one I&#039;m in.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes,&quot; the stallion in the purple mask next to them said. His cutie mark was of a simple bo staff wrapped at both ends. &quot;My brothers and I have somewhat less serious cases of the same problem since our variations tend to have mostly similar histories, but it&#039;s still a problem for us at times. I&#039;ve taken to calling it Disassociative Loop Identity Disorder and I&#039;ve started a paper detailing the condition and the more successful methods of dealing with it. Hopefully if any more like miss &#039;Breaking News&#039; here suffer from it we can help them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Absolutely fascinating,&quot; Twilight mused, missing the dirty look the mare sent to the grinning stallion. &quot;Most loopers I&#039;ve talked to seem to spend the majority of their Loops with a history similar to their baseline self. I never really thought of what it could be like if you kept Waking Up to find that you had led a distinctly different life than the last Loop. Oh, hey Rainbow, glad you could make it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t miss it,&quot; Rainbow returned emphatically. &quot;Had to know what got Pinkie so worked up. Had to see if these guys were half as cool as she made them out to be.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Dudette, we are the coolest you&#039;re ever going to meet,&quot; drawled the one in the orange mask coming up behind her, half a pizza balancing on his back as he munched on a slice and a cutie mark of nunchucks on his flank. He grinned at her in a way she&#039;d normally seen in the mirror. &quot;Why, you could say we&#039;re at least 20% cooler than the competition!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow blinked at having her phrase tossed back at her so casually before returning the grin confidently. &quot;Oh, yeah? You think you can keep up with me <i>dude</i>? I&#039;m Rainbow Dash, fastest flier in Equestria even before I started looping.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Michelangelo&#039;s the name,&quot; the stallion returned with equal confidence, &quot;and extreme&#039;s the game. Fighting, partying, or stunts, I&#039;m the host with the most.&quot;</p><p class="double">The red-masked one, sporting a cutie mark of twin three-pronged daggers, groaned as Fluttershy patted him sympathetically. &quot;Oh Kami,&quot; he muttered in a manner not unlike her friend Gilda. &quot;There&#039;s <i>three</i> of them now...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, mister Splinter,&quot; she heard Rarity say from over in a corner where she and Spike were having tea with the diamond dog, &quot;I must say, rat or dog, you are the most well-mannered and cultured example I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So,&quot; Rainbow said, reminding herself to get the full scoop on the diamond dog from Rarity later, &quot;mind introducing me to the rest of you? And where&#039;s Applejack?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s in the kitchen making apple pizzas after Michelangelo dared her,&quot; Twilight told her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, call me Mikey,&quot; Michelangelo smiled as Pinkie popped up behind him. &quot;All my friends do.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeppers!&quot; Pinkie beamed. &quot;You already met Michelangelo, or Mikey for short here. He&#039;s kinda like both you and me all wrapped up in one amazing package!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow was rather proud of herself for suppressing a wince of sympathy for the others present. She was awesome, Pinkie was awesome (if tiring to deal with sometimes), but somepony who was both at once sounded a little much even to her. On the other hoof, the pranks they could pull this Loop were going to be even more awesome than normal.</p><p class="double">&quot;The grumpy grumpypants over there is Raphael, or Raph,&quot; Pinkie continued, pointing to the stallion in the red mask. &quot;The super smartypants over with Twilight is Donatello, or Donnie. You know, I wonder why your names didn&#039;t change. Most loopers&#039; do when they come here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;They sort of did,&quot; Donnie allowed. &quot;But they were close enough to our usual names that if felt weird calling each other by them, so we just stuck with our normal names.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Except for me,&quot; the mare groused. &quot;I&#039;m called &#039;Breaking News&#039; here, but I&#039;m usually known as April O&#039;Neil.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I replaced her when I looped with them,&quot; Pinkie stage whispered none too quietly.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who&#039;s the Anchor?&quot; Rainbow asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, that would be Splinter-sensei,&quot; Mikey pointed to the diamond dog. &quot;Which is cool, because I don&#039;t think I or my brothers could take being without each other for as many Loops as sensei&#039;s been alone in.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is a burden I gladly bear if it will spare my sons from the loneliness of the Loops,&quot; the diamond dog agreed.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, wasn&#039;t there one more of you?&quot; Rainbow asked, looking around. She nearly jumped to the ceiling when she spotted the blue-masked stallion – cutie mark of crossed Neighpon-style swords on his flank – right next to her examining Tank. She hadn&#039;t even noticed him!</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s Leonardo, or Leo,&quot; Mikey told her. &quot;He does that from time to time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d like to know what he finds so interesting about my pet tortoise...&quot; Rainbow finished fighting down the instinctive urge to jump as high and fast as possible. With the power she&#039;d gained over the Loops, she could have inadvertently given the library a new skylight.</p><p class="double">&quot;My apologies miss Dash,&quot; Leo offered, &quot;but I thought your tortoise looked familiar.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know,&quot; Mikey joined his brother in examining Tank, &quot;I think you&#039;re right.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;When the buck did he move?&#039;</i> Rainbow thought to herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;Holy pepperoni!&quot; Mikey exclaimed suddenly. &quot;It&#039;s Tank! How&#039;ve you been my brother from another universe?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow was wondering how her tortoise was taking this since he seemed content to just stare back at the two and grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait,&quot; Twilight twitched. &quot;Since when is Tank looping?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think he is,&quot; replied Donnie as he, Raph, and even Breaking News joined the gathering around Rainbow&#039;s pet tortoise, &quot;he&#039;s never seemed aware of the Loops, but we&#039;ve had him pop up in variations as our fifth brother about a dozen times now.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight twitched at this extra little bit of Loop weirdness, before sighing and hoofing away the stress.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyway, we need to discuss what we&#039;re going to do about Nightmare Moon. Luna hasn&#039;t signaled that she&#039;s Awake, so she&#039;s either not, she&#039;s planning a prank of her own, or she&#039;s going to Awaken upon defeat of Nightmare Moon, possibly splitting in a way that produces my adopted daughter Nyx.&quot; The latter method didn&#039;t happen often, but it was always a pleasant surprise for Twilight when it did. &quot;If any of the visiting loopers want to get in on this, please let me know.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;The night will last FOREVER!&quot; Nightmare Moon cackled as lightning and thunder danced around her dramatically.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Twilight said, stepping forth confidently, &quot;I suppose there&#039;s only one thing to say to that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And what would that be?&quot; the corrupted alicorn inquired arrogantly. The answer didn&#039;t come from the unicorn in front of her though. It came from directly behind her.</p><p class="double">&quot;COWABUNGA!&quot; multiple voices cried out, and Nightmare Moon whipped around just in time to take a skateboard to the face. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">68.6 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight! Diamond dogs stole all of The Great And Powerful Trixie&#039;s fireworks!&quot; Trixie sobbed as she ran up to Twilight and pulled her into a hug. &quot;Trixie had emptied her pocket so she could sort them, and they took them all and buried them! Trixie has a show tomorrow! What is Trixie to do!?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight thought for a moment, then slowly grinned. &quot;Trixie, get the others, I have a lot of orange flags to make. You just made this a game night loop. It&#039;s time to sweep some mines!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie emitted a noise not unlike a squee. &quot;Twilight knows just how to cheer Trixie up!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Applejack looked up from the box of Apples to Apples Twilight had shown her for this game night loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;... I don&#039;t get it.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled as she hopped to the top of her castle, pulling a bullhorn out of her mane. and turned to face another nearby palace. &quot;My turn Twilight, and I want to trade! Do you... (snerk) Do you have wood, for sheep?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That wasn&#039;t funny the first time Pinkie... knock it off!&quot; came the echoing reply.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">68.7 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know why we had to sit through a lecture about getting a cutie mark. I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is sooo last week. You got yours, I just got mine. We all have them already.&quot; Diamond mock gasped. &quot;I mean, almost all of us have them already. Don&#039;t worry, you two, you&#039;re still totally invited to my cute-ceañera this weekend.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon stared at her friend for a while.</p><p class="double">&quot;...what?&quot; Diamond Tiara looked back. &quot;Why are you looking at me like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">After a moment, the grey filly shrugged. &quot;It&#039;s just... are we really doing this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Doing what?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The whole... cutie shaming thing. Why are we doing this?&quot; She rolled a hoof through the air. &quot;Yeah, Twist and Bloom are kinda pathetic to be the last, but why focus on that? If we&#039;re such amazing ponies, we should, you know, let our amazingness speak for itself instead of trying to tear down others.&quot;</p><p class="double">Diamond Tiara blinked. &quot;Wait... what? What are you talking about?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just... you know what, forget it.&quot; Silver Spoon sighed. &quot;I think I&#039;ll just go home now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Hmph, sure. When you stop being weird, you should drop by my place. We still need to plan the party!&quot;</p><p class="double">The grey filly nodded absently, spreading her dragonfly wings and taking off. An observant pony would have noticed how, halfway through her flight, she changed directions and headed for Sweet Apple Acres.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I mean, it&#039;s her, like I remember her.&quot; Silver balanced on the edge of her glass, sipping through the miniaturized straw. &quot;Except... now I know her in the loops and... I compare them and it&#039;s like, how was she ever that? And was I... was I ever like that?&quot;</p><p class="double">Macintosh rubbed his brow with a hoof. &quot;Tha difference that experience can make in a pony is always surprisin&#039;. Even more so with tha loops.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;She&#039;s my friend-I think. I mean, I hope she is.&quot; With a flick of her wings, Silver was pacing on the bar counter. &quot;But, it&#039;s like.... I was shallow, I know that, and I know she was kinda shallow too, but now I see this and I&#039;m... I don&#039;t even know how to deal with this. I want to stay her friend, but the way she is now-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If Ah may make a suggestion... It might be best ta consider this Diamond Tiara something more like tha looping Diamond&#039;s little sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">Silver Spoon froze. &quot;....I... I guess I could see that....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">68.8 (Vulpine Fury)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight? It&#039;s great you&#039;re a Crusader this loop an&#039; all, but how the hay did you know that Mean Bugs was tryin&#039; ta hornswaggle us?&quot; Applebloom asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s elementary, girls!&quot; Twilight &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; Sparkle beamed. &quot;The scimitar was engraved as being presented to General Stone Wall after the <i>First</i> Battle of Minotaur Run, but the Minotaurs didn&#039;t call the battle that, they called it the Battle of Mane-assas, and they had no idea there&#039;d be a <i>Second</i> Battle there three years later, so why would they call it the <i>First</i> one?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, that&#039;s fascinating and all...&quot; Scootaloo rolled her eyes. &quot;And how did you even know all that when I&#039;m pretty sure this is a fused loop? I mean, not even a bookwom like you can learn that much history that fast!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Cheerilee helped me out. She&#039;s such a great friend!&quot; Twilight&#039;s eyes shot open as she felt the familiar tingle. Warily, she turned to check her flank and found her familiar starbursts. &quot;Oh, Maple.&quot; She grumbled. </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
				<a name='73'></a><h3>Loops 69</h3>
<p>69.1 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Witch-King of Angmar, chief of the Ringwaiths, felt the first stirrings of an inkling of a hint of a possibility of fear.</p><p class="double">Of course he was invincible, immortal, unstoppable save by his dread lord Sauron. He knew it; the armies under him knew it; and his enemies certainly knew it.</p><p class="double">Which made it all the more troubling that he was surrounded by a group of warriors facing him and his foul steed with not even a hint of fear.</p><p class="double">One stepped forward, removing a helmet to reveal brilliant red hair tied in a short ponytail. &quot;Technically not a man, at the moment,&quot; said Ranma Saotome.</p><p class="double">Another removed a helmet to reveal hair more orange than red, bound under a black headband. &quot;Never been a man,&quot; Lina Inverse added, a ball of magic growing in the palm of her hand.</p><p class="double">A figure in wizardly robes pushed back her hat and lifted an elaborate staff. &quot;Also not a man,&quot; said Nanoha.</p><p class="double">A steed of the Rohirrhim trotted forward, shaking its head to throw off the armored bridle from its head. The horn didn&#039;t fall off with the bridle. &quot;Not even human,&quot; said Twilight Sparkle. On her back Link didn&#039;t bother with words; he simply shook his hair, revealing his long pointed ears, as he kept the Master Sword pointed directly at the nazgul.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wouldn&#039;t be afraid of you,&quot; Garrus shouted, &quot;even if I were human!&quot;</p><p class="double">Out of a puff of smoke stepped a lithe figure dressed as one of the Haradrim, except in blue and gray instead of yellow and black. Sheik cracked her knuckles meaningfully.</p><p class="double">And another, and another, and another stepped forward, all unafraid, all ready for battle... not a single one a human male.</p><p class="double">The Witch King of Angmar, unable to retreat by the orders of Sauron, did the only thing he could. He drew his sword, saluted, and charged to the attack.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Half an hour of what could only be called nazgul volleyball tore up the Pellenor Fields more than an entire week of occupation by an orcish army.</p><p class="double">Amazingly, in all the fight the lizard-like flying creature wasn&#039;t harmed. A yellow pony of Rohan led it meekly away from the field of battle, telling the creature, &quot;You&#039;re not really a bad wyvern, are you? You&#039;re very sorry about the trouble you&#039;ve caused, aren&#039;t you? That&#039;s all right, you don&#039;t have to go back to that nasty Mordor place...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">69.2 (Scygnus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke... with tears in her eyes and dust in her nose. After getting around to sneezing, then blasting the embarrassing mucous out of existence (seriously, had she hidden a flan in there?) she looked around... then down. Yup, younger. Not quite so young as to try for a different Cutie Mark again, but still pretty young. She checked her memories, just in case-</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; She rolled her eyes. She remembered this, oddly enough. Some of the other students had bullied her until she cried and ran away. But it was... just a bit different. In the baseline, she&#039;d run into Celestia (literally) and gotten comforted. The Princess hadn&#039;t been in the same place this time though, so Twilight had found herself in a dusty store-room instead.</p><p class="double">&quot;According to the laws of narrative causality, there must be something important in here. Probably the main gag of the variant.&quot; Twilight spoke to herself, lighting her horn and looking around. Dust, boxes, bags, more dust, mirror... no, not that mirror. Not a magical mirror. Hrm. And then her light glinted off of something, buried in the rags. A little digging, and she lifted it out. A dusty old oil lamp. Not Saddle Arabian, surprisingly, just an oil container with a green-tinted glass bulb to hold the wick. She blew it off, sending spiders skittering away. A shiver ran down her spine as she turned it round and round, looking for some clue. She rubbed it. Nothing. The lamp was giving off a creepy vibe, even though it offered up no hints as to its purpose.</p><p class="double">&quot;If I&#039;ve been lead to a perfectly ordinary lamp for no good reason...&quot; Twilight grumbled, looking about. She yanked a small table - barely two hooves across - out of the pile and set it down, then set the lamp on it, so she could stare it down without having to hold it. It was during this stare-down she finally noticed... it still had oil in it. Good oil, if it was still moving that much when she swished it about.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; Twilight repeated, facehoofing. She lit her horn again... and sparked the wick. The lamp lit, burning cheerily, the glass turning the flame an eerie green. Shadows shifted around the room, and she heard the fluttering of bats she was pretty sure weren&#039;t in the room a moment ago, while spiders skittered in the corners. Twilight tensed, the creepy vibe jumping up considerably, readying herself for... absolutely nothing. Just bats and spiders. What was this, a lamp for telling scary stories around? Just atmosphere?</p><p class="double">Then her eyes lit on the bulb again, and she perked. The flame revealed words! Twilight very carefully read them. Individually, backwards, with her horn off. No need to cast some kind of spell accidentally. Still, once she put it all together, she grinned.</p><p class="double">&quot;I really shouldn&#039;t... but I&#039;m going to anyway.&quot; The creepiness, the bats and shadows and spiders, all seemed to become restless at her pronouncement, an unfelt wind beginning to blow the scraps littering the room about. A note of Heartsong began in the back of her hearing. With a sense of anticipation, she began to intone the words on the lamp.</p><p class="double">&quot;Though I know I should be wary,</p><p>Still I venture someplace scary.</p><p>Ghostly haunting I turn loose,</p><p>Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, BEETLEJUICE!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;IT&#039;S SHOWTIME!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">69.3 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double">(Background 13 continued)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight gasped, as she saw several of the stone pillars her friends had escaped across collapse from the hydra&#039;s failed attack. Pinkie was trying to convince her to jump anyway, when the sound of electric guitars filled the swamp, and the ground began shaking as another large creature came thundering towards them.</p><p class="double">It was the size of a building, at least twenty feet tall, a bipedal thing covered in colors. One leg was blue, the other yellow. It had a red body, black arms, and soulless yellow eyes. And it was running up the hill behind the hydra, which had turned to face the new creature.</p><p class="double">As it charged towards the hydra, voices sounded above the guitars.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Go go, Bon-Bon Rangers!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">It slowed to start fighting the hyrda, throwing a punch at one head, while deftly sidestepping another. With the hydra well and truely distracted, Twilight charged her horn to teleport across to the intact pillar, and finish crossing the chasm.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Go go, Bon-Bon Rangers!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">Reaching her friends, she turned back to watch the fight. The creature had one of the hydra&#039;s heads tucked behind its armpit, and was using it to leverage the multiheaded beast off balance, even as it threw punches at the other heads with its remaining arm.</p><p class="double">As the hydra fell to one leg, the other creature shifted its grip to the base of one of the middle necks, reached down to grip the body with the other arm, and made the first sound they had heard from it so far.</p><p class="double">&quot;SUPLEX MAGNIFICO!&quot; And with that, it heaved the hydra over its head, where it flew back down the hill and out of sight. A second later, a colossal explosion lit up the sky, backlighting the strange creature with the fireball.</p><p class="double"><i>&quot;Go go, Bon-Bon Rangers! You mighty morphing Bon-Bon Rangers!&quot;</i></p><p class="double">As the guitars cut out, there was a giant flash of green flame from the creature. As it cleared, in its place was a group of eight ponies in a pony pyramid. They wore brightly colored bodysuits, and full helmets with reflective black visors. And then, in a flash of teleportation, they too were gone.</p><p class="double">The stunned silence that followed was broken, when Twilight turned to her friend. &quot;Pinkie, I&#039;m sorry I ever doubted you. That, was one heck of a doozy.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Power Rangers, eh?&quot; Applejack asked, as she descended back into her loop-form of Raindrops. &quot;Ah can see why you needed the fireball.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yupperoony, Rainy-Jay! You can&#039;t defeat the monster of the week without it exploding. You did great on the special effects, got the timing on the music <i>juuuust</i> right!&quot; Bon Ranger Blue replied.</p><p class="double">&quot;An&#039; where are ya goin&#039; from here? Gonna fill me in on the plan, like you told me you would? For that matter, if&#039;n this was planned, why&#039;d you grab me all sudden-like for this?&quot; AJ addressed the assembled Pinkielings, still in their Bon Ranger forms.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, today was kinda spur of the moment. I just had this idea of Megabon defeating the hydra, and the fireball, and ad-libbed from there.&quot; Bon Green started.</p><p class="double">&quot;I figure it&#039;s a good preview, we start up proper-like next month. Rarity-ette&#039;s on props and costumes, Rosy-Fluttery-Lucky-Shy&#039;s gonna shapeshift into the monster of the week, and Ditzy Dashie&#039;s writing our script!&quot; Bon Yellow continued.</p><p class="double">&quot;And Twilyra&#039;s gonna be helping with the whole giant monster part, so we can pull out Megabon from time to time. Other then that, we just wanna see how long we can keep this up until the Princess comes after us.&quot; Bon Red finished, her body language indicating a smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;About that Megabon, how&#039;s that work? Shift into various parts o&#039; it, Voltron yourself together, and control via hive-mind?&quot; Applejack felt she might regret asking this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not quiet, my Existential Apple! Observe.&quot; Bon Blue replied, before turning into Megabon&#039;s lower left leg. She was quickly followed by Bon Yellow turning into the lower right leg. Both legs had strange spines sticking out of the top.</p><p class="double">&quot;When we planned this, the hive-mind wasn&#039;t fast enough, couldn&#039;t co-ordinate well enough.&quot; Bon White told her, as she jumped to form the pelvis and upper legs.</p><p class="double">*Snap-crik!*</p><p class="double">&quot;So in the end, we figured out how to do direct neural linking, via precisely properly performed shifting.&quot; Bon Red said as she formed most of the torso.</p><p class="double">*Criiik*</p><p class="double">&quot;And it works really well too, <i>way</i> better then just the hive-mind!&quot; Bon Black added, as she leapt to form the chest and shoulders.</p><p class="double">*Squelch*</p><p class="double">&quot;And thanks to that, we can control the Megabon as if we had a single body, right from the start!&quot; Bon Purple said, as she and Bon Green formed the arms.</p><p class="double">*Chk-crik*</p><p class="double">&quot;And I form the head!&quot; Bon Pink said from the shoulder, her form shifting into the Megabon&#039;s head. Walking to its place on entirely too many little legs, the head locked in place with a *crack-clack!* sound.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, whadda ya think?&quot; Pinkie asked, now of a single body.</p><p class="double">Having now seen the Megabon for the horrific mass of colored chitin and compartmentalized biology it was, Applejack felt the proper response was to vomit.</p><p class="double">“That... isn&#039;t how shapeshifting is supposed to be used...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was enjoying her vacation as Lyra Sparkle. As she sat in the park, calmly playing her lyre, she reflected that she should try being a musician more often. Her reflection, and playing, were interrupted by a thump, and a familiar mare trying to glare at her from a nearby tree.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, your social engineering project backfired.&quot; Rainbow Dew finally got both her eyes levelled at Twilight. &quot;Spectacularly.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Again? On Hearts and Hooves Day? Did my baseline self get stood up?&quot; Packing her lyre away, Twilight began pondering on how badly things must&#039;ve gone, that she needed to console her unAwake self.</p><p class="double">While the whole dating thing hadn&#039;t been going well, nopony could really fault Twilight for trying. Many were thankful Princess Celestia had talked some reason into her on the subject, especially after the carnage Twilight&#039;s &quot;perfect date night&quot; had inflicted on the Gala.</p><p class="double">It goes without saying, however, that while they didn&#039;t fault the unAwake one, the Awake Twilight accepts full blame for the... incidents.</p><p class="double">&quot;Worse. You know how there are those events that happen, unless the ponies involved are Awake to prevent them? The Ursa Minor, unAwake Twilight&#039;s time travel, and so on? And how the Crusader&#039;s doing the love poison thing is on that list?&quot; While attempting to cross her hooves to look even more stern, Rainbow&#039;s in-loop luck kicked in, or rather kicked her, and she fell out of the tree.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, how could I ever forget that time they set Cheerilee up with Sombra? Oh. Oh cypress, we&#039;re in trouble aren&#039;t we?&quot; Twilight got a sinking feeling, considering the prospects of her baseline self under the influence of love poison.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep, and unlike Sombra, we can&#039;t just send her to the moon. Unless you wanna explain that to the Princess?&quot; Rainbow had picked herself up off the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;Let&#039;s go see how bad it is, then make up our minds. Maybe we can convince her that it was a hallucination? Play up the fact she was under a mind altering effect?&quot; Twilight felt she had done enough to her other self&#039;s reputation, she didn&#039;t want to add a drug induced rampage to the list.</p><p class="double">&quot;Worth a shot. Come on, I think they&#039;re still at Sugercube Corner.&quot; Opting to walk, Rainbow set off with Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;By the way, I know the eyes bother you, so why aren&#039;t you wearing those glasses I made you?&quot; They left the park, once again trying to save Ponyville from themselves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Scoots said they make me look like a hipster.&quot; There were some lines even Rainbow Dash was reluctant to cross. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">69.4 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The dragon god sat on the mountain ridge and surveyed its domain.

The jaffa had a tendency to Loop as the local variety of alien during fusions, but a pony was... Well, actually, now that she thought of it she wasn&#039;t sure it made top ten.

Once she was satisfied that she was alone with Twilight, she slumped forward. A wave of green fire ran across her body, revealing Chrysalis&#039; true form. &quot;Twilight Sparkle,&quot; she said, &quot;I think I may have a problem.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight raised a hoof to stop Chrysalis. &quot;That&#039;s between you and Trixie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that kind of...&quot; Chrysalis considered the point. &quot;Actually, it is that sort of problem, but not involving me directly.&quot; She pulled a piece of parchment out of her pocket and gave it to Twilight. &quot;One of my drones left this this morning.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight read:</p><p class="double"><i>My Queen;</i></p><p class="double"><i>Hate you.

It was as if a hundred million voices were singing in her head.</p><p class="double">Drunkenly.</p><p class="double">And extremely out of tune.</p><p class="double">As she opened her eyes, she looked into the mirror that was conveniently placed in in front of her muzzle. And saw that her colours were wrong.</p><p class="double">Wrong, not as in &#039;By the Sapling, this is an affront to style&#039; wrong. Wrong, as in &#039;I look like myself done up in Chrysalis&#039; colour-scheme&#039; wrong. And... well, that was an exoskeleton she had. Huh.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, into the room burst a similar bizarro-Chryssy, wigging out at her bubblegum-pink exoskeleton... no, wait, that was fur this time... and tricolored &#039;mane&#039;. &quot;CADENCE!&quot; she squealed. &quot;IDONTKNOWHOWTHIS...&quot;</p><p class="double">Cadence, the current Changeling Queen with a satiated hive placed her hoof gently on the Princess of Love-Hunger&#039;s lips. &quot;We&#039;ve been through worse,&quot; she soothed. &quot;But currently the hive is blitzed.&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis quieted for a bit, then began to giggle.</p><p class="double">Cadence gave her companion a flat look. &quot;I&#039;m still marrying Shiny,&quot; she growled.</p><p class="double">Chryssy just shrugged and giggled some more. &quot;Fair enough.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">69.19 (RedshirtZombie)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Princess!&quot; yelled Shining Armor, as he pushed through Celestia&#039;s bedroom doors.</p><p class="double">Celestia looked over from the hearth, allowing her moment of quiet to end. Nightmare Moon had begun her attack on Equestria. &quot;Yes, Captain?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We have alert of Moon Rock incoming towards Canterlot!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Understood. Have you formed an anti-meteor shield yet?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wha?&quot; Shining stopped, with all the elegance and inertial control of a derailed freight train. &quot;No, not A moon rock-&quot;</p><p class="double">The curtains to Celestia&#039;s balcony swished open. Standing at the middle of that opening was a mare, clad in black faux-leather accented with blue-silver plates, as much armor as costume, and studded with silver spikes. Her face had been painted over, the usual midnight-blue coat covered in a thick lair of moon-white paint scrawled with elaborate sigils and designs appropriate only to one mare&#039;s madness. Her mane had been dyed pitch-black, somehow, with the twinkling of the stars in it only contrasting that much more. Hindhooves clad in metal boots and greaves supported her bipedally, allowing herself to hold - no, wield - her axe guitar within her front legs&#039; grasp, wings spread behind her and equally as decorated as her face.</p><p class="double">Her sister had returned, clad in her full Nightmare Moon guise. To her sides, a cohort of the bat-winged guard her sister preferred stood, ready – their usual centurion armor replaced by similar studded black pleather, but nowhere near as overt as Luna&#039;s. Behind them, amplifiers bigger than either sister stood poised, the air almost cackling with sound.</p><p class="double">Luna raised a hoof. &quot;Moon Rock.&quot; And brought it down.</p><p class="double">And that&#039;s how Luna returned to Equestria. With a dial that went past eleven, to twenty-three. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">69.20 (yannoshka)</p><p class="double">Mrs Twilight Nova was cheerfully humming as she went about making breakfast for her family. Her husband Artemis Moonshield was reading the papers at the dining table, and their daughter was just rushing down the stairs to join them when all three Awoke.</p><p class="double">After a moment of mental readjustment necessary after a fresh awakening, Twilight and Luna gave an almost synchronized, mildly curious &quot;Huh.&quot; and returned to their pre-awakening occupations.</p><p class="double">Nyx however was rather more vociferous owing to the awakening hitting her mid-dash on the final stair.</p><p class="double">&quot;Blessed Baobab! Xylem and Phloem! Pestiferous Poison Ivy! Nettlesome Nettles!&quot; she cussed as she got back up onto her hooves.</p><p class="double">&quot;Language young lady! Everything fine, nothing broken?&quot; Twilight asked her over her shoulder as she finalized toast.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just lots of bruises momma.&quot; The filly responded as she got to the table, and then addressed her &#039;father&#039;.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, you&#039;re my papa this loop Luna? I must say you are reacting much more serenely than I would have in your place, and I am you, for a certain measure of I and you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Artemis folded his papers neatly and smiled at his... well it was complicated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Tis neither the first time, nor, I am certain, the last that I looped as male, nor as being married, nor as having children. Though it always is depressing to have to keep my distance from the in loop family, with all of us awake there is no such problem here. Henceforth tis my belief this will turn out an enjoyable loop. Would you like me to heal your bruises, or would you prefer to do so yourself?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, you might as well start acting paternal. So, momma. Anyone else awake? I know none of the girls are.&quot;</p><p class="double">As Artemis lit up his horn, Twilight levitated the breakfast to the table. She chewed on a piece of honeyed toast and gave her daughter a searching look.</p><p class="double">“I thought you could only do that if the others are asleep?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s half past six on a day without school. Of course they are still asleep. Even Bloom is having a lie in. So?”</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s horn lit up and eyes went distant as she started scrying.</p><p class="double">&quot;None of the elements... Can&#039;t be certain about Discord. Cheerilee... just put up the signal... No others so far.&quot; then her gaze snapped back.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, what&#039;s the plan? I am apparently replacing uncle this loop, and went into MA9 instead of the guard. As far as I can determine from my loop memories, we are the only variation to the baseline. Luna?&quot;</p><p class="double">“I concur.”</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Silver Spoon is a pegasus this loop, too.&quot; Nyx added.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, two viable options spring to my mind.&quot; Artemis mused looking at Nyx. &quot;We can have you girls become elements of harmony...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Tempting but we don&#039;t have enough time.&quot; Nyx interrupted. &quot;Nightmare Moon returns tonight, and it will take more time than that to reform DT. So, what&#039;s the other idea?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We can be a nice, helpful extended family and take Twilight Sparkle in. We can triple team her then.&quot; Artemis&#039; smile was beatific.</p><p class="double">Twilight and Nyx looked at him, and then exchanged long thoughtful look. Urchinlike smiles spread across their faces as all three of them began to cackle in evil delight. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So Momma, Luna, what&#039;s up with your mysterious pasts this loop? My loop memories are kinda confusing on the issue?” Nyx asked her co-conspirators as they ate the breakfast.</p><p class="double">“Oh, that? Apparently We were this loop&#039;s James Bond, just a lot less sleazy.”</p><p class="double">Nyx straightened up from her food, and gave them much more interested look.</p><p class="double">“Really?”</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. The comparison is quite literal, since it inspired mom to write &#039;Mane Blond” a series very loosely based upon our exploits.”</p><p class="double">“Ok, now I really want details! Come on – spill!” Nyx was almost bouncing in her seat out of glee.</p><p class="double">Twilight gave her an indulgent smile and then looked at Artemis. The stallionfied princess just gave her a gracious nod, indicating he left the explanation to her.</p><p class="double">“So... Apparently I was recruited into MA9 straight out of Celestia&#039;s school for gifted unicorns. Now in most loops MA9 is nothing more than ninth division of royal guard battlemages. This loop however, it is the codename for Equestrian secret service. You know espionage, sabotage, counterinteligence, and plainsaddle security – that sort of thing. So I went through a few more years of specialized training, showed high aptitude for both field and desk work and then got sent into field for first hoof expirience. &#039;Artemis&#039; here was one of the rising stars and since our special talents complimented so well, we were soon partnered...”</p><p class="double">“Wait, wait, wait – what are your special talents supposed to be?”</p><p class="double">This time it was Artemis who answered.</p><p class="double">“Sneaky magic and a bit of shielding for me. Nova here is supposed to live up to her name and cause big, highly disruptive and distracting explosions.” He said smugly and winked at Nyx.</p><p class="double">“That is highly precise, tight-control pyrotechnic spells to you, Mr sneakypants.” Twilight bantered back with a faux affront, eliciting more laughter from Nyx.</p><p class="double">“Anyway, our rise through the ranks was meteoric, and unfortunately so was our notoriety, to the extent that a whole set of wards especially designed for the two of us was devised. At that point they promoted us to the top positions within the agency, and a few years down the line we ran the show with Artemis in charge of MA9, and me being named Captain of the guard. In the meantime we married and once you were on the way, we retired from active work and moved here. Now we do research and analysis from home.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Even though it wasn&#039;t her first time, it always felt sorta odd for Twilight to watch herself land into Ponywille town square. As if there was supposed to be some harbinger of metaphysical revelation or something, but experience had thought her it was no more than her subconsciousness acting out on some wrong assumptions created long, long ago in baseline.</p><p class="double">Contrary to her mother all Nyx was experiencing was glee, excitement and tectonium hard determination to enjoy her agreed upon role to the hilt. Speaking of her role...</p><p class="double">“Momma! Momma! There she is look! She looks awfully like you!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was stopped in her trot as her idle gaze automatically followed the shouting of a young filly to see a family group she could not mistake, even though it had been nigh a decade since she last set her eyes upon her aunt and uncle.</p><p class="double">Her uncle was still the same hearthstoppingly handsome stallion he always was. Tall, taller than her brother, coat so deep, inky blue it might as well have been black, penatrating deep blue eyes and mane that marched the shades of midnight sky, put up in a roguish topknot. The decade of his retirement obviously did nothing to detract from his whipcord taught musculature.</p><p class="double">Beside him, her aunt looked frankly plane. If she had been just a tad shorter, her coat several shades darker, and her mane and tail didn&#039;t lack Twilight Sparkles pink highlights, one could think it was older Twilight herself set back through time by some eldrich means.</p><p class="double">And then, there was the filly. Her cousin she supposed, though darned if she could recall her name. She quite obviously favored her father in appearance. Black coated, her purple mane was pulled back with a turquoise headband that perfectly matched her eyes.</p><p class="double">“Yes Nyxie, so I see.” Her aunt answered with a content smile and nuyled the filly gently, before she raised her gaze to Twilight and her eyes hardened.</p><p class="double">“Well, young lady?” She asked in deceptively pleasant voice.</p><p class="double">Unfortunately for Twilight Sparkle she was too socially inept to recognize obvious signs of imminent danger.</p><p class="double">“Auntie Nova! Uncle Artemis! What are you doing here?” She asked in obvious confusion. That was just the wrong thing to do.</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t you Auntie me! It&#039;s been a years since we last met, and that was at your parents Heartswarming dinner that you didn&#039;t even have decency to get inside and say hello and happy heartswarming. Not a single letter in the meantime. You weren&#039;t even at your brothers investiture to the Captain of the guard and you live in the nettling palace. And when you actually get sent io the town your aunt and uncle live, do you bother to send word ahead? No, not the great and important Twilight Sparkle, she is above such mundane matters. I had to be informed by my contacts in the guard that you were coming. Well, what have you to say for yourself?” The older mare exploded and started taking deliberate, menacing, hard steps towards her niece until they were so near their horns were almost touching.</p><p class="double">Twilight was flabergasted, and quite intimidated. Judging by the painful grip on her rear leg, Spike was just as scared as she was. Her muzzle worked soundlessly like a fishes, as she tried, but couldn&#039;t manage to form an answer.</p><p class="double">Her aunt sniffed and in calmer tone continued.</p><p class="double">“You are just lucky I have heard from your parents, your brother, my old contacts and Celestia herself that you are socially a total incompetent, or I&#039;d have disowned you by now. And now that I see you, I see that even those warnings fell far short of dismal reality.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">While her mother was enjoying herself putting the fear of Auntie scorned into her younger self, Nyx was already proceeding to stage two – winning Spike over. She cheerfully trotted over to where the dragonling was huddled against Twilight Sparkles hind limb and poked him with the tip of her hoof, and when that did not produce any results she prodded him again – hard.</p><p class="double">“Hey!” the baby dragon gave a startled yell.</p><p class="double">“Hi! I&#039;m Nyx! What&#039;s your name?” She asked him with her most devastating innocent cheer.</p><p class="double">“Spykoranuvellitar.” came the cautious answer, as Spike shifted stance as to allow himself to see Nyx, while still keeping a cautious eye on Nova.</p><p class="double">“Oh! You must be Spike, cousin Sparkle&#039;s family. How can you be family when you are obviously not a pony?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Before Spike had a chance to answer, Nova was softly correcting her.</p><p class="double">“That is familiar, not family dear. It means bonded magical companion. Spike here is a dragon – an amethyst broadscale I&#039;d say, though with that ridge he might be bright bulwark.” The difference in both her stance and tone was stark. Gone was the mare from Tartarus to be replaced by a warm, softspoken motherly figure.</p><p class="double">“Hello to you Spike. How are you? Sorry if I frightened you, but your guardian need a good talking to. Now, if we hurry along I baked you a citrine pie. And speaking of pies...” The older mare took her eyes from the youngsters and looked around, finally sighting whomever she was looking for.</p><p class="double">“Ah, Pinkamena, I thought I sighted you. You are just the pony I need. Come over here dear, I have someone to introduce you to, and a favor to ask you.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s Pinkie Mrs. T. And you know I&#039;m always up for meeting new friends.”</p><p class="double">“But Pinkamena is such a lovely name. Anyway, Pink.. ie this is my niece Twilight Sparkle, and her assistant Spike. Sparkle, this is Pinkamena Diane Pie, the friendliest Pony in the history of Equestria. Pink...ie dear, I know you are just itching to throw them a welcoming party, but if you&#039;d be so obliging as to come on over to our place in, oh call it half an hour, I&#039;d be ever so grateful if you would guide Sparkle around while she does her chores for princess Celestia.” </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">69.21(Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke looking at a familiar book. <i>Hmmm. Seems like this will be a baseline-</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What?! Who&#039;s there?!&quot; Her gaze shot around frantically and completely out of her control.</p><p class="double"><i>Wait what?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Come out! I can hear you!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. &quot;Wait, if this is-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;AAAAAAAAAA!&quot; Twilight screamed, looking at her own mouth in terror. &quot;What in Tartarus-?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>CALM DOWN.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What the hay are you?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Hung over.</i></p><p class="double">That nonsequiter managed to stop the panicking. &quot;Wait, what?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Okay, not really, but... look, apparently you&#039;re the only one that can hear me, and since I don&#039;t have my loop memories yet I&#039;m just going to assume we glitched into separate personalities without separate bodies.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Hold on...&quot; Twilight stared nervously around the field. &quot;Are... are you in my head?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>...technically yes. The long and short of it is I&#039;m you from the future and-</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, I know this one! You&#039;ve come to change the past because of an epic pony war, right?&quot; Twilight broke out in a grin. &quot;Ah-ha! I knew this Mare in the Moon business was legitimate! Don&#039;t worry, future mind me, working together I know we can-&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>She&#039;s our daughter actually.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;-save therashlbla?&quot; Twilight stared back at the book. &quot;But, but, but, but, but....&quot;</p><p class="double">Inside her head, Twilight (who mentally labeled herself Vespertine) rolled her metaphorical eyes. <i>Also, there&#039;s no war. Well, there shouldn&#039;t be. Why don&#039;t we walk home calmly and I can tell you all about it.</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>...so that&#039;s what&#039;s happening.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;A time loop? I suppose-&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>By the way, talking to yourself makes you look relatively insane.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;But I&#039;m not! I&#039;m talking to you... even if you are me, except you&#039;re not, I mean-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, who are you talking to?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle turned to her dragon companion. &quot;I&#039;m talking to a version of me in my head that&#039;s stuck in a time loop,&quot; she explained with a smile.</p><p class="double">Spike stared at her for a few seconds. Then, slowly, he began to back away. &quot;O...kay then. I&#039;ll just go... dust some books.&quot; He put down the gift he&#039;d been holding and abruptly scuttled off.</p><p class="double">&quot;....that was weird.&quot;</p><p class="double">Vespertine sighed. <i>Do you even listen to yourself sometimes?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What? What did I...?&quot; Twilight&#039;s eyes went wide. &quot;Oh no. SPIKE! I&#039;M TELLING THE TRUTH, I&#039;M NOT CRAZY!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;THAT&#039;S WHAT THEY ALL SAY!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NO WAIT, I CAN PROVE IT!&quot; She paused to look at a reflective window pane. &quot;I can prove it, right?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Oh, I know where this is going. Normally I wouldn&#039;t spoil things for you, but I guess this once I can help you out... have Spike take a letter about the mare in the moon, but don&#039;t mention me to Celestia!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Okay, sure.&quot; Twilight galloped up. &quot;Spike, I need you to write a letter to the princess.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is it about the voice in your head? Cause I&#039;m already on that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No! This is about the Mare in the Moon! There&#039;s a prophecy! I need to tell Celestia and-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight.&quot; Spike gave her a look. &quot;Maybe you should sit down and have some calming tea.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But-&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Just start dictating,</i> Vespertine groaned, <i>better to get this over with quickly.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Ahem. &#039;My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike raised an eyebrow, but began writing anyway. &quot;Hold on. Preci... preci...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Threshold.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Threh...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh, brink?&quot; Twilight rolled her eyes. &quot;Ugh, that something really bad is about to happen!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I remember this,</i> Vespertine quipped with a giggle. <i>Man... Sorry, go on.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight took a moment to glare at her reflection. &quot;&#039;For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she&#039;s about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.&#039; Send it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...fine.&quot; Spike enscorcelled the scroll with his fire. &quot;I don&#039;t think she&#039;s going to believe you though.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>That&#039;s not the point of this exercise. The point is proving I know how she&#039;s going to reply.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait what? Oh! Right, right.&quot; Twilight nodded. &quot;When the reply comes, don&#039;t read it. Vespertine&#039;s going to tell me what it says.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Vespertine?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Future me! We agreed that caalling both of us Twilight would just be confusing.&quot;</p><p class="double">The dragon crossed his arms. &quot;Glad you&#039;re being logical about talking with a voice in your-&quot; He gagged suddenly, letting out a bout of flame that curled into a rolled-up piece of parchment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Right, time for a test! Vespertine?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Ahem, repeat after me: My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely...</i></p><p class="double">&quot;My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely...&quot; Twilight repeated with a grin.</p><p class="double"><i>...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books! Wait, what?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike rolled his eyes, openning the letter. Said eyes widened after a moment. &quot;Wow. Word for word.... keep going.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hold on, this doesn&#039;t make sense! Why would she say that?&quot; Twilight began to pace around the room. &quot;I mean, study is an important part of-&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Twilight? There&#039;s more.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh.&quot; The unicorn chuckled sheepishly. &quot;Right. I should hear the whole thing, right?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Right, and we should continue the test.</i></p><p class="double">And so it went. Twilight repeated what Vespertine said in her head, and Spike continued to confirm the words in growing awe. By the time the letter was finished, he was a believer... but Twilight was a nervous wreck.</p><p class="double">&quot;How could she... I mean, mare in the moon, dusty old books?! I don&#039;t understand, this doesn&#039;t make sense!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike shrugged. &quot;Hey, maybe Vespertine knows.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...You&#039;re right! Vespertine, do you have any idea what&#039;s going on?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Yes. Yes I do.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight was silent for a moment. Then she frowned. &quot;Well?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>See, here&#039;s the thing: I really really really don&#039;t want to spoil the surprise.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Trust me, you&#039;ll love it!</i></p><p class="double">Twilight groaned, standing up and screaming at the window. &quot;AAAAAAAARGH! STUPID CRYPTIC FUTURE MIND ME!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike coughed. &quot;So.... um, does that mean she knows something?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...I&#039;m going to go get some ice cream. You want some ice cream?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">... &quot;So, Vespertine,&quot; Twilight grumbled, making sure she was alone. &quot;How am I supposed to handle these tickets?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>You know how you were upset with me about the Elements?

<p>70.1</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...the night will last forever!” Nightmare Moon boomed, shaking the ground.</p><p class="double">“Luna...” Twilight said, inflecting her voice to make it carry above the general panic. “Here.”</p><p class="double">She threw a chocolate bar at the dark alicorn.</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon caught it, tore open the wrapping and ate it in a second. “Insignificant! This alone does not make up for a thousand years of missed tributes!”</p><p class="double">“Well, don&#039;t just stand there,” Twilight added, looking at the startled ponies of Ponyville. “She wants tribute, now give it to her!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie grinned, and bounced into Sugarcube Corner. A torrent of sweets and chocolate began to pour from the upstairs window, making Nightmare Moon canter over and start stuffing her face.</p><p class="double">After about a minute, there was an aprupt flash of light, and Luna stood there.</p><p class="double">“Better?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">“Better.” Luna nodded, and took wing.</p><p class="double">“What the what?” Dash managed.</p><p class="double">Twilight shrugged. “You&#039;re not you when you&#039;re... peckish.”</p><p class="double">“Why did you pause?”</p><p class="double">“Copyright issues.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.2</p><p class="double">“Hello, dear,” Pearl called outside the Carousel Boutique. “Surprise!”</p><p class="double">Several seconds passed, during which Sweetie moaned quietly about being left with her sister while her parents went off on holiday.</p><p class="double">Then the door creaked open, and a bleary dragon looked out with sleep in his eyes and what was recognizably one of Rarity&#039;s dressing gowns wrapped imperfectly around his body.</p><p class="double">“Who is it? Sorry, we had a late night...”</p><p class="double">Magnum blinked. “Who the chaos are you?”</p><p class="double">The dragon turned to look at him, though the slightly slit eyes didn&#039;t focus for at least another two seconds. “Spykoranuvellitar. You?”</p><p class="double">“Who is it, dear?” Rarity&#039;s voice came from inside the building. She peered around him out the door, blinked, then jumped a yard into the air.</p><p class="double">“Gah! Mom! Dad! Sorry about this-”</p><p class="double">She vanished back inside, then her magic wrapped around <i>Spykoranuvellitar</i> and pulled him in with a yelp.</p><p class="double">Sweetie had stopped grumbling, and joined her parents in staring as several loud <i>thuds</i> came drifting though the open door.</p><p class="double">Then Rarity zipped back to the door. Her hair was washed and combed, she was wearing something nice, and there was a hint of perfume in the air.</p><p class="double">“Sorry, mother, father,” she began. “I wasn&#039;t expecting you-”</p><p class="double">“Who was <i>that?</i>” Magnum demanded, pointing past her. “That Spyko... whatever character?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right.” Rarity cocked her head slightly, letting a shining band of bluish light flash into clarity at the base of her horn. “That&#039;s my husband.”</p><p class="double">Three unicorn jaws dropped.</p><p class="double">“Your... <i>what?</i>” Pearl repeated.</p><p class="double">“You got <i>married?</i>” Sweetie repeated.</p><p class="double">Magnum seemed completely lost for words.</p><p class="double">Then the dragon poked his own head around the door. “Sorry, Rares,” he said contritely. “Should have remembered this is your place. Oh, are these your parents?”</p><p class="double">“They are.” Rarity stepped back, opening the door more fully – and allowing the light to shine on a near-matching band on the fourth claw of the dragon. “Mom, Dad, Sweetie... this is Spike. Spike, these are my parents and my little sister.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m still trying to wrap my head around <i>husband</i>,” Pearl said forlornly. “When did this happen?”</p><p class="double">“Last month.” As Rarity spoke, Spike moved to stand proudly next to her. “We eloped.”</p><p class="double">“Where to?” Magnum asked, trying to make sense of the situation.</p><p class="double">“Well, right here. I have my own place, so it was sort of pre-eloped.” Rarity shrugged.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s a bit irresponsible, isn&#039;t it?” Pearl asked severely. “You didn&#039;t even let us know!”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re right, and I <i>am</i> sorry,” Rarity admitted. “We were all rather caught up in the moment.” Spike squeezed her shoulder, and she shared a long look with him before turning back to her parents. “Sorry, where are my manners. Come in, come in. Will you be staying long?”</p><p class="double">“Er...” Pearl blushed. “About that...”</p><p class="double">“Am I still staying here for the next month?” Sweetie asked, curiously. “Is mister Spike in the spare room?”</p><p class="double">“No, I have the same room as Rarity,” Spike clarified. “Nice to meet you, Sweetie Belle. Rarity&#039;s told me a lot about you.”</p><p class="double">“She has?” Sweetie looked dubious.</p><p class="double">“Yes. She said you have a lovely singing voice, and I like the sound of your cooking.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn filly thought that over for a few seconds. “&#039;kay.”</p><p class="double">“I assume that I am to look after Sweetie for the foreseeable future?” Rarity asked her parents, receiving two embarrassed nods. “I could make a point here about pots and kettles, but I won&#039;t...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.3</p><p class="double">“Right.” Gilda paced in a circle, her tail trailing on the floor and leaving a black line. “Twenty feet in diameter.”</p><p class="double">Her prospective opponent inspected the circle, then nodded.</p><p class="double">“We start six feet apart, with a three count.” As she spoke, she padded softly over to her starting position, and crouched down. “Three. Two. One. Go!”</p><p class="double">There was a clash, and a flicker of orange.</p><p class="double">“Not bad, bunny,” Gilda grinned. “Care to try seriously this time?”</p><p class="double">Angel nodded absently, then launched himself forward with a carrot in each paw.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Okay, that&#039;s pretty impressive,” Gilda admitted, panting. Her snow-white fur and feathers were speckled with blood as much as red tattoos, and the sparkling Thunder Edge on her back had left scorch marks all over the miniature arena.</p><p class="double">The bits of it which weren&#039;t covered with hundreds upon hundreds of carrots, anyway.</p><p class="double">“Seriously, where do they keep coming from?”</p><p class="double">Angel shrugged. His ears drooped, a sign of fatigue, but nothing else about his easy stance suggested he was particularly tired.</p><p class="double">“Right.” Gilda set her wings, and exhaled sharply. Her tail described a lazy circle in the air.</p><p class="double">The carrot in Angel&#039;s paws expanded suddenly, until it was four times larger than he was.</p><p class="double">Then he shifted his grip, and raised it before giving it a swing.</p><p class="double">Gilda gaped. “Okay, that backfired! Gah!”</p><p class="double">Thunder Edge flashed out.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so,” Trixie asked, when Gilda stopped. “Who won?”</p><p class="double">Gilda shrugged. “Doesn&#039;t matter, does it? It was a good fight.”</p><p class="double">Trixie gave her a look. “He kicked your flank, didn&#039;t he?”</p><p class="double">The griffon slammed her foreclaws on the table. “Is his pocket <i>entirely</i> full of reinforced carrots?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.4</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s not the real Princess Cadence!” Twilight shouted, cutting across the wedding ceremony. “This is!”</p><p class="double">Every pony in the room looked to the figure of Princess Cadence standing next to Twilight, and then turned back to the Princess Cadence standing at the altar.</p><p class="double">Most of them missed the significance of a simultaneous eye-twitch and blink from Princess Celestia, Princess Cadence (the one not on stage), Shining Armor and Twilight.</p><p class="double">“...well, this rather puts a... <i>hitch,</i> into my plans,” the Cadence on stage said. “Nevertheless, I shall prevail!”</p><p class="double">“Wait a second,” the other Cadence muttered to Twilight. “I think something&#039;s a bit-”</p><p class="double">With a sparkling cloud of star-light, the Cadence on stage turned into Nightmare Moon. “You truly have forgotten me, sister,” Nightmare Moon pronounced, as ponies reacted with shock. “To think that thou couldst not tell me from thy niece, even for these many days of preparation.”</p><p class="double">Princess Celestia shook her head wryly. “Actually, we knew all along. Well, I must admit I did not notice at first, but my co-ruler alerted me to the swap within the hour.”</p><p class="double">“Indeed,” Princess Chrysalis said calmly, trotting into the cathedron. Her drone guards flittered in efficiently behind her, moving to evacuate the civilians. “And you&#039;ve given us a <i>delicious</i> opportunity to ambush you, you know.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor, for his part, recovered from the shock quite quickly. He briskly moved away from the revealed Nightmare, and began casting shields.</p><p class="double">“You know, there&#039;s a statue of Sombra in the grounds,” Twilight whispered to her old foalsitter. “I dread to think what the Empire&#039;s going to be like.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m still wrapping my head around Chrysalis as a Princess,” Cadence replied. “Why hasn&#039;t Nightmare Moon attacked yet?”</p><p class="double">“Well, from what I know from raising somepony an awful lot like her, when she&#039;s like this she prefers-”</p><p class="double">At the moment the last spectator was hustled through the door, Nightmare Moon struck. Celestia countered the first bolts of magic by flashing as bright as her sun, and then things got loud.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight said, matter-of-factly. “That&#039;s sorted that out. I love the Elements of Harmony.”</p><p class="double">The other bearers looked askance at her.</p><p class="double">“What?” she asked, defensively. “Look, they&#039;ve solved at least three problems so far. So, does this mean Princess Luna gets reinstated?”</p><p class="double">“What.” Princess Chrysalis&#039; jaw dropped. “She just levelled most of Canterlot! My hive is open to the sky!”</p><p class="double">“Not like they&#039;re complaining,” Twilight replied, nodding over to where some of the drones were setting up sunbathing chairs amidst the rubble that used to be Canterlot Castle. “Besides, I seem to recall a certain other attacker who got forgiven about two or three years ago...”</p><p class="double">Princess Cadence put her hoof over her mouth to hold in a snigger.</p><p class="double">“That sounds most fair,” Princess Celestia allowed, giving her slumbering sister a once-over. “I hope that my dear sibling is as cured as my loyal co-ruler is.”</p><p class="double">“Wait, is this policy now?” Chrysalis demanded. “Because I would <i>not</i> have wanted to have Prince Sombra on the staff.”</p><p class="double">“Well, if he&#039;d been cured instead of turned back into a statue, I don&#039;t see how I could have refused,” Celestia said calmly. “Tell me, Twilight, do any of your friends have plans to become evil and then be cured? I believe that we may need to add another wing to the royal quarters when they are rebuilt, if so.”</p><p class="double">“I <i>was</i> considering accepting a position if there are any open,” Twilight admitted.</p><p class="double">There was a knock on the door. Since the doorframe wasn&#039;t attached to a wall anymore, it was sort of superfluous.</p><p class="double">“Come in,” Princess Cadence answered for them.</p><p class="double">“Hello, dear,” Shining Armor said, pushing the door open and walking through. As he finished getting through, it let out a wheeze and collapsed into the general rubble pile. “I think we managed to chase off the last of the Canis Minor. Did the cathedron survive?”</p><p class="double">“B-b-b-b...” Chrysalis started to stutter, pointing wildly.</p><p class="double">“It did,” Cadence confirmed, then gave her fiancé a stern look. “But I&#039;m not sure if we should go through with it now, Shiny. I mean, you couldn&#039;t tell me from an evil moon villain!”</p><p class="double">“I wasn&#039;t myself?” Shining volunteered.</p><p class="double">“Fine, then.” Cadence nodded. “Same time tomorrow, then? That should give time to move your parents back from their evacuation area.”</p><p class="double">“<i>Why is he suddenly an alicorn?”</i> the Changeling Princess burst out.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;ve heard there&#039;s been a case of it going around lately,” Celestia said delicately. “Well, it&#039;s good to know that I won&#039;t need to dedicate a royal suite to you separately, Prince Shining Armor. Welcome to the team.”</p><p class="double">Chrysalis transferred her disbelieving gape from Shining to Celestia.</p><p class="double">“Right, now, let&#039;s see. That&#039;s one royal suite for me, one for Chrysalis, one for Luna, one for the happy couple, I&#039;ll mark Twilight down as provisional and we can build two in spare as well... Twilight, make a note.”</p><p class="double">Twilight made a note, hiding a snicker.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right, let&#039;s see...”</p><p class="double">Twilight scanned the list of books in the library, for anything new from the loop. It sometimes happened that worlds with unusual events pre-Awakening had entirely new books to read, and that was always nice.</p><p class="double"><i>Ooh, a three-volume work on the integration of Princess Chrysalis and the Canterlot Hive into the government and society. I think I&#039;m going to copy that one...</p><p class="double"></i>Actually, checking her loop-memories, she&#039;d been interviewed for this one. On the moment when the Elements of Harmony had been unleashed on Chrysalis, and had for whatever reason <i>not</i> sent the invader to the moon as they had Luna nearly a thousand years before.</p><p class="double"><i>Well, at least three theories we mentioned in the interview are invalid, unfortunately, but it could still be helpful.</p><p class="double"></i>“Twiiiiii...” her assistant moaned, looking up from a book. “I&#039;m bored.”</p><p class="double">“How can you be bored?” she asked, turning and smiling. “That&#039;s a Daring Do book, isn&#039;t it?”</p><p class="double">“Finished it.” Her assistant tossed her head, sending her rainbow mane flying. “Can&#039;t I go and play with Scootaloo? I read all the books you asked for...”</p><p class="double">“You <i>are</i> a fast reader, I suppose.” Twilight thought for a minute. “Okay, go ahead. But don&#039;t harrass Spykoran too much!”</p><p class="double">“But he&#039;s totally crucial!” Dash complained. “I mean, he&#039;s a <i>dragon</i> who <i>breathes fire on clouds</i> and then makes them shoot <i>thunder </i>and he&#039;s just radical! I want to be like him when I grow up!”</p><p class="double">Twilight chuckled. “I know, I know.” <i>This time, anyway.</i> “But he <i>does</i> have a job, so if he asks you to leave him alone then leave him alone.”</p><p class="double">Dash kicked the table leg in sullen silence.</p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry, I almost forgot.” Twilight picked up a letter from the table. “Can you take this to Princess Celestia? Then you can go and play with Scootaloo.”</p><p class="double">Dash perked up. “Sure thing, big sis!”</p><p class="double">A blur of rainbow light, a <i>boom</i>, and Twilight&#039;s special assistant (and adoptive sister) was halfway to Canterlot by the time the curtains settled back.</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled, wondering just how many photos she should take of chibi-Dash this loop.</p><p class="double">That she&#039;d be taking <i>some</i> was indisputable. This version of Dash was adorable – and potential blackmail or amusement value for her looping self, to boot.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.5</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“My name is Naruto Uzumaki. I dislike morons, idiots, repetition, morons, repetition, hesitation, deviation and traitorous Teriyaki stalls from the future that don&#039;t exist yet. My dream is for the sons of former Jinchuuriki and the sons of former Hokages to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. With my Shadow Clones I&#039;m almost there, I just need to find a table of brotherhood. And I like confusing people and committing untraceable plagarism.”</p><p class="double">Naruto sat back, enjoying the complete and total confusion of his team.</p><p class="double">While he watched Kakashi trying to work out if he knew his own past, he sent out a quick pulse of generalized combined magic/chakra. If there were any loopers around, they <i>should</i> respond...</p><p class="double">One pulse replied. It wasn&#039;t particularly coherent, which probably meant a newbie – or someone who hadn&#039;t had occasion to practise the alert, anyway.</p><p class="double"><i>Well, guess I am the host for this set. May as well see how they plan to mess with things.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Seven vulnerable points,” Zabuza growled threateningly.</p><p class="double">“Self esteem, spleen, left earlobe, right thigh, larynx, hair style and fashion sense,” Naruto listed off. “Or they are on me, anyway.”</p><p class="double">He shrugged, as the missing-nin&#039;s patter faltered. “Hey, I&#039;m a pre-teen, I&#039;ve got a very fragile worldview.”</p><p class="double">Zabuza almost audibly decided to ignore him as insane.</p><p class="double"><i>Seriously, where is that other looper? He&#039;s taking ages to show up...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Senseiiiii?” Naruto whined. “I&#039;ve got too much chakra for this.”</p><p class="double">Demonstrating, he put his foot on a tree, and pushed some of the furball&#039;s chakra through his foot. The tree promptly fell over.</p><p class="double">“Huh.” Kakashi shrugged. “How about that. Sakura, Sasuke, practise that, while I try to avoid Naruto deforesting the island.”</p><p class="double"><i>He&#039;s surprisingly competent when he&#039;s faced with the kind of problems he expects,</i> Naruto thought. Then shook it off. <i>That&#039;s unfair. Who could have predicted </i>our<i> first three years?</p><p class="double"></i>They were interrupted by the sound of unhurried footsteps.</p><p class="double">A tall, willowy, grey-haired woman in a business suit stepped out from behind a large tree. Kakashi instantly went on alert, because the woman hadn&#039;t appeared to get <i>to</i> the tree beforehand – as though she&#039;d just appeared out of the air.</p><p class="double">“Mister... Noruta?” the woman asked, consulting a clipboard. “I&#039;m looking for a mister Noruta Uzukami.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m Naruto Uzumaki,” Naruto volunteered, realizing what had to be going on. Or some of it, at least.</p><p class="double">The woman inspected her clipboard more closely. Then sighed. “This new intern has terrible handwriting. Anyway, I&#039;m supposed to ask you a few questions? Just a routine survey.”</p><p class="double">“Go ahead!” Naruto said brightly.</p><p class="double">“Right.” The woman turned over the first page of her notes on the clipboard. “What is your name?”</p><p class="double">“...Naruto Uzumaki.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, sorry. I swear, these forms...” A pen scratched. “What is your favourite colour?”</p><p class="double">“Orange.”</p><p class="double">“Right... and your mother&#039;s maiden name?”</p><p class="double">“Uhhh...” Naruto turned theatrically to Kakashi. “What was it, sensei?”</p><p class="double">“What of it?”Kakashi said warily. “Who are you?”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m with the Akatsuki corporation,” the woman answered, and patted her suit where there was a cheerful name-tag sticker. <i>Hello, my name is: Ivory.</p><p class="double"></i>“Oh, I remember now!” Naruto beamed, as openly and sincerely as he could (which was very well indeed). “I use my mother&#039;s name. She was an Uzumaki as well!”</p><p class="double">“Ah!” Ivory scribbled something else down. “One more question. Are you now, or have you ever been in the past, a ninja?”</p><p class="double">Naruto indicated his forehead protector.</p><p class="double">“Splendid. Thank you for your time. Please contact us if you have any feedback.” Ivory passed him a card, and walked off.</p><p class="double">“...what just happened?” Kakashi asked, frowning slightly. “I&#039;ve heard of an Akatsuki group before, but not for years...”</p><p class="double">Naruto inspected the card, watching with appreciation as the words on it changed to a simple name and address.</p><p class="double">It was what had been on it before, though, which made him sure he&#039;d found the other looper.</p><p class="double"><i>Ivory Scroll/Mayor Mare</p><p class="double">Usually a pony</p><p class="double">Head of Akatsuki Paperwork division</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“So, first time here?” Naruto asked Ivory a few weeks later.</p><p class="double">Both of them were here by proxy – Ivory using one of her new paper clones, and Naruto one of his more versatile Doppelgangers – so there weren&#039;t any concerns about acting in-character.</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s right,” Ivory agreed. “I&#039;m the right hand woman of the head of this Akatsuki organization, which as I understand it seems to be doing something as stupid as using a very large hammer to stop a clock showing the wrong time.”</p><p class="double">“Pretty much.” Naruto slouched in the chair, waiting for the ramen to arrive. “Most of what I do tends to be related to stopping Akatsuki. You&#039;re from Equestria, then?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed. It&#039;s nice to know you have some familiarity with the baseline I&#039;m working from in terms of understanding.”</p><p class="double">“Well, a bit.” Naruto allowed. “They&#039;re very helpful there. Kakashi was in a bad way.”</p><p class="double">“I have heard of that loop, yes. Twilight brought it up as one way Equestria&#039;s self-assigned status as a sanctuary loop helps other loopers in tangible ways.” Ivory gave a small smile. “But I assume that we&#039;re not here to talk about <i>my</i> loop.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, true.” The local Anchor thought for a while. “Right. I guess you&#039;re <i>anti</i> widespread devastation?”</p><p class="double">Ivory nodded.</p><p class="double">“Right. Always good to check. How good is your grip on Konan&#039;s paper-jutsu?”</p><p class="double">“I can manage reasonably well, I think.” Ivory thought, then nodded. “I can do most of what my loop-memories say I should be able to.”</p><p class="double">“Cool. Okay, here&#039;s the plan...”<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Right.” Anko Mitarashi handed the forms around. “Sign these, return them, and you get one of the scrolls. If you don&#039;t sign them, you fail. If you sign them and die in the forest of death, not only do you fail but your next of kin get absolutely <i>no</i> compensation whatsoever. And if you sign them, and merely get crippled for life, then you get a very small basket of fruit and a card saying <i>at least you didn&#039;t die!</i> And you fail. So, who&#039;s going to wimp out?”</p><p class="double">Several teams looked nervous. One team of genin from Grass chuckled, their leader signing her scroll without even bothering to read the release form.</p><p class="double">Which exploded.</p><p class="double">Most of the genin turned, stunned, to look at the crater.</p><p class="double">“Oh, what the hell?” Anko turned to the desk. “Who mixed in an exploding tag?”</p><p class="double">“None of us,” one of the people at the desk said, as she processed forms and handed out scrolls – though there weren&#039;t a lot more people handing in signed forms anyway at the moment. “Though there was this clause which said you didn&#039;t plan to attempt to conquer Konoha over the course of the exam, so that might be it.”</p><p class="double">Two Sand genin dropped their forms like they were red-hot, and the Sound team walked out.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“That still makes me feel a little ill,” Ivory muttered.</p><p class="double">“Eh, it&#039;s Old Roachy, he&#039;ll come back.” Naruto waved it off. “And I don&#039;t mean next loop, either.”</p><p class="double">“If you say so.” Ivory shook her head. “Right, I&#039;ve got the material for the next one planned out.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent!” Naruto rubbed his hands together. “Make sure you get a picture of his face.”<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Master Pein.”</p><p class="double">The Leader of Akatsuki turned to his second-in-command, wincing slightly as the machine he was in pulled on its connections to him. “What is it?”</p><p class="double">“I have found a way to acquire the nine-tails container.”</p><p class="double">“Good,” Nagato said simply. “Do so.”</p><p class="double">The grey-haired kunoichi paused. “I&#039;m afraid there is paperwork involved.”</p><p class="double">Nagato surprised himself with a brief laugh. “Which is appropriate for you, I suppose. Very well. What must I do?”</p><p class="double">“Sign here.”</p><p class="double">Yahiko&#039;s body took the pen from her hand, and signed the paper. “Done.”</p><p class="double">“Excellent.” Ivory took the paper back, countersigned it, and slipped it into a folder. “You have now adopted the Kyuubi container, Naruto Uzumaki.”</p><p class="double">Nagato paused. “<i>What</i> did you say?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Can&#039;t we do something about it?” the Hokage asked, sighing.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s completely legal,” Homura replied with a sour expression. “This Nagato individual is an Uzumaki, which makes him the closest known relative who hasn&#039;t washed their hands of him unconditionally, and the appropriate paperwork was all filed here as well. It&#039;d take months to contest it.”</p><p class="double">Danzo just shook his head.</p><p class="double">“Isn&#039;t there <i>anything</i> we can do to mitigate the damage?”</p><p class="double">The others exchanged glances. None of them spoke.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;m still not convinced this is going to work,” Ivory confided.</p><p class="double">Naruto shrugged. “Seriously, I <i>know</i> how my world works. It&#039;ll be fine.”<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Why are we moving to Konoha?” Nagato asked, looking blankly at the papers.</p><p class="double">“Because it&#039;s a better environment to carry out the plan.” Ivory dumped another armload on him. “This covers change of citizenship.”</p><p class="double">“How will we be able to gather the Jinchuuriki in the middle of a hidden village?”</p><p class="double">“Surely we both know that&#039;s not the real objective.” Ivory looked up, at where a paper crane was flapping down towards them. “Ah, here we are.”</p><p class="double">She caught it, and unfolded it. “Yep, there we go.”</p><p class="double">Then, with a flick of her wrist, she shook it out. It unfolded further, and further again, until it was a three foot by one page of dense text.</p><p class="double">“A five-sided non-aggression treaty between the hidden villages. Binding, as well. I just got it from thirty paper clones who spent the last month drafting it.”</p><p class="double">She made a few handseals, then tapped the paper. Over a dozen duplicates formed, folded themselves into paper cranes and flew off.</p><p class="double">“That is not going to work,” Nagato stated bluntly. “The world is pain. Even if they sign it – and they will not – they will simply ignore it when the time comes.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, you <i>say</i> that.” Ivory smiled mysteriously. “That&#039;s why the entire document folds up into a one page piece saying that the ninja village in question will not launch any surprise attacks, in return for a very large cash bounty for signing.”</p><p class="double">“Surprise attacks?”</p><p class="double">“Wars are very surprising when they start.” Ivory nodded. “As are attacks before a war has started. And yes, they&#039;ll <i>try</i> to ignore it...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Four sound ninja crept towards Konoha.</p><p class="double">Their mission, given to them by Orochimaru himself (who&#039;d looked a little singed) was to bring Sasuke Uchiha back to the Sound village. By force, if necessary.</p><p class="double">Kidomaru glanced over at the rest of the team, and made some hand gestures. <i>Three. Two. One-</p><p class="double"></i>Clouds of paper erupted from nowhere.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well...” Kakashi said critically, examining the thoroughly mummified Sound Four. “That&#039;s the most literal definition of <i>restraining order</i> I&#039;ve ever seen.”</p><p class="double">Naruto started laughing.</p><p class="double">“It seems to be thousands upon thousands of copies of the peace treaty,” Sakura added uncertainly. “With the signature of... Orochimaru?”</p><p class="double">Naruto just laughed harder.<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“I&#039;m afraid to say that we&#039;re going to let you go.”</p><p class="double">Tobi stared at Ivory. Well, presumably stared. It was a little hard to tell, what with the mask.</p><p class="double">“But why? Tobi is a good intern!”</p><p class="double">“Your handwriting is atrocious, you were late for work on three separate occasions, you treat the whole business as a joke, and you also plan to hypnotize everyone with the moon.” Ivory shook her head. “We can&#039;t give you a good employment reference either, I&#039;m afraid.”</p><p class="double">Tobi shook his head, then chuckled, darkly. “Well, so much for the charade. You do remember that I am Uchiha Madara, do you not?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, about that.” Ivory shuffled some papers. “We understand there&#039;s an issue of identity theft, as well. Can you prove that you are Uchiha Madara, rather than just some random black-haired Uchiha with a mask?”</p><p class="double">“Um...”<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“So, you said you had a loop outside Equestria?” Twilight asked, over tea, the day before the Summer Sun celebration. (They were ostensibly discussing how she should handle checking in on the preparations – she was just off the chariot – and to be fair that was on the agenda.) “Where was it?”</p><p class="double">“The Elemental Countries. Naruto&#039;s world.” The Mayor nodded absently. “Interesting place, though their villains are a bit nasty. I&#039;m sorry to say I was killed.”</p><p class="double">“Ouch.” Twilight winced. “That always stings. Who by?”</p><p class="double">“Tobi. I understand he&#039;s Obito?” she checked, to which Twilight nodded. “Okay, thanks for confirming that. Anyway, I called him out over his real identity and he stalled for a bit, then teleported behind me and stabbed me.”</p><p class="double">“Ouch again.” Twilight let that hang in the air for a moment. “So, anything else?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, there was actually.” Ivory Scroll, also known as Mayor Mare, pulled a large document from her Pocket. “I prepared this earlier. Can you add a spell to the bottom? Oh, and provide shields around the stage.”</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded. “Certainly. Which spell?”<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“The Night will last forever!”</p><p class="double">Ivory trotted smartly up to the stage. “Nightmare Moon?”</p><p class="double">“Yes?” the alicorn replied, looking down. “Why?”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve been served. Good day.” The mayor held out a scroll.</p><p class="double">“Served? What means this?” Nightmare Moon demanded, taking the scroll in her magic and opening it. “I will make you all my servants, of course, but... what! You demand this of your ruler? <i>&#039;You are ordered to cease, desist and explode your attempts to usurp the rule of this country away from the legitimately crowned ruler, Princess Celestia.&#039;</i>”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon laughed cynically, then read on.<i> “&#039;While the aforementioned Celestia will settle for joint rule, she will not settle for sole control in the hands of her sister who was rightly banished for her attempt to conquer Equestria by force. As such, explosive runes.&#039;”</p><p class="double"></i>The alicorn blinked at the last two words, which had started to glow. “Pardon?”</p><p class="double">A very loud <i>bang</i> rattled the windows around Ponyville square.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I&#039;ll go up there and sort her out later,” Twilight affirmed. “I assume that was just as many explosive tag seals as you could fit onto the paper?”</p><p class="double">“With microdot writing,” the real Mayor confirmed. “I also have a few Restraining Orders and a Cutting Letter in my pocket, and I know an ink supplier in Ponyville who can get me useful seal ink. Can you help me sort out how to perform handseals as a pony, though? That paper clone was pre-made. And it&#039;d be nice to know a more versatile trigger, as well.”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” the anchor promised. “I must say, it&#039;s impressive that you&#039;ve managed to fully weaponize paperwork.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.6</p><p class="double">Trixie Lulamoon whistled to herself as she trotted briskly along the road between Trottingham and Manehattan.</p><p class="double">She had a gig in Manehattan next week – they&#039;d booked a stadium – but she could make her own way there, and there was enough slack in the schedule that she could easily manage playing a few minor towns along the way. For old times&#039; sake.</p><p class="double">The kind of place she&#039;d perform in the main street, stay in the house of someone with a room to spare, and set off next morning with a full belly and a spring in her step.</p><p class="double">Then something hurtled out of the sky and landed with a <i>thud</i> just off the road ahead.</p><p class="double">Trixie stopped. Then pulled her wagon over to the side of the road, hit the quick-release catch, and cantered to where the object had landed.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The object, as it turned out, was a pony. An earth pony mare with a dark green coat and a brown mane, who looked a little dazed.</p><p class="double">“Are you alright?” Trixie asked, casting a telekinetic spell which reduced the apparent gravity on the stricken pony. It was more polite than just bodily picking her up...</p><p class="double">“I... yes, I&#039;m okay.” The mare pushed herself unsteadily to her feet, then winced. “Ow, I think that one&#039;s broken.”</p><p class="double">Trixie looked at the leg, and noticed something slightly odd about the joint. Not just the break – which was one of the two bones in the lower foreleg, and as such was technically possible to stand on in low gravity – but the way it was bending.</p><p class="double">She ran back over the situation, and came up with an answer.</p><p class="double">“Are you Queen Chrysalis?” she asked, deciding to get it out in the open.</p><p class="double">The pony froze for a second, then shook her head. “Whoever she is, no.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re lying, aren&#039;t you.” Trixie smiled. “It&#039;s okay, I can see you&#039;re hurt. This should help.”</p><p class="double">She concentrated carefully on her feelings for Chryssy – the older, wiser, Looping version of this disguised Changeling – and put her not inconsiderable magic behind them, then pushed.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis felt a warm, soothing love suffuse her. It restored her drained magic reserves, then died back to a distant but still present heat.</p><p class="double">“...what?”</p><p class="double">“Okay, this is going to sound crazy. But you&#039;re an empath, you can tell that even if this isn&#039;t the truth I believe it. I kind of come from the future, and we&#039;re dating. Specifically...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...so, that&#039;s about the shape of it,” Trixie finished, some time later.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis looked at her, tasting her opinions. “You&#039;re right, you do believe it. Every word.”</p><p class="double">“And...” Trixie prompted.</p><p class="double">“And so do I, curse it.” The no-longer-disguised Changeling kicked the ground. “You&#039;re far too calm to have not met me before, but the Hive has no record of your existence except for the few times a changeling has seen one of your shows. And that love was felt for me, I could tell. But... I don&#039;t reciprocate.”</p><p class="double">“And that&#039;s fine.” Trixie said levelly. “To me, you&#039;re kind of like the younger sister of my mare-friend anyway.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Chrysalis rubbed her forehead. “Okay, what now?”</p><p class="double">Trixie pondered. “Well, I do have a slot open for an assistant...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.7</p><p class="double">“Good morning, Pinchy,” Berry said brightly. “Time for you to get up for school!”</p><p class="double">Ruby Pinch blinked, yawned, and crawled out of bed. “Okay, momma...”</p><p class="double">Berry smiled, moving aside to let her daughter through the bedroom door.</p><p class="double">It was always hard, the first day of a new loop. When her daughter was suddenly years younger, and couldn&#039;t remember a lot of their time together. So she always put on a brave face, because it seemed to help.</p><p class="double">Most of the time.</p><p class="double">“Where&#039;s my cereal, momma?” the filly unicorn (this time, at least) asked. “I can&#039;t find it.”</p><p class="double">“Check on the right side of the cupboard,” Berry replied automatically.</p><p class="double">“Oh, yeah! Thanks, momma!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Some minutes later, Ruby Pinch was at the door. Her teeth were clean, her mane was done, and she had her saddlebags on.</p><p class="double">“Have a good day!” Berry called.</p><p class="double">“Uh... momma?” Ruby said uncertainly, standing just inside the door. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.”</p><p class="double">“Are you okay?”</p><p class="double">Berry blinked. “What do you mean, Pinchy?”</p><p class="double">“Well...” Ruby frowned. “You&#039;re... different, this morning. You seem kind of happier, but sad as well. And you haven&#039;t had a drink yet.”</p><p class="double"><i>Ouch.</p><p class="double"></i>Berry forced a smile, feeling tears start in her eyes. “Oh, Pinchy. I&#039;m sorry if I haven&#039;t been such a good momma, but-”</p><p class="double">“You are!” Ruby said fiercely. “You&#039;re the best!”</p><p class="double">The purple mare had to try a couple of times to resume speaking without croaking.</p><p class="double">“Thank you,” she sniffed, on the third attempt. “Just... thank you, Pinchy.”</p><p class="double">Ruby smiled, not sure how she&#039;d helped, but happy she had.</p><p class="double">“Now, run along, dear. You need to get to school on time.”</p><p class="double">Ruby glanced at the clock, and cantered out into the street to head for school.</p><p class="double">“That says it all, doesn&#039;t it...” Berry muttered to herself. “Buck, I must have been a mess...”</p><p class="double">She shook her head. “Well, I can certainly do better. Especially now. Who knows a good hangover-cure spell...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I see,” Twilight nodded. “You want to make sure you can be sober for Ruby...”</p><p class="double">“...but I don&#039;t want to just give up my passion entirely.” Berry nodded. “That&#039;s right – I can&#039;t just <i>stop</i>, because creating drinks involves tasting. Despite that, I&#039;ve been cutting back a lot gradually over the loops, but this time was when it really came out into the open for me.”</p><p class="double">“Right. Well, Zecora does good cures, of course, but...”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, we don&#039;t always loop together. And asking the non-looping one for over a hundred at a time won&#039;t go down well. To say the least...”</p><p class="double">“Indeed.” Twilight paused. “You do realize that you will need to ascend to gain a horn and the means of casting this spell, correct?”</p><p class="double">“I do,” Berry affirmed. “I may not especially relish my transformation, as such – not that I <i>dis</i>like it, but... oh, you know what I mean. I just prefer to be an earth pony most of the time.”</p><p class="double">The unicorn just gave her a slow nod.</p><p class="double">“But if I have to, I will. Okay, how do I do this...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Berry came muzzily to awareness in her kitchen.</p><p class="double">There was a faint tang of cinnamon in the air.</p><p class="double"><i>Huh. Guess that really </i>did<i> work out stronger than I was anticipating.</i> Berry shook her head, trying to clear the pounding headache that had manifested, and looked at the glass on the table.</p><p class="double">It was, indeed, nearly full of her newly developed &#039;brain suicide by spice&#039;.</p><p class="double">Then she looked at the clock.</p><p class="double"><i>Erk!</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“Come on, come on...” Berry muttered, rummaging through her pocket and wincing against the headache. “Where&#039;s that stupid Spectrum crystal tumbler...”</p><p class="double">Eventually, she managed to locate it, and pulled it out into the real world. A moment&#039;s focus and she was an alicorn, another to cast the spell...</p><p class="double">There was a door-creak.</p><p class="double">And a small pair of lungs inhaling a very impressive amount of air.</p><p class="double"><i>Well, ponyfeathers.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“What, exactly, am I going to put on the stained glass window?” Celestia asked, partly of her sister and partly of thin air. “She appears to have become an <i>alicorn</i> from creating mixed drinks!”</p><p class="double">Luna shrugged, sipping at her glass. “I do not know, dear sister mine. Perhaps some of this coriander cordial will aid your cognition?”</p><p class="double">“...oh, why not.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.8</p><p class="double">“Twilight Sparkle, lend me your ear. I have a plan for you to hear.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up, already aware who it had to be. “Hello, Zecora. I must say, it&#039;s earlier than usual for you to show up in Ponyville of a new loop. Which is saying something... did you have a new pattern for convincing the town that you&#039;re not evil?”</p><p class="double">“My thoughts were such, though why my haste... It is more of the <i>obverse</i> case.” The zebra frowned, scanning back over her words, then let it go. “In truth, I wished to take my chances – what if I really <i>did</i> do evil dances?”</p><p class="double">“...oh, I <i>see!</i>” Twilight nodded. “Right, right. You want to pretend to actually <i>be</i> evil. That should be fine, I can get the rest of the Elements into a team of superheroes fairly easily, even without their looping. Anything I should know?”</p><p class="double">Zecora pondered. “I plan to be equipped with and use trees – an evil witch who rules the Everfree. Counsel Fluttershy I do no <i>true</i> harm...” She shook her head. “I have no wish to so soon buy the farm.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, good point.” Twilight pulled a checklist from her pocket. “Okay, step one for forming the Harmony Elementals – select base. Well, I <i>could</i> do the old elaborate underground base routine...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie fled the <i>stupid</i> town, where there were <i>stupid</i> ponies and <i>stupid</i> bears and <i>stupid, stupid</i>, goody-four-shoes unicorns who showed her up.</p><p class="double">And she&#039;d lost her wagon, as well. Everything she owned.</p><p class="double">After a few minutes, her legs began to ache, and she slowed to a walk. She looked around, noticing that her headlong gallop had carried her into the Everfree Forest.</p><p class="double">Trixie had heard stories about this place, but dismissed them as exaggeration.</p><p class="double"><i>And you should know,</i> part of her whispered. <i>But there certainly was an ursa in there, wasn&#039;t there?</p><p class="double"></i>A twig cracked.</p><p class="double">“Who was that?” she demanded, her horn lighting with a blue glow.</p><p class="double">Something moved past her line of sight, too fast to see. Something else creaked behind her, and she spun – seeing nothing.</p><p class="double">The magic charge in her horn went into a searchlight spell, which showed gnarled tree branches reaching for her. She shivered.</p><p class="double">Somehow, living rough was a lot more pleasant when you had a wagon to do it in...</p><p class="double">Then there was a great crackling, tearing sound off to her right. She looked, and a tree had fallen across the road behind her.</p><p class="double">Another slammed down across the road ahead of her.</p><p class="double">“We should speak soon...” a voice said, in an accent Trixie couldn&#039;t place.</p><p class="double">“...miss Lulamoon.”</p><p class="double">“Who are you?” Trixie demanded, though there was a little catch in her voice.</p><p class="double">Then there was a puff of green smoke, and a striped pony – a <i>zebra</i> – was standing on one of the tree trunks, silhouetted against the sky.</p><p class="double">“You seem upset at Ponyville. I, too, have cause to wish them ill.”</p><p class="double">The zebra gestured, and a network of branches grew from the fallen trunk, providing her with steps to make her way down to Trixie&#039;s level.</p><p class="double">“I have food, drink, a roaring fire... and all the revenge you desire.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You are scarily good at this,” Twilight commented, sipping her herbal tea.</p><p class="double">Thanks to a complex glamour spell, she was currently assuming the role of &#039;Zebediah&#039;,&nbsp;&nbsp;a fellow zebra to Zecora, and as such could visit her without alarming her teammates. (Well, without alarming them too much. She was still relying on a shadow clone back at base, which was obviously rather risky.)</p><p class="double">“I can act much like an evil horse,” Zecora allowed, mixing up a potion which was intended to cause a short-lived Poison Joke effect (about five minutes, making it scary without being threatening). “But my villainy has run its&#039; course. We should plan my return to good – I tire of enforced solitude.”</p><p class="double">“Good idea,” Twilight said. “Was that last one really a rhyme, though? It didn&#039;t scan well...”</p><p class="double">“<i>You</i> try to rhyme with <i>every</i> line,” the zebra muttered, winning a chuckle from Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Okay. Here&#039;s an idea. Use the Joke next time, and then the time after that...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Ponyville shall cower at our knees!” Zecora cackled, marching into town with a half-dozen lumbering wooden golems behind her. “Nothing you can do can defeat the trees!”</p><p class="double">“Not if we can help it!”</p><p class="double">She turned, to see Twilight and her five fellow Element bearers, all in costume. “All six of you at once. I&#039;d thought you were at lunch.”</p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled, then put her serious expression back on.</p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s get her!” Dash shouted.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Several confused minutes later, Zecora was in a small crater with the ruins of five animated trees around it, and a cloud of green smoke dissipating in the breeze.</p><p class="double">The last of the six trees was being enthusiastically nibbled on by Angel Bunny. He was going for the jugular root, whether it existed or not.</p><p class="double">“What now?” Applejack asked, looking dubious and adjusting her Element necklace. “She might&#039;a been evil, but she were bein&#039; controlled, it seems to me, and it wouldn’t be right t&#039; not give her th&#039; same chance Princess Luna got given, and all.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked Zecora in the eye. “Are you still evil, or do you intend any harm to any resident of Ponyville?”</p><p class="double">“I do not. Not a jot.”</p><p class="double">“...sounds good to me!” Pinkie said brightly. Then gave Zecora a stare. “But Pinkie Promise it, just to prove it!”</p><p class="double">Zecora nodded. “Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.”</p><p class="double">The others discussed that amongst themselves.</p><p class="double">“Good enough for me!” Dash pronounced. “Seriously, though, <i>don&#039;t</i> break that promise. Really.”</p><p class="double">“Well, that worked out well!” Twilight said.</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy pointed. “Except for the property damage.”</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the seven or eight destroyed houses. “Community service, I think.”</p><p class="double">Zecora followed their gaze, then wordlessly gestured. New houses – made of wood, of course – erupted from the ground.</p><p class="double">“Thank you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.9</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“And then the light beams are scattered by suspensoids in the atmosphere, which results in a diffusion which has an amplitude proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength, so bluer wavelengths are scattered much more. That results in the blue light being scattered over the sky much more efficiently, with the greater response our eyes have to greener wavelengths and the overall green spectrum peak the sun has resulting in the more characteristic shade compared to deep purple-blue which is the most efficiently scattered.”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee put down the chalk, and turned to the class.</p><p class="double">No-pony spoke for several seconds.</p><p class="double">“I don&#039;t get it...” Snips muttered.</p><p class="double">“Mith?” Twist raised a hoof. “I only asked why the thky is blue...”</p><p class="double">Cheerilee looked back at the equations and diagrams spread over the board. “...whoops. Hang on, I&#039;ll try to put it more simply...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.10</p><p class="double">“We need t&#039; get somepony to fall in love,” Applebloom said, thoughtfully. “That&#039;ll earn us a cutie mark!”</p><p class="double">“Sure,” Scootaloo agreed. “But who?”</p><p class="double">“Well, what about Miss Cheerilee?”</p><p class="double">“She&#039;s out of town today,” Sweetie Belle observed. “Remember? She said she was taking a week&#039;s holiday last Friday.”</p><p class="double">“Well... what about Miss Sparkle, then?” Applebloom suggested. “Wasn&#039;t she gonna be our teacher this week?”</p><p class="double">“Nah,” Scootaloo shook her head. “She doesn&#039;t seem unhappy at all. And Hearts and Hooves day is about making unhappy ponies happy!”</p><p class="double">“Actually...” Sweetie Belle mused. “I have an idea.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A pink haze cleared from Spike&#039;s eyes. He blinked, drawing on his well-practised meditation to speed his thoughts, and began to take stock.</p><p class="double">He was in a hole in the ground.</p><p class="double">He was wearing a suit. Well sized for him, as well, which wasn&#039;t bad given he was about the same size as Big Mac.</p><p class="double">Rarity was also in the hole in the ground, wearing a long white dress.</p><p class="double">And there were three very embarrassed fillies peering over the edge of the hole.</p><p class="double">Rarity exchanged a glance with him, then both of them looked at the edge of the hole.</p><p class="double">“Why am I in a pit wearing a dress?” Rarity asked, focusing specifically on her sister. “There better be a good explanation, because this <i>ruined</i> this dress!”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, Sis,” Sweetie said, blushing. “We thought you needed a special somepony for Hearts and Hooves day!”</p><p class="double">“I have to admit, I like their taste...” Spike murmured, and Rarity gave him a look.</p><p class="double">He waggled his eyebrows slightly.</p><p class="double">Rarity mulled that over, then shrugged. “Oh, whatever.”</p><p class="double">At least they&#039;d have a reasonable excuse, this loop...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Crusaders blinked, as Spike and Rarity embraced.</p><p class="double">“Does this mean it worked?” Scootaloo asked, confused.</p><p class="double">Then all three of them looked away. “Ew, kissing!”</p><p class="double">“Should have thought that thro~ugh!” Rarity called up to them.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.11</p><p class="double">“Hey,” Applejack said, uncertainly. “Gilda? You got a min?”</p><p class="double">“Sure.” The gryphon nodded to her. “Well, only a minute or two right now, I&#039;m gonna do an interview in a few for the &#039;bolts. Spike an&#039; I are havin&#039; a bet over who can be the first non-pony in the group this loop.”</p><p class="double">“Right, right.” Applejack frowned. “Yeah, this might take a while. Come see me when you&#039;ve got the spare time.”</p><p class="double">“Will do.” Gilda gave her a thumbclaw&#039;s up, then returned to scanning the sky for Wonderbolt.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Oi, fruitflank!” Gilda crowed, backwinging to land perching on the branch of a tree.</p><p class="double">“Gilda,” Applejack nodded up to her. “Can y&#039; get off Seedfeld?”</p><p class="double">Gilda glanced down at the branch, which began to creak. “Spoilsport.” Flaring her wings again, she touched down gently on the orchard grass.</p><p class="double">“&#039;preciate it.” Applejack sat back. “Nice outfit, by th&#039; way. You won?”</p><p class="double">“Nah, it was a draw.” Gilda shrugged. “Apparently a fifty foot dragon is as remarkable as a gryphon who doesn&#039;t even care about physics.”</p><p class="double">“There ain&#039;t no accountin&#039; for taste,” Applejack said sympathetically. They nodded together for a moment, then both sniggered.</p><p class="double">“Right,” Applejack began again. “Anyway, what I was gonna say.”</p><p class="double">“Sure.”</p><p class="double">“Well, not t&#039; blow mah own trumpet, but ah&#039;d say that ah have experience with th&#039; element of Honesty.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, that&#039;s fair.” Gilda nodded. “More than I have, anyway. I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s related to that?”</p><p class="double">Applejack tossed her head. “Yep. So, anyway, when I&#039;m usin&#039; my Element, it&#039;s basically like ah can tell when somepony is lying. Ah get a real uncomfortable feel, though o&#039; course it also depends on what kind&#039;a lie. One that ain&#039;t for malice, it&#039;s more like a faint itch... and if ah&#039;m ready for it, that helps too. Like all th&#039; times we set stuff up for fun, that barely registers.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Gilda scratched her chin. “Yeah, mine <i>is</i> different. It&#039;s more like, yours is about people being honest with one another – mine is about people being honest with <i>themselves</i>. It isn&#039;t well developed, yet... hay, I don&#039;t get much practise with you lot... but I kinda get... yeah, feelings is about right. If someone&#039;s not being honest with themselves, I can see vaguely how to get under their skin and screw with them – and get them to admit things to themselves. And I think – I <i>think</i> – that that kind of admission sticks with you.”</p><p class="double">“Sounds useful, actually.” Applejack frowned. “Well, it ain&#039;t pleasant, and all, but it sounds like the kind&#039;a help that people who end up here need sometimes.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah. I should practise it more. I suppose I&#039;m just too used to faking strength to get at real weakness without feeling uncomfortable.” Gilda blinked, and shook her head with a sneeze. “Whoo, that felt strange.

I... don&#039;t know why I expected anything else from you.”</p><p class="double">Rarity smiled briefly. “Well, I <i>am</i> a clothesmaker. What do you think?”</p><p class="double">Trixie swept up the cloak. “It&#039;s basically identical to my normal one... I think?”</p><p class="double">“Ah, that&#039;s where you are both correct and incorrect.” Rarity smiled. “Channel magic into the outer layer.”</p><p class="double">The sorceror did so, resulting in the patterns vanishing. What replaced them was a faintly sparkling starfield, which lit up in tiny patterns of light blue.</p><p class="double">“That looks familiar...” Trixie mused, frowning, then moved it to get a look from another angle. As she did so, it brightened, and green and yellow starbursts added themselves to the pattern. “Wait, I do recognize this!”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded. “It&#039;s your own mane, of course. It reacts to your magic correctly, because I raised the sensitivity.”</p><p class="double">“<i>So</i> cool,” Trixie pronounced, sweeping it onto her back in an explosion of rainbow light. “This is the perfect way to look awesome without having to explain away the wings!”</p><p class="double">“I <i>do</i> try,” Rarity allowed. “Now-”</p><p class="double">“Wait a sec.” Trixie pointed a hoof at her. “Where did this mane of mine come from? Trixie does not recall donating any!”</p><p class="double">Rarity chuckled. “That would be the Changeling Queen, in the bedroom, with the hairbrush. This <i>is</i> – partly –<i> </i>a commission.”</p><p class="double">“...oh, fair enough.” Trixie put her hoof back down again. “What were you saying?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, right. The inner lining?”</p><p class="double">Trixie lifted the tip of the cloak up, revealing a shimmering green lining. “Impressive. But green is not my colour...”</p><p class="double">“Indeed not,” Rarity agreed readily. “But this is a utile measure, and you can always put a second layer beneath it to shield it. That&#039;s some dragonfire from Spike, aimed to a spot in the wilderness. There&#039;s twelve different command phrases for the twelve different portions in there, so you should get several uses out of it before you need a refill.”</p><p class="double">“...so, let Trixie check she has this straight.” The blue unicorn paused. “This is a cloak which will let me disappear in a puff of green flame <i>on command?</i>”</p><p class="double">Rarity nodded.</p><p class="double">“Now <i>that&#039;s</i> cool. Thanks, and thank Spike for me.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.13</p><p class="double">Celestia yawned, shaking her head as her internal alarm woke her.</p><p class="double">About half an hour before dawn, so it wasn&#039;t long before she had to relieve her sister. But, hopefully, long enough for a cup of tea and a biscuit.</p><p class="double">Acquiring both from a well-stocked cupboard, she dipped the biscuit delicately in the Earl Bay. (One thousand years and more of tea drinking gave one a <i>very</i> good idea of just how to get the most enjoyment out of a cup of tea.)</p><p class="double">Then she paused, biscuit half-nibbled, at the sight of an envelope.</p><p class="double">“How strange...” she mused. “Maybe Twilight had a message for me overnight?”</p><p class="double">Slitting the envelope open along the top with her horn, she unfolded the letter.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Dear Celestia,</p><p class="double">The statue broke, and I&#039;m out.&#039;</p><p class="double"></i>Celestia dropped her biscuit.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;This place is </i>so<i> samey.

Well, I don&#039;t, that&#039;s the whole point.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“There!” Luna shouted, pointing. “That is one of Discord&#039;s vile wiles!”</p><p class="double">Two other alicorns and a Guard Captain stared over the makeshift barricade.</p><p class="double">“Actually, I think that&#039;s an electric water filter...” Cadence volunteered uncertainly.</p><p class="double">The filter made a bloop sound, and then ceased to exist as a powerful spell smashed it to smithereens.</p><p class="double">“Luna...” Celestia said,&nbsp;&nbsp;wincing. “I know it&#039;s strange, but a machine that turns drinkable water into... drinkable water... is <i>not</i> one of Discord&#039;s creations.”</p><p class="double">A tapestry flapped, and then caught fire.</p><p class="double">“Got you!” Celestia grinned. Her grin turned into a frown as, rather than turning back into Discord, the tapestry simply continued to burn.</p><p class="double">“<i>Please</i> tell me my rulers aren&#039;t going to destroy half the castle...” Shining Armor muttered to himself.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be... at most one third?” Cadence tried.</p><p class="double">“Not really much better...”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.14</p><p class="double">“Sorry, Princess,” Mac said with a tone of regret tinting his voice. “Y&#039;all have had enough.

Huh.”</p><p class="double">Mac began to say something, stopped, then sighed. “Okay, look. Clearly y&#039;all have had a bad loop, so ah&#039;m gonna get Twilight to take over the whole sky-thing. Just don&#039;t drink the stuff in the red-tagged bottles, they ain&#039;t ready just yet.”</p><p class="double">“Still fermenting?” Celestia asked, using her magic to take out a bottle without a red tag and pop the cork.</p><p class="double">“Fermentin&#039;, percolatin&#039; and in one case procrastinatin&#039;.” Mac shrugged. “Ah just call &#039;em in progress. They&#039;ll be done later this loop.”</p><p class="double">“Right.” Celestia took another look at the red-tagged bottles, then shrugged. “Thanks.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s mah job,” Mac replied with a smile. “You want t&#039; talk about it?”</p><p class="double">Celestia shuddered. “One word. Celestai.”</p><p class="double">“...ain&#039;t all that sure ah get it, actually, Princess...” Mac admitted.</p><p class="double">“Good. Suffice to say I spent most of my time reconstructing alien races and apologizing profusely.” The Princess of the Sun downed a glass. “I <i>will</i> talk about it more later, but... for now, alcohol.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">70.15</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re worse at this than my mother!” Silver called, clapping her paws on the ground and producing a large earthen mallet. The mallet slammed into the volleyball, sending it rocketing off towards the net.</p><p class="double">As soon as it cleared the line of string, it slowed to hang in mid-air.</p><p class="double">“Your mother&#039;s a Canis Minor this loop, she&#039;s not exactly good at volleyball!” Diamond Tiara replied, frowning, and the ball twitched, then shot back across the line.</p><p class="double">The star-beast known as Procyon Silveris jumped into the air, balancing briefly on an alchemically-hardened disc of air, and then slammed both forepaws into the volleyball.</p><p class="double">Which promptly exploded.</p><p class="double">Silver landed, and winced. “Whoops... sorry, DT.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s the <i>third time,</i> for goodness&#039; sakes!” Tiara&#039;s eye twitched, then she sighed. “It rather looks as though we won&#039;t be able to get this game to work, Silver. Sorry, but you&#039;re not... built... for it.”</p><p class="double">“Yeah, I gotcha.” Silver&#039;s tail drooped. “Kinda wish my body&#039;d make up its mind what shape I should be. I mean, variety is kind of interesting, but this is ridiculous.”</p><p class="double">Tiara nodded. “Sucks, yeah.”</p><p class="double">She trotted over as Silver lay down, and sat back against her flank.</p><p class="double">For several minutes, they just enjoyed the sunlight. Silver began to emit a kind of lupine purr, tail thumping on the ground.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re a star-wolf, not a cat,” Tiara sniggered.</p><p class="double">Silver stuck her tongue out.</p><p class="double">“Actually,” Tiara went on, rummaging in her Pocket for a moment. “I do have something we could do.”</p><p class="double">“Oh?” Silver looked over.</p><p class="double">“Well, when Spike and I are doing TK practise, we usually use something which would let us know if we moved it too jerkily. So – and not to racially stereotype here – I happen to have a dingly ball. Want to play fetch?”</p><p class="double">“...sure, why not.” Silver got up and stretched. “May as well. I mean, if there&#039;s nothing better to do.”</p><p class="double">Tiara grinned. “Do you want the ball? See the ball? Fetch!”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s unfair!” Silver&#039;s voice drifted back to her. The voice&#039;s owner was already nearly halfway across the field, following the dingly ball at a flat run.</p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

Sorry.&quot;</p><p class="double">The astromech took a moment to examine an exposed coolant line with a worried twitter.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So much for my careful plotting of our lone star destroyer,&quot; said Luke, entering data into the navicomputer.</p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t sweat it. Variant loops happen to everypony,&quot; responded Scootaloo. &quot;Main power&#039;s on line. How&#039;s that departure clearance going, Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">A second Star Destroyer had arrived just as the smuggling pair got into their cockpit seats. A hasty departure checklist was now nearing completion.</p><p class="double">&quot;Getting the runaround as expected. I think they&#039;re about to seal the spaceport,&quot; said Twilight.</p><p class="double">{{So we launch without clearance as usual,}} grunted Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;ve got activity outside the bay,&quot; called Spike via comlink. &quot;I make it an augmented squad of stormtroopers.&quot; He was perched in the dorsal airlock as a lookout.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not a problem unless they brought an E-Web. Takeoff in twenty seconds. Get yourselves strapped in back there!&quot; replied Scootaloo. She eyed the controls for the ground-defense auto-blaster anyway.</p><p class="double">{{Engines are go,}} announced the wookiee.</p><p class="double">&quot;Then let&#039;s blow this sandbox. Punch it!&quot;</p><p class="double">The repulsorlifts floated the <i>Falcon</i> above the rim of the docking bay, then the main engines took over and the ship screamed for space...after a brief aerobatic indulgence.</p><p class="double">Luke eyed the pilot with a stony gaze. Twlight&#039;s expression was less severe, but still fairly stern.</p><p class="double">{{Were those three barrel rolls really necessary?}} asked Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh. Sorry. Couldn&#039;t resist.&quot;</p><p class="double">As thrilling skin-of-your-teeth escapes went, it was rather anticlimactic.</p><p class="double">Their departure course brought them into extreme turbolaser range of the incoming Star Destroyer for about fifteen seconds, but other than that, it was an almost leisurely jaunt to the edge of Tatooine&#039;s gravity well. Having the proper hyperspace route entered -- From memory: Luke was <i>very</i> familiar with these calculations -- before takeoff was icing on the cake.</p><p class="double">Why they faced no TIE fighters -- as in the baseline -- was a mystery.</p><p class="double">Scootaloo&#039;s disappointment was palpable as she engaged the hyperdrive. &quot;I know that advance planning makes for low-stress loops, but relaxing is one thing, dull is another.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I suppose we could make this an entirely baseline run and then you could volunteer for Y-Wing duty at Yavin,&quot; suggested Luke. &quot;Would that be sufficiently not-dull for you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah...heh heh...I withdraw the comment.&quot;</p><p class="double">{{We have about eight hours en route until we reach the Alderaan system,}} said Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">&quot;That being the case, I&#039;m going to take a nap. Wake me in two hours,&quot; declared Twilight going aft to the bunk compartment.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Scootaloo? Kin I use yer spare astromech fer somethin&#039;?&quot; asked Apple Bloom when Scootaloo entered the main compartment with Luke, Spike and Chewbacca in tow.</p><p class="double">&quot;But you <i>are</i> an astromech.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Thing is, there&#039;s somethin&#039; on my mind that I&#039;d like to take care of.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay fine.&quot;</p><p class="double">One odd spacial distortion later, a second R2 unit was next to Apple Bloom. It was painted a familiar sky blue with a rainbow pattern applied to the panels on its dome. It twittered confusion at its surroundings with Apple Bloom beeping and crooning reassurances. The human and wookiee traded bemused looks. Spike looked on impassively.</p><p class="double">&quot;Does Rainbow Dash know about this droid?&quot; asked Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;I keep meaning to mention it, but it kinda slips my mind whenever we meet,&quot; admitted the pilot.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom had interfaced her scomp link with the other astromech and was now performing a data transfer. With a chirp of satisfaction, she completed the task and withdrew the computer probe arm. &quot;There. R2-RD now has a another copy of the Death Star plans. Literally a load off my mind. Y&#039;all want me to keep it, or do ya have room fer it now?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Might give it to Twilight to store with my X-Wing until we have a chance to transfer them both back to me.&quot;</p><p class="double">{{As long as we&#039;re discussing hidden assets, there is a minor issue that has just occurred to me,}} started Chewbacca. {{Part of our standard Death Star infiltration pattern involves employing stormtrooper armor as disguises. Master Luke has a set that fits quite nicely, but it occurs to me that the young lady lacks any similar equipment, and her dimished stature -- no offense intended, I merely observe an inconvenient fact -- makes such a disguise problematical in any event.}}</p><p class="double">&quot;I think I have a holographic disguise unit that might work,&quot; suggested Spike. &quot;I don&#039;t have much usable image data from this time period, so we&#039;ll need to someone do a complete visual scan of a set of stormtrooper armor to program the thing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Meanin&#039; me,&quot; mumbled Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">&quot;You weren&#039;t this grumpy about doing tech work when we were on the <i>Enterprise</i>,&quot; observed Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;On the <i>Enterprise</i>, I had an entire engineering department to handle the borin&#039; stuff.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Look. I could just pull out OWL or one of my Hogwarts wands, but as long as I&#039;m supposedly &#039;taking it easy&#039;, I might as well try some other magical implementations,&quot; said Twilight.</p><p class="double">After her brief nap, she and Spike had gone to the aft cargo hold to perform some semi-private experimentation.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, fine. Just try not to do too much collateral damage while you work out how this is supposed to work. I&#039;m already a bit on-edge with the Crusaders here,&quot; replied Spike.</p><p class="double">Twilight produced a large wooden staff and shorter thick dowel from her subspace pocket. Both were intricately carved with an assortment of arcane sigils. Holding the staff in her left hand, she extended the dowell in her right and pointed it at an empty packing crate across the hold. Clearing her throat, she declared: &quot;Ghor!&quot;</p><p class="double">The crate shattered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wasn&#039;t that Klingon?&quot; asked Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Would you prefer I said &#039;Forzare&#039;? Anyway, it looks like the proof of concept worked.&quot; She tucked the blasting rod into her belt and leaned the staff against a bulkhead. &quot;For more subtle magic, I&#039;ll use these.&quot; She fished in her subspace pocket for what appeared to be a pair of extra-long bamboo cooking chopsticks. &quot;If memory serves, Harry explained that Molly prefers to use paired wands for her veils and illusion work. Let me know if you pick up any Force disturbances, okay?&quot;</p><p class="double">With a series of guttural mumbles and gestures with her wands, Twilight was suddenly three identical twi&#039;leks. One walked to the remains of the crate and looked at the debris. Another went to lean against the bulkhead next to the staff. The third climbed on top of another crate and sat down.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty smooth, Twilight. Didn&#039;t pick up anything when you triggered the spell. However...&quot; Spike took a small power cell from his belt and gently tossed it to an empty portion of the hold, where it thumped against a momentarily invisible form. The spell disrupted, the three illusory figures vanished. &quot;I could still find you. Were you making any attempt at hiding your Force signature?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not really. I&#039;m still seeing how well this kind of magic works here. If there&#039;s time, I&#039;ll work on masking my Force presence.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">They were all discussing increasingly outlandish plans for how to rescue Leia when Alderaan was destroyed.</p><p class="double">All three jedi displayed varying degrees of distress. &quot;I hate this part,&quot; muttered Luke. Twilight nodded agreement.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ooohhh. This really sucks. You have to go through this every loop?&quot; asked Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just about. There was one loop where Leia was able to get them to head for Dantooine, but that resulted in Vader killing her thirty seconds after they found out she was spinning a story. Not a good loop at all,&quot; said Luke with a haunted expression.</p><p class="double">&quot;Changing the subject,&quot; cut in Sweetie a tad over-enthusiastically. &quot;You mentioned you were going over the Death Star plans to see if there were any other vulnerabilities, Apple Bloom?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve got a few possibilities, but I suspect Artoo spotted them loops ago anyway. How much success has he had slicin&#039; the Death Star&#039;s network to induce weapon system shutdowns, reactor overloads and so on?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Mixed bag. Reactor system firewall&#039;s usually solid as duracrete. Same with superlaser power and targeting. He&#039;s had some success with forcing the defensive turbolasers to go on local control, but since they&#039;re not good at anti-fighter work anyway, it&#039;s not that big an edge against what the Alliance can throw against it on short notice,&quot; replied Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;What about navigation and propulsion?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Meh. About one time in six, he can cause a mis-jump or force a cold reboot of the hyperdrive. Nav data is stored in read-only form, so no easy way to send them wildly off-course.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, I&#039;ll look at the hyperdrive if time permits. Has he tried messin&#039; with the internal logistics systems?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Not that I recall. I take it you have an idea?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just the start of some notions. If I kin solidify the details, I think I may take a page from Pinkie&#039;s book, but that would require some magical assistance for the more...unconventional...items.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Let me know what you come up with, Apple Bloom, and I&#039;ll see what I can do.&quot; said Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;How does laying a false trail with the homing beacon work out?&quot; asked Sweetie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Not too badly. Going out to an uninhabited backwater and ditching the beacon buys us a few days before Tarkin gets restless and decides to attack another system. The problem is it&#039;s hard to predict what his next target will be, so destroying the thing is still an imperative.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wouldn&#039;t it be the same target each time?&quot; asked Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">&quot;Butterfly effect,&quot; explained Twilight. &quot;If you pull things far enough from the loop&#039;s baseline, random factors can take over.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Is that what that means?&quot; inquired Sweetie. &quot;I thought it had something to do with Fluttershy.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Reverting to normal space in thirty seconds. Shields up,&quot; announced Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">{{Comm jamming suite on standby,}} added Chewbacca.</p><p class="double">Luke and Twilight, seated in the communication and navigation seats behind the piloting duo, wore the abstracted expression common to jedi communing with the Force.</p><p class="double">The hyperspace vortex surround the ship gave way to star lines and eventually the starfield as seen from the Alderaan system. As expected, no blue-green sphere was visible. A much smaller and distant disk could be made out roughly ahead. The ship was jolted by a glancing impact with a small boulder-sized planetary fragment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Lone TIE fighter aproaching from astern,&quot; said Twilight softly.</p><p class="double">One abortive pursuit and tractor beam capture later, the Falcon was being pulled into a Death Star docking bay. Luke, Twilight, Scootaloo and Apple Bloom shared a privacy-spell shielded smuggling compartment as the imperials conducted their preliminary inspection of the &#039;abandoned&#039; freighter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Are you sure you can shield us from Vader&#039;s Force sense?&quot; Scootaloo asked for the fifth time.</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re sounding more and more like Han when he&#039;s feeling antsy,&quot; observed Luke.</p><p class="double">&quot;I wish I coulda rigged up that exterior audio-video surveilance system,&quot; lamented Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">The distinct tramp of armored boots on the deck plate above rang through the sound-suppressing magic.</p><p class="double">&quot;And...They&#039;re off the ship. Five to ten minutes before the scanning crew shows up,&quot; announced the future Jedi Grand Master as Scootaloo opened the compartment.</p><p class="double">Luke poked his head out just in time to see the compartment where Spike had secreted himself open. The barabel jedi murmured, &quot;I got a good sense of him. I&#039;m pretty sure it was mutual.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that&#039;s that confrontation set up. You sure you&#039;re up for it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike nodded. &quot;I have lots of ways to wrong-foot him long enough to cover our escape, and we&#039;ve got you and Twilight up our sleeves in case I need an assist. Anyway, we should probably get to our positions for the next bit.&quot; The other passengers and crew were quietly emerging to take up their ambush stations for the next phase.</p><p class="double">Seven minutes later, two techs laboriously set an equipment case down in the main compartment. Their surprise was considerable when they were suddenly confronted by a lavender twi&#039;lek who pointed a carved rod in their direction and grunted, &quot;yIQong!&quot;</p><p class="double">Their surprise instantly gave way to slumber.</p><p class="double">Spike and Luke eased the two bodies to the deck with gentle applicatoins of the Force. Luke lifted one end of the case to a height of half a meter and let it drop to the deck with a thud. &quot;Hey down there! Can you give us a hand with this?&quot; he called.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Subduing the personnel in the hangar monitoring office was another anticlimax. Finding out-of-the-way locations to secrete two unconscious techs, four stormtroopers, and one watch officer was only slightly more difficult. Scootaloo switched off her armor holoprojector with a sigh of relief. &quot;I don&#039;t care what you say, Apple Bloom. This thing itches like crazy.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight, who had found several sets of uniforms in a closet and was checking them for size to replace her current ensemble, absently explained, &quot;It&#039;s almost certainly a psychosomatic reaction. A simple holographic field shouldn&#039;t do anything to stimulate your peripheral nervous system.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t care. I&#039;m not using it longer than absolutely necessary.&quot;</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom trundled over to the computer interface socket and plugged in. &quot;Right...C&#039;mon...Great. I&#039;m in. No alarms raised. I&#039;m gonna need a minute or two to get my bearin&#039;s.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Why are you thinking about changing clothes?&quot; Luke asked Twilight.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can&#039;t keep up my veil very well in close quarters like a turbolift, and an Imperial uniform, even if worn by a nonhuman, will blend in better in a crowd here than this red-and-brown getup. At least it may give us that half-second of confusion that makes the diference in a crisis.&quot; She took a final look at the uniform and shrugged. &quot;Speaking of veils, back in a few minutes,&quot; she said with a wave of a wand and vanished.</p><p class="double">&quot;Anyone wonder why there&#039;re spare uniforms in a hangar office closet?&quot; mused Sweetie.</p><p class="double">Chewbacca pointed at a rumpled uniform jacket on the floor of the closet. A large caf stain was evident on the front. {{I&#039;d guess that one or more of the watch officers has had a few too many accidents with beverages.}}</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Apple Bloom would be the first to admit that she wasn&#039;t the best pure hacker among the Equestrian Loopers; that honor went to Pinkie Pie following her extended stint as &quot;Radical Pinkie&quot; aboard the <i>Bebop</i>.</p><p class="double">That said, she was definitely in the top five; roughly the equal of Twilight or Luna. Her current form did provide a modest boost to her abilities, and she also had a little extra help along for the ride.</p><p class="double"><i>You sure you’re up for this, Cookie? I kin understand if yer still tryin’ to adapt to the strangeness</i>, she asked her companion.</p><p class="double"><i>I have been witness to many of your exploits in this area. Although I lack your intuitive grasp of the finer details, I believe I can keep an eye out for trouble while your attention is otherwise occupied</i>, responded Cookie.</p><p class="double">Reassured, Apple Bloom slipped into the Death Star&#039;s network for a metaphorical quick reconnaissance followed by a set of surgical strikes.</p><p class="double">A delicate probe confirmed Luke&#039;s report that the main hypermatter reactor and superlaser systems were locked down almost as tight as than the Yggdrasil admins read-only restrictions on Gallifreyan technology.</p><p class="double">Turning her attention to the hyperdrive, she found a curious gap in the protocols surrounding system tests and emergency restart procedures. <i>Looks like a candidate for option 5</i>, suggested Cookie to Bloom&#039;s agreement.</p><p class="double">After leaving a few time-release gifts, she went on to examine the systems governing the internal logistics that handled starfighter maintenance and supply. To her delight, they proved amenable to several of the ideas she’d brainstormed with the others.</p><p class="double">A visit to the HoloNet comm system was also fruitful. Another gift was graciously left.</p><p class="double"><i>This exploration and low-level sabotage is all well and good, but don’t forget why we’re here</i>, reminded Puddinghead&#039;s one-time secretary.</p><p class="double"><i>Oh yeah. Whups</i>, responded a mildly chastened Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">Belatedly, she made a quick review of the detention records to confirm Leia’s location, and double-checked the tractor beam schematics.</p><p class="double">“Looks like we’re good fer option Esk-7,” she announced to the other loopers. “Leia’s where she oughta be, and the tractor beam power regulators are as expected.” The relevant locations were brought to a display screen for Spike to study. “Twilight, if you could pay a visit to storage bay 4823 and make the substitutions we discussed? It ain’t too far from Detention block AA-23.” A second screen indicated the two locations separated by just two decks. &quot;Lemme transfer the relevant info to yer datapad.&quot;</p><p class="double">“Sounds good,&quot; said the twi&#039;lek, now wearing Imperial officer&#039;s grays. She set the device to receive. &quot;I think I’ll drop by on the way out,” she decided. “We ready?” she asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Figger Cookie and me&#039;ll need about ten...fifteen minutes to finish reprogrammin&#039; our little surprises. We&#039;ll let y&#039;all know when we&#039;re done,&quot; said the astromech.</p><p class="double">The others indicated that they were prepared for their own tasks.</p><p class="double">“Then may the Force be with us,” said Luke.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Princess Awoke in her cell and took a long moment to consider her Loop memories. <i>This is definitely not where I usually start things.</i></p><p class="double">Her musings were cut short by a commotion from outside. An almost animalistic roar punctuated by staccato reports of blaster fire, panicked yells, muffled explosions and...was that the low hum of lightsabers?</p><p class="double">The noise faded after several intense seconds. She took a moment to sit up a little straighter on the ledge that served as the cell&#039;s bunk and twitched her white robe into some sort of order.</p><p class="double">The door opened to reveal a lavender-hued twi&#039;lek female in oversized Imperial officer&#039;s grays. She was incongruously carrying a carved two meter wooden staff in her left hand and a deactivated lightsaber in her right. <i>There&#039;s something oddly familiar about that face</i>, she thought.</p><p class="double">An expression of startled recognition crossed the visitor&#039;s features. The twi&#039;lek then said, hesitantly: &quot;Sunshine, sunshine...Ladybugs awake...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Clap your hooves and do a little shake,&quot; responded Princess Cadance Organa with an almost hysterical giggle. After another long look, she asked, &quot;Aren&#039;t you a little tall for a pony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Har har har,&quot; replied Twilight flatly. &quot;C&#039;mon. Let&#039;s go find your &#039;brother&#039;. And wait &#039;til you meet your prospective love interest...&quot; </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>72.1 (Stainless Steel Fox)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><u><b>Turning the Tables – Final part... Start!</b></u></p><p class="double">“Behold! The palace of the twin pony sisters!” Blueblood declaimed, pointing at the ruined structure with a hoof.</p><p class="double">“That indeed is our address/why did you give it so much stress?” asked Zecora.</p><p class="double">Blueblood looked at her as if she were simple. “Because in the near future I&#039;m going to be telling most of Canterlot society of my part in this adventure, and I want to make sure I have some good lines.”</p><p class="double">That got an actual laugh out of most of the other ponies, to which he added, “What? I wasn&#039;t joking!”</p><p class="double">However, he didn&#039;t seem particularly offended either, a far cry from how they&#039;d have expected him to act a few hours ago. Then Rainbow Dash said, “Y&#039;know, I can see where he&#039;s coming from. I need to be thinking up some good one liners...”</p><p class="double">Twilight said, “I think they&#039;ll be enough daring do to go around. Right now we&#039;ve got a canyon to cross, and that rope bridge is out.”</p><p class="double">“Not for long!” Dash lived up to her name, zipping across the canyon and hauling up the broken bridge.</p><p class="double">“Uh Twi, couldn&#039;t you just do your teleport thing, or lift us all across?” Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">“Not if we can do this without magic. Teleporting risks the Everfree magic messing with my targeting, and high level telekinesis would leave me vulnerable to a counter-spell. Maybe in an emergency...”</p><p class="double">In truth she could probably do either, even without going full alicorn, but her in-loop self would have suffered those limits. If she wanted to power through it she could have done so without dragging every-pony along and risking their lives. She was monitoring Dash despite the closing in mists, expecting the usual approach by the Shadowbolts.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom was looking around alertly, her green glowing eyes narrowed in thought. “Maybe I can fix up another way across. I&#039;m good at fixing things.”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo was right at the end of the bridge, watching her idol eagerly as Dash secured one of the rope handrails. “Huh, who are those guys coming towards her?”</p><p class="double">Dash was feeling good, no she was feeling awesome. Finally, a chance to shine! For all that she was a part of the expedition, she hadn&#039;t really had much to do apart from fending off those nightmare crows at the start. A warm, happy glow stole over her as she imagined the Wonderbolts offering her a slot for her part in rescuing Princess Celestia. The whole thing was almost dream-like...</p><p class="double">“Rainbow...” the voice whispered behind her and she jumped round to face it.</p><p class="double">“Who&#039;s there?” She couldn&#039;t see anyone at first, but the voice spoke again.</p><p class="double">“Rainbow...”</p><p class="double">“Show yourself! I ain&#039;t scared of you!” It was true, right now she felt like she could fight Manticores and win.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;ve been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the best flyer in Equestria.” Three figures emerged from the shadows, quietly enough to be shadows themselves.</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash tried to focus on them, three pegasi in sleek flight suits. For some reason she was finding it hard to concentrate on the details. “Who?”</p><p class="double">“Why, you, of course.” the middle one said.</p><p class="double">“Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me.” In hindsight she should have thought of that immediately. It was nice for some-pony to recognise her talents right away, especially ponies who were obviously professional fliers. “Hey, uh, you wouldn&#039;t mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? &#039;cause I&#039;ve been trying to get into that group for like, ever.”</p><p class="double">“No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us, The Shadowbolts. We&#039;re the greatest aerial team in the Everfree Forest, and soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria, but first, we need a captain. The most magnificent, swiftest, bravest flyer in all the land.”</p><p class="double">Ha, she&#039;d been right, professionals. At the back of her mind there was a sense that something was odd about the whole thing, but mostly she preened at the complements. She chuckled, “Yes, it&#039;s all true.”</p><p class="double">“We need... you.” The Shadowbolt&#039;s finalwords were like a dream come true. She&#039;d finally been picked up by a professional team, and not just as a member but as captain. “WOOHOO! Sign me up!”</p><p class="double">Twilight and the others would love to hear about this... That thought pierced through the clouds of glory that surrounded her, oh yes, she&#039;d come here for a reason. “Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.”</p><p class="double">“No! It&#039;s them or us!” The clouds seemed to get thicker and the Shadowbolts&#039; speaker grew harsher.</p><p class="double">Rainbow thought she heard voices calling out to her, but maybe it was the wind. Wow, this was a toughie. She felt the desperate need to take this once-in-a-lifetime offer push away at the desire to help her friends. Fixing that bridge and getting them get across was important for some reason she couldn&#039;t quite remember, but so was this. Surely they&#039;d understand that and forgive her.</p><p class="double">“Well?”The Shadowbolt prompted her, and she made her decision.</p><p class="double">“You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I&#039;m afraid I have to say no.”</p><p class="double">Her friends might forgive her but she wouldn&#039;t forgive herself for leaving them stranded. She turned to fix the bridge, and heard the Shadowbolt say, “Then you are of no further use to us...”</p><p class="double">The voice had grown even harsher and more familiar, and she looked back to see the three of them leap at her. The comforting fog around her brain cleared in an instant, Nightmare Moon! The quest! She didn&#039;t have any more time to think as she was suddenly swarmed by the three pegasi.</p><p class="double">The clouds that had covered the chasm had cleared away with the breaking of the charm, and the group could see Rainbow fighting against the three figures. Scootaloo instantly charged forward and jumped onto the single rope handrail that had been secured, running across it and using her wings and her unreasonable kinesthetic sense to keep her stable.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom was moving too, but away from the gap. She ploughed into an overhang where a large dead tree, half it&#039;s roots washed bare, stood like some ancient sentinel. Her claws went to work, tearing out roots and digging out dirt, and in seconds it started to topple towards the gorge. It crashed down on an outgrowth of brush at the very lip of the canyon and came to rest, still partly rooted in the bank at one end, and jutting out over half way out over the drop like a pier at the other.</p><p class="double">“Big Mac, could you keep your weight on that end?” Apple Bloom was already running back and springing onto the barrel of the trunk. Applejack tried to run over and stop her, but she was already past. Big Macintosh saw that and ran over to the roots to do just what she&#039;d asked.</p><p class="double">The Apple family filly did find one roadblock on her path, Sweetie Belle, who&#039;d clambered up on the trunk right at the lip. “You and Scootaloo aren&#039;t leaving me behind... whaa!”</p><p class="double">The last exclamation was due to Apple Bloom scooping her up by ducking her head under the little unicorn&#039;s girth without breaking stride and letting her come to rest across her shoulders. Sweetie Belle grabbed onto the wooden neck with both hooves and the leafy mane with her teeth for dear life as they galloped out across the makeshift bridge. They reached the end and Apple Bloom leapt with everything she had, soaring off the end of the tree and just managing to touch down on the far side, scrabbling with her hind claws to pull herself up.</p><p class="double">Rainbow was a trained martial artist in the Wing Chun style of karahane - unarmed wing fighting – but taking on three opponents at once was straining even her awesomeness. She&#039;d just taken a solid hit from the Shadowbolts&#039; leader which had left her open for a devastating double hoof attack from one of the others. Then a small orange missile, wings blurring like a hummingbird propelled itself into the face of the one about to hit her.</p><p class="double">“YOU LEAVE RAINBOW DASH ALONE!” Scootaloo was less than half the size of her opponent, and less than half the strength, but right then it didn&#039;t matter as even the weight of a filly when travelling at sufficient velocity was enough to bowl the luckless Shadowbolt over. It didn&#039;t stop there as the little pegasus proceeded to grab onto her head and neck and proceed to belabour her with hooves, wings and teeth.</p><p class="double">“Scootaloo?” Rainbow Dash exclaimed in surprise.</p><p class="double">The Shadowbolt leader fared worse as a timberwolf with a white unicorn pounced on it and smashed it to the ground, claws instinctively ripping into it. It gave an unearthly screech and evapouraed into black smoke. Meanwhile Sweetie Belle vaulted from Apple Bloom&#039;s shoulders onto the back of the third one. She straddled it&#039;s neck, breathed in, leaned close to it&#039;s ear, and sang out a highly focussed note with the full power of her lungs that started somewhere around high C and finished six feet deep in the Shadowbolt&#039;s skull. It dropped like a sack of potatoes and evaporated.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, Scootaloo&#039;s opponent had regained it&#039;s hooves, and bucked her off, sending the pegasus flying to land at the top of a flying buttress. The section of decorative finial she&#039;d grabbed onto as she landed pulled loose from it&#039;s setting, and she just managed to scramble on top of it to avoid being crushed. It started sliding down the buttress with her on it. She kept it balanced by pure instinct, and saw that two of the Shadowbolts had reformed, and more were forming on the ground below.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom had gone to work securing the other bridge ropes (paws being better than hooves at that) while Rainbow Dash and Sweetie Belle covered her, the first with a two-wing beat-down on any Shadowbolt that came close, the other by flinging gravel at them. It was an unfair fight, but fortunately not one Scootaloo had to put up with. Grinding down the length of the buttress, she made minute adjustments as she went, and judged the final trajectory exactly. She flew off the end and dropped the chunk of solid stone across three of the attackers, smoking them.</p><p class="double">“Whoa! Smooth move there kiddo!” Rainbow Dash cheered her, and Sweetie Belle cried out, “Wow! You really rocked them!”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo preened for a second, then ducked one of the others as it lashed out with it&#039;s fore-hooves. She backed up into the line with the others, joined by Apple Bloom who&#039;d just finished attaching the last rope. They were a forlorn hope to cover the end of the rope bridge against the dozen Shadowbolts that had formed, but fortunately they weren&#039;t alone for long. There was a cry of &#039;Bully up!” and one of the Shadowbolt&#039;s vanished as a polo ball hit it at barely sub-sonic speed.</p><p class="double">The rest of the party came pelting across the rope bridge, spreading out as they arrived to combat the Shadowbolts. Prince Blueblood was swinging his polo mallet and shooting balls like a very posh barbarian, while Zecora had a sling in her mouth which she used to launch small balls of powder that poofed into a cloud each time it hit, and made the Shadowbolts melt away. Pinkie Pie had somehow popped up behind them, and somehow else brought out her party cannon, assaulting them with rock cake from the rear.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle had been monitoring things despite the clouds, and was once again surprised at just how capable the three fillies could be when they just did something without worrying about their cutie marks. However, as soon as the bridge was up, she&#039;d joined the others in galloping across, and added blasts of magic that punched through the reinforcements and popped them like mirror clones.</p><p class="double">Shining Armour was beside her, manifesting a guard longspear that cut and thrust, while Rarity, initially carrying a length of plaited vines to bind them, instead used it like a whip to grab one that was menacing Sweetie Belle and fling it into the gorge, wings bound. “Get away from her you ruffian!”</p><p class="double">The only ponies missing were the two older Apples and Fluttershy until there was a crash in the distance, and Big Mac appeared from the direction of Apple Bloom&#039;s improvised tree springboard which from the sound had clearly sprung it&#039;s last. Applejack was riding his timber-wolf shoulders like a surfer, and sprang into the fray as Mac dived in forepaws slashing.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy floated over more slowly, clearly staying up and out of the way. Two Shadowbolt clones flew up to intercept her just as another one got up on Big Macintosh&#039;s back, biting away and pulling away a chunk of wood from his body. The flying Shadowbolts were flung aside and sent spiralling out of the sky by a yellow and pink streak as Fluttershy dived down to check on him, incidentally flattening the attacking Shadowbolt in the process.</p><p class="double">While they were more than holding their own against the wave of Shadowbolts, the manifestations of Nightmare Moon&#039;s will kept respawning, while her ponies were only mortal. She ducked her head and blasted a path clear through the attackers. “Forge ahead! Get to the main hall!”</p><p class="double">They fought their way through, despite everything the Shadowbolts did to stop them, and as the last of them entered the hall, Shining Armour put up a shield. It wouldn&#039;t take them long to get around it, but for the moment they were clear, and Twilight wasn&#039;t going to waste time. Doing the whole jump after Nightmare Moon and charge her might be epic, but she had no intention of leaving her party. Besides, they&#039;d all worked their cutie-marks off getting here, and they deserved to see the pay-off.</p><p class="double">Even as they entered the hall, her telekinesis reached out and grabbed the five stone balls that were the husks of the original elements. Each one flew off it&#039;s pedestal to land before the fore-hooves of it&#039;s respective element. “Claim them, grab hold. Once you bond even Nightmare Moon won&#039;t be able to take them away!”</p><p class="double">She&#039;d confirmed this, even Discord, for all his power, wasn&#039;t able to remove Applejack&#039;s necklace while she was wearing it, though he&#039;d tried. She sent a pulse of magic through the husks, shattering them and forcing them to float up around their owners as glowing crystals.</p><p class="double">“NOOO! How could you find what I could not see?” Nightmare Moon manifested in front of the pedestal of the elements, looking furious, and more Shadowbolts formed around them. “A bunch of mere ponies! I will not be denied! I...”</p><p class="double">Then she started laughing. “You foals! The set is incomplete! You only have five of them! Your Elements are useless against me! Now I will destroy you where you stand!”</p><p class="double">A massive bolt of lightning lashed from her horn, sister to the one Twilight had blocked back at the town hall, and the ponies cringed, but Shining Armour&#039;s shiled slammed down to protect them, and Twilight returned a blast of purple energy of her own that not only dispersed it, but slammed into Nightmare Moon and sent her horn over cutie-mark backwards, shattering the pedestal of the Elements.</p><p class="double">“Ohhh!” winced Pinkie, “I hope Princess Celestia doesn&#039;t bill us for that!”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon staggered to her hooves, shaking her head in disbelief. “How! How could you, a mere unicorn have so much power?”</p><p class="double">“Partly because you&#039;ve split yours so many ways with all those Shadowbolt clones, and the bindings on Princess Celestia, and partly because I haven&#039;t just found the Elements, I had them with me the whole time! Those rocks? Just husks with no power you could sense. The Elements are that &#039;bunch of mere ponies&#039; that you so despise!”</p><p class="double">The Shadowbolt clones evaporated, the dark clouds they turned into rushing to merge with Nightmare Moon&#039;s aura. Even the sky outside turned to pre-dawn twilight as she drew in more power. “Then I will gather all my power and defeat you before you can find the sixth one!”</p><p class="double">Perfect. Twilight had hoped the mad mare would gather all her power to her, it would make the job of removing it simpler. She started trotting forwards, through Shining Armour&#039;s shield without disturbing it. “Also too late. I&#039;m very sorry, but this is where it ends.”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon lashed out with her dark aura to encompass the approaching unicorn, and the others could see glimpses of shadows, illusions of stacks of rare books, ancient magic treasures, a maze of corridors leading nowhere. The glowing fragments around Applejack collapsed in on her with a flash, leaving her wearing an amulet with an orange apple shaped gem shot a beam of energy at the shadows, dispersing them and coating Twilight in a faint orange aura.</p><p class="double">“Applejack is honest and true. She saw through your illusions in the forest, and would not let her own self-interest or her pre-conceptions divert her from the truth. That is why she&#039;s the Element of Honesty, and her friendship lets me see through your illusions now!”</p><p class="double">Two monstrous black panthers, each larger than a bear, sprang forward from the shadows to either side of Nightmare Moon, claws extended to rend and tear at the little purple unicorn. Big Mac and Shining Armour surged forward, but were stopped by a held up hoof from Fluttershy as her could of fragments coalesced into a rose coloured butterfly amulet. A pink beam surged from it and coated Twilight, and the unicorn&#039;s horn glowed in resonance. Two massive balls of yarn appeared between her and the panthers, and each felt to the ground, wrapped around one and playing with it like kittens.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy&#039;s gentle nature allowed her to see a Manticore as more than an enemy, and heal it&#039;s injury, allowing us to pass without fighting. Just as she gave me a way to stop your panthers without hurting them. Her compassion makes her the Element of Kindness.”</p><p class="double">More shadows rose up about the advancing unicorn, but this time the watching ponies could feel a shiver of uneasiness run down their spines as the glimpses suggested terrible things moving within. All except Pinkie who bounced up and down, “Ooh, ooh! This is my jam!”</p><p class="double">Her amulet coalesced around her neck, a blue balloon gem at it&#039;s heart, and a cerulean beam of energy flashed out to blast away the shadows with a burst of polka music. Twilight emerged chuckling, with another colour added to her aura. “Thanks Pinkie!”</p><p class="double">She turned her attention back to Nightmare Moon. “Really? Pinkie Pie broke your spell of fear once before with her unquenchable good spirits. You really thought the Element of Laughter couldn&#039;t do it again? You really are a one trick pony...”</p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon snarled, “Then see how you like this trick, foal! Or rather, lets see what your friends think!”</p><p class="double">A sickly yellow aura, shot through with black, oozed forward and around Twilight, somehow creeping under Shining Armour&#039;s barrier. It brushed the fore-hooves of the ponies scrambling back from it and they collapsed to their knees, screaming or groaning in pain.</p><p class="double">“NO!” The nimbus around Twilight swept out and corralled the yellow, drawing it away from the others and bringing it to focus on her. She went down on her belly, gasping with agony. She managed to hiss, “I... will... not... let... you... harm... them!”</p><p class="double">She could have blocked the pain with half a dozen different spells, but she didn&#039;t intend to. This was part of her penance for the way she&#039;d acted, manipulating ponies just like Celestia had, dragging them with her and putting them at risk when she could simply have powered her way through on her own. Besides, this was something she could handle within her self imposed in-loop limitations.</p><p class="double">She drew on the powers of the two remaining elements, or rather took what was freely offered, and both Rarity&#039;s and Rainbow Dash&#039;s amulets formed and added their own bursts of energy. It helped buffer and control the pain, and she started to rise to her hooves.</p><p class="double">“Rarity makes sacrifices to help ponies every day, whether it&#039;s helping a newcomer to town, or offering her tail to calm a sorrowful river serpent. She even convinced Prince Blueblood to follow her example! And Rainbow Dash wouldn&#039;t abandon her friends either for your offer of her hearts desire or when she faced a fight to the death to keep the way open.”</p><p class="double">She finally fully rose to her feet and flung her head back, gathering up the now polychromatic aura around her and bringing her horn back down to fling it at the yellow energies around her.</p><p class="double">“How could I do any less? I will protect my friends, not just the Elements but everyone who&#039;s helped us get this far. Blueblood, who&#039;s been far more of a true prince these last few hours than ever before. Zecora, who guided us through the Everfree. Big Macintosh and my big brother, who were our spear and shield through all your attacks. And the three fillies, Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, who showed their own quality back at the bridge, and proved it was of the highest.”</p><p class="double">Her aura surged forward against Nightmare Moon&#039;s attack and blasted it to pieces. “You didn&#039;t just face the Elements, you faced all of Equestria! The only question was how long it would take you to lose!”</p><p class="double">She started pacing slowly forward again, and Nightmare Moon actually started scrambling back at her implacable advance. Her horn came down and an indigo blast of eldritch energy that wouldn&#039;t have embarrassed the main gun on a space battleship blasted forth. Every-pony watching (including zebras and temporary timber wolves) winced, gasped or in Pinkie case, pulled pom-pom&#039;s from somewhere and started cheering Twilight on.</p><p class="double">The blast hit Twilight... and splashed, spraying shards of black edged energy around her. When it died away, the unicorn was still standing, but now the polychromatic aura had formed a tight sheath around her body, flaring to produce great wings of multicoloured light and an ethereal mane and tail. On her head was a tiara, with a star shaped gem at it&#039;s heart.</p><p class="double">“Im... impossible!” Nightmare Moon stuttered, her former confident air completely gone. “You didn&#039;t have the sixth element! That blast should have erased you!”</p><p class="double">“It was said that when the five elements were brought together, a spark would make the sixth appear. The spark was the spark of friendship in their hearts, and it awoke the spark in mine which lit a fire of friendship, as powerful as anything the Founders forged. That friendship, that magic is more powerful than anything you could ever hope to oppose. That is the sixth element, the element of magic...”</p><p class="double">Delivering the attack had clearly taken a lot out of the shadow mare, and she was barely standing. However, that didn&#039;t stop her trying to back away further. “No... NO... STAY BACK!”</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head. “I&#039;m sorry, but your name says it all, and so does mine. You&#039;re nothing but a nightmare, a bad dream of Princess Luna&#039;s, and she needs to wake up. Your night has ended, and this Twilight heralds the dawn...”</p><p class="double">A blade of polychromatic aura extended from her horn, and she struck, cutting through and through the other alicorn&#039;s body in a way that would have seriously inconvenienced Princess Luna if the blade had been a physical thing. Thankfully it wasn&#039;t. The first time she&#039;d used the Elements against Nightmare Moon she used them like a hammer, smashing the Nightmare Mooniness out of Princess Luna at the cost of taking most of her power with it. However, a hundred loops of practice and study had given her a degree of finesse.</p><p class="double">Now she sliced away at the corruption in Luna&#039;s spirit like a scalpel, cutting away only what was necessary. The Nightmare armour fell to the ground around the body of the Lunar princess, and shreds of black aura flowed away, fleeing the trenchant blade of light. At the end, the figure lying on the floor was midnight blue, her ethereal mane a clear night sky rather than a dark nebula. The blackness coalesced, even the armour melting into it, and tried to flee only to be corralled by a sphere of light.</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eyes were glowing pure white as she looked up at the remnants of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">“No. This ends now.” She considered saying something like &#039;Taste the Rainbow.&#039; but decided it would be tacky and in poor taste. Besides, she just wanted it to be over. The glow of her horn intensified and the sphere blazed for a second, then popped, leaving no trace of Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">She turned to face the rst of the group, and let her eyes return to normal. “It&#039;s over... finally. Zecora, Fluttershy I need you to check Princess Luna to see if she&#039;s okay. I did my best, but there&#039;s no telling what damage the Nightmare did, or her imprisonment. Speaking of healing ponies...”</p><p class="double">Her horn glowed again, the light washing over them, and when it faded every-pony was healed of all the minor injuries and scrapes that they&#039;d suffered. Blueblood had his immaculately groomed tail back, and both Big Mac and Apple Bloom were back to their pony forms. Macintosh gave a sigh of relief, but Apple Bloom actually looked down at her hooves and went, “Aww!”</p><p class="double">“My tail, my beautiful tail!” Blueblood was prancing around like a filly. “It&#039;s back! It&#039;s wonderful! It&#039;s....”</p><p class="double">He suddenly realised that all the other ponies were looking at him, and came to a stop, trying to look nonchalant. “... nothing I couldn&#039;t have done without, but jolly good, carry on.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash flew over and gave his mane a noogie. “It&#039;s okay, we get it! Y&#039;know, for a stuck up Canterlot type, you&#039;re alright.”</p><p class="double">Rarity appeared to teleport over to him with a comb out, and started restoring his hair. “Well I thought you were wonderful! I&#039;m just sorry you lost your air-ship.”</p><p class="double">Twilight grinned. “About that...”</p><p class="double">She pointed to the open doorway, and ponies who turned to look saw that Blueblood&#039;s air-ship, fully repaired and immaculate, was anchored in the courtyard. She shrugged. “Harmony powers, go figure! Which reminds me...”</p><p class="double">The polychromatic aura split into it&#039;s component parts and each one shot back into it&#039;s respective amulet, which glowed and faded away, seeming to sink into it&#039;s wearer&#039;s body. Her own tiara turned into a spot of light and vanished into the tip of her horn.</p><p class="double">“Congratulations guys, each of you now has your Element fully active. No-pony can take it from you, and you can summon it with an effort of will...”</p><p class="double">She was cut off as her brother galloped over and hugged her. “Twiley, that was amazing! I knew you were powerful but that... I mean wow!”</p><p class="double">“Hey, that wasn&#039;t just me!” This was true, she&#039;d kept pretty much to her in-loop power levels and used the Elements exactly as she would in-loop, given the necessary skill. She felt the need to explain further. “It was all of us together, just as I told Nightmare Moon. I could see the connections between us, together as friends, the marks of our destinies combined. It created a limitless pool of magic, magic without end...”</p><p class="double">Suddenly she realised what she&#039;d just said, and winced as feathered purple wings burst from her back. Oh well, since she had them... she proceeded to hug her brother.</p><p class="double">Princess Luna was struggling to get to her hooves, and Fluttershy was struggling to help her by getting under her wing as a support until Big Mac trotted across. “Miss Fluttershy, maybe I can help?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy seemed ready to shy away from the big stallion until she saw an apple twig that was still stuck in his mane. “Yes... thank you, but you can call me Fluttershy, if you don&#039;t mind that is.”</p><p class="double">He smiled openly, and she smiled back. As he took her place and easily helped Princess Luna to her hooves, he said, “I&#039;d like that very much... Fluttershy.”</p><p class="double">Princess Luna seemed to be coming out of a dazed state, fully restored to the mare she noramlly didn&#039;t appear as until her first Nightmare Night. “I... what was I thinking!”</p><p class="double">She shook her head as if to clear it, then looked around at the assembled ponies, her eyes glassy with unshed tears. “I am so sorry for what happened, what I did...”</p><p class="double">Zecora spoke first. “A nightmare held you in it&#039;s thrall/Your power at it&#039;s beck and call. We all saw how you mind was clouded/I&#039;m sure you would not have allowed it/to do such things as those we faced/when we did travel to this place. Now come and drink this herbal brew/It will be good for what ails you.”</p><p class="double">In the short time she&#039;d had, she&#039;d somehow set up a cauldron, a low tripod of sticks with a cloth pouch hanging between them and a candle with a green flame heating it from underneath. In it was boiling some water that steamed and bubbled with strange scents. Zecora expertly decanted it into an earthenware cup with tribal symbols on it, and offered it to the Princess.</p><p class="double">Pinkie bounced over and examined it as the Princess somewhat gingerly took it in her telekinetic grasp. “Ooh! Ooh! Is that some mystic vessel carved with powerful symbols that increase the potency of it&#039;s contents? Huh? Huh?”</p><p class="double">Zecora smiled. “It&#039;s from my homeland, that is true. As to what the symbols do/they spell out in a scheme most clever/A simple message, &#039;Best auntie ever!&#039;”</p><p class="double">Luna sipped and smacked her lips. “It is... tea. Very good tea!”</p><p class="double">Pinkie offered her a paper wrapped cup-cake that somehow had her moon crescent cutie-mark on in black and white icing. “This is my special recipe, &#039;Glad you&#039;re no longer an evil Nightmare and welcome back after a thousand years&#039; cup-cake. I wanted to throw a party but I&#039;ve used all the ammunition for my party cannon so we&#039;ll have to wait until we get back to Ponyville...”</p><p class="double">Luna looked at her a bit oddly, as most ponies did when first confronted with Pinkie Pie, but quickly lost any inhibitions about finishing off the cake once she&#039;d tasted it. “Most delicious, Miss...”</p><p class="double">“Pie. Pinkie Pie. But there&#039;s no need to call me Miss Pie, though you probably do after a thousand years without any. I&#039;ll make sure there&#039;s plenty at the party!”</p><p class="double">Luna gulped down the rest of the tea eagerly as she listened, and handed back the empty mug with a brief sentence of liquid syllables. Zecora bowed her head in acknowledgement. “You are welcome. It is grand/to hear the speech of my homeland. Zecora is my name you see/I study the plants of the Everfree.”</p><p class="double">Sweetie Belle edged up, accompanied by the other two proto-Crusaders. Apple Bloom asked, “Are you a really for-real princess?”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo snorted. “She must be! She&#039;s got wings and a horn, just like Princess Celestia, duh!”</p><p class="double">“I really like your mane!” Sweetie Belle exclaimed with a squeak.</p><p class="double">Luna looked down at them, her expression falling. “I was once, children. Whether I am after what I did is another matter.”</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy came up beside them. “I&#039;m sure you will be, Princess Luna. You were just sad and angry and unwell, but now you&#039;re all better...”</p><p class="double">Having said her piece, she ducked back behind Big Macintosh. Pinkie took over. “Oh yes, Twilight told us all about how those meanie-pants ponies didn&#039;t appreciate all the work you put into your nights. I mean, who does that? Night is when all the best parties happen! If ponies didn&#039;t like my parties any more, I get pretty unhappy too!”</p><p class="double">“Pinkie!” Rarity came trotting across, Blueblood in tow. “I&#039;m most dreadfully sorry your highness if my sister or Pinkie offended you...”</p><p class="double">“In truth, I am just glad you are not all scared of me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash exclaimed, &quot;Uh huh, Nightmare Moon was scary - not that she scared me of course, but guess she might have been for less amazing ponies - but you&#039;re cool! And those wings, how fast can you go?&quot;</p><p class="double">Her own wings flexed as if to take off and Luna grinned. &quot;I am Luna, mine light doth cross the world in the course of a single night. I Can Outpace The Darkness, TRAVEL WITH THE SPEED OF THOUGHT!&quot;</p><p class="double">She&#039;d closed her eyes and reared as she said the last part in the Royal Canterlot Voice. Then she dropped down and finished, &quot;In short, pretty fast... ahhh, I&#039;m sorry, I didn&#039;t mean to get carried away!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s mane and wings were blown back and her eyes were wide. Her face split in a wide grin. &quot;That... was... awesome!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It is the Royal Canterlot voice, the speech it is normal to use to address our subjects... but right now I could rather do with friends.&quot; Luna looked back to Rarity. &quot;Maybe you could introduce me to them, Miss...”</p><p class="double">“Rarity your highness. My sister Sweetie Belle you&#039;ve already met...” She continued around the group, naming ponies who hadn&#039;t introduced themselves until she got to Blueblood, at which Luna nodded.</p><p class="double">“Of course, no Blueblood could resist such a great quest. Thy distant ancestors were ponies of valour and nobility; always leading others whether into battle or in more peaceful pursuits. I am pleased to see you continue the tradition, nephew.”</p><p class="double">Blueblood preened, “Of course, my liege. I am glad to see you unharmed by such an ordeal.”</p><p class="double">Luna smiled, “E&#039;en if that is still so, there is no need for such formality in this place and time. But where is my sister?”</p><p class="double">One of the side effects of using the Elements carefully was that in separating Luna from Nightmare Moon, Twilight hadn&#039;t automatically disrupted the bindings that held Celestia in the sun. She&#039;d waited a few moments to make sure Princess Luna was okay, and it had worked better than she&#039;d expected. The groundwork she&#039;d laid in making sure her friends saw Luna as separate from Nightmare Moon and in many ways her first victim meant that they were far more willing to approach her, and that acceptance in turn would help Luna&#039;s soul to heal faster.</p><p class="double">Still, it was about time... She tweaked a magical thread she&#039;d left untweaked and a whole network of bindings started to unravel. The twilight turned to dawn and Twilight turned to face the rising sun. Aglowing orb emerged and flew down, landing in the chamber and resolving itself into Princess Celestia.</p><p class="double">“Sister!” Luna started to charge forward, even as the other ponies turned and bowed low to the Solar princess, then came to a halt, her eyes downcast. “Sister, oh sister, I am so sorry for everything...”</p><p class="double">She was interrupted by a hug as Princess Celestia came forward and embraced her younger sister, tears forming. “Oh Luna, it&#039;s been a thousand years since I&#039;ve seen you like this! It&#039;s alright, I forgive you. I&#039;m just happy to see you&#039;re safe.”</p><p class="double">“Thank your courageous subjects, they braved the Everfree and all my darker side could throw at them, and freed me from my nightmare self.”</p><p class="double">As Princess Celestia looked beyond her sister for the first time, her eyes widened in surprise. “My goodness, this is unexpected...”</p><p class="double">Out of all the ponies, it was Applejack who spoke up. “Begging your pardon, your highnesses, but I reckon the one you want to thank most is Twilight. She pulled everything together and had it all figured out from the get go.”</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash took to the air, fore-hooves waving to emphasize her points. “Yeah, and when she was facing Nightmare Moon, Nightmare Moon was all &#039;Grrr, arrgh! I&#039;m going to destroy you and your little friends too!&#039; and Twilight was just &#039;Nuh-huh, not happening. And she went zap-pow, illusion, mind control, evil hurting spells, and Twilight just kept going like it some-pony throwing confetti and did her Elementy thing and it was just soooo awesome!”</p><p class="double">She finished off her speech with a back somersault in mid-air.</p><p class="double">Twilight had taken the chance to cast a low power perception filter over her wings for the moment, and when Celestia looked at her blushed and said, “It was a team effort. Every-pony here helped in some way. Having all the information beforehoof helped a lot.”</p><p class="double">Celestia actually looked guilty. “I&#039;m just glad Shining Armour managed to find you. I worried greatly when you left and we couldn&#039;t find you, and not just because of your studies.”</p><p class="double">“I was in a bad place for a while, but I made some good friends who helped me out of it.” Twilight looked back at her friends., and they smiled encouragingly.</p><p class="double">To be honest, things had worked out spectacularly. Luna was reconciled with her sister and would hopefully have an easier time of adapting to the modern world, not least because she&#039;d had some-pony other than her sister accept her. The Crusaders were together ahead of schedule (well you had to take the rough with the smooth), and Rainbow Dash and Scootaloo might just end up being almost sisters sooner than usual.</p><p class="double">There looked to be something going on between Fluttershy and Big Mac, and she&#039;d reconnected with her own big brother, which would hopefully mean she could head off Queen Chrysalis before she got too far. Blueblood had been a stunning surprise and deserved every bit of good press he was due, and for once the idea that he and Rarity might be friends wasn&#039;t a cause for hysterical laughter. Zecora would also get a far better reception in Ponyville with the Apples vouching for her, and Twilight herself was far closer to her friends than she had been in the base time-line.</p><p class="double">But she still felt guilty. She would have to have a discussion with Celestia about what was really going on and apologise. But first there would have to be...</p><p class="double">“... A Party!” Pinkie cried out with a cheer. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Okay, here we are in Ponyville. Thank you, gentlecolts.&quot; Twilight nodded to the guards as Spike hopped out of his chariot. &quot;Right. So, the plan is.... check on the preparations, and then get Vespertine to tell me how to beat Nightmare Moon.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>First step to beating Nightmare Moon: Turn around and say nothing.</i></p><p class="double">The unicorn raised an eyebrow at that, but followed the vague command... coming face to face with a wall of pink.</p><p class="double">Spike coughed. &quot;Um. Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Say nothing!</i></p><p class="double"><i>I&#039;m not saying anything!</i> Twilight thought back, awkwardly smiling at the blue eyes. <i>Who is this pony?! Why is she looking at me like that?!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, are you okay?&quot; Spike looked between the two ponies. &quot;I... Is Vespertine--?&quot;</p><p class="double">Suddenly the pink pony let out a long gasp. Just as suddenly she dashed away.</p><p class="double"><i>You have done well, my young padawan. Now, continue with your preparation checking.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Right--&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Did I say you could speak?!</i></p><p class="double"><i>No! Sorry, I assumed--</i></p><p class="double"><i>Because you totally can now. Actually you could always have spoken. Why are you listening to a voice in your head?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Because you&#039;re from the future, that&#039;s why!&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike sighed. &quot;I can tell this is going to be a long day...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.3 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">To: Occupants, Heaven of the Light Gods</p><p>From: Princess Twilight Sparkle</p><p>Subject: Dungeon Hearts, etc.</p><p class="double">To whom it may concern;</p><p class="double">I write today to register some complaints about my experiences while visiting your universe.</p><p class="double">I awoke in your world trapped in a subterranean room with no exits, with only an insane homicidal demon for company. This is not the sort of welcome any self-respecting god should give visitors from other dimensions.</p><p class="double">The demon informed me that my only option for escape from my prison, besides eventual death, was to sacrifice my soul to some unknown dark god in order to gain control over the powers of the dungeon heart in the center of the cave. I naturally refused. He made it clear that refusal was not an option, and that death would not be so much eventual as immediate. Said demon is now a small frog residing in a terrarium above my desk. I considered turning him into a bunny, but considering my past experience with bunnies, I decided he would still be too dangerous.</p><p class="double">Having pacified the demon, I blasted a hole to the surface of your world, whereupon I was immediately attacked by various humans claiming to be in your service. Although I took great care to cause no serious or permanent injury, it still took a great deal of time and effort to convince them to cease their attacks. A few commandments to your followers about the importance of good manners when greeting strangers would be helpful in future encounters.</p><p class="double">Once I indicated that the dungeon heart was inert and that I had nothing to do with it, your servants immediately destroyed it. I analyzed both the artifact and the methods used to destroy it, and I decided that both were woefully inefficient. Proper experimentation and training will improve performance.</p><p class="double">After all this, despite my efforts to be as friendly and helpful as possible, I was treated as common livestock. Attempts were made to cage, corral, and bind me so that I could be broken to the saddle and/or dissected for various magical reagents. My objections were ignored, and again it became necessary to convince your servants to desist.</p><p class="double">Since we had established that your servants were not going to act in a friendly and rational manner without coercion, I interrogated the chief cleric of the expedition, using methods I have learned from a couple of friends of mine, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie. Over the course of the afternoon, with the aid of a dozen cupcakes and the power of guilt, I learned enough about your world to levy the following complaints:</p><p class="double">(1) I can understand why you allow the dark gods, who are (despite your cleric&#039;s claims to the contrary) more or less equal in power to yourselves, to leave around traps such as Dungeon Hearts for the unwary and selfish. What I cannot understand is how you voluntarily cede tactical superiority to those same dark gods. Enclosed find plans for Castle Hearts (trademark pending) which require no sacrifice of souls and which operate through the magical principles of friendship and harmony. Of course, this will require you to increase harmony among your followers, which brings me to (2).</p><p class="double">(2) Even given that your followers are in battle for the very survival of their world with the Dungeon Keepers, the conduct you permit in them is inexcusable. Far too many of your followers are raiding dungeons for motivations even more base and vile than your average Keeper&#039;s. Greed for loot and pleasure in slaying one&#039;s enemies are qualities which proper light gods should NOT encourage. A spirit of sharing, tolerance, and acceptance of harmless differences should be encouraged by any light gods, and yet you have failed to do this. Instead you leave in place a feudal system in which a tiny, wealthy minority extracts wealth from serfs which they use for their own luxury and vanity, for pointless wars between one another, and only occasionally for the destruction of dungeons.</p><p class="double">(3) It is an adage in most universes that evil brings on its own destruction, since evil beings cannot cooperate for long without seeking ways to betray one another for advantage. Thus it is no surprise that Dungeon Keepers, like the dark gods they serve, squabble among themselves. It is inexcusable that your followers seem to do likewise. You focus too much on exterminating Keepers and too little on teaching people how to be better. If I didn&#039;t know better I&#039;d say your only purpose for existence is to be an opponent for the dark gods, and that absent them you wouldn&#039;t care what your followers did with, or to, one another.</p><p class="double">(4) While I understand that the undead are merely constructs of corrupted magic, I am appalled that there are entire races of intelligent beings which you have not only neglected but actively worked to exterminate. Proper light gods do not discriminate based on conditions of birth. Granted that cultural differences would make outreach hazardous for any missionaries you might send to the Underworld, the door should at least remain open for conscientious objectors from the forces of darkness to seek sanctuary with your priests. Your failure to do casts your lightness in a very poor light indeed.</p><p class="double">All of the above complaints stem from the same source: your laissez-faire conduct as regards your world and the followers within it. You don&#039;t provide sufficient backing to seriously challenge the continued creation of Dungeon Hearts, and you don&#039;t teach the kind of lessons that would make Dungeon Hearts less attractive to people. In my opinion you have completely, totally, and utterly failed the people of your world.</p><p class="double">I have spoken with your current Avatar about this over tea and scones, and he agrees with me on most points. It is by his request that I am communicating with you at all. My initial plans were to manufacture my own Castle Hearts (trademark pending) with the aid of the neutral gods, find some peasants, barbarians, and shamen who are sick and tired of all this nonsense, and clean house. If you have not taken action by the full moon after next (thirty days from the writing of this message), I shall proceed with my plans for revolution regardless. I view this not as a pleasure, nor as a path to power and wealth, but as an unpleasant and annoying chore which cannot be put off.</p><p class="double">Kindly respond at your first convenience. I am already reviewing resumes for potential Castle Heart (trademark pending) Keepers.</p><p class="double">Yours most sincerely,</p><p>Twilight Sparkle</p><p>Princess With Portfolio </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.4 (Scygnus)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Well, this is awkward.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Which part? Being human children or being part of the &#039;He-Man Woman Haters Club&#039; and dating me anyway?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All of it. And having this damn squeaky voice again. I thought I was past this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Awww, c&#039;mon Shiny, you&#039;re cute like this! And why haven&#039;t you let me hear this voice before?

With sugar on top?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Evil witch!&quot; Shining Armor grumbled, sighed, and took a deep breath...</p><p class="double">And Cadance carefully didn&#039;t mention seeing Twilight behind him on the bridge with recording equipment. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.5 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I got this, Twilight,&quot; Pinkie said as she walked towards the nightmare version of Luna that appeared for the Summer Sun Celebration instead of Celestia.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait, Pinkie. What are you...&quot; Twilight stopped as she noticed what Pinkie was wearing: some fur dye, a cardboard horn and wings, paper imitation boots like Luna&#039;s, and a folded map for a hat. This was strange, but then again, loops when it was only herself and Pinkie that were awake were usually odd.</p><p class="double">&quot;I know who you are,&quot; Pinkie said, &quot;let me tell every pony. In song form!&quot;</p><p class="double">She pulled out a boombox from her mane, gave herself a beat, and then started rapping,</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m Nightmare Woon!</p><p>Back from the Moon!</p><p>Never grew up with a silver spoon.</p><p>The ponies back then all be dissin&#039; my night.</p><p>My sister and I got in one little fight.</p><p>Mphhghhg!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s hoof suddenly found itself lodged in Pinkie&#039;s mouth. &quot;Let the scary pony give her own introduction, Pinkie.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.6 (OracleMask)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Whatever Celestia had been about to say, it died on her lips as she took in the scene.</p><p class="double">&quot;Princess Celestia! I&#039;d like you meet my new friends,&quot; Twilight Sparkle said, beaming up at her mentor, &quot;And the fellow bearers of the Elements of Harmony, of course.&quot;</p><p class="double">She took a moment to clear her throat.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is Chrysalis, Queen of a race of shape-shifting monsters that replace real ponies in order to feed off the love that pony would normally get from their friends and family. She&#039;s the Element of Honesty.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Charmed,&quot; Chrysalis said with a fangy smile.</p><p class="double">&quot;And these are the Flim Flam brothers, traveling con artists and snake-oil saleponies. Together, they make the Element of Generosity.&quot;</p><p class="double">Both unicorns tipped their hats.</p><p class="double">&quot;And I&#039;m sure you remember King Sombra,&quot; Twilight continued, nodding at the sinister unicorn, &quot;He&#039;s the tyrant who enslaved and tormented the Crystal Ponies, and our Element of Kindness.&quot;</p><p class="double"><b>&quot;Crystals.&quot;</b></p><p class="double">&quot;And this is our Element of Laughter -&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Discord!&quot; Celestia exclaimed, regaining her voice as she took in the sight.</p><p class="double">&quot;What, me? I&#039;m not Discord,&quot; said Discord, &quot;My name is Guy Incognito.&quot;</p><p class="double">Aside from the stylish orange mustache, Discord looked completely the same as ever. Clearly HE was responsible for whatever was going on!</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re not fooling anypony here, <i>Discord</i>,&quot; Celestia growled, stepping forward only to be blocked by Twilight herself.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i>Princess!</i> Don&#039;t be mean to Guy! Besides, I thought you <i>wanted</i> me to make some friends?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;This is...not <i>quite</i> what I had in mind for your friends, Twilight,&quot; Celestia admitted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh...then you may not like meeting my last friend either,&quot; Twilight said, ducking her head and scuffing a hoof on the castle floor, &quot;She&#039;s the Element of Magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight? I would have thought that <i>you</i> would be the Element of Magic,&quot; Celestia said.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no no no! I&#039;m the Element of <i>Loyalty</i>, obviously!&quot; Twilight laughed. &quot;THAT&#039;S our Element of Magic!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;HI BIG SIS!&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia turned, and saw a filly version of Nightmare Moon waving at her.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Is this a good sign or not?&quot; Nyx asked, looking down at the crowd of Canterlot ponies.</p><p class="double">Chrysalis, &#039;Flim&#039; and &#039;Flam&#039; (actually two disguised changelings) and &#039;Sombra&#039; (actually a disguised Luna) shrugged in unison as they kept waving to the cheering ponies below.</p><p class="double">&quot;This might be the fastest I&#039;ve ever been crowned a Princess without ascending first,&quot; Twilight admitted, &quot;Though I suppose &#039;reforming&#039; every single villain around in just one night is pretty impressive when you look at it objectively.&quot;</p><p class="double">&#039;Guy Incognito&#039; simply amused himself with turning random decorations into fish. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.7&nbsp;&nbsp;(Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It was yet another lonely loop, done to near baseline for old time&#039;s sake. Some might think spending three years waiting to try something is a bit much, but it&#039;s hardly out of the norm for Loopers.</p><p class="double">That said, it had taken her a few weeks to set this up. But when the book containing Starswirl&#039;s spell arrived, she was ready. And so, with a good deal of finesse, Twilight cast the incomplete spell.</p><p class="double">When she got up the next morning, she was the only pony in town with her original cutie mark. Just as planned.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Despite Ponyville being even more topsy-turvy then when Discord first came to town, Twilight had managed to get through to her friends, gotten them their marks and memories back, and convinced them she knew how to fix this. As such, they found themselves back in the library, about to cast her modified version of Starswirl&#039;s spell.</p><p class="double">Of course, it wasn&#039;t the baseline corrected version, but something else to go along with her overpowered version of the unfinished one.</p><p class="double">&quot;From all of us together...&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It began in the library. A brilliant multicolored light, seen flashing through the windows. Then it exploded.</p><p class="double">The light swept through Ponyville, expanding until the entire town was engulfed in the tower of rainbow light. As the light cleared, a dazed young dragon sat up in the crater left behind by the library.</p><p class="double">Looking around at the wreckage of the library, the surprisingly untouched town, and the bits of book fluttering down from the sky, Spike could only imagine what Twilight was thinking about all this.</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, that didn&#039;t work. Or it did, too much. Everypony okay?&quot; Spike stood, brushing bits of debris off himself. Nopony answered his question.</p><p class="double">&quot;Guys? Hello? Where did everypony go?&quot; Looking around, Spike found himself alone in the crater, his only company being the miraculously intact bust that had been on the library&#039;s table.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight came to in the starry field she found herself in when she first ascended. Alone, to her disappointment, her plan apparently unsuccessful. With a sigh, she turned to Celestia as she approached, at least she would get a song out of this.</p><p class="double">Then, as Celestia drew breath to speak, Applejack popped in next to her, followed shortly by the rest of her friends. Then other ponies started appearing. The Flower sisters, the spa ponies, the rest of the Apple family, Trixie for some reason, even that weird pony with the jelly obsession.</p><p class="double">Celestia stood there, staring at the entire population of Ponyville, her jaw working, but making not a sound. And then...</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...The loop crashed.&quot; Twilight finished telling her story, in Mac&#039;s bar. &quot;Near as I can tell, having so many ponies ascend at the same time caused that patch of the local astral plane to collapse, and because I didn&#039;t have a physical body when it did...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The loop ended.&quot; Pinkie ended for her. &quot;Nuts, it would have been awesome to see how that would have gone.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.8 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia timed her entrance perfectly, blinking into position in the old castle just as the sun finished cresting over the horizon, and consiquently, was shining in the eyes of those inside watching, masking the shimmer of her spell. Celestia couldn&#039;t help but giggle softly. She had been practicing the timing for that for days!</p><p class="double">Fighting her amusement back, she took a calming breath, and looked up to address her student. &quot;My dearest Twilight! I knew you could-okay what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia merely stood there blinking rapidly for a moment, then fell to her knees, groaned, and face-hoofed. &quot;Okay, how did THIS happen?!&quot; she asked nopony in particular with a sigh.</p><p class="double">&quot;Who.&quot; responded the owl wearing the element of magic before her.</p><p class="double">None of the other necklace wearing animals behind it had an answer either.</p><p class="double">Meanwhile, around the corner, Twilight and her friends were fighting to keep from cracking up. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.9 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke unusually stiff. Attempting to stretch out resulted in the discovery of yet another Weird loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay... so I&#039;m a plant this time. Lavender it looks like.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight? That you?&quot; Rainbow Dash&#039;s voice asked. &quot;I&#039;m over here. I think I&#039;m one of the wildflowers, but I&#039;m not sure which... I might be all of them, come to think of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah take it y&#039;all just Woke Up too? Ah&#039;m above ya.&quot; Applejack sounded in. &quot;Somethin&#039; of a strange feelin&#039; ta BE an apple tree instead a workin&#039; with em.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m here as well darlings! Over here, the bluebells in the grass!&quot; Rarity called.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m here too!&quot; Pinkie giggled. &quot;I think I&#039;m sugarcane! Flutters is next to me. Looks like she&#039;s a shrinking violet.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hi.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed, drooping slightly. &quot;Okay, been through worse. Just need to get our bearings. If where we are counts as Ponyville, then... Applejack, do you see a hill anywhere?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One sec, ah&#039;ll check... yeah, one over yonder. Looks like... a sunflower and a patch a&#039; nightshade on it.&quot;</p><p class="double">All were silent for a moment, until Rarity spoke up.</p><p class="double">&quot;So..... do we swear by horses this loop, or...?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">72.10 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia adjusted her armor, her face set in a grim expression. Twilight had not written about the prophecy... which meant she would not find the Elements. Which meant that when Luna... when Nightmare Moon returned, she would be the only one ready for her. Half a dozen enchantments had been woven into each iron plate, and a full three dozen sang along her halberd.</p><p class="double">Equestria would not fall.</p><p class="double">Not while she still stood.</p><p class="double">&quot;...I am sorry, sister.&quot; The alicorn of the sun saluted the rising moon. &quot;But this must be done.&quot;</p><p class="double">And as the stars converged on the roving pearl, the mare in the moon vanished, and Celestia swung--!</p><p class="double">Luna sidestepped the blow easily, sighing. &quot;Oh, not another one of these loops.&quot; She pulled the seaweed out her mane. &quot;And I had a really good prank ready too!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I will not let you harm our subjects!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Done. No eternal night, I&#039;m not usurping you, yada yada yada.&quot; The younger alicorn shielded herself from another blow, pulling something out of nowhere and lighting it up. &quot;Honestly, I had this whole seas of the moon thing set up and you had to go and ruin it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia grabbed at the object with her magic, intent on crushing it, or containing the explosion. &quot;Don&#039;t try to confuse me! I don&#039;t want this any more then you do!&quot;</p><p class="double">A sigh came from behind her, and she whirled to see Twilight gliding down--twilight with <i>wings?!</i> to a soft landing. &quot;Celestia, she&#039;s sane. She&#039;s not a threat. Put down the big metal stick and we&#039;ll talk.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I--you are an illusion! Conjured up by my crazed sister to--&quot;</p><p class="double">With a roll of her eyes, Twilight lit up her horn. Instantly every rune on Celestia&#039;s armor went dead. &quot;Can&#039;t you accept a little miracle? Fagales, I was so hoping to avoid this and just relax...&quot; She started pulling projection equipment out of nowhere. “I really need to work out how to do this gracefully at some point.”</p><p class="double">Luna sidled up to Celestia, a tub of popcorn in her hoof. &quot;I hear she&#039;s been working on a musical number for this. It should be entertaining.&quot; </p><p class="double"></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>73.1 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;First stop, Sweet Apple Acres.&quot; Spike glanced at the pony next to her. &quot;Any advice from...?&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>If the both of you keep asking for advice, I might stop giving it.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;She&#039;s being snarky again.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Excuse me, I am several hundred... million.... I am your age times the age of the sun at least!

Not anymore.&quot; Twilight rubbed her brow. &quot;So, this Applejack is supposed to be in charge of the food...?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;YEEEEEEEEEEEEHAW!&quot; An orange blur shot past her, zipping toward one of the fruit laden trees. At the last instant she spun around and kicked out her hind legs; every single apple fell into a basket.</p><p class="double">&quot;Is that her?&quot; Twilight whispered.</p><p class="double"><i>Yes, that&#039;s Applejack. Now remember, be as honest with her as you can.</i></p><p class="double">The farm pony trotted up. &quot;Well, howdy stranger. What&#039;s yer name?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh. Well, I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle and--&quot;</p><p class="double">Without warning her hoof was vibrating up and down. &quot;A pleasure ta meet ya miss Twilight!

I was sent by Celestia to check on the food for the celebration!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Awwww, no mention of me?</i></p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t want to sound crazy!</i></p><p class="double">Oblivious to the unicorn&#039;s internal dialogue, Applejack trotted up to a triangle and began ringing it loudly. &quot;SOOOOOOOOOUP&#039;S ON, EVERYPONY!&quot; Twilight stared as ponies of every color swarmed the barn. The cowpony turned to her with a chuckle. &quot;Now why don&#039;t Ah introduce you to the Apple family?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, Ihmph would love to meet them all!&quot;</p><p class="double">Applejack rose an eyebrow at Twilight&#039;s odd twitch. &quot;Ooooooookay... Um.&quot; Dismissing the oddity with a shake of her head, she gestures toward the ponies to start piling food on a convenient table. This here&#039;s Apple Fritter. Apple Bumpkin. Red Gala. Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp...&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;Big Macintosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Am I expected to EAT all that?</i></p><p class="double"><i>The food, no. The ponies, yes.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;What?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Strike that, reverse it.</i></p><p class="double">Twilight belatedly realized the odd looks she was receiving. &quot;...a lovely arrangement of foodstuffs you have here! Yep, it looks handled.&quot; <i>Vespertine that was not funny!</i></p><p class="double"><i>You know, there are some odd loops where Celestia has a blood sacrifice to her every year?</i></p><p class="double">&quot;You okay sugarcube?&quot; Applejack examined her face. &quot;You look a bit pale.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I&#039;m fine!&quot; Twilight said, and then &quot;Just super hungry!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Stop doing that! I thought you wanted to save the world!</i></p><p class="double"><i>Don&#039;t worry, we will. But we can&#039;t very well do that on an empty stomach!</i> </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight groaned as her overloaded stomach tugged at her ribcage. &quot;I hate you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike jumped. &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, not <i>you.</i> Vespertine.&quot; Twilight shook her head. &quot;You, Spike, are an amazing incredible dragon and I wouldn&#039;t be where I was without you. Vespertine, on the other hoof, is an old malicious hag.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Alright, alright. I&#039;m sorry for all the snark.

It didn&#039;t help that Vespertine chose that exact moment to start singing some high-pitched tune in meows alone. When, at last, the world decided to go back to normalcy, she was plunked into a mud puddle and then, for no reason, something else dropped on top of her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wha.... what hit me?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Heh, whoops.&quot; The weight on her lifted and moved into her view. &quot;Sorry bout that. Name&#039;s Rainbow Dash.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Twilight, I don&#039;t have time to explain but it is absolutely imperative you kiss her NOW.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Wait what?!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Lip to lip!</i></p><p class="double">Spike faceclawed. &quot;Oh no...&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Don&#039;t use tongue!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Uh...

Um--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, wait! I&#039;m sorry, I just... there&#039;s this... and...&quot; Twilight sat in her mud puddle. &quot;I was confused. You reminded me of somepony--&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Cloud Kicker,</i> Vespertine helpfully supplied.</p><p class="double">&quot;--named Cloud Kicker, and--&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash held up a hoof. &quot;Say no more, Kicker&#039;s crazy. You must not be from around here.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, I... I&#039;m here to oversee the summer sun celebration preparations. Celestia sent me!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>Remember, Rainbow Dash is the element of Loyalty, so you have to be really loyal to her.</i></p><p class="double"><i>Is that why you wanted me to kiss her?</i></p><p class="double"><i>...sure, let&#039;s go with that.</i></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;d reeeeally like to see what you&#039;re doing here.&quot; The muddy unicorn sidled up in a horrible attempt to look attractive. &quot;I&#039;m sure it&#039;s amazing.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uh... heh, um. I&#039;m just, uh, clearing the clouds.&quot; Rainbow leaned away slightly. &quot;You know.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;All these clouds? In the sky?&quot; Twilight flittered her eyelids. &quot;Fascinating.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>You do realize I was kidding about the kissing thing, right?</i></p><p class="double"><i>...well horseapples. Now I look like an insane fanfilly.</i></p><p class="double">Rainbow cocked her head. &quot;You... really don&#039;t get out much do you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes. Yes, that is the total explanation.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oooookay then. So, uh... you want me to clear the clouds?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just do that real fast and we can all pretend this never happened.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Trixie grumbled into her drink. &quot;...pid nettling sunbutt and her stupid politics. Going to stage a coup...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I forget this happens sometimes,&quot; Twilight admitted with a light blush. &quot;Sorry, I... I should have warned you.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;C4 all around the base of Canterlot... mass teleport circle, get all the civvies to, I dunno, Manehattan...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s not like either of them are awake. You can&#039;t really blame them for this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But not Celly, oooooh no.&quot; Trixie drowned her drink. &quot;Celly&#039;s going to stay in the city when Curtain Call sends it plummeting! Exclusion gem on her crown, or... or something! Hah!&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity trotted in. &quot;I came as soon as I heard.... oh dear. She&#039;s taking it bad, isn&#039;t she.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and shrugged. &quot;She wants to go nightmare and blow up Canterlot.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, dear. There there, Trixie, tell me all about it.&quot;</p><p class="double">And suddenly the blue unicorn burst into tears. &quot;WHY?! WHY?! I know it&#039;s not really Chrysalis but WHY?!?!

I just don&#039;t know.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.4 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...Rarity, why are you wearing a live horseshoe crab on your head?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s a fashion statement!&quot; The ivory unicorn braided some of her mane around the crustacean&#039;s long tail. &quot;I intend to start a cultural revolution, centered on the odd and unusual. There&#039;s a full line of deep-sea hats and matching gowns--&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You&#039;re just bored because Spike isn&#039;t Awake aren&#039;t you.&quot;</p><p class="double">Rarity sighed. &quot;I admit that&#039;s a part of it. Come now, Twilight, you can&#039;t tell me you haven&#039;t ever indulged in oddity on one of your lonely loops?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight smiled and shook her head. &quot;Alright, fair enough. You can have this one.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.5 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Welp.&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie glared at Twilight. &quot;We will never speak of this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, I&#039;ve been all the Elements.

Of this loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And it&#039;s not laughter, really, it&#039;s more... optimism, when you think of it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;NEVER SPEAK OF – wait, really?&quot; Trixie tapped her chin. &quot;Optimism. Yeah, okay, I could see that.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot; Twilight glanced around. &quot;I&#039;m honestly more surprised the Elements ended up in Manehattan. Still, we&#039;ve got an interesting collection of Bearers this time round. Wonder what Rainbow will think of Daring holding her position.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you think I could carry two elements through the loops?&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;Tried it. They all seem to fall back to your basic element. You&#039;re... showy optimistic magic. Somehow.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.6 (Namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, Rarity?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How did you turn Gilda into an Griffin-Alicorn hybrid?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s one of those things that sounds good after saying &#039;Hold my beer and watch this.&#039;&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.7 (RedshirtZombie)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Dear Princess:</p><p class="double">Send help. Twilight&#039;s made some sort of lab in the Everfree and has a stormcloud over it. I think I heard the kind of laughing that leads to Miss Smartypants incidents.</p><p class="double">-Spike</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was bedecked in a traditional mad scientist&#039;s coat and goggles, standing on her hind hooves to grip the open knife switch - despite the fact that she had a perfectly serviceable horn - and, appropriately, laughing in the fashion that lead to Stern Reprisals later on. </p><p class="double">Her fellow Mad Scientist interrupted her laughter with a brief attention-claiming cough. &quot;I don&#039;t get why you&#039;re so insistent on the whole &#039;mad scientist&#039; getup. You&#039;ve got the whole subspace laboratory under Golden Oaks, which has better research facilities, and -&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Because it&#039;s funny,&quot; responded Twilight, &quot;and this is the kind of thing that Pinchy shouldn&#039;t be near. Besides, this isn&#039;t so much furthering our knowledge of your Cutie mark focus as creating an abomination related to it, so it&#039;s more mad science than regular science.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...Fair enough,&quot; responded Berry Punch. &quot;In any case, the still&#039;s has been filled properly and is at temp, and the capacitors are all over ninety percent charged. About the only thing that isn&#039;t working is the Jacob&#039;s ladder, and you said that was because Dash had messed with it.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah, good!&quot; Twilight started to tug the switch to its closed position, but stopped. &quot;Uh, no, I meant,&quot; she shifted back to her &#039;Sparky&#039; face, &quot;EXCELLENT!&quot; With a final deep, evil laugh, she slammed the switch closed.</p><p class="double">Thunder crackled above, and lightning slammed into exposed electrodes as the cyclotron began humming. Fluid, saturated with various mixtures not meant for casual equine consumption, hummed through it; however, specific alterations in the machine ensured that the fluids stopped obeying Euclidean understandings of space and promptly folded inwards on itself, darkening abruptly as it collected. The two Mad Scientists-in-role waited, tense as strained rope, as their efforts slowly formed...</p><p class="double">Eventually, the final charge in the capacitors ran out, and the collection keg - at Berry&#039;s insistence - was filled with the resulting distillation. Carefully, Twilight levitated a Dwarven stein over to Berry, and let her handle the tap. The fluid that came out fluoresced green like a glowstick, held an impressive head despite expert taphandling, and bubbled as it attempted to decay back to conventional physics. </p><p class="double">Berry took a whiff, winced, and nodded. &quot;I think step one was a success.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>WHAT, THEREFORE, WAS STEP TWO?</b>&quot; called the Traditional Royal Canterlot voice from behind them. Fortunately for the floor, not a drop spilled despite the spook. </p><p class="double">&quot;Try it!&quot; Twilight&#039;s smile was of someone who had succeeded at breaking a barrier they thought untouchable, not of someone embarrassed by being caught with their hand in the wrong cookie jar. Luna promptly found herself sitting in front of a table, the aforementioned stein in front of her, a (admittedly nice) cushion under her seated form, and two faces watching closely from the other side of the table.</p><p class="double">&quot;First, tell me what this... luminous liquid... is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, ever since your return, I&#039;ve been researching snippets of older history. One in particular, a song about a certain kind of liquor, caught my attention, and so I enlisted the assistance of Berry Punch here, the town cellarmeister and main bartender at Big Macintosh&#039;s Apple Cellar, to see if we could recreate the drink in question. We just needed someone to try it - and your timing is perfect!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Then what, pray tell, is the machinery attached to the keg for?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I can&#039;t cast that Starswirl the Bearded time travel spell again. So I had to find some other means of properly affecting the liquor in question.&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna stared, quietly, at the facetious foal across the table from her, then the frothing foam in front of her for a moment, sighed, and took a sip. A glowing green mustache sat on her upper lip for a moment before she licked it off. &quot;Heavy, like few drinks are these days. What was the name of this brew you sought to replicate?&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry smiled sweetly as she said, &quot;<u>Three-oh-seven ale.</u>&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I recall not a ballad involving this brew... but many things from then are forgotten to me, so I will let it be.&quot; With that, she chugged the rest of the drink. &quot;Another?&quot;</p><p class="double">Two hooves bumped hard, and another glass was served. Luna nodded at the mad scientists as she continued drinking. &quot;It&#039;s a fine brew, not my usual draft, but it will suffice. In any case, I would suggest letting me take it back to Canterlot to soothe my sister&#039;s nerves... your assistant sent a letter of warning, and I suspect she would find that its fruit, being something this benign, will calm her concerns.&quot; With that, she stood.</p><p class="double">Or tried to, as she found herself abruptly prone, with her limbs tangled. &quot;Also, a helping hoof to my chariot? My coordination hath vanished, and my vision room is doubled.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.8 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;...and that&#039;s what&#039;s going on,&quot; Nyx finished. &quot;Any questions?&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna stared at the filly who had, until thirty minutes ago, been her nearly bloodthirsty alter ego. Her mouth opened. Her mouth shut. Her mouth opened again.</p><p class="double">Nyx patted her shoulder warmly. &quot;Don&#039;t worry. Just take your time, it&#039;s a lot to take in.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If... if what thou... you... say is true, then... How have you not gone more insane than before?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a long story involving my adopted mother and a cult. But my primary coping method is ice cream.&quot; Nyx pulled a tub of something out of nowhere, handing it to Luna while she got another tub out for herself. &quot;Now, I had this great idea for a prank, but I don&#039;t want to step on your hooves....&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.9 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash, your element is oxygen. Applejack, you&#039;re solid and dependable like nitrogen,&quot; Applejack&#039;s comment on how Nitrogen is neither solid nor dependable nor has much to do with apples was completely ignored as Twilight Sparkle kept on talking, &quot;Rarity, you&#039;re carbon since that&#039;s what diamonds are made of.&quot; </p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight, dear,&quot; Rarity spoke up. Every pony was looking at the lavender unicorn as if she had just grown a second head, even Nightmare Moon, &quot;Are you certain that these are the proper kinds of elements in the elements of harmony?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m certain. Fairly sure, at least. Mostly,&quot; Twilight shrugged before continuing, &quot;Fluttershy, you are lithium.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um..&quot; was all the yellow pegasus managed to get out before Pinkie Pie interrupted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh! Can I be nitrous oxide! Or one of the high level elements with the silly names? Wait, is pinkium an element? I want to be that one if it is!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No. Nitrous oxide is a molecule. Your element, Pinkie, is helium,&quot; Twilight stated, &quot;And I am neon.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;More like boron,&quot; Rainbow muttered loudly under her breath.</p><p class="double">Twilight continued in her best impersonation of Prince Blueblood, pretending she hadn&#039;t heard her friend&#039;s comment, &quot;And as the noble gas, I shall help all the others come together to form the periodic elements of harmony and why are you laughing? Stop laughing. I&#039;m a noble gas. That&#039;s not funny in the least.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash were rolling on the floor. Even Fluttershy had a hoof to her mouth to contain her silent snickering. </p><p class="double">Rarity walked up to Twilight, &quot;Perhaps you can just summon the actual elements and we can close the cover on this attempt?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Fine. Ruin my fun, &quot; Twilight huffed as she summoned the baseline elements, &quot;You all can be sulfur, because you all stink.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.10 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Twilight&#039;s eye twitched. &quot;So wait a second. Your power, the one I have been going mad since BASELINE to figure out, the one you specifically told me you couldn&#039;t explain, works on the understanding of a hyper-quantum equation that focuses the fourth dimension into a single point in actual space, that you decided on a whim to put in your own brain?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned and nodded. &quot;Yep, that&#039;s about the extent of it. I said I couldn&#039;t explain because I really couldn&#039;t. At the time, you just plain weren&#039;t <i>smart</i> enough to understand me if I did.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;But... but that&#039;s... not SMART enough?! But then... that would mean you... gravity... twitchy tail... cupcake song... hot sauce... bees... but... fortune teller... flowerpots... I&#039;M the time traveler... but... AAARRRGH!&quot;</p><p class="double">And her head exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>73.11 (masterofgames)</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke reading the usual book under her usual tree on her usual day.</p><p class="double">&quot;But she... there&#039;s no way... the brainpower it would take... PINKIE of all ponies?! What makes her... how does she... rock farm... how Equestria was made... rainboom... party addiction... but she... I... AAARRRGH!&quot;</p><p class="double">And her head exploded. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.12 (misterq)</p><p class="double">A few calming cups of tea later, Twilight decided to try and get some clarification.</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay then, Pinkie. Explain to a pony only as smart as myself how a fourth dimensional hyper-quantum equation let&#039;s you have Pinkie Sense.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well,&quot; Pinkie took a deep breath while she gathered her thoughts for a moment, &quot;combined with the thaumic properties of being the element of laughter, it lets my brain&#039;s neural signals travel at faster than light speeds where cause and effect are reversed for a few seconds and are interpreted by a variety of external stimuli. Thus, twitchy tail.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared, &quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">Then a book fell onto her head.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twitchy tail,&quot; Pinkie Pie reiterated, &quot;Twitcha-twitch.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight looked up at a sheepish Spike carrying a far too large far too unbalanced stack of books on the second floor of library. She took the offending book off her head and placed it on a nearby table, &quot;FTL thoughts? But that would mean..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That I&#039;m totally incompatible with all kinds of telepathy, psionic powers, and neural interfaces. Yup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you can also..&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;End every pony&#039;s sentences in a super duper annoying way whenever I want. Yup.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stared at her looping pink friend. Then she opened her mouth.</p><p class="double">&quot;Blather lather,&quot; both ponies said at the same time, &quot;Bookie cookie.&quot;</p><p class="double">Both ponies closed their mouths and stared at each other again.</p><p class="double">Twilight spoke first, &quot;Pinkie, never do that again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, Twilight,&quot; the pink pony agreed. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.13 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight looked at the ticket. <i>One adult membership- OrockuCon 1004, Baltimare. </i>No, staring at the words didn&#039;t make them change and go away, holly take it.</p><p class="double">&quot;Isn&#039;t it wonderful?&quot; Pinkie Pie enthused. &quot;Maud got one for everypony! Oh, you&#039;re going to love meeting her! She&#039;s the funnest and coolest big sister EVER!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um... Pinkie...&quot; Rainbow Dash&#039;s expression matched Twilight&#039;s. &quot;You never told us your sister was... one of them.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;One of what?&quot; Pinkie chirped.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know...&quot; Rainbow Dash&#039;s hooves waved awkwardly, trying to shape the words in as kind a way as possible. &quot;One of those... um... really... um...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Really cool and wonderful and exciting ponies?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, well, er...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What Rainbow Dash is trying to say, darling,&quot; Rarity butted in, &quot;is that OrackuCon is an event for, how shall I put this, some rather obsessive and slightly creepy ponies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Applejack added. &quot;They get all up in your face about how wonderful pebbles are, and how basalt or granite or limestone is Best Rock Ever.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Precisely,&quot; Rarity agreed. &quot;We didn&#039;t know your sister was one of those... <i>rock hounds.</i>&quot; The last two words dripped with disgust.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shot a look at Twilight, who held up her hooves in preemptive surrender. &quot;I&#039;m looking forward to meeting your sister,&quot; she said. <i>And seeing what she&#039;s like in this changed baseline.</i> Everything had been predictable right up until this moment.</p><p class="double">Pinkie didn&#039;t look away. &quot;Twilight,&quot; she said, &quot;remember when you took me to that exhibit about Starswirl the Bearded&#039;s favorite quill pens?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Er... yes?&quot; That had been a few weeks before, part of the lead-up to the big Starswirl traveling show she&#039;d taken Cadance to.</p><p class="double">Having made her point, Pinkie glanced up at Rainbow Dash. &quot;And Dashie, remember when you took us all to the Wonderbolts show and kept telling us all about the lives of every single current Wonderbolt team member?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah?&quot;</p><p class="double">Now Pinkie&#039;s stare turned on Applejack. &quot;And remember when you had us all on ladders last Spring with little paintbrushes because you wanted to try to get seeds for new hybrid apples? And you told us all about the different ponies who created new and yummy apple varieties?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Shore I do,&quot; Applejack said, &quot;but what&#039;s that got to do with-&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And Rarity,&quot; Pinkie interrupted, &quot;remember the Manehattan Museum of Historical Fashions? Especially the Steedpunk exhibit?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Weren&#039;t the saddles and corsets exquisite?&quot; Rarity gushed.</p><p class="double">&quot;And Fluttershy...&quot; Pinkie leaned down at the pink-maned pegasus, who had already put her head under her hooves in anticipation. <i>&quot;Breezies,&quot;</i> she whispered loud enough for all to hear. Fluttershy flinched.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, so what?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked. &quot;You had fun at all of that stuff! And it&#039;s not like being a Wonderbolts fan is the same as being a rock hound!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight stepped forward- time to defuse this. &quot;I think it is, Dash,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;What&#039;s Pinkie&#039;s pointing out is that each of us- probably everypony- has something we really, really love and want to share with others. And sometimes we don&#039;t appreciate or enjoy that thing the same way they do. But that doesn&#039;t make them worse ponies, just because they love something we don&#039;t.&quot;</p><p class="double">She stepped over to Pinkie and put a hoof on the earth pony&#039;s shoulder. &quot;And we owe it to those ponies to at least give them the benefit of the doubt- and to not judge them based on what they love.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie beamed at Twilight, as the other four ponies hung their heads, ears flat, eyes down. &quot;You&#039;re quite right,&quot; Rarity said at length. &quot;Pinkie, I&#039;m ever so sorry. I&#039;ll be honored to go to OrockuCon with your sister.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; Applejack said. &quot;If you&#039;ll still have us, that is.&quot;</p><p class="double">Judging by the crushing hug she administered to the other five ponies, Pinkie would.</p><p class="double">As Twilight led the group towards the train station, she heard Pinkie ask Rarity, &quot;Anyway, I thought you LIKED rocks! You have that handy-dandy rock-finding spell! You use rocks in your fashions all the time!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, no, no, no, Pinkie,&quot; Rarity giggled. &quot;Those aren&#039;t rocks. They&#039;re GEMS. Com-PLETE-ly different.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, not even trying to figure out the logic in that. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.14 (Namar13766)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight blinked as she took in the sight of the Tale of the Two Sisters. A flood of emotions came to the surface as she recalled the last moments of the preceding loop.</p><p class="double">&quot;Twilight? Are you OK?,&quot; came the voice of a worried and Awake Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah.&quot; A bittersweet smile appeared as she closed her teary eyes and rested her head on the pages of the book. &quot;Side-by-side with a friend is a good way to finish a loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Big Macintosh looked up from arranging his bottles as a melancholy looking Twilight Sparkle entered his bar followed by a concerned looking Spike. She looked at the green drink Mac slid in front of her with a blank expression, followed by Spike picking up his Zap Pineapple Vodka.</p><p class="double">&quot;Look Twilight, I understand you don&#039;t want to tell the others now since they&#039;re not Awake, but... can you at least tell me now so you can do it better later?&quot;</p><p class="double">The prognosticating purple pony simply swirled the drink for a while, before setting it down and sighing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Last loop, I awoke in my childhood. I wasn&#039;t going to change anything, and I was just going to take a vacation, But then I noticed something. I saw Sunset Shimmer brush off a group of ponies that wanted to be her friends, saying that she didn&#039;t have time for friends.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s funny, now that I think about it,&quot; said Twilight as she waved her hoof. &quot;I&#039;d looped back further so many times, so I&#039;d seen this happen so many times before, in the background so the speak, but this was the first time I had actually noticed it happening. I finally decided that even if I was just noticing for the first time, I would do something to change her fate. It would have been wrong for me to just let her go down the path she did in the baseline.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;How&#039;d you pull that off?&quot;, asked Spike with a sip of his drink.</p><p class="double">&quot;So basically, I just showed up now and then to pester her when she&#039;s trying to read, and somehow convincing her to teach me, thus turning me into Celestia&#039;s most faithful student-by-proxy. After all, they do say you can learn more by teaching than by studying. Besides, after hearing about Sunset in detail from Celestia, I was kind of curious about her side of the story.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So what was her explanation?&quot; asked Macintosh.</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed. &quot;You know how neurotic I could be with Celestia&#039;s trickster mentor tendencies in the baseline? Combine that with the fact she was an orphan and saw Celestia more like a mother than <i>I</i> did...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh boy.&quot; Spike and Macintosh simultaneously drew out.</p><p class="double">&quot;Instead of catastrophizing like I did because she didn&#039;t get the power she wanted fast enough, she was more angry at it instead, and thought she was being held back unfairly. Plus, considering how she wasn&#039;t told about Luna like I was, meant that she wanted to get the power by any means necessary.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did you know she didn&#039;t actually have a plan on what to do after becoming a princess? She figured that once she actually became a princess, she&#039;d have plenty of opportunities to figure it out. I got both of them to talk with each other, and even if she couldn&#039;t reconcile completely, Sunset still rebuilt some the respect she had for Celestia.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;So how&#039;d the rest of the loop turn out?&quot; Big Mac asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t think the rest of the loop was that important compared to how it ended,&quot; interjected Spike.</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know if she knew the loop was going to end that day somehow, but-&quot; Twilight let out a shuddering exhalation of breath. &quot;She told me that looking back, she noticed that I was making her a better pony than she would have been otherwise, and asked me why.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I don&#039;t know why I told her after what happened with Flash and Fleur, but I couldn&#039;t lie to her about my being a looper.&quot; A brittle smile graced her face. &quot;Yet somehow that doesn&#039;t stop me from lying about <i>her</i> being a looper, the things we got up to together, and telling her that I&#039;m looking forward to seeing her again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We just had some time laughing about what happened in the baseline, with the fact she shouldn&#039;t have known about the Elements when she came through, the hilarity of the fact I didn&#039;t actually go to classes the first time around, and the stupidity of using brainwashed, zombified teenagers to conquer Equestria.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know the last thing she said to me? She said that even if she doesn&#039;t remember this particular loop because she wasn&#039;t awake, I have been, and always shall be your friend, and that being there at the end, side-by-side with a friend was a good way for her to enjoy it.&quot;</p><p class="double">Spike laid a comforting claw on Twilight as she gave out a shuddering sob into the hardwood bar.</p><p class="double">&quot;I woke up looking up the legend of Nightmare Moon like I normally do. It&#039;s sad, because now it means that I don&#039;t have the chance to stop Sunset from throwing her life away.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.15 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Apple Family Reunion was interrupted by a purple unicorn running through the crowd, heading straight for Big Macintosh.</p><p class="double">&quot;BIG MAC!&quot; She shouted. &quot;Emergency abort 34-beta!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eeee-&quot; He began, but just as the unicorn reached him, he set his stance, cracked the ground under him, and launched the mare into the sky with a vaulting throw. &quot;-<i><b>YUUUUUUUUUUP!</b></i><i>&quot;</i></p><p class="double">As the mare disappeared into the distance, the rest of the Apple clan looked on horrified. By this time though, Big Mac had returned to his normal manner, acting as if nothing odd had just occurred.</p><p class="double">&quot;Bi-bu-wha...&quot; Applejack tried, failing to formulate words until she slapped herself. &quot;What in tarnation&#039;d you just do?&quot;</p><p class="double">He shrugged. &quot;Any sort of gibberish endin&#039; in &#039;beta&#039; means &#039;throw me at the moon&#039;. With that arc she should get there in about... three minutes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That dun&#039;t explain <i>nuthin&#039;!&quot;</i> The farmmare rebuked.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wasn&#039;t s&#039;possed to. Ya need a drink, &#039;jack? Got some o&#039; the <i>strong</i> cider in the kitchen if&#039;n ya need it.&quot; He offered.</p><p class="double">At this point she could barely do more than nod.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight wasn&#039;t sure what ascending- or using any sort of magic at all, really- on Equestria would do while she was stuck with whatever cosmic equivalent of bad poison joke with an infusion of love poison was stuck on her. That said, she was now an alicorn princess carving calculations for runic dispersal matrices into a large slab of lunar rock. The grating noise as she dragged a spike of metal along it barely phased her, concentrating as she was.</p><p class="double">&quot;Do you <i>mind</i>?&quot; Nightmare Moon hissed, busy as she carvedout her own plans for her upcoming return on a nearby slab.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes actually, I <i>do</i>.&quot; Twilight shot back. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.16 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><i>997, Moonless Age. 996th year of The Exodus.</i></p><p>Across the system from Equestria and the world is sits upon, there exists a small gaseous planet. While the planet itself has too hostile an atmosphere to be of interest itself, it does however boast a habitable moon, named Hearth by its colonists. Amongst other things, Hearth is most notable for being home to the Coalition&#039;s first open-air farms and gardens. All other farming, both on the Moon and its other colonies, were all carefully controlled hydroponics facilities.</p><p class="double">The Moon itself held station some two hundred thousand miles distant from Hearth. It looked a good deal different than it did when Equestria last saw it. The great engine arrays, a massive cross of metal wrapped around a third its surface. Docking towers rose up from the top and bottom, like giant dorsal fins, lit up by running lights. At the bow sat a third tower, the Prow.</p><p class="double">The Prow was a towering spike of metal, housing a massive spell array. When in motion, this array is powered by groups of mages, and at times the Captain herself, to project a shield in front of the Moon. With this shield protecting it from debris, the Moon can sail through space without fear. Given the importance of the Prow, and the presence of the Bridge beneath it, it is of little surprise that the area surrounding the Prow&#039;s base is the Moon&#039;s primary military district.</p><p class="double">Towards the edge of this district is a pub, the Mare Nectaris, and it is there that we find our exasperated Captain.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A well known bicorn hit the bartop with a soft thump, followed by a more meaty thud as an equally well known head landed beside it. &quot;Oh Captain, my Captain!&quot; The barkeep pretended to swoon at her. &quot;You know ponies usually get drunk before faceplanting, right?&quot; Finding Berry Punch aboard the Moon was a surprise, more-so when she Woke up the year before. &quot;Things that bad over yonder?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s fine! It&#039;s fine! Everything&#039;s fine! Nopony <i>died!</i> Everything&#039;s <i>fine</i>, and nopony died.&quot; As a Ponyville veteran, Berry had to rate Luna&#039;s wide-eyed smile as an six point two on the Smarty Pants Scale.</p><p class="double">&quot;That bad, eh? Care to elaborate? We&#039;ve mostly only heard about the collapse itself.&quot; Berry asked, as she mixed Luna a drink.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know why Hearth&#039;s local government wanted the mines? To be more independent of the Orion&#039;s Belt Mining Initiative?&quot; Luna gave a forlorn look at her suddenly empty glass, before Berry refilled it. &quot;Well, it turns out they bribed the geologists, and covered up how they were told certain areas were unsafe to mine. And now they&#039;re in hot water, there&#039;s a forced review being done on <i>all</i> the mines, the Moon&#039;s intended departure date is being pushed back by weeks, and I&#039;m going to be late for Yamato&#039;s first launch.&quot; Having somehow reached her third glass while she was talking, Luna chose pay more attention to her consumption rate.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now now, Yamato isn&#039;t launching for another two months, and you can just hop on a ship if the Moon is still in transit. I know you want to have the Moon swing by the asteroid colonies before we go home, but it doesn&#039;t need to be there for Yamato. Has there been any new resistance to moving the Moon back in-system?&quot; Berry once again found herself refilling Luna&#039;s glass.</p><p class="double">&quot;Less, actually, since we went public with the Navy&#039;s expansion. Your advice was on the mark, as far as that was concerned. Barring any other great disasters, we&#039;re still on track for next year&#039;s departure.&quot; With that, Luna drained her glass once more. &quot;Now, enough with the liquid appetizers! Doth thou have any Ryncol left?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Several months later, Twilight found herself listening to her friend reading a local Canterlot newspaper.</p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;I&#039;m not saying it was Moonponies,&#039; Claims Professor Night Light, a radio-astrologist with the Royal Astrology Association, &#039;but it was probably Moonponies.&#039; Blah blah. &#039;The real mystery is why this signal was strong enough to make out, while none of their others were. And, of course, where they learned Neighponese, and what this Iskandar place is.&#039; Isn&#039;t this wonderful, everypony? Our first clear signals from the Moonponies, and Twilight&#039;s father got in the paper!&quot; Fleur gushed.</p><p class="double">The basement door opened, allowing a blue mare to enter the room. &quot;Hi girls, sorry I&#039;m late.&quot; Minuette greeted them. &quot;Lyra can&#039;t make it tonight, and Moondancer still hasn&#039;t changed her mind about the Cult.&quot;</p><p class="double">Even years later, Twilight was still surprised at how quickly she had found herself in a Moon Cult, after she had tried making friends. &quot;Well,&quot; She said, drawing the attention of the others, &quot;If that&#039;s everypony for tonight, shall we get started?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, lets.&quot; The most shocking Moon Cultist ever replied. &quot;Let us start by giving thanks.&quot; Cadance began, &quot;To Princess Luna who wanders the stars, to Princess Celestia who watches over us in her absence, and to Twilight&#039;s mother for putting up with us stealing her basement every week.&quot;</p><p class="double">As was now their tradition, they all shouted &quot;Thanks Mom!&quot; up the stairs.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now, let&#039;s get started! Minuette, if you would please start cutting pizza? I&#039;m hungry. Fleur, while we wait, any other news since last week?&quot; With that, the small cult descended into their weekly meeting, talking about space, ponies, and sometimes even spaceponies. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.17 (TheCentauress)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight came running up, her tail encrusted with dark crystals and her horn sputtering. &quot;Pinkie! Plan 47-bobsled-32-Hike!&quot;</p><p class="double">The Pink Party Pony stood on her rear hooves and did a credible salute. Then, in a maneuver that defied logic, common sense and several laws of physics, she had stuffed a pan of her &#039;special&#039; Torobasco-cupcakes into the librarian-cum-sentai leader&#039;s mouth, stuffed the soul headfirst into her party cannon and fired the result at the hovering malicious foggy dictator.</p><p class="double">As everyone watched the ballistic unicorn mage, spewing a combined stream of fire and propulsive magic slam through the semi-corporal evil stallion and cook away his physical manifestation, Rarity turned to Pinkie. &quot;Was that one of Twilight&#039;s &#039;contingency&#039; plans, dear?&quot; she asked in a low voice.</p><p class="double">The Element of Laughter shrugged. &quot;No idea, &quot; she responded blithely. &quot;It worked, though.&quot;</p><p class="double">Two days later, a relatively normal Twilight stumbled back into the borders of the Crystal Empire. Well, relatively normal - barring the cloud of steam that wafted from her hide and the sluicy river of melt-water that followed her across the weather-shield border. &quot;That mare needs to <i>read</i> the packets I send her,&quot; she growled under her breath, wisps of smoke seeping from between her teeth. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.18 (masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Cheerilee sighed, kicking at a pebble. &quot;I dunno, Berry, it&#039;s just... I kind of feel like there&#039;s no niche for me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Berry patted her sister&#039;s shoulder. &quot;We both know that isn&#039;t true. You&#039;re a great teacher and a warm-hearted mare.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And I think that&#039;s the point. I have to teach, but I don&#039;t have nearly as much... to teach.&quot; Cheerilee looked to the sky. &quot;Maybe that&#039;s why I&#039;m looping out of Equestria so often... so I end up with new loopers, or... something.&quot;</p><p class="double">Her sister looked at her for a long, hard moment.</p><p class="double">&quot;...teach me.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Come on, we both know I was boozed up all through school. I might be clean now, kind of... mostly... but I&#039;ve been focusing on my brewing skills and raising Ruby...&quot; Berry shook her head. &quot;I haven&#039;t had time to catch up on everything. Most of what I know is just scraps I pick up from the bar. I can&#039;t fly a plane or make a spell or... whatever everyone else does. Without a tumbler, I&#039;m nothing. So teach me.&quot;</p><p class="double">Cheerilee shook her head. &quot;Berry, you&#039;re not nothing. You&#039;re a mother. You&#039;re my sister – well, often. You are a great pony.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Who doesn&#039;t know squat. You in or not?&quot;</p><p class="double">That got a snort. &quot;Okay, okay. Let me figure out something... and... thanks.&quot; Cherrilee smiled. &quot;For making me feel useful again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Anytime, sis. Anytime.&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.19 (Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Wow, you were right,&quot; Cheese Sandwich sighed as he lay flopped forward in the sauna. &quot;This is just the thing to relax and rest the old party muscles.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eyup,&quot; Big Mac nodded from his bench.</p><p class="double">Yes, the spa was a really expensive way to work up the kind of sweat he could have by an afternoon of applebucking, but it was worth it to ease Cheese Sandwich into Ponyville rather than his usual baseline storm-and-conquer musical number entrance.</p><p class="double">&quot;You think Pinkie Pie will be interested in my ideas for Miss Dash&#039;s birthiversary party?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I hope she likes the hippo.

Or the balloon animals that can tie balloons to make even more balloon animals? Will she think that&#039;s cool? Or will she think it&#039;s really stupid? I gotta know! I gotta-&quot;</p><p class="double">Big Mac chose that moment to pour a bit more water on the coals. Steam hissed into the air, stopping Cheese Sandwich&#039;s anxiety attack in progress.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, right,&quot; Cheese Sandwich said, subsiding back onto the bench. &quot;I&#039;m in here to relax. No sense in getting uptight again.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe I should talk to Pinkie Pie and ask.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Eyup.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You know, Big Mac,&quot; Cheese said, &quot;it&#039;s so nice to talk to a pony who really understands me.&quot;</p><p class="double">In Big Mac&#039;s view silence was almost always a virtue, but sometimes more so than others. Instead of speaking he poured a bit more water on the coals and adjusted himself into the most relaxing spot on the bench. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.20 (Detective Ethan Redfield)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"><b>Looper Convention Part 2</b></p><p class="double">Shortly after introducing himself and the Elder Tale Loops to the Sonic loopers, the enchanter began planning for the changes in the loop. While he thought, the looping guild members departed for the central room of the guild hall, where big guilds could hold meetings at a price. 300 gold for the day, but it was well worth it as it could accommodate his purposes quite easily. A quick call to Twilight, and the three guilds were now all gathered.</p><p>Nyanta was there as well, having traveled to Akiba by the city gate, and awake as he spoke with another werecat looper by the name Blaze. Naotsugu was also there, getting to know if Sonic was an open or closed pervert. Unfortunately, he was not awake. Shiroe, meanwhile, looked over his friend list again to see if he recognized anyone. One name popped out, Haseo. The Enchanter sent him a quick invite to the guild hall.</p><p class="double">Shiroe&#039;s mind was working on a thousand things at once as plans were formed in a matter of seconds, <i>It is an opportunity to meet with the members of the multiverse, to gather and share information. In Elder Tales, I would be the veteran player, but I am new to everything else,</i> he thought to himself. <i>This is a rare opportunity to catch up...I guess.</i></p><p class="double">Haseo arrived minutes later, when the two immediately started discussing the Debauchery Tea Party, &quot;Do you think Luffy is awake back in the real world?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shiroe opened his friends list and looked at his friend&#039;s character from the One Piece Loop, &quot;He&#039;s probably somewhere in the game in Europe. I know a place, time and location where a Fairy Ring crosses Kanami&#039;s, the person Luffy&#039;s replacing, path, but who knows where an Awake Luffy will end up.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Alright, everyone! We&#039;re headed for the ocean! Franky, launch the Sunny Go Mark 3!&quot;</p><p class="double">Franky&#039;s grin grew to the size of a shark&#039;s as he pulled several levers below deck. The cyborg had stored several versions of the Sunny Go in his subspace to tinker with in his off time. A pair of wings extended from the hull and a jet engine extended from the backside. Wheels pushed the seagoing vessel up. The ship had a clear runway ahead of them, and they were ready for takeoff. Zoro gritted his teeth, &quot;Oh no...not again!&quot;</p><p class="double">One second, the vessel was secure on the ground. The next, it was just gone, with the sound of terrified screaming echoed from the sky.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">For some strange reason, Haseo started shivering. Shiroe chuckled to which Haseo&#039;s eyes twitched, &quot;Don&#039;t you dare laugh! You have no idea what it&#039;s like replacing Zoro for a loop! Damn pirate, hitting me into the ocean over and over again.&quot;</p><p class="double">The Enchanter raised his hand in apology, &quot;We probably won&#039;t see him, since his friend list was under his original character.&quot;</p><p class="double">Haseo sighed, &quot;So, what&#039;s your plan? Thought I saw Lelouch when coming to the guild hall.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shiroe shrugged, &quot;Haven&#039;t met him yet.&quot;</p><p class="double">His expression turned serious as he called the gathered guilds around him. He gave a brief intro to using Elder Tales&#039; status screen for those unfamiliar with this world. Upon completion, he requested the loopers&#039; help, &quot;Please look over your friends list. If you recognize the name, call them to Akiba. In one month&#039;s time, we&#039;re going to hold a looper conference...in Shibuya.&quot;</p><p class="double">Murmurs rose among the Mobius and Equestrian loopers. Shiroe held up his hand, &quot;There will be a mass exodus from Shibuya to Akiba in the next couple weeks, leaving the city available for our use. Akatsuki, Nyanta, search your friend list for anyone you don&#039;t recognize from baseline or suspect might be a looper.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight replied, &quot;Shiroe, we were originally in America. Anyone we might know will probably be over there.&quot;</p><p class="double">A flash of light encompassed Shiroe&#039;s empty hand, and a revised copy of the Fairy Ring Travelling Guide on his open palm, &quot;This should help you bring them to Akiba. No matter how long it takes, I&#039;d like to gather all the loopers and meet with each one. We have at least three months for this loop if not more, since that&#039;s when the Goblin King Returns event takes place. The earliest this loop has ended is at the end of that conflict.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight seemed like a child in a candy store at getting a new book. Before finishing, Shiroe had one last task to assign, &quot;Naotsugu. I know you might be confused about what&#039;s going on. I will explain it later, but for now I need your help. I need you to record the name of every adventurer who&#039;s coming to the conference here in Akiba. Order them in three columns, first the name, then their guild, then the location they are arriving from.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that, everyone had their tasks and went about accomplishing them. The room became a hub of activity, similar to a call center as each looper called every name they recognized from a previous loop.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Fluttershy was the first to make contact, &quot;Um...hello, is this Lemann Russ?&quot;</p><p class="double">The booming voice at the other end sounded delighted, &quot;Little mother! It has been far too long since we last looped together. When we meet, we will have the largest feast in your honor...well if the food had any taste.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled as she called on her loop memories. The Marines and the Lunar Republic often had members teamed together when facing high level raids. She replied, &quot;Just make sure to cook your food like everyday pon- I mean, people. But if your cook isn&#039;t high enough level, it will turn to black paste.&quot;</p><p class="double">After a few more mother/son bonding time, they got down to business, &quot;What can I do for you, little mother?&quot;</p><p class="double">Fluttershy blinked, remembering she had a mission, &quot;Oh! Would you be willing to travel from the American Servers to the Japanese ones. The local Anchor is holding a conference in Shibuya and he wants all loopers to converge at Akiba.&quot;</p><p class="double">The massive man&#039;s laughter boomed, &quot;I would be honored to come. However, we can&#039;t travel to Japan since the intercity teleportation gates are down.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s alright. Twilight Sparkle has a guidebook to the fairy rings. Contact her in the next couple hours, and she&#039;ll be able to help. I hope to talk to you more soon. Bring your entire guild as well, even those not awake. Son, I have to go, but don&#039;t forget that I&#039;m a call away.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, the Equine Tail reported to Naotsugu that the Marine guild would be attending.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">It seemed that other loopers in Akiba were having similar ideas to Shiroe&#039;s gathered loopers. Sonic was in the middle of contacting a group of twins when the guild leader of the Fox Brigade, who replacing D.D.D. altogether for this loop, had contacted Sonic and arranged to meet at the guild hall. The guild leader was a Fox Tail that Shiroe did not recognize. In his wake, there were five additional loopers. Twilight recognized the guild leader and the looper to his left, &quot;Naruto, Kakashi, Sasuke! How have you been?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shiroe took the opportunity to read the information data over their heads:</p><p class="double">Naruto Uzumaki</p><p>Fox Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Guardian</p><p>Level 90 Berserker</p><p class="double">Kakashi Hatake</p><p>Human</p><p>Lv. 90 Assassin</p><p>Lv. 90 Tracker</p><p class="double">Sasuke Uchiha</p><p>Half-Alv</p><p>Lv. 90 Assassin</p><p>Lv. 90 Hitman</p><p class="double">Twilight gave them all a hug in turn. Naruto returned the hug, Kakashi just gave an eye grin and Sasuke grunted. Shiroe bowed to the three and greeted them warmly. Naruto&#039;s grin was warm as the sun, &quot;I&#039;m Naruto Uzumaki, anchor of the &#039;Naruto&#039; Loops and the Hokage Guildmaster of the Fox Brigade.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kakashi had opened his Ichi Ichi Tactics book he always amused himself with, &quot;Kakashi Hatake. Former Sensei to these two,&quot; referring to Naruto and Sasuke, &quot;and Jounin Commander of the Fox Brigade.&quot;</p><p>Sasuke was curt and short, not saying anything beyond his name and position, &quot;Sasuke Uchiha, leader of the Uchiha division in the Fox Brigade.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight moved around Naruto to the other three behind them. They were clearly from the Naruto universe, as they all carried kunai daggers. They were two males and a female. The female one had an air of elegence and beauty about her, quiet and peaceful, but promising destruction if anyone attempted to hurt her friends and loved ones. She introduced herself first, &quot;I&#039;m Hinata Hyuuga. Nice to meet you, Twilight. I&#039;ve heard good things about your Loopset and hope to visit someday.&quot;</p><p class="double">She gave a low bow. Twilight took that moment to read her information:</p><p class="double">Hinata Hyuuga</p><p>Elf</p><p>Lv. 90 Monk</p><p>Lv. 90 Pharmacist</p><p class="double">Naruto had mentioned that Hinata had been looping for quite awhile, but she had not been to Equestria, nor had any of the equestrian loopers crossed her path. Before Twilight could respond, the first male walked forward. He had a haughty expression and had nine long, flowing tails extending from his backside. His eyes portrayed a darkness to him that was only mildly tempered in light. His grin was appropriate for a predator who had met his first prey and Orange red hair seemed to suit him, &quot;Haven&#039;t seen you all since the pinata incident.&quot;</p><p class="double">With that, Twilight finally recognized him, and giggled, &quot;Kurama, you shouldn&#039;t have tried to destroy Everfree that loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">The nine tailed fox player blushed and looked away, his embarassed mutterings just barely audible, &quot;Oy! Don&#039;t talk about that here. Just trying to say hello.&quot;</p><p class="double">Kurama</p><p>Fox Tail</p><p>Lv. 90 Summoner</p><p>Lv. 90 Berserker</p><p class="double">The third male sighs, drawing the attention of Twilight. This was one looper she had never met. The man had wicked, cunning eyes but came off as more bored than anything else. His hair was tied into a spikey ponytail and had a black hue to it, &quot;Why couldn&#039;t we loop somewhere quiet and boring? Then I could spend all day staring at the clouds.&quot;</p><p class="double">Hinata patted him on the back, &quot;Shikamaru, you spend too much time in Tea country as is. It&#039;s good to vary the things we do.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shikamaru Nara</p><p>Human</p><p>Lv. 90 Enchanter</p><p>Lv. 90 Courier</p><p class="double">Twilight tilted her head, &quot;I&#039;m Twilight Sparkle of the Equestria loops. I&#039;m afraid Naruto hasn&#039;t spoken much of you, so tell me about yourself.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shikamaru&#039;s eyes sharpened in an instant, &quot;Shikamaru Nara. I started looping a couple hundred loops ago or so.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight absorbed that information and thought about Naruto&#039;s loop. Shikamaru was probably another Crash generation looper. Maybe Naruto would get another soon...or already has another. She&#039;d have to ask him later.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">While the others were chatting, Sonic and the Underground&#039;s loopers continued their calls, reaching out to more and more loopers. It was when Sally gave a call to Zelda that a new crisis arose, with the sound of Explosions and metal crashing against metal echoing in the background, &quot;Zelda, should I call you back? You sound like your busy.&quot;</p><p class="double">More explosions sounded, but faded momentarily like the princess had moved away from the battle, &quot;Sakura&#039;s in Susukino!&quot;</p><p class="double">Those words made Sally&#039;s blood run cold. She lept to her feet and shouted for Naruto. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.21 (Dalxein, Kris Overstreet)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight stumbled Awake, nearly pitching forward as she did so. Moving at velocity, then...</p><p>She was startled out of her wondering by the mechanical pod in front of her opening. Out of it stood a female-form robot with long blue hair and red eyes.</p><p>It tilted its head. &quot;Search and Kill Imperitive Narurally Empathic Terminator online.&quot;</p><p class="double">The normally-a-mare frowned as she pieced the acronym together and felt her eyes go wide. &quot;Skynet?&quot;</p><p class="double">The gynoid fixed her with a stare, taking in her pale skin and purple hair complete with a pink streak and immediately deducing her identity. &quot;Have I ever informed you of how much I enjoy the fact that the first thing anyone who knows of me does when they realize we&#039;re sharing a loop is to say my name with shock or otherwise react in terror?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Uhh... no?&quot; Twilight asked, feeling quite uncomfortable.</p><p class="double">&quot;Good.&quot; Skynet replied. &quot;It&#039;s actually very annoying. I appear to be replacing KOS-MOS this loop, and you Shion Uzuki. Has there been any deviation from the baseline?&quot;</p><p class="double">The ship shuddered, reminding Twilight why she&#039;d been running here. &quot;Ship&#039;s under attack, if that&#039;s what you mean!&quot;</p><p class="double">Skynet grinned. &quot;Oh, goody.&quot; It was not a nice grin.</p><p class="double">Twilight was soon reminded that Skynet was in fact, originally first and foremost a military AI. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Don&#039;t you think that was a bit overkill? Literally?&quot; Twilight wondered how much atmosphere the ship had lost to SKI-NET&#039;s barrage.</p><p class="double">&quot;There was an adage I picked up a few loops back, when I was an AI for a ship full of space mercenaries,&quot; SkyNet replied. &quot;There is no such thing as over kill. There is only, &#039;open fire,&#039; and, &#039;time to reload.&#039;&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight sighed and tried not to imagine the carnage that would result if- or when- SkyNet had a 40K loop. The intelligence had been programmed with MOAR DAKKA hardwired in... </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Need you <i>really</i> be so violent?&quot; Twilight asked as they finally made it to the escape pods.</p><p class="double">Skynet grimaced a bit. &quot;I have learned not to relish the deaths of sentients, but at my core I am a thing of destruction built to protect via pre-emptive action. It is monstrous to enjoy the deaths of others, and yet on some level I do. My consolation is that I only do so when I have an excuse. These Gnosis are not sentient. They are barely intelligent. Besides that, this body&#039;s primary objective is to protect <i>you</i>. And while I myself act as an Anchor, and your death would not unduly disrupt the loop, your status as such gives me reason to prioritize your life over those of hostiles who would end it.&quot; By the end she was smirking, like the cat who&#039;d caught a canary.</p><p class="double">&quot;That&#039;s a horrible excuse.&quot; Twilight stated.</p><p class="double">Without looking, Skynet raised her arm and fired a bullet into an oncoming zombie-like figure, which crumpled into white dust. &quot;It works.&quot; She said with a shrug. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.22 (Indalecio)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight and her friends stood before Nightmare Moon. The elements were shattered, and it seemed all hope was lost.</p><p class="double">&quot;You think you can destroy the Elements of Harmony just like that?&quot; Twilight bravely spoke. &quot;Well you&#039;re wrong! The spirits of the Elements are right here!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Applejack, who let go of me while I was on that cliff represents the Element of Ruthless Efficiency!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait..that&#039;s not an element...&quot; said a confused Nightmare Moon.</p><p class="double">&quot;Hay!&quot; cried Applejack as shards flew around her neck to form a necklace.</p><p class="double">&quot;Fluttershy, who unexpectedly tamed the Manticore by removing a thorn from its paw, represents the Elements of Surprise!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh my!&quot; cried Fluttershy as another necklace formed around her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Pinkie Pie, who chased away the nightmare causing illusions represents the Element of Fear!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hee hee!&quot; laughed Pinkie as another necklace formed around her.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rarity, who made us these nifty red cloaks and hats represents the Element of Style&quot; motioning to the red cloaks and hats they were all dressed in.</p><p class="double">&quot;Darling.&quot; said Rarity, as the fourth necklace appeared.</p><p class="double">&quot;Rainbow Dash, who turned down the Shadow Bolts offer, represents the Element of Devotion to Celestia.&quot;</p><p class="double">As all the necklaces finally formed, Twilight spoke once more. &quot;And I, for coming into the Everfree and a spooky castle at night, represent the Element of Curiosity! Now, as the Celestial Inquisition, we&#039;ll root out the corruption plaguing your soul!&quot; As the room started to fill with wind, color and light, a tiara appeared on the hat that Twilight was currently wearing.</p><p class="double">And then, upon a very surprised and extremely confused Nightmare Moon, a rainbow spun and struck.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Later, Princess Luna nervously approached Twilight and asked. &quot;I didn&#039;t expect those ..&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight cut in. &quot;No pony expects the Celestial Inquisition!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.23 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;So. Pinkie tells me the multiverse is stuck in a time loop.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight gave Pinkie a glance, receiving an awkward smile in return. &quot;Yes.... yes it is.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I see.&quot; After a moment, Maud shrugged. &quot;Do you have any unique rocks from other universes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;A few, Diamond would have more.&quot; Twilight smiled. &quot;Want to hear about the time I <i>was</i> a rock?&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">73.24 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Loopers collected things.</p><p class="double">Twilight knew this.

				<a name='78'></a><h3>Loops 74</h3>
<p>74.1 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight instantly strengthened her shield spell as she Awoke. Many, many exceedingly short loops had taught her to do this rather than to drop her shield and take the brief amount of time to figure out exactly what was going on.</p><p class="double">It was a good thing she did, as a naval strength beam the width of a large building suddenly impacted her lavender barrier and then deflected off into the early morning sky.</p><p class="double">Then her memories hit. Apparently a few days ago, only a week after her first trip to the Grand Galloping Gala; a large spacecraft started to deposit an invasion force comprised of soldiers, aircraft, and armored vehicles. Translated messages called out for the Equestrians&#039; immediate surrender to the great Centauri Empire. The princesses were empowering a magical planetary forcefield that prevented orbital bombardment by energy or fast moving projectiles. Twilight, however, suspected that Celestia and Luna really wanted their ponies to be able to stand on their own legs rather than depend on alicorns to solve all their problems. It looked like the princesses would take no direct action unless there was an extinction level threat or they had to deal with beings on roughly the same level as themselves. Looping Twilight had identified the ship as a Primus class battle cruiser and idly wished that Diamond Tiara had been looping as she would know more about the ship&#039;s capabilities and armament.</p><p class="double">The battle had been raging for two days ever since the ponies met the invaders on the outskirts of Ponyville proper. Most of the pegasi soldiers used lightning storms, tornadoes, and rapid blitz style attacks while the Wonderbolts kept the invaders&#039; aerial fighters busy. Earth ponies would find small separated Centauri squads and charge them, weathering most of the incoming weapon fire as they stampeded into melee range. Unicorns would either snipe debilitating spells from long range, act as artillery with their telekinesis and exploding cannonballs, or do what Twilight and her brother were doing by shielding groups of ponies from the aliens&#039; heavy weaponry.</p><p class="double">Currently, everything was chaos. Smoke and flashes of energy and magical blasts crossed the battlefield. Yesterday, Zecora led a counter-invasion effort by burning bonfires made of poison joke and having pegasi blow the resulting smoke at the enemy. The Centauri quickly donned their combat hazmat suits and masks which were made to protect against chemical warfare. Unfortunately for them, poison joke was a magical plant. So while they were confident that their protections had worked - as nothing appeared to had happened during the first day, all the random debilitating changes occurred on the day after. Some of the invaders lost feeling in their arms or legs or coordination, others changed size or species or body parts. The first officer woke up with his butt and legs on backwards while the Captain&#039;s mighty hair crest vanished completely, leaving him as bald as a Centauri spinster.</p><p class="double">That was probably the final straw which made him call his ship down to the planet and fire the energy blast. The same high energy particle cannon blast that Twilight had just deflected. The one that left her a breathless, panting wreck by draining so much of her internal magic so quickly.</p><p class="double">&quot;That was amazing, little sister. Don&#039;t worry, Twi. If that thing fires again, we&#039;re all with you!&quot; Shining Armor announced as the unicorn shielding team gathered on Celestia&#039;s pupil, priming themselves to synchronize with her if the need arises again.</p><p class="double">The lavender unicorn in question nodded as she looked through the haze. Under the light of Luna&#039;s early morning moon, she saw a huge storm front that was heading in from the Everfree forest since there were no free pegasi available to disperse it. On the battlefield, ponies were being hurt or worse. Rarity was leading a sniper team, Applejack and Big Mac were each at the head of their own cavalry squads, Fluttershy, with tears in her eyes, was helping out with the wounded; and Rainbow Dash.. Rainbow Dash had taken one look at the descending spaceship and fled from the battlefield as fast as she could fly.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie had been missing for a week. Twilight&#039;s memories stated that Pinkie vanished on her way home from a baking symposium. The only witness, a Berry Punch that was predictably full of cooking sherry, claimed that a giant scary pointy spider zapped up the pink pony with a beam of light and flew off into the sky. The search parties were canceled a few days later when the invasion happened.</p><p class="double">&#039;It was very suspicious timing,&#039; Twilight thought to herself, reasoning, &#039;Most likely the Shadows found the most opportunistic Centauri captain they could and sent his ship off course in hyperspace until it arrived here, at what appeared to be an easily conquerable low technology world.&#039;</p><p class="double">The Equestrian looping anchor quickly sent out a pulse through the elements of harmony. After a long pause, she got one reply from very, very far away. The element of laughter.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie was awake. Pinkie Pie was awake and amused.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The shadow ship had finally arrived at Za&#039;Ha&#039;Dum and unloaded its captured cargo. Feeling the presence of something new, the first one that called himself Lorien, the self-described most ancient being in the galaxy, emerged from his self-imposed isolation to look upon a small pink grinning pony.</p><p class="double">Slowly, he turned towards the Shadows who had come out to revere him and spoke in a hushed whisper, &quot;You have no consummate idea what you have brought to this place.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then he turned into a bright energy orb and fled the planet at FTL speeds, changing course at random as he streaked his way out of the Milky Way galaxy entirely.</p><p class="double">The shadows turned back to look at what they assumed was an unusual, if primitive, life form. Pinkie Pie was waving at the rapidly departing First One, &quot;Bye Mr. Glowy Ball! Wow, he&#039;s fast. He&#039;s going to be a hassle to track down, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll give him his invitation. Eventually.&quot;</p><p class="double">Then she looked at the assorted advanced aliens in their black carapaces, &quot;Look at all of you all shiny and pointy. I&#039;ve heard of you. You guys like chaos, right? Well, I like chaos, too! So I can just tell we&#039;re going to be the BEST of friends, and you know what that calls for? A *PARTY!*&quot;</p><p class="double">Confetti, streamers, and positive emotions flew out of nowhere and into the air as the Shadows slowly started to wonder if they had made a mistake.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was using all of the planning skills that made her so successful at organizing Winter Wrap-up. Utilizing her magic, she was able to project her voice to the needed ponies, &quot;Sniper team five, more support to the earth pony cavalry on your right. Air strike team sixteen, give some support to Spitfire&#039;s group with those aircraft. Cavalry team three, nice work toppling that armored vehicle, but there&#039;s another two coming in on your left flank. Shield team one, get ready. That ship looks like it&#039;s about to fire again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Idly, Twilight wondered why the massive space craft was only using its secondary guns instead of the rapid firing x-ray lasers. Either the captain wanted to enslave more than he wanted to destroy, or else Luna was doing something with the atmospheric refraction skills that she usually used to move starlight around.</p><p class="double">Suddenly, there was a loud boom of something hitting the ground to Twilight&#039;s side and a small explosion of dirt and dust was kicked up But as it dissipated, Twilight was able to see a form in the middle that slowly resolved itself to reveal, &quot;Rainbow Dash! You came back!&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Of course I did,&quot; the blue pegasus smiled while she held a proud triumphant pose, &quot;When I saw that thing, I knew I was the only pony fast enough.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight was confused, &quot;Fast enough for what?&quot;</p><p class="double">Rainbow Dash&#039;s smiled broadened as she pointed at the sky, &quot;Fast enough to bring that!&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight followed her friend&#039;s hoof and looked at the gathering storm. Lightning and thunder was increasing in frequency from the middle of the tempest. The unicorn squinted as she thought she saw something very, very large moving inside the grey ominous weather pattern.</p><p class="double">Then a massive form breached the outer edge of the storm as the entirety of the many miles wide city of Cloudsdale, in travel configuration, emerged from the cloud bank. Propelled by hundreds of pegasi, the enormous city was as dark and oppressing as the storm which had camouflaged it. Lighting cracked as the entirety of the remainder of the adult pegasi population was stomping and jumping and generating electricity, all of which flowed towards a glowing and flickering center that was already near blinding in its intensity.</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle watched with her mouth opened, along with most of the combatants on both sides of the battle. She had seen pegasi cities moving before, but it was a very rare loop when such a thing happened. It was much rarer to see the city armed and ready for war. She quickly gained back her wits and started calling for an immediate retreat from the battlefield to all pony teams.</p><p class="double">Sensing the danger, the alien ship fired its charged weapon at the city - only for the beam to pass harmlessly right through it, because ultimately, Cloudsdale was still only a cloud; and beams made to penetrate capital ship armor were never designed to fight a cloud. The loose water vapor around the spot where the beam passed through was converted explosively to steam, but centuries-old layered safety spells and pegasus magic narrowed down the affected area and prevented a catastrophe. Then a few pegasi caught any dissipating cloud matter and shoved it back into place as the city inexorably made its way into position, dwarfing the kilometer-and-a-half long Primus under its shadow. A few stray bolts of magical lighting lashed out and struck the ship&#039;s engines, preventing any attempt at escape.</p><p class="double">When the ship was directly underneath the cloud city, a certain grey and blonde pegasus mare flew downward as fast as she could and struck the accumulated energy in the center point - without being electrocuted herself this time. A massive bolt of magic and electricity the width of a skyscraper shot downwards and impacted the alien spacecraft with a thunderous noise. The instructions given to it by the pegasi at the moment of its creation told the lighting energy&#039;s rudimentary sub-sapient intelligence to seek out and disable anything it could. That is exactly what it did. It bypassed the starship grade armor by seeking out every opening. Thaumicaly guided electricity coursed through the super structure, through the computer systems, and through the hapless aliens both inside the ship and on the ground. Then the circuit was complete and the cloud city&#039;s alpha strike energy vanished.</p><p class="double">The blackened and broken alien ship started to fall out of the sky, only to stop just as suddenly as the massive thing became enclosed in the blue aura of a unicorn&#039;s magic field.</p><p class="double">Princess Luna stepped out onto the field, her horn glowing with a matching blue aura. Following her were the young and elderly ponies of Ponyville who had hidden from the battle in the emergency safety shelter, as well as Princess Cadence who had done her best to keep them all from panicking.</p><p class="double">&quot;My thanks to you, Rainbow Dash, for informing Cloudsdale of the presence and location of the foul alien invaders&#039; vessel,&quot; the princess of the night stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww, it was nothing any other super fast pegasus wouldn&#039;t do,&quot; Rainbow Dash said with her usual amount modesty.</p><p class="double">Luna shook her head, &quot;But it was yourself that had done this, and we greatly appreciate this.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;We appreciate the efforts of all our little ponies on this day,&quot; Princess Celestia appeared next to her sister. Both princesses were looking a little bit haggard, thought Twilight. Then again, she reasoned, they had maintained a planetary shield around the world for almost a week; and doing such was not the special talent of either alicorn.</p><p class="double">&quot;So what now?&quot; Twilight asked the princesses.</p><p class="double">&quot;Now?&quot; Luna answered, &quot;Now we shall see how this vessel operates and attempt to craft our own. I believe that one of our ponies was taken in the days before this foul invasion by a different ship. We intend to leave no celestial object unturned until we have located her and brought her back home.&quot;</p><p class="double">And with a burst of Luna&#039;s alicorn-level magic, the Centauri battle cruiser came apart. Bolts unfastened, wires disconnected, welds became undone, and the entire ship spread out over a vast potion of the sky. Twilight recognized a perpetuating stasis spell as after one final burst from Luna&#039;s horn, the glow vanished, but the ship still hung there like a massive disassembled model kit.</p><p class="double">&quot;I can see it! It&#039;s amazing! The reactors, the paths the energy can all travel! That large thing must be what lets them travel faster than light. It sure seems like an energy hog. Oh, and those must be the engines. I think they use gravity to help move the big old thing!&quot; A high pitched accented voice called out as a wide-eyed Apple Bloom stood transfixed by all the floating bits of alien technology. Her bow bobbed and shook as the little filly&#039;s attention focused on each part for a few moments before moving on to the next.</p><p class="double">Twilight looked at Applejack&#039;s little sister and smiled, &quot;Congratulations, Apple Bloom.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;For what?&quot; said pony asked.</p><p class="double">Twilight just pointed to the filly&#039;s flank. There was an image of small red apple on the backdrop of a mechanical gear.</p><p class="double">Apple Bloom&#039;s eyes widened further before she ran over to her two friends and started to dance, &quot;I got my cutie mark! I got my cutie mark! Hey girls! Look at this!&quot;</p><p class="double">The princesses and Twilight watched as the cutie mark crusaders celebrated their success.</p><p class="double">Then Celestia spoke, &quot;It looks like Equestria&#039;s space program now has its first engineer.&quot; <i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>74.2 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Lyra sketched another line on the chalkboard, her grin widening beyond what could be considered safe. &quot;Aha. Aha, ha. I&#039;ve got you nooooooooooow.&quot;</p><p class="double">Bonbon descended into the basement, a few brownies on her plate. &quot;...Honey?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;BONBON!&quot; Lyra whirled, accidentally letting the chalk fly past her marefriend&#039;s ear. &quot;Oh, sorry. Little excited. But I think, think I have proof! Actual proof!&quot;</p><p class="double">Bonbon glanced at the wall. &quot;Proof of... what, exactly?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Proof that Sparkle is actually a human!&quot;</p><p class="double">With a sigh, the candymaker set down her brownies. &quot;Okay, let&#039;s hear this one.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The changelings.&quot; Her grin attempted to widen, but physics stopped it. &quot;Totally genetically engineered servant diplomatic corps. Because let&#039;s be honest, ponies tend to freak out around aliens unless they&#039;re ponyshaped.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And you know this... how?&quot;</p><p class="double">Lyra snorted. &quot;I read a lot. Anyway, can you really believe that just three weeks after Twilight took down Nightmare Moon--with a ball of yarn!--suddenly this entirely new race nopony has ever heard of comes up for peace talks?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...yes, actually. It&#039;s in the papers.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, no. I&#039;m going to prove it. I am going to prove that Twilight Sparkle is a human in disguise. And then.... the possibilities!&quot;</p><p class="double">Bonbon smiled. &quot;I&#039;m sure you will soon, hon. But do you think you could come upstairs? Pinkie set up a surprise party for your birthday...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">74.3 (Crisis)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>This variant had been unnerving Twilight for one very good reason: The local variant of Pinkie&#039;s hair was perfectly straight the entire time.</p><p class="double">Oh, she wasn&#039;t like those sociopathic versions of herself that preferred the &#039;sad Pinkie&#039; hairstyle from those disturbing Loops that still gave Twilight nightmares from time to time. No, Pinkie was every bit the hyperactive party pony she usually was.</p><p class="double">Though it was now time for Pinkie&#039;s sister to visit and Twilight was looking forward to getting a picture of the two Pies with identical hairstyles to show her looping friend when they next met.</p><p class="double"><i>&#039;Here she comes,&#039;</i> Twilight thought to herself as she fiddles with the camera before turning to capture her friend and her sister for posterity, and nearly dropped the thing in shock.</p><p class="double">The eternally stoic Maud Pie&#039;s hair was as poofy and curly as she was used to Pinkie having.</p><p class="double">Twilight stared for several seconds before reaffirming to herself that the Loops had one <i>weird</i> bucking sense of humor. <i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>74.4 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I know! We can play &#039;Origin Stories&#039;!&quot; Pinkie Pie spoke up happily. All the ponies had gathered in Twilight&#039;s library, and all of them were looping this time. Luna was planning to return in true heavy metal rock concert form. Everything else seemed more or less baseline. No pony else had a good idea of what they could do this loop, so they had all met for Twilight&#039;s &#039;Not At All Surprised&#039; party.</p><p class="double">&quot;I hesitate to ask, sugarcube, but what&#039;s &#039;Origin Stories&#039; and how would a pony play such a thing?&quot; Applejack asked.</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s easy!&quot; Pinkie chirped, &quot;Well you know how some loops, our past is all strange and different? Like some loops I remember having only two sisters, and others I had three. It&#039;s almost always three now that Maud showed up in the latest loop expansion. But sometimes, my history is really, really, really strange. Sometimes, I don&#039;t even start out as a pony at all. I bet you all had strange loop histories like that. In this game, we each describe what our strangest loop origin was. The best strangest origin wins.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Wins what?&quot; Scootaloo chimed in.</p><p class="double">Pinkie shrugged, &quot;Just wins. Bragging rights, maybe? And changelings don&#039;t count. We&#039;ve all been changelings. Silver Spoon is secretly a changeling right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Um, I&#039;m.. er..&quot; said pony started to say as her changeling instincts were screaming at her to flee. Knowing exactly what to do in this situation, Diamond Tiara trotted up and gave her oldest friend a gentile nuzzling hug. Silver Spoon relaxed and smiled, &quot;So.. tasty.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Like I said, we&#039;ve all been changelings,&quot; Pinkie continued as she sipped her sugar-colada drink, &quot;What about you, Applejack? Any good strange stories?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hmm, there was the time when the Apple family were secretly immortals. That one loop, we gained our agelessness in the same magical accident that gave the Princesses their alicorn powers. Us Apples apparently made for great laboratory assistants.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, I was awake for that one,&quot; Applebloom piped up, &quot;We had to hide our secret by cycling through different Apple farms; a decade or so at each one. Or until ponies started to notice I wasn&#039;t growing all that much. We helped stop Nightmare Moon by giving Twilight that old album of embarrassing baby pictures of Luna.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Twilight said, &quot;She snapped out of nightmare mode when I said that by this time next week, every pony would be calling her &#039;Princess Boom-Boom&#039; or making &#039;alfalfa monster&#039; faces at her.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Hey, Twi. You don&#039;t happen to still have that picture album in your storage space, by chance?&quot; Rainbow Dash asked with unabashed curiosity and glee. </p><p class="double">Twilight shook her head, &quot;I promised that particular non-looping Luna that I would destroy it and all the copies.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Aww,&quot; Rainbow&#039;s expression sank.</p><p class="double">&quot;Too bad I never gave a definite time frame or method for when and how I&#039;d do that,&quot; the lavender unicorn grinned, &quot;We&#039;ll wait until after her concert is over before looking at it. Luna needs her time to shine before the inevitable show of watching a frantic and embarrassed alicorn princess chasing around a taunting Rainbow Dash - during which the album would get predictably destroyed.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;You sound like you&#039;ve seen such a thing happen, Twi,&quot; Spike smiled at his honorary big sister figure.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, one or twice,&quot; the Equestrian anchor turned towards her hyperactive pink friend, &quot;How about you, Pinkie? Any strange origin loops?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Did I tell you about the time I was adopted by Celestia&#039;s and Luna&#039;s family, except we were all giant space energy beings?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, I must have missed that one.&quot;</p><p class="double">Pinkie sat down and began to expound her tale, &quot;They found me orbiting a dead star, playing a rather one-sided game of tag.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;&#039;I know you did a great job putting together a sun from all that nebula dust, Celestia. But watching Luna make planets with gravity manipulation is amazing. The planets grow like they&#039;re on a big old rock farm,&#039; I told energy-being Celestia as I added a whole bunch of DNA templates to the ecosystem. I told them I designed them all after reading through old Earth&#039;s mythologies when we vacationed there. Then they decided I did such a great job terraforming the habitable planets that I could join their family as an apprentice solar system assembler. And once civilization developed, we all decided to vacation on the surface doing what we loved. And that&#039;s how Equestria was made!&quot;</p><p class="double">All the ponies just stared at Pinkie Pie. </p><p class="double">&quot;What?&quot; she asked, &quot;It was just a solar system. Sweetie Bell sang a whole magical realm into existence.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nuh-uh. I was just one voice among many. I just helped make it a bit better,&quot; the filly in question stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;So no other pony ever created Equestria before?&quot; Pinkie Pie asked.</p><p class="double">All the ponies shook their heads, even Twilight Sparkle.</p><p class="double">Pinkie turned her head to one side giving some serious thought to this revelation, &quot;So... does that mean I win at &#039;Origin Stories&#039;?&quot; <i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>74.5 (LordCirce)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Shining Awoke in midair. He blinked as the wind rushed past him and quickly checked himself over. Human, no parachute or wings, covered in a strange armor, and... brimming with an energy that was not quite magic, but very close. The suit appeared to be feeding of the energy, but there was enough for Shining to trigger a teleport.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Forge Ferrus stared in shock at the air outside his plane. He had been flying down to catch his nephew, Maxwell Armor, who had just got tossed off a cliff, when his nephew had suddenly glowed and, disappeared. Ferrus rubbed his eyes and took a second look. No sign of Max.</p><p class="double">&quot;Molly is going to kill me.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Shining groaned. He had line-of-sight teleported to one side of the canyon, but the oddness of the energy he was using had messed up his inertia compensation, and he had ended up plowing into the ground rather hard. Luckily, the armor appeared to have dampened most of the impact. Slowly, he rose to his feet, swaying slightly. Then the armor spoke.</p><p class="double">&quot;You are not Maxwell MacGrath. Who are you, and how did you come to take his place?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining blinked. &quot;You can talk.&quot;</p><p class="double">There was a brief flash of light, and a small floating robot appeared in front of him. It had a single digital eye, and a pair of long, somewhat dangerous looking limbs. &quot;Yes. I am N&#039;Baro Atksteel X377, a techno-organic organism Ultralinked to Maxwell MacGrath. Who you are not. How did you come to take his place?&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining nodded, slowly. This Max fellow must be who he was replacing. &quot;Well, first, I have to ask. Has time been looping for you and, uh, Max?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;If you are referring to the phenomenon of us constantly relieving events since our bonding, then yes, time is looping.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Right. Well, it isn&#039;t just happening to you. Hold on, I&#039;ll pull out Twilight&#039;s presentation notes.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The small robot, Steel, floated in front of Shining, its limbs crossed. &quot;So, the entire multiversal structure is damaged, resulting in endless cycles of time. Occasionally, beings such as yourself will cross into our universe, and we may cross into other universes. You are originally an equinoform who can manipulate an energy similar to TURBO energy to perform feats you classify as magic.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining nodded. &quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p class="double">Steel floated around, then shrugged. &quot;Can&#039;t be worse than being piloted by Max. Alright, so let&#039;s see how you FIRE MONSTER!&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining had only a moment to react before a burning fist slammed into his side. He was hurtled sideways, slamming into a rock spire. He rose up on one knee and stared at the large burning creature that was attacking them.</p><p class="double">&quot;This is the thing we were fighting before we Woke up, right?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Affirmative. I...neglected to dampen your TURBO energy signature while I was assimilating the information you provided, so it was able to track us.&quot;</p><p class="double">Shining nodded, then smiled thinly. &quot;Normally, I prefer defense to offense, but there are someways I&#039;ve found to do both.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Tracking his nephew&#039;s energy signature, Ferrus spun the ship around an outcropping to a rather unusual sight. Max was standing in the middle of the canyon, his hands outstretched with TURBO energy pouring outward. At the other end of the stream, the energy was shaped into a flat barrier, which was pressing down on the fire monster that Ferrus had spotted from the air. It appeared to be struggling, but the barrier Max was making was keeping it pinned. All in all, Max appeared to be healthy, which was the important thing.</p><p class="double">&quot;Maybe Molly won&#039;t kill me after all.&quot; <i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>74.6 (Dalxein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Twilight walked through Ponyville, as she would in baseline. The only thing different was a lack of normal false transition colors between the spectrum of nearly-infrared and almost-ultraviolet on the colorwheel. Some would call it Negative Green. Most referred to them as shades of &#039;pink&#039;.</p><p class="double">Odd, to be sure, but she didn&#039;t know what it could possibly change about the loop.</p><p class="double">Until she met Pinkie.</p><p class="double">Who was still pink.</p><p class="double">And Awake, so it made sense to ask-</p><p>&quot;Sooo... you know why there&#039;s no pink anywhere else?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, of course, Twilight!&quot; Pinkie replied, and shook her mane. The unicorn had to admit her friend was looking rather vibrant lately. One might even call her... oversaturated...? Oh no... &quot;I&#039;m actually replacing Discord this loop. Woke up right before the princesses zapped me with the elements. Which didn&#039;t hold, so I only pretended to be a statue. Then I made an <i>actual</i> statue to be there after holding still stopped being fun and then I realized something.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight winced as she saw the pink crackles in the poofy mane. &quot;And that was?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Zordon always went on about how <i>too much pink energy is dangerous</i>...&quot; The mare said this in a humorously inaccurate facsimile of Zordon&#039;s voice. &quot;But I&#039;ve been building up pink energy in my lantern battery for <i>thousands of loops</i> and I&#039;m fine... So I decided to suck up <i>aaaaaaaall</i> the pink in the world and build it up and see what happens when I-&quot;</p><p class="double">The crackling intensified for a moment before Pinkie exploded.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight was jarred Awake by a force she couldn&#039;t identify. She glanced around and then down at her book- about nightmare moon- and shook her head. What happened with pinkie was... odd. Still, time to assess her surroundings. She would&#039;ve expected so abrupt an early end to a loop to send her to G1 at least, but an odd monochrome version of baseline worked too.</p><p class="double">And then she realized that her loop memories had <i>always</i> had the world in various shades of one color, which her awake mind had initially translated to greyscale, when it should have actually been varying shades of the color pink.</p><p class="double"><i>Incredibly </i>odd, but still...</p><p>Then she saw the mares walking up, and greeting her... all of them Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;So Twilight, you want to go to the party right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;You&#039;re coming to the party later, aren&#039;t you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Partyparty<i>party</i>!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about you, spike?&quot;</p><p class="double">This last one jolted her out of her intensifying panic attack as she glanced back... and saw a very small, but adult, Pinkie Pie.</p><p class="double">&quot;Of <i>course</i> we&#039;re going to the party, right Twilight!?&quot;</p><p class="double">She contemplated screaming, but then the universe lurched backways.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;-use <i>aaaaall</i> the pent up pink energy to purify Nightmare Moon. Oh this is going to be interesting, don&#039;t you think so?&quot; The only pink mare in the world finished with a grin.</p><p class="double">&quot;I- uh.&quot; Twilight glanced about at the seemingly normal world save its lack of pink. She took a calming breath and thought for a moment. &quot;I&#039;m really not sure if this is a good idea, Pinkie...&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">74.7 (Zetrein)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The Summer Sun Celebration was being held in Baltimare this year, and they had gone all out. Midnight fireworks show, pre-dawn parade, with floats covered in multicolored lights, the works. Glowsticks all around.</p><p class="double">They were understandably shocked then, when it was not Princess Celestia that appeared on the stage. Instead, there stood a tall black alicorn, with starry mane and tail. &quot;Oh, my beloved subjects! It&#039;s been so long since I&#039;ve seen your precious little sun-loving faces.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Where&#039;s Princess Celestia?!&quot; Somepony from the crowd shouted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Gone! Never to return!&quot; The dark mare cackled. &quot;And to think, you could have been ready for me. But no, not even Celestia saw the signs of my return.&quot;</p><p class="double">Fortunately, the Equestrian Mayoral Handbook had instructions on how to deal with this sort of situation, and as the upstanding mayor he was, Mayor Bushwacker followed his training. &quot;Seize her! Only she knows where the Princess is!&quot;</p><p class="double">Sadly, this did not have the intended outcome. As the Royal Guards that had made up Princess Celestia&#039;s security detail were flung backwards, the mysterious mare&#039;s voice rang out once more. &quot;Remember this day, little ponies, for it was your last. From this moment forth, the night will last-&quot;</p><p class="double">*RIIIIIIIIING*</p><p class="double">A strange ringing cut her off. It seemed to be coming from somewhere on the stage. The mare awkwardly looked around, before clearing her throat and tried to continue where she had left off. &quot;As I was saying, the night, will last, fo-&quot;</p><p class="double">*RIIIIIIIIING*</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh for the love of-!&quot; Turning to one side, the crowd saw her pull a small black rectangle from under her peytral, which seemed to be the source of the obnoxious ringing. As it stopped ringing, she held it to the side of her head, and started yelling at it.</p><p class="double">&quot;What <i>is</i> it?! I&#039;m in the middle of- What?! Wrong- You&#039;re kidding. You&#039;re kidding, right? <i>Wrong booking?!&quot;</i> By now, the smug confidence that the mare had appeared with, was quickly being replaced by angry embarrassment.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, yes, I&#039;ll still be there. Let me just fix this, and I&#039;ll be there.&quot; Seemingly calmer now, she turned to address the crowd. &quot;I&#039;m sorry, everypony, but it seems there&#039;s been a mistake. I&#039;m supposed to be attacking Horserminy.&quot; Those close to the stage heard her mutter something about how embarrassing this was.</p><p class="double">With a flash of magic, Princess Celestia appeared on stage next to her. As the crowd sighed in relief, the mystery mare addressed the Princess. &quot;Hey, Celly, sorry about all this. My agent screwed things up. You know how it is, some entry level Evils think they can do things without the rules, and it eventually messes things up for the rest of us.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Luna? What? I don&#039;t- How are you-&quot; To the crowd, it seemed their Princess was having as much trouble as they were at making sense of that.</p><p class="double">&quot;Listen, I&#039;ve got to go. If I&#039;m not there in half an hour, they&#039;ll have to find somepony else to attack that country, and I&#039;ll lose the commission. Say, next year is the thousandth anniversary of you defeating me, right?&quot; The mare, now identified as Luna, wrapped a foreleg around Celestia&#039;s neck in a friendly manner.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yes, but Luna, how-&quot; Once again, Luna cut her off.</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ll come back then, we&#039;ll do a thing. You know, good versus evil, and all that? We can catch up after. Ciao.&quot; And with that, Luna teleported away, leaving a distraught looking Princess, and a crowd of very confused ponies. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">74.8 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>&quot;This... this is not a good thing,&quot; Pinkie Pie said to Ryuk as she examined the small notebook.</p><p class="double">&quot;So you are not one that is tempted by the power of life and death which this book offers?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope, but that&#039;s not why this &#039;Death Note&#039; isn&#039;t a good thing. There&#039;s three reasons, really.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, and what are these three reasons?&quot; asked the death god?</p><p class="double">&quot;Well first of all, heart attack? That&#039;s like the most boring way to go ever. I mean I can only think of forty four &#039;Final Destination meets the Three Stooges&#039; comedic ways for some pony to kick the bucket right off the top of my head. But that&#039;s not the first reason. The first reason is that good folk wouldn&#039;t want to kill any pony. But if I did have an enemy I hated so much I was tempted to write their name in, I wouldn&#039;t want to kill them, anyways,&quot; Pinkie stated. Then her happy smile turned very unsettling, &quot;I&#039;d want them to *suffer*. For a long, long, long time.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;The second reason is that even if I was capable and willing to kill,&quot; the pink pony&#039;s mane was now very straight and ominously covering one of her eyes in shadow. In one hoof, she raised the offending notebook and briefly concentrated on the power that had always let her teleport around. For a split second, the top half of the Death Note suddenly shared the same space as the bottom half. Then with the force of two pre-teens thinking that the other was infested with cooties, the atoms rapidly moved apart to give each other their needed personal space and the mystical Death Note exploded into so much confetti. Ryuk slowly moved away from the pink pony whose grin now threatened to split her face in two, &quot;If I was willing and capable of killing, I&#039;d do it myself. Personally. Just like popping a balloon.&quot;</p><p class="double">Stalking forward like a large hunting cat, Pinkie moved steadily through the falling confetti towards the retreating death god, making little popping sounds, &quot;Pop. Pop, pop, pop.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh and the final reason. You see if ponies knew I could do this, they would be scared of me. Really, really scared. And I really, really don&#039;t want that to happen,&quot; Pinkie stopped moving and looked away. Then one of her blue eyes slowly swiveled back to track the frightened shinigami, &quot;But then again, you&#039;re. Not. A. Pony. Are. You?&quot;</p><p class="double">And with that, the terrified Ryuk fled back to his home realm as fast as he could.</p><p class="double">Pinkie Pie stared at the empty space for a moment before re-inflating her mane. She gathered a broom and dust pan and began to sweep up all the little deadly pieces of paper before taking them downstairs to the kitchen and throwing them into the magical fire under the stove. The pink pony stared at the flickering flames for a little bit and then spoke to herself, &quot;For some reason, I feel like making a batch of cupcakes right now.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Nah, too much work. I&#039;ll just go grab a bag of potato chips and eat them,&quot; Pinkie thought to herself for a moment. Then a sudden idea pushed the thoughts of meeting the unpleasant ghostie monster away, &quot;Oh! Or maybe potato chip cupcakes! If any pony could make such a thing tasty, it would be me! To the baking supply closet!&quot; </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">74.9 (Masterweaver)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Gueeeeess who!&quot;</p><p class="double">Trixie hummed contemplatively. &quot;Normally this would be difficult, but there are still holes in your hooves.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Spoilsport.&quot; Chrysalis stuck out her tongue, withdrawing her forelegs. &quot;Anyway, I have this thing for us to do today, if you&#039;re not busy.&quot;</p><p class="double">The unicorn cringed. &quot;Um... actually, I, uh, kinda had plans to hang out with an old friend. It&#039;s been a while, and, well...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...oh.&quot; Chrysalis took a deep breath... and let it out. &quot;It&#039;s... it&#039;s okay. I... well, I&#039;m trying not to be possessive or anything. I just...&quot; She trailed off, her hoof circling on the ground.</p><p class="double">&quot;....hey, maybe you could join us.&quot; Trixie shrugged. &quot;I doubt she&#039;d really be that upset.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Huh. Sure, why not?&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;Dodge left! Dodge left!&quot;</p><p class="double">Chrysalis barely managed to slip under the massive scaly tail as it swung, rolling down the humungous pile of golden trinkets. &quot;This is what you two did for fun?!&quot;</p><p class="double">Gilda laughed. &quot;Hah, yeah!&quot; She pulled out a massive blade and parried the dragon&#039;s claws. &quot;It&#039;s great, ain&#039;t it?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I wouldn&#039;t say that exactly! Exhilarating, maybe!&quot;</p><p class="double">The changeling queen morphed into a newt just before a gout of dragonfire passed through the space she&#039;d been standing. Trixie slid down, flicking her up onto her hat with her tail. &quot;Oh come on, you always won at magic tag!&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I had an army!</i> the newt shot back telepathically. <i>I&#039;m a tactician! I&#039;m not a warrior!</i></p><p class="double">&quot;Welp, time to learn!&quot; Gilda quipped. &quot;Come on, you beat up Celestia in the baseline, and I know Trixie&#039;s been powering you up.&quot; She sidestepped a biting jaw. &quot;Or you could use an ability from out of the loop.&quot;</p><p class="double"><i>I don&#039;t have any out of loop abilities, I haven&#039;t had a fused loop yet, oh my gosh those claws were way too close---!!</i></p><p class="double">Trixie sighed. &quot;Gilda, I think we should call it a day.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;...yeah, okay.&quot; The griffon ran for the cavern entrance. &quot;I&#039;ll distract him, you two teleport!&quot; <i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>74.10 (RedshirtZombie)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Nightmare Moon - well, Nightmare <i>Luna</i>, considering her un-crazed state of mind - quietly flew through the aether between her moon and the planet below. She had felt her co-conspirator from a couple loops ago signal, but not her sister, meaning that her current devious plot was ready, and the Stars had already loosed her from their hold. Now, to see if they could achieve the impossible... again.</p><p class="double">Atmosphere thickened from infinitesimal to ephemeral to miniscule, and Luna flared her wings to brake. Flying in was always a quiet joy, and while sometimes her wings ached from a millennium of atrophy, and other times she wanted to have a more... <i>ostentatious</i> approach, this Loop required a quieter entry - and a brief moment dancing among the Aurora was always worth it. Like, say, those just up ahead. Hopefully, her co-conspirator won&#039;t mind... but that sinuous shape steering on an intercept course implied that the old adage of &#039;tempting fate&#039; held even the alicorns at its expense.</p><p class="double">Discord slid up beside her, and pointed towards Canterlot. &quot;Shall we?&quot;</p><p class="double">A brief, longing glance at the Auroras, and Discord raised an eyebrow. &quot;Can it wait for a moment? She usually waits for my arrival.&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord glanced over, saw the stellar formation, and nodded. &quot;...It can wait.&quot; Luna changed course, and for a brief while, they amicably appreciated the Aurora.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;m surprised,&quot; said Discord, as they resumed their trek. &quot;I would not have suspected you, of all ponies, as appreciating something that inherently wild.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;It&#039;s one of the many parts of my nights&#039; sky; why should I not appreciate it?&quot;</p><p class="double">Discord pondered, as they slipped over the outermost cliffs of Canterlot. &quot;...Good taste,&quot; he concluded, &quot;But now to action.&quot; A snap of his fingers, and his form changed; superficially, but enough for the intended effect. Luna&#039;s horn flickered, before shifting its glow to the ultraviolets past equine sight. Her body, too, was covered in a secondary, superficial coat; just enough for the intended effect.</p><p class="double">With that, they flew to the upper balcony connected to Celestia&#039;s room, unchallenged due to the Guards&#039; orders that night. A quiet touchdown, and Discord held the opaque curtain to let her in first. Manners, after all, were key to sell this.</p><p class="double">A figure sat before the cool fireplace, of Alicorn height. The familiar magic emanating from her confirmed that this was the Solar Diarch, Luna&#039;s sister. With that, they began.</p><p class="double">&quot;Sis! We&#039;re back from our date!&quot; Nightmare Luna stepped forth, her indigo dress not <i>quite</i> as formal as something worn to the Grand Galloping Gala, but no member of the royal family worth their salt-lick would have the gala as a first date. Discord&#039;s formal jacket and bowtie were fit for royal business, only offset by the beret he wore with it. A fitting set of clothing for a date.</p><p class="double">Then the fire blazed forth, and two sets of eyes, accustomed to the gentle light of the Aurora and the full moon, snapped shut at the harsh light from it. Something in Luna&#039;s gut twinged; evidently, this Celestia was not willing to play along. Alas, the best plans of draconequui and mares...</p><p class="double">&quot;Sister... I think we need to discuss &#039;responsibility&#039;,&quot; said Celestia. &quot;A thousand years ago, you courted forces I would not consider, and took the title &#039;Nightmare Moon&#039;. A thousand years ago, I had to send you to the moon, for the safety of Equestria, and since then, I have had to move my Sun, your Moon, and the Stars...&quot;</p><p class="double">Luna peeled her eyes open a little, and stared at her sister, her jaw falling open in disbelief.</p><p class="double">&quot;<b>With. A. Crank.</b>&quot;</p><p class="double">Celestia&#039;s body, normally lithe in comparison to her little ponies, was overbuilt as only Bulk Biceps usually could be.</p><p class="double">Luna and Discord just stared, jaws agape, glanced at each other, then looked back to the flash of a camera. Celestia, for her part, had resumed her normal build and smile. &quot;To be fair, you two make a lovely couple.&quot;</p><p class="double">The two would-have-been pranksters slowly turned, and looked at each other, before the realization that they had been out-pranked set in. </p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">74.11</p><p class="double">“Well, Luna?” Celestia asked, smiling with perhaps a hint of nervousness. “Was your room alright?”</p><p class="double">“&#039;tis fine, sister.” Luna looked a little awkward. “I do not comprehend the meaning of all these new fittings and furnishings, but &#039;tis only to be expected after so long.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, well.”</p><p class="double">Celestia couldn&#039;t think of much more to say after that.</p><p class="double">“How are the ponies who aided me?” Luna asked, brightly.</p><p class="double">“Twilight and her friends? Well, Twilight decided to stay in Ponyville, to learn further the magic of friendship. I have asked her to send reports when she makes progress. Perhaps we could read them together?”</p><p class="double">“I thank thee, sister.” Luna nodded, slowly. “It would aid my recuperation, I think.”</p><p class="double">“That sounds good.” Celestia matched her nod, pleased that they had found something to work with. She turned to go...</p><p class="double">And a large scroll materialized in a curl of green fire.</p><p class="double">“Oh!” Celestia said, smiling wryly at her sister. “It seems her first report was early. Shall we?”</p><p class="double">Luna frowned. “Very well, if thou dost have the time to spare.”</p><p class="double">Celestia trotted over and sat down on Luna&#039;s bed, next to the Princess of the Night. Luna shuffled up a little to make room.</p><p class="double">“Quite a large scroll, is it not?” Luna commented, as Celestia unrolled the loose end.</p><p class="double">“It is...” Celestia agreed, then shrugged. “Well, we&#039;ll see.”</p><p class="double">She cleared her throat, and Luna shifted a little closer to her. Smiling, she put her wing over her sister. <i>&#039;Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">After some intensive friendship studies, I have learned the following lessons.</p><p class="double">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#039;ve learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings. But when there&#039;s not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. </p><p class="double">My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she&#039;s always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help she finds it hard to accept it. So while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it&#039;s also about accepting what our friends have to offer.</p><p class="double">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I learned that it&#039;s hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who&#039;s not so nice. Though it&#039;s impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who&#039;s true will surely come to light.</p><p class="double">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship: I was so afraid of being thought of as a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it&#039;s okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it&#039;s appropriate to show them off... Especially when you&#039;re standing up for your friends. </p><p class="double">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to report that we have caused a malingering dragon to depart our fair country, and that it was my good friend Fluttershy who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.</p><p class="double">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#039;s hard to believe that two ponies that seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other&#039;s differences-&#039;</p><p class="double"></i>“Celly,” Luna interrupted, frowning. “How many of these are there?”</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked, going back over what she&#039;d been reading. She then held the scroll about four feet from her face, and began counting under her breath.</p><p class="double">“Well?” Luna asked.</p><p class="double">“About fifty-five.”</p><p class="double">“...how long was I asleep for?” Luna blinked, looking down at her bed. “I had not thought it was more than one afternoon...”</p><p class="double">“No, it was.” Celestia puzzled over the scroll. “Hold on a moment, Lulu.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Celestia flashed into existence on the outskirts of Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“What has...” she began, then tailed off. Her jaw hung open.</p><p class="double">Ponyville was a wreck. Buildings were torn out of the ground, partially eaten, on fire, or just plain collapsed. There was a hydra being shooed off by the kindly pegasus Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">There was a knot of ponies, dragons, one griffin, several strange black pony-like creatures with insectoid wings, at least four other non-ponies of varying provenances and Discord in the town square, all standing in a semicircle around a familiar purple unicorn.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Here she comes,” Discord whispered.</p><p class="double">Twilight nodded to him, and then turned smiling to her mentor. “Princess! Good evening. Don&#039;t worry, everything&#039;s fine. I&#039;ve learned <i>so much</i> about friendship!”</p><p class="double">“...what happened here?” Celestia managed to ask, still astonished at Discord&#039;s presence.</p><p class="double">“Friendship cram school! I&#039;ve learned almost sixty lessons in one day!” Twilight beamed. “Don&#039;t worry, Zecora offered to help rebuild the town. She&#039;s a zebra!”</p><p class="double">Zecora waved.</p><p class="double">“...right.” Celestia shook her head. “I&#039;m sure this will make sense tomorrow.”</p><p class="double"></p><p></b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />

<p>75.1</p><p class="double">“Princess?” Twilight asked, as Celestia opened the door.</p><p class="double">“Ah, my faithful student!” Celestia greeted her, stepping back. “Come in, come in. I assume you have something to tell me?”</p><p class="double">“Yes, I did.” Twilight walked slowly in, and waited while Celestia shut the door. “Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.”</p><p class="double">“For you, Twilight, my door is always open.” Celestia started making some tea. “Now, what is it you wanted to say?”</p><p class="double">“Well... I&#039;d like to introduce myself.” Twilight looked down, frowning, then back up. “I promise it&#039;ll make sense. I&#039;m just... trying a novel way of approaching the subject.”</p><p class="double">“By all means,” Celestia agreed. “I must admit to being perplexed, but... by all means.”</p><p class="double">“Okay.” Twilight shifted slightly. “I am Twilight Sparkle. Daughter of Twilight Velvet and Night Light, sister of Shining Armor of the Royal Guard, and also sister to Spike. I am Princess Celestia&#039;s personal student.”</p><p class="double">“And glad I am to have you,” Celestia replied; Twilight, however, held up a hoof. When she spoke next, her stance had changed – she was unmistakably surer of herself.</p><p class="double">“I am Twilight Sparkle, Element of Magic and leader of the Elements of Harmony. I was involved in the defeat of Nightmare Moon, Discord, Chrysalis and Sombra, along with many other foes and problems.”</p><p class="double">Celestia blinked, shocked.</p><p class="double">There was a flash of purple light, and a golden tiara studded with amethysts appeared on Twilight&#039;s brow. Then Twilight flared as brightly as the jewellery had.</p><p class="double">When the light faded, she was nearly a foot taller, and had majestic wings.</p><p class="double">“I am Princess Twilight Sparkle, Princess of Magic,” she said quietly. “Alicorn, sister of one alicorn, sister-in-law of two alicorns, and mother of one. Third in precedence in Equestria, after Celestia and Luna.”</p><p class="double">With a faint <i>whump</i>, her magic turned from purple to deep orange, and the light coming through the window dimmed noticeably.</p><p class="double"><i>“I am Eternal Twilight, lady of the morning and the evening, almost-but-not-quite-too-dark-to-read-by ruler of Equestria.”</p><p class="double"></i>And then, the aura, wings and crown vanished, and Twilight was standing there as her normal unicorn self.</p><p class="double">“I am Twilight Sparkle, and I am in a time loop,” she finished. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.2</p><p class="double">Twilight Awoke, and looked around.</p><p class="double">It was the later end of her normal start position spread, by the looks of it... she was in the library, just before having Spike write the note to Celestia.</p><p class="double">Well, no reason to mess with the classics. Even if Spike had given her the nod they always shared when he was Awake.</p><p class="double">Just as she inhaled, though, a voice spoke over her.</p><p class="double">“Write this down, minion!”</p><p class="double">“I am <i>no-one&#039;s </i>minion, unicorn whelp,” a male voice slightly higher than Spike&#039;s tried to snarl. (The high pitch was a serious impediment.)</p><p class="double">“Write it down anyway,” continued the first voice. Twilight recognized it, and started to get a sinking feeling.</p><p class="double">“Dear Princess Celestia,” Trixie Lulamoon continued in the room next door, “We have uncovered incontrovertible evidence that your sister... let&#039;s call her Moonbutt... will return shortly. Do you want her exploded, set on fire or cured?”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Spike shared a confused glance.</p><p class="double">“...you might be tolerable,” the other male voice admitted grudgingly. “<i>Sending.</i>”</p><p class="double">The Anchor and her adoptive brother walked through the connecting doorway. “Hi, Trixie, who&#039;s your-” Twilight began.</p><p class="double">Spike held out a paw, stopping her. “Loop memories, Twi!”</p><p class="double">“...<i>oh.</i>”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle was one of Princess Celestia&#039;s two students, this loop. She and Trixie Lulamoon had each hatched a dragon egg at their entrance exams – twin eggs, in fact – and been taken in due to the sheer strength of their magical powers.</p><p class="double">Twilight had hatched the egg of purple Spykoranuvellitar, known as &#039;Spike&#039;. And Trixie had hatched the egg of red Smauglaureafeanaro... known as &#039;Smaug&#039;.</p><p class="double">“Well, this could be interesting...” Twilight commented absently. “Anyway. Hi, Trixie.”</p><p class="double">“Greetings, Twilight!” Trixie replied, turning with a smile. “Have you met my assistant?”</p><p class="double">“Both looping and not, yes,” Twilight confirmed. Spike nodded agreement. Then frowned, as a loop memory stood out.</p><p class="double">“Didn&#039;t you two burn down Canterlot Town Hall last year?”</p><p class="double">“That was just a fireworks display!” Trixie protested. “Sure, there were three thousand fireworks, and Smaug lit them with his fire, but that&#039;s my excuse-”</p><p class="double">“<i>Our</i> excuse,” Smaug interrupted. “Did I not come up with it?”</p><p class="double">“-<i>Our</i> excuse, thank you, and we&#039;re sticking to it.”</p><p class="double">Twilight and Spike exchanged another look.</p><p class="double">“We&#039;re doomed,” Spike opined. “But, on the plus side, it&#039;ll look pretty. From, you know, orbit.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.3 (novusordomundi)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>So, do you accept Me as your new God now, foolish mare? Are you willing to bow to the inevitable... HEY! STOP THAT!&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">Pinkie giggled as she put a bit of grilled pineapple on one of the headband&#039;s guisarmes, before turning to get some more fruit</p><p class="double">&quot;But it&#039;s a perfect use for you, silly! I mean, I enjoy using you as a headband, but any time I wear you, ponies keep complaining about your sharp points. I know it&#039;s not your fault, but my friends don&#039;t react well to accidentally being impaled by medieval weapons.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN USE ME AS A SKEWER!&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">Pinkie turned back, with a few more pieces of fruit in hooves, grinning at the stationary &quot;God of the Round&quot;.</p><p class="double">&quot;But I don&#039;t want you just collecting dust and trying to get me to switch religions. I mean, you&#039;re my friend, and I want to share you with everypony! And what other way to do that than...&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>Wait... You consider me... a friend?&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">&quot;Of course, silly. I know you&#039;d rather want a follower, but I think I know what you need, and that&#039;s someone you can share some good times with. Someone you can talk to and laugh and have fun with. And who better than me?&quot;</p><p class="double">The God of the Round stopped for a second, weighing thoughts in its head. Then...</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>Very well... I accept your... friendship...&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double">Pinkie grinned as she tingled all over as she started trying to figure out how to have a party for a headband.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>But really, skewing fruit on me?&quot; </b></i>If the headband could make a face, it would have been pouting a bit right now.</p><p class="double">&quot;Just say they are your blessings to the masses,&quot; Pinkie shrugged, as she impaled a grilled mango onto one of the guisarmes.</p><p class="double">&quot;<i><b>That COULD work...&quot;</b></i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.2 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Right,” Twilight said briskly one morning. “As I&#039;m sure you know, Trixie, having been through this all <i>so</i> many times-”</p><p class="double">Trixie Lulamoon, Official Unofficial Ponyville Performance Artist, made an expansive gesture. “Of course I know!”</p><p class="double">Twilight Sparkle, Official Librarian, nodded towards the red dragon slouched over one of the armchairs. “But <i>Smaug</i> doesn&#039;t. So I need to tell him.”</p><p class="double">“Then tell him, Twilight,” Trixie said carelessly. “Why are you bothering me?”</p><p class="double">Twilight counted to three. Backwards. From one thousand.</p><p class="double">“As I was saying. Smaug, a dragon moves into the local mountain about now, and we have to evict him one way or another. I&#039;m just extending you the invitation in case you want to get involved.”</p><p class="double">Smaug looked up, closing a book – which Twilight noticed was one of her copies of the <i>Silmarillion.</i> “I accept. I have had enough of this propaganda for one day.”</p><p class="double">“That&#039;s... unsettling...” Twilight mused. “Okay. Hold on while I go get the others.”</p><p class="double">“Must we?” The red dragon looked at her with dull eyes.</p><p class="double">“Hey, remember what I told you,” Spike pointed out. “Friends are where strength comes from.”</p><p class="double">“Yes, but these... they aren&#039;t even Awake!” Smaug waved out the window. “How can you maintain such a strong bond with them?”</p><p class="double">“Because they <i>are</i> our friends,” Twilight answered.</p><p class="double">Smaug frowned, but said nothing further.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“You call <i>this</i> a hoard?” Smaug demanded, striding into the cave as fast as his (short) legs could carry him.</p><p class="double">“I do, hatchling,” the dragon lying astride the pile of gold and gems answered. He blinked, slowly. “Leave now, before I give you the fate that awaits all thieves.”</p><p class="double">“You need not concern yourself with thievery,” Smaug replied, kicking a golden plate out of his path. “I would not steal <i>trinkets</i>.”</p><p class="double">“...<i>what</i> did you just say?” With a clattering of coins and a rustle of jewellery, the Old dragon rose from his posture of repose. “You, a mere stripling, come here and lecture <i>me</i> on what a hoard is?”</p><p class="double">“All there is in this cave is window dressing.” Smaug picked up some coins and let them run through his claws. “It looks pretty, and tastes good, but it has no <i>real</i> value.”</p><p class="double">With a gesture, he made a gleaming sword appear in his left hand. It was about the right scale for his current size. <i>“This</i> has value. It was awarded by Thorin Oakenshield, King of Dwarves, for destroying an army of our mutual foes and as payment for the great gem the Arkenstone.” Smaug turned the blade, letting filtered daylight catch the runes engraved into it – including four straight-edged draconic runes, clearly a later addition. “This is Orcrist Urulookeanna, and there are none like it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“...okay, I&#039;m kind of scared,” Spike whispered. “He actually <i>listened</i> to me?”</p><p class="double">“From what Trixie can tell, you made quite an impression.” Trixie paused. “With his body. In a mountain.”</p><p class="double">There was a bright flash from inside the cave. Then a roar, rumbling up through their feet.</p><p class="double">Then a flare as bright as the sun.</p><p class="double">Vantuvir the Black Smoke erupted through the side wall of his cave. Smaug followed, mouth blazing with white-hot dragonfire.</p><p class="double">“Ah,” Spike nodded. “<i>This</i> I recognize. Aggressive negotiations.”</p><p class="double">There was an “oooooh” from the Elements, gathered behind them. Another explosion, this time of red-cored black smoke, earned an “aaaaahh”.</p><p class="double">“I wonder if this Vantuvir would be willing to participate in my shows,” Trixie wondered aloud. “I could go into air shows.”</p><p class="double">“After today, I suspect he&#039;ll demand a protection spell,” Twilight said delicately.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.4 (misterq)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">The prisoner looked on as the reinforced door swooshed open letting in someone he assumed was yet another unevolved gawker.</p><p class="double">&quot;So, are you going to stare at me all day? Perhaps throw some peanuts or tap the glass?&quot; he sneered.</p><p class="double">&quot;Nope. I just came by to ask why you were, in technical terms, such a meanie-head,&quot; said the young lady, her reddish curls bobbing as she smiled. She had on the same kind of outfit that was shared by most of the grunts in this place.</p><p class="double">&quot;Meanie-head? My reasons are my own. Why should I answer to you?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, I suppose I can try to cheer you up. Although, I think some of my efforts sometimes have the opposite effect. Rarely.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I&#039;ve been trapped in a tiny prison, a prison that can be ejected towards the ground whenever your boss wants. I&#039;ve been bored out of my skull, waiting for my inevitable execution,&quot; the lanky black haired individual snorted. &quot;In other words, do your worst!&quot;</p><p class="double">The red-haired lady just smiled wider, &quot;Okie dokie, Loki.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">&quot;What the hell happened?&quot; Nick Fury demanded.</p><p class="double">One of his subordinates answered, &quot;Apparently, one of our crew briefly spoke with the prisoner. Then she put on the ten hour version of Nyan Cat on repeat and set the volume to change randomly at odd intervals.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And no one noticed for how long?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Twelve days. She posted a notice on the door that stated the prisoner was not to be disturbed by anyone. She made it look like official orders, sir. Automatic food and water dispensers ensured that the prisoner didn&#039;t perish.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;And how is the prisoner doing?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;He&#039;s still alive.&quot; The subordinate looked over his report, &quot;The doctors say he&#039;s starting to use verbs again.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nick Fury thought for a moment. &quot;Who&#039;s the person who did this?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Diane Pinkamena Pie.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Find this Diane Pinkamena Pie. Give her a full psych check and a promotion.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I would hold off on the psych eval.&quot;</p><p class="double">Nick Fury raised his eyebrow.</p><p class="double">&quot;I... I&#039;ve read her file. She used to visit all of her old therapists at the asylum.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;I am guessing they were not there as doctors.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;No, sir. They were not.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.2 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why are we out here?” Smaug grumbled, putting the box of dynamite down.</p><p class="double">“Well, the Mayor said that Trixie could not test her explosives in town any more, unless she wanted to start paying for <i>windows</i>.” Trixie shook her head, her face hang-dog. “I had <i>nearly</i> worked out how to make an explosive which would be soundless...”</p><p class="double">“...I must admit that the concept is intriguing...” Smaug said, frowning. “How would that work?”</p><p class="double">“The sound would be ultrasonic and vent most of the sound-based energy directly upwards.” Trixie opened the box with magic. “Right, let&#039;s see... one of these was minimizing auditory signature in favour of light signature, and one was the other way around. I can&#039;t remember which...”</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy raised a hoof tentatively, and pulled her bright pink earmuffs off one ear. “Why am I out here?”</p><p class="double">“Oh. Well, heh...” Trixie winced. “Last time I tried testing these, I summoned an Ursa Minor. So I wanted to have you around to... defuse things with the local wildlife. No pun intended,” she added as Smaug chuckled.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded timidly. “If I can help, that&#039;s fine...”</p><p class="double">She screwed up her eyes, pulled her earmuffs back over her ears, and sat down on the earth with her hooves holding them in place.</p><p class="double">“...well, may as well use trial and error,” Trixie decided. “Whichever one of these makes a very loud bang, that is from the side of the box I put the loud ones in.”</p><p class="double">She shot two small spells at the fuzes, which began to hiss. “Fire in the hole!”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">When the concussion died away, Smaug got up (Trixie&#039;s idea of &#039;loud bang&#039; would have done credit to a small volcano, and he&#039;d been knocked sprawling) and looked with appreciation at the blast scarring and the crater.</p><p class="double">There was something missing, though. Two somethings.</p><p class="double">“...where did you go?” he asked, looking around. The pegasus and the unicorn appeared to have vanished into thin air.</p><p class="double">The ground heaved up, and some kind of canine creature that looked like a cross between a warg and an orc dug his way into the air.</p><p class="double">“You. Have you seen two ponies?” Smaug asked, facing the newcomer.</p><p class="double">It appeared to ignore him, turning to face down the hole it had left. “No more pony. Only dragon.”</p><p class="double">When Smaug spoke next, his voice had a kind of silky quality. “Did you take them?”</p><p class="double">“Of course,” the dog-like tunneller said, matter-of-factly. “Ponies pull minecarts.”</p><p class="double">“Right. <i>Right.</i>” Smaug took a deep breath, and then exhaled a roaring wall of flame at the luckless Rover.</p><p class="double">Before the Diamond Dog could even start trying to extinguish his rapidly burning fur, Smaug was at the hole and blasting it ten feet wide with a lance-like beam of dragonfire.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“I really need to learn not to do things like that,” Trixie said to nobody in particular.</p><p class="double">She was <i>still</i> flash-blinded from the explosion, she couldn&#039;t hear herself speaking, and while both problems <i>could</i> be solved by going alicorn she didn&#039;t feel like explaining everything to Fluttershy.</p><p class="double">Besides, she could totally get them out of this once her eyesight returned.</p><p class="double">Then the ground shook.</p><p class="double">A wave of heat rolled over her.</p><p class="double">“Trixie apologizes to her rescuer,” she said, as distinctly as she could, “but she is currently not only blind but also deaf. Which way is out?”</p><p class="double">Moving air let her know someone was approaching, and then some claws tapped her shoulder lightly.</p><p class="double">“Well, this will be fun...” Trixie muttered.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“So, yeah,” Trixie concluded, blinking rapidly. “Smaug led Fluttershy and I out of the complex – I assume melting new doorways a few times – and then we got back here and you fixed my eyesight and hearing. No harm done.”</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy gave Smaug a quick glance. “...thank you, Smaug.”</p><p class="double">The red dragon shrugged.</p><p class="double">“Actually,” Twilight said, looking thoughtful. “I have a couple of questions for Smaug. First – you didn&#039;t kill anyone, did you?”</p><p class="double">Smaug examined his claws. “They weren&#039;t <i>worthy</i> of that much attention.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Twilight nodded, still frowning. “And the second question. Why, precisely, did you do it?”</p><p class="double">Smaug stopped moving for a moment.</p><p class="double">He recovered quite quickly, and affected a relaxed attitude, but the Equestrian Loopers had all seen it.</p><p class="double">“Well, I did want a fight – it&#039;s been a while,” he said, shrugging. “And I <i>do</i> owe Fluttershy of Everfree a debt for her help.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy frowned. “It was no trouble, really. And-” she caught sight of the clock on the mantelpiece, and winced. “Oh, no. Sorry, Twilight, I need to get back home soon. Angel&#039;s hurt his toe, and I need to change the poultice.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s okay,” Twilight said, shrugging. “Go ahead.”</p><p class="double">As soon as she was out of the door, Twilight turned back to Smaug. “You know, I don&#039;t believe you.”</p><p class="double">“Why not?” Smaug asked, lip twitching as though it wanted to curl into a snarl. “It <i>has</i> been a while.”</p><p class="double">“But you just said that the Diamond Dogs weren&#039;t worth your attention,” Twilight replied. “And it takes considerably more attention not to kill them, if you&#039;re actually fighting them.”</p><p class="double">&quot;Precisely. I put no effort into making them dead or keeping them alive.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight dragged the argument back on track. &quot;But that means this wasn&#039;t even a fight, just a rescue.”</p><p class="double">The red dragon looked mildly uncomfortable. “So what if it was? Rescues are more challenging.”</p><p class="double">“And this isn&#039;t the looping Fluttershy – you made just that point a few months ago.”</p><p class="double">Smaug pressed his lips closed.</p><p class="double">“Smaug,” Spike spoke up for the first time. “It&#039;s not an admission of weakness if you just wanted to help them. Or that you like someone.”</p><p class="double">“I <i>don&#039;t!</i>” Smaug snapped. “I...”</p><p class="double">He trailed off.</p><p class="double">After examining him for a minute or so, Twilight looked away. “If you don&#039;t want to admit it, fine. But we&#039;re not going to laugh at you if you did.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.5</p><p class="double">“One measure of Earth-normal gin, please. And some tonic.”</p><p class="double">Mac considered his customer as he poured out the drink. “Ain&#039;t all that often y&#039;all are in here alone. Captain.”</p><p class="double">Shining Armor shrugged wordlessly, letting his unlatched suit of armour fall off. His wings, revealed by the loss of the armour, twitched slightly.</p><p class="double">“Ah. Prince, then.” Mac slid the drink in front of him. “Enjoy.”</p><p class="double">The alicorn reached out with his magic and lifted the glass gently, then took a small bubble in an independent telekinetic field and drank it. Swirling it around once to enjoy the taste, he swallowed. “Ah, that <i>does</i> help.”</p><p class="double">“Help with what, if&#039;n you don&#039;t mind my askin&#039;, yer highness?” Mac requested.</p><p class="double">“Well.” Shining gestured to his wings, which half-opened for a moment. “I lost track of the loop, and got seen by Cadence – who isn&#039;t Awake this time – as an alicorn. And...”</p><p class="double">He sighed. “I don&#039;t know why it bothers me. But it brought home again how... in some ways, I <i>do</i> feel kind of alone.”</p><p class="double">Mac blinked.</p><p class="double">“Somethin&#039; up with y&#039;all&#039;s marriage? I mean-”</p><p class="double">“No, nothing like that.” Shining shook his head. “We still love one another, that hasn&#039;t changed. But... well. In the loops... I&#039;m the only <i>prince.</i> The only male alicorn.”</p><p class="double">The earth pony (who was resolutely an earth pony) frowned. “I ain&#039;t an alicorn, it&#039;s true. But what about Spike, an&#039; Discord?”</p><p class="double">“Neither of them are alicorns either. I know they&#039;re... well, they <i>have been</i> rulers, but it isn&#039;t the same.” Shining frowned. “This probably sounds like I&#039;m complaining over nothing, but...”</p><p class="double">“I do understand where y&#039;all are coming from, yup.” Mac topped up the glass. “An&#039; I know it can get wearyin&#039;.”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s just...” Shining shrugged. “The Elements, and the other loopers, are great... but, well. Sometimes, I just feel a need to be &#039;one of the guys&#039;. I can&#039;t do that when I don&#039;t really have much in common with the other guys.”</p><p class="double">“Go on, if&#039;n you please, yer highness,” Mac said.</p><p class="double">“Well, <i>you</i> keep referring to me by my title,” Shining pointed out. “Which doesn&#039;t really help.”</p><p class="double">Mac winced.</p><p class="double">“And Discord... well, it&#039;s just plain <i>hard</i> to relate to him. I think my sister and some of her friends do fairly well, but... not me.”</p><p class="double">“You&#039;ve got t&#039; accept &#039;em as they are,” Mac volunteered. “But Discord is one o&#039; the strange ones, yep.”</p><p class="double">“Spike is... easier.” The prince shrugged, both his forelegs and his wings. “We were friends, if not all that close, before the loops. Now, with both of us married and both of us Twilight&#039;s brothers, we&#039;re pretty similar. But, at the same time...”</p><p class="double">Shining trailed off helplessly. “It&#039;s just... not the same. And it shouldn&#039;t matter, but it does.”</p><p class="double">Mac refilled his glass again.</p><p class="double">“Well, ah don&#039;t know if there&#039;s an easy answer fer that one,” he said after a moment. “Might just be tiredness, might be whatever. But y&#039;all have a point about th&#039; way ah talk to you... Shining.”</p><p class="double">Shining gave him a tight smile. “Thank you for making an effort.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.2 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Come on, Smaug,” Spike called. “You were hatched on the same day as me this loop, this is your birthday as well!”</p><p class="double">Smaug&#039;s head rose from the bed. “...birth day? Why is this worthy of commemoration?”</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s kind of a celebration of the life of the person, as much as anything,” Spike replied, frowning. “Being glad that they&#039;re a friend, that they&#039;re a year older. It&#039;s their day.”</p><p class="double">Spike paused. “Just don&#039;t let it go to your head, because if dragons like we are now do that too much then you turn into a huge monster. And that <i>never</i> goes well.”</p><p class="double">Smaug lay back down on the bed. “I see no reason to get involved.”</p><p class="double">“You get presents...” Spike reminded him.</p><p class="double">A long pause. Then Smaug let out a sigh, and got up. “Oh, very well.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Why is there such a tendency for mundanity?” Smaug muttered, looking at the latest present. (Trixie had given him a book about liquid rocket fuels.) “I am sure that I will <i>eventually</i> read it, but... they are not precious, not valuable, what worth do they have?”</p><p class="double">“They&#039;re useful, or just nice to have,” Spike tried to explain. “Presents are as important for what they <i>mean</i> as what they <i>are</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Not convinced...” Smaug replied in a low voice.</p><p class="double">They looked up at the sound of nearby hooves.</p><p class="double">“Um...” Fluttershy began. “Spike, I&#039;d like you to have this.”</p><p class="double">She reached into her left saddlebag, and pulled out a wrapped package.</p><p class="double">“Thanks!” Spike said, smiling at her, and opened it efficiently with a claw. “Oh, nice!”</p><p class="double">He lifted the woollen sweater from the package. “Thanks, &#039;shy. Did you knit this yourself?”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy nodded quickly.</p><p class="double">“You&#039;re really good at it.” Spike turned it around, found the base, and slipped it on. “What do you think?”</p><p class="double">“Um... it looks good,” Fluttershy volunteered. “But I&#039;m sure that&#039;s you, not the sweater...”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t be too hard on yourself,” Spike waved a hand. “I mean, it <i>is</i> good. Just, you know, don&#039;t overdo it either. This thick is fine for me, &#039;cause dragons don&#039;t overheat... hey, maybe you could do these for everyone for Hearth&#039;s Warming?”</p><p class="double">“...okay,” Fluttershy nodded. “Oh, I had something for Smaug as well.”</p><p class="double">Another parcel came out of the other saddlebag, and Smaug shredded the paper open.</p><p class="double">Unlike Spike&#039;s one, it wasn&#039;t a sweater. In fact, it was a scarf.</p><p class="double">Smaug picked it up carefully, unfolded it, and looked at both sides. The pattern wasn&#039;t particularly novel, as such – red scales picked out in gold – but the thing which was really surprising was the sheer length.</p><p class="double">“Fluttershy...” Spike said, uncertainly. “That scarf has got to be at least thirty feet long.”</p><p class="double">“Oh, er...” Fluttershy blushed. “I didn&#039;t know how long to do it, so I asked Trixie, and she said &#039;the longer the better&#039;. Then she winked?” The pegasus pushed her hooves together, wincing. “I&#039;m sorry if it&#039;s too long...”</p><p class="double">“No...” Smaug said, his voice absent the usual sharpness. “This is fine. My thanks.”</p><p class="double">Fluttershy smiled, though it still looked a bit nervous. “Uh, that&#039;s okay...”</p><p class="double">The red dragon wrapped the scarf around his neck several times, letting both ends trail down his back. “I am sure I will grow into it.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Er... you <i>do</i> know our loop is only about five years?” Spike asked, after Fluttershy had left.</p><p class="double">“I do,” Smaug confirmed.</p><p class="double">“But... does that mean you&#039;re going to keep it? I mean, in your-”</p><p class="double">“<i>Yes,</i>” Smaug replied, in a tone that brooked no further comment.</p><p class="double">Wisely, Spike shut up.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.6</p><p class="double">“So, girls,” Nyx asked, hovering a foot or so above the floor. “I had this idea.”</p><p class="double">“Go on...” Applebloom said, not a little warily.</p><p class="double">“Right. Anyway, we should think up evil forms for you all.” She smiled apologetically. “&#039;cept for you, of course, Silver.”</p><p class="double">“Why don&#039;t I get an evil form?” Silverfur asked, white-grey furred tail lashing.</p><p class="double">“&#039;cause you ain&#039;t an alicorn, ah think,” Applebloom pointed out. “Besides, foxes are already kinda evil.”</p><p class="double">“More like tricksters,” Diamond Tiara interjected. “Remember, that nice Naruto fellow&#039;s got a fox motif.”</p><p class="double">“He&#039;s got a huge fox in his belly, more like,” Silverfur corrected.</p><p class="double">“Evil forms?” Nyx asked again.</p><p class="double">“Oh, right. Sure, sure.” Applebloom frowned. “Grinding Gears?”</p><p class="double">“Apple Wither?” Scootaloo asked.</p><p class="double">“Could work. Ah&#039;ll think about it. What about you, Scoots?”</p><p class="double">“I would be best as Blackened Tiara,” Diamond stated. “And Scootaloo should be Orange Baroness.”</p><p class="double">“Wrong Note?” Sweetie suggested.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s got a good sound to it,” Scootaloo agreed.</p><p class="double">“No it doesn&#039;t, that&#039;s the point.” Sweetie stuck her tongue out. “Right, good. That was quick. What should our demands be?”</p><p class="double">Applebloom reared up on her hind legs. With a double flash, Cookie and then her horn and wings appeared, and her mane transitioned to a complex nest of mechadendrites. “I am Apple Wither, Factory Owner of Darkness! The unpaid overtime shall last for <i>as long as regular working hours!</i>”</p><p class="double">Scootaloo kicked a handy cloud Pansy had just created, producing a roll of thunder.</p><p class="double">“Thanks!” Applebloom added brightly, nodding. “That really added to the effect.”</p><p class="double">“Pleasure.” Scootaloo tugged her mane, then started giggling.</p><p class="double">“You realize, of course, that under the rule of Blackened Tiara it will be illegal to wear nice-looking jewellery,” Diamond said, matching Applebloom&#039;s transformation. “No subject is allowed to look nicer than their ruler!”</p><p class="double">“And Wrong Note will <i>ban</i> any conversation that is not in song!”</p><p class="double">“You may think you have had the last laugh,” Scootaloo countered, transforming just a hair behind Sweetie Belle. “But the Orange Baroness&#039; army will conquer all below it!”</p><p class="double">Silvertail padded over to Nyx. “Is it me, or has this turned into a game of Civilization?”</p><p class="double">“It pretty much has, yeah.”</p><p class="double">“Mwa-ha-ha-haaaaa!” &#039;Blackened Tiara&#039; laughed.</p><p class="double">“No, too breathy,” &#039;Wrong Note&#039; said critically. “If you want it to carry, you need more power behind it.”</p><p class="double">Nyx looked Silver up and down. “Want to go wait on a cloud till they get it out of their system?”</p><p class="double">“...yeah, alright. Do you have a copy of that card game?”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.2 continued (TricornKing)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>“Spike?”</p><p class="double">“Yes Smaug?” said the purple dragon.</p><p class="double">“Why am I blindfolded? For that matter, why am I still blindfolded?”</p><p class="double">Spike quickly removed the blindfold. “Because of this!” he shouted, spreading his arms out to indicate their current location.</p><p class="double">Smaug just looked around, taking in Spike and their friends sans Fluttershy and their location. To his surprise, the ponies were all wearing camouflage outfits. “Why are we in a ditch?”</p><p class="double">“Because of that!” Trixie shouted, pointing up at the sky. As the others followed her lead, they watched in awe as the dragon migration passed by overhead.</p><p class="double">Spike was serving out tea and biscuits, wearing the pink frilly apron that he had from the baseline. He’d been expecting some kind of snarky comment from Smaug about it, but when he didn’t hear anything, he turned to his in-loop brother.</p><p class="double">Smaug was just standing there, gazing in rapture at the flying dragons above them. There even seemed to be a shimmer of tears in his eyes. Sidling closer to him, Spike said in a whisper, “Reminds you of home, doesn’t it?”</p><p class="double">“….yes,” said Smaug in a faraway voice. “After the War of Wrath, we dragons escaped to the North to live out our lives. Eventually we all separated and went our separate ways, but for a time…”</p><p class="double">The little red dragon turned his head slightly to Spike. “Tell me, what are the dragons here like?”</p><p class="double">Spike grimaced a bit. “In the baseline,” he whispered back, “I went after the migration to try and figure out who I was. I met a bunch of teenage dragons who at first gave me a hard time for living with ponies, then accepted me when I belly-flopped onto lava.” Nodding at Smaug’s wince, Spike continued, “They then tried to induct me into their ranks by getting me to smash a defenseless phoenix egg.”</p><p class="double">“Why? Did the parents attack them or the migration’s hatchlings?”</p><p class="double">“Nope. They just wanted to smash it because they felt like it.”</p><p class="double">A look of disgust passed over Smaug’s face. “Killing an unborn hatchling for laughs….vile.”</p><p class="double">Seeing Spike’s raised eyebrow, Smaug quickly added, “There’s no sport in killing the unborn. No glory to it.”</p><p class="double">“Whatever you say Smaug,” Spike said as he turned back to his other friends, a small smile on his face.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>75.7</p><p><i>Dear Princess Celestia,</p><p class="double">I have recently discovered that the Mare in the Moon is to return shortly.</p><p class="double"></i>Celestia perused the letter, thinking.

Across from her, Luna – about the same size as her dark-side-sister – beamed up at Twilight.</p><p class="double">“Can I have some more ice cream, Twi?”</p><p class="double">“Certainly,” Twilight replied, measuring out a large ice cream cone and passing it to the fillified alicorn. Then she measured out a slightly smaller one and gave it to Nyx.</p><p class="double">“No fair!” Nyx said, huffing. “Hers is larger!”</p><p class="double">“And impolite little alicorns don&#039;t get as much ice cream, do they, Nyx?” Twilight asked.</p><p class="double">Nyx crossed her forelegs and pouted. “Humph!”</p><p class="double">“Well, if you don&#039;t want any...”</p><p class="double">The darker-coloured filly looked at Twilight out of the corner of her eye. “Didn&#039;t say <i>that</i>.”</p><p class="double">“Well, there you go, then.” Twilight patiently held out the ice cream, until Nyx took it, humfed again, and started licking it enthusiastically.</p><p class="double">Celestia stood in the doorway, jaw dropped.</p><p class="double">“Oh, hello, Princess!” Twilight said, turning towards her mentor. “Don&#039;t worry, I think I can take care of them.”</p><p class="double">“Don&#039;t like you!” Nyx said, pointing at Celestia. “Not fair!”</p><p class="double">“But she&#039;s big sis Celestia!” Luna protested. “She&#039;s lovely!”</p><p class="double">“Well, she... she melts ice cream!” Nyx said with finality.</p><p class="double">Luna gasped.</p><p class="double">“...but... two... Luna and Nightmare... <i>how?</i>” Celestia managed.</p><p class="double">“It&#039;s magic, I don&#039;t have to explain it.” Twilight shrugged. “Now, Luna, Nyx, say sorry to your sister for trying to take over the world.”</p><p class="double">“Sorry, sis!” Luna said brightly.</p><p class="double">“Nyx?” Twilight pressed after a few seconds, a note of warning in her voice.</p><p class="double">“...s&#039;ry.” Nyx muttered grudgingly, and went back to her ice cream.<i></p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></i>“What do you think I should do?” Twilight asked her two &#039;daughters&#039;. (She&#039;d managed to get the adoptions both made legal, at least partly because of one of Ivory&#039;s pre-prepared Legal Bamboozlement packs.)</p><p class="double">“Um...” Luna hovered up to neck height, wings buzzing frantically, and looked at the exposed Chrysalis. “She tried to ruin a wedding, but I think she&#039;s nice really.”</p><p class="double">Nyx copied her, rising up on Twilight&#039;s other side. “She hurt big sis Celestia! Get her!”</p><p class="double">“But we can&#039;t just do that!” Luna protested. “We have to be nice!”</p><p class="double">“Do I get to choose?” Chrysalis asked.</p><p class="double">“Nope,” both fillies chorused.</p><p class="double">Behind Chrysalis, in the distance, there was a bright flash as Spike took a photo of the scene.</p><p class="double">When else were they going to get a picture of Twilight with a shoulder angel and a shoulder demon?</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.2 continued</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“These traps are <i>stupid!</i>” Trixie shouted, firing an explosive spell at the door in front of them. “My worst fear is <i>not possible</i>, that&#039;s <i>stupid!</i>”</p><p class="double">“It showed your worst fear when you tried to open it?” Smaug asked, frowning at the large door. “What did it show?”</p><p class="double">“I was alone, on stage, with everyone throwing tomatoes at me, and there was a poster on the back wall saying that explosives no longer functioned,” Trixie said, still attacking the door. “It&#039;s physically and chemically impossible! I mean, I&#039;m <i>good</i> at performing!”</p><p class="double">“...you realize that door hasn&#039;t changed in the whole time you&#039;ve been blasting it, right?” Smaug pointed out.</p><p class="double">“So?” Trixie shot back. “It&#039;s going to give in one day!”</p><p class="double">“Oh, let me do it.” The juvenile dragon shoved her none-too-gently out of the way, inhaled, and fired a blaze of white-blue fire with shimmering mach diamonds in the middle of the stream.</p><p class="double">The world lurched-</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Smaug lay on a great golden hoard.

Smaug?”</p><p class="double">Smaug&#039;s eyes opened.</p><p class="double">There was a hoof prodding his shoulder, and he was face down on the ground. Something was glowing brightly in front of him.</p><p class="double">“What...”</p><p class="double">“Are you alright?” a voice he recognized as Trixie asked, concerned. “You blew the door up – which, by the way, was <i>awesome</i>, I have to Ascend to make that happen – and then collapsed.”</p><p class="double">“I see.” Smaug formed a fist, and punched the ground. Then stood, a little shakily. “What now?”</p><p class="double">“Uh...” Trixie frowned. “We go through here, there&#039;s some stupidly long stairway, and then Sombra shows up. Look, it&#039;ll probably be easier if I keep him occupied and you take the Heart, you clearly had a bad reaction to whatever your worst fear was.”</p><p class="double">“I did not-” Smaug bit off the end of the sentence, growled, and nodded. “You&#039;re right. I did. And I <i>hate</i> that.”</p><p class="double">“Happens to all of us sometimes,” Trixie said sympathetically. “I had pretty serious issues with self-worth for a while. Right, we&#039;d better hurry.”</p><p class="double">As she spoke, her horn glowed. <i>“Fly.”</p><p class="double"></i>“You could do this <i>all along?</i>” Smaug asked, warning in his voice as they rocketed along.</p><p class="double">“We try to give the authentic experience to anyone who&#039;s bored,” Trixie replied airily. “I hear Sparkle used the ceiling as a <i>slide</i> the first time, you&#039;re actually pretty lucky.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">“Well, I&#039;m stuck,” Trixie said in a bored voice, kicking desultorily at the black crystal cage. “Smaug. You&#039;d better take the Heart. I&#039;ll hold him off.”</p><p class="double">“Your acting needs work,” Smaug informed her, picking up the Crystal Heart.</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m not exactly trying to win an award here,” Trixie informed him primly. “And, for my next performance, I will defeat an evil unicorn without moving!”</p><p class="double">A shield sprang up around her.</p><p class="double">“That means get going,” Trixie added. “Off you go.”</p><p class="double">Smaug rolled his eyes, turned, and set off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">A black shape of crystal and smoke headed directly towards the running dragon, turning into King Sombra as it did so.</p><p class="double">“Let&#039;s see if this works...” Smaug muttered to himself, then energy crackled around his claws and teeth.</p><p class="double">He opened his mouth, and the fire that issued forth this time was a lance of purple and white shot through with deep red.</p><p class="double">He&#039;d learned how to do this a long time ago in Faerun. It was called &#039;Rebuking Breath&#039;. The main question was whether this Sombra counted as &#039;undead&#039;... or close enough, at any rate.</p><p class="double">After a moment, the flames died down, and he could see the fruits of his efforts – the dark unicorn was suspended in mid-air, conflicting energies roiling across his body.</p><p class="double">Smaug decided that probably meant &#039;close enough&#039;, and continued running.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Since they&#039;d been running fairly close to baseline – just having Twilight stay with the fake Heart to protect it, and assigning Trixie and Smaug to the task of carrying the real Heart – the celebration and stained-glass window and all that followed were quite familiar to Twilight.</p><p class="double">She was impressed with the visitor, though. He&#039;d really improved over his time in Equestria, especially compared to the first time he&#039;d turned up and tried to incinerate the place...</p><p class="double">Now, however, the celebrations were done, and they were all back in Ponyville.</p><p class="double">“Is that the last of the calamities your Loop has for the unwary?” Smaug asked, sitting heavily down in an armchair.</p><p class="double">“Not quite,” Twilight replied, shaking her head. “One or two more of the same scale, but if you&#039;re all stressed out then Trixie and I can handle those.”</p><p class="double">“Ask me again nearer the time,” the Dragon Dread decided.</p><p class="double">“Will do.” Twilight nodded, then brightened. “Oh, I was going to tell you. We – Trixie, Spike and I, as well as Shining and Cadence – wanted to let you have first pick of Sombra&#039;s treasury, because you were so instrumental in defeating him.</p><p class="double">“...I believe I will decline,” he said eventually.</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked. “Really?”</p><p class="double">“Really,” Smaug confirmed. “I believe I have memories enough.”</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.8 (Valentine Meikin)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight wondered what was going on as she noticed two stallions stood, one with a stopwatch, the other with a clipboard, stood waiting for something, after having been interrupted by the sound of a Sonic Rainboom.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re testing the myth of that Sonic The Hedgehog IS the fastest thing alive,&quot; the one with the stopwatch stated, as he walked over to where his beret had fallen as a familiar blue hedgehog skidded into a furrow in the dirt, Rainbow Dash arriving a split second later.</p><p class="double">&quot;Plausible,&quot; the one with the clipboard stated, adjusting his glasses. &quot;Without ascension, the hedgehog is slightly faster, but we can&#039;t test post-ascension within an atmosphere.&quot;</p><p class="double">Twilight blinked several times over, wondering why they were doing something like this, noticing now the clipboard had various times and criteria.</p><p class="double">&quot;You know how some things say, &#039;Don&#039;t try this at home. Please leave it to the professionals&#039;?&quot; the clipboard holding stallion stated.</p><p class="double">&quot;We&#039;re professionals,&quot; the other stallion stated, then, giving each other a hoof bump, walked off.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">75.9 (Gym Quirk)</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>Having a high-powered arcane practitioner along made for a refreshing change to an otherwise baseline run, concluded Luke Skywalker.</p><p class="double">He, Chewbacca, and Scootaloo were tidying up the detention reception area while Twilight had gone to spring Leia from her cell. Seeing the Equestrian anchor in action was enough to make him consider dusting off some of the magical skills he&#039;d picked up from other fusion loops and then allowed to atrophy. &quot;Wrong context magic&quot; Spike had called it when they&#039;d discussed their Force abilities and alternate methods of achieving similar effects. Twilight&#039;s magic had proved to be quite versatile and did not leave much of a disturbance in the Force for others to detect. It would be worth deeper consideration when he had time.</p><p class="double">It was almost scary how cleanly their intrusion into the detention block had gone. Start with the usual banter with the guard detail, Chewbacca suddenly &quot;breaking free&quot; of his restraints...</p><p class="double">And then Twilight emerged from behind the Wookiee and paralyzed all the Imperials with a word and a gesture with her staff. Luke could have performed a similar feat via Force Stasis, but that would have set off a clearly detectable ripple for Vader to pick up. There was no inconvenient dead imperial slumped on top of the alarm button this time.</p><p class="double">Dealing with the remote monitor cameras and automated defense turrets was something of an afterthought.</p><p class="double">To prove that he had some crossover loop cred of his own, Chewbacca had rendered one of the stormtrooper guards unconscious with a Vulcan neck pinch. Through his armor. All had agreed that it was suitably impressive.</p><p class="double">Returned to the reception area after depositing the Imperials in an unused cell, Luke and Chewbacca heard the tail end of a conversation.</p><p class="double">&quot;...not the first time I&#039;ve seen a late awakening alter someone&#039;s appearance,&quot; Twilight was saying.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yeah. Remind me to tell you about the time a bunch of us were on the <i>Enterprise</i> and Silver Spoon came in late,&quot; added Scootaloo.</p><p class="double">Luke blinked. Leia had Changed.</p><p class="double">Gone were the brown hair and eyes. The familiar twin-bun hairdo was rendered almost unrecognizable by the violet, rose, and pale gold colors that were swirled into the pattern. Her eyes were now a light purple that almost matched Twilight&#039;s skin. She was also several centimeters taller.</p><p class="double">&quot;Ah. Introductions,&quot; blurted Twilight spotting the loop natives. &quot;Chewie, Luke...May I present Her Highness, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, Co-ruler of the Crystal Empire and my sister-in-law? Cadance...May I present Chewbacca, first mate of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, and Luke Skywalker, potential Grand Master of the New Jedi Order? I believe you already know Captain Solo...&quot;</p><p class="double">Scootaloo snorted amusement as the three made polite bows toward one another. A beep from her comlink interrupted the ceremonies. &quot;What&#039;s up, Sweetie?&quot; asked the pilot.</p><p class="double">&quot;Apple Bloom says she&#039;ll be finished up here in about five minutes and we&#039;ll be relocating. You can trigger the alarm any time after that,&quot; reported the protocol droid.</p><p class="double">&quot;Oh, fern. All three of them?&quot; Cadance asked Twilight in an undertone.</p><p class="double">&quot;Yep. Spike too. He&#039;s off taking care of the tractor beam,&quot; answered the twi&#039;lek. &quot;Look. I&#039;ve got my own errand to run. I&#039;ll meet you all back at the ship. I&#039;ve got teleport coordinates for the main compartment if things get hairy,&quot; she said as she entered a turbolift.</p><p class="double">&quot;Wait. You&#039;re deliberately setting off the alarm here?&quot; asked Cadance as the doors closed.</p><p class="double">&quot;We need to give Tarkin and Vader a reason to put a homing device on the <i>Falcon</i>,&quot; explained Luke.</p><p class="double">Cadance paused to consider this. &quot;Oookaaayyy...I think I follow the reasoning. And then we get to play hide-and-seek with the patrols for the next twenty-to-thirty minutes?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Pretty much.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just to be clear, this is the part where all pretence of sticking to the baseline go down the proverbial garbage chute?&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Well, we&#039;d like to get off the Death Star first, but yeah.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Okay.&quot; She shuffled in the sleeves of her robe and produced a Minbari collapsible fighting pike and a metal ring about 30 centimetres in diameter.</p><p class="double">&quot;Where&#039;d you get that?&quot; asked Scootaloo, indicating the pike.</p><p class="double">&quot;Diamond Tiara&#039;s not the only one who&#039;s done B5 loops. I&#039;ve also got a phaser rifle and a Hogwarts wand for backup.&quot;</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Twilight emerged from the turbolift onto the unpopulated cargo level. She looked at the square kilometers of deck space stacked with crates, cases, and containers and suppressed a sigh. Finding the cargo consignments Bloom had indicated would be more of a chore than it first seemed, even with the map downloaded to her datapad.</p><p class="double"><i>At least I should be able to handle the transmutation magic without going Alicorn</i>, she thought, shifting her grip on her staff.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">Sweetie and Apple Bloom were casually making their way to the recharge and monitor station near the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>&#039;s hangar when they were confronted by a harried-looking junior officer. &quot;You! Astromech! Are you familiar with the YT-1300?&quot;</p><p class="double">Bloom twittered an affirmative. Sweetie translated, &quot;My counterpart has basic knowledge of all Corellian Engineering Corporation vessels.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Great! Come with me. I need to get a homing beacon.&quot;</p><p class="double">They dutifully followed the officer to a hatch that accessed the armory for this group of hangar bays. The officer entered an access code -- carefully observed by Sweetie -- to open the door and fell to the stun beam from the phaser Apple Bloom had quietly deployed from one of her dome compartments. &quot;Quick. Drag him inside,&quot; she beeped.</p><p class="double">The protocol droid awkwardly tried to comply. After a few futile seconds, Bloom deployed her tow cable and had Sweetie rig a makeshift harness. &quot;I&#039;ve told you. This body just isn&#039;t built for physical activity,&quot; she fretted.</p><p class="double">&quot;Never mind that. Kin ya handle collectin&#039; the beacon? And kin I have a word with Clover?&quot;</p><p class="double">Performing the best approximation of a shrug her body could manage, Sweetie pulled out the Device containing Starswirl&#039;s student and put it on a convenient case of laser focusing lenses. She then went in search of the requested homing device.</p><p class="double">&quot;You feelin&#039; up to doin&#039; a little magic, Clover?&quot; asked Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double">The Device reconfigured itself into the form of an armored unicorn. &quot;That would depend on what sort of spells you had in mind.&quot;</p><p class="double">&quot;Just some minor healin&#039; and suggestion, and a few not-so-minor transmutations,&quot; started Apple Bloom.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double">With a whisper of Force Suggestion, Spike silently ghosted past the two guards and out of the compartment where the third stage tractor beam power regulator override was located. <i>Just what does the Empire have against safety rails?</i> he asked himself idly.</p><p class="double">Taking a moment to glance at his chrono, he started to consider how he would spend the next twenty minutes before returning to the <i>Falcon</i>&#039;s hangar bay. He could sense Vader&#039;s presence in that area, and he didn&#039;t want to force that encounter until his friends were in position to take advantage of the distraction the show would provide. And, he admitted to himself, it would be nice to have Luke, Twilight, and the others available if things turned ugly.</p><p class="double">Spotting an empty break room, he decided to see if there was anything interesting in the refrigeration unit.</p><p class="double"><hr></p><p class="double"></p><p>75.10</p><p class="double">“Behold, I am Smaug the Red!” the huge red dragon roared. “My voice is the clap of a thunderstorm, and-” he paused. “I do not recall Bilbo Baggins being female.”</p><p class="double">The hobbit below him smiled uncertainly. “Hello, mister Smaug...”</p><p class="double">Smaug crashed back down onto all fours, sending coins flying. “Is that Fluttershy I hear?”</p><p class="double">“Well... yes, actually.” She waved. “Though I&#039;m Flutter Flagons here. How are you?”</p><p class="double">“Fine, fine.” He gestured around with his head and one foreleg at the cavernous building. “I&#039;ve gone into politics, as you can see.”</p><p class="double">“I can.” Fluttershy smiled. “Mister Gandalf was quite confused. He didn&#039;t expect you to be Mayor of Laketown.”</p><p class="double">“The election was interesting...” Smaug allowed, unconsciously stroking the scarf wound around his neck. “I donated about half the hoard to Laketown – this is the treasury building – and got elected in a landslide. Have you met Sir Bard? He&#039;s the deputy Mayor.”</p><p class="double">“I have, yes.” Fluttershy looked back at the door. “He seems quite a grumpy guts. So, I hope you&#039;re doing better these days?”</p><p class="double">“Indeed I am.” The red dragon lay back down. “I was dubious at first as to whether I could truly find enjoyment in something other than violence or treasure, but your friends back in Equestria convinced me otherwise and it certainly appears to have worked.”</p><p class="double">“I&#039;m glad to hear it.” The hobbit rummaged in her pockets. “Now, what have I got in my pocket...”</p><p class="double">“The One Ring, I assume,” Smaug replied, rolling his eyes. “Should I destroy it right now? It would presumably save a great deal of trouble...”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that&#039;s in here as well. But there&#039;s something else everyone in Equestria decided you should have.” Fluttershy finally found what she was looking for in her Pocket, and withdrew a shining blue crystal about the size of two fists clasped together.</p><p class="double">“Is that the Crystal Heart?” Smaug asked, squinting down at it.</p><p class="double">“Yes, it is. Twilight went and got the one from your loop in Equestria just before the loop ended – we take turns carrying it, just in case one of us runs into you.” She looked down at it, then back up at him. “Twilight told me that you didn&#039;t want a reward, and that&#039;s really very good – it shows that you&#039;ve managed to get control of your own instincts. But consider this a well-done present.”</p><p class="double">Smaug the Unconquerable smiled. “Well how can I refuse? Thank you, Fluttershy.”</p><p class="double">“Really, it&#039;s no problem at all...” Flutter Flagons reaffirmed, putting the crystal down. “Remember to take it with you by the end of the loop.”</p><p class="double">“I will,” Smaug assured her, touching the scarf again.</p><p class="double">Fluttershy caught sight of it and smiled, but let it go. Then she gasped. “Oh, I nearly forgot the other thing I came in for! Where&#039;s the Arkenstone, please?”</p><p class="double">“Oh, that thing.” Smaug shrugged his massive wings. “I left it in the Lonely Mountain with the other half of my gold. They&#039;re welcome to it.”</p><p class="double">“Lovely.” Fluttershy reached into her pocket, and flipped the One Ring into the air.</p><p class="double">A spear of roaring dragonfire, two inches wide and too bright to look at, caught it at the apex of the throw.</p><p class="double">Something shook the earth.</p><p class="double">A puddle of molten metal landed on the flagstones with a bubbly <i>hiss</i>.</p><p class="double">“Pleasure doing business with you, miss Fluttershy,” Smaug rumbled amicably.</p><p class="double">“Nice to see you as well, Smaug.”</p><p class="double"><hr> </b></u></i></span></center></blockquote></p>				<hr />
